  Seems a little weird. If it's always been that way then yes.. it would be nice getting a message.. thinking about you, checking in to see how your day was/their day or atleast a good night message. Like 10 hours isn't really asking for much lol it literally takes a second to write something. It's especially worse if they are someone who always has their phone on them no matter how busy they could get.

   If your partner said ‚Äúi have doubts about what you really feel idk maybe i‚Äôm just fucked up and it‚Äôs my brain telling me,‚Äù how would you feel? would that make you feel shitty and enough reason to break up?
  ","
  That would be a weird reason to break up over. I'd want to know why they feel that way, reassure them of my feelings, do more to show them as well. I'd want to know if they always felt that way about the relationship or something new they've been thinking. Open communication is key. I'd probably think of stuff that could have been my fault too. I'd want to hear the doubts even if it hurts or complicated to get out. It should make the people grow closer not a battle... if they don't hear the person out then that's even more shitty than someone trying to get their feelings out. I wouldn't want someone who can't get validation out of their words/thoughts.

  Checked on the hamster. He had full food & water. Was sleeping.
  
  Made myself breakfast
  
  Been online a bit
  
  Climbed the stairs up and down all day.. 17 total so wonder how many times lol my fitbit only calculates steps :/
  
  Got ready
  
  Made myself lunch and packed my backpack with stuff I'd need
  
  Walked to the country club. Went to the gym for a while. Took the picture. Ate my lunch. Went swimming, played basketball in the pool. Called my sister as I had a missed call from her. Went back on my phone to see evil anon. Changed into shorts instead  of my leggings & walked back
  
  Gave dogs water again as it was out. Including kibble. Gave the cat water too as it was running low.
  
  Changed clothes
  
  Music going as it's too quiet here by myself lol
  
  Made myself dinner and a snack.
  
  Took out the trash
  
  Now relaxing. All animals are next to me besides the hamster, he's upstairs in my nephew's room.

  Yes. Reminds me of the time I got lost in the woods :( was with a huge group and then the next instant they disappeared. Didn't know where to go. Haven't been there before. Luckily, I found my way out again but I was definitely pissed and scared at those people. However one girl stayed back and was chilling outside on the porch and we were talking so it wasn't a total fail of the night. We didn't talk much before that.
  
  My grandparents just moved to a new area. It was Christmas and my sister and I felt like going for a walk. They had woods nearby. We kept going further into the woods. It was getting darker. I wanted to leave so we ended up splitting up. They also had wild turkeys making noises.

  2 years that didn't go anywhere pretty much. He was younger, didn't go to the same school. Wasted time. First person I ever dumped. I wanted to be free over the summer + my senior year of high school incase someone much better came along. It was good since we weren't right for each other at all. His friend liked him and told him that while dumping him lol they dated soon afterwards ü§£ idk what he's up to.. I deleted him off fb since we'd only exchange birthday greetings afterwards and sh!t was getting annoying lol
  
  Friend of a friend. We kind of just distanced ourselves. His ex was coming back to town. I didn't feel like fighting for him didn't know him that long and clearly I meant nothing to him as well since the last time we talked he mentioned the ex and never called again lol I imagine they got back together. He died a few years ago.

  I have a graphic communications degree. I did more copy jobs and that's not what I'd want to do forever. Going to college changed my mind about being a teacher. I was more interested in psychology classes. Ended up moving and haven't attended any classes since. I go back and forth between wanting to go back and actually having a degree catered to psychology. I was just doing liberal arts at the time. Don't know if they'd transfer over. College isn't free here either.
  
  Nobody likes me in that way. They don't get to know me. Just catcalls, headnods, them thinking ""hi"" is acceptable way to start something lol I also usually have long breaks between new people so that's always awesome too -_- #foreveralone

  This huge sand dune type thing with water all around it. The water was pretty calm but the sand made it hard to get out of the water.

Swallowing water like something was holding me down... idk was odd since I don't usually dream of water or sand.

  I guess the whole fat debate going on right now. Like I know  I'm way smaller than I have been, different body composition and all that but I'm still big by definition. Pcos and fatty liver doesn't help that either. I'm not a healthy bmi. I don't think that truly matters since doesn't take muscles and other things in consideration. Still overweight, chubby, fat...
  
  Like I'm just saying how it is. I'm not even tearing my body or bad thoughts about myself - its just the truth of the matter. I'm not saying it to get compliments either saying that ""I'm not fat"" lol like i know my body more than others do ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

   What‚Äôs the difference between loneliness and being alone? Do you believe that the capacity to be alone is the capacity to love? If you feel a certain feeling, do you just let it be, own it, or you have to distract yourself from it?
  ","
  A three part question. Let's do this justice lol
  
  1. A feeling/emotion whereas alone can mean more literally.. you are alone. Nobody else is near you. You can be alone without the feeling of loneliness as well. You could even feel loneliness in a bad relationship or with a crowd of people if you feel alone in that sense..
  
  2. I'm not sure. I think it helps you know more of what you are looking for and won't settle for less if someone does come around and not up to those standards you've set? Like the person would have to be pretty great if you let them in after so long of being alone. Real connection and all that
  
  3. All of the above given the situation. It can vary.
  "

  I think you'll get wherever you want to be one day. You are very driven. Dreams can also change or take a long time. You seem on the right path already.. just got to keep believing in yourself and the work you do. Keep looking forward.
  
  You shouldn't change for anyone, including jobs. Go with gut instincts. Sometimes walls need to come down too.

  Things I wanted but didn't get:
  
  *Chocolate milk
  
  *Baking chocolate chips (white n dark)
  
  *Pumpkin puree
  
  * pumpkin Quest bars
  
  * = they didn't have/couldn't find it

  However I used almond flour and crushed up pork rinds. Didn't have panko.
  
  350F on the air frier with around 25ish minutes. I originally had 18 minutes but felt it needed a tad longer.
  
  It came out good. Definitely could have used less flour. The recipe called for 2 cups but i only did 1 cup since seemed like a lot already. Maybe should do 1/2 cup if I make it again.

Just really random sh!t like that haha like why is this on my mind? Something going on? Don't understand at all XD I hope everyone still living is ok... wicked strange.
  
  Also I've noticed since talking about my mom's dad on here a bit ago that the wind chime bell thing will go off when I walk past it at times. It won't even be that windy. Definitely noticed times when it was windy but it remained silent. So that's been interesting. Our thing was more money related so why not make money randomly appear? ü§£üíûüòáüí∏

   of course it doesn‚Äôt really effect you in any way. that‚Äôs not how i feel, this feels very personal to me. it‚Äôs so easy to be a white moderate who doesn‚Äôt care and doesn‚Äôt get in other peoples business, and just say we should all get along without race being a factor! lol
  ","
  Totally get that its closer to home for you. I've never been called a white moderate before XD
  
  This made me laugh because it sounded adorable and feisty (the last bit)
  "
495518,"
   i hope you at least understand now that any use of the n-word by a black person is a reclamation of the slur. casually, joking over a game, any time!!! that‚Äôs the whole point of reclamation. white people saying that it sounds stupid or bad feels racist to me.

  It was good :)
  
  A little but I'm a super calm person. I don't know everything. We all make mistakes. Stuff can get heated. Idk. I don't think I was as bad as it seemed either but I do acknowledge how it came across. Also I'm blunt, can't help that all the time, even online. I write a lot too but again, calm as a cucumber. Not a confrontational person either so it felt more like attacking than a legit discussion on the matter.

   how do you think it makes poc who follow you feel to see you referring to this so jokingly and casually, like it‚Äôs ‚Äúcrybaby stuff?‚Äù this is a very genuine question, i‚Äôm not trying to be mean. do you understand that it hurts?
  ","
  Yes, I get that
  
  I'm not the one who wrote the ""cry baby stuff"" either. I understand how it came off and do apologize.
  
  I don't  think I've made any jokes? Maybe poor taste in the way I wrote certain things most of all. I don't always view the whole picture when its certain topics like that. More the here and now, not years ago. Oppression genuinely didn't even come to mind when I read the question. Was more a school setting type thing and the kids at the gym who do say it a lot while playing.
  
  I guess I'm casual because I'm not a fighter. It doesn't really effect me in that way. I've had someone of color turn down a white guy on here and someone kept telling me to stand up for my race because I'm also white. Like no.. talking about men. I don't need to always be in other people's business like that. I guess  i view it that way here too. Everyone should get along without color or words being a factor.

  Nah, we good. It's commonly used for diabetes but I don't have that, its for my pcos. Helps regulate my insulin resistance and whatever else. That's the pill i take daily at breakfast and dinner.

   whats the normal range? i have a low heart rate. im not sure if ive been like that all my life or after i started running. i stopped running years ago but my heart rate has remained low.

  Around 70s but earlier had 68 which was a bit weird then went up..
  
  Also it tracks fat zone, calories burnt etc
  
  That's mostly around 90-100s for me
  
  Not sure what would be considered normal. Probably should see a doctor to get checked or cvs and places usually have those bp machines. Plus depends on age too. Like it compares to other people the same age as well. Lots of information on fitbit app.

   since you stared keeping track of these things have you noticed little interesting things like how your vitals may change? like has your resting heartrate changed from earlier? idk all that gets recoded with these gizmos but thats one that comes to mind.
  ","
  Yes, I have noticed that. It was almost in the normal range categories and then I got sick which made it go down again. Slowly moving back up. I don't always check that part of it.
  
  Also i noticed with the metformin that its at least down by 10 (resting heart rate) than it previously was. I find this part more interesting. They even have a 30 day chart to compare with so that's interesting to see it get better too.

   Would you ever be alright with your child engaging in underage drinking so long as it's in moderation and you're aware of it? For example if you have an older teen attending a party, you can guess they'll be exposed to it but you talk seriously to them and trust them to be safe about it.

  Depends on the age. Rather not have a preteen drinking. 16-18 seems more fair...

  I feel like it should be give and take in both cases. Everyone should feel taken cared of and the role reversed too. I do feel like I have mothery instincts at times but I definitely wouldn't always want to be cared for or care for someone 24/7. You figure both would be adults in this scenario so both should be capable of looking after themselves while still having those moments of care in eachway together. A nice balance. Even just being there says more than all the care in the world.

  ","
  I think people can change and like different things. However, this seems more like a copying strategy but in the end it hurts you more. You obviously care enough about it to ask a question on, clearly whatever you used to like was on your mind. Yes, I think we have some control over it.. out of sight/out of mind as well. I think if someone really missed it then eventually they'd dive back into it little by little. It's not something that would happen overnight. You also shouldn't force it, should happen naturally. With anything time does help. Knowing the reasons behind giving ____ up as well could help in understanding why you don't like whatever you used to.

  just a bit of paraphrasing here....
  
  write a letter explaining how much you appreciate garlic, all the good and not so good times. It will make you happy and the spice happy too. With mindfulness, we can be aware that the garlic is there. We have the garlic to spice things up. Even in times of loss (the micrograms) we can experience gratitude.
  
  ""Waking up this morning, I smile
  
  Twenty-four brand new hours are all for me AND MY GARLIC POWDER
  
  I am determined to EAT them mindfully
  
  and look at all -garlic powders- with compassion and love
  
  for i have failed the micrograms once""
  
  p.s. remember to breathe before and after. it's important for the garlic powder injustice.

  So this is what I've gathered from the book
  
  1. breathe

  aknowledge the parts instead of being the whole. Never use said ingredient again

  I'm Greek, Irish, German and English.
  
  I don't know how far back. I did have someone on the Carpathia. There's a guy on the Mayflower that could have been a relation to my mom's side. The history on my maternal side is iffy. Grandpa didn't talk much about his family. Rumored to have a name change /shortened. He had tons of siblings as did my grandma.
  
  My dad's aunt wrote a history book on lots of people in it. little adverbs of things they did, lived, family members and whatnot. We have it somewhere. It was basically ""fill this out"" and pass on to other members but that didn't happen / don't know who to pass on to..
  
  A lot of them were in German/Australia location wise. Greece as well.. there's actually a hotel/motel with our last name somewhere there so that's interesting. It was also shortened by one letter. Even some pictures of people.. one of them was a twin.

He was all wtf were you watching at dinner and claimed they nailed the awkwardness when I told him what it was about. Some parts were awkward but made it interesting. Would i watch it again? Probably not but it was still enjoyable to watch as well.
  
  3.5/5 perhaps.

   that was a joy to read. i dont think very many take this site seriously. as much as i see people here talk about mental health they fail to realize what a tool they have here. it can be a form of exposure therapy. but you need to take that step. you need to realize opening up here may feel cont...
  ","
  cont.. scary but its a stark comparison to real life. whats the worst that can happen here. some fool says some bs. so what it hurts? deal with it. it will make you stronger. you can block them and you dont have to see their face or be threatened by them. tbh if it was not for you and talking to you recently i was ready to bail from this site again. people are so fickle and wear masks here. they preach how they are but the reality when you pay attention is quite the opposite. from the start you have been 100% real. just tell it like its is. no mask no nothing. so when someone is used to that... to the masked people seeing someone like you for the first time and conversing.. well i expect you are wearing your ""mask"" so if ""this"" is your ""mask"" then the real you is EVEN WORSE lol. but that is where things get tricky. when i find people like you ""real"" people that dont need to pretend to be someone else it can throw me off. i think thats why at first we argued lol. i dont own a mask. and like what you said earlier about people being intimidated by you when you first meet them i think comes down to what im saying here. its a theory at least.

  When Lulu  (dog) had to have emergency surgery. Apparently if a dog doesn't have pups or get sprayed then they could potentially develop bacteria in the ovaries. Puss and all that. I forget the name right now but I think it started with a P. That was scary since she's so small. Only 5 pounds. It was unexpected too.

  They had one of their wedding anniversaries (went to Ireland) and needed someone to watch the dogs last April. Mom and I came out. Expected to just be here for the month. Had really bad blizzards in ME. The house is being worked on.. so it was definitely messy if we did go back.

   i dont know if its possible to ask this without it sounding sexual lol. what sort of meat do you like to eat? like chicken, beef, etc and HOW do you like to have it? like grilled, smoked, fried, cold like in salad? hot? your general account of your meat eating adventures pls lol

  Nah, you did well, grasshopper.
  
  Chicken is great all of those ways. We've even used pork rind crumbs as the coating before which seems weird but is good. You can't taste it but the rub is there. Chicken is my favorite meat.
  
  I feel like with beef, it's usually different cuts of steak or burgers. Grilled or on the oven.
  
  Generally, meat should be hot :p The only one i don't mind cold is chicken salads. Ended up switching to canned salmon instead of tuna
  
  sausage is good too. Don't mind if links or patties.

  lol that was me on Saturday XD I went because I felt i had to and was miserable pretty much the whole time. brother's birthday party. was pretty boring in general especially since the guys all left to play golf and all the females were talking in spanish at the pool.. and the guys got back to the house later on than we did etc
  
  sooo that's another reason why I didn't go to my brother-in-law's brother's house today for a bbq. plus, I thought the gym might be open but nope. Not much for socializing right now, i guess... haven't seen them in a while now. They always end up talking about politics and religion so I'd be bored there too lol today was the right move of not going :D
