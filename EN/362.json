phases, rofl. i went through a goth period where all i wore were fishnet shirts with tank tops and tripp pants. then i had an emo phase with the stereotypical hair-over-the-eyes, rainbow belts, black

vineyards was also a horse ranch, so we got to pet horses, and they also had rose wine slushies.\n  \n  the second day was a spa day, you could choose whatever type of massage or whatever you wanted. i don't remember which one i chose, but nevertheless, i didn't like it, lmaoo. it didn't make me uncomfortable or anything, but it also didn't relax me like spas generally do to a person. i got up from the table in pain.\n  \n  even though i didn't like the spa, spending the two days with my best friend and her other bridesmaid was wonderful.\n  ","389063":"\n  -- it's best to communicate your feelings than remain silent. if you're in a healthy relationship, your partner won't necessarily be offended by your feelings, and instead take the time to understand them and work on helping you

there's no such thing as being \"too picky,\" and the right person will walk into your life eventually (sometimes when you least expect it). don't tolerate ab*se or lying, shifty behavior, or people

responsibility for their own behavior, it's honestly just a bullsh*t way of acknowledging that someone feels a certain way and putting the blame on them, in a sense.\n  \n  if they said \"i'm sorry, i'll work on being better\" and actually changed their behavior, that would be different.\n  ","389106":"\n  sometimes it can be for the validation of others while other times it's because they're sincerely proud of themselves and want to help inspire people. it all depends on the individual.\n  ","389107":"\n  in a sense, yes \u2014 at least most people do. maturity mainly deals with experience and how you've learned from those experiences, and as we get older, we obviously accrue more experiences. however, there are some people who are mature from a younger age because they've dealt with harder experiences than others.\n  ","389108":"\n  not really, no. at the bottom of it, most people are selfish and only care about themselves and what personally affects them, not

again and tell them they haven't changed, and if they continue to ignore you, then you're going to stop talking to them. it's better to be up front with people.\n  ","389111":"\n  i think people have freedom of speech, so they realistically can criticize what they want. however, that doesn't absolve them of responsibility if their words hurt someone.\n  \n  criticizing religion is a bit different from criticizing race, because the latter is obviously racist. organized religion, on the other hand, obviously has its flaws. but as long as you're criticizing the religion itself and not individual people, i don't see the big deal.\n  ","389112":"\n  october-november. i like the crisp chill in the air, the changing colors of the leaves on the trees, halloween time, and just dressing up in cozy

still let it go a few extra days without washing because no one sees me. lmao.\n  ","389123":"\n  i've seen instances where it works and some instances where it doesn't work \u2014 it all depends on

fun.\n  ","389434":"\n  no, i'm not even sure what that is. lol.\n  ","389435":"\n  organized religion is overall bad, in my opinion. i've never been a religious person & most religious people i know seem like they're completely brainwashed by whatever religion they follow.\n  \n  granted there are *some* people who view their religion as merely a facet of their life that gives them meaning, but that's rare these days.\n  ","389436":"\n  literally everything, lmaoo.\n  ","389437":"\n  i'm on askfm to answer questions, not to talk.\n  ","389438":"\n  askfm isn't instagram, lol.\n  ","389439":"\n  my instagram is private & i don't give out my username.\n  ","389440":"\n  the term \"psychopath\" is pretty archaic and isn't used in clinical circles anymore. it increases the stigma associated with mental illnesses.\n  \n  however, depending on the individual, it's usually a combination of genetics and environmental factors.\n  ","389441":"\n  104. i'm obviously a vampire.\n  ","389442":"\n  i believe i did a very long time ago when i was a teenager. since that time, i've only routinely seen two different stylists whom i've trusted. for the past two years or so, i've only been going to one stylist.\n  ","389443":"\n  i'm normally more drawn to bold, outgoing personalities.\n  ","389444":"\n  lol, no. i've heard of the game but i've never played it before.\n  ","389445":"\n  i don't believe i'm much different, except i can express myself better via writing than i can verbally.\n  ","389446":"\n  my week has honestly been terrible, lol. i had a breakdown tuesday night that was a long time coming, probably in relation to the intense therapy session i had the night before. :\/ i ended up clocking out of work early on wednesday because i kept crying and couldn't handle anything.\n  \n  yesterday was a bit better and i got a lot of work done, and today has been good so far. hopefully things look up from here.\n  ","389447":"\n  no, i have no interest in that.\n  ","389448":"\n  yes, i believe in true love.\n  ","389449":"\n  i'm much more active on askfm. i check twitter almost every day, but i don't really tweet very often.\n  ","389450":"\n  good is an average understanding or proficiency in something, while exceptional means that your understanding of something or your ability or do something is above average.\n  ","389451":"\n  i don't know enough about the topic, so i can't give you an answer. you're better off researching the topic yourself.\n  ","389452":"\n  you're better off asking an epidemiologist or doing research on the topic (that doesn't include facebook \"research\").\n  ","389453":"\n  yeah, i've known a few people over the years who have gotten implants.\n  ","389454":"\n  thank you. i've had a pretty good start to the day already (woke up before my alarm and made breakfast & coffee with time to spare). i just have to endure the next eight hours of work before i can relax, lol.\n  ","389455":"\n  working is the most important thing in my life currently.\n  ","389456":"\n  yeah, i'll mumble certain things when i'm alone and i'll laugh out loud to myself.\n  ","389457":"\n  i think it depends on the context, because it could also be a means by which someone shuts down a person who's advancing on them that the person doesn't want to talk to.\n  \n  which, when you think about it, is a bit horrific that people get turned off by self-confidence, or at least a person's ability to recognize that they're attractive. it's almost as if people (men in particular) are attracted to those who are not self-confident or vulnerable, who perhaps are looking for that validation that they're beautiful\/handsome.\n  ","389458":"\n  showers. i absolutely hate taking baths, lol.\n  ","389459":"\n  you evidently didn't read my last response.\n  ","389460":"\n  you're missing the point again. lmao.\n  \n  number one -- if a man \"prefers\" his partner to shave their armpits, that says a lot about them as a person. they should love and accept their partner regardless of their body hair. body hair is natural and superficial.\n  \n  number two -- i'm referring to society as a whole. the media and the beauty\/fashion industries have conditioned us into believing that hairless = beautiful, when that isn't the case whatsoever. historically speaking, the idea of women shaving stems from the fact that men preferred women to be hairless because it represented an adolescent image. now that we're in contemporary times, we've recognized that it's gross and problematic, and therefore, there should be less pressure for women to shave because they're a woman regardless of what hair is on their body.\n  ","389461":"\n  you're missing the point. the fact that men prefer hairless women is what's p*dophilic, because that's the society that influences us, and people can choose whether or not they want to shave. i shave every now and again because it's my own choice.\n  ","389462":"\n  the idea of someone being hairless as s*xually appealing stems from the idea that prepubescent adolescents are more \"attractive\" than adults who grow hair. it's a logical association.\n  ","389463":"\n  unless it's affecting my work, i wouldn't do much about it. people will always like or dislike you, and if someone is immature enough to talk sh*t about you and spreads rumors about you as an adult in the workplace, then that says more about them than about me.\n  \n  if it gets bad enough, i'd talk to my supervisor about it. but this has never happened to me before.\n  ","389464":"\n  cheers !! i'm currently drinking voodoo ranger IPA. :'))\n  ","389465":"\n  hi friends !!\n  \n  ask me questions while i watch some streamers on twitch ~~\n  ","389466":"\n  on my computer screen? that's spotify, lol.\n  ","389467":"\n  i've found it really difficult to answer this question, mainly because i seldom ask people for advice to begin with. and when i do ask people for advice, i honestly rarely take their advice and apply it because i'm too headstrong and prefer to do things my own way.\n  ","389468":"\n  money wouldn't really matter too much to me in such an instance, as much as time would. i would likely try to go visit my best friend who lives in upper new england and spend the day with her and her husband, while we have a campfire outside, get drunk, eat delicious food, and just talk the night away.\n  ","389469":"\n  i would discuss how ableism still exists in society with respect to physical and mental disabilities, and how mental illnesses aren't often taken as seriously as physical illnesses because they're \"invisible\" illnesses. this also applies to chronic illnesses that aren't seen by the eye, such as fibromyalgia, crohn's disease, and other illnesses.\n  ","389470":"\n  i think it would be exciting to be part of the french revolution in the late 1700s.\n  ","389471":"\n  thank you, kittie. :')) your words of encouragement are always appreciated.\n  ","389472":"\n  i've been taught plenty of lessons throughout my life, although most of them were a bit late in life because i was too arrogant or naive to believe otherwise.\n  ","389473":"\n  the value of my own self-worth. i went through more than two decades of my life absolutely hating myself and believing i deserved nothing good, and it's only been recently that i've been learning of my own worth and value.\n  ","389474":"\n  the value of some friendships and certain relationships. you may think you're grateful in the moment, but it isn't until you lose that relationship or friendship that you begin to wonder whether or not you were truly grateful for those moments and experiences -- especially if the person in question died.\n  ","389475":"\n  ableism as it relates to mental health and physical disabilities.\n  ","389476":"\n  you can be confident and self-aware without boasting about it. to be conceited means that you're so full of yourself that you feel the need to express that confidence in exuberance to others, almost to the point where you're seeing yourself as superior to them. regular confidence and self-awareness doesn't give you that pompous attitude.\n  ","389477":"\n  i'm a scorpio, which is a water sign apparently.\n  ","389478":"\n  no thanks, lmaoo.\n  ","389479":"\n  it sounds like fun, so sure.\n  ","389480":"\n  every year has its own ups and downs, and i honestly can't recall what a favorite year would even be. it's definitely not 2020, that's for sure. lmaoo.\n  ","389481":"\n  true crime, writing, literature, mental health advocacy, photography, nature, video games, psychology, sociology, anthropology, animals, etc etc.\n  ","389482":"\n  i'm honestly terrible at cooking, so i'd order something nice (but obviously not pass it off as my own).\n  ","389483":"\n  i don't remember.\n  ","389484":"\n  my depression is causing me to spiral again, lol.\n  ","389485":"\n  i'm talented at writing.\n  ","389486":"\n  video games don't cause violence, no. if someone is already an inherently violent person then they may gravitate towards violent video games, but the video games themselves don't cause the violence.\n  ","389487":"\n  yeah, on more occasions than i'd like to admit, lol.\n  ","389488":"\n  i don't discuss finances on askfm.\n  ","389489":"\n  probably not, tbh. it's my main form of communication with people & i also need the internet for my job.\n  ","389490":"\n  i got it brand new \u2014 the first car i've driven that hasn't been preowned, haha.\n  ","389491":"\n  dark chocolate, it doesn't upset my stomach as much (lol).\n  ","389492":"\n  hershey's cookies & cream.\n  ","389493":"\n  yeah, there are a few people. if i'm bored enough, i'll go on their pages and see if there are any new answers that i might have missed.\n  ","389494":"\n  i've been driving since i was 19. i have a hyundai accent.\n  ","389495":"\n  depends on the area you live in, but as a whole, yes.\n  ","389496":"\n  eggs and fruit.\n  ","389497":"\n  i have a personality disorder, so it can go either way. not that personalities can be inherently masculine or feminine, at any rate.\n  ","389498":"\n  if it's consensual, then there's nothing wrong with it.\n  "}}
