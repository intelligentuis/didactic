use them . . . i choose not too . i have no reason to use them . ouija boards are just . . . the game is just evil . . . i tried to educate people on ouija boards and usually at the end of the lessons

your house they will help you with so much and i m serious . play counselors can help you get out of your house if there s something going on . they will help you get driving lessons they will help you do all kinds of things . if you think that moving out and going with this other person that you re talking about is a good idea then go with it . but you definitely need to get the authorities in it . money and just go to one counselor meeting . get someone to take you and figure out some stuff . don t just get up and go because then you can t get your things . and when you leave you need to explain to your parents the reason why you were going is not because you hate them it is because you were trying to grow up . it s time for you to grow up . some parents tend to be a little overprotective because they want the best for you . they want to protect you because this world is crazy . but you should definitely be able to learn how to drive and get a job at this age . this is the age def to be doing that . . . it is important . . . be careful and don t so anything you regret . definitely go and seek counseling . they can help you out in your sistuation . is the best thing in general atm for you .","48188":"yeah i know that sounds fine and dandy , but honestly you should learn how to drive and then you should definitely get a job and be very into your work and work hard

re establishing relationships with your parents . then maybe down the line and a couple of months or years you can go and move in with that person . but it is extremely important to remain and

you know for sure that you are okay and you can take care of yourself . the reasoning usually why your parents get angry when you are trying to leave is because they care about you and they want to help you . and they see that you aren t ready . use living with your parents as an advantage . get a job and save money . finding a place to rent or put a down payment on house . find you a room mate and rent . if your parents are really strict usually it s because they re trying to help you succeed . there is a small amount of parents that don t give a sh t and are abusive and horrible to their kids . but this is not always the case . respect your parents . keep them on your side . because when sh t hits the fan you re going to need them . your parents are who you want to be close to always . they re going to be the grandparents of your children . they raised you . they gave you so much . though idk your sistuation personally . this is what i hope they have done for you . give them credit . if they even stay in your life and kept you under their roof they did enough for you . some kids growing up don t have parents and die for that type of affection and attention . . . you re going through some stuff in your life . . . try to let your parents know that you want to start over with them and try to make a relationship with them . and if you feel like you are able to take care of yourself then let them know that . but if you are not sure that you can take care of yourself and why not just stay ? just wait . . . you have your whole life ahead of you . try to be young as long as you can because that is a shortest time and your life . . . and when you start to get older you will realize that statement .","48238":"winter and definitely","48239":"my husband . art

want . . . and to . . . lose weight . sometimes it s not always good idea for you to do it yourself , because you could be going at it wrong and that could be the reason why you re getting discouraged . you can ask your doctor for maybe either some weight loss pills ? or to change your diet ? at the same time you need to exercise a lot and a properly . you can also get you a personal trainer or maybe ask your doctor to give you recommendations if they have any ? three you have got to build your self esteem and confidence and believe that you can do it . to lose weight you have to be positive and believe in yourself you cannot be negative . you also have to be patient . losing weight does not take weeks . i don t care what any of those ads online say . . . or any of those youtube videos say . . . losing weight can take them months , to years , but is possible for anyone . but do not procrastinate and not go to the doctor . this is the best way to start your dieting . another thing is do not do it for just the first week and then give up stick at it . make it a new lifestyle . make it a challenge and give up a few things . one year i gave up for a couple months chocolate and soda and then after i just kept going with it . now . . i don t really eat anymore sweets like i used to and i don t drink anymore soda . soda is bad for you . it s okay to have a little bit every now and then but then you become addicted to it . soda hurts your stomach and doesn t have a poistives to it . . . cut is out for awhile . . . you will see that you will feel more energy in your life and that you won t want it anymore . . . just by cutting soda out completely . try homemade lemonade ? or tea maybe ? not huge portions . . no . water needs to be your best friend . try infused water . it is fun and delicious . but honestly i m not a doctor . see your doctor and def .","48290":"say idk ? ask someone else . google . ummmm . . . call a friend .","48291":"i mean . . sure . go ahead

of there significant other because they could had those types of things happen to them . . . yes we chose those difficulties and we accepted the challenge . . . but see my point is . . . people take things for granted , they don t have nothing to show for anything ? they aren t respectful of what they got . they aren t appreciative of what they ve got . they think the wrong things that a relationship revolves around . people have lost hope and long term relationships and marriage . . . loyalty . . . and being faithful to one another . . . people also think that you have to have someone else in your life to live . everyone is so afraid of being alone that they settle for the lowest . you can live alone and by yourself and be independent and happy . you don t need somebody else . i have been single before , single for years and was happy and fine with that . there s no self respect ? there s no morals ? i love being with my husband and i m very appreciative of him and what i ve got . people don t even simply just take a shower ? there s no self respect ? they don t care for themselves so how can they care for somebody else ? they don t go to the doctor ? they don t care about having multiple kids on accident ? they don t care if they catch a disease ? they don t care if they wear nasty , revealing clothes ? and then everybody wonders why there s so much r pe going around ? long story on how i feel on this topic . . . but is the truth on how i feel .","48494":"yes .","48495":"crazy enough . . . i met my husband almost years ago . . . on that game on xbox

still out but it s actually nighttime technically or in other words time to go to sleep and rest . it sometimes being longer days something hours long of light and only a few of night . but when in the winter . . . i mean it gets negative , , with wind chills making it even colder . i mean you have to wear like tons of clothing , masks , gloves , socks and socks , boots and you can t be out too long or you will catch hypothermia in minutes . and then the snow is so piled up in front of the doors and then it s hard to walk through it and then the wind hitting you ? omgosh . . . but the summers are so nice . you really have to learn to adapt when moving to alaska . you have to learn nature tips and survival tips . how to start a fire . learn how to hunt and keep tons , too much in your freezer just in case if you re not able to leave your home for weeks . you have to be careful because there are not many towns and cities and right next to each other . there are towns and cities but not as abundant as other parts of the world and other places . when going through the town and cities unless you live around the stores . . . sometimes they run out of items because there s not as many stores as other places outside of alaska so you maybe limited on supplies . when living really far out in the bush , if you need a hospital , doctor attention you have to ride hours maybe even a
