group chat & immediately my roommate and i express interest. so he's setting the bunny up with a vet appointment with a specialist, and the vet also runs a sanctuary, so the vet will give us the paperwork to adopt the bunny after his check up. he seems like he might have medical issues, but that's perfectly okay.\n  ","377579":"\n  the previous owners names him snickers, but i think we're keeping that name !!\n  ","377580":"\n  this is the bunny we're adopting. :'))\n  ","377581":"\n  not generally.\n  ","377582":"\n  no, i don't flirt in general.\n  ","377583":"\n  it would make me a hypocrite if i turned someone down simply because they cursed.\n  ","377584":"\n  adopting a bunny this saturday.\n  ","377585":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","377586":"\n  because i don't? rofl. i don't need a particular reason.\n  ","377587":"\n  no, i'm just wearing pajama pants and a hoodie.\n  ","377588":"\n  regular food \u2014 i don't like sweets.\n  ","377589":"\n  instagram.\n  ","377590":"\n  i should because i have the tendency to become hypoglycemic, but sometimes i don't eat dinner.\n  ","377591":"\n  stuff related to work.\n  ","377592":"\n  so there's like a 90% chance that my roommates and i are adopting a bunny this weekend. :'))\n  ","377593":"\n  scrambled eggs.\n  ","377594":"\n  i use spotify.\n  ","377595":"\n  neither. i wouldn't want to be famous.\n  ","377596":"\n  better to be safe than sorry.\n  ","377597":"\n  no, just get a test.\n  ","377598":"\n  i'm surviving.\n  ","377599":"\n  i think i am to a certain degree, idk. i've been noticing that i have to use the bathroom after eating\/drinking certain dairy products like 10 minutes after the fact, but it only started happening recently.\n  ","377600":"\n  trolling in general is silly and immature.\n  ","377601":"\n  it doesn't affect me emotionally because 99% of the time, they're from anonymous strangers who have absolutely no idea about my life, what i've been through, etc. in those cases, they're usually projecting their own insecurities onto me, otherwise they wouldn't feel the need to critique a total stranger.\n  ","377602":"\n  tbh i don't like compliments in general, lol. but i do prefer neutral over gendered language more than anything else (sometimes if i'm feeling more masculine then i accept masculine compliments too).\n  ","377603":"\n  pretty sure my friendship with my coworker ended last night over the fact that i didn't respond to her snapchat message. but it is what it is.\n  ","377604":"\n  it isn't dumb at all. ultimately, it comes down to each individual person \u2014 some NB people may prefer more feminine compliments over masculine, or vice versa, or neutral compliments even too. your best bet if you're unsure is to ask them what they prefer prior to complimenting them.\n  ","377605":"\n  braxton helping me calm down today.\n  ","377606":"\n  i wanted to move in with him, but i wouldn't call it desperate. i *was* desperate to move out of my parents' house, though, whether it was with him or someone else.\n  ","377607":"\n  she never responded to me even after i texted her and asked what happened last night. so who knows.\n  \n  i've been an emotional wreck all day (because of that and also other reasons). my mental health hasn't been this out of control in a while.\n  ","377608":"\n  no, that's not really how that works, lol. it happened gradually and we both tried working on it together but it just wasn't there anymore.\n  ","377609":"\n  yes, we had a good relationship. things just dwindled towards the end and the spark just wasn't there anymore.\n  ","377610":"\n  nah, it's been a long time since we broke up. we're still close friends.\n  ","377611":"\n  because i just don't want to? rofl.\n  ","377612":"\n  i have two cats. here's braxton.\n  ","377613":"\n  nothing.\n  ","377614":"\n  well, it isn't that i'm not ready. i'm just not interested.\n  ","377615":"\n  nothing, lol. i'm not interested in dating.\n  ","377616":"\n  9 years.\n  ","377617":"\n  1.5 years.\n  ","377618":"\n  yeah, i'm single.\n  ","377619":"\n  my medication.\n  ","377620":"\n  this was a vibe the other night.\n  ","377621":"\n  no.\n  ","377622":"\n  no, i've never been vegan.\n  ","377623":"\n  not really. i usually check my notifications right before going to bed.\n  ","377624":"\n  video games, music, and writing.\n  ","377625":"\n  milk is disgusting.\n  ","377626":"\n  mentally, pretty sh*tty right now. however, i'm slowly feeling better as the day goes on. it's just one of those weeks where everything terrible seems to pile up on you at once and you're feeling overwhelmed, lost, and panicked.\n  ","377627":"\n  i don't like pineapple, so without.\n  ","377628":"\n  neither.\n  ","377629":"\n  i don't see it remaining in existence in five years from now.\n  ","377630":"\n  i'm currently dealing with this now. i'm just taking each moment as they come, and if they don't want to talk to me anymore -- fine. i did all i could, and it's ultimately up to them if they want to either make or break the friendship.\n  ","377631":"\n  i'm glad it helps you.\n  ","377632":"\n  i'm not getting into that.\n  ","377633":"\n  10 years ago, i was 19. i was in college while partying and drinking and doing drugs every night while maintaining a part-time job, and i honestly have no idea how i dealt with it all. lol.\n  ","377634":"\n  lately i've been binge-watching supernatural.\n  ","377635":"\n  i do sometimes.\n  ","377636":"\n  no.\n  ","377637":"\n  i honestly don't remember, that was like 3-4 years ago. if i did, it was only a small amount.\n  ","377638":"\n  my most painful ones were the ribs, calf, and ankle. my thigh and arm were fine, but even still, it's not as if they're painless.\n  \n  and you're not supposed to take even pain relief pills prior to the appointment because they're blood thinners, which will make it even messier for the artist. same thing with drinking beforehand.\n  ","377639":"\n  no, not really.\n  ","377640":"\n  uh, yeah ... tattoos are painful af, lol.\n  ","377641":"\n  oh, i didn't even think about that. i haven't gotten a new tattoo in like three years. perhaps when you do find a shop\/artist, you should contact them and ask what the best way to tip them would be. if not cash, then probably venmo.\n  ","377642":"\n  this is indeed true. i'll probably pop on supernatural later today just to take my mind off of things. i was thinking of playing video games but i simply don't have the patience or attention span for that rn, lol.\n  ","377643":"\n  i'm still active -- i honestly don't remember much of january, haha. i've honestly just been working a lot, tending to my mental health and going to therapy appointments, etc etc. things have been both up and down, confusing and enlightening, and i'm just trying to stay afloat.\n  ","377644":"\n  around 40 degrees fahrenheit and sunny.\n  ","377645":"\n  6:00pm after i clock out of work.\n  ","377646":"\n  bob's burgers.\n  ","377647":"\n  yeah, i texted my roommate and my best friend about what happened and they both said she was being ridiculous. so at least i know i'm not over-reacting.\n  ","377648":"\n  idk, i've never used either of those before. by \"reviews,\" i meant reviews from friends or on the artist's or shop's social media sites.\n  ","377649":"\n  they're anonymous.\n  ","377650":"\n  (cont) ... Obviously my words won't magically make things better, but I hope it helps to be reminded that you are awesome and bad days don't negate the good days and progress.\n  \n  --\n  \n  thank you -- i genuinely do appreciate this. the stupid thing is, i *know* i'm being super hard on myself but i can't ease myself out of that irrational line of thinking, lol. i've talked to a few people about what my friend said to me prior to her basically cutting contact and they said she was wrong, which is what i thought too, so i'm kinda at the point now where i'm thinking \"whatever happens, happens.\" if she stops being my friend, then so be it.\n  \n  i called out of work today even though i was supposed to attend a small meeting this morning regarding one of my projects. i've always been somewhat insecure about my performance at work and it's taking everything in me to not text my supervisor and ask her how the meeting this morning went, haha.\n  ","377651":"\n  i love my tattoos.\n  ","377652":"\n  instagram, their facebook page, if the artist or shop has a website, etc. i've always found it helpful to make a post (on facebook, as an example) and ask local friends for their recommendations and who to avoid.\n  ","377653":"\n  thank you -- my weight is the least of my concerns at the moment tbh. i've been focusing on my mental health more than anything else because that is what has been declining the most during the past year.\n  ","377654":"\n  very rarely.\n  ","377655":"\n  haha, i guess that's true. a lot of my friends have a lot more than i do, and i also have friends who don't have any at all.\n  ","377656":"\n  i only have seven tattoos, so i wouldn't consider myself a \"veteran,\" but i am experienced with a variety of different artists.\n  ","377657":"\n  i can't even put a number to it, tbh.\n  ","377658":"\n  i'm excited for this upcoming weekend because my roommate's girlfriend is coming over & my roommate decided he's going to smoke with us for the very first time !! :'))\n  ","377659":"\n  i went camping with my friends back in october, which was a lot of fun. we went to northern pennsylvania to one of the camp grounds there and spent two nights there.\n  ","377660":"\n  i don't generally like sports, but i don't mind watching ice hockey games with friends.\n  ","377661":"\n  i've gained a lot of weight over the past 2-3 years, so no.\n  ","377662":"\n  i don't drink milkshakes.\n  ","377663":"\n  i sleep between 6-10 hours per night. i seldom wake up in the middle of the night, especially if i smoke before going to bed.\n  ","377664":"\n  i'm not going to the gym because of COVID, and i lack the motivation to exercise at home because i'm a depressed piece of sh*t.\n  ","377665":"\n  make sure you're going to a reputable artist (sometimes it helps to visit their instagram pages or read reviews online). always pay for the tip in cash because then it goes right into their pockets. don't be afraid to tell the artist that you might need a minute to collect yourself if a certain spot is too painful -- it's okay to take breaks.\n  ","377666":"\n  depends on what you mean by \"active,\" haha. i work during the day, so in that sense, i'm active and productive in a work sense. however, i'm active more on social media at night because i'm not working.\n  ","377667":"\n  i have short-term and long-term memory loss, so no.\n  ","377668":"\n  no, i don't own any apple products.\n  ","377669":"\n  it doesn't phase me either way. half of the time, they're only telling me so that they can ask me to follow them back.\n  ","377670":"\n  it depends on the night. the past few nights, i haven't been falling asleep until 1:00 or 2:00am. other times, i'll go to bed around 10:00pm.\n  ","377671":"\n  a woman with whom i've been friends since we were 11 years old.\n  ","377672":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","377673":"\n  thank you. the past 24 hours have just completely flipped themselves on me. i was doing so well for a long time, and now i feel like everything is crumbling beneath me.\n  ","377674":"\n  hot tea. i only really like hot chocolate when it's very, very cold outside and either raining or snowing. i have to be in a particular mood to drink hot chocolate.\n  ","377675":"\n  hot coffee.\n  ","377676":"\n  i don't believe in karma, but the first segment is accurate.\n  ","377677":"\n  yes, i'm passionate about all forms of art.\n  ","377678":"\n  i don't like cars enough to have a dream car.\n  ","377679":"\n  physically, no. i feel fine right now.\n  \n  mentally, my brain is going haywire and i just want it to shut up.\n  ","377680":"\n  i've been an overachiever for my entire life. i set ridiculously high standards for myself.\n  ","377681":"\n  words of affirmations and quality time together.\n  ","377682":"\n  probably at some point in my life when i was young and stupid.\n  ","377683":"\n  valentine's day means nothing to me.\n  ","377684":"\n  i keep making mistakes at work, a friend with whom i've been close is refusing to talk to me and i'm pretty sure we're not friends anymore, i woke up this morning having a panic attack and worrying my roommates, and i'm just generally in a very bad place right now.\n  ","377685":"\n  it's private.\n  ","377686":"\n  she's actually a coworker of mine. we've been very close for three years now. we haven't hung out because of COVID and stuff, but we talk almost every day.\n  \n  i asked my other friend for his opinion and he said it sounds like she realized she was wrong and didn't want to own up to it, which makes sense but still. she's in her mid-30s. just apologize and we can move on, don't leave group chat and ignore my texts asking if you're okay.\n  ","377687":"\n  maybe i pressed a button, idk. i can't see why else she would leave because it was after she was telling me a bunch of sh*t about how I'm \"too smart and talented to rely on xanax everyday\" and how meds aren't good because you get hooked on them, etc etc. she was essentially invalidating my mental health because i do, in fact, need meds to function daily.\n  \n  she sent like a long paragraph that i just didn't respond to, then i went back into snapchat and her messages were gone and she had left the group. like what.\n  ","377688":"\n  sometimes, but not usually.\n  ","377689":"\n  no, she isn't my roommate. i was talking to my roommate about it though.\n  \n  and no, this is a different friend.\n  ","377690":"\n  i did. it was a bit lackluster, but i enjoyed it anyway.\n  ","377691":"\n  childish gambino.\n  ","377692":"\n  not as fast as i can type on a computer.\n  ","377693":"\n  talking to my friends, playing video games, and watching television.\n  ","377694":"\n  i'd rather wash the dishes.\n  ","377695":"\n  i use instagram, but i don't give out my information for that either.\n  "}}
