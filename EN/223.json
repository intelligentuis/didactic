omniverse s charmcaster returns to a color scheme similar to the original series , while retaining the skirt and some thematic elements from her uaf appearance . her stark white hair is now framed with purple highlights , and like the original series , she has her hair in a ponytail . she wears gothic eye of horus styled eye makeup and golden earrings . charmcaster has developed the ability to merge with her rock monsters to create a secondary armored form , that retains the stone texture and color of her creatures . also , those trivia section factoids feel like they miss the mark like half the time . just because you think something in the show reminds you of something else in pop culture , does not mean that was the creator s intention . the trivia section looks like it s written as if the info comes right from the creators , and it doesn t . if you are going to put those opinions in , at least write them as opinions , not as facts . sometimes it s really outrageous , the things that are considered to be canon or jokes over there . the whole darkstar totem thing is still vaguely annoying . whoever made the judgement call on that thing made a very foolish error . the counterpoint argument was groundless , and absolutely absurd . everyone who works on the ben wiki should be looking at the transformers wiki . tfwiki . net is widely considered to be one of the best fan wikis around . i hope this will be taken only for what it is my personal opinions and constructive criticisms that i am giving because i was asked for them .","206383":"yeah !","206384":"that is mr . pip .","206385":"that is totally not how it started . that is just me picking up dwayne s joke and running with it .","206386":"i has always heard the japanese version was much better . i d still take rid over the unicron trilogy any day though .","206387":"but that wasn t really one on one from what i remember . they have fought together many times , but probably not side by side as starscream likes to hang back a bit and watch for convenient opportunities to take megs out .","206388":"well , i don t believe they are a real wiki , so we re even .","206389":"what new picture ?","206390":"nope .","206391":"we are borg . oh , no , sorry . typo . we are bored . that s better .","206392":"i dunno , megatron just seems to mop the floor with starscream if they ever fight , in any continuity .","206393":"take the elevator to housewares .","206394":"max s cooking , or your face ?
