It shows how you answer a question too! LOL But then they are like... Ohhh idc what people think of me. Okay I'm kinda the same way.. And that's fine and dandy... But really at the end of the day?? It's life. Do what ya gotta right? And just answer the simple question. Why does EVERYTHING have to be a joke?? Life's a joke to them I guess. Mine and the one's around me life's mean something.

We didn't expect that to happen but it did. I don't really want to go into too much detail on that because it is really sad.\n  \n  :KINDA RECENT:\n  \n  Getting married was pretty awesome. Sometimes I still look at him and say hey we're married! Husband! Haha. Could ya believe that?! and it was all the way in September when we got married. Haha. And he looks at me like LOL yeah right????!\n  \n  :RECENT:\n  \n  And then recently one of my good friends committed suicide. He shot himself... No one knew that there was coming? I guess he just wasn't happy? and didn't really want to talk to anyone about? Idk??\n  \n  That was crazy but was something that I had to open my eyes to... the realization in it that he's gone. And that he was 100% fine just the other day. Yea kno?? It's sad. But I'm okay.\n  \n  When Christina Grimmie was murdered down in Orlando at her fan meet-up that was really hard to taken I still mourn today. If you don't know what I'm talkin about you can actually look that incident it up online. It was actually pretty popular incident. It happened around the time that the gay club got shot up in the same area in Orlando Florida. That was reeeally sad too. May God rest their souls. It was alot of people. I think inside and outside the club. Sad...\n  \n  My grandfather passing that was really hard to take in.\n  \n  Alot of sad. Sorry!!\n  ","57737":"\n  No. Because we are constantly running into new people every single day. It's not like you have to announce everything that you've done in your past cuz half the time everyone hasn't even done anything that really bad of stuff to announce. But if you're like a sex offender or something of course with the law you have to... by law* say that you are that until whatever date that you're allowed to not have to say it anymore.\n  \n  Because of course I'm people are wrongly accused and haven't even done the things that they're convicted of. There is some instances where people haven't done the things that they were charged for it and stuff.\n  \n  But like ya know... For example... if you were like 5 years old? and stole a piece of bubblegum from the store and then you're supposed to tell everybody that? No... No.. Or even a candy bar or 2? Anything at that age. Even at 10?\n  \n  Even when you are grown really but with age you should know better but people shouldn't judge you by yesterday. They should judge you by today.\n  \n  Or maybe they beat someone up? Maybe tjey had a reason? Maybe they were protecting? Maybe they were just mad? We all get mad? We all have our moments? I know I do. But control.\n  \n  I have met people that have killed multiple people and they turn their lives around completely. And then I've met some people that have done things similar and they haven't turned their lives around and most of them are in jail and I really haven't met any of those kinds of people because they are where they are. But doesn't mean even that I am gonna judge them even when they are in contempt wrong, because they are in the process of turning their lives around. You never really know the minds of people. Their morals, choice and reason. We don't know?\n  \n  I try to remain open minded with everything. But keep to myself unless needed. Just be careful with what I say and do. Keep others around me safe ya know?\n  \n  I hope that I answered this question right. I hope a little. Haha. ?\u270c\n  ","57738":"\n  Idk.\n  \n  Maybe if someone did something really bad and it was like a law bad type of thing... and if I was to get told and then forced to not say anything and was then threatened that multiple people would come after me if I was to tell peope. Then that kind of secret....\n  \n  That's why it's good to not affiliated with those types of people, situations. That's why it's good to make sure that you don't hang out with influential people, negative people. You want positive environments. Never put yourself into bad matters. Where you have to sell or own people stuff. No. Do not. I don't care if you have to live in a box. You will be happier. I would instead of living life where your constantly havung to hide and run all the time?? Cuz sometimes those types of people will not just hurt you but other people around you and that's when it gets really dangerous..\n  ","57739":"\n  I have had someone try to con me before yes. Many different times especially one situation where a dude walked in the middle of the highway and was knocking on my window and that was probably... Just was really scary. I felt concern for the random stranger because he was just walking in front of traffic in the middle of the highway.\n  \n  But like do you mean kidnapped by one or something?? No. Not by a con man, person, but! I was almost kidnapped when I was 8 years old in the front yard of my grandma's house.\n  \n  I don't care how many people get aggravated of an Amber Alerts... I have experienced almost being kidnapped and if anyone ever gets aggravated Amber Alerts they can shut their butts up because I was almost that kid one time... That was me almost! Taken! Gone! 2 seconds. That's all it takes. And he walked uo in the yard and everything! Was gonna pick me up and take me. I was a smart 8 year old for running. Oh did I run??? I yelled and ran... Scared to death.\n  \n  Anytime I get an amber alert I cry because I just remember that day... and I feel so bad for the kids that are going through that.\n  \n  Also anytime I see an amber alert I tried to look out for the vehicles or whatever it says on the alert and if I see a post on Facebook or on any social media, I share it.\n  \n  Alot of the kids are just people in general!

Feel like that's how relationships should be looked at as a way of being selfless and caring for another individual unlike yourself for once.\n  \n  People are constantly not getting their way in a relationship and so they are hopping from one relationship to another because they think that the relationship is not worth it when really you're not putting in enough time and patience to even try to make the relationship work. If you see that something is clicking with the person then obviously try to make it work don't sit there and pop from one person to another and then when you get to a good guy or girl, do the same thing to them just because you're used to the habit. Don't hurt a person that is seriously looking for another companion's feeling's just because you're wanting to play games and can't figure out what the fks you want?!  it honestly disgusts me.\n  ","57757":"\n  I make extremely lame jokes in from of people purposely and then laughs at them because I feel like that's humorous to people.

When you are not showing any signs of fear which is what negative Spirits feed off of is the weak, if you don't show signs of fear then they will not bother you. They want to manipulate that. They want to be the inferior. If they don't see a chance then they don't usually bother.\n  ","57760":"\n  I would love to go and visit there. I have done so much research on that place. But I have literally been researching the Paranormal for over a decade now.. around about thirteen years. Have been on many adventures and Explorations and I've been countered many different things. I have communicated with the afterlife. I have seen stuff. I have heard things. I've encountered good spirits and I've encountered bad spirits. I've heard doors slam. Have had doors closed on their own. I've heard speaking in footsteps. I have seen things in the corner of my eye. I have seen things get picked up and dropped. and so much more... I respect the history on a lot of things for a reason.\n  \n  And people believe it's all people on drugs and their crazy but no I have prove! And have had people with me that saw and heard and experienced what I was! And the freaking out part does it really affect me.

Spiritual things and missing people get passed on. because I deeply understand it I've researched it for years it's just something really deep that I know about. I mean I usually just sing covers. Like things that other people have written. I don't like a lot of music but if I did that's what I would write about. I like to rap. Like to sing really pretty songs.
