   Is forgiveness important?
  ","
  Yes, I definitely think forgiveness is important. You can definitely forgive but never forget what someone might have done to you because when you forgive your soul feels at peace and you’ll feel so much better and at ease. It’ll be easier to move from that situation when you’re forgive that person silently.  But also some people can take advantage of your forgiveness so don’t give someone too many chances to hurt you. Don’t let anyone get comfortable disrespecting you.

   If the person you're interested in repeatedly showed far less interest in you, and seemed to direct their attention in every other direction, would you keep trying or just give up?
  ","
  Honestly I would say that person isn’t interested in you and they’re showing it to you clearly that they aren’t. They probably have someone else that they might be talking to and or dating that’s why. I would say find someone better and someone who shows their interest in you and gives you attention.

   During WWII 5million women went from working at home cooking, cleaning and raising children to working other jobs. This led to many women across the world taking on jobs and careers more often. If WWII never happened, how do you think that would have affected women wanting to work today?
  ","
  I would I think if WWII never happened women would still want different jobs rather then just working at home, cooking, cleaning and raising their children and there’s nothing wrong with being a stay at home mom at all but I just think even if it never happened that some women would want to experience the world of working and have a job to make income.  It also could’ve effected the fact that since it never happened women would’ve never really had jobs that made an income and they would probably think that  their husband should go and do all that and that it wouldn’t be okay for them to go out and work without their husbands getting mad at them and or being judged.

   You're walking around inside somewhere and you see what appears to be a ghost.... Then one by one your four friends see and hear things too at different times.

  I’d honestly think it’s a real ghost given that I believe in ghosts and in the paranormal world. I believe that supernatural beings are quite real since there are things out there that we can’t explain.

  Oh I think in this case he’s jealous of you and your boyfriend’s relationship and that could be why he turned on you. Another reason could be that he likes you more than a friend and he doesn’t want to say anything obviously because you’re in a relationship with his friend so instead he became cold towards you.

  Honestly you should never pay attention to what someone says about you especially if it’s negative. That only means they’re jealous of you and you shouldn’t take it personally because that only tells you about who they are. I would suggest to ignore it and to remember that they’re just jealous.

   Do you believe in soulmates?
Also do you think that having a soulmate doesn't necessarily mean getting married having kids falling in love but could just be  a naturally strong connection like family?
Do you have a soulmate in your life?
  ","
  I mean I don’t think I necessarily believe in the term soulmates as much as I used to, it’s just the perception that’s printed into our minds that when you find your person like the ‘right one’ you believe that everything will be superb and simple and that’s just not how it works  in reality sadly. There’s going to be a lot of arguing and challenges that come along with your  relationship but all that matters is that you and your partner don’t leave each other just because of an argument but instead grow stronger together.

   [@AthenusVena] Do we people ever really do anything out of our own conscious choice, or are we always controlled by some external stimulation or motive? What do you think?
  ","
  Ooh this is deep, I like it! I believe we do things most of the time on our own conscious because it’s something in our mind and thoughts that might be telling us to do it or even our gut feeling. It’s our inner voice that’s speaking to us very loudly to do that thing but on the other hand, I also feel we are controlled by some external stimulation and motive as well. I feel there’s always a motive behind why someone does something.
