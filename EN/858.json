And so on\n  ","920674":"\n  Basically we feel like the whole thing was rushed and he's taken advantage of dani.  Meaning that dani was in a very vulnerable place a year ago with still going through the heartbreak to finding out who she was. As you know she had a breakdown because the hate becane to much as well. She was starting to get better. Kallen, our childhood bestfriend actually loved dani and that is why he moved and lived with us for a year because he tried chasing after dani. He confessed his feelings for her back home in california for christinas wedding amd for awhile it was always about kallen and them hanging out. And she even wrote as a caption (saying lisa made her) were she was inside kallens tesla, that she was going marry kallen one day and didnt care what any of us had to say. Which dad commented under it \"hey now young lady  with the cool face emoji\". And everything seemed fine. Then around this time is when emmyn was contacting her, blowing up her phone while she was trying to enjoy time with us. Like he was literally being obsessive. And she suddenly started seeing emmyn as well. Kallen moved back to California and really hasnt said much to us since then. That was just the start of it, notice at the reception we did back in Tennessee kallen was by me or arielle the entire time. Kallen also posted that he missed his wifey and someone tagged emmyn in it asking how does he feel about it and emmyn said he does not approve and was upset. Danielle turned 18, and a lot of you know we do EVERYTHING together and always been the closest because sugar & spice and we were like the twins. She moved in with emmyn & his family. You think she would've moved in with me and amy? Because we always shared a room together growing up, it was Lisa, me and her. Then when we moved to Tennessee it was only me and her as the only daughters left in the house. So that's where it kinda seemed weird. Then she like stopped coming around to do family stuff with us or hangout ( we only see her if its like a band meeting, a big function like a birthday or we are on tour now), and that's another weird thing. Because Danielle and I used to hang out all the time and now its just amy and I who lives together and hangs out together (sometimes lisa). Also given her age and seeing how she changed so much (rebellious like) it just seems like its not really going to last.. And its rushed and she's just going with everything emmyn wants because she's afraid to be hurt or whatever again. Or like he wants ties to dani for some reason. And lately it just seems like the Dani we know isn't really there ...\n  ","920675":"\n  I'll explain here in a sec\n  ","920676":"\n  I think we all kinda knew but be reminded we were told next year or next month as well.

But as some of you know a few weeks ago we were doing the golden ticket rewards. Which is were you received a golden ticket with the merch you brought from that time period to be redeemed for a prize. The prizes included: a skype call from one of us, a follow from our band accounts and an exclusive poster. Their was also a glitch in the system and we were behind on shipping things out as well, which our team and us have been working on. Anyway the exclusive poster was given out as a reward to many, which may have not made it so exclusive and fans instantly started to become upset and addressed their concerns... But some addressed their concerns in a way that was very harsh and made fun of the poster and the design claiming it was cheaply made, a waste of money etc. But little did they know the story behind it and just kept putting down the poster. Danielle cimorelli ( our youngest sister) who is only 19. Has became interested in graphic design lately and she's still learning how to do things involving that. We let her do the design of the poster and she thought it would be fun to create a poster out of it and expand her skills as well. Danielle has also done the header and designs for our youtube and our tour announcement, and even helped designed my orange merch as well as emmyns and max's. And I feel incredibly blessed that she has even offered to help with these things. As for a learner I think she does a great job, and her designs are really cute and matches with the aesthetic. However, I know have to deal with a very upset and hurt sister who just wanted to do something for thousands of people to enjoy and have fun creating it as well. ... This is why you must consider what you're about to post! Because we see a lot of those things even if you think we may not. And twitter has always been a toxic place for dani to be on that she stopped coming on completely and had to make a second account. Its sad that our fandom that is suppose to be a positive uplifting community has turned into something wrong don't even associate with. So I ask if you claim to be a fan of ours hut constantly say negative things about any of us, remove yourself from the fandom ... And don't associate with those trying to be positive as well in it.... Im just extremely disappointed and when it comes to.someone I care about like my sister. I feel I have to defend them.

Consisting of things like \"would he date me\" and so on, no he won't because I'm dating his brother, never had romantic feelings for him, and he has his own girlfriend. Stop being those type of people who try to break people up because you're unhappy with your life. Its also annoying how anytime I even mention Tristen you guys like to point out he's gay, I'm better looking. No offense but I think Tristen is adorable, He's good enough for me, and no he's not gay. As for the anons in my inbox telling me to break up with him and date them : NEVER im perfectly content with my relationship and I don't date just anyone. I have to feel comfortable and actually know you for starters. And for the anons who have a weird obsession with jonah marais... That's never going to happen, jonah is the exact boyfriend of one of my sisters and he hurt her pretty badly. Yes he may have grown up, but I will never date him or anything.

This has been the most challenging and hectic month\/2 months of maybe my entire life. It\u2018s like just when you think everything will calm down, there\u2019s something else !!! Did not foresee all of this. Been working with my therapist a lot on using healthy coping strategies to deal with stress and big emotions. Definitely don\u2019t always employ these strategies, but things like being honest with myself, taking time to process my thoughts and feelings (and allowing myself to feel those feelings and have those thoughts), and setting boundaries that I need to keep myself healthy (mentally and physically) even though it might inconvenience other people have been coming in clutch. I think the holidays\/the end of the year is pretty hard for a lot of people. A lot of you guys have your finals for school right now, being around family can be really stressful, or trying to celebrate when you\u2019ve lost a loved one or come from a broken home, or even just having your own personal struggles and not being able to enjoy what\u2019s supposed to be the happiest time of year can be really hard. You\u2019re not alone guys. And you don\u2019t have to pretend like everything\u2019s fine when it\u2019s not. It\u2019s okay to feel exactly however it is that you feel and there\u2019s nothing wrong with you for feeling that way \u2764\ufe0f p.s. the last video is from something really special we filmed ;)\n  ","921128":"\n  I think everyone hates those like lotion and that sets lol\n  ","921129":"\n  I think I can only clearly remember memories from the age 8 and up...
