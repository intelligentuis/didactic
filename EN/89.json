this thread to even show irritation , like it s a subtle thing that just gets under my skin not something i care deeply about . re answering to add i don t mean to come off as defensive or whatever but while i like you fine and i enjoy your questions , i m definitely pretty wary of you considering of my online harassment is done by anons who mention you in some form or another and really , i just don t care to be put on the spot about anything . debate is a manipulation tool . so while i get that this was just a friendly convo about differing opinions on a movie , i feel like somehow ,

different and original but i still felt like mental illness was villainized .","83100":"i just get so tired of mental illness being a vehicle in horror movies .","83101":"spoilers i don t remember the movie very well at this point , but i guess what bugs me is like the movie sets it up to blame the mother for delusional and trauma induced behavior as the culprit for strange happenings but then like , nevermind it s a weird cult afterall so it s almost going to be a blame the mentally ill horror like everyone else does but then they pretend they re above that with the twist ending but they still tried it","83102":"tv labs got it going on","83103":"all that comes to mind is those crime shows that have a computer lab and they enhance teeny little photos to huge sizes without any pixelation or
