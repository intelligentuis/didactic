ill were often seen as \"hysterical\" or \"deranged,\" and would be institutionalized for life instead of being treated as human beings. even though society has progressed a lot since those times, the stigma against mental illness exists to an extent -- especially in terms of more complex disorders, like trauma disorders, dissociation, personality disorders, etc etc.\n  \n  a lot of people refuse to see mental health as a legitimate issue, and they often see it as \"lesser\" than physical health problems because mental illness is an invisible illness. that's why we need to progress more in mental health awareness.\n  ","378811":"\n  i'm honestly not sure -- i'd like to think that my friends see me as a reliable, creative person. as for my family, i've unfortunately always been the

i literally couldn't wait any longer.\n  \n  however, coming from my own personal experiences, even though the jobs i've had in the past were terrible, i still somehow stuck it out until i found a new job before putting my notice in. that alone was enough to kinda \"stabilize\" me a bit more, because if i quit a job without having a backup, then i would probably freak out even more.\n

reminded me of him, etc etc.\n  \n  as for how i'd like to be shown love, i've taken quizzes that said that my primary love language is through words of affirmation. i like being told how much i mean

general and how they're \"cheaper in other stores,\" etc.\n  \n  management was relatively understanding, although my store manager was a mess and constantly expected the most out of everyone to the point where it was unrealistic. after i had put in my two weeks' notice, he called me on my last day of work and asked if i could work a 4-hour shift two weeks from that day even though i wasn't going to be with the company anymore & starting my new job already. he was ridiculous.\n  ","379204":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree with you. i feel privileged to have been able to transition to working from home and keeping my job during the pandemic. so many people i know lost their jobs, got laid off or furloughed, etc etc. it's such a saddening and frustrating thing to see, and also for those people to go through on top of dealing with the pandemic itself.\n  \n  i like my job a lot, even though they had to make certain amends to salaries to remain afloat (they decreased our salaries by 10% across the board :\/). i actually clocked out early at 3:00pm today because i had a huge anxiety attack and could barely breathe, and i'm lucky that i have the proper PTO to be able to do so in the first place.\n  ","379205":"\n  it is -- a lot of people i know work in retail environments and they're given hell on a daily basis by customers who have absolutely no respect or regard for retail

you don't put a mask on, i'm going to ask you to leave.\"\n  \n  cashiers are given a lot of sh*t, especially now more than ever before, and it makes the former retail worker in me happy that cashiers now are advocating for safety and won't back down.\n  ","379210":"\n  i really have no idea how it's produced, lol. i'm not a wine expert. i just prefer white wine over red wine most of the time

\"supernatural.\"\n  \n  i used to be obsessed with the show years ago and watched most of the seasons (i think i made it up to seasons 9 or 10). i made a very close friend here on askfm who shared my obsession with the show, and we talked regularly. after a wild course of events, that person was outed to actually be a terrible, despicable, disgusting human being and i cut them out of my life entirely. blocked them on every social media.\n  \n  for a long time, i couldn't watch supernatural because it reminded me of them. but now a lot of time has passed, and i've been able to watch the

used to be 100% in support of capital punishment when i was younger, and i held that belief for quite a few years. however, over the past maybe ... 2-3 years? ... my stance has changed, and now i disagree with capital punishment.\n  \n  over the course of those years, i've learned the implications of capital punishment and how not only does it mean that perfectly innocent people could be put to d*ath and exonerated after they pass, but it's also inhumane and an archaic means by which to punish someone for a crime.\n  ","379293":"\n  i don't believe they are, no. i watched them both when i

pineapple belongs on pizza or that women should have equal rights as men (just as examples).\n  \n  if someone's opinion is directly discriminating against or oppressing a group of people, such as being sexist or ableist or transphobic or homophobic, then that isn't exactly an \"opinion,\" that's bigotry.\n  ","379295":"\n  it's a tie between \"hard candy\" and \"high tension.\"\n  \n  both are

anxiety when i began working a retail job, but ever since i started working in various office jobs, i've lost that tolerance for talking to strangers, haha. i'm still quite socially anxious, but at least i feel confident in talking to cashiers and whatnot.\n  ","379303":"\n  even though j.k. rowling is a trash excuse of a human being, i do love the character of draco malfoy and have always had a slight obsession with his character (and tom felton too).\n  ","379304":"\n  yes, almost *too* easy, LOL. i can fall asleep to pretty much anything. my roommates always ask me if they're being too loud when they know i'm about to go to bed, and honestly, they could be vacuuming or yelling and it wouldn't bother me whatsoever.\n  ","379305":"\n  i'm not hungry, so i don't feel like eating anything. although i'm debating on either cracking open a beer or pouring myself a cocktail.\n  ","379306":"\n  i dislike the structure of my face with the exception of my cheekbones (which aren't very prominent anymore because i've gained weight). i'd like to have a more defined jawline. i'd like to lose 50-60 pounds. i'd like to stop skin-picking so my arms aren't littered with scabs and scars, and then i can get more tattoos.\n  ","379307":"\n  i quit smoking in 2019 after smoking a pack per day for 10 years. these days, i vape on occasion.\n  ","379308":"\n  when i went on a cruise last february, i rarely ever had service so i went most of the day without using my phone at all besides to take photos. during that time, i'd just walk the cruise ship, sit at the pub, grab something to eat, listen to live music, etc etc.\n  ","379309":"\n  i used to write in a journal as part of my therapy sessions, but i haven't done it in months. i never really got into a solid routine with it.\n  ","379310":"\n  i just say \"thank you,\" although it really depends on what they're complimenting me on and how appropriate or inappropriate it is.\n  ","379311":"\n  yes, i absolutely love musicals. some of my favorites are RENT, les miserables (although i've never seen it live), sweeney todd: the demon barber of fleet street, the rocky horror picture show, and memphis.\n  ","379312":"\n  the house that i live in, specifically the relaxing environment of my bedroom when i have my ambient lights on and i'm sitting in bed watching television.\n  ","379313":"\n  no, none of my IRL friends or family use askfm (to my knowledge). although i can say that\n  \n   @CourtneyUwU\n  \n  is an IRL friend of mine since we did meet on two occasions. :'))\n  ","379314":"\n  i try my best to relax on the weekends, so that mainly entails sleeping in as long as possible, listening to music (especially if i'm doing laundry or cleaning), watching television and\/or movies, perusing social media on my laptop, and playing video games.\n  ","379315":"\n  yes, i have two cats named teddy and braxton. braxton is a smaller gray & white cat who's very timid and doesn't know how to meow, and teddy is a black & white mainecoon who has separation anxiety.\n  ","379316":"\n  both, to some extent. i try to save as much money as i can, but occasionally i do splurge on things such as food.\n  ","379317":"\n  i prefer lightly sweetened iced black tea. when it comes to hot tea, i don't sweeten it at all.\n  ","379318":"\n  they're old songs that sailors and pirates would sing on their voyages, derived from the 18th century, where they would harmonize with one another and seldom used actual instruments.\n  \n  lately, tiktok has popularized sea shanties since people have been posting videos of them covering old sea shanties, and they've become sorta the \"new\" trend there, ahah.\n  ","379319":"\n  my roommate. my asked me how i was doing\/feeling since my mental state has been a bit weird lately, so i thanked him for asking.\n  ","379320":"\n  i started reading \"fahrenheit 451\" by ray bradbury months ago, but i never finished it.\n  ","379321":"\n  my friends' support in my life, having a stable job throughout this pandemic, having a house to live in independently away from my parents, and caffeine.\n  ","379322":"\n  sea shanties, ahah.\n  ","379323":"\n  my happiness levels (or lack thereof) don't depend upon my belief in free will. i do believe in free will as opposed to destiny\/fate, and i believe that everyone has the capability of making their own choices which can affect themselves and others in life, but it's pretty disconnected from whether or not i'm happy.\n  ","379324":"\n  legally-speaking, a teenager becomes a legal adult when they turn 18 years old (at least in the united states).\n  \n  however, being a mature adult is a lot more complex than simply an age. i know plenty of people who are over the age of 18 and don't act like adults, they still behave like children. when a person is over 18 years old and begins to learn how to take on responsibilities, tries to be independent (as much as their mental\/physical state allows), and cultivates a strong, concrete persona -- that all leads to a more \"adult\" mindset.\n  ","379325":"\n  arrogance, most definitely. i cannot stand anyone who has an arrogant personality, both in a friendship and relationship context.\n  ","379326":"\n  my best friend is one of the strongest people i know (emotionally and spiritually speaking). she's endured a lot of hardship throughout her life, and she honestly has the worst of luck especially when it comes to medical things, but she's always kept a good head on her shoulders. she's the type of person to keep moving forward despite what comes against her, and despite everything that has come in her path, she has managed to find love, get married, and is in the process of buying a house.\n  \n  i'm so incredibly proud of her. she's a true warrior.\n  ","379327":"\n  listen to music, watch television, and play video games (either solo or with my friends).\n  ","379328":"\n  yes -- there will always be facts that are indisputable. just because people debate about them doesn't mean that those facts are any less accurate.\n  ","379329":"\n  probably caffeine, tbh. :\/\n  ","379330":"\n  i prefer penne pasta, and i'm not the biggest fan of bowties.\n  ","379331":"\n  i'm not a big fan of cauliflower as-is, but mashed cauliflower is good.\n  ","379332":"\n  no, i don't. i'm sure i've had some bad experiences at hair salons, but i don't recall any of them.\n  ","379333":"\n  my day has been good. work was fairly slow, so i'm grateful that i wasn't stressed out about anything today (which is nice from the norm). i cleaned the house a little bit on my breaks, and now i'm answering questions from my laptop\/cleaning up my inbox while listening to sea shanties. :'))\n  ","379334":"\n  no, you weren't being unfair at all. it's sh*tty to begin with for your friend to talk about your mutual friend behind their back to begin with, especially knowing that this mutual friend is more your friend than their friend.\n  \n  i think you did the right thing. nobody is obligated to like anyone else, of course, but your friend probably shouldn't have told you these things in the first place.\n  ","379335":"\n  iced coffee, iced tea, margaritas, and beer.\n  ","379336":"\n  my current job isn't a *perfect* job for me, but nevertheless, i do enjoy it a lot. i'm a writer and editor for a publishing company, so i spend a lot of time writing, reading, copyediting, etc etc.\n  ","379337":"\n  i don't like sports, so i don't have a favorite. however, i do enjoy camping ... which probably isn't considered a \"sporting\" activity, but it's the only thing i can think of, haha.\n  ","379338":"\n  yeah, my favorite animals are wolves.\n  ","379339":"\n  i waited until he completely left, as in already driven down the block, before grabbing my food. LOL.\n  \n  jesus. why am i like this.\n  ","379340":"\n  oh god, i think the grubhub driver who's dropping off my dinner is the same guy who also got my dunkin this morning.\n  \n  send help. i'm too awkward for this.\n  ","379341":"\n  bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches, sometimes with cheese and avocado.\n  ","379342":"\n  sure, who doesn't?\n  ","379343":"\n  sitting on the couch with my legs extended, a blanket covering me, a glass of wine in my hand, and watching a show or documentary on my laptop in a dimly lit room. :'))\n  ","379344":"\n  i mean, the 2000s is when i really started getting deeply involved in music, so it's impossible for me to pick one favorite song.\n  ","379345":"\n  my brain likes it, but my body doesn't. lmao.\n  ","379346":"\n  idk, probably take them to a vet to make sure they're healthy and then get the vet's advice as to where to take them, like a shelter or something. as much as i want another pet, we can't take any in right now.\n  ","379347":"\n  my life used to be fun when i was in my early 20s, haha. these days, i'm pretty much consumed by work and have zero energy to do much else (not that i can due to the pandemic anyway).\n  ","379348":"\n  no  i barely have a lifestyle to begin with, haha. all i do is work, do household duties, hang out with my roommates, play video games, and watch television.\n  ","379349":"\n  eating dinner, drinking, and watching the new documentary on netflix about richard ramirez.\n  ","379350":"\n  aw, thank you !!\n  ","379351":"\n  nah, at least not completely. i like shaving half of my head and i also have an undercut on the other side.\n  ","379352":"\n  i'd love to meet ;\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n\n  \u2013\n  \n   @ManicMartyrdom\n  \n\n

i've never really noticed. it really depends on the day and the lighting. they're also greener when i cry, lol.\n  ","379355":"\n  hazel\/green.\n  ","379356":"\n  nah, i have an xbox one.\n

but also haven't really done research into it because they're not parents or anything. i've only learned about the harmful effects of it through other parents i know through social media.\n  ","379360":"\n  this handsome boi. \ud83e\udd70\n  ","379361":"\n  on the rare occasion, yes.\n  ","379362":"\n  when i was much younger, i think i did. however, never as an adult.\n  ","379363":"\n

","379366":"\n  yeah, particularly shrimp, crab, and salmon.\n  ","379367":"\n  hot chocolate.\n  ","379368":"\n  my day has been fine so far. i'm currently on my lunch break (only 4.5 more hours of work to go). i've also really been wanting to vacuum and clean, but my roommate is still asleep. :\/\n  ","379369":"\n  i'll file this under \"things i really didn't need to know.\"\n  ","379370":"\n  i'm against circumcision. it isn't medically necessary in a large majority of cases, and circumcision leads to a greater rate of problems either as an infant or later in life.\n  ","379371":"\n  not at all, haha.\n  ","379372":"\n  they're basically the same, but PTO is ideally reserved for any scheduled time off or sick pay, and vacation time is used for extended periods of time.\n  ","379373":"\n  my skin is flourishing.\n  ","379374":"\n  i have one day's worth of PTO and a week's worth of vacation time.\n  ","379375":"\n  i'm a writer and editor for a publishing company, so it requires a lot of critical thinking, reading\/copyediting, and focus.\n  ","379376":"\n  yeah, most mental illnesses that are comorbid with depression make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for people to perform their daily tasks. when i'm entering a depressive state, i literally cannot get out of bed, i don't eat or drink, and i can't even focus on media like shows or movies. for me to try to work in that capacity is impossible.\n  ","379377":"\n  no. most people with mental illness, when their illnesses are acting up, literally don't have the energy or motivation to just \"get up\" and \"get moving.\" it isn't that simple, especially for people such as myself who have had chronic mental illness for years\/decades.\n  \n  if it was that easy, then depression wouldn't be as prevalent as it is today.\n  ","379378":"\n  abandonment & enclosed spaces.\n  ","379379":"\n  english grammar and literature.\n  ","379380":"\n  well, i struggle with mental health issues so there will be days in the future where i'll need to use that PTO to take time off. i'm feeling mentally well today, so i don't want to waste those hours when they could be better spent when i'm unwell.\n  ","379381":"\n  i've only ever had stouffer's frozen meals, but they're good (for frozen food at least, lol).\n  ","379382":"\n  drink, watch television, listen to music, etc etc.\n  ","379383":"\n  i mean, i could always fake a migraine but i don't want to do that & waste my PTO, lol.\n  ","379384":"\n  no, haha. i honestly don't know anyone who does that.\n  ","379385":"\n  i'm not currently religious or spiritual, so no. however, when i was younger, i was very interested in eastern spirituality and religions (i.e. taoism).\n  ","379386":"\n  people have the freedom to express themselves however they want, within reason of course, and if someone wants to talk about their personal business, then that is their decision. it's up to the rest of us to decide if we feel like reading and\/or listening.\n  ","379387":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm doing well. it's a very slow day at work and i'm pretty much just trying to space out my tasks to last me the entire day instead of going at my usual pace, sigh. i wish i could just take the afternoon off, but i have no valid reason.\n  ","379388":"\n  my roommate bought a burrito blanket the other day, and it's so f*cking cozy. i also splurged on new clothing a few weeks ago & i have a bunch of new supernatural merch, lmaoo.\n  ","379389":"\n  i made an appointment to color my hair bright blue next month, so at the moment, i would choose blue.\n  ","379390":"\n  that was happening to me a few weeks ago, but now things seem to be caught up on my end. however, shoutouts that i've sent weeks\/months ago are being sent out again, which is super aggravating.\n  ","379391":"\n  yeah, crying is pretty much my default reaction to any strong emotion, haha.\n  ","379392":"\n  i don't ever wear gloves.\n  ","379393":"\n  i much prefer the mountains. i've lived near beaches my entire life, and the mountains are a great escape from the regular scenery.\n  ","379394":"\n  no, they're not. my mother doesn't vote to my knowledge, but my father is left-leaning and voted for biden this year.\n  ","379395":"\n  i'm left-handed.\n  ","379396":"\n  i haven't weighed myself in nearly two years, and i intend on keeping that number unknown to me.\n  ","379397":"\n  well, good thing we live in entirely different states.

but sometimes i do skip meals and only have one or two per day.\n  ","379421":"\n  i haven't been in school in over seven years, lol.\n  ","379422":"\n  i like giving presents over receiving them. i like seeing the looks on my friends' faces when they see what i've given them, especially if i think it's something they'll love.\n  ","379423":"\n  yes, most definitely. i'd want to know so that i could avoid doing that behavior in the future.\n  ","379424":"\n  i'd rather live without a washing machine. luckily, there's a laundromat not too far from where i live.\n  ","379425":"\n  i've barely

in high government positions are like in their 70s to 80s, and they're making decisions for the country where most of the demographic isn't them anymore. times have changed & that makes me believe that things will get better as the boomers fade out and real progress can be made.\n  ","379430":"\n  not really, no. i used to years ago but now they just increase my anxiety & make me feel super

doctors' schedule as to where people are in line in terms of when they're getting the vaccine.\n  ","379441":"\n  people have been getting vaccinated for weeks now in new york. i have friends who are health care workers who have received their vaccines. but i'm lower on the list than most others because i'm young with no concerning health conditions (i.e. being immunocompromised) and a job away from the public since i'm not an essential worker, so i'm not a priority.\n  ","379442":"\n  texas hold 'em, mainly. i also like cards against humanity if that counts, haha.\n  ","379443":"\n  because

askfm or instagram, haha.\n  \n  askfm ; i like answering questions most of all, as well as getting to know the people i follow whom i consider to be friends. asking others questions is fun as well.\n  \n  instagram ; i like scrolling through my feed and seeing the pictures my friends post, especially if they're animals, lol. i also tend to add to my instagram story rather frequently.\n  ","379696":"\n  i've been all right. today is my last day of quarantine, so i can finally go out and run the errands i need to run. i woke up at 6:00am and heard my roommates talking, and when i talked to them, they said that neither of them went to bed last night because they couldn't sleep, lmaoo.\n  \n  so now i'm eating breakfast and drinking coffee, and i'm going to the drug store to pick up some items later.\n  ","379697":"\n  i have two roommates.\n  ","379698":"\n  no, those people were simply protesting and not storming the united states capitol.\n  ","379699":"\n  it took me several years (as in, like ... from when i was a pre-teen to my early 20s) to realize that my intense mood swings, depressive episodes, and mania were definitely not normal and were indicative of mental illness.\n  ","379700":"\n  no, i used to do it when i lived with my parents. but now that i live on my own, i have no reason to keep snacks in my room.\n  ","379701":"\n  black craft cult and torrid.\n  ","379702":"\n  uh, probably caffeine. :\/\n  ","379703":"\n  well, i have a bottle of water in my room at all times. but i wouldn't consider that to be food, lol. all of the food in my house is in the kitchen.\n  ","379704":"\n  no, i don't.\n  ","379705":"\n  i've always wanted to sneak a photo of one of my cats while he's sitting down with his paws crossed and then put that \"ah, what a distinguished gentleman\" sound over it as a tiktok, lmaoo.\n  ","379706":"\n  success shouldn't be measured by how much money you have, or if you're married or single, or if you have children or not. on the other hand, i think success should be measured by how happy you are with yourself and your life despite those standards.\n  ","379707":"\n  i think it ultimately depends on the person -- sometimes they really do affect a person's confidence levels, knowing they look more attractive using filters and if they begin to feel extra bad about how they actually look.\n  \n  however, i think for most people, it's just a way of expressing themselves and to have a bit of fun. for example, i know that snapchat filters thin out my face and make my facial structure more prominent (and smooths my skin, of course). i like using those filters because they do make me feel better about myself, but i'm also aware that it isn't what i *actually* look like and it doesn't affect my view of myself at all.\n  ","379708":"\n  i was alive during the 1990s, but i wish i was older (whether a teenager or young adult) during those times so i could experience the music scene and the overall culture of the 90s.\n  ","379709":"\n  in 2020, i learned that i needed to gain more patience and also focus more on my mental health instead of working myself to the bone. i've learned to not blame myself or be too hard on myself if i need a mental health day away from work.\n  ","379710":"\n  the familiarity of it all and the fear of change, most likely. which is very common -- you're not the only person who experiences this.\n  ","379711":"\n  my entire life is one awkward mess, so probably anything that i've said. lmaoo.\n  ","379712":"\n  haha !! that's really cute, actually. i've also seen my friends do like ... high fives, but with their feet. lmao.\n  ","379713":"\n  yes, particularly video games. they've always been a source of comfort and escapism for me even when i was very young.\n  ","379714":"\n  that's definitely true -- i honestly would never do that in a million years, COVID or not, haha. hell, i even hate shaking hands with people.\n  ","379715":"\n  yeah, but usually it was only loose singles, haha.\n  ","379716":"\n  i'm the same way as you -- i'm not a touchy person either, i absolutely *hate* being touched and sometimes i don't even like being hugged by my friends. it was different when i was in a relationship, of course, but in terms of my platonic relationships, i'm not a hugger or anything else.\n  ","379717":"\n  \"if you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n  ","379718":"\n  at the same time, however, greeting friends and family with kissing them (such as on the cheeks) is normalized in other cultures. i'm not sure if that's what the anon was implying, though.\n  ","379719":"\n  i would rather be respected as opposed to liked. you can dislike someone, but still respect them. i don't care if people dislike me or not, but respect is very important to me.\n  ","379720":"\n  i wouldn't be surprised if i did, lmao.\n  ","379721":"\n  i can't really say much without being labeled as a hypocrite because i did hook up with someone during the summer, haha. i probably shouldn't have done it, but it is what it is.\n  ","379722":"\n  i can't narrow it down to just one because i love so many different kinds of music. i like alternative rock, nu-metal, classical music, gaming\/television\/movie soundtracks, hip hop, some pop music, metal, etc etc.\n  ","379723":"\n  considering we're in the middle of a pandemic, i'd rather stay home. although tbh, because of the fact that i've been home for so long, i don't really have much of a desire to go out and do things anymore.\n  ","379724":"\n  probably my belief that there are more than two genders, and that gender pretty much exists on a spectrum as opposed to having a definitive number.\n  ","379725":"\n  i'll honestly be surprised if askfm is still around in four years, tbh.\n  ","379726":"\n  i say \"hi.\"\n  ","379727":"\n  i've never used either.\n  ","379728":"\n  no, i don't. well, besides her \u2014 but that was a different situation, rofl.\n  ","379729":"\n  obviously i'm not going to satisfy your desire, so you might as well just leave.\n  \n  in the meantime, i suggest you talk to someone. i'm concerned for your health.\n  ","379730":"\n  yes, i drink.\n  ","379731":"\n  okay, i'm being completely direct and serious here -- are you okay? this is like the third or fourth time you've reiterated this question word-for-word, and i'm concerned for your mental health.\n  ","379732":"\n  this a whole level of obsession that i've honestly never seen before, hot damn. thanks for letting me know your intentions, though. :'))\n  ","379733":"\n  you sound like a broken record. are you okay?\n  ","379734":"\n  sounds good to me.\n  ","379735":"\n  i can't predict what i will or won't remember in four years from now. you're reaching, my dude.\n  ","379736":"\n  i don't tend to use emojis anyway even when i am on my phone. i'm just not an emoji sort of person, haha.\n  ","379737":"\n  confide in someone who's close to you so that you don't feel alone in your struggles, and if possible, talk to someone like a teacher or a counselor so that you have a support system.\n  \n  i would also say to stand up against the bully and stand your ground, but sometimes that may make the situation worse instead of better. it all depends on the situation.\n  ","379738":"\n  does alcohol count? haha.\n  ","379739":"\n  i don't believe i have, no.\n  ","379740":"\n  mostly, yes. i find it easier to answer questions when i'm typing on my laptop as opposed to typing on my phone.\n  ","379741":"\n  honestly, yeah. i would probably remember the overall idea of it, but not any details.\n  ","379742":"\n  yes, it has happened to me in the past. fortunately, i'm not in that environment anymore.\n  ","379743":"\n  yes, i have an HP laptop.\n  ","379744":"\n  i only really enjoy attention from my friends, haha.\n  ","379745":"\n  i've traveled very briefly. the most i've traveled was when i went on a cruise to the bahamas in february of 2020. prior to that, i've also been to upstate new york and most states in new england.\n  ","379746":"\n  why is sketchy in quotation marks? lmaoo.\n  \n  i have memory loss. if you've been following me for a while, you'd know that.\n  ","379747":"\n  i downloaded a meditation app on my phone a few days ago to help ease my anxiety.\n  ","379748":"\n  bills and food.\n  ","379749":"\n  the woman i hooked up with last summer, rofl.\n  ","379750":"\n  my only good habits are getting up around the same time every morning and drinking water.\n  ","379751":"\n  not everything is subjective, no. scientific facts and evidence, for example, are not subjective.\n  ","379752":"\n  no, that doesn't help someone to educate themselves at all. in those types of cases, if you're shaming or being rude to someone, then they're more likely to be resistant to becoming more educated on a subject.\n  ","379753":"\n  i'm polite until given a reason not to be.\n  ","379754":"\n  yes, i love mushrooms.\n  ","379755":"\n  i don't think it's a mistake or really wrong to express your vulnerabilities, as long as you're comfortable doing so. in that regard, if someone tries to leverage those vulnerabilites in an effort to hurt you, because you were comfortable expressing them to begin with, it likely won't hurt you either way because you posted them on social media for a reason.\n  ","379756":"\n  you're anonymous and a complete stranger. your insistence that you're right means nothing to me.\n  ","379757":"\n  i'm not sorry because she had it coming to her in participating in what can be seen as as a domestic terrorist event.\n  ","379758":"\n  amazon and etsy, at least when it comes to gifts for the holidays and my friends' birthdays.\n  ","379759":"\n  i think this anon is insinuating that obama should have been banned from social media as well ?? i honestly have no idea, but this conversation is amusing me either way while i wait for my grubhub delivery. lmaoo.\n  ","379760":"\n  i'm planning on doing laundry and cleaning the bathroom, but other than that, i have no other plans.\n  ","379761":"\n  you gave me rudimentary information in two sentences and because you are biased, i'm not inclined to blindly believe you. i would have to conduct more research.\n  ","379762":"\n  ginger peach green tea.\n  ","379763":"\n  nah, i have no interest in love or relationships right now.\n  ","379764":"\n  lately i've been binge-watching supernatural, which has been very entertaining. i forgot how much i loved that show.\n  ","379765":"\n  i'm 29 years old.\n  ","379766":"\n  educate myself further on the subject if i'm interested enough in it and if i have the spare time to do so.\n  ","379767":"\n  i have a collection of mugs and wine glasses, but i don't intentionally collect them. lol.\n  ","379768":"\n  i already answered this question above.\n  ","379769":"\n  because they benefit from that privilege and often claim they they themselves are \"oppressed\" because they've perhaps experienced discrimination once or twice in their lives. they're disillusioned of what oppression and privilege actually is.\n  ","379770":"\n  i'm drinking coffee now, since coffee often constitutes as a meal in my life. lmaoo.\n  ","379771":"\n  around 8:00am, but this morning i woke up at 6:00am.\n  ","379772":"\n  friends. i absolutely cannot stand the show.\n  ","379773":"\n  i don't remember much about obama's administration, but either way, obama wasn't making dangerous and reckless remarks on social media regarding the incident, from my understanding.\n  ","379774":"\n  e x a c t l y.\n  \n  honestly, if he makes another twitter page, i'm going to laugh hysterically.\n  ","379775":"\n  you just sound salty that your beloved trump got banned from twitter and other social media because of his reckless and dangerous behavior.\n  ","379776":"\n  oh, most definitely. lol.\n  \n  especially because they're claiming that trump's \"freedom\" or other people's freedoms are being stripped from them solely because social media platforms and other corporations are banning people for perfectly valid reasons. smh.\n  ","379777":"\n  yeah, i've been driving since i was 19 years old.\n  ","379778":"\n  i watched the first half of lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring the other night. :'))\n  \n  yes -- the LOTR trilogy is one of my favorite movie series.\n  ","379779":"\n  i'm currently #38 in the united states.\n  ","379780":"\n  it isn't against the law, lmaoo.\n  ","379781":"\n  twitter is very much a corporation in itself with its own standards, rules, and guidelines. it's. a social media platform, yes, but it isn't diminishing his \"right to free speech\" when his speech is literally encouraging violence.\n  ","379782":"\n  i love rainy days.\n  ","379783":"\n  it's funny how trump was all about corporate freedom until he was banned from twitter for the corporation exercising it's freedom.\n  ","379784":"\n  he's the president \u2014 which means he should be more cognizant of what he posts because he has a bigger platform than pretty much everyone else who uses twitter. to take advantage of his authority to post messages that are dangerous and inciting violence is irresponsible and reckless, and also goes again twitter's guidelines.\n  ","379785":"\n  the best way for me to wake up from a nap was the news that trump was banned from twitter. \ud83e\udd70\n  \n  what a time to be alive.\n  ","379786":"\n  i'm sure they have been.\n  ","379787":"\n  rain & clouds, most definitely.\n  ","379788":"\n  broccoli and cheddar soup.\n  ","379789":"\n  breakfast this morning.\n  ","379790":"\n  blankets & hoodies.\n  ","379791":"\n  nope, not by any means.\n  ","379792":"\n  nope, i'm incredibly proud of twitter for finally making the executive decision to remove trump from the platform.\n  \n  trump is not above anyone else, and everyone on social media must follows the terms & conditions. his most recent tweets were inciting violence among his supporters, which is so dangerous. apparently his supporters are planning another storm upon the capitol on the 17th.\n  ","379793":"\n  i just woke up from a nap.\n  ","379794":"\n  yeah, although it's only been a week.\n  ","379795":"\n  ideally, all lives should matter but the fact is, not everyone is treated equally \u2014 especially the black community. that's why i'm for the black lives matter movement.\n  ","379796":"\n  i only draw once every few months. they're usually some sort of abstract thing or eyes\/faces.\n  ","379797":"\n  ugh, absolutely nothing. i don't even eat dessert foods to begin with & i can't handle sweet foods in the morning.\n  ","379798":"\n  nah, not really.\n  ","379799":"\n  burger king, if i had to choose between the two of them.\n  ","379800":"\n  thank you ~~\n  \n  i'm trying the best i can to stay safe & healthy, especially considering my roommate has COVID (although he officially tested positive a week ago). hopefully it's starting to get out of his system, although he's very concerned that his taste & smell will never come back. :\/\n  ","379801":"\n  not really, no. it hurts my bank account, lol.\n  ","379802":"\n  i prefer apple pie.\n  ","379803":"\n  i don't believe so, no.\n  ","379804":"\n  yes to both !! i want to eventually get a record player for the vinyls i have.\n  ","379805":"\n  i don't chew gum, so idk.\n  ","379806":"\n  cashier at a drug store.\n  ","379807":"\n  right now, it's this one from last night ~~\n  ","379808":"\n  i have an instagram account, but my account is private.\n  ","379809":"\n  i do, yes.\n  ","379810":"\n  yeah, although that's no different than the usual. i don't take public transportation anyway.\n  ","379811":"\n  nope.\n  ","379812":"\n  LOL, common mistake. i has to double check & make sure i didn't write that too.\n  ","379813":"\n  birch trees.\n  ","379814":"\n  yes, i took one last week.\n  ","379815":"\n  northern pennsylvania for a camping trip last october.\n  ","379816":"\n  on several occasions, yeah.\n  ","379817":"\n  get off my lawn ~~\n  ","379818":"\n  yes, thankfully i never stopped working.\n  ","379819":"\n  lately i've been playing skyrim and assassin's creed valhalla. i also enjoy the fallout and bioshock series, minecraft, destiny 2, and the witcher 3.\n  ","379820":"\n  nope, it hasn't snowed since early december.\n  ","379821":"\n  not usually, no. i've only ever cried in front of my ex.\n  ","379822":"\n  hello \u2014 do you have a question?\n  ","379823":"\n  nah, i'm good.\n  ","379824":"\n  i'm very much at peace rn \u2014 i'm drinking, watching one of my favorite shows, i feel clean and relaxed, and i have a candle lit. :'))\n  ","379825":"\n  the last person i talked to was my roommate, if she counts. otherwise, it was the doctor at urgent care last week.\n  ","379826":"\n  yeah, considering it just ended, i decided i wanted to watch it again from beginning to end.\n  ","379827":"\n  watching television, playing video games, perusing social media, etc. i've also tried getting into the habit of watching people stream on twitch.\n  ","379828":"\n  i'm currently on season five, episode three. however, years ago i think i made it to seasons 7-8, because i remember other characters that haven't appeared yet.\n  ","379829":"\n  it's nearly 1:00am and i'm wide f*cking awake and slightly manic and watching supernatural.\n  \n  ask me questions, i guess?\n  ","379830":"\n  askfm is a question & answer app where you ask and answer questions, follow people who you may see as interesting or funny, and just overall have a good time \u2014 just don't be a d*ck.\n  ","379831":"\n  nah, not awkward at all. i've simply never been described as that before.\n  ","379832":"\n
