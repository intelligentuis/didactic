   Guess what!  Last night daddy let me dance around in my nighty and then he slowly undressed me and lay me onto the bed before he had his way with me very gently.

   Classical conditioning is a process where two stimuli are repeatedly paired. For example: in schools, when the bell rings, students immediately know that it’s time to go onto the next class without question. Don’t think I explained it well enough. Just look up Ivan Pavlov’s classical conditioning
