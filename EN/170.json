is wise or not to ride your horse bareback . your own riding skill level are you balanced correctly and can you remain balanced through any unexpected movements ? are you effective in your legs , hands , seat , and voice or do you get nervous easily and shut down ? are your muscles strong enough to remain engaged but not grip the horse for extended periods of time ? . is your horse used to the sensation of riding tackless ? have you ever tried it before ? the feeling of a rider with a saddle is different than the feeling of a rider without one and may be somewhat confusing for some horses the first time it s introduced . what is your horse s demeanor calm or prone to spooks ? will riding bareback be a safe option for you based on this and your ability to cope ? . what is the status of your horses back health ? are they well muscled and in shape , bony and elderly , or sway backed ? being able to support your weight over a strong and capable set of latissimus dorsi muscles is important . riding bareback is not as comfortable for either of you if your horse has a weak or bony back if you meet all these conditions , riding bareback is not harmful or unwise and can be quite fun and freeing for both horse and rider !","157310":"old town road is a stupid ass song about cheating on your girlfriend and doing drugs set to an upbeat rhythm so people like it anyways , but it

so intoxicated . alternatively he could mean until he s too tired , but forreal it doesn t take that long for a rider to get tired when even just walking around on the horse . your seat gets sore

in public , liscenced veterinarians dr . natalie marks and dr . keri bayley both advised against the practice . they both agreed that there is not enough air circulation nor room in masks for pets to breathe properly because of the shape of their noses and faces , unlike people . because pets cannot contract or spread the disease , the point is mute anyways . the veterinarians also stated that masking pets also restricts their access to water , which can be dangerous , as pets including horses , cannot tell us when they re thirsty , and dehydration could lead to severe health risks . if you

affection than this , but here are a few i noticed coming up to see you when you re walking in the field without being asked called , keeping their ears and eyes turned toward you a lot when you re with them , acting relaxed and maintaining a soft facial expression when you re with them , following you around , blowing into your face and smelling your nose it s the horse version of a handshake or waving hello to someone , nickering or whinnying at you when you come up to them , and willingly following your directions ! those are all telltale signs that your horse likes you , trusts you lots , and considers you as a friend and leadership figure","157896":"xxx s at the end of stuff is for signifying kisses to someone right ? i thought you just said you had a gf lol","157897":"oh haha no i

idrc","157926":"used to be much more so when i was younger but now i m a little more involved . not quite a social butterfly , but not quite a wallflower","157927":"bright rooms because i need to see the sun in order to help me wake up on a normal sleep schedule . otherwise i ll sleep all day and not even realize lol . plus rooms that are brightly lit by the sun make me happy ! natural light is the best","157928":"kinda . the lobes of a horse s liver are similar to humans except for horses have a bile duct that empties directly into the first part of their small intestine instead of having a gall bladder like people . your gallbladder helps you to break down fatty foods like meat , especially red meat . that s part of the reason why horses can t eat a lot of meat without getting sick","157929":"a mare is a female horse . a foal is a general term for a baby horse of either gender . if you want to be specific about a foal s gender , you call a female foal a filly and a male a colt","157930":"basements bc they re underground and can be wet and cold . attics aren t usually very wet and cold in my experience","157931":"some are and some aren t , just like people ! i once knew a mare who was so afraid of snakes she d spook and bolt away from anything that even resembled a snake at all . once she almost threw me off while i was riding her around in the outdoor ring bc she saw the garden hose near the fence and thought it was a snake","157932":"no . horses are obligate herbivores , meaning they re unable to process large amounts of any kind of meat . horse s livers are not equipped to deal with or flush out any sort of meat proteins , so featuring meat as a regular part of a horses diet would cause them to get sick","157933":"correct","157934":"showers !","157935":"i don t like pork","157936":"i don t know enough about you or that situation to pass judgement or comment on that , nor do i want to . good luck to you","157937":"ricotta stuffed pasta shells","157938":"how sandy facetimes me every morning to show me how the horse is doing while i m not there , drinking warm coffee or tea , playing with my dog , and doing art !","157939":"i don t think i have one","157940":"country or indie !","157941":"a collective years off and on .","157942":"all my old t shirts and stuff with holes in them . i m too sentimental","157943":"i don t really remember many of my birthdays cause for a while i didn t really celebrate them and then before that i was super little . i d have to say probably my st since it s such a big celebration for most people","157944":"eh idk lol . probably yes","157945":"sandy says a wolf ! for me , i wouldn t wanna come face to face with a tiger","157946":"hmmm i don t really watch a lot of tv tbh . maybe sandy from spongebob ?","157947":"i haven t watched an anime in a long time . the last one i watched and like though was boku no hero","157948":"a lot of the concepts transfer over quite well . both horses and dogs are pretty intelligent creatures that require social companionship to survive and need someone to look to as their trusted leader figure . one aspect of horses that is very different from dogs though is that they re fight or flight prey animals , where as dogs are predatory pack animals . people are also predatory pack animals , so when training a horse you need to think about how your training requests are portrayed in their eyes and adjust your behavior so they don t get too overwhelmed or afraid . it s sort of hard to explain in a concise way lol .","157949":"oooooh haha i was confused i have no preference . i ve spent a good deal of time in covered rings stadiums but also a lot just being outdoors or in outdoor rings . i ve competed at events held in both spaces and it doesn t really matter to me","157950":"not sure what an indoor equestrian would do lol . horses don t really fit indoors what do you mean with this q ? i m curious","157951":"yeah to all of those things except i don t currently own a snake lol","157952":"i m ready for the next step","157953":"of course no problem ! horse riding is my passion so i m always excited to share it with people about the horse racing though , i m actually not a fan of it at all . there are a lot of questionable and , in my opinion , quite cruel things that happen behind the scenes at a lot of race tracks that i fervently disagree with . even when owners try to treat their race horses fairly , the actual act of running races at such a high speeds for such a distance is extremely tough on a horse s body and has a lot of detrimental effects a lot of what happens to horses as a result of the racing industry is just awful so i don t support it .","157954":"i don t even know what he looks like lol but he s super old now isn t he ?","157955":"dude you couldn t possibly annoy me with horse questions ! keep em coming for as long as you want ! ! i could talk about horses for hours and hours , i m such a horse geek . to talk about equestrian stuff is the reason i initially created this account ! i just want people to ask me about horse stuff and like literally nothing else p","157956":"made of brick , up on a hill , surrounded on both sides by trees with a clearing at the bottom of the hill overlooking the fields and equestrian facility . the riding arena would be in full view of my kitchen window ! it d have a moss garden with a pergola covered in passion flowers and morning glories and have plenty of shade . inside it d have a master bedroom with a bathroom attached that had a big bathtub and a shower with all those crazy sprayers from all angles so it d be like you were standing in a rainstorm when you took a shower ! it d have an open kitchen and living room floor plan with a gas fireplace and a finished basement area built into the hill with a wood burning heater to warm the house in extra cold months","157957":"nice ! that s horse country for sure ! lots of equestrian events take place there from what i ve heard . my friends went to pony club finals a few years ago in kentucky ! i didn t go cause i couldn t afford it but they said it was super fun","157958":"i have an idea i guess","157959":"it depends on the reason you want them for , like what job are they gonna do ? each breed is more uniquely suited to different kinds of riding styles and or jobs for example warmbloods usually excel in things like eventing and at hunt seat riding , while quarter horses tend to really shine in the reining and western pleasure rings . shetland ponies do well in lead line level classes and as pasture pals , while percherons stand out in driving and farm work roles . it all just depends lol","157960":"blue boyyyy","157961":"i m a pisces","157962":"within yourself . you have to decide yourself that you re a worthwhile human being","157963":"idk you or your general life or financial or mental health situation . that s not my place to comment on that and it s none of my business","157964":"he doesn t need toooo much grain , especially in the summertime since he has constant access to grass . but he gets a scoop of senior sweet feed mix every day plus his hoof growth supplement . he had very cracked hooves for a second because of the dry heat and stomping bugs away , but the ferrier s workplus his new supplement seemed to have fixed the problem almost entirely now","157965":"anons been rude today forreal ! lmao","157966":"haha you d like to see me get upset at all your random rude remarks wouldn t you","157967":"long boring lectures with monotone speakers lol . especially about math !","157968":"pick your battles wisely . don t make a mountain out of a mole hill ! know when you re wrong and learn to admit it out loud ! know how to learn from your mistakes and learn from other s mistakes . always be humble and kind .","157969":"you should totally see what s up with it ! after you learn to relax your nerves and your body and get proper balance , everything else follows naturally ! can t remember if i already said this or not but every barn i ve ever attended took riding lessons at i ve found online . just google riding facilities in your area to get started ! i started off riding english style but later on took some lessons riding western style too . in my opinion english style riding is more fun because you can eventually learn to jump with the horse , but western riding is equally fun if you re just learning to ride on the flat walk , trot , canter , gallop w no jumping . riding lessons in my area usually go for about for each one hour session . you show up with jeans and shoes with a low heel like cowboy boots , not high heels lol and they ll provide the horse and equipment ! make sure you get yourself a good horse riding helmet ! some places will provide you with one but it s always much safer to have one you know fits your head well . plus then you don t have to share nasty sweat germs with people . you ll use muscles you didn t even know you had lol its a great way to social distance , stay in shape , get outdoors , and be around nature !","157970":"i don t feel safe meeting up with people who i ve spoken with online . def not posting my location on here lol . waaay too many creeps","157971":"it s an iphone so its alright i guess idk lol","157972":"in the afternoon","157973":"yes , with restrictions on what websites they can use , similarly to what kind of website blocks are already used by school systems . being able to keep in contact with the outside world would be extremely beneficial for inmates who are serving long sentences . it would allow inmates to take online classes , study new information , keep up with family more easily , and allow them to better themselves in order to be a more productive and marketable citizen when they get released instead of feeling overwhelmed and having no skills when they re released , leading them to go back to illegal activity as their only means of survival . it could essentially help break the cycle !","157974":"i have no idea who you are","157975":"my heart fell in love first and my brain told me no lol","157976":"sandy says cezious maximus after my dog lmao","157977":"continue life as usual . get a higher paying job , move out of my current living situation , accrue wealth for a bit , and move out west with sandman if i can .","157978":"no , while that s a humane and kind method of training too , i prefer to train not based off of food reward , but release of pressure . anything can be considered pressure such as clucking , speaking a command word phrase like walk on , tapping or poking gently with your hand or the crop , your aids while riding , etc . basically , gentleness and persistently asking the horse to do something in baby steps and increments is my favorite method . as soon as the horse even begins to start doing what i m asking them , even if it s not perfect or it s just a step in the right direction , i stop asking and let them think about it . then when they start to lick chew and look at me again i begin asking them to repeat the motion . that way they associate release of pressure aka i ll stop bugging them as its own reward !","157979":"when speaking to someone in person who i m pretty good friends with , yeah i tend too be a bit sarcastic . over the internet where everything is mostly text based i try not to use sarcasm though because it doesn t translate as well","157980":"yeah , seemed like useful info to know for filling out forms and stuff","157981":"by ignoring it and hoping it goes away","157982":"totally ! i wish i could live in germany or maybe finland since it s been named the happiest country on earth years running now lol","157983":"and you wonder why nobody wants to date your crusty , misogynistic , lazy , rude , no life skills , having ass","157984":"don t care it s not in my future plans but it doesn t affect me in any way what other people choose to do with their love lives so it doesn t matter to me","157985":"in creativity in soft skills in looks at horse riding in motivation in empathy","157986":"lmao no that s not my style","157987":"i wouldn t say it s good for them but it s not poisonous to them . horses are such large , heavy , animals that it would take an enormous amount of beer to get them drunk , which would be both expensive af and cruel , so i m sure nobody would reverb want to attempt to do that to them . lots of horses i ve encountered have liked the taste of beer though !","157988":"late middle school early high school","157989":"nah subscribe to me on youtube if you wanna see more stuff from me https m . youtube . com user fwfgirls","157990":"my advice google this . i m not google","157991":"if you want to get outside and learn something that will take up as much of your time as video games used to , then get into equestrian sports ! once you learn basic balance , stopping moving forward , and steering , there are lots of different routes activities you can choose from with horseback riding","157992":"i m not interested in you . also , if that s the only thing you re looking for in a woman , you should just hire a cleaning service and order groceries online instead so you can continue to be a lazy piece of shit without having to drag your partner down with you .","157993":"i d talk to you , get to know you , and crack some jokes along the way .","157994":"no , horses should especially not eat potatoes . potatoes are a member of the nightshade family , a family of plants that are very toxic to horses . sadly , they can t enjoy the beautiful gift that is french fries","157995":"you re an asshole then idk what to tell ya","157996":"the short answer is no kinda . unprocessed or very finely ground corn can give a horse colic which can result in death . eating too much corn cal also cause problems for a horse s feet like laminitis or founder . you d have to buy corn that s been specially processed to be able to be fed to horses . horses wouldn t do well eating normal cow or chicken feed that s heavily corn based","157997":"yeah i guess . this is more of a statement with a rhetorical question . not sure what you want me to say to this haha","157998":"someone already asked me this yesterday . long answer short the dogs don t get many table scraps , but when they do it s only things i know it s safe for them to eat and they only get small quantities as a treat","157999":"that s a dick move , which would make me feel uncomfortable and guilty . i don t enjoy being rude to people and i don t enjoy calling attention to myself . i just want to be nice to everyone and go about my day in peace","158000":"yeah i guess . i usually just say i don t know and they call on someone else . it s not really a big deal","158001":"umm okay . . . ? seems like a few conflicting emotions there . hope you re able to sort that out lol","158002":"no , i didn t like speaking in class in general so i just kinda kept my head down and did the work so i could go back to sleep or doodle lol","158003":"i gotta wash out the big pieces of leftover food from the dishes and wash it down the garbage disposal otherwise it clogs up the dishwasher","158004":"hugh jackman","158005":"i m cold , lemme put on clothes","158006":"no i don t want any sort of

really care lol . i get a million lewd messages here a day tho so i feel like i have some clue","158010":"don t know what that stands for exactly but i m pretty sure it s keeping up with the kardashians ? ive never watched it . a lifestyle focused so heavily on material objects , outward appearances , and flashing your money has always been cringey and kinda disgusting to me . i m not a

year","158028":"no haha my parents are supportive , but they re definitely not horse people dad can t be bothered and mom is too nervous . but thanks , man i can t wait to do that in the next chapter of my life","158029":"none at the moment . horse ownership isn t a financial possibility for me atm","158030":"horse stuff , food , and dog stuff lol","158031":"locksley ! i don t ride at that barn

couldn t tell you exactly what it pays to work in the field though cause it really depends on what you re doing . grooms get paid far less than farriers , vets get paid more , big name trainers can make a whole living off of their reputation alone , and some people like me just do catch rides for people who need them to give their horse some exercise for free , ya know , so like it all just depends on what you re doing and your qualifications schooling profession .","158057":"this in in our study office room . it used to hang in my room when i was little because my parents said it

lol","158065":"here you go anon . out of the goodness of my heart , i m willing to overlook the passive aggressive , uncalled for , antagonistic , and negative message you sent in that last question in order to better explain the language i used a little further up this thread since you seemed to be very confused based on your response . please take the time to read these peer reviewed scientific articles based on medical data before continuing to spout off at the mouth and attack others over things you clearly have done no research on and have no understanding of . these are not from any kind of news sources or celebrity instagram stories as you ve previously suggested . so much misinformation is out there ! i truly hope you can begin to sort through what is fact and what is a

choose to read any of this , which i don t think you will tbh , at least know the info is out there . something tells me it s much easier for you to continue on living in your own reality and continue to be a naysayer because doing nothing and sticking to what you know is always much easier than trying to learn new things . good luck to you , have an excellent day , and be aware that i will not be replying to this thread any further as i ve communicated everything i feel i wanted to say in this post .","158066":"i m not here to argue with you over what heaps of scientific data , clinical testing , medical knowledge , and common sense have already proven . believe whatever you want , in the end we all know you just want to feel like you re right . i hope you have a nice day . please remove yourself from my page .","158067":"i went to the lake house with sandman ! !","158068":"pretty strong in the long run . i know my worth .","158069":"idk man . some people just like feeling superior to others it s a personality disorder","158070":"nope","158071":"a normal person whom everyone loves","158072":"being a good sport even when you lose , knowing how to act when you win , and keeping yourself motivated to do even better next time no matter if you won or lost , are all valuable life skills i think some people were never taught or exposed to for sure","158073":"no that s fuckin dumb i literally hate kids , i never want them , id be miserable as fuck , it s derail my entire life plans , and i d get stuck caring for someone i don t have the financial or emotional means to . plus reality tv like that is trashy and scripted anyways so they could make me say and do whatever i wanted for television ratings and that would stay out there forever . doesn t seem worth it in any aspect .","158074":"technically , yeah it s bullying . but on the real , this may be a hot take , but hear this people can benefit from things like schoolyard pick if they use it as motivation to better themselves instead of internalizing it in a negative way and taking out their frustrations on others . you the slowest runner in the schoolyard ? suck at dodgeball ? practice and learn to get better ! it will help you make yourself into a more well prepared , well rounded human . kids nowadays , myself included , were taught that everyone s a winner and that we re all equal but then get into the workforce and realize that feeling entitled to win or to get picked won t work anymore bc as adults nobody gives a shit if your feelings are hurt that you didn t get picked and nobody gets participation trophies . people end up getting frustrated because things are different than they were taught .","158075":"an insincere apology is a waste of breath","158076":"with , then i got more

necessary to euthanize any animal unless their quality of life has diminished and they are no longer able to live a happy , healthy , life . if you and your veterinarian discuss and decide that your elderly horse has a very poor quality of life as a result from the side effects of aging or any other health issue that cannot be resolved , then that s when they would need to be humanely euthanized .","158080":"you re right , it s technically completely within your rights to show your complete disregard for the safety of your community , your friends , your family , and your country . congratulations , you ve made us have to wear masks even longer now","158081":"my friend olivia","158082":"horses generally live into their s , so a great indicator that they re getting old will be the condition of their teeth ! generally , with normal wear and tear , a natural , vertical , mark line called the galvayne s groove will appear on the horse s rd incisor tooth sprouting from the gum line down beginning when they are about years old . when they are , this mark will extend all the way down the tooth . that s a great indicator that your horse may be getting old . many old horses also show signs of aging just like people do such as getting droopier skin , slowing down , losing muscle mass , decreased sight abilities , swayed back , losing a bit of hair , looking bonier , and getting grey hairs !","158083":"an ollie oldie but goody","158084":"laundry","158085":"no . betrayal implies willful and premeditated deceit . i haven t ever betrayed a friend like
