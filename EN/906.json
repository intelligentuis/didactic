just aren t used to sharing how they feel with someone else .","838282":"i would say both to be honest","838283":"oh lol i was confused !","838284":"i probably would tbh","838285":"i believe it s more important to feel loved definitely ! because when you feel that you are loved you are motivated to do things and get things done and that makes you feel extremely happy knowing that people love you .","838286":"well i know which one of my memories are real because i experienced them and went through them emotionally and physically you know ? like i know what is real and what isn t

their camera s away . if people wanted to post our wedding pictures they could .","838305":"snapchat !","838306":"i d rather go to a music festival have fun and sleep in a tent ! that sounds so much

a sweetheart and just super amazing and truly one of a kind .","838310":"if i was his age and went to high school with chester i think i would ve connected with him and his music would also have been compatible with me .","838311":"edraegen","838312":"maybe bashful tbh","838313":"we re not engaged yet","838314":"oh goodness ! i guess with my worst enemy so we can try and work things out .

!","838321":"i would keep this one , instagram and snapchat !","838322":"edraegen and the others i m not sure","838323":"i m absolutely aware , yes .","838324":"absolutely i have because of my anxiety sadly","838325":"that s a great question ! we judge ourselves by our intentions because we know what we are going to plan or aim and then we judge others by their actions because we don t think like them and we may get confused by their actions and not understand them .","838326":"edraegen can braid my hair","838327":"edraegen","838328":"i personally do !","838329":"just waking up and you

holding me close","838344":"that s sweet anon !","838345":"i do !","838346":"no i will . it s a fact .","838347":"thank you !","838348":"yes , i ve heard it many times before","838349":"no it s going to happen","838350":"i m not sure","838351":"oh goodness here we go","838352":"no no , i m going to marry him","838353":"i m not hungry lol","838354":"oh goodness gracious","838355":"no i don t

sometimes i keep it to myself and bottle it up","838360":"i like both but i like boba more !","838361":"my personality","838362":"oh goodness that s so sweet","838363":"i will not","838364":"it s

you more than you love me and awhhhh that s so sweet ! you re truly one of a kind and i ve never met anyone like you ever !","838371":"i do , indeed","838372":"yes including eyes !","838373":"because a virtual world sounds so much better than the real world . and in the real world people don t tend to love themselves because they don t have confidence and are insecure about their looks and that s completely understandable because people like to judge others looks so quickly without even knowing the person and it s just sad but they still do .","838374":"when it s all said and done i believe i would have said more than actually doing anything .","838375":"yes , of course ! it s possible with your body language","838376":"because people didn t care or appreciate them when they were alive and living and when they pass people feel guilty and start caring and appreciating them only when it s too late .","838377":"fish and many others","838378":"that s so sweet , i m also in love with you","838379":"i wish i could change my social anxiety tbh","838380":"that s okay , you don t have to !","838381":"oh goodness that s difficult ! maybe salad , chicken , and definitely chocolate !","838382":"well i personally find criticism more motivating because you re proving them wrong and getting it done !","838383":"well through my airpods i can actually hear my own breathing it s so weird lol","838384":"the subject english tbh !","838385":"i would say kill people tbh","838386":"well that s true !","838387":"i definitely do !","838388":"i ve seen many weird things in my life lol","838389":"i do !","838390":"lol none actually","838391":"i don t","838392":"i don t !","838393":"it annoys me actually lol . i don t like it","838394":"not too long i always find the time to sleep","838395":"it s a flower sweater lol","838396":"i m not crying ?","838397":"no you re not !","838398":"oh don t even say that though but that s extremely adorable","838399":"oh my goodness this is adorable","838400":"not really","838401":"it s still going !","838402":"oh yes , i definitely would but let s not get into that","838403":"i know you want to ! awhhhh i know you would how about you choose a day ?","838404":"i definitely don t !","838405":"edraegen","838406":"edraegen are we ?","838407":"i feel like people respect the dead more than the living because they feel they didn t show that they cared or respected them when they were alive . they feel now that they re dead we should care more and have more respect for them so that they don t haunt us and come after us . if we show that we loved them and now care about them it will make us look like we are good people . and that s extremely saddening . you should show how much you appreciate and love someone while they re alive so when they pass they would pass away knowing that you cared , loved , and appreciated them . but i noticed people start to care about someone after they re dead like that s just messed up and depressing to know . like with chester bennington i noticed that people started caring about him and listening to his music more after he passed because they felt guilty that they didn t while he was alive . and that just pisses me off so much how someone can say oh yeah i ve been a fan of linkin park for so long and i ve been listening to chester ever since when really they haven t . they just say that because he you know and that makes me so extremely mad .","838408":"how s that cute ? lol","838409":"i can t","838410":"hurricane by thirty seconds to mars !","838411":"good morning !","838412":"i try to work hard on things all the time and when i do i absolutely love it","838413":"i do not !","838414":"i believe it s better to have loved and lost rather than to have not loved at all . i think it s good to experience love at least once or a few times in your life .","838415":"you re so kind , thank you !","838416":"i mean to be human means that you have to try and live your life to the fullest and go after your dreams and passions in life . and to always try and stay positive and happy in life no matter how hard it gets . and to always spend time with your loved ones !","838417":"no , i don t find it hard switching from one language to another although sometimes it does happen","838418":"i don t , lol","838419":"omg this is the most cutest thing ever ! awhhhh you re so sweet wow","838420":"goodnight y all !","838421":"next to edraegen in his arms","838422":"no i wouldn t actually .","838423":"okay okay , you re the cutest it s official","838424":"that s cute !

singing voice !","838429":"i m sleepy rn so i can t think of anyone","838430":"i don t think so tbh but you never know","838431":"i do i do","838432":"i don t play that","838433":"i ve heard many wise things in my life though","838434":"the first one","838435":"oh goodness maybe !","838436":"i think you can see the color change and it ll look like it s expired and it would taste sour and old .","838437":"no i do not like the vegetable","838438":"well i would see what they re lacking definitely and how different their heart is from mine . like the complete opposite","838439":"hmm , i can t remember","838440":"i think with vip you get more benefits and have to do more things","838441":"i feel like sometimes i let others make them for me but then i also make my own decisions","838442":"just chilling currently","838443":"uno definitely","838444":"in my cooking class i had to record a video of me cooking lol","838445":"you ve taught me what true love is too i can never thank you enough for that .","838446":"i do actually !","838447":"nope , never !","838448":"that s so adorable ! omg i love you","838449":"oh no , we are spending our lives together .","838450":"no it wouldn t be me . it would definitely have missing opponents .","838451":"well i m taken so i d kindly tell them that i am","838452":"it would be more worse without them tbh","838453":"that s extremely true awhhh","838454":"i have , in pe !","838455":"that s so sweet . thank you for being you","838456":"i definitely answer more than i ask i feel like lol","838457":"how it s so fast moving and how you have to pay attention to it every step of the way . and how to live your life to the fullest and go after the things that you want . and to appreciate the people in your life and show them that you love them .","838458":"edraegen","838459":"i think my things own me tbh","838460":"well i mean dark chocolate is considered healthy i mean any chocolate is considered healthy so i guess so tbh","838461":"i think technology is definitely controlling us tbh . in this generation especially it s controlling us all and mostly in a negative way .","838462":"i try to ask more questions absolutely !","838463":"nah , i already have a life","838464":"honestly i don t know tbh","838465":"honestly i don t think i would . i would miss my family and friends and my love edraegen and my life on this planet .","838466":"oh goodness i love both !","838467":"nope lol","838468":"i d probably laugh lol","838469":"i don t know why lol","838470":"i don t know , i rarely get sick tbh","838471":"no i haven t","838472":"that s great !","838473":"i don t know tbh","838474":"happiness is st , health would come second , love would come third , money forth and fame fifth .","838475":"i just go to bed when i m really tired tbh","838476":"i m doing alright ! how are you ? thanks for checking in ! you re also awesome","838477":"oh yes ! especially in math class lol","838478":"did you ? lol","838479":"i did , yes !","838480":"linkin park always does !","838481":"not necessarily","838482":"it s clear since you can see your reflection through it lol","838483":"that s so adorable lol ! thanks anon","838484":"yes , i believe i have when i was little !","838485":"good question ! i think i learned how strong i am emotionally and that s because of my past that i am now emotionally stronger .","838486":"honestly i think some people are able to get more things done only because they don t procrastinate and they re motivated to get whatever they need to get done . they put all their time and effort into getting things done and aren t lazy . and that is why some people are able to get more things done within hours .","838487":"no no no , i would want my kids to follow any dreams that they have !","838488":"firstly i would want my kinds definitely to be happy and to follow their passion and dreams but happiness comes first !","838489":"lol don t worry i did","838490":"spread positivity and love everywhere you go ! the world needs more of it rather than hating on each other and spreading negativity !","838491":"honestly i feel many things would get better if humans focused on what was going rather than what s going wrong . we always tend to focus on what s going wrong and that is why we are always so stressed out and frustrated . but i also think that we re just so used to focusing on what s going wrong so we just go along with it .","838492":"i do not !","838493":"i have not","838494":"the egg came before the chicken . . it was laid by a bird that was not a chicken","838495":"no i don t because they add stretchy cheese to it and i do not like stretchy cheese at all !","838496":"goodness i m

that comes along with it and go through it with your partner only to become strong as a couple . and it means you re in a relationship with that person and not seeing other people because you re giving them all of your heart and everything .","838628":"well i think i m just going to lay back and chill today","838629":"oh no that would be so devastating to find out the child wasn t mine but no
