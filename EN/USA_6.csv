  Just give them a second and let them vent and cry and just be there with them. Understand or at least try to. Sit there and continue to listen and be company and let them vent more. Tried to calm them down then when they start to talk to you more and then try to be out of the ordinary and utterly awkward funny and try to just cheer them up. Depending on the person of course. Some people just don't want to be talked to you at all and it's better just to sit there and let them vent. And some people you just have to leave them alone

  Here's some notes.
  
   But honestly use this and look them up yourself.
   
   He wants to do all the seasoning first with a little olive oil or butter and a little bitty bit of water not a lot and let it cook down for about 30 minutes and stir it continuously.
   
   Pre cook the chicken so it's faster or maybe you can get a rotisserie chicken and pull it apart. Make big pieces and little pieces.
   
   Adding chicken broth can help to the food. Don't ask too much. But just enough. Chicken broth about three cup. If you use chicken bouillon cubes about 3.
   
   Always add okra to the soup. Crush up about half of them in the soup and let it get sick. That's how it gumbo becomes thick.
   
   And then of course don't forget sides. You want to make the entree interesting with a few sides to make the meal even better. Make your own homemade potato salad or just a regular salad and then maybe get you a French bread roll or some rolls and prepare them on the side or maybe cookies and croissants or biscuits. Good luck

  I would love to have an under pool. A huge underground pool with a few diving boards and a rock climbing staircase. A few slides. 1 small one kinda small but real steep. And then a large and twisted fun slide.
  
  Then have a incline starting at a few inches and then the pool goes to almost 15 ft deep.
  
  Have a couple racing lanes.
  
  Tons of pool toys.
  
  An obstacle course that changes year-round I have someone that comes in and changes it.
  
  BBQ Pits all around the pool and picnic tables and a roofed in shady area. Huge shady roofed in area.
  
  Then a Gatorade and Powerade fountains. 10 diff flavors each. And a sparkling water fountain. 20 diff flavors. Regular water fountains. (5) Cola fountains. Soda. (20 diff flavors) Fresh lemonade. Both strawberry and reg. And then juices in a huge refrigerator. Ex. apple juice. Cranberry. Orange juice... A Beverage bar with a few bartenders.
  
  A pizzeria.
  
  A DJ that comes in when I want him to.
  
  A waterproof gaming area. Where you can still sit in the pool and play.
  
  A giant adult splash pad. And more.
  
  And then I would have a mini Buffet area that has tons of awesome foods.
  
  Minnie boat area with dance floors and a warm room. Go to the warm room to not be so cold after getting out the water.
  
  Dryer area.
  
  Volleyball beach area with sand and small beach that goes up to 10 feet deep.
  
  Tanning area.

  Nah but with the cornbread and rice on the side and cooking by yourself it can. Especially if it is a new dish you are learning.

Mash up some of the beans in it to make it thicker and then make sure your cornbread is a little sweet because it goes well with the reb beans juices. And then add butter to the red bean juice too.

  Be careful with who you fall for because if you want to marry that person that's going to be the person you're going to be with for the rest of your life. A lot of people make this mistake. I make sure I didn't. I love my husband. I just don't want to see my best friend go down. He was someone that's going to abused them or something. Do what's best for you in life. And just be careful. Be patient. Because the right person will come in your life naturally.

   So, does this mean you have worked in a hospital before? Yes, doctors and such will try to convince you that they are innocent and you're the problem! The more people who complain, the better, though. At least you speak out about it now instead of letting them do what they want.
  ","
  No I have never worked at any sort of facility like that. But I know what you mean. I guess I was just so traumatized by her that I just wanted to get away from it you know what I mean? But yeah if something like that happens to me again I'm going to try to do to better and try to complain about it instead. But as I said before I'm pretty sure that they most definitely got terminated shortly after that situation. Hopefully. I'm sure. But yeah I don't wish it on anyone. Sucked for reals.

  Yes and my experiences and hotels were usually good. More good than bad.
  "
32512,"
   Is it possible to file a complaint when it comes to doctors who mistreat you? If they can't do their job properly, they shouldn't have it at all, in my opinion. It's a shame they put you through that, it sounds traumatizing. But it seems like you have a good heart to want to help people, regardless!
  ","
  Yeah I definitely want to help other people. That was the thing. I couldn't believe they were treating me like that and I am the way I am you know what I mean? It's just surprising on how they treat other people that you know what I mean are difficult or something maybe more? But honestly they were all like that. So if I was to file a complaint honestly I think that they would all gang up and say that they didn't do anything wrong and that I was just crazy or something. LOL it didn't make any sense at all. But yeah. They most definitely were not doing me right. And I'm sure I had other clients that were there that could have vouched for me. I just wanted to get away from them. But yeah I was kind of young when this happened so I guess I never thought about reporting them. I'm sure that they got fired soon after there's no way they didn't. If they were treating me like that I'm sure they treated other people after me like that.
  "
32513,"
   Where is the best place for a vacation?
  ","
  Just getting in a car and going into a direction and just exploring. Not knowing what you're going to do next. Research the things in your area and what to do find you a hotel and then go and do those things not knowing what you were going to do. Of course take off a week of work and make sure that your back in time to do your everyday duties at home but honestly some of the trips that are not planned and what to do are the best. Makes you feel free and that you're exploring. Not so much stress. Of course pack anything and everything because you might do anything and everything. But sometimes some of those kinds of trips are the best in my thoughts. Say for instance you start in Louisiana and you just go up to Michigan from Louisiana to Michigan and just do all kinds of things from that point to the other point. Maybe stay an estate at a time for 2 days. And maybe take off a week or two.
  "
32514,"
   I have faith in you overcoming it! I fear the thought of my lover dying and getting hurt, too. I hate the weak feeling after blood has been taken from you. And I understand that, my mother has a disease and has been treated as a kind of guinea pig for doctors who had no clue what they were doing. :/
  ","
  Yeah. I'll be able to overcome in unless of course it's a actual medical thing I can't do. Which I think it kind of is but I'm not sure. Don't want to experiment of course LOL. But yeah I am really angry that those people did that to me but that is the past and I can't do nothing about it. All I know is when I do go to a doctor I tell them about my past experiences before they do it so they understand why I get really massively upset when they are taking blood from me. I let them know that I was harassed once. I let them know that I was felt uncomfortable before. I let them know all of the past events that happened to me last time I had it happen. But yeah. I don't appreciate people using us as guinea pigs especially if they don't ask. If they want to use me as a guinea pig asked me. Most of the time I don't care and I'll let you do it. But don't just do it off of you wanting to. You never know how things affect people.

   What is your favourite meal to cook and eat?

  I love crawfish spaghetti. It's very challenging to make the softest at I like making homemade red sauce and I love crawfish because it just tastes really good. I also like to make it a little spicy.
  "
32516,"
   I completely get it. For some reason I can look at blood as it is, but if it's in a test tube I cringe, and I'm afraid of needles and the sight of someone getting a shot. I think it's natural to fear blood, though, because it reminds us of death and negative things. But it also represents life.
  ","
  I guess just because I know people are suffering again. I'm not more or less scared of myself dying I just don't like losing people and seeing the people that I love and just people getting hurt. Such as people just having people inflict pain on them murder or more. If you know what I mean there. The only reason why I freak out when I get blood taken from me is because it makes me feel really bad. My body does not like having blood taken from it at all. It naturally just shuts down when it gets blood taken from it so that's why I don't really like it plus I have bad experiences with doctors not knowing what they were doing. I didn't know that they didn't know what they were doing. I trusted them. They were supposed to be professionals.  This happens once in a blue moon I don't know why. They poked me tons of times not understanding how to do what they were doing. Honestly if they didn't know what they were doing they shouldn't have done it. Been doing it. They traumatized me really bad. They also said a lot of really messed up things to me. They said a lot of really messed up things to me for no reason. I didn't do anything wrong to them to say those things to me. I was so confused. They kept asking me if I had been drinking? Which I hadn't been? I was terrified and confused and feeling weak because they kept poking me and taking so much blood from me... ? and made me feel really bad. Both physically and mentally. I'm not exactly afraid of needles but I just don't like the sight of people not knowing what they're doing in the medical room when they're supposed to be... you know... have went to school for it and have their license or whatever you know what I mean? Horrible experience. I hope I never have to go through it again honestly. I actually love giving blood because it made me feel good. It made me feel like I was saving lives and which I was but I don't do it anymore because of the certain situations. Sad to say... But hopefully I can overcome some day.
  "
32517,"
   Yeah, I understand what you mean. It is embarrassing to be so helpless and have to rely on others for things like defecation. It's quite sad. But it is embarrassing to have people feel bad for you, most of all, hm.
  ","
  But yeah I don't mind helping older people at all it's just I can't bear to do that. I can do a lot of different things there's just a few things that I can't do. Another thing I can't do is work with too much blood. I pass out and get really sick and faint. Idk. It's strange. Flashbacks and just really bad thoughts come to my mind with blood I don't know why.

  ? well I never said that you couldn't recycle them I'm just saying that you probably can recycle them and I'm sure there's plenty of people that do recycle them.

  Crazy enough. This is something that happens a lot.

   Do you still eat restaurant food or you strictly eat home made food because of corona virus
  ","
  Just depends. We actually haven't really ate in at a restaurant and probably four or five months now because of coronavirus. If I go into a mess I have to personally clean now my entire Booth or table and spray around it and they're not going to let me do that probably so I'm not going to eat there because I'm not about to take the risk of getting sick because they're not cleaning their tables correctly. I do not go into restaurants that I have too many people. If there's not a lot of people like maybe 10 people if that that I will go in but I honestly haven't got the opportunity because every time I have went to one there has been more than 10 people. So no I have not been eating at restaurants since coronavirus but we have been ordering takeout. But not often because we're still trying to be careful. I'm used to cooking so it's not really that big of a deal. So I do Miss some of my restaurant food but it's not honestly a big deal. I can live without it. It's not the end of the world.

32768,"
   Thanks
  ","
  You're welcome. Making these types of things from scratch taking lot of work practice and technique. Usually you have to grow up in the culture to be able to do things like that but it's definitely possible to learn. But you need to be around people that know how to make it and watch very closely.
  
  But making Gumbo from scratch can be a little tedious. So that's why I recommend the boxes with the directions on the back because they may not taste 100% the best but they are pretty close. Plus making the homemade ones could take a lot and cost a lot of money.
  
  But yeah I most definitely recommend those kinds of things. Also crawfish fettuccine or shrimp fettuccine are really good Cajun dishes to make that aren't that hard to make. Crawfish bisque is a little hard to make but that's another recipe and the South that we make.
  
  Just a few more.

  This isn't a complete sentence so I'm not sure exactly what you were asking. Are you asking me what is the most spiciest food I've ever had? I've had hundreds of different types of extremely spicy foods.
  
  We had a crawfish boil with extremely spicy boiled in the food. Different types of foods in Cajun dishes with high bernero Ghost Pepper or Carolina Reaper in them sometimes. It just depends.
  
  Louisiana peppers are pretty darn delicious but can be a little hot sometimes but there is really good with different types of recipes

   I'm from up north but wanna try some southern dishes ? Any recipes you could suggest ?
  ","
  Jambalaya is really simple to make. And you don't always have to make it really spicy. You can look up really simple recipes online and you can also get the boxes that have the directions on the back deliver to your house. On jambalaya is a meat or to rice water and seasoning. That's a simplified jambalaya.
  
  Gumbo is also really easy to make. It's almost just like jambalaya but at the same time it's not. It's a meat or two for 3 seasoning and is has more like a soup. You can also look up small simplified recipes for gumbo. You can also get the boxes sent to your house with the directions on the back. Sides with gumbo are usually potato salad and rolls. Potato salad is really easy to make it's just potatoes boiled until they're done. Eggs boiled until they're done. You peel the eggs you peel the potatoes you mash them up a little bit and then you add mayonnaise and mustard until it tastes correct and the way that you wanted to be tasting. You add more mayonnaise and mustard. Mustard is really for color. You add salt and pepper and you can have pickles onions and whatever else you want the potato salad. Potato salad is not exactly a salad. We just call it that it's a salad of its own out of potatoes and eggs. It's good with Black Eyed Peas with the gumbo and with the rolls. You can look up potato salad recipes online. When I make the Black Eyed Peas I usually add bacon to them for flavor.
  
  Homemade chocolate pies are awesome and so are sweet potato pies. You can also add cinnamon to sweet potato pie. You can look up homemade recipes online.
  
  This is just a few Southern recipes and ideas.
  
  It's all about technique. Taste your food while you are cooking it.
  
  When you're making the gummo the rice is separate. When you're making the jambalaya the rice is in it

  Us out here in Mississippi and Louisiana we hunt and fish. So it honestly wouldn't affect me near to none.

It wouldn't affect me really near to none. And if we couldn't get certain supplies I would build them and have substitutes for things. Sometimes you just got to appreciate what you got.

  I really enjoy riding bikes. Two years of my life when I lived in Louisiana where I live everything was around me and I could travel just a mile or two to get to where I needed to. I lived in a small town where there were tons of stores surrounding where I lived at in my home. So I used a bike as my transportation for almost two years straight. After I moved I'm not able to do that now because I live out in the countryside where there are lots of wild animals it is scorching hot and it could be quite dangerous riding your bike near a highway because people actually tried to hit people here but that was one source of exercise was my everyday transportation of riding my bike. I also like to walk jog lift weights and play many different types of sports. I also try to watch my way of eating and how much I eat and what time I eat at.

   Cinnamon in chilli yes or no ? Explain ?

  People use cinnamon as a way of a spice considering it is a spice but to make something hot more or less. And I guess that's not a problem. Me personally I'm allergic to cinnamon and cannot have any of it at all so cinnamon and chili yes or no I say no
  
  But to someone that likes cinnamon and can eat cinnamon? I don't feel like that's crazy at all. But I'm not sure how much you should put. Eating too much cinnamon can really make anyone sick and can overthrow the flavor of things. So just be aware of how much you put in there of course. Because you don't want it just tastes like cinnamon right? You want to taste the chili. And you don't want to end up in the bathroom for the rest of the day

  They have Oreo biscuits?. Just sounds strange
  
  Unless you're referring biscuit as a cookie? But doesn't USA we usually refer cookies to just cookies. That's where the confusion comes in at. I had to think this answer and question
  
  Because biscuits in the USA is actually baked bread. A breakfast Circle biscuit type thing. Usually you would add jelly or butter to. Or eating meat on as a sandwich in the morning such a sausage bacon or ham with cheese egg or whatever you choose.
  
  So that's where the confusion came in. I forget that sometimes people refer biscuits to cookies. But I most definitely love Oreos they're really good.

  ","
  Biotin
  
  And really any vitamins b c and d and e are good for hair growth.
  
  But before taking vitamins I will discuss with your doctor before doing because some vitamins are not healthy for certain humans because the body naturally gets those vitamins. Or you could be on a type of medication that does not mix with the type of vitamin. So just check with your doctor before taking certain vitamins. Taking too much of a vitamin can really mess up your body.
  
  Getting your hair trimmed at least every three months is really good for hair growth.
  
  Eating the right foods for hair growth is really a good way of going
  
  Don't wash your hair every single day. More strain on your care of makes more hair come out. Don't brush your hair still hard be very careful when you brush your hair. Try to let your hair air-dry. Don't use a hair dryer or straightener is all the time.
  
  Warm to cold showers are really good on the hair.

When it's 20 degrees that's the only time I put a jacket on and I only own two or three jackets. I own a thin hunting jacket. Which I usually wear that one because it has holes in it purposely so air can flow through it so I'm not completely warm. Jackets make me really hot even after a few min.
  
  I don't own any of the above I don't own fur coats. I don't own any leather jackets. Every now and then I wear my husband High School letter jacket that he got. Just because I loved it but it honestly makes me hot after a few minutes so I don't put it on for long. Really I don't wear any of the above. I own one or two hoodies and a sleeveless hoodie jacket that still keeps me warm. And then I may be owned one or two other jackets. That's total of maybe five jackets. I don't really use them because I like the cold and I don't like to be warm. Unless it's snowing or 20° Fahrenheit I don't wear a jacket.
  
  And if it's raining. If it's pouring I'll put a jacket on. But only to protect myself from getting drenched

  Nice!
  
  (Just an idea)
  
  You should make some good food for him! Offer him some wonderful hospitality when he comes over to visit! Offer him food and drink, which I'm sure that you guys do that anyway! but that would be so awesome if he came over and you guys did that! Have a little bbq or something made or some little finger sandwiches or something. Those are the best! That would be so nice! Do like a small lunch kinda thing. (Just me talking and saying an idea. Y'all don't have to do it. I'm just being goofy.)

  But honestly you shouldn't hate what you do in a job. If you don't like it, look for another job BUT! keep doing with what you're doing.. Just try to look for other places to go to... work while you look.
  
  You should at least kind of enjoy your job. Every job is going to have conflicts and people you don't like and things you don't want to do. But you shouldn't not like to do anything and everything and not enjoy the people you work with it all and all of them. That's not a healthy environment to be an everyday. If you don't like what you do. Like I said... just try to look for something else and in the meantime still do what you are doing at your job. Because at the end of the day it's/that's a job.

   A good night to all! What ways do you use to fall asleep?
  ","
  Thanks and sometimes I like to take a warm shower before bed brush my teeth my hair get some fresh clothes on get a little bit of lavender and. It on my face but before that I do an acne treatment and just relax my face. Maybe put some lotion on. Get me some water or some sweet tea before I lay down. I don't exactly recommend the sweet tea to everyone but I like a little bit of sweet tea before bed. But then I dab a little bit of lavender on my face and then get a washcloth and try to wash it off as much as possible because Lavender is really strong but lavender will soothe you to sleep, especially after a shower.
  
  For some reason I find sleeping with my animals a better way to go to sleep. Animal cuddles.
  
  I make sure the room temperature is adjusted well maybe turn the fan on or something.
  
  Make sure I have fresh sheets if I'm not comfortable. And just overall make sure I'm comfortable the room is dark and yea. I have to have quiet except for maybe a fan or a train sound background for some reason. I like a train sound. But yeah. These are the things that help me go to sleep.

  I can't stand it when they start popping fireworks like 2 weeks ahead of time. You should really just pop around the 4th of July and then like a few days before and maybe a day or two after your but after that you shouldn't pop anymore fireworks.

   Was iPhone, Android, slider cell phone your first phone? Mine was slider cell phone
  ","
  I never had a phone until I was almost like 13 or 14 or 15. And it was a flip phone that was shared by a few of my sisters. But I was the one who kept a hold of it. But if they needed to use it they could.
  
  And the only reason why I got a phone is because we had a  really horrible natural disaster that ended up happening once and I was scared that something might happen to us and we wouldn't be able to call my mom to save us if something was to happen or call 911 or something. Because honestly we were flooding one time and we almost couldn't get to the office to call my mom's come and get me plus how would she get there because it's flooding right? And it happened so fast. If I would have known it was happening I could have called her ahead of time and gotten out of there. So that's one of the reasons why I got a phone at the age of 13 or 14 or 15. And the only reason why I got it was call my mom and my grandparents and my sisters. It was not for friends.

  Sometimes you just got to go in. You can't always be afraid because then what happens if you miss a good opportunity with someone really special right?
  
  Just don't get so into it so early. Take your time. Have levels. It's better to take your time anyway because then if you go too fast and you're going to miss all of those first time type moments.

  It offers you different types of background, statistics, different types of feature programs. Sometimes you can earn different types of free merchandise through the VIP program. And then it kind of keeps you active if you follow the daily and weekly tasks. I mean you don't have to have it it's not really that big of a deal.

  Right.
  
  Like one time I had this friend that would always ask me for a dollar and then the next day he would ask me for another dollar and then maybe a week later he would ask me for another dollar and then the next day he would ask me for $2 and then two days later he would ask me for another dollar but he would never give me a dollar when I needed it and then the time that I did really actually asking for a dollar when I needed he said well you never gave me any money? I told him you probably owe me almost twenty bucks but you know I don't tell you you owe me anything but when I give you a favor and when I come to you for something and then you want to lie and be disrespectful then your dollar person ain't going to be there for you no more. He could have at least said he didn't have a dollar. I would have understood? ?
  
  You want to know what that's called people that are toxic and Beggars I have no respect for you and I are only there for you for your money. Those are the kind of people you have to push out because they're only temporary. You're not going to be able to forgive everybody. You're not going to be able to be friends with everybody. You're not going to be able to be kind to everyone. Because it's always going to be a hater for no reason. Because they hate themselves.
  
  But that's good that you easily forgive. Just watch out for toxic people. Because they'll keep causing you stress in your life until you want to pull your hair out or go see a psychiatrist

She loved this place. This is a place where she always took him oh, the guy she was with and would tell him all the stories about her paw paw and how beautiful the place was. The guy asks why would you want to come with me? And stay with me where I am at? This place is so beautiful... She said because your beautiful. I can always come back to this. It's our time. A few years later that's when he asked her to marry him in the same spot. She said yes of course. They waited about a year and she walked into the room and said I'm ready to get married to you. Would you like to marry me today? Or tomorrow? He looked at her in surprised of how spontaneous her question was. He loved it. He said whenever you want. Not even a week later they were married. They have always gotten along. The trust the patients the distance the obstacles that they went through together. There isn't anything that can stop them.

  Well one time 6 to 7 years ago this girl was playing Xbox 360 with one of her friends and they were making her upset so she decided to go and make a new friend in the same Lobby that they were all in together. She went and rode over to this guy on the map and she made it known that she was going to try to make friends with this person. She then walked up to the person on the video game and the person felt threatened so they almost tried to kill her. But instead something told them not to and she got in their car and the dude got in their car and just drove her around for a while. The two people finally got to wave Xbox Live party where they could actually hear each other and talk and started to exchange friendly words and greetings. The two immediately hit it off and became friends. Ever since that day they were good friends. Maybe about a week later she started to notice some sort of feelings for that person. But she ignored it and kept being friends with the person. She most definitely could tell that he liked her. They kept exchanging words back and forth and talking as friends and after a couple of weeks they actually told each other they really liked each other. Maybe a week or so after that they started dating. He was very protective of her and demanded respect from other people for her. A lot of people didn't respect her and was rude to her. Including her ex-boyfriend which he did not like at all and a lot of her friends did not like at all. He always treated her horrible. So him and her friends laid into him and him their feelings about him. The dude left her alone. What she wanted. Her and the new fellow she met that was actually treating her right way after started dating. They were getting along and doing very well. About 6 or 7 months into the relationship they met each other. Everything went well. After months of video chatting and getting to know each other's family they finally got to see each other. It was a moment like no other. This story will con.

  Both at a time is really good for you.
  
  Going to the gym 5 days out of the week working on many different parts of the body and staying at the gym for at least maybe an hour. Maybe wake up in the morning and go for an hour in the morning to wake yourself up. Very early in the morning. And then before going eat a breakfast snack and then when you com back in eat another breakfast snack and then go on into your day. If you get hungry again. Snack ad then when dinner comes around make you before 5 or 6 o'clock a small medium sized dinner. Watch what you eat. The size intake. Make sure you are gonna be active for another 3 or 4 hours so you can metabolism work that food down before you selling down and sleeping. It's not always good to go to sleep on a full stomach.

  I don't try to procrastinate I just try to do them and get it over with. There are going to be things in the world that we don't want to do and sometimes you just have to do them because then you're not going to get done. And somebody has to do them right? Might as well get them done and over with some rather than sit there and wait till the last minute and almost risk not doing it at all and forget. Then you'll have to suffer the consequences of not doing it because you waited. That's why procrastination isn't the best. Better not to do.

   What pasta sauce do you make in home ? Can u tell the ingredient what u add in sauce
  ","
  I really honestly like to throw a type of sauce together with many different types of things. Say for instance I'm making a spaghetti right okay... But I will chop up tomatoes or get me a can of tomatoes and a can of tomato paste and will create my sauce. Out it together. (Or you can just simply get you a can of already ready tomato sauce from your local grocery. They have that too and that can save you time if you don't want to make home made. Ragu. The traditional one or the meat added one.) But I will just get some tomatoes and smash them down and even make my own. You just have to adjust it with salt, garlic, Italian seasonings, maybe even some of the minced garlic more or less. Onions different spices and other sauces.
  
  Just things like that to make and shape your own homemade spaghetti sauce. I think honestly making your own homemade is the best because you can make it taste the way you want. You can make the sauce more Tangy or maybe more sweet or maybe strong-tasting or spicy. When you're making your own homemade, you need to slowly make it and try the food as you go. Taste the sauce. If it does not taste good, then add different seasonings to your taste buds to the sauce to make it taste the way that you want. Sometimes you have to add more water to make it more liquidy and sometimes you have to add more tomatoes and thick tomato pulp to thicken the sauce more. Adding even a slight bit of different types of BBQ sauce and sugars can help also make the sauce taste better. But honestly that's just what I do. I like my spaghetti sauce to taste really really good and not be so harsh on your stomach when going down. Rather had it more natural than all those canned preservatives in it. ?

   What day do you take out trash or bring it somewhere if it works that way?
  ","
  Honestly every other day we bring the trash to the road. We have a lot of trash out here on the countryside considering we cook a lot do a lot of yard work and the trashman doesn't come but once a week if that.
  
  We have to have a ginormous garbage disposal areas and we have to be really careful with how we put the garbage out or they won't take it. We have to put it in multiple bags and be very clean about it. Which I'm fine with. I have always been that way.
  
  But we have these giant garbage bins that we put our garbages in. Usually when we take the garbage out we gather all of the bags together and put them into another bag and then close that back. To prevent the back from busting and making a mess.
  
  But honestly the bags are really heavy and we bring them to the road and sometimes we accumulate anywhere from three to seven bags just depending on what's going on that week. Sometimes we have family over and we took and sometimes we get out in the yard and do yard work.
  
  Plus lately we have been doing work on our house so we have more garbage then usually lately

  ","
  I just think that people need to have self respect and confidence. And then have respect for other people and their property and their things. That's something I have always been raised to know and follow in life. And I always will follow that.
  
  Hygiene is extremely important always. Always try to look your best or try your best to look your best. As long as you're trying that's all that matters.
  
  I think that people just need to be honest and true to themselves and some people around them.
  
  Always have respect for your older folk. Always try to help them. Even when they're being disrespectful try your best to help them and just you know inside that you did your best and helped.
  
  Not everyone is going to appreciate everything you do is sometimes you have to do some bite the bullet and go on.
  
  Sometimes you just need to let some things go in one ear and out the other ear. Is it worth getting upset about? Is it worth making a scene about?
  
  We need to take care of the world in the Earth around us. The environment.

  First click into going to answering the question and then at the bottom of your page there should be different selections of things that you can post and do in your answers. That including your own pictures from your phone and downloads and stuff like that. And then they offer backgrounds with text.for your answers. Different colors and designs. You can also use a photo (from your gallery on your phone) as a background also. You just have to click the color/design backgrounds that they have available and then go to the top left corner and press the picture and it will let you convert the color design background and let you upload a picture to the background and that picture will become your background.
  
  That's a little more advanced and harder to learn but if you listen to exactly what I said you can do that.
  
  And also at the bottom of the page there is take a picture feature with the little camera and there is a GIF option too which you were asking about and that is at the bottom right of your page. There's also a three dotted button that was you multi share your answers to different social medias also other than Ask.fm.

   In your personal opinon why do you think people end up beoming so toxic?
  ","
  Corrupt influences. Both people, the tv, the news... where they are living and growing in/around. They're lack of self-control and upbringing. Their level of knowing what is reality and their knowing what is not. Them knowing what a joke is and then knowing when to be serious. Knowing when to be sensitive and no one when not to be. Knowing when something's enough. Having the right intentions in life. Understanding that trust and respect are important things and they need to work on those things always. Work on themselves all the time. They need to work on their self-esteem, confidence and their patience levels.
  
   All of these things if you're lacking them it can cause a really toxic person.
   
    You have to understand that the world is crazy and cruel and not everything is going to be handed to you. You have to work for it. ?

   i get bullied
  ","
  I'm sure everyone has some issues with being bullied in ways.
  
  To solve it.
  
  You have to stand up to your bully.
  
  I know some people say that that isn't the way, but it really is? I mean... You can't do it in a weak, stupid way. But beat them with the facts. With kindness and stand up to them. Don't give them any information about yourself. They don't know you and don't need to know you. Don't feed into their hate. They want you to give them attention. They are bored. That is why they are bothering you. You are giving them something what they want. You are putting a show on for them. Your entertaining them. Something. Just tell them to screw off once and be serious. Then move on. Don't look at them. Nothing. Ignore. Get away from them. If they touch you. You turn at them and look at them as serious as possible and tell them to not touch you and then if they keep touching you or hurting you. You teach them back how it feels to not want to be touched and defend yourself. And if they I want to start tattle telling and asking questions to why you touch them back... well then you tell them... well how do you like being touched when you don't want to be? That's what you kept doing to me? so I did it back. Leave me alone. As I said before. And do not touch me.
  
  And if they do it again. Stand up for yourself fully. And you know what I mean. They keep touching you. Physically defend yourself.
  
  I don't really recommend tattle tailing but I would definitely show signs of you not wanting them to touch you and you. Warnings. but at the same time you just want to walk away move on and ignore them. When you do that that's you showing that you're not feeding into them and you don't care but if they really start to touch you and stuff that is crossing the line. People should keep their hands to yourselves. There is absolutely no reason for them to have to put their hands on you.
  
  They touch 1st. Say no. And keep. Then you need to show that you don't want to be touched. Defend yourself
  "

I do not do it for the coins. I have never done it for the coins/?. I just do it to give you guys content to answer. Different content. Good content and which I hope that's what I do. AKA send out really good and different questions.

  Yeah. Don't leave! We love you dear! You are a very positive user on here! We want to keep you on here.
  
  I was really sad yesterday when I saw you disappear. I kinda figured it out cause I went to look earlier yesterday,  when I was scrolling, I saw your name on this question/message and thought it was so nice and I was like oh I'm going to save this one for last! Because I always save the best for last and when I went to go and find you... I couldn't find you! and I saw an anonymous name over that question... in the place which means that the user is not available on Ask.fm at the moment.. I just had to start asking questions because I was getting upset. Sorry. It is so sad to see such good users leave.
  
  I don't know what's going on, but I will say this... don't let these some of these anonymous people on this site run you away. Just ignore them. If you have to turn off your anonymous questions. Do it. I even do to sometimes. I beat them with facts and kindness. Don't let these ignorant trolls harass you. Just ignore them and don't feed into them, don't answer their questions and they won't bother you anymore and if they keep talking to you and sending questions, you just keep reporting and blocking. That's what I do. I ignore these ignorant racist people. I don't let them get to me.
  
  We appreciate you on Ask and want to continue to have you here! So don't leave! We love you

  I have a bottle of lavender essential oil and sometimes I put a little down on my neck and a little bit out of my nose then I get a washcloth and rub it in a little bit to not make it so strong with the smell.
  
  Before you do this taking your really warm shower for about 10 to 15 minutes is really good to help me go to sleep.
  
  Make yourself extremely comfortable. Make sure that your sheets are clean and that the room is adjusted at the temperature that you want. Make sure you're not too cold or too hot but perfectly comfortable.
  
  Honestly reading makes me really tired. Visualizing things in a book is almost like a TV show to me and makes me go to sleep really fast. So after you take a shower and apply the essential oils and get comfortable and adjusted temperature in your room may be read a book for a little. Lights all down of course but a small one to see your reading book.
  
  Make sure you have some water near you. Stay hydrated.
  
  These are all a few little tricks to go into sleep quickly.

   Hello?
  ","
  Um
  
  Hi
  "
33902,"
   28. When you leave a room in your house do you always turn the light off? or do you leave it on?
  ","
  I always try to leave any and every light off (we try to) in the house except... we always, 247 keep the laundry room light on because the light is kinda finicky. We also leave the light on above the stove. (That's it I think.) Keep the outside light on only at night.
  
  But the reason why we leave those few on is cause have dimness issues with my eyes so we always have to leave one or two small lights on throughout the house so I don't fall at night. But we honestly try to preserve light. Plus, to have a cheaper light bill. Also, I always grew (was raised) up to just have natural lighting going (always taught to save) on into the house and have no lights on. I also went to a school where we did that. We just decided to open the windows and use just projectors instead of putting multiple lights on. Plus when it was really hot in the summer that helps cool it down..
  
  But it's always good to keep one or two lights on in your house when you leave sometimes. Make it obvious that you are in the house. Just in case for people breaking in. Usually when they see a light on they won't try to break in especially out on the countryside.
  "

  Please anyone listen. I loved singing this.
  
  Singing is my passion.
  
  I'd love to share.
  
  We both sounded great.
  
  Though we found it most definitely quite lovely together our voices.
  
  My voice is a little deeper and harsher and I'm the first person who started so follow my voice that is me singing. And the softer voice is the person doing the duet with me.

  Depends on how you answer questions.

You have to ignore those kinds of questions. Especially the fact of how many catfish they have on here. So it all depends on the person answering the questions. Can you ignore trolls?

  And that about 2 years ago when I started my job I was in the deep freezer (bellow freezing. I think bellow 40) and I started to get really really cold, too cold and the door closed so I went to run out and I bashed my leg on a cart missing the exit... and do realize it was freezing in there... so I felt everything. It became purple red and it's swelled really bad and it bled. I hit it so hard that it bled. Not bad bled but it did and man... did it hurt? I found out I can speak a lot of more languages for sure at that moment when I hit it. But yeah... I didn't realize it was going to bruise as bad as it did but it. Left a mark. I think it's still there. Lol.

  I am friendly?
  
  I'm also married.
  
  But lol ? Just because I don't want to call you on the phone? doesn't make me *unfriendly*? It just means I don't want to call you.
  
  Why?
  
  Giving people on the internet, giving out my number on the internet is really not good. People can find you based off of your phone number. (Area code? Name? Umm.. It doesn't take much. Lol?) It's 2020. Did you ever think that's the reason why I don't want to get my phone number on the internet? Well. Thay is it. And this is what I tell everyone. Not just you.
  
  And I am not talking about you coming to find me, no. But then again. I don't know you or your intentions... so yeah. Idk ? But this site is public. Do you not understand that? It's not me being mean? Lol? It's me trying to keep my privacy safe. Being safe is good. Nothing wrong with that. There is a difference. Unfriendly? No. Trying to be smart and careful? Yes. You should say I am smart and careful. Because that's what I am doing. But oookay ?
  
  I'm literally the nicest anyone can meet knot trying to sound narcissistic or self-centered) for you to say I'm not is really interesting honestly... Lol hint the name ""Sweet Bella"" because honestly I literally get a joy out of being sweet people in making people laugh and smile.
  
  But to you... ? lol Somehow I am unfriendly for saying I don't want to call you.
  
  A married gal.
  
  Just because someone doesn't want to do something you want to do doesn't make mean and not nice? Okay? My point? Please at least learn the difference. Please.

  I am gonna tag just a few of random people who are invited to the party! Ayyye!
  
  Cajun boil.
  
  In the boil.
  
  I would pick a bunch of different things to boil considering the crowd would probably be big. You can pick what you want out of the boil.
  
  And honestly I put a lot of stuff in my boil anyway. And no, the things that I will mention, that I throw in are not odd. This is what Cajun folk throw in their crawfish boils all the time.
  
  Have the boil a little spicy.
  
  Always.
  
  Boil Crawfish.
  
  Crabs. REAL CRABS. Not King.
  
  Jumbo Shrimp ?
  
  Whole corn.
  
  Cajun spice Sausage
  
  Red Bryan hot dogs
  
  Asparagus, medium sized cabbages (not many. Just a few. They fall apart in the boil usually), green beans, mushrooms, onions of all kinds, lemons, oranges, pineapples. Garlic, bay leaves, celery. All of the fruits are added for the Citrus quality. And also it's a secret in the Cajun culture, it has a certain taste to the boil as sweetens it up and adds a delicious citrus perfection to the boil. As a type of flavor that we really like. Alligator sausages. Little sausages. And of course potatoes.
  
  But yeah. All these kinds of things can be added.
  
  And then I'm the side I would have my families generational crawfish sauce recipe. I would make that sauce for everyone to try.

   Okay... I do...but every girl says that she has a bf or she has a crush etc etc
  ","
  Not every single girl is taken. Sometimes you just have to let it happen naturally. If you want to just make it happen then it's not going to be true. Be patient. Be you. Girls want you to be yourself and take them slow. If you're hurrying a relationship then no one's going to want to be with you because she wants to take a relationship slow. Because you're going to miss the beginning parts of a relationship once you get into it. The beginning is your love story when it started.
  
  Time.
  
  Give it time.
  
  And get to know people before you just tell them how you want to be my girlfriend. Nobody's going to want to be with you if they don't know anything about you. And not just a few hours take days and weeks to get to know someone. Make a friendship first before you make a relationship. That is what I believe you're probably missing
  "
34462,"
   Is it hard to learn French?
  ","
  If you want to learn a new language I would take French or Spanish. Those are two really easy languages to learn how to speak. Another language I would encourage you to learn slowly is the basics of sign language. It's honestly really not that hard to learn. Another one is Braille. Sign language in Braille are the languages of the blind and deaf.

   Do you own a house ??

  We do but it's like shared with one other person. Like we have a roommate with us that we let stay here and they help with bills. We don't mind them staying but once they leave of course it is ours. So yes we own a house. Sometimes I just wish it was just us in it, if you know what I mean.
  "
34513,"
   This is a continue answer for this question and thread.
  ","
  There are a few sheets and pillowcases in there. And then there's a few new sheets that I found that I want to get worked on. And then I found some really cute baby blanket fabrics that I thought were adorable. So I held onto them because they were literally a couple cents. Ain't nothing wrong with thinking ahead of time for children and their blankets and stuff.
  
  We have a tradition in my family where we make each child a quilt or two and we consider it their baby blanket and it stays in their life that's theirs.
  
  When I moved here from Louisiana there's a few boxes in there with some of my stuff from Louisiana that I still haven't been able to take out. Like I said we still have a roommate and I don't want to take out things that mean a lot to me just in case if they get lost or broken of any kind.
  
  There's a few other things but I can't exactly remember. But this is a few things that are in our closet.
  "
34514,"
   what’s in your closet? besides clothes.
  ","
  Well of course like you said besides our clothes that are hanging in there. We have a few things that are for the kitchen, they are things that were given as presents that we either already have and they are backups, just in case, ya know.. if the other ones break or it's just things that we haven't gotten to to open just yet. Not many of them there's only a few things in there like that.
  
  Some things that were handed down from my grandparents. It's a special box of belongings from them that mean a lot to me. That they gave to me. Like some army stuff from my grandfather. And some really beautiful trinkets and more from both.
  
  Some of our shoes are at the bottom. Some more kitchen stuff is down at the bottom. When my grandparents passed away I inherited a lot of their kitchen stuff. A bunch of other things too I was inherited but I put the kitchen stuff in there to keep it protected. We still have a roommate so I don't really want to put everything in the kitchen just in case if they accidentally take something or break something. That would make me really upset.
  
  Then there is a bag of clothes that we don't want any more of that just in case if someone needs clothes we will give to them if not soon I will probably just donate them to a shelter. I really need to get rid of that because it's taking up room.
  
  I think there are a few persons in there of mine. A bag or two of his and maybe one that's mine I'm not sure can't remember.
  
  There are a few board games in there. I actually want to put them in the living room cause I want to make a really cute and gaming area display some when people come in and visit if they want to play a board game with us they can. Makes the house look really homie I think. Lol.
  
  There are a few quilts of my grandparents and my mom mom in there because they have been kind of worn down and I need to get them worked on so I keep them in there to keep them from getting any damage.

  Okay. Well my favorite...
  
  I really like..
  
  Broccoli, carrots, asparagus, cabbage, I don't mind brussel sprouts. That's a new one for me trying. Brussel sprouts. I like cauliflower but it's not my favorite. It's okay. I can eat it.  I like sugar peas and snow peas, snaps. Eggplant is pretty good. Cucumbers. Zucchini and yellow squash is good. Melatonins are pretty good. I love celery and lettuce. I like fresh green beans. I like onions and potatoes both sweet and white. Onions of all kinds. I like garlic. And more. Some.
  
  I don't really like raw Tomatoes I usually just like tomatoes cooked. Cherry tomatoes are okay. I don't mind them. Are good.
  
  Just tomatoes in general I used to cook with a lot. I like to make different types of bread sauces with them. Spaghetti is popular here in America.
  
  Down in the South, people like to fry green tomatoes. They slice them up and make them a green fried tomato sandwich. This is popular here in America in the South.
  
  I have been to Florida before a few times. Nice and beautiful place.
  
  I have never left my country before unfortunately. I would love to go and travel the world one day. ❤

  I mean... It's just a way of keeping track of people in order of how many points/? each person has. It keeps track every day and it's tax for the week. The fire. It stacks.
  
  Every country has a leaderboard and then the leaderboard can keep take with your people that you are following. Your friends.

  You need to follow laws. Don't date a minor if you're older than them and you're not following the laws and stuff.

  This is riiight after it was finished. So it may look a tad sore. After they feel they come out looking absolutely marvelous.
  
  We have been having these tattoo for a few years. We just got the word added on. It was just a diamond for a few years. But we decided to get it updated and a little added on. Are matching tattoos with Jason. My husband.
  
  His being a little bit more bigger than mine, because he's a bigger guy and mine being smaller of course because I'm a short, small gal.
  
  Him blue cause he loves blue.
  
   Me red because I love red.
   
    Us. Together.
    
    Blue and red make purple when together.
    
    That being the theme of the tattoo.
    
    Me and him were in a long distance relationship for 4 and 1/2 to 5 years. But the tattoo resembles the event that happened in our life. Separation. (Even though we were apart. We went strong with our relationship. Always kept in contact. Always had that strong loyalty and trust. We both fought through it together.) Which we met in April and that is the birthstone of April which is a diamond.
    
    If you have ever looked up the meaning of a diamond. The meaning behind a diamond. It's Unbreakable. Strong. And beautiful. Beautifully built. And it takes time. For a diamond to form. It's rare . Our relationship and our love story is rare . You don't hear everyday this kind of stuff going on. Sounds like something out of a storybook honestly. Sounds unbelievable. But we did The Impossible... but the diamond... It's full. And I fill his heart with love. So that's why I got Love and he got the word full. Just something sweet for us. Something that symbolizes us. Our love story. Going back and forth with distance for years and then finally being able to be together forever. Finally. At last. We are Inseparable. Unbreakable. How we have always been.
    
    That little bitty tattoo hold those beautiful stories and tough events. Many nights of missing him and him missing me. All of the traveling. Meeting knew places and people. The adventure. The beauty in it all.

  My bad. Read it wrong! I'm sorry! I do that sometimes... My apologies.
  
  I mean I think it would be okayish to just have family as friends but I think you should have venture more. Go out and get more friends. Diff. Different people in different environments and experience. Teaches you more about the world and reality. If you're constantly sheltered all the time and only around those kinds of people then you're not going to click with reality and everyday life properly... I think.... in my opinion. But I don't think there's really problem with having just family members as friends other than that.. but honestly that's a pretty big problem so I guess at the same time it's not really good to just have family as friends. I guess it's all about how you go about it right?

   Is it bad to not have friends except your family members?
  ","
  Eh.. All depends..  Some people just don't want to accept people because they're jealous and they're just not good with people and that is wrong. And then there are some people that just don't want to be around some people because they're not really that great of an influence or maybe not really not positive or something. That is understandable. But this is just a few examples. There are many different situations that this could revolve around. It just all depends on the intentions of the person to why they don't want to stuff that family member of yours

   So I just randomly remembered that in my first elementary school, every Friday a different parent would prepare lunch for the whole class :) Have you ever remembered something like that out of the blue, even if you never thought of it for years?
  ","
  Yeah. All the time this happens. I remember certain things that happened to me when I was really really young and school and at home with my sisters. At my Maw maw's and Paw Paw's sometimes. Different types of vacations we went on together with the family. Sometimes going fishing or maybe going to the thrift store or going out to eat together. All these were such good times.
  
  I remember one time we went out the different thrift shops and that was so much fun because we just found the silliest stuff. One time I found this Halo Reach shirt and that is literally one of my favorite games and it fit me perfect and I think I wore that shirt to the ground. (Wore it until it. fell apart basically) Loved that shirt! I remember going up to my mom and showing her and she said throw it in the cart! because she knew how much I loved the game. I really appreciated that from my mom. She loved it when I found gimmies like that. Good find.
  
  I also remember every year for each one of my sisters and my birthday we would be able to pick what we wanted for dinner. My mom cooked so good. I love her home cook meals and miss them. Lately I have been calling her and asking her how to cook some of them so I could re-taste them and remember.

  ","
  A Swan is my spirit animal.
  
  And I don't know. You just know what your spirit animal is. Sometimes it takes a while to find out what it is but it's just something deep down inside, that gives you a sign that that is what is your spirit animal is. It's really hard to understand or explain. But I think that the animal that I've mostly can relate to is the swan. It's very independent and intelligent and it is very protective and very leading of the pack. They wander happy and peacefully. The creatures are born very different looking to what they are when they are full grown. This most definitely for humans is a sign of a growing process in life that has to be done. Is that at first we learn throughout our life when first born and young and then we bloom into the wonderful and beautiful and lovely human being. We spread our wings and fly.
  
  Swans are also really good for making families. They don't leave anyone behind.  And they take care of their young very well.

  Just wear a simple cologne a spray to the top of you and it sprays the bottom of you should be just enough depending on how strong the smell of cologne is that you're wearing.

  ","
  When I'm at Jason 6 and a half years ago online. I was with somebody else at the time right? Well that person was not treating me well... at all right?... Yeah.. well and me and Jason were just friends 100%. Really, just friends. But like even almost deleted him at one point because he treated me so well. Always there for me. And Jason treated me even better than the guy that I was with. Lit. And that's sad.. But something about him he just could not stand about the person that I was with because they just were not treating me right. And it would make Jason so mad... He just wanted so bad to go off on that dude. But every time I would say no. Please don't... Just to avoid conflict you know? And in his head you know he's like he doesn't deserve her... he's treating her horrible. And him thinking I could treat her so much better. I even almost deleted Jason at one point because I 100% I'm true to the one I'm with and that was my ex right? but like... at the same time I wanted to get out of it... I felt stuck... because like I said... he just wasn't treating me right. My ex.. And so finally I had the guts one day and ended it with me and my ex and Jason and a bunch of people I knew. My homies! ?stuck up for me but Jason most definitely stood out to me.. He went.. absolutely off on that dude. Every word true. Was just so angry on how he treated me. He just always at day one always protected me. I was important to him and he wanted the world for me from day one. He just seemed like he wanted to take care of me. And just loved me and loved being around me. I just had a safe haven that I really loved I'm still inlove. That's the kind of love that you want to hold onto. Somebody that 100% would do anything for you an do the same back for you. It's mutual. It's just something you know. It's really hard to explain.. But yeah.

  Honestly it's whatever that man that I really like wants to do. I don't really mind what he wants to do as long as he doesn't look sick an unhealthy or something.

My husband has a goatee and a mustache and sometimes grows his goatee into a beard on occasion and I don't mind it at all. If he wanted to shave it all off, yeah... I would be a little sad but if he wants to do that, he can. It's whatever he wants to do. What he prefers. What he's comfortable with. Whatever he's comfortable with, I'm happy with also.

If you see a repeater then maybe the situation needs to be taken further.
  
  Also people that are clearly just harassing people. Mega bad jealous hate kinda bullying. Trolling. Spaming. Scams and then catfish people on here are baaad bad... There are so many. Them. Violent and threatening people. Nodrug talk at all. Stuff like that. And then every now and then I see a child on here of 8 or 9 or younger... They don't need to be on here... It's bad on here.

  One the tattoo is a long distance tattoo of course cause we were in a long distance relationship for 5 years almost.
  
  But the word, full. I complete his diamond ?.
  
  The diamond is actually really special to us because this is the month we met in or when we started dating around. But yeah. We met around Feb and starting dating in April. So Amethyst is also very important to us too. Purple. And then red. I love red. Ruby. Sapphire is also quite important to us. It being blue.  And as you can see.. all those colors are in the tattoo. Painted, flowing through. Him blue. Me red. And us together. Cause red and blue make purple. Just a very artistic way of looking at it. Our love story. A diamond ? also meaning that we are full and inlove and unbreakable. A diamond is full. I full his diamond with love. Lots of little cute clues that add up together to the tattoo.
  
  Little confusing prob too. But like you'd honestly have to be us to fully understand the sweetness behind it all. It's beautiful.

  Usually at the top of their profile it will say they're active which means that they were online or they have been online that day at some point or something. But you can ask them questions whenever you want because eventually they will see the questions when they come online. Some people will be appearing invisible so you won't even know if they're online sometimes.
  
  Unless you're talking about like how do you know if somebody has stopped coming online?
  
  You can look at their most recent answers and if it says that they haven't been on for like two or three months... then that looks like they probably won't come back online, but that's not always the case some people come back on but if people haven't been on for a few months, I'll usually unfollow them because if they're not being active and that means they aren't going to answer questions or ask anything.
  
  Some people I won't unfollow but I will unfollow inactive accounts. Like people that haven't been on in months

  That's one of the things that VIP Plus allows us to do. It gives us the choice to make our answers secret so people have to unlock them with coins because some of them are a little personal if you know what I mean?
  
  But I wouldn't press it because then it will make you have to unlock it with a thousand coins. I honestly only use the secret feature for really personal questions and for people that are posting as anonymous. Because sometimes they ask questions that are really personal and they ask anonymously. If again you know what I mean.

  You reward people based on the quality of their answers.
  
  You think, how well did they answer this question?
  
  I think pretty good! I'm going to give them some fire ? but just a little not a ton. It was a pretty good answer. Gives them 20 fire for their answer or maybe just 5 coins or maybe 25. Just up to you.
  
  But be careful and keep an eye out on your wallet. You don't wanna lose all your coins. Give what you can and try to answer other people's questions well so they will reward you in the end. You are not always going to get rewarded for your answers so be aware of that.
  
  Also be aware that alot of stuff takes awhile to load and update on here. Your wallet may not immediately show the deduction that you gave to someone. This app has alot of glitches too. So yeah..

35074,"
   What happens if someone follows you. Like if you followed me like right now?
  ","
  Your followed.
  
  The only thing about the following system on here, on Ask.fm, is it doesn't show who followed you or who follows you. Your notification will let you know that someone followed you but it won't tell you who is following you. And it will also keep track of how many followers you have.
  
  But to me, this site isn't really about followers. It's more or less just about answering and asking questions and the quality of your answers and your questions. This site is about being active. Since you can't see who follows you, then really it's not even about follows. Right? At the end of the day at least in my eyes I feel that.
  
  I love my followers for sure, but I'm not focused on the number's. I could have 10 followers for 5,000, I don't really care about the number as like a ? trophy or something... I'm just happy that you guys are following me. I appreciate you guys's company. I appreciate y'all in general. And thanks for that for anyone who reads and sees this.
  
  Another thing that I will tell you is there are leaderboards. Every country. The more active you are and the better quality questions that you ask and answer, people will reward you wil ? fire/coins and there are numbers that will start to appear at the top of your profile. Rank in your country on your leader board. There are daily coins and week. (When people give you/reward you) Everyday records stack and then stack for the week. Like say someone gives you 50 today and then 50 more later. You got 100 coins for the day. Okay.. Tomorrow they give you another 25, then maybe 50 the next day. At the end of the week it will all add up together but then restart at the end of the week. The coins go in your wallet. But the records will go away after that week. Start over.
  
  Also you have a daily coin limit. It varys for all. Just depends. All complicated. Lol alot but yeah. Some info for ya.
  
  Your welcome.
  
  If you have more ?'s.

  It can be many different things. It could be asked deleting a post that somebody gave you fire under because it might have been flagged and then they remove them and any coins underneath those posts get deleted to and go back to the owner that gave them to you.
  
  It could be a ask glitch and they are taking them from you out of your wallet. I have been hearing that a few people that have been having those problems also. Everybody has a fire wallet. That's all of your coins together.
  
  You could be giving them out and not realizing it because when you give them out then whatever you give out gets - minus from your wallet. So yeah.
  
  Many diff things.

   What does confidence mean to you? I guess to some it might be down to looks, but others it's down to what's going on inside etc
  ","
  Confidence is almost like almost self faith in a person for their self. Without confidence then you almost don't even know yourself. When you 100% don't have any confidence. It's almost like you're lost... That's kind of how confidence is for me. I have to have confidence and even when I(we) think I(we) don't have it I(we) have it and you have to convince yourself that you do have it and then you have to work at it. Work at yourself. You can't keep constantly looking in the mirror and breaking yourself down. You have to believe in yourself and have self faith. You have to get out there and experience and believe... You can't do it. Nothing is impossible regardless to how many excuses you put up. Stop making them. Stop procrastinating. We were all put on this Earth for a reason and you(we) need to realize that you were two. Every one of us can build confidence. Every day we need to work at this. Again believe in yourself. Have faith. Everything again, what I explained is what confidence means to me.
  "
35081,"
   Have you had a job you absolutely hated? If so what did you learn from it?
  ","
  No. Not really. If I don't want to do a certain job I'm not going to do it. When I want a job, I'm going to 100% make sure that I do my best to get that job and let them know that I'm ready to work for them and do whatever they need me to. That's the kind of attitude you should have when you go into a job and you keep that attitude all the way through. Not on the first week or something. No slack. Hard work. Ambitions.
  
  But of course we all have jobs that we don't want to do even being not paid like certain important responsibilities and taking care of other people and yourself. Those kinds of jobs we have to do regardless of whether or not we want to do it and again I still don't mind doing it. It's life. That's how it works. We're not all going to like it 24/7.

  Essential workers are allowed at work.
  
  And honestly things have been slowly opening back up both here and in Canada I don't know about everywhere else. A lot of regular workers have been going back to work. Slowly. But they all have to wear masks and they have to do certain restrictions.  they still aren't allowing a lot of people in areas together. Appointments are only allowing one person in and I'm pretty sure only one person in the waiting rooms at a time. Places are under executive orders. They have to constantly check temperatures. Everyday and sometimes even throughout the day. People have to be tested before going back to work. They're kind of really strict about letting kids in public. And more. There are tons of restrictions and honestly there's not really any huge places opening back up yet or restaurants really. Any places that allow a ton of people at once in a room. Those kinds of places having really open back up yet.

   How do you keep your relationship hott with kids and married life???
  ","
  There are times when you have privacy and alone time. You need to work that kind of time in. That's just something you have to do with kids. And then maybe every three months go on a little 3 or 4 day trip with your partner and try to see if the kids, they can stay at a friend's house or a family member's house. But only with someone you trust. That's pretty understandable if you're just trying to spend some alone time with your partner. Just make sure you keep them with someone that will take care of them. It's good to go on trips with the whole family and sometimes it's nice just to go the two of you, to rekindle.
  
  And then every time you go to bed at home, as long as you don't have really really young children, maybe close your door. Don't lock it... just close it or lock it ? and just tell them to knock when they come to the door. And if you have older kids just tell them to keep an eye on their siblings for the next hour or so. You don't have to tell them what you're going to do. Just let them know if they need you to come knock on the door but only if you really need me and don't be hours... like the two of you. Don't be ours because you don't want to lose track of your kids because sometimes even teenagers can lose track of kids. You want to periodically check on everybody. That's how you should always be 100% of the time. Maybe check on them every 30 minutes or so.
  
  And then if sometimes you want to go on a date, get you a babysitter and make sure it's someone you trust. Or get the older children to watch the younger but make sure they're the right age. You don't want to leave 8 year old watching little young kids. You want your kids to at least be the age of 14 or 15 or something to watch younger kids and don't be gone for too long and make sure they have a back up & a trusted neighbor maybe to know that they're home alone and your number on speed dial and make sure you keep an eye on your phone. But don't do this every night do it every now and then. ?

  "
35198,"
   why is it important to respect other's beliefs and opinions? ???
  ","
  Just because that's just a nice thing to do. As I was growing up that's what I was always taught to do, one to respect. It's a respect thing and then just to avoid conflict and starting so much unnecessary drama. When you could just let it be. Also knowing how to socialize with any kind of person is nice and respectful and just looks good on you. I guess more or less it's just how you look. You don't want to seem like an ashhole. You want to seem like someone nice to talk to you. And it's not that you're sugar-coating anything or just being a sissy about it all it's more or less a respect thing. To get respect you must give it. A big lesson in life that we must all learn. Plus if they're not hurting anyone with their beliefs then I don't really understand what's the point of taking the energy out to be ugly or violent or just not accept them if they're not doing anything wrong to you. Something life-changing or threatening. I let them do them and I'll let me do what I want to.
  
  Even if you don't accept them just keep quiet about it and keep your words to yourself. Just treat them like a normal person and until they start shoving their beliefs on you then that's when you have every right to defend yourself. Especially if they start touching you. Your personal space is yours and no one else's. People are not always going to be accepted. And those types of people are going to have to understand that. This is the kind of world we live in.

But wasn't trying to insult me but was literally saying that I look like a child like the age of a small child. I know I'm short but wow. And I'm like how would I look like I'm 10 if I'm here? Strange. I most definitely don't look like I'm 10 there's no way. I've only have one person ever say that but I guess I must look like I'm probably in my twenties which I am but younger twenties maybe 19 or 20. You look like you're about 19 or 20 too

  Kind of but not really. Places have reopened up and have been a little lenient with letting people be together. Stuff has been slowly opening back up... But the numbers haven't really been chilling much here at all. Just going up. Cases and deaths.

   Do you like wearing hoodies?
  ","
  Sometimes I wear hoodies but honestly I only only two hoodies if that because I don't really wear them that much though I do like hoodies but I don't wear them that often because honestly I'm a really cool person and I love the cold. It would have to be freezing and raining for me to put a hoodie on. The other reason sometimes I wear a hoodie to protect my skin by putting an extra layer on. Especially if I'm working with wood and stuff with my arms and hands being exposed. I find wearing a hoodie is a good way to protect yourself. Also I wear a hoodie when I'm riding four wheelers and motorcycles. Helps to protect me from the wind shear.

   Do you have a preference of Drinking Water ? How you feel about boiling TAP water
  ","
  I don't mind drinking water, even TAP sometimes.. but you need to be careful on what you drink. I took a class on this in school. How water is process, purified(cleaned) and then where it comes from. What they do to get that water. And in the process that it takes from the sky, to the ground, in humans and then of course... the cycle goes on and on. We really need to be careful with what we drink because honestly there's different types of bacteria, toxins, pesticides and even acid that can be in the water at times. Some are more rare than others found in water but especially in your TAP. TAP water is completely unexpected. One day you can have a ton of bacteria in it and the next day it could be near to clean. That's why it is usually better just to make sure that you try to boil the water ot maybe checking the news on what's in the water that day. Being from cities and towns, this is what we had to do growing up because sometimes our water... would be contaminated and it wasn't drinkable and you had to boil your water at times. Or you had to go to the store and buy some distilled water or order big old gallons of water that you could drink out of. Eventually that water will catch up to you that contaminated water and it can make you sick. Sometimes immediately and sometimes it takes a couple days and it can get to you. It's not all mostly a huge deal but at the same time you don't want to be drinking some kind of bacteria to water that's going to make you have some sort of a disease or make you sick. I've always been aware of what I'm drinking in the water or at least try. Try to boil my water. I do that even today. Have always followed this. You should take some time to research this yourself. It's quite intriguing actually. You think water is just water until you really find out what the process it goes through.

  ","
  Idk who wrote this. But this is so true. I 100% agree with this because some of my really good friends have found themselves a girl and every now and then I get one... like one of their girls don't want them to hang out with nobody. I was just talking about this with another friend. I think it's funny that some of these girls don't want their men hanging out with other men or other women, NOBODY. You should want them to hang out with other people and be good to them, especially other women, because they have to treat you good at the end of the day and if they're treating other women bad and they're not going to treat you bad at the end of the day? And you want them to be good with other people. You can land really good jobs and make really good friendships with people that way. That's how life works. You supposed to build each other up not break each other down. Especially if you're the same sex. Girl should bring girls up and men should bring men up not break one another down. I totally agree with this. Sorry for your frustration to whoever is causing your rant. But I feel you 100% on this tho. Real statement for sure. Whoever you are. ✔

  Try to find ways to relax. Take a warm shower with some kind of lavender in the shower. Lavender can make you more sleepy and make you relax. Maybe talk to your doctor about having issues falling asleep. You made me having insomnia problems. Sometimes give me a little something to drink and help you go to sleep. Try to find something that covers your eyes when you go to sleep and get comfortable. Maybe change your sheets. Maybe I just the temperature in the room maybe you're too cold or hot when you go to sleep. Try to work socks. Try not to wear socks. Maybe want something before going to sleep and maybe it will make you a little tired. Turn off all lights in your room and you don't leave anything on.

   How would you end homelessness?
  ","
  There are places that encourage homeless people to work and they even pick them up and supply them clothes with their 1st paycheck (This is honestly with a lot of jobs do regardless of me being homeless. They make you pay for your uniforms through your 1st check.) that they make which is only honestly half of their first paycheck. Or really just depends on how mich you make at 1st. Then for transportation they only make them pay $10 out of their paycheck to come get them a week. By bus usually.  so that's a good way to end some people from being homeless. Completely get rid of homelessness? Eh can't because some people live on the streets and want to be homeless. You'd be surprised. Then from the job... I would start working my way up and getting small things at a time and giving me the things that I needed and then I would slowly start saving and getting contacted with people that could help me. Trying and having faith and cleaning yourself up a little bit. All it takes.

   I was called creep by 10 people today on ask fm. Why does this happen to me ?
  ","
  Iiiii don't know...
  
  Maybe try not to come off as a creepy Vibe? I don't know. Some people just like to be ugly.
  
  I think it's funny how I sent out a thing saying, ""Happy Mother's Day,"" to people and then in ""()"" I put... (you don't have to answer, just ignore especially to the people that don't have moms... my apologies there..)
  
  Then was like... Say a little something about your mom here if you'd like too. (Even for the people that lost theirs ya know? Trying to be understanding towards them too. Try to be nice. And SENSITIVE and caring to them also.)
  
  And then I think I even said Happy furbaby Mother's Day to the people that have fur babies and pets! Cause they can count too. Kinda.. pets are like part of the family and like kids to some.
  
  ...and have a great day basically in some way I put it like that. I can't remember EXACTLY exactly what I said, but it was something along the lines above but more summarized then how I put above.
  
  And then someone anonymously wants to come on my page and tell me I'm insensitive even though I put all that extra stuff saying my apologies to anyone that doesn't have a mom or lost their mom. I think that's hilarious. When I put ignore and then I even apologized in the question because I don't know who has a mom on here and doesn't? I don't know about y'all fully. So they should automatically assume that I don't know any better? because I don't know all of you personally personally.
  
  I think the question was fine to ask/say.
  
  They got angry. ? When they should *appreciate* regardless of what situation is going on in their life because I innocently I'm/was trying to be nice in saying Happy Mother's Day.
  
  Calling me insensitive? ? when I was in the question being sensitive. ? I think that person should work on their jumping the gun moments. Foooor sure. Cause they know what my intentions where. And so did the other 600 people I sent the question did too also.
  
  Sad what kind've people we have in this world. ?? Reeally interesting.

  Yeah that's really sad. During long-distance you have to keep constant communication. Me and my husband were in front of your long distance relationship and as I said before we kept in communication constantly. Always video chatting and calling each other and playing video games together and every now and then throughout the year going to see one another when we could. If you break that communication then a lot of questions arise and you wonder what's going on with the other person because they're not talking with you and informing you with what's going on in eating you and checking in with you. That's part of a relationship and if they're not giving you the same back that you're trying to give them then what's the point right?

  Maybe. But it can be tons of different things. But it's most definitely better for you to move on. Not good for them to be not speaking to you at all especially if you guys were close at one point and you've been trying to show your feelings to them. No one should be ignored when they're showing feelings like that. They should be at least told why they're not talkin back even if they have been busy or something.  all this covid-19 stuff is just been having people secluded and not really wanting to talk to people lately. So I hope it's just not that because then they could be making a mistake. But more than likely they ended up finding someone or there's just not wanting to talk for some odd reason. Kind of strange. Sorry that's happening to you. Hopefully things work out. Hope I helped.

  As long as you know the content and you know what you're doing and you can explain it right off the bat to somebody then you should do just fine. Try practicing this method.

   My hair is falling, any ideas on how to stop it?
(I think it’s because of stress)
  ","
  Try to lay off doing so much for the next few weeks. Just take it easy and slow. Don't brush your hair too hard and wash it very delegate. I wouldn't blow dry or straighten it for the next few weeks either. Just be really careful with your hair for the next few weeks. Try to think positive. Eat more foods that are energizing. Stay hydrated. Visit your doctor and ask them if they can recommend anything for you. Look up remedies online to help speed up hair growth or to stop stress. There's definitely no reason to be stressed out. I know that there's a lot going on but look around you and what you've got. You're alive. Cheer up and I hope things get better for you.

   Have you ever accidentally cracked your phone's screen? ? ?
  ","
  Yeah. I have a few times. Only one time I had to immediately get it fixed. I had an iPhone and I dropped it maybe a few feet from the ground (2 feet? Maybe 3? but it was concrete and it just shattered... the screen. I tried calling my mom after trying to see if she could come get my phone and get it fixed quick and I had glass all in my finger. It sucked. That was the only time I ever messed up my phone really bad. Other times I have cracked my screen but it was minor and it wasn't an iPhone. Just the only thing I didn't really like about the iPhone. They were just so breakable. You had to get a really good case to protect them. I do like iPhone though don't get me wrong. It's just that's the only thing I didn't like about iPhone is that the phones just broke so easily out of the case.
  
  My phone now it only has a few cracks, but it's actually a protective tempered glass screen. So if I was to take it off my phone screen would be completely fine. I just need to replace the tempered glass. ?

  Cleaning.
  
  I'm definitely a super clean person.. I honestly think that's not a bad trait.
  
  But I'm not like stupid about it, but I do just like... to be cleaned? Clean is good. Clwan is organized. Being organized is good. You know where everything is. Without having to look at it in a minute. You know where that item is. Because it's clean and organized. Having the environment around me clean makes me feel great. Doing it, cleaning it. Feeling cleaned. Feels good. Just at least normally clean is good.
  
  I walk into some stores and look around and just wonder how long has it been since they mopped? Or just wipe something down? Or... wow.. what is that smell? And then look around just a second and go... what is that on the floor? and/or how long has it been there? Why? It goes to show the kind of people in the environment if they don't see that that is wrong. If something is wrong. If they think all of that is normal and okay then... okay... it just makes you think? What does their house look like? Do I even want to go there next? Let's try to moderately be as least normally clean. At least for our help. And other people that comes through. Let's mind other people. Reapect. ?

Garlic cilantro parsley bay leaves Sage Rosemary basil Etc. Different types of chili powders come in their own powder red pepper chips. Dry bell pepper chips. Tony chachere's different levels of slap ya Mama seasonings. And yes that's the name of a seasoning we use down there LOL slap ya momma Cajun seasoning. Of course cayenne pepper regular pepper salt. different forms of sea salt. Pink salt. Tenderizer. Different types of bouillon in a powder form. And honestly this is just a few. But of course we don't use all of these are just all kinds of types of seasonings and spices we use. Whether they be fresh or pre-packaged. Homegrown and grinded down. Just depends on the day.

  I mean it's just another step you take in life. There's not really a difference honestly other than the fact you're just taking your relationship to another level. There's some things you can't do when you're just in a relationship. You have to be married to be able to do alot of stuff. Like on paper. Talkin about together. Depends on what country you're in and what area also. Some countries allow you to do more when you're just in a relationship and it doesn't really matter if you are married or not but some countries you have to be married to do a lot of different things and then some countries when married you don't have a lot of opportunities and it's not really like? Yeah.. Worth it. It's kind of hard to explain in text. But that's the best way I can.

   17. Are any of you friends a bad influence on you?
  ","
  Nope. If they do stuff like that I cut them out immediately. I have been friends with some for a long time and have to cut them out. Of course I gave them warnings and told them and have to talked to them in advance but if they're going to keep doing the bad habits that they're doing or hanging out with the bad people that they are then I'm going to veer away from them. I do not want those influences in my life. And I'm talking about drugs, them hanging out with people that are really really the wrong people to hang out with and just... bad things can end up happening to you. Very dangerous life risks type situations that they keep putting you in. Extremely dangerous type stuff. Nothing stupid small and petty. And we're not talking about things that I'm just scared of and that are quote on quote fun. We're talking about things that are literally going to actually get me killed. That is not cool. And making those types of things I haven't are very smart in life.

  Pitbulls are not all bad or mean dogs. Just like any other dog when you raise them that's the way they will ask. You have to be hard on them and teach them right.

  We all want everything to go back to normal. You guys need to get out and do stuff outside. Just make sure you don't do it in groups of people or around people you don't know. Take time to get away from one another. It's always good to spend time with each other but if you're all in the same space constantly looking at each other and talking to each other will of course you're going to get tired of each other. You need time and breaks away from people no matter how much you get along or not.

   Innocent until proven guilty? 

Or do you think they should prove their innocence?

 ....Why?
  ","
  I mean of course because everybody has a story. They know if they're in the right or wrong. A lot of people get convicted or told that they did something wrong when they didn't. Some people are in jail for doing absolutely nothing wrong just because they lost a court when the actual truth is they have done nothing wrong. It's not always the case but it's definitely something that has happened a couple of times. People should always be able to testify in court. Try their best to fight their way. But honestly if you did something wrong you honestly should just come out with it and accept the consequences. But if you did nothing wrong then you absolutely have every right to defend yourself in court. I most definitely would. I wouldn't want to be locked up for 15-20 years for doing nothing wrong. That's pretty much ending your life.

you have a favorite  products for  makeup ...?!
  ","
  I use a lot of random products. I don't try to focus on types I just try to to afford get something I can afford. I can wrok with just about any type pf makeup. Because makeup is just so much. I like to go to the cheap stores where they have makeup that they aftermarket and drop down to like one or two dollars that is usually like $15 or more.
  
  So instead of spending hundreds of dollars I only spend about $10. For the same type of product.
  "
36230,"
   Bella how do you care about your hair ?...?!
  ","
  I don't wash it too too often.
  
  Because for one lice are attracted to really really dirty or really really clean hair and I don't want to thin my hair out and washing it a lot will do that. it'll also cause a lot of baby hairs on your forehead because the hair is breaking. I try not to put too much stuff in my hair other than shampoo products and conditioning. When I do wash my hair I try to shampoo it twice very well. I use scalp shampoo for my scalp and then I use different shampoo for my length and then I use conditioner twice and I let it sit in my hair 5 to 10 minutes apart. Then don't wash all of the conditioner out and leave a little little bit in your hair so when you go to brush your hair after, not only is it easy but it also leaves a really good shine and a good smell in your hair. But you wash out most of the conditioner because you don't want to be too oily. I use a detangling wet brush so I don't rip all my hair out and I'm very delicate with brushing my hair. I do not blow dry my hair because too much heat can break hair easily and damage it. I very rarely straighten my hair. And I try to keep it away from really harsh breezes because it can cause really difficult knots to get out in your hair. Having really bad knots in your hair can cause you to rip out your hair. You want to brush your hair two or three times a day and keep the knots out of it. When you go to sleep at night usually put up on top of head in a bun because when you go to sleep the back of your head can collect really bad knots. The only other thing that I put in my hair sometimes is hair perfume but I honestly try to stay away from that.
  
  When I go to my hair stylist which is a very close family member and friend inwhich is pretty much the only person I've ever let touch my hair. I am very picky with who does my hair. She hooks me up always. I keep my natural hair color except the only thing that I color is my underneath front of my hair which we call them peekaboos. Love getting that!

  We wanted a really big wedding but we weren't able to have a huge wedding under certain circumstances but we are going to have another wedding in the future when we renew vows and we will have more people there.

  We have one bathroom in our house and I clean it rapidly throughout the week. Every day I probably clean the bathroom at least once. I also try to keep the bathroom and the whole house clean because sometimes we do have unexpected guests and I want them to be able to go to the bathroom and use the private space comfortable
  
  Aside from a few things that are probably a little dirty they don't take but maybe a few minutes to clean. What the average house would probably have on a daily basis but like I said before I try my very best to keep our house at a t and cleaned and tidy because I don't like stuff scattered because if I want to find something I want to know where it's at immediately I'm looking for

   how often do you wash dishes?
  ","
  Honestly right after we use something we try to clean it and if we do leave something in the sink we clean everything by the end of the day. Before we go to sleep that's a rule in the house everything in the sink must be clean.
  
  We use the dishes pretty frequently throughout the day so we could wash dishes anywhere from four to eight times a day. Just depends.

36286,"
   how often do you clean your bedroom?

  Our bedroom actually stays pretty cleaned, organized and tidy. Everyday we're always cleaning up something or cleaning something. But once a week we probably vacuum and dust and clean all kinds of different things. Sometimes we vacuum more than once a week. Even two or three times. Maybe more. Just depends. We steam clean the carpets very often. But like I said throughout the we were constantly cleaning.

   What are you opinions on having children before marriage? ? I think it's totally fine, I mean it's their life, they get to decide what to do. But some (mostly old) people are really stubborn and actually think of this as a sin (??) ?
  ","
  Nah.. I think... If you know that you're both ready to raise a child and you know you can do it and you both are mature and ready, like I said, then I don't see a problem in it anf having kids before marriage. But I would most definitely make sure that all the signs are safe and right before having kids with the other person. Just be careful more or less because you want that father and mother both around for that child. You have to think of the child.
  
  I myself just like to have kids after getting married. But if I knew for sure that me and him were both ready before then yes I would have kids. I don't judge anyone for anything they do. Even if they break up. Just try to work things out for the child(kids)
  
  I respect older folks for their values and morals but at the same time you can't judge people if they know what they're doing. Anything's possible. Someone before marriage could have five kids then get married and live on forever with their 5 children. You can't judge a book by it's cover, cuz everyone is different. Some people are capable and some are not.

  I mean it's not one or two things... I mean it's hundreds or even thousands of different things that have happened. I will mention a few.
  
  I have experienced many many times doors opening and closing with no wind or any type of draft or anyone opening or closing it. 100% unexplained and strange. Even door slamming and opening and closing multiple times in a row.
  
  Having Electronics on us completely drained of their battery and it's more than one thing. It's like five or six different things everything just drains battery. Everything was fully charged not even minutes ago.
  
  Drastic temperature changes. Walking into rooms where the temperature drops almost 20 to 30 degrees sometimes. When it's not even cold outside and there's no air conditioning in the house.
  
  I have legitimately witnessed and seen with other people around me things being thrown. Sometimes being thrown at us and sometimes just being thrown somewhere or maybe just across the room. No explanation, nobody touching it, nothing pushing it causing it to fall... no vibrations of any sort... no small earthquakes or anything lile that. Just really really strange crazy scary. Yeah..
  
  Me and the team have caught apparitions orbs have heard many disembodied voices that were completely and utterly unexplained.
  
  Some people have appeared to have been attacked choked get nauseous sometimes on investigations. Some people get pushed and tripped..
  
  We have seen chairs movie.
  
  And sooo much more.
  
  This is just a few things that has happened to me and a few other people that have been with us and have experienced the same thing at the same time

   what have you learned about yourself during this quarantine?
  ","
  Honestly we're used to being quarantined since we're out on the countryside and then we're used to always spending time with each other and entertaining each other because sometimes it gets boring out here. We go outside and do things around the house go fishing, hunting. Just depends. Gardening. And then I'm used to being away from a lot of friends and family for a few months at a time or longer. Just depends. We plan to go back and forth and visit. The only thing that has changed honestly is the fact that I haven't been able to really do a bunch of traveling trips which is okay. It's different, but nothing impossible to do. But I have definitely seen other people learn from this, because a lot of people just don't spend time with their siblings and their kids. And sometimes it's not even their fault. They're having to work so much just to be able to pay the bills around the house. Instead of being able to be at home resting and spending time with family.
  
  Then lot of people have been really agitated and ill coming into our store for no reason and taking it out on us when they honestly should be appreciating people that are working in retail because honestly we could be closed.  We are being so exposed to all of this stuff and trying our best to keep ourselves safe. Same thing to the other essential workers that are around a lot of people. I've always been very clean. I've always washed my hands a lot during the day. My hands are always really dry because of that reason so I try to use a lot of lotion. I have always kept my house cleaned and my environment clean and our vehicles cleaned but it's just kind of funny watching everybody else freak out and magically start cleaning out of nowhere like they have never cleaned before. Over the time of living in my life I have gained a lot of patience for things so I'm just patiently waiting for this to end. Especially considering I can't wait to go traveling and see my family and friends in Louisiana again! ?

36559,"
   While driving your car, has someone in a different car ever sped up when you tried to pass them but then slowed down when you gave up passing them, then sped up again when you tried to pass them again?
  ","
  They don't want to do that to me and my husband. My husband works for the sheriff's department so it would not go well for that person. Cuz that's very against the law.
  
  But they wouldn't be able to do that because we would be going too fast for them to be able to keep up when passing. And then of course go back to the same speed that the limit is supposed to be at. But of course you have to go a little fast to be able to get around them.

  Watch them make fun of the person in front of them while the person in front of them can clearly hear everything they're saying... for no reason... Just to be ugly... The person did absolutely nothing to them. And there's nothing wrong with a person either?  the one that they're making fun of. Some people just feel entitled to do whatever they want and if someone has a problem with it then they're going to hurt them, fight them? I never really understood the purpose of being ugly and rude for no reason? Some people are just... Idk ?
  
  Another thing that I can't stand is when I see them making fun of an elderly person or hurrying an elderly person when they're not even actually going that slow?? But people that have had prior strokes and stuff can't help it? ? and have to go slow... so I honestly why hurry them? Let them take time. Don't rush people because I know that they don't want to be rushed and the second that they get rushed ohh! there's a problem!

  Sometimes. But right now with this coronavirus stuff I've been trying to wear as less as I can except for my wedding ring because I just don't want to get it dirty and contaminated and have to wash it all the time. So I'm just being very careful honestly.
  
  But I love to wear my engagement and wedding ring at the same time on the same finger.
  
  I also like to wear this bracelet that was blessed by a Greek priest or Bishop I think. It definitely makes me feel good when I wear it and brings me luck I find. Of course considering it was blessed. Brings me protection.
  
  I also like to wear a few of these support bracelets. For a few people that passed or are fighting for their lives.  I wear one for my husband's best friend he passed away. I wear one that is from one of my favorite Rappers that's an upcoming rapper. And then I have a few others that I wear sometimes including one that my mother got me for Christmas when I was around 16 years old? I can't exactly remember I think I was actually 17 maybe? It's a Minecraft bracelet and I love it. She actually had this customized for me. So I find it very special that she went out of her way to get this for me. ❤
  
  I really like to wear my class ring. But as I said before I don't worry right now. For certain reasons.
  
  And then there's a few other bracelets that I like to wear that my sister got me.
  
  I have a pinky ring that I wear that my husband got me and I have a promise ring that my husband got me that I like to wear every now and then.
  
  I have this necklace that has a cross on it that my aunt got me a while back that I like to wear also but I don't work too much because I don't want to wear it out. It is actually made by someone across the world in Africa I believe. It's a beautiful cross necklace. I love it so much.

  Yes because in your life you should always want to strive to do better even if you already have reached your goal(s) you still keep going because at least you could try to help others along the way of their ride to success.

   Flashback Friday Q : Do you still remember how did you know about ASKfm? What made you join and keeps you active on this platform?
  ","
  A very very long time ago I think I either joined for someone that was on here and I just wanted to go back and forth with questions with them and a few other people or if I just came on here by myself and join them and just wasn't very active because I didn't know anyone or how to use the app. I honestly can't remember it's been so long but all I know is when I got active I fell in love with this app because I am able to talk to people from all over the world and that's what I love. Different culture and languages. This app is just very different. Very open to the world. It really goes to show a lot of the things they say on the news is it anything. There are nice people from anywhere in the world within the country. Of course there has been things happen all over the world and they different countries all countries honestly. There are good people and bad people everywhere and in all parts of the world. But when you really look in between the lines and see the people oh, there are more innocent kind people them bad apples. There could be a dozen of bad apples in a population of 1000 people and they want to go ahead and label it all bad when it's really not. People really need to give things a chance and find out for themselves before judging something or someone. Because I don't think that you would like it if someone did this to you especially if your 100% innocent and have done nothing wrong. I think anyone and everyone on this app that I have met and that I follow or follows me. Y'all really do shed light in my life. I enjoy each and everyone's company. You guys do so much for me. I'm between answering your questions and asking you guys questions and seeing your answers. I love it all. Keep sticking around guys! Because I appreciate all of you! Thank you.

  I had one friend that I was friends with for the longest but I ended up not being friends with her anymore because of certain things that happened. She started hanging out with really bad influential type people and started lying and stealing and just seem to be believing everything they were telling her and after she ended up learning her lesson in the end but I just stopped being friends with her because I had a feeling that it was going to keep repeating and I didn't want to be there for the and be influenced wrongly. So it stopped being friends for a reason. Good reasons. I tried to help her and take her along but there was nothing I could do about it. I had to keep myself safe. Make the right decision there. But I have known tons of people throughout my life for over a decade or more or two decades. But me and my best friend my husband have been together for 6 years. Very happily together.

They raised me with my parents. My grandparents are the most generous folks you could ever meet in your life. They dedicated 32 or more years of their life volunteering helping in saving lives. Wonderful kind souls. I am honored to have them as my grandparents because they're such wonderful kind people. I just miss their presence.

  At the moment I honestly don't think I'm able to really go to many places at all. We're all on quarantine. But you can look a lot of these places up online and check out prices. Random prices of different places in the USA at these different stores. You can literally look them up online or call somebody even. I definitely recommend that. Hopefully I was some kind of help. Sorry I'm not able to do than what you need. I live a pretty good distance away from it. I live out on the countryside. I only live near one or two places. I think only one honestly. But it's still a good distance away. But like I said we're on quarantine. We're not really allowed to go out unless we need to go get groceries and they're honestly trying to tell us not to do that either. I also can go out to go to work. That's about it.

  I think magnet fishing should be allowed to do anywhere as long as it's not private land and people don't want you there. If you're just trying to clean the water out of them what is the big deal? You're trying to clean the environment and get in type of rust oil or Machinery out the water so it doesn't ruin the water. I honestly think this is quite wonderful.

Or get it back to the owner of the place.

  That all adults were like heroes. I felt that... not more less thought that... just kinda expected it. But I shortly found out that no even adults make mistakes and that some of them are extremely dangerous and stuff. I was raised knowing the good in people and I guess I ended up discovering some of the horrible things growing up. I'm sure this is how it works for all of us. We start to realize the realization in the world. Come to terms with it. But was raised to know some of them but more positively raised to know the good more in people. It's just unfortunate to find out that there are so many people that have lived on this Earth for 40 50 60 70 years and they still want to do violent horrible things to human beings. You think after all that time they have learned their lesson to be good but that's not the realness in it... look on it.. I guess. That's how it should be but it's not.

  I know Concrete Angel is so sad. That's all makes me cry every single time. Especially the music video. If you've never seen it. Go and look it up and you most likely will cry. Make sure you look up the music video. The saddest song in the entire world! And I think it's based on a true story. ???

I have been a fan since I was about six years old. I'm 24 and still a die-hard fan of Avril Lavigne. She is everything to me. Such a wonderful soul with a beautiful voice. ?

  My most favorite type of sandwich is a fried shrimp po boy sandwich. That is the best! So good! I also like a meatball sandwich and I like a chicken teriyaki sandwich with pepper jack cheese on it.

   May I ask where did you buy your mask? Was it easy to find? Doea your husband wear mask too? ☺
  ","
  I got it from a Lowe's around where I live at a little bit ago.. we got it about a month a go. Maybe about 3 weeks ago. We had to ask someone where they were at because they had a designated spot for them. You can find them on the paint area at Lowes. At some hardware stores and stuff I'm sure they would have them too. But I have one and husband has one in his grandmother has one. My husband's is green. And my husband wears his when he has to at work. There is a filter in it. You change it out every now and then. And I spray the outside of my mask after I use it during the day. Wash it when it's necessary and then put it back into its little quarantine bag.

   I have a cough... What do you think should I drink?
  ","
  Absolutely anything warm. You need warm foods. If you have flem in the back of your esophagus and in your nose you need warmth to loosen it and get rid of it. You might start coughing more but that means that it's working. Twice a day you should be drinking and eating something hot. That ain't drinking two different things that are hot and eating two different things that are hot. Soups are hot. Chicken broth is hot. Chili is hot. Price can be hot but it might hurt your throat. Warm tea. Coffee. Most definitely drink warm things right now even if you have to heat up some water and drink it. Grits are hot.
  
  Also take you a very warm shower and sit in the shower with steam around you for at least 20 minutes. Do this twice a day. You were going to cough more but this is actually working. Is loosening the mucus and trying to speed up the process of a mucus cough.
  
  Most definitely take care of yourself now before you get to prolonged

   At what point in a relationship do you think is the best time ot move in together?
  ","
  I think honestly whenever both of you are ready. Don't ever hurry anything in a relationship. You will regret it in the end. You want to take it slow because really special relationships are the best when first starting. I wish I could meet my husband all over again because it was absolutely wonderful. Fighting the battle to be together. Fighting the distance.

   Are you spending time with your husband and child? Post a picture of you and family?
  ","
  At the moment my husband is at work but when he comes home we're supposed to spend time together and then cook with it. We're supposed to go outside and do some yard work. And then we're thinking about doing a little cleaning around the house. And we don't have any kids. We do own two dogs and then we have his Maw maw's dog. And we play with them and spend time with them no matter what happens. Even before all this quarantine stuff we always spent time with them.

   Have you ever used a dating app? What was your experience?
  ","
  No. I've never used a dating site. Never had to use one. I kind of just let people flow in naturally. A lot of people that I've seen get on dating sites a lot of people take advantage of them want to play games and just hang around for a few days and then disappear. But that's not how everyone is on dating sites but that's just what I have seen.. So I've always just really try to avoid them sites altogether.

   Wowww that’s a long answer?I’ll give you full marks for that?✨??cuz everything you said makes sense and it’s genuinely correct...

It’s a great thing that you are helping your friend through his hard time?✨?
  ","
  Well it's a very serious question to answer and to explain properly because a lot of people just only burn bridges with their exes.  A lot of people just run away from everything that has happened wrong in their lives. Whether they broke up over something extremely small or they broke up over something really big, people just want to cut all ties. Sometimes that's not always what needs to be done but people find that the better way out.
  
  Sometimes you learn a lot from your exes and the other way around that ex can learn from you. No one is better than another person. We are all here to learn on this Earth. Honestly people need to perceive it as that. But everyone is different.
  
  Just my honest answers really. I thank you for your compliments. I really do try.

  I really appreciate the kind and strong message that you are giving! It is definitely a hard time for everyone. All of this crazy sickness stay-at-home stuff. When we all want to get out and socialize and travel. Again I appreciate you Nikki! If anyone needs and wants to talk to, come to me and you too, Nikki. My DMs are open on herem Just make sure you put in your message to not post when you send me a message and I can talk back and forth. Wall to wall.
  
  Of course this goes out to everyone as long as the conversation is appropriate.

   How wonderful is it to be alive? Give me a good report.
  ","
  I feel absolutely wonderful for being alive because there are people that are not especially because of this covid-19 stuff. A lot of people are thinking it is funny and a joke and aren't staying at home quarantined and away from people that are at risk. When I honestly we all are at risk. Because some people are carriers. You could be having mild symptoms and not even realize it and you're carrying the virus and getting other people sick. Not just older people are. There are tons of people that are at the age of 10 15 20 30 that have the covid-19 virus as well as even infants babies. It's really sad and nothing to play around with and it is not funny. There are people that are not making it right now as we speak. It is sad to think... But I am very appreciative to be able to be alive and living other day. I do not take this for granted. I thank God everyday for being able to wake up and walking down this Earth. Because as I said before some people are not being able to be given that chance again.

  Sometimes some relationships are better to be left as friends. Sometimes you try to get into further ships with friends and it don't always happen correctly, so sometimes, you just go back to being just friends. Sometimes it doesn't go back to the same and sometimes it does and my case it worked. It's more or less... like with burning bridges. Is it really worth burning the bridge? Or is it worth being friends with them at all after? Because sometimes it's not. Better to go your separate ways. Or is it really that big of a deal of why you two broke up? Can you go back to being friends? All of these are the questions that you ask yourself. And as I said before, sometimes it's really easy to go back to being just friends and sometimes it's impossible and you just need to not talk to each other and cut all ties. I have one friend that I grew up with and we dated off and on for years but we never really understood why it would never work out but the reason later on we figured it out is because we were better off being just friends. So we are still friends but we don't talk everyday. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. It depends on what your intentions are with that friendship. And that's when trust comes in. Got to trust somebody when it comes to making friends with both girls and guys. That's life. Then control. All those old feelings aren't there anymore. Just friends type of feeling is there and only. It is possible. It is not impossible. Nothing is impossible. We are all independent people. We have the ability to do anything we set our minds too. We need to give ourselves more credit. Confidence. It plays a big role in our lives.
  
  My husband me and him are actually good friends. We check in on that old friend of mine because he is dealing with a lot. And as I said before we literally went back to just being friends. And honestly it's something to be proud of yourself about. Most people just want to run from things. I embrace my mistakes. No regrets.
