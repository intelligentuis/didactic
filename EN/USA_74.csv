  i'm fine with both !! i like answering questions about my own experiences with the coronavirus pandemic, as well as other questions that relate to something else entirely.
  "
396938,"
   The whole discover page here on ask and every other social media platform, in media in general, is all about the same topic. How do you feel about that? Do you find it annoying and wish that people would stop talking about it? Or do you find it interesting what other people add to the conversation?
  ","
  i don't mind the conversation about the coronavirus at all, tbh. i find it to be interesting, and i'm happy that people are discussing it and emphasizing staying inside & quarantining, because that's the safest thing to do rn.

  just cheese. sometimes i'll order pepperoni though.

   if your ex broke up with his gf and begged you to take him back and it was a mistake leaving you will you take him back or

  depends on how he words it and how he behaves, tbh. he isn't the type of person to ""beg"" or anything so this is fairly unrealistic to begin with anyway.

   If you're currently employed (or were until this pandemic) is this what you thought you'd be doing for a career at this stage in your life? If you're not employed, what career field would you like to belong to?
  ","
  honestly, i never thought i would live to see this age to begin with, so i never really set many expectations for myself when i was younger. i only knew that i wanted to spend my life writing and expressing myself through writing and art, which i suppose i've successfully done so far.

  currently sitting down, scrolling through social media, and debating on whether or not to play video games.
  "
396990,"
   If you were to die today what would you most regret not telling anyone?
  ","
  i'm pretty vocal with my feelings, so i can't think of anything significant.
  "
396991,"
   What would you consider as a perfect day
  ","
  waking up in a cabin amid the mountains and woods, going out to the porch with a steaming hot cup of coffee, watching the snow or rain fall while i drink my coffee, and then spend quality time with friends and/or a partner for the remainder of the day. we'd wander the forest, BBQ outside, have drinks together, sit outside of a campfire, and tell war stories until early morning hours.
  "
396992,"
   If you could wake up tomorrow and gain an ability or a quality what would  you choice and why
  ","
  i'd magically be ""cured"" of my mental illnesses.
  "
396993,"
   Is there any type of renovations that you were going to be doing soon around in your home? Inside or outside. Care to share?
  ","
  not really, no. we've all been talking about getting new furniture and a television for the living room, but we're all very low on cash right now, so it isn't plausible (nor the most important thing to do anyway).
  "
396994,"
   this coronavirus is trash . ?. just complaining ?
  ","
  my coworker's husband was tested two weeks ago & he *just* got the results back today. they were positive.
  
  since two weeks have passed, he's officially recovered, but that also probably means that my coworker herself had it too because after he got sick, she started feeling the same way. i'm so grateful that they're both fine now, it could have been so much worse for them.
  "
396995,"
   Do you like papaya?
  ","
  i've never tried it before.
  "
396996,"
   What do you find that you get judged most online for? Does this differ from what people in person have judged you for or continue to judge you for?
  ","
  i get judged most online for my gender, and political and social beliefs.
  
  i'm not sure if i'm judged IRL or not based on the above, because the only people i interact with are friends and coworkers.
  "
396997,"
   In what area did your opinion change a lot lately?
  ","
  about one month ago, i didn't see the coronavirus as a big deal -- however, that opinion quickly changed when i saw how fast it was spreading, how many people have passed away, and how exhausted hospitals and doctors are in light of this pandemic. it's a complete catastrophe.
  "
396998,"
   If you were told you would live forever, what would you change about your life?
  ","
  nothing in particular, but i would be disheartened that i would live forever. that seems like an awful existence.
  "
396999,"
   How are you all doing?
  ","
  i'm incredibly anxious and there's absolutely nothing i can do about it rn. :/
  "
397000,"
   What was the last thing to make you go wait what in confusion ?
  ","
  some of the anon questions i receive here.
  "
397001,"
   Boris Johnson got corona loool are you happy
  ","
  why would i be happy about that? lol. i also don't even live in the UK.
  "
397002,"
   i miss gym so much during lockdown and feel so gross and fat and unmotivated at home what abt you
  ","
  there are plenty of gyms offering free workout streams and classes on facebook & youtube that you can do at home (i know planet fitness and orange theory are two of them).
  "
397003,"
   What do you miss doing the most while everything is cancelled?
  ","
  i wouldn't necessarily say that i miss it really, because it's more of a luxury than anything else, but it would be nice to dine-in at applebees or a local taco joint and have some appetizers and happy hour drinks.
  "
397004,"
   What is something that is really popular now, but in 5 years everyone will look back on and be embarrassed by?
  ","
  tik tok dances.
  "
397005,"
   Are you single
  ","
  yes, i'm single.
  "
397006,"
   Diff anon but I agree. If it's an actual affair where they have feelings for the person or are actually trying to meet up with people, I would let them go but if it was a one time thing where they were just bored or whatever and just messing around I could let it go after I spoke to them.
  ","
  tbh, in the latter example, i still consider that to be unfaithful and i don't believe i would be apt to give them a ""pass."" i'm at a point in my life where i require a person to be wholly committed to me.
  "
397007,"
   understood, would you forgive that? if they didn't have feelings for the other people
  ","
  i already discussed this. i probably would break up with them, and it depends whether or not i would forgive them in the future.
  "
397008,"
   what if it was them purely sxxting other people and stuff like that
  ","
  that's still cheating in my opinion.
  "
397009,"
   say you find out they're chatting with other women online and stuff like that but never actually did anything in person, is that forgivable for you?
  ","
  depends on what they're saying & if they're making promises to one another. if my partner was saying that they loved the other person and was promising to meet them and whatnot, then i would simply break up with them because that's considered cheating in my eyes.
  
  forgiveness is another story. i'd probably forgive them over time, but that doesn't make the behavior okay.
  "
397010,"
   Would you forgive a cheater?
  ","
  depends on the particular circumstances, because i'm more apt to forgive rather than hold a grudge. however, that doesn't necessarily mean that i'll remain in a relationship with them.
  "
397011,"
   Is there anyone from your family is an artist?
  ","
  no, i don't believe so.
  "
397012,"
   some kids from young age can draw better in class than their peers. I think it’s a talent. When did start to draw?
  ","
  it's both, but you can also learn. i don't remember when i started drawing, but i'm sure i was a child.
  "
397013,"
   Is drawing and singing a born talent or it can be learned?
  ","
  they can most definitely be learned, yes. that's why there are many art classes and singing lessons available for those who wish to learn.
  "
397014,"
   How’s your self-quarantine going peeps? ?
  ","
  self-quarantining is going remarkably well !! i've been spending my time working from home, playing video games, and watching comedy shows. i miss seeing my friends, but i'm sure we'll all get together once this is all over with.
  "
397015,"
   What is your favourite flavour of tea... if you like tea at all that is
  ","
  i love white teas and green teas, of pretty much any flavor. i also enjoy jasmine tea and ginger tea.
  "
397016,"
   Do you like going to concerts or gigs?
  ","
  i love going to concerts and shows, but i rarely have the chance to do so.
  "
397017,"
   Do you have art on the walls of your house?
  ","
  we don't have any hanging yet, but we do own some art. i also have a piece of art hanging in my room that was commissioned as a gift for me -- my friend is an artist, so he painted it. :'))
  "
397018,"
   Do you like horror movies?
  ","
  i used to like horror movies when i was younger, but they raise my anxiety too much these days. my favorite movies back in the day were the texas chainsaw massacre, house of 1000 corpses, and the hills have eyes.
  "
397019,"
   Do you like fast food? what is your favourite kind to get?
  ","
  i like fast food, but i seldom order it. i like going to wendy's and getting their spicy chicken sandwich.
  "
397020,"
   ever had an abortion?
  ","
  this isn't really an appropriate question to ask someone on askfm right off the bat. however, the answer is no.
  "
397021,"
   Based on what you heard about foreign countries، Which country?
  ","
  i already said that i don't know which one i would dislike.
  "
397022,"
   Which foreign country do you dislike the most?
  ","
  i've only ever traveled abroad once, so i don't know any countries that i would dislike.
  "
397023,"
   Name something that really boils your pi$$? ??
  ","
  people who talk over me while i'm in the middle of speaking.
  "
397024,"
   How much has isolation changed your typical daily routine?
  ","
  it's actually changed it quite a bit -- instead of waking up around 7:00am, i'm waking up at 8:30am so that i can log into my laptop and begin working at 9:00am. i haven't driven in nearly a week because i've had no reason to, and i've been eating home-cooked meals more often than anything else because i want to save more money.
  
  i've been able to do regular household chores during the day instead of waiting until i'm home from work, which means i have more time after work to relax and do things i enjoy.
  "
397025,"
   When was the last time you typed using a computer keyboard and not a phone one? What about put putting pen to paper?
  ","
  i'm currently typing on my laptop's keyboard now. because i'm working from home, i have to use my laptop every day.
  
  i honestly can't remember the last time i wrote something out by hand, tbh. i haven't had a need for it in an extremely long time. i even write my grocery lists on my phone, haha.
  "
397026,"
   Have you started any new hobbies lately? What about new TV shows, started watching any?
  ","
  i haven't started any new hobbies, but i have been watching a lot of comedy shows on netflix. i watched two of bret kreischer's specials last night, ""the machine"" and ""secret time."" i was laughing so hard, and i highly recommend them !!
  "
397027,"
   Fav thing to do these days??
  ","
  sleep and watch television, mainly. i was playing video games for a few days in a row, but then i fell out of the habit.
  "
397028,"
   Why do guys like bidets? Are you one of them? ??
  ","
  i'm pretty sure bidets are popular everywhere else except in the united states, haha. we're the odd ones out.
  "
397029,"
   does incorrect grammar bother you?
  ","
  when i'm at work, it bothers me endlessly. when i'm editing my coworkers' writing, sometimes i'm amazed at how terrible their grammar is even though they went to college, lol.
  
  out of work, i couldn't care less about grammar.
  "
397030,"
   thank you so much, that really means a lot to me ? I hope you have a good night. please stay safe (physically AND mentally).
  ","
  thank you so much !! i'm keeping as safe as i can possible be, especially considering now new york is considered the ""epicenter"" of the virus. :/
  "
397031,"
   What does non biary? And what stories have you written?
  ","
  non-binary is my gender, and it means that i am neither a woman nor a man.
  
  i haven't written many stories, but i am a writer and editor for a publishing company as my occupation, and i also write poetry and personal essays in my spare time.
  "
397032,"
   Do you like Lana Del Rey???
  ","
  i like a few of her songs, yes. i used to listen to her back in 2012.
  "
397033,"
   What are your thoughts on how schools have shut down for covid-19?
  ","
  i believe it's warranted and necessary. college campuses and public/private schools in new york have been shut down for pretty much the entire month of march, from what i can remember. they're supposed to open april 1st, but i believe now they're reassessing the situation and wondering if they should stay closed until further notice.
  "
397034,"
   r u a feminist furthermore; r u a follower of the PC language?
  ","
  i don't ascribe to the label of ""feminist"" because i've detached myself from that particular community, but i do believe in equality and equity for everyone regardless of their sex, gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, ability/disability, etc etc.
  
  i use politically correct language for the most part, yes. there are certain words that are considered slurs to some groups, and it's advisable to simply pick another word to use.
  "
397035,"
   thank you. I honestly never thought to look at the liquor stores like that... but when you put it like that, it really does make sense. my father lost his battle with this only just this year, the first week of 2020, and it still really hurts because I was closer with them than my mom... but as 1/2

  (cont) ... nihilistic as this is, with all this COVID shit going on, I'm just glad he's not in pain anymore. I know that if he were alive right now, watching the news like he always does, he would just be downing bottle after bottle to try and keep himself numb. I'm glad that around the time he passed, he d*ed believing that one day, he would truly beat this. he is why I'm going to school to become an addictions counsellor for youth. if I can save even one person from this disease, it will all be worth it.

  i really admire your strength and dedication through all of this. that's probably going to be a very difficult, yet rewarding profession & i know already that you're going to be a brilliant counselor. ♡
  "
397036,"
   when’s the last time you helped a friend in need?
  ","
  my coworker was very upset about something the other day, so i talked her through the feelings and she felt better after we discussed everything.
  
  if there were no quarantine rules, i would have gone to her house and hung out with her. but unfortunately that isn't safe right now.
  "
397037,"
   Are you afraid of being your true self around others? Why?
  ","
  no. i'm at a point in my life where if i feel as if i cannot be myself around friends, then they're not deserving of being in my life at all.
  "
397038,"
   Do you feel anger or anguish when you are very hungry?
  ","
  no, i just get very drowsy and lightheaded.

   1/3 I live in England and drinking here is more than just the cultural norm, it's almost a way of life. my first sip of beer was at 5 years old, I'd drink a small glass of wine during special occasions at 8, I'd drink casually with friends at 12... interestingly enough, I've only been drunk 3x in-
  ","
  (cont) ... my life, and actually don't even really enjoy drinking that much, but I can't say the same about my family, or most of my friends. drinking from very young ages, almost no one bats an eye. little kids get into the liquor cabinet? eh, they're just kids, they'll survive. it wasn't until I went and had my father and 3 of my friends d*e from alcoholism, when I was really like, holy sh*t, alcohol is one of the most dangerous dr*gs out there, yet it's the only one that's actively encouraged and normalized in society.
  
  --
  
  yes, i wholeheartedly agree with you. i'm also sorry for your losses, that must have been so difficult. :/
  
  alcohol *is* one of the most dangerous drugs, and the thing is that most people don't ever look at it as a drug at all. it's one of the most lethal addictions, and alcoholism is honestly the reason why right now liquor stores are considered ""essential stores"" -- if alcoholics cannot get their alcoholic, they're going to go into lethal withdrawals and potentially die.
  "
397043,"
   What’s something you’ve gotten into//started enjoying recently? I’ve been on a baking/cooking binge lately!

  not everyone has the privilege of getting a loan to begin with, or obtaining a good education in high school to be accepted to college, etc etc. i felt very fortunate because it was my initial means of getting away from everything that was hurting me.

   ? ? ? yesssss.....the normalization of alcohol consumption is what kept me in denial for so damn long
  ","
  it's something that's definitely not talked about often, and i'm pretty sure it's a worldwide dilemma. i've definitely noticed it within myself because i have some friends who encourage it unconsciously (like if i text someone to daydrink, they'll be enthusiastic about it instead of asking me why i want to in the first place).
  
  i've most definitely used alcohol as a crutch in the past, as you well know, but ever since i moved out of my parents' house i haven't felt compelled to get drunk at all. and when i do drink these days, it's light and casual.

  ","
  lately, it's been chinese people overall -- they've been facing so much discrimination due to the coronavirus, when it isn't warranted at all. just because someone is of a specific race or ethnic group doesn't mean they're responsible for the outbreak, and to treat a chinese person differently or poorly is incredibly wrong.
  
  this actually goes for most people of the asian population, because i know some people who have been discriminated against for being asian even though they're not even chinese.
  "

   Would you prefer it if your government decided to go for herd immunity?
  ","
  i just briefly skimmed through an article that discussed the UK contemplating instituting a ""herd immunity"" approach to combat the virus, but it was met with a lot of criticism from physicians and virologists. most times, herd immunity is created through a widespread vaccine, but we simply do not have one at this time.
  
  i don't know how that would translate in the united states, particularly because the health care system is already f*cked and chances are, it would only make things worse. i think social distancing is the best bet in the meantime, and we should listen to medical professionals until they say otherwise.
  "
397119,"
   It's been almost 3 months since we broke up and he found someone new in no time! He gave her all the love and care that he never gave me even when I gave him everything? he broke my heart! This should mean he never loved me, right?
  ","
  three months is a decent amount of time to move on from an old relationship. it doesn't mean he never loved you, because his new feelings towards his new relationship will never negate the feelings he had for you in your old relationship. there are different types of love.
  
  my advice is to simply try to move forward, whether it's through finding another partner, spending more time with friends and family, engaging in a new hobby, etc etc. life isn't solely about love and relationships, and it can be enlightening to realize that you do not need another person to feel whole.

  it's made virtually no difference in my behavior. if anything, i have more freedom and free time to answer questions thoughtfully, but i still have the same tolerance as i did before.
  "
397126,"
   Do you think most people want to life to go back to normal or are they happy to stay quarantined?
  ","
  i know that most people want the coronavirus to run its course and be handled, so that they can all return to their normal lives. quarantining seems easy, but we also need social interaction in order to thrive (which is why the new zoom applications to interact with friends and family is important!).
  
  in addition, you have to think of the essential workers who are working double overtime, not getting paid any more than they usually would, and are coming into contact potentially with the virus on a daily basis. i know for sure those workers want this to be over with.

   do you thing the saying “money comes and goes.” it’s true or no?
  ","
  depending on each individual's circumstance, yes and no. for those with low incomes, they value money because it's essential for their survival, so they're more apt to hold onto any money they earn in the case of an emergency. in those circumstances, money does not ""come and go"" because they cannot afford to otherwise.
  
  for some other people, the saying is true. money can come and go, because if you do have a stable job, you're always going to have a reliable source of consistent income. sometimes it's good for certain people to splurge on things because it makes them happy -- that money will return. it's part of the reason why i like spending money on experiences rather than physical goods.

  ","
  yeah, as long as they're taking necessary precautions. most of my friends are considered essential workers, so they're still going to work every day and remaining safe.
  
  people need to remember that it's fine to leave your house when necessary, like for grocery shopping or picking up medication or doctor visits (if they're not doing it over the phone). but you have to remain vigilant of your safety and other people's safety.

  neither? having the exact same perspectives on *every* topic isn't really helpful when you're trying to broaden your horizons, but it's also not good if you disagree on every single topic imaginable.
  
  ideally, it's best to agree on some things and disagree on others (depending on the actual subject, obviously).

  the term ""insane asylum"" is extremely archaic and outdated, and its also damaging to people who struggle with mental illness who have been hospitalized.

  ","
  i'm always against going through people's phones, so i'm not sure if this is the correct way to go about this situation. if you know he is cheating on you for sure, then try explaining to him how you know (even though you don't have concrete evidence).
  
  i've never really been in this situation before, so i'm not quite sure how to approach the topic. it's a shame he didn't admit to it when you confronted him the first time, but maybe explaining to him that you love him, how you know he's going against you, and how hurt you feel might make him be more truthful.

  no, quite the opposite. the coronavirus is a global pandemic that has killed thousands of people, and you have to stop and consider how all of their friends and families are feeling in this moment. even those who haven't passed away who are struggling to recover are worried because this is something unlike anything we've seen before.

   your friend Jezebel said only people who are immunocompromised should stay at home otherwise it’s fine to go out, do you agree?

  i disagree. just because a person is healthy doesn't mean they're immune to the virus, and they can still carry the virus without showing symptoms and spread it to people who are more vulnerable, whether that's family or friends or even strangers. it's in everyone's best interest to continue self-isolating. it's fine to perhaps walk around the block, go to the park, etc etc., as long as you're not close around other people at all (more than 6 feet apart).

  if the region is under lockdown and people are not supposed to be out in large groups except for essential business, then i believe they should be reprimanded in some way, yeah. it's completely irresponsible to be out for no reason unless you're practicing isolation and walking around the block, etc etc.

  i'm not sure what other drastic measures we can take tbh, besides confining people to their homes and implementing some sort of law that repremands people if they're out of their house unless it's to do essential business.

  "
397317,"
   lol why did you tell your fam he cheated on you? family never gets over it even if you do

  they disliked him because he cheated on me once nearly 9 years ago, and they never let go of it. despite the fact that he's been my biggest support system since i revealed to him that i had mental health issues, as well as everything else that has been occurring in my life over the past 10 years.
  "
397322,"
   Do you think things fall apart because you didn’t want to get married or want children?
  ","
  no, that wasn't really a factor in us breaking up. needless to say, i *did* want to get married although i wasn't sure about the whole children thing or not. his feelings just dwindled because we were stuck at a standstill for quite some time, and as much as i tried to deny it, it was true.
  "
397323,"
   how did your families and friends react to the break up
  ","
  they were supportive of the decision, although my family decided it was the opportunity to bad-mouth him. :/ my family was never the biggest fan of him, and it honestly still angers me that they feel so strongly that they were happy that we broke up, which invalidated my feelings.
  
  my friends were better, on the other hand. they've been incredibly supportive.

  at the moment, i'm not sad. then again -- i'm also very tipsy, lol. it's also been around 6 months since we broke up, so i'm not as vulnerable to it now as i was initially. after we broke up, i was having meltdowns all the time and didn't think i could live the next day. but i focused on work, on my friends, and i also moved into a new house during that time, so i have a refreshed perspective on life.

  we broke up last august, and we simply had a conversation about our relationship and where we were headed. it was a long time coming, we were honestly just putting it off because neither of us had the heart to tell the other person how we truly felt. and it's been very difficult, but i've managed thus far.
  "
397330,"

  i'm single because we broke up, obviously. we were going steady for a long time, but things eventually fell apart and our relationship was at a standstill. we weren't where we needed to be, he didn't feel as strongly towards me anymore, and we decided to break up and remain friends.

  ","
  hello -- do you have a question?
  "
397373,"
   What’s a topic that your really interested in and why ?(:
  ","
  true crime and criminal psychology in general. i find it interesting what sets criminals apart from the regular population, their thought processes, and how their environment growing up contributes to their desire to hurt people.
  "
397374,"
   What are you most proud of?
  ","
  seeking treatment for my mental illnesses during a time when i was really struggling (actively s*icidal, didn't go to work for a week, couldn't eat or shower, etc etc). it totally changed my life around.

  ","
  i'm not entirely sure, tbh. on the one hand, it would be nice to live a life that isn't filled with strife, panic, or struggle. however, on the other hand, challenges and obstacles are what make us strong & wise, and we learn to grow and evolve from those struggles.
  "
397377,"
   Is it wrong to say where it came from?
  ","
  it isn't wrong to say that it originated in wuhan, china. what's wrong is referring to it as ""the chinese virus"" because it's detrimental against asian people who are already facing discrimination. like another anon pointed out, it's charged wording and scientifically incorrect.

   When was the first time you shaved your head? Why?
  ","
  i believe i've had my head shaved for two years now? i don't quite remember. i shaved half of my head on an impulse. i originally went to the hair salon for a trim and color, and then i told her, ""hey... shave half my head."" she went, ""are you sure?"" and i go, ""just do it.""
  "
397382,"
   Do you follow your heart or your head?
  ","
  a little bit of both. i follow my heart most of the time, but there's also a part of my mind that's screaming at me and telling me that what i'm feeling is irrational, lol.

   would you break up with your partner if you thought they were flirting with your cousin? but they said they weren’t but you insist yourself that they did it. when they asked how they flirted, you would just say “doesn’t matter. i know what i saw.” no explanation given.
  ","
  this situation doesn't really apply very much to me because i would never say ""doesn't matter, i know what i saw."" i would try to assess the situation based on what i saw and *also* gather input from my partner regarding their perspective on the situation. i would tell them that i was uncomfortable with how they were behaving, but i don't think i would go to such lengths as to break up with them.
  "
397385,"

  i wouldn't say i'm as far as proud of what i'm doing, but i'm content with how i'm spending my time and my reactions to certain things. i've been working from home, but i've also been remaining productive within the house such as keeping up with the cleaning, spending time reading, listening to new music, playing video games, and watching documentaries.

  "
397392,"
   What’s the best approach to resolving conflict?
  ","
  i think one of the best approaches to resolving conflict is to have an open discussion with the other person regarding what the conflict is about. it's important to be communicating and candid about what you believe, as well as receptive to what the other person is saying. you should try to come to a compromise that benefits the both of you.

   but he’s not wrong. the virus comes from china. why people are butthurt?
  ","
  there have been myriad illnesses that come from europe, but we don't refer to them as the ""italian illness"" or ""irish illness"" (as examples). the coronavirus originated from china, but it's a global pandemic now. nearly every country has infected people at this point.
  
  it's offensive to asian people in particular, because they're facing even more discrimination from it. even if they're not even chinese. calling it a ""chinese virus"" perpetuates that xenophobia.

397490,"
   Is it racist to call corona as Chinese virus?
  ","
  personally, i believe so. it only adds to the discrimination asian people face on a regular basis, and the fact that trump keeps on referring to it as the ""chinese virus"" instead of the coronavirus shows how close-minded he is and how disconnected he is from the severity of the situation.

  i've never used a quill before, but i have used a typewriter. i used to own two of them, but when i moved, i decided to donate them as i had no place to put them in my new house.
  
  i prefer typing over handwriting poetry and prose, because my mind often races too fast for me to keep up with it by hand. i'm a very fast typer, so it's easier for me to simply type -- especially when i think twice about something and decide to delete it. it's very convenient.

  it's healthy to give some attention to others, especially if you're giving other people a platform to raise their voice when they don't have much of a platform themselves, but if you're so invested in other people's business that it negatively harms you or others, then that's no good.

  i would assume directly from a store, unless you trust that person. if a friend is selling you an old iphone, then i think that would be fine because there's no worry about it being tampered with. but if it's from a total stranger, you don't really know what they could have done to the phone previously.

  i'm incredibly relieved at the moment. i walked into work this morning expecting the worst -- i thought the company was going to close down completely, tbh. we plummeted 30% in sales in one week, and 10 people from my department got laid off last friday.
  
  thankfully, management gave us all the okay to begin working remotely from home starting tomorrow for the next 30 days.

  i can cope with him dating. just because i have bad nights doesn't mean i'm not coping well (tbh, i'm coping a lot better than i thought i would have). we talk less often now than we did in the past, so there is some disconnection there, but i wouldn't be able to handle him not being in my life at all.

  i don't really feel comfortable elaborating significantly on it, but the relationship just sorta dissipated towards the end. he didn't feel strongly towards me anymore, and everything was stagnant for a long while. i gave off the impression that everything between us was fine, and although there was no conflict between us, there was a lack of intimacy that we used to have in previous years.
  
  i'm surviving, but i'd be lying if i said i was fine. i've had multiple meltdowns since the breakup, and i still have really bad nights. i have no interest in seeing anyone else, even on a casual basis, and i still very much feel strongly towards him. we're friends still, and we talk very often (maybe 5-6 days out of the week).

  my best friend and i met in middle school. we sat at the same lunch table, and everyone was talking about music. eventually, we came to realize that we were both interested in linkin park, and we talked endlessly about the band. we became best friends shortly thereafter.

   did u or ur friend get emotional over the positive affirmations? i got teary reading this tbh
  ","
  aw, lol. yeah, i've had serious talks with a coworker of mine who was going through some serious sh*t a while ago and she got emotional over what i told her, but it also made her feel better.
  "
397705,"
   What would be your dream job??
  ","
  stay-at-home writer, particularly a novelist (if i ever get the motivation to start working on writing a book, lol).
  "
397706,"
   Thoughts on this coronavirus? ?
  ","
  i believe testing *and treatment* should be more available than it currently is so more people are aware of where the virus is escalating and people can take more accurate precautions.
  "
397707,"
   Is it hard for you to usually come with a username?
  ","
  no, not usually. i've had a few different usernames on things over the years and they were all relatively easy to come up with.
  "
397708,"
   When are you going to buy things in bulk?
  ","
  i'm not going to buy things in bulk. there's no reason for me to do so, i have enough toilet paper already to last me a few weeks and the only thing my house may need in the near future is more paper towels (which my roommate can get through his job). we have enough food since we did grocery shopping recently, and we already have a lot of hand soap.
  
  buying things unnecessarily in bulk when you're otherwise healthy leaves less supplies for people who actually need them.
  "
397709,"
   Are you immunocompromised?
  ","
  no, i'm considered healthy and i'm also quite young, so i'm not susceptible to falling ill personally from the coronavirus.
  
  however, many of my friends and family members *are* immunocompromised, so if i were to contract the virus, i wouldn't be able to visit or be around them for their own safety.
  "
397710,"
   you’re not taking it seriously lmaooo.
  ","
  everything that i've stated about the coronavirus over the past few days indicates quite the opposite, but all right.
  "
397711,"
   what are some of your favorite positive affirmations?
  ","
  they're not sayings or anything, i just talk to my friends about whatever it is they're going through and i offer advice when they need it. otherwise, i just show my support of them, tell them why i value their friendship, and encourage them to continue being themselves and work toward their goals because they're beautiful people and deserve the world.
  "
397712,"
   what is your stance on marijuana?
  ","
  i support the legalization and taxation of marijuana. it isn't much different from people being able to purchase alcohol, except alcohol is much more unhealthy for you than marijuana is (and marijuana also helps with a lot of medical conditions too).
  "
397713,"
   do poems make you emotional? like, if someone wrote a poem that was specifically dedicated to you?
  ","
  yeah, pablo neruda is my favorite poet and i find poetry in itself to be quite moving. i've written a lot of poetry throughout my life.
  "
397714,"
   you're an amazing friend they probably love it when you do that to them
  ","
  i don't have the opportunity to do it often in terms of physical gifts and whatnot, so lately it's been things like sending encouraging messages and memes to my friends, as well as positive affirmations when they're feeling down.
  "
397715,"
   Is it rude and selfish to not take coronavirus seriously?
  ","
  yeah, i believe it's a bit selfish and also ignorant to not take it seriously at this point. it's considered a global pandemic, people are dying at alarming rates, and even if you're a healthy individual you could still carry the virus and pass it on to someone else who is more susceptible to falling severely ill from it.
  "
397716,"
   if i were your friend in person i would totally do this to you because you totally deserve it. i would literally do anything lmao
  ","
  aw, this is so sweet. thank you so much !!
  "
397717,"
   over the last month what moved u the most?
  ","
  listening to the les miserables soundtrack again this week, after not listening to it for over a year. i forgot how genuinely beautiful and heart-wrenching it is.
  "
397718,"
   is it weird i like to make people cry out of joy just to see them really happy? with so much stuff going on in the world i like being able to bring happiness to people.

  yes, i actually saw him on tuesday night.
  "
397720,"

  thanks for the follow ~~
  "
397721,"
   do you consider yourself selfless?
  ","
  sometimes, but other times i think i'm rather selfish. i'm trying to break out of that cycle of self-degradation, though. being called selfish has been instilled in me from a young age so i've been conditioned to think that about myself, and it's something i've been working on for years.
  "
397722,"
   Why? Is it because of sxx?
  ","
  no, s*x isn't terribly important to me. but i do need to see my partner on a regular basis, spend quality time with them, etc etc.
  "
397723,"
   Can you be in a long distance relationship? It means with someone in another country.
  ","
  long distance doesn't necessarily mean it only has to be with someone from another country, it could simply mean it's with someone with whom you don't see for months because of how far away they live from you.
  
  regardless, i wouldn't be in a long distance relationship. i need someone with whom i can speak face-to-face and see regularly.
  "
397724,"
   How many countries have you visited?
  ","
  besides the united states, i visited the bahamas last month.
  "
397725,"
   What would your book be about?
  ","
  i haven't written it yet, so i don't know. haha.
  "
397726,"
   Is your ex currently in a relationship?
  ","
  yes, he's been dating someone.
  "
397727,"
   What are your long term goals?
  ","
  eventually make enough money to live on my own, progress further in my career, progress further in my mental health recovery, write a book, travel more often, etc etc.
  "
397728,"
   Does instant connectivity and communication bring people together or push them apart?
  ","
  i believe it can do both. instant communication such as phone calls and texts and social media can bring people together on a large scale, especially from different countries, and there are more opportunities for education and growth.
  
  at the same time, however, i think it can make people distance themselves from close friends and family, especially if someone is sensitive and doesn't receive a text/call/response right away, they make think that they're not as close to their loved one as they previously thought (even when that's not the case at all).
  "
397729,"
   Would you prefer to lose all the memories you have now or never be able to make any new memories?
  ","
  i would much prefer to lose all of the memories i have now, especially considering a lot of them are terrible memories. there are great memories in between, but by not being able to make new memories, you won't be able to progress forward in life.
  "
397730,"
   What book has had the biggest effect on the modern world?
  ","
  probably such holy texts as the bible, quran, and torah (among others).
  "
397731,"
   Who’s the most selfless person you know?
  ","
  either my best friend or my roommate. both are extremely selfless people, to the point where they sometimes compromise their own happiness for the sake of other people's happiness. which isn't really the healthiest thing to do because i do believe boundaries need to be set in order to protect yourself while still caring for others, but regardless, they're very selfless.
  "
397732,"
   Shouldn't you plan for the future?
  ","
  i have long term goals, but i'm comfortable with where i am currently.
  "
397733,"
   Were you still in love with your ex when you gave up so much for him?
  ","
  well yeah, it occurred within the first two years of us dating. i'm still in love with my ex in the present day.
  "
397734,"
   What do you know about communications?
  ","
  probably not as much as i previously knew when i was actually taking courses in mass communications, media, journalism, business writing, etc etc.
  "
397735,"
   Do you have a job in communications?
  ","
  my current job is with a publishing company, where i'm a writer and editor.
  "
397736,"
   Why aren't you interested in dating?
  ","
  because ... i'm not? i have no desire to be with another person right now.
  "
397737,"
   yeah i have it why you look really pretty and cute ?

  unless you have an actual question, you can leave my inbox.

397738,"
   HI Cutie
  ","
  hello -- do you have a question?
  "
397739,"
   Do you only talk to people who think exactly like you?
  ","
  no, quite a few of my friends have differing opinions about things from me.
  "
397740,"
   Why isn't it ""productive"" to question Harvey Weinstein's conviction if he is already appealing against it?
  ","
  just because someone is thinking about appealing doesn't mean they're not guilty. he's just trying to receive a lesser sentence.
  "
397741,"
   Do you know Harvey Weinstein is appealing his conviction?
  ","
  there has been talk about his possibly appealing the conviction, yes.
  "
397742,"
   Accusations can be easily made up, can't they?
  ","
  i don't appreciate your victim-blaming here, so unless you have something productive to say, i'm just going to delete further inquiries from you.
  "
397743,"
   So you believe women more than men because you are female?
  ","
  i said victims/survivors, who can be someone of any gender. women aren't the only people who are ab*sed, and there's actually a lot of stigma against men who are ab*sed because they're not taken as seriously.
  "
397744,"
   What’s your type when it comes to dating?
  ","
  i don't have a type, and i'm not interested in dating.
  "
397745,"
   What makes you so sure Harvey Weinstein was properly convicted?
  ","
  a large majority of people do not fabricate accusations, especially when it comes to how many people came forward. accusing anyone of a crime could damage the accuser greatly, including their reputation if they're a public figure, and it brings up a lot of negative and traumatic emotions when discussing it publicly.
  
  there's no reason not to believe that weinstein is guilty. i believe victims/survivors above all else.
  "
397746,"
   Do you like pokemon?
  ","
  i used to like pokemon when i was much younger. i collected the cards and played the video games on my game boy.
  "
397747,"
   Were you following the Harvey Weinstein trial closely?
  ","
  not closely, no. i only know much about it based on certain articles i've read after the fact.
  "
397748,"
   How would you feel if you were falsely accused of a crime and convicted of it?
  ","
  i hope you're not suggesting that weinstein was falsely accused.
  "
397749,"
   What do you mean ""accusations aren't as fulfilling as convictions""?
  ","
  ""it brings a lot of closure to victims/survivors when their ab*sers are convicted of crimes.""
  "
397750,"
   what kind of beauty do you see in people? what do you think makes someone beautiful?
  ","
  i think seeing people's passions and love for what they do or who they're around is beautiful. when you see someone's eyes light up when they're talking about something they're passionate about, that's beautiful in my view.
  "
397751,"
   what kind of beauty do you see?
  ","
  beauty in music, beauty in the arts, beauty in the natural environment, beauty in community, etc etc.
  "
397752,"
   do you like that you're extremely emotional?
  ","
  eh, yes and no. my emotions make me an empathetic person and i can see the beauty in a lot of different things. however, my mood swings associated with my emotions can be hazardous.
  "
397753,"
   its ok to be emotional lmao
  ","
  i agree. i never said it was a bad thing.
  "
397754,"
   Do you think it is right that an accusation is as good as a conviction?
  ","
  accusations aren't as fulfilling as convictions, because you can accuse someone of a crime and have your voice ultimately unheard of the person is not convicted of that crime. it brings a lot of closure to victims/survivors when their ab*sers are convicted of crimes.
  "
397755,"
   Why do you think Harvey Weinstein should have received a much longer sentence?
  ","
  because he s*xually assaulted multiple people, and he could have received a life sentence had the jury found him guilty of predatory s*xual assault.
  "
397756,"
   Which books did you have to read for English Literature?
  ","
  i don't even remember at this point. i graduated seven years ago.
  "
397757,"
   How is your ex now?
  ","
  he's doing well for himself, and i'm happy for him.
  "
397758,"
   What course did you do at college?
  ","
  i started out as a creative writing major, but after i transferred schools, i changed my major to communications with a focus in english literature.
  "
397759,"
   Did you finish college in the end?
  ","
  i did, yeah. it took me another semester extra to complete my courses because a lot of my courses didn't transfer over, though.
  "
397760,"
   If you knew you would die of COVID19 today, what would you most regret not having done?
  ","
  i don't really have any regrets at this moment. i think it's useless to think back on regrets you may have, especially if there's nothing you can do to change them. it leads up unnecessary guilt and anger and sadness.
  "
397761,"
   What’s the dumbest thing you’ve ever cried about?
  ","
  probably crying to certain songs that aren't even meant to be sad songs, lmaoo. i'm an extremely emotional person and nearly anything can make me cry if it moves me enough.
  "
397762,"
   What was the biggest risk you ever took and did it pay off?
  ","
  i believe the biggest risk i've taken has been traveling back home from my first year away at college in order to be supportive of my ex and his family during a tragedy. i didn't really have a back-up plan in mind, i just knew it was something i needed to do at that time. i didn't enroll back in college until a few months later, and i also didn't even have a job or a car at the time.
  "
397763,"
   Do you believe love is blind?
  ","
  somewhat, yes. i believe that in certain circumstances, your love for a person can blind you to their toxicity if they exhibit toxic traits, and you may find yourself justifying their behavior even if it's harmful out of your pure love for that person. a lot of people don't even realize that it was harmful until after they've broken up or distanced themselves from their partner.
  "
397764,"
   What is your most cheerful memory as a grown up?
  ","
  any time i went on a vacation with my ex is a cheerful memory, particularly when it was just the two of us and we were able to disconnect from technology and social media for a few days and spend time enjoying each other's company.
  "
397765,"
   Are you known for being vengeful?
  ","
  i wouldn't call myself vengeful, but i've also never been in a situation where i've felt the need to seek revenge.
  "
397766,"
   Do you think the Italian government has overreacted to the Covid19?
  ","
  no, i believe that their decision to be under lockdown is completely justified. it's honestly the only way to contain such a widespread pandemic like this, and hospitals are already at maximum capacity.
  "
397767,"
   What do you think of the sentence Harvey Weinstein received?
  ","
  i'm glad he was sentenced to 23 years in prison, but i also feel like it should have been a much longer sentence.
  "
397768,"
   Serious question.. I know of a guy who's in his 60s now but when he was 20/21 he was dating a 17 year old and had a child with her. They got married and decades have past, but would it be wrong for me to still consider him a pxdxphile or is it not really a big deal to you?
  ","
  i'm iffy on this situation, because while he shouldn't have pursued someone so young when he was that age, it's hard to call someone a p*do when it happened over 40 years ago and was an isolated incident. even though she wasn't technically an adult yet, there are some places where the age of consent is 17, and at the time, it was probably younger than that.
  
  i wouldn't say it *isn't* a big deal, but i also don't know if it would be accurate to consider him a p*do at this time. it was extremely common for these types of things to occur in that day, and people were not as cognizant of predators as they are now.
  "
397769,"
   What do you think about the future? ?
  ","
  i try not to think about the future because it causes major anxiety within me. my old therapist previously taught me how to be mindful of the present moment, which i think is important in regulating your emotions and setting priorities in order.
  "
397770,"
   Can you make a sentence beginning with ""The great thing about the coronavirus scare is that it .... ""?
  ","
  i don't believe there's any silver lining to the coronavirus. people are passing away across the globe, italy is under complete lockdown, and i guarantee that flights coming in and out of the united states are going to be barred soon.
  "
397771,"
   What’s the most expensive thing you’ve broken?
  ","
  i don't believe i've ever completely broken an expensive item before. i cracked the screen of my ipad once a very long time ago, but it still worked afterwards.
  "
397772,"
   Fish? Yay or nay?
  ","
  i love fish as pets, and they're extremely interesting and complex to maintain depending on the sort of fish they are (and depending on whether they're salt water or fresh water fish). i've had a few fish in the past, and even with watching my ex's fish tanks, you can see their different personalities.
  "
397773,"
   What is the greatest evil in the world?
  ","
  greed, particularly when it comes to money.
  "
397774,"
   What musicians have changed their music a lot in the past decade?
  ","
  linkin park was the first band to come to mind because their music changed genres a lot throughout the course of their career. starting out as nu-metal, and then they progressed to an alternative rock feel, to sorta like a hybrid pop-rock feel.
  
  i love all of their music, but i do admit i stopped listening partially after minutes to midnight (which is one of my favorite albums). but since chester bennington passed away, i've been listening to them more and more often.
  "
397775,"
   If you couldn’t be convicted of any one type of crime, what criminal charge would you like to be immune to?

397776,"
   Why does nobody care about how the father feels when a miscarriage happens? It affects him too but everyone always and only cares about the mother.
  ","
  it's difficult to compare the feelings of a father to a mother when it comes to miscarriages. obviously it may affect the father's feelings too, but the reason why most of the focus is on the mother is because they're the ones carrying the fetus, and they probably already developed an intimate connection with them. it can also be a very traumatic experience for the mother.
  "
397777,"
   what is your opinion on this entire coronavirus crisis? do you think it’s as huge of a deal as the world is making it out to be? what do you think about so many commodities such as toilet paper being bought out so quickly?
  ","
  i believe that the coronavirus is a huge threat to everyone's safety, particularly those in vulnerable communities. just because you're healthy and young and will survive easily doesn't mean that you cannot carry the virus to those who *are* immunocompromised, and that's a huge issue.
  
  it makes sense for schools to be operating remotely, closing campuses, and for large office buildings to close and events to be canceled. we want to isolate the virus and reduce the number of those infected, especially considering hospitals can only hold so many people.
  
  i believe the hoarding of goods is extremely bad, though. people who are otherwise healthy are buying out supermarkets of all of their paper goods, hygiene products, etc etc., leaving those who actually need them to be in poor shape because they didn't get a chance to buy them.
  "
397778,"
   If you had to remove one color from the world forever, which would it be?
  ","
  yellow, perhaps? it's my least favorite color, but i would be hesitant to remove *any* color from the world because of all of the natural environments that boast those colors. yellow roses, for example, are my favorite type of roses.

  upper management apparently said that if finances are better by june, they can ""come back."" but honestly, they gave my coworkers zero warning with no respect for their personal lives. they told them today right before the end of the day, and they cannot come back. i'm talking to one of my coworkers about it all now, and she said ""it left a really bad taste in my mouth, and i probably won't come back knowing that the company has no regard for my personal feelings or life.""
  "
397788,"

  i don't know the full story, but from what i've gathered so far, we've plummeted in sales which has caused the company to make budget cuts, so they had to let people go because they couldn't afford to pay their salaries.

   What’s the last thing to bother you?
  ","
  seeing an email from upper management today, where they basically stated that if you're uncomfortable going to work due to the coronavirus then you can use your vacation time/PTO to cover the days.
  
  which i think is ridiculous, tbh. we're in an office building with hundreds of people, the risk of people getting the coronavirus is ridiculously high, especially considering the amount of cases on long island right now.
  "
397811,"
   What is the single most important thing in making a relationship work?

   I don’t know why but when people cheat whether it’s in TV shows, movies, real life, or etc. I suddenly get really pissed but I get even more pissed when that person takes the cheater back. What’re your thoughts on cheating/cheaters?
  ","
  obviously i believe cheating is terrible, because you're going against your partner's trust and loyalty to you in order to satisfy whatever urge you're feeling, whether it's sexual or emotional. if you're thinking about cheating on your partner, then that's a conversation you need to have with your partner themselves because it's an indication that the relationship isn't as great as it seems.
  
  when it comes to people taking them back even though they cheated, i think it can only be judged on a case by case basis, and it's also important to note that we're not really in any position to judge other people or their decisions. some people could be in ab*sive relationships and they're acting out of fear.
  "
397824,"

  i'm currently just enjoying being in the house alone, listening to calming music, smelling the scent of the candle burning, and browsing the internet.
  "
397834,"
   I was gonna say that maybe they need someone to provide their pleasures and also have someone to fall back on
  ","
  that sounds awfully selfish, tbh. if you're having trouble in the bedroom with your partner and/or you're not sexually compatible, then that doesn't justify cheating on your partner.
  "
397835,"
   How do you best deal with trolls on here?
  ","
  i just delete their messages or questions. there's no use in entertaining a troll, they feed into it and your commitment to responding to them, and it isn't worth the energy or time.
  "
397836,"
   What’s one question that you’re fed up of being asked on here ?

  not necessarily, no. having a mental illness and lashing out at undeserving people are two different things. the person lashing out is certainly inconsiderate and brash, but that doesn't mean they're mentally ill.
  "

   Do I sound shallow if I'm upset not because  this virus could be mortal to many people, but because I had plans to visit Italy at the end of the month on my birthday and shop in Milan? now I won't be able to do that and that to me is awful.
  ","
  i would say that's more privileged than shallow. you can always postpone your trip.
  "
397842,"
   Why do you think more guys are cheaters and flirty?

   A ton of schools are closing down
colleges are switching to all online courses
do you think that is stupid cause of the virus

  "
397846,"
   Do you agree that we shouldn't promote or encourage obesity and an unhealthy lifestyle? It seems to me that people misinterpret the ""love your body"" rhetoric and spread the idea that it's ok to be unhealthy overweight.
  ","
  obesity and being unhealthy aren't *directly* correlated to some degree, and i'm with the understanding that everyone's body chemistry is different so we cannot collectively take a stand without understanding the nuances of obesity.
  
  being overweight and obese is a concern because it does lead to further complications, especially musculoskeletal and heart problems. but just because a person is overweight doesn't necessarily mean that they're unhealthy -- they could have absolutely normal blood charts, have a good diet, etc etc.
  
  i understand the ""love your body"" rhetoric, but i also understand your perspective that it can also be harmful in particular circumstances as it may encourage people to engage in unhealthy behavior.
  "
397847,"
   Do you feel media is over hyping the virus
  ","
  yes, i touched upon this perhaps 20 minutes ago or so in a previous answer. the media likes to report the bad news, not necessarily the good news, so there's over-reporting on all of the severe illnesses and deaths associated with the coronavirus as opposed to the thousands of people who have recovered.
  
  on the one hand, i'm concerned since this is officially deemed a pandemic now, and it's almost impossible to contain it unless everyone is quarantined. people with compromised immune systems are susceptible especially, which is concerning in itself because a healthy person could carry the virus without knowing and pass it on to someone who cannot handle the virus.
  
  but overall, the mass panic and hysteria is ridiculous among consumers. buying cartfuls of toilet paper and hygiene products, etc etc. this is harmful because it's leaving less product for those who actually *do* need them.
  "
397848,"
   why are you dismayed about this?
  ","
  because i am not in a relationship, and the object of my affection does not return the feelings.

   Don't you think VIP is pointless? I thought the same when coins were introduced ~a year ago. It seems to me like ask fm is trying to make this site more alive bc the activity has considerably decreased since a few yearrs ago
  ","
  i agree that the reason askfm is implementing these sorts of changes is because they want to liven up the site. activity did decrease for a while, so they introduced incentives to keep people active.
  
  i don't really think it's pointless because it *is* making people ask more questions, but i do think it's ridiculous that they're offering the option to use real money to buy coins, lol.

  yes, i've experienced the same thing. it's just a part of growing older -- everyone lives their own independent lives and sometimes we grow apart from other people. it's natural and common.

   let's say you had a friend that had a real bad stutter, what would you do to try and motivate them to feel better in who they are?

  i would just treat them like any one of my other friends, and if they came to me with worries about their stutter, then i would try to explain to them that their stutter doesn't define who they are. and that if others are treating them differently for it then they're not worth having in their life.

  ","
  depends on the person because it can manifest in different ways. for me personally, they're usually physical symptoms like heart palpitations, feeling lightheaded, being shaky, not being able to catch my breath, etc etc. there's also a sense of fear involved (for me at least) but i can never pinpoint what the fear is -- it's like a sense of impending doom.
  "
397965,"
   Leigh, if someone drinks every day bc it helps them with their anxiety, are they at risk to become alcoholic?

  yes. they're using drinking as a coping mechanism to deal with their mental health, which isn't healthy. that's how a lot of people become dependent on alcohol (or any other sort of substance for that matter).

   how do you determine if a friendship is worth keeping?
  ","
  if the friendship is draining you of energy and you're putting more into the friendship than what you're receiving, then perhaps it's time to reevaluate the friendship. overall, your friendships should fulfill you and help you toward your goals, not hinder you in any way.

   How should I respond when I see people attacking all religion on the Internet?

  depends on the context of their argument. if they're denouncing every organized religion and are simply voicing their opinion, then i see nothing wrong with that. however, if they're targeting a specific religion and being discriminatory, and you feel the need to challenge their views, then i think it's appropriate to discuss why they perhaps feel that way.

  "
397980,"
   why feminist say it objectifies women? lol

  p*rn objectifies women because it gives off the impression that women are simply s*x objects and not a living, breathing human being. there's more of an emphasis on male satisfaction than female satisfaction.
  "
397981,"
   Do you think p*rn is a great way to learn about sxx?
  ","
  no, it's an absolute terrible way to learn about s*x. it doesn't teach you about consent or foreplay, and there's no communication involved. for proper s*x education, there are informative videos you can watch as well as being honest with your partner about your likes/dislikes.
  
  even s*x education in schools is lackluster.

  i believe it's different for everybody. some people are ready for marriage at a younger age, while others are comfortable waiting many years to find someone with whom they click on an intimate basis.
  
  i believe a person may be ready for marriage if they simply cannot fathom a life without the other person in it somewhat, if their communication is pristine, and if they're able to navigate through disagreements without hostility. there should be a sense of emotional intimacy there, and ideally your partner should not only be your lover, but also your best friend.

  i try my hardest not to, but it's inevitable for everyone to judge a person based solely on how they look or present themselves without getting to know them on a personal level. it's something i'm cognizant of -- we're humans and we're not perfect, and as much as we all know that it's wrong to judge someone at face value, we do it anyway.

  yes, there's a significant difference between being honest and being rude. it all depends on your intention and how you phrase things, how you come across to the other person and how cognizant you are of your tone of voice.
  
  being honest is always a good thing, within reason, but you should be careful with how you word your thoughts if the other person is sensitive or in a bad mindset. being rude, on the other hand, is when you have no regard for the other person's feelings to where your honesty is hurtful.

  having a mental illness doesn't excuse you from exhibiting poor, problematic, or toxic behavior. you cannot blame mental health on your inability to uphold friendships, relationships, etc etc., because you're acting in the wrong. of course, some mental illnesses *explain* the behavior -- but it does not excuse it. you still should be held accountable for your actions.

   What’s your opinion on wearing crop tops to school?
  ","
  i believe people can wear whatever they want to school, within reason, and crop tops aren't really that big of a deal in my opinion. school systems just have a tendency to chastise women and girls for wearing certain clothing items because they might be ""distracting,"" meanwhile they don't chastise other people in the same school systems for items of clothing they might wear, especially men and boys.

   At what point does striving for a better life turn from healthy to unhealthy?
  ","
  striving for a better life turns unhealthy when you're more focused on your goals than you are on our own self-care, when you don't know how to take time out for yourself because you're too worried about progressing forward in life. self-care is absolutely important, and as motivated you might be to better your own life, it's essential to make sure you're emotionally and physically healthy too.

   Is it more important to love or beloved?
  ","
  i believe they're equally as important -- to love means to show vulnerability and compassion towards others, whether in a platonic or romantic way, and it also keeps us humble. to be loved by others is also important because it's crucial to have a support system of others to have around when you're going through difficult times.

  responsibilities, on the other hand, are obligations we have on a daily basis to live our lives successfully. responsibilities are often seen as things like paying bills on time, going to work, making time out for ourselves, fixing things when they go wrong, etc etc.

  no, he can simply sign away his rights to the child. it all depends on the situation, though, as to whether or not i *personally* think it's appropriate. if a man doesn't want to be involved in his child's life at all but doesn't sign away his rights, and then falls behind on child support payments besides, then that shows that he's basically a sh*tty human being.

  obviously not every place will have that sort of technology, but i believe underage drinking is a serious matter because of how normalized alcohol is in today's society.

  i'm not exactly sure what your intentions are at this point, but if we're summing up this discussion, i should note that afterwards i discussed consent. there's little consent in terms of porn and prostitution, which is why i made a separate paragraph in my initial response discussing the difference between things like onlyfans & porn/prostitution.

  my prior answer was about consent in the sex industry. i've worked for below minimum wage as well, and i believe i do understand the parallel you're making. but just because the same can be said about every industry doesn't mean that the problems in the sex industry aren't significant too.
  "
398091,"
   as i said before, that can be said for EVERY profession. some ppl sell videos/photos for poverty reasons only and can’t get out of it too so.....? your “distinctions” are shaming tbh
  ","
  i apologize for giving off that impression, i'm definitely not shaming anyone because i have friends who are sex workers and i support their ventures.
  
  it's difficult for me to really describe the distinction because like you said, some people use sites like onlyfans to get out of poverty as well. but i think what it comes down to is consent. there's seldom consent involved in sex work like porn or prostitution, meanwhile when people sell pictures and videos, they're giving their own consent to release that content to subscribers (unless they're being extorted or something).
  
  hopefully this makes it clearer.
  "
398092,"
   the distinction you’re making is ridiculous tbh. there are ppl who are happy working as prostitutes. those who sell photos arent “better”
  ","
  i never said anything about one thing being better than the other. i just said there was a distinction between selling photos & videos online from working as a porn actor or a prostitute. a lot of people in the latter professions fell into it for one reason or another and feel as though there's no way out.

  i'm also of the understanding, however, that a lot of people in the porn industry and prostitution don't want to be in those industries, so it's a bit different from people who sell photos & videos online. it's still along the lines of sex work, but there's a clear distinction.

  a quality friend is a person who is there for you when you need them most, especially if you're going through a rough time. they'll check up on you occasionally and listen to you when you're upset while giving productive and supportive feedback.
  
  at the same time, a quality friend is also a person who will call you out if you're being hurtful or problematic because they have your best interests in mind.

   What about you is both a blessing and curse? In what situation is it a blessing? In what situation is it a curse?
  ","
  i guess my mental illnesses are both a blessing and a curse. it's a curse because i'm obviously mentally unstable, and i'm prone to episodes of depression and rage, which can lead to me hurting myself. my mood swings are rapid and unpredictable, which is exhausting.
  
  however, it's a blessing because it's helped me empathize with other people more who struggle with the same things and i've become an advocate for mental health awareness and reform.

   Don't you think it's profoundly disgusting how some people make fun of mentally ill people? I saw a video, some dudes were laughing and making fun of an old homeless man who was obviously mentally ill. It's just so cruel and inhumane.
  ","
  yes, i agree with you, especially in terms of the homeless. a lot of homeless people are mentally ill or even veterans who may have PTSD or other mental disorders, but society views them as inferior to those who are more privileged or better off (like having homes, jobs, etc etc).
  
  i do think it's disgusting and shameful, and there needs to be more awareness and advocacy on behalf of groups who are more susceptible to mental health problems.

   What is the difference between being wise and being cunning?
  ","
  being wise is having insight in problems and learning to deal with them accordingly. you may reflect upon past issues and use those lessons learned to approach new problems with a different perspective.
  
  to be cunning, on the other hand, means to achieve results through manipulative, toxic, or deceitful ways.

  i don't think that's controlling, no. that's just you trying to set two friends up together because you think they would be compatible.
  
  it *would* be controlling if you insisted upon them getting to know each other if they were resistant to the idea, or if one or both of them weren't looking for a relationship.

  no, i don't think i would be able to handle a long distance relationship. i need to see the person i'm dating, spend quality time with them in person, etc etc.
  
  long distance relationships work for some people, but certainly not all. i require physical intimacy (no, not just sex) for me to feel loved and comfortable.

398125,"
   Would you include in the definition of wisdom the ability to predict the future and to get things done?

  it depends on the relationship. sometimes they're not growing at the same rate as the other person, or perhaps their priorities don't align anymore. in some cases, it's just a matter of distance and growing apart because interests have changed, or there's a disruption in the chemistry, whether it's emotional or physical.

  this isn't true -- there are plenty of drugstore makeup products that are high quality and are healthy for you, while there are also higher end makeup products which are lower quality and not necessarily as healthy for you. you're essentially just paying for a brand name that's recognizable.
  
  additionally, self respect has nothing to do with the amount of money someone does or does not have. you cannot assume someone has no money or is broke simply because they use drugstore makeup.

  you can't put a time frame on moving on from someone you once dated. everyone has a different method of moving on, and everyone gets over people at different rates. i don't know how long it will take me to move forward, if i even do at all, so i'm just taking each day at a time.

398187,"
   if he dumped his new girlfriend and wanted to date you again would you accept him?

  in a heartbeat, but under certain conditions. he would have to be sure about his feelings towards me and be willing to do this for the long run. i'm sure he's still confused about his feelings at the moment but hasn't spoken to me about them directly, probably because he doesn't want me to get my hopes up and not move on.
  "
398188,"
   Your relationship with your bf hasn’t changed. Him being your bf or best friend is basically the same lmao
  ","
  they're not the same thing, no. there was no sense of intimacy towards the end, and we acted more like friends than anything else because he wasn't in love with me anymore, and honestly he almost felt obligated to be with me because he was afraid of what i would do if he broke up with me. but he couldn't ignore or deny his feelings because he simply wasn't the happiest that he could be with me, and he does deserve to find someone who will make him happy.
  
  we're not in a relationship anymore, but we're still friends. just because we're not in a relationship anymore doesn't mean that things haven't changed. everything has changed.
  "
398189,"

  ","
  i'm not angry at him, no. like i said -- he didn't do anything wrong, he was open about his feelings, and we tried everything we could to fix the situation but he couldn't just ignore how he was feeling.
  
  i still love him, and i probably will for a long time. i'm sad more than anything else that things didn't work out, but we're still friends and i'm grateful that he's still in my life because i don't know what i would do without his friendship.

   why did she piss you off? i mean she’s not entirely wrong you deserve to be with someone who loves you?

  that is indeed true, but she made it seem like he did something wrong when he didn't actually do anything wrong. people fall out of love -- it's common. she didn't really talk about or ask about how i was feeling about it, and that's why she apologized afterwards.

   Fantastic girl ?
  ","
  as my bio indicates, i'm non-binary.
  "
398213,"
   What makes you stronger every single day? What makes you get up that morning?
  ","
  work is my main motivation to get up in the morning. i don't *love* my job, but it's definitely the best job i've ever had thus far. and i like going into work and feeling very productive most days. also, coffee is a strong motivation of mine.
  
  i wouldn't consider myself to really be strong, especially lately. i'm just going through the motions and seeing what happens on a daily basis. i'm taking each day at a time.
  "
398214,"
   Have you ever had fried frog legs before? Would you ever try this?
  ","
  i never have before, and i'm not sure if i would be willing to try it.
  "
398215,"
   If you have the chance to go 10,000 feet up in the air in a building would you do it? Have you ever done this before? Tell me about your experience if so.
  ","
  pretty sure buildings literally cannot be built that tall. the empire state building, for example, is only 1,250 feet tall or so. i've been to the top of the empire state building and it was exhilarating, however.

   What’s your personality type ?
  ","
  like, the meyer-briggs personality types?
  
  INFJ.
  "
398217,"
   Do you have a phobia? What is it?
  ","
  anyone want to ask me questions? i have some stuff in my inbox, but i don't feel like answering them. :/
  
  any topic is fine, i just don't answer questions of a s*xual nature and i delete hate, trolling, etc etc.
  "
398218,"
   What dumb accomplishment are you most proud of? ?
  ","
  moving out of my parents' house into my own place, especially when i was in such a bad mindset at the time. it's probably the best thing i could have done for myself.
  
  i think it's a dumb accomplishment, mainly because people move out of their parents' house all the time and it isn't really anything *too* special. but it's been so important for my mental health.
  "
398219,"
   Would you rather be part of something or part of someone?
  ","
  perhaps i'm misunderstanding the question a bit, but i think being a part of someone may be a bit unhealthy. you should ideally be your own person outside of your relationship, not that you're a part of someone else's identity.
  "
398220,"
   I want to try it with my siblings, but still don't have the materials for it. Please, enjoy your time once you try it ⛺
  ","
  i have zero materials too, haha. i would just need to buy a tent and a sleeping bag or an inflatable mattress, or something. the rest of my friends have pretty much everything else.
  
  i wouldn't buy anything until a date is set in stone, i don't even know if a camping trip will happen but it's something we've been talking about.
  "
398221,"
   Camping ? that's nice. I have never tried it before. Have you ever tried it? how was your experience?
  ","
  i've never been camping before, no. i've always wanted to try it, however !! it seems like a lot of fun.
  "
398222,"
   Does he feel the same? Are you his support system?
  ","
  yes, he feels the same. he doesn't want me out of his life either and he considers me his closest friend.

398223,"
   what about dating?
  ","
  i'm not interested in dating.
  "
398224,"
   What’s on your bucket list this year?
  ","
  -- get another promotion at work.
  
  -- get back into photography.

   I'm sorry to hear about the breakup, Leigh, but wish you all the very best going forwards. If you ever need someone to chat to, give me a yell xx
  ","
  thank you so much, friend. i truly appreciate it.
  "
398226,"
   What’s one thing you wish you knew how to do?
  ","
  i wish i knew how to sing well. music is one of my passions, and i think i would have pursued music as a career if i could sing.
  "
398227,"
   Do you take vitamin supplements/collagen/protein powder etc? If so did you notice a difference in your health.
  ","
  i used to take a multi-vitamin, but i haven't taken them in a while (even though i probably should get back to it). i didn't really notice a difference in my health.
  "
398228,"
   Okay, why don't we follow each other?
  ","
  you can follow me if you'd like. but i have no intentions of following you considering most of your answers are in a language i cannot understand.
  "
398229,"
   Coronavirus?
  ","
  i'm not worried about the coronavirus, haha. at least for myself personally -- it may become an epidemic in the united states soon enough but i'm healthy and there's a low risk of me contracting it.
  "
398230,"
   Did you break up with your bf? I am so sorry Leigh!
  ","
  yeah, we broke up a few months ago.
  
  it's all right -- obviously i'm not doing great, but i have both good and bad days and i find it's been best for me to distract myself with work and my hobbies and being with my friends.
  "
398231,"
   Are you more happy in 2020 than the previous year?
  ","
  no, 2020 has been miserable so far. granted, the end of 2019 was also relatively bad considering the breakup, but 2020 has been terrible because i've been sick for half of the past two months and my ex's dog was put down. :/
  
  the cruise was a nice distraction and vacation from everyday life, but it was difficult to come back to reality when i returned home, haha.
  "
398232,"
   What's your idea of a perfect weekend? ??
  ","
  waking up early and having a cup of coffee at my desk while i play video games or browse social media. doing some easy household chores to make myself feel productive. perhaps going out to brunch or day-drinking with a close friend (but not to the point of oblivion, lol). taking a walk through the park with my camera and taking in all of the nature and elements. playing video games at the end of the night and going to bed at a reasonable hour so that i can get a full night's rest.
  "
398233,"
   Where do you see yourself five years from now?
  ","
  i can't envision myself five months from now, let alone five years from now. everything is so up in the air and unexpected.
  "
398234,"
   Name 3 things you never thought you would do but end up try
  ","
  i never thought i would have the opportunity to go on a cruise before. i never thought i would be renting a house with my friends. and i also never thought that i would actually find a job in my field where my writing has been distributed both online and in print.
  "
398235,"
   What habits are holding you back from success?
  ","
  my self-doubt holds me back from being more successful than i actually am, at the moment. i'm constantly questioning myself, and lately i've been allowing other people to somewhat take the reins instead of making independent decisions myself.

  "
398237,"
   What ability do you possess  that you’d think others would find amazing?
  ","
  my ability to express complex thoughts and emotions into the written word.
  "
398238,"
   What do u think ur purpose in life is?
  ","
  i honestly don't know anymore. i've been trying not to think so deeply into things like that because i feel as if my life is almost meaningless most days.
  "
398239,"
   Favorite band you've got to see live?
  ","
  linkin park, hands down. i've seen them quite a few times in concert prior to chester bennington's passing, and they were the best concerts of my life.
  "
398240,"
   Can you keep a secret?
  ","
  yes, one of my better qualities is my loyalty and ability to keep secrets of my friends.
  "
398241,"
   Are you a better person than a year ago?
  ","
  i would like to believe so, yes. this time last year, i didn't have as much responsibility or leverage at my job, and i've gained two promotions since that time. personally speaking, i don't really remember what i was like one year ago, so i can't really say much to that.
  "
398242,"
   How’s your Saturday going?
  ","
  it's all right. i only woke up 45 minutes ago, though. i just made a pot of coffee and i've been sitting down and doing some freelance work for my job this morning.
  "
398243,"
   Which sound do you find most pleasant, the violin or the piano?
  ","
  the piano is one of my favorite instruments, especially since it's so versatile. i would choose the piano -- however, i also love the sounds of a violin, they're equally as beautiful.
  "
398244,"
   Do you like acrylic nails?
  ","
  they're aesthetically pleasing to look at, but i don't wear acrylic nails. i keep mine bare most of the time.
  "
398245,"
   Where would you like to live?
  ","
  i've always considered the carolinas or virginia as an option, or perhaps massachusetts, new hampshire, or vermont.
  "
398246,"
   May you ask me anything? Please ?
  ","
  i seldom ask people questions, and when i do, they're only to whom i follow.
  "
398247,"
   What’s your number one rule in life?
  ","
  life is too short to deny yourself simple pleasures. it's okay to treat yourself and do things that make you happy within moderation. we don't know when our lives will end, so we should ideally live every day with our best interests in mind.
  "
398248,"
   How much do you spend on groceries and how often do you shop?
  ","
  my roommate and i go grocery shopping every two weeks, and it usually comes out to around $150-200 depending on what we need.
  "
398249,"
   what’s the difference?
  ","
  when you love the idea of someone, you're not in love with the actual person and you realize you're unhappy when you're actually around them or they continue to disappoint you.
  
  being actually in love with someone means loving them wholeheartedly, including their flaws, and being enamored with the time you do spend together, whether it's physical presence or just talking to them.
  "
398250,"
   What are your desires?
  ","
  right now, the pizza i'm about to eat, an ice cold beer, and my bed.

398251,"
   Did you make a buddy meter?
  ","
  i don't know what that is.
  "
398252,"
   Are you sure you’re in love with your ex or you just love the idea of him/familiarity?
  ","
  no, i'm in love with him. i know what it feels like to love the idea of someone and this is completely different.
  "
398253,"
   Why?
  ","
  from my understanding, the people who are getting sick & dying from coronavirus have compromised immune systems, are young, or are elderly.
  "
398254,"
   Are you scared of it?
  ","
  no, there's a low risk of me contracting it.
  "
398255,"
   Do you ever ask yourself questions
  ","
  no, if there's something independent i want to say i just use the random question generator.
  "
398256,"
   River cruises might be more your thing then, different city every day and usually around the 7 days mark. A friend of my mom's has been on a few, she loved being able to get off every day and do a little exploring
  ","
  i've never even heard of those before !! that sounds perfect. and probably much cheaper than a caribbean cruise, lmaoo.
  "
398257,"
   Favorite form of talking? Text, call, FaceTime, in person, etc.
  ","
  texting and in-person.
  "
398258,"
   Do you think you'll be going on any more cruises?
  ","
  i'm not sure -- if i do, i don't think i'll do another 8-day cruise like the one i just did. it seemed almost *too* long, especially since 4 out of the 8 days we were just cruising the ocean and couldn't leave the ship.
  "
398259,"
   Post a selfie?

  my sick tan lines when i was on the cruise, haha.

398261,"
   Have you tried the new Cherry Coke vanilla? It is coke with cherry and vanilla in it mixed together.

398262,"
   My gf just gave me all the details  of  her having sex with  her ex bf and  im fn miserable now. Its partially my fault since i asked  but im so destroyed by this, how can i go back to normal please ? PLEASE
  ","
  i'm sorry you're going through this. you're going to ultimately have to decide what you want to do with the relationship -- either forgive her, or end the relationship completely. being cheated on isn't something that should be taken lightly and it's normal for you to feel distraught.
  "
398263,"

398265,"
   is that why he didn’t move out with you? i just read about your breakup. hope you’re doing well
  ","
  i'm sure it was one of the main reasons, yeah.
  
  i'm not really doing so well -- i have good days and bad days, and most of my bad days happen in the evening when i have nothing to occupy my time. during working hours, i'm relatively okay since my mind is busy.
  "
398266,"
   Did you ever get into Mario games have a child? Or any of the merchandise?
  ","
  i used to love the mario games when i was younger, yes. i don't have any merchandise from the games, but it was essentially a staple of my childhood because i developed an interest in video games at an early age.
  "
398267,"
   Favorite foods ???
  ","
  sushi, veggie burrito bowls, hummus, cheeseburgers, halal food, chicken parm, jerk chicken, picadillo, etc etc.
  "
398268,"
   How do you feel about the way your government is dealing with the Coronavirus?
  ","
  i think a better way to phrase this would be *not dealing* with the coronavirus, haha.
  
  apparently the government doesn't think it's a threat, despite the CDC saying otherwise. which i think is foolish, because it's only a matter of time before there's also an epidemic in other countries.
  "
398269,"
   Have you ever been bowling?
  ","
  yeah, many times. i'm not the biggest fan of bowling, though.

  not very often, thankfully. it's always in my pocket.

398272,"
   Do u sleep with ur tv on or off?

   Are you looking forward to the weekend? Got plans?
  ","
  i'm looking forward to staying home and sleeping in, lmaoo. i don't have plans except grocery shopping.

398274,"
   does taking a time off help with a relationship or make it worse?
  ","
  it depends on the relationship. sometimes it helps, sometimes it hurts.
  "
398275,"
   Do you think you’re mature?
  ","
  i believe i'm mature enough for my age, yes.
  "
398276,"
   I’m sorry if this is rude to ask but what do you do when you miss your ex? Do you reach out to him? How do you cope with a breakup?
  ","
  sometimes i'll reach out and just say hi, i won't tell him i miss him or anything because i don't want to put him in a weird position.
  
  other times i'll just distract myself with television, books, and video games.
  "
398277,"
   Do you have new goals for this year?
  ","
  i want another promotion at work and perhaps go camping and more photography excursions, but other than that, no.

398278,"
   Who was the first person did gig tell about the break up?
  ","
  my close friend.
  "
398279,"
   What did he say when you did? Did he give excuses about him being busy?
  ","
  no, he would just say he didn't feel like talking and needed time alone. it would be the same if we were together at times too, we would just sit in silence sometimes but it wasn't that comfortable silence that we used to experience in happier times.
  "
398280,"
   When you felt he was distant did you talk about it with him or let it side?
  ","
  both. i didn't know if i was being too clingy, so sometimes i let it go, haha. i didn't want to appear smothering or overbearing.
  "
398281,"
   Why did you hide your breakup from anons? Your anons are always nice lmao
  ","
  you only see the anons i post. the hate messages get deleted.
  "
398282,"
   I admire your honesty. Are you as open as you are here in real life?
  ","
  depends on who i'm around, but generally yes. i only have a close circle of friends and i'm always honest and open with them regarding my feelings and life circumstances. it hurts me more than anything to keep things hidden away within me.
  "
398283,"
   Did he breakup with you before 2020? Keep your chin up, things will get better.
  ","
  yeah, we broke up in september.
  "
398284,"
   Does his family know about the breakup?
  ","
  yes, they're aware of it as well as the fact that he's currently dating someone.
  "
398285,"
   Have you ever felt bitterness towards him since the break up?
  ","
  somewhat, but not really. like i said, i still love him. that feeling overpowers everything else despite everything.
  "
398286,"
   Aren't all couples stagnant after decades? Like that madly in love phase kinda fades as you settle into your roles and get comfortable. Especially if you have a family and perhaps don't have too much time for each other.
  ","
  there's a difference between being comfortable and being stagnant. when i say stagnant, i mean that there wasn't much excitement anymore, we didn't go anywhere together anymore, etc etc. even two years back, we were going on vacations and to the park and out to dinner and then it slowly dwindled and stopped, and all we really did was hang out and watch youtube together.
  "
398287,"
   did you try to save it?
  ","
  of course, we both did. but you cannot control your feelings, and i can't make him love me when his feelings were not there anymore. we had to learn to accept it.
  "
398288,"
   Was the break up at least easier to process since you kind of saw it coming? Like you felt the relationship being stagnant but were still holding on to hope? But deep down you know it's best for the time being
  ","
  no, my mental health prevented it from appearing easy at all. it's been months and i still break down crying every now and again, perhaps 3-4 times per week and especially when i'm listening to music.
  
  i just keep thinking about ""what could i have done better?"" or ""what went wrong?"" even though he's reassured me a thousand times that i did nothing wrong and he still values me greatly as a close friend.
  "
398289,"
   You two were moving forward. You moved into a new house. I thought your relationship got stronger. Did you fight a lot?
  ","
  no, we didn't fight at all actually. there wasn't any conflict between us, we just kinda existed together, if that makes sense. even though i've been progressing in my own personal and professional life, as well as he in his professional life, that doesn't necessarily mean the relationship got stronger.
  "
398290,"
   I can't fathom being in love with someone yet hanging out with them and their significant other. My BPD could NEVER lmao
  ","
  they've been in settings where i was drinking heavily, so ... lmaoo.
  "
398291,"
   Are you still in love with him?
  ","
  yes, i'm still very much in love.
  "
398292,"
   oh so you don’t like him too as much as you used to? can you pinpoint what made you fall apart?
  ","
  i'm still in love with him, so no. but i understood that he needed distance and i didn't want to force him to hang out when i knew he needed alone time. like i stated yesterday, the relationship just grew stagnant and it felt like we weren't growing together anymore.
  "
398293,"
   Wait.. I remember one time a few months back you refused to share what was going on but you were feeling svicidal and depressed. Was it the break up?
  ","
  probably, lmaoo. i've been very unstable ever since the breakup despite taking my medication every day.
  "
398294,"
   Are you jealous or happy that he’s dating?
  ","
  i'm happy that he seems happy in his current position, and i'm not jealous of him or her at all. i still care about his happiness, and yes -- i do wish it was still me. but there's no use in feeling jealous because it's a toxic emotion and it will only hurt me.
  "
398295,"
   How long did he start dating her after y'all broke up?
  ","
  about two months or so, i believe? so it's evident that they were talking, but he didn't cheat on me and i think his feelings developing for her was a catalyst that made him realize he wasn't in love with me anymore.
  "
398296,"
   do you hang out with his gf?
  ","
  i've hung out with her a few times, yes. she's honestly a hilarious person, and i can relate to her a lot. we struggle with a lot of the same things.
  "
398297,"
   did you notice a change in his behavior?
  ","
  we both grew a bit distant from each other and started seeing each other less, and i think that was his way of processing his feelings to know whether or not him falling out of me was actually happening or not.
  
  his actual behavior didn't change, but our chemistry did.
  "
398298,"
   Is she one of his friends? isn’t it awkward that you live with his friend?
  ","
  they've known each other for about a year. and no, it isn't awkward at all -- like i said, my ex and i are still friends and there's no animosity between us at all. we all hang out together on occasion.
  "
398299,"
   how did he open up to you about it? How did you take it when he broke up with you?
  ","
  it was a long time coming, and we finally had an opportunity to sit down and have the time to talk sincerely and deeply about our relationship with no interruptions. it just came up in conversation because we both felt the difference, and it needed to be addressed.
  
  obviously i was very upset, but things like this (massive life changes, etc etc.) don't really hit me until days or weeks after the fact, so i was numb to it for a long time.
  "
398300,"
   Dang is she prettier and younger than you?
  ","
  lmfao, to be fair i think everyone is more attractive than me. but yeah, she's pretty and she's our age.
  "
398301,"
   Are you going on dates?
  ","
  no, i have no desire to start dating.
  "
398302,"
   What have changed then in your relationship if you talk daily?
  ","
  the fact that we're not dating anymore? lol.
  
  feelings change -- it happens, and people fall out of love or grow out of them after a while. it's an unfortunate part of life, and as unexpected as it was, i can't do anything but accept it for what it is.
  "
398303,"
   That must be hard. What would you do if he started dating someone else?
  ","
  he already has. like i said, this happened months ago and i've just been not talking about it on social media at all. it isn't a break up that happened recently.
  "
398304,"
   What’s on your mind today?
  ","
  work was on my mind most of the day for obvious reasons, but now that i'm home, i'm planning on playing stardew valley for a few hours.
  "
398305,"
   Have you ever had a muffin before? If so what flavour? ??
  ","
  i eat muffins occasionally, and blueberry is my favorite.
  "
398306,"
   Have you had to tell a co-worker you didn't want to hang out with them outside of work because you already had  a full quota of friends?
  ","
  no, i haven't done that. that seems pretty rude, tbh.
  "
398307,"
   Do you think a man with a beard is more attractive or a man without a beard?
  ","
  depends on the man, haha. some men are more attractive with and some are more attractive without, and levels of attraction vary because everyone has a different taste.
  "
398308,"
   If you could start over would you have dated your most recent ex?
  ","
  yes, i don't regret anything about the relationship at all. he's helped me in so many different ways.

  ","
  yeah, we're still friends. we don't see each other very often, but we text nearly every day.
  "
398310,"
   You're doing way better than I would've, Leigh. I probably would've attempted suxcxde, and I'm ashamed to say that. Life sucks, this place is hell if I've ever seen it. Ik you aren't religious but I will pray that you (and others) to find total peace and satisfaction one day.
  ","
  i'm not going to lie -- i've come pretty close, and my coping mechanisms haven't exactly been the healthiest, which i'm also ashamed to say. it's just natural for me to hide it, and i do it extremely well ... almost too well.
  
  thank you, i appreciate it.
  "
398311,"
   Do you think you and your bf will ever get back together ?
  ","
  i honestly don't know. there's still a large part of me holding out hope, but i know that isn't healthy and i should try to focus on myself instead of a relationship that has already ended.
  
  i'm taking each day at a time, focusing my feelings on my friends and career, and spending time delving into my hobbies to make the time pass. at the bottom of my heart, i want things to be different and us to get back together, but that isn't reality right now.
  "
398312,"
   why did you break up?

  he fell out of love with me -- we were stagnant, our relationship wasn't really going anywhere. and as much as he tells me it isn't my fault and i did everything i could, he says that he doesn't think he can love me to the same extent that i love him.
  
  i'm not really sure how he feels, despite him saying that. but i do believe it is best for us to spend some time apart, if anything to figure out our feelings because we *were* stagnant for so long. i was just terrified of things ending because of mental illness things, i didn't want to lose him and that's why i kept holding on so desperately.

  i did, i went with him and his family. we made these plans last spring, way prior to the breakup. everything was already paid for, and we're still on good terms, so i figured it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if i turned down the trip last minute.

  ","
  i'm going to be brutally honest here -- i'm currently in this situation, and it is terrifying. it's heart-wrenching. i've been at the lowest of the lows and it takes so much for me to drag myself out of bed in the morning, knowing what i had is now lost. and i don't know if i can ever get it back.
  
  my boyfriend and i broke up, a few months ago. i've been hiding the breakup on askfm because i didn't want to deal with the backlash from anons and the snotty comments, but comments like these and learning of my friends from askfm breaking up with their partners makes me feel more confident to finally say this out loud, outside of my small circle of IRL friends.

  people who are addicts are often thrown in prison for possession, etc etc., and they're not given proper help for their addiction, which only increases the rate of recidivism in the community. addiction is a health care concern, and money should be allocated towards rehabilitative purposes to better treat drug addicts so that they can recover.

  take the time to educate yourself on their diagnoses and ask questions. the best way to fully understand your partner's mental health is to become totally invested in their symptoms and behavior, what triggers them and what comforts them, etc etc. there are so many resources online and books to gain a higher understanding of the mechanisms behind most mental illnesses, and it's best to remain as educated as possible.
  
  also, always try to be there for them and validate their concerns when needed and as much as you can. an important part of mental health recovery is having a strong support system, and you should be able to provide them with unconditional support (within reason, i.e. unless they're exhibiting problematic behaviors).

  the power of unconditional love and friendship. the value of communication and trust in all sorts of relationships, both romantic and platonic. the healing powers of music and art. the sense of spirituality and freedom you feel from being immersed in nature.

398415,"
   You have two friends who have asked you to choose between them, you agree. Now how do you choose between the two? What traits make you prefer or value one over the other?
  ","
  to preface this, i personally wouldn't agree to make a choice between two friends and would likely either remain civil with *both* of them, or cut them both off completely. i think it's incredibly manipulative for a person to force you to choose between them or someone else.
  
  however, for the sake of answering the question, i think i would weigh the pros and cons of each person's personality and who i connect with better, have better times together, and in general who serves me better in my own pursuit of happiness. i would look to see if either of them have any problematic viewpoints or behaviors that would lead to betrayal or sadness in the long run, and then go from there. in all honesty, you shouldn't be friends with a person whose presence doesn't fulfill you.

   What books on your shelf are begging to be read?
  ","
  ""you"" and ""hidden bodies"" by caroline kepnes.
  
  i started reading ""you"" on the cruise and got about halfway through it, and it's really intense. it's actually a bit different and better than the television show (the one on netflix). you get real insight into each character because the descriptions take their time instead of being rushed, and even though i know what happens at the end of the story, i'm still enjoying it.

  the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring.

  i'm not entirely sure, actually. it would ideally be pleasant to have no more hardship in life -- but at the same time, hardship and obstacles are what make us stronger and more versatile, wiser even. we learn from our hardships and mistakes even though they may hurt us or other people, and it makes us more well-rounded.

  ","
  without a doubt, yes. i would absolutely be willing to relocate to a distant location with my loved one, even if it meant not seeing my friends or family often at all. i'm not close with my family by any means, anyway, and i know i can always make new friends.
  "
398426,"
   Do the people in your life bring the best out of you?
  ","
  for the most part, yes. i have a few friendships that i've been questionable about lately because they do not bring out the best in me, and we're sorta bad influences on each other -- especially in terms of drinking and making bad decisions, haha. they're a great friend and i'm also very attached to them, which makes the situation harder for me to process.

   Tesco is now the first supermarket here to produce plasters/bandaids for many skin tones. What's your opinion? Is it better/worse than only supplying translucent ones? Is it a step in the right direction to make poc feel more included or are the translucent ones best for all? Is it anti/racist?
  ","
  tbh, i'm a white person and i feel like this question would be better answered by someone who's a person of color. as a white person (and a very pale white person, at that), i've always used either the beige bandaids or translucent band aids and never thought twice about the color.

   The show Friends is now going to have a reunion episode. What's your opinion this? Are you excited, apathetic, dreading it, anticipating it etc? Are you fearful that they might ruin the original with a new episode? Do you think it'll be better than Joey's spin-off?
  ","
  i liked the show ""friends"" when i was much younger, but after re-watching it within the past year or so, i didn't really find it to be spectacular or funny really. it was majorly hyped up during its time, which makes sense because it kinda pushed the boundaries in that time period (i think it debuted in the 1990s?).
  
  i'm apathetic towards the reunion episode, i have no intentions of watching it because i simply don't care. i don't really think it will ruin the original series because i've heard that it isn't going to be a ""real"" episode, just a sit-down with the actors/actresses as they reflect upon the series.
  "
398432,"
   who do you admire most?
  ","
  the person i admire the most has faced so much adversity in their life, but they've still managed to come out stronger in the end and utilized their experiences as a stepping stone toward the success they're garnered today. they've also been humbled by their past experiences and obstacles, and it has equipped them with better knowledge and understanding of how the world works.
  "
398433,"
   Do you think soxial media is making people less kind, more callous?
  ","
  in a general sense, no. i don't believe so. social media simply allows people the opportunity to exhibit their rude/callous behaviors, particularly when it comes to anonymous question-asking sites like askfm or curiouscat. people like to hide behind anonymous identities and show their true colors because they're too ashamed to show that side of them in public.

  ","
  depends on the situation and context. some hate is better off ignored, while other forms of hate should be addressed.
  
  personally speaking, when it comes to online hate (like on askfm), i just ignore it most of the time. it isn't worth getting riled up over a stranger's opinion on your life, and it also isn't worth giving that person the privilege of seeing you get upset over their comments.

  no, there's no use in being afraid to voice your own opinion. by making your opinions known, you'll garner a more authentic group of friends/relationships, because then you're not basing your inner circle on something you don't necessarily believe in.

  it's a difficult situation to be in -- not every situation like that is going to be the same. in some cases, it may help if you do tell your ex that you still have feelings for them, but only if you think there's a chance things could be different going forward.
  
  if your ex is clearly happy with their life and/or in a new relationship, then it's better for both of you if you simply tried to move on. you deserve to be happy as well, and hindering yourself by remaining in love with an ex who doesn't reciprocate those feelings only hurts you.

  ","
  people can absolutely befriend and remain friends with those of other sexes and genders, and it isn't inevitable that feelings would develop between them. platonic relationships are extremely common between people of different sexes and genders, and i personally have several friends who aren't of the same sex or gender as me.
  "
398477,"
   Are you ok with your significant other still being friends with their ex?
  ","
  it would depend on the context of their relationship and current friendship. if my partner's ex still had feelings for them, then i'm not sure that i would be comfortable with the idea of them being friends still because it isn't giving the ex a chance to move on (or it might give them hope that my partner would break up with me in favor of them).
  
  in most other circumstances, though, i see nothing wrong with exes being friends with each other.
  "

  ","
  personally, i don't think having a friends-only option would benefit me because most of the questions i receive are anonymous, and i prefer the public platform. i often have anonymous people come to me for advice and whatnot, and they prefer their identity to be unknown for privacy's sake.

  ","
  the fourth edition of my job's magazine was completed for online production last week, which is the collaborative efforts of myself alongside a graphic designer and a print production manager. nearly everything in the magazine was written, proofread, and cross-examined by me, and i accompanied the magazine with an editor's letter, which introduced readers to what they're about to read.
  
  my supervisor read my letter and said it was ""superb,"" which made me feel really good about myself. :'))

   Where do you find inspiration? :3
  ","
  when it comes to creative writing, i seem to derive inspiration from the events that are currently going on in my life, whether it's heartache or a sense of accomplishment or negative thoughts stemming from poor mental health. i've always seemed to write more eloquently when i'm not in a healthy frame of mind, for whatever reason, but it's very cathartic to let those emotions out in a constructive manner.

   Which is a greater proof of love in your opinion: changing for the one you love or accepting the person the way he/she is?

  neither, to a certain degree. when you truly love someone in a healthy manner, you push them and motivate them to remain consistent with their natural selves but to also improve upon their natural selves. you're not changing them, but you're seeking to watch them gain the confidence to be the best version of themselves they can possibly be.

   Does feminism have a bad name and if so why?
  ","
  based on its presence on social media, and especially the older presence feminism had on askfm, it has been given a bad reputation. legitimate feminists are not taken as seriously because younger, more ignorant people who consider themselves feminists have sorta ""taken over"" the movement, and there are so many subsections of feminism that a lot of people simply don't understand.

   If a friendship is making you feel stressed/ unhappy due to them sending you messages relentlessly on more than one social media everyday, is it best to not say anything to avoid hurting their feelings despite it causing a lot of anxiety, or to say something, and risk ending the friendship? 1/2
  ","
  (cont) ... (cont)... I have tried to say this several times in a gentler way, but it doesn’t seem to make any difference. It’s making me want to delete both social media platforms. What would you do? Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks!
  
  --
  
  that's a really difficult situation, and it seems like your friend is overly dependent on you for one reason or another. if you've tried to say something in the past in a gentle way and they didn't get the hint, then i think it's appropriate to approach the subject again in a more straightforward way so that they know how stressed their behavior is making you.
  
  friendships shouldn't make you stressed out or unhappy, and your friend definitely needs to know that they're being over-bearing and perhaps even a little obsessive. you have your own life, and they have theirs, and they need to understand that you're being pushed away from them because of their obsessive need to talk to you. if they truly respected you, they would respect your boundaries.
  "

  no. even when i took classes in religion when i was a child, i've never believed or been religious.

398692,"
   Why did you leave the feminist movement?
  ","
  i still hold the same opinions, but i stopped associating with the feminist movement in general (at least the new feminist movement of the 2010s) because most feminists focused on insignificant issues, spread misinformation, cherry-picked arguments to support their own causes, and were just in general giving the whole feminist ideology a bad name.
  "
398693,"
   Why don't you know if you want a new therapist?
  ","
  it would mean starting over from scratch, and i have such history with my old therapist (we saw each other for three years) that it seems like so much effort to start from the very beginning and guide the new therapist through the ins and outs of my life starting from my early teenage years until now.
  "
398694,"

398697,"
   What is the purpose of religion?
  ","
  some people turn to religion because it was simply an environment in which they were raised, and they were taught by their families and community to believe in that religion because it answers questions, i.e. do we have a higher purpose, why are we here, etc etc.
  "

I told him he should be courageous and just get it over with but he said he'll tell them when he's ready (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... I decided to let them know anyway just so he wouldn't have to live with the tortured secret for so long and could move on. I sent them screenshots of the texts for proof and whatnot. He found out and was extremely angry with me, cussed me out, said very hurtful things, and cut me off. Why do you think he was being so sensitive and overreacting to it? It really bothered me when all I was trying to do was help. I feel like he was being really ungrateful and I'm better off without him. Your thoughts?
  
  --
  
  if this is real (and i really hope it isn't), then you're honestly a terrible friend. i can't tell if this is actually someone trolling or not because it's simply common sense to not out your friends to their friends and family -- it's extremely dangerous.
  
  not only did you disrespect your friend, but you but them in harm's way by outing them to their friends and family. if their family was extremely homophobic, it could be possible that they could have kicked him out, disowned them, and severed ties with them. it isn't your decision to make, and you should be ashamed of yourself for taking this into your own hands.
  
  he was not being sensitive or over-reacting at all. i'm glad that he cut you off because you need to learn how not to cross boundaries, and he's better off without you in his life.
  "
398701,"
   Is Feminism your religion?

  "
398703,"

  breaking up with them is entirely your decision -- i don't know the dynamics of the relationship, and it isn't something for me to decide like, ""yeah, you should end the relationship."" it isn't in my place to make that judgment.
  
  do what you think is best, but i always believe communication is key. ask them why they feel that way, think of ways to make it better, etc etc. try to fix the relationship before ending it completely, not unless there's absolutely no hope left.

   Where is the line between protective and possessive in a relationship?
  ","
  protective is being concerned for your partner and wanting to shield them from harm's way, but also recognizing that they need to make their own decisions. you should also trust them that they'll make the correct decisions too, out of respect.
  
  a possessive relationship is borderline ab*sive and causes you to become too obsessed with your partner and prevent them from living their life according to their own terms.
  "
398721,"
   How would you deal with that? It’s also not right to blame them and if you say something like “well, you’re responsible for yourself and you have the power to change that” they would probably get mad.
  ","
  they'll probably get angry, but it's the truth and they'll have to learn to accept that. obviously you should phrase it in a nicer way, but it is true that ultimately they're in control of themselves and if they believe that they're lazy, it's in their own power to change. they cannot deflect their own insecurities onto you and blame you for something that isn't your fault.

  well, if they're literally saying that you're causing them to be lazy, then that's definitely wrong in itself. we are responsible for ourselves and ourselves only, and ultimately they need to make that choice to change themselves. they cannot rely on you or hold you responsible for something that's entirely their decision.

  however, my boyfriend keeps telling me that it's perfectly fine. i saw his dog the night before he passed away and he took his last pain med from me when he refused it from everyone else. he went outside to use the bathroom with me leading him when he wouldn't go out for anyone else. my boyfriend said i did more for him then than if i were to have shown up at the vet clinic.

  after a few weeks of treatment, even though it took quite a few trials of medication experimentation, i definitely began to feel the effects of both medication combined with weekly therapy appointments. i felt lighter -- like i had something more to live for, i had a purpose and that was to help other people who have been in similar situations and show them that living life is possible afterall.

  ","
  my day has been going fine thus far. i was late to work this morning because of traffic, which wasn't too great, but the day was overall very productive.
  
  i got home from work about an hour ago, and i quickly did some dishes and took a long, hot shower. i'm just relaxing on my laptop & listening to music for now.

398819,"
   Do you think it's easier to warm yourself when you it's cold or to cool yourself when it's hot?
  ","
  for me personally, it's much easier to warm myself up when i'm cold. you can layer on as many layers as you need. however, when it's too hot outside, there are only so many layers you can take off.
  "
398820,"
   Have you ever eaten something that fell on the floor?

  they're equally as challenging. you cannot compare mental illness to physical illness because they both come with their own battles.

   What motivates you when you wake up, to do the things REQUIRED in life?

  coffee motivates me to get out of bed in the morning -- most mornings, at least. sometimes there is no motivation whatsoever, but thankfully i haven't had a relapse in depression in a few months.
  "
398824,"
   why? it's bad for ur health

   She literally cut off the friendship just bc of that. And it’s been 2 days now, she still hasn’t replied. Should I text her again and try to clarify things?
  ","
  i don't really know the dynamic of your relationship, so saying it's been two days doesn't really mean much. for some people, two days is a lot, while for others, it's such a small increment of time.
  
  do what you think is best. if texting her after only two days is what you think is best, then try that. personally, i believe things are better discussed in person though.

   I had a couple close friends for years that I hung out w frequently. Then about early last year, I noticed they would invite a mutual friend out to places and never bother asking me if I wanted to come. They barely reached out to me anymore so I kinda cut them off. Was I being too sensitive?
  ","
  nah, i don't believe you're being too sensitive. i would have reacted in the same manner. if someone isn't putting out the same effort as you are, and they're not even considering you when making plans anymore, then that's something that either needs to be addressed or cut off completely.
  
  i've never had an issue with cutting people off, though. but that's just me, lol.
  "
398867,"
   Can certain songs trigger you bc they remind you of a ""dark"" time in your life or does it sound ridiculous and puerile?

  neither. music doesn't trigger me because music has always been a comfort in my life, and if anything, the music i listened to during my darkest days have become comfort songs to me in my adult life.
  
  i also don't think it's ridiculous for people to be triggered by songs, though. music conjures strong memories and it's very normal and common for others to be triggered by music.

Now she hasn’t replied to ur last text. Would u text her again and make her understand or just let it be?
  ","
  personally, i would allow some time for your friend to cool off and go back into a steady mindset before bringing the topic up again. people need space, and sometimes that space allows for greater thoughts into the subject. at that point, i believe it's appropriate for you to reach out (whether by text, or even better, in person) after that waiting period to explain what you meant and that you didn't intend to upset them. you acknowledge that you upset them and you apologize for it coming to that point, but it was a misunderstanding and you want to correct the wrongs.

  i think it depends on what you're buying, whether or not you're getting sale items or store brand items, etc etc. there are also discounted stores like aldi or lidl that offer healthy products for a cheaper price.
  
  i do think it says something about america that unhealthy/fast food costs so much less than buying a salad (for example).

   I think privacy is important and should be respected rigorously. For example I wouldn't invade someone's privacy (i.e reading their private correspondence) even if I had the opportunity and I'm like a very veery curious person overall. I wouldn't feel ok with myself doing it.
  ","
  i agree wholeheartedly. i was raised in an environment where there wasn't much privacy at all (i didn't even have a bedroom door, for gods' sake). when i wrote in journals, my parents would find the journals and read them. it's the main reason why i resorted to the internet -- it was a way for me to document and discuss my feelings, particularly with others, without my parents finding out because the internet history had disappeared by the time they had checked the computer when i had gone to bed.

  i didn't get much feedback from anyone when i worked in retail, but my boyfriend has a letter from a customer hanging on his fridge at his house. it was about two paragraphs long, explaining how thorough and helpful of a manager he is and how he has made her experience at the store worthwhile and fulfilling. it was ridiculously sweet.

398873,"

   he's not allowed to eat sugar?

   When a friend of yours is really excited about something and they keep telling you about it with such an enthusiasm, is it rude to tell them you don't care or you feel indifferent towards it?

  being paid less than other workers, and just the general atmosphere of the work environment might be more hostile for people of color, especially if it's a field dominated by white people. people of color have struggled to fit into certain workplace environments simply do to their race and feel the need to work harder just because they're not given the same respect.

  when you perform an activity for someone out of fear, it's because you're focusing on the possible repercussions of your actions. you're more focused on doing things correctly to that other person's standards.
  
  when you perform an activity for someone out of respect, you're focusing on how to better the activity for everyone involved, whether it's just you, you and your boss, or you and an entire team. there's a sense of comradery that exists because everyone is working towards the same goal.

  ","
  i think it's alarming, but mostly for the people in china who have been struggling with the virus most of all. in other countries, however, the common flu is one of the deadliest it's been in ages, and i think that's largely due to its mutation over the years, as well as the lack of care people put in to not washing their hands, not vaccinating themselves and their children, etc etc.
  
  the coronavirus has also led to a lot of racism -- there are so many people who are being racist towards chinese people for absolutely no reason, and it's disgusting.

  for one, i think it's unhealthy and very unfair. standing for extremely long periods of time can cause detrimental damage to your body (especially considering people whose jobs consist of standing are usually in those positions for 8+ hours).
  
  second, i think it's ableist. there are people with medical conditions who cannot stand for that long amount of time, who also cannot afford to go see a doctor to obtain a doctor's note. health care alone in this country is a privilege, not a right, and so many people go untreated for a variety of maladies because they simply cannot afford it.

   so there's a guy I've been talking to for several months as friends via text message and on the phone who lives in another country. during our last phone convo, I mentioned I was bored and was considering learning new languages. Hebrew being one (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... He seemed disgusted that I wanted to learn it and mentioned he hated Jews bc of the conflicts between them and Arabs in the middle east (he lives there). There's nothing I can do to change his mind or at least have him make a distinction between Jews and zionists. Something else he said that made me uncomfortable is he talked about coming to see me in the future and buying me gifts and going out on dates... I told him we're just friends, nothing else and he said he knows but still wants to do it in the future. I found that odd, am I wrong for that? Because of those reasons, I'm considering telling him I'd like to cease communication and wishing him luck. 1) I don't want him to unrealistic expectations abt our relationship 2) I dislike his mentality. Would you personally cut him off? Tysm for reading this.
  
  --
  
  i wouldn't tolerate antisemitism in any form, so that's an immediate turn-off for me. obviously he's set in his ways and to have such a strong dislike for a group of people who are usually genuinely good is wrong in itself. jewish people are already marginalized so much in society, even in the united states.
  
  as for the whole going out on dates thing, it *does* seem a bit pushy and it sounds a bit like he doesn't want to respect your boundaries and just remain friends. he seems to expect more out of the relationship than what you have in mind, and that may cause conflict in the future.
  
  i don't think it's out of line for you to want to cease communication with him. the bigotry, for one, being the biggest thing of all, and then him acting like he wants to be in a relationship with you even though you clearly said no is another big indicator. personally speaking, i would feel uncomfortable and trust my own instincts.

   I feel we've all had one of those moments where a song is stuck in your head you can't get out. But do you ever get just a random word stuck in your head on repeat? I know that sounds odd, but I'm wondering if I'm alone in that. ?
  ","
  you're definitely not alone in this at all !! i constantly have random words, phrases, or just mash-ups of different sounds get stuck in my head all the time, to the point where the words themselves become distorted and i over-analyze their sounds. it begins to disintegrate and not sound like a ""real"" word anymore.
  "
399109,"
   Follow up question!! Do you currently have any music stuck in your head that won't go away? And is it a song you enjoy, if so?
  ","
  at the moment, no (surprisingly). i think it's because i'm hearing my roommate's video game from the other room, though, so that's currently occupying my head.

   Are you introvert?
  ","
  i'm somewhat of an extroverted introvert, if that makes any sense. i'm introverted in the way that being around a lot of people completely drains me, and i require time alone in order to recharge. however, i can act extroverted when i'm with a very small group of friends and i thoroughly enjoy spending time with my close friends.
  "
399111,"

  ","
  i'm afraid of being abandoned by those closest to me. i have an irrational fear that all of my friends secretly hate me and only talk to me because they feel bad, for whatever reason that would be. i'm terrified that everyone is going to get fed up with me and leave.

  ","
  yes, i'm very much a perfectionist. i have to double-check everything i do to make sure it's done correctly, and i always put in 110% in everything i do, especially when it comes to work. i've always relied on myself instead of other people in terms of projects because i simply cannot trust other people to do the same level of quality work that i do.

  i'm currently watching ""pandemic,"" which is a new documentary on netflix about epidemics across the world, like avian flu and swine flu and whatnot. it's incredibly interesting.

   Hey everyone, I just wanted to say my recent question was related to whether or not race, culture and heritage are biological or a social construct. If you've anything else to say about it, plz do so here. I'm aware that it's a controversial topic, which is why I wanted to hear your opinions on it.?
  ","
  from my understanding, race and heritage are biological while culture is more of a social construct. many races have their own unique cultures, but if you're of a particular race and have been *around* a different culture instead of being a direct member of that culture, i don't think it's right to identify as that race or culture. you can simply say you're close with that culture and understand it, not that it's *your* culture.
  "
399146,"
   Hypothetical: You do a DNA test like 23AndMe and your DNA shows that you've a significant percentage of DNA from a race you didn't know you were part. Do you then get culturally educated? Start identifying as the race and reclaim their slurs? What actions do you think are/aren't appropriate?
  ","
  i actually took a DNA test last year and it showed that i was a significant amount of ashkenazi jewish, as well as ukrainian, german, austrian, italian, etc etc.
  
  even though i knew i had jewish in me as a heritage, the percentage was around 20-25% which was a lot more than expected. however, i was raised catholic and no one ever spoke about the jewish traditions in my earlier family ancestry. i'm comfortable stating that i have jewish ancestry, but i wouldn't feel comfortable reclaiming slurs or anything of the sort because i wasn't raised with that cultural significance.

399155,"
   Is forgiveness important to you, or do you think that it is better to hold grudges? ?
  ","
  it's extremely toxic to hold grudges, and holding a grudge ultimately hurts you more than it hurts anyone else. even if you cannot forgive someone, holding a grudge against that person is unhealthy. certain things you just have to accept and allow them to be.
  "
399156,"
   What was the wisest advice you were ever given?
  ","
  if a friendship or relationship does not ultimately serve you or make you a better version of yourself, then it isn't worth having around in your life. you may have fun with certain people, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're healthy for you to be around, and if the relationship is unevenly-balanced, then it's time to readjust your priorities and make a decision.

   if we try to forget the past and just look forward can we ever truly heal that which hurts us? or will follow like a repellent shadow?

  the issue with this is that you cannot forget the past -- you have to learn how to accept the past for what it is, and then you can truly move forward. if you simply try to forget or suppress the past, then yeah, it's going to affect you in the long run.

   What's your opinion on horse racing? Have you been to a horse race or watch it on tv? Do you think it's cruel to whip a horse, use it for entertainment? Is it unfair that so much money is used on horses when there's so many poor people?

  ","
  the deaths of chris cornell and chester bennington shocked and upset me the most, mainly because i felt so connected to them and their music.
  
  people who claim that mourning about a celebrity death is unnecessary obviously don't understand that you can wholeheartedly be influenced by and understand the significance of that celebrity. you don't have to know them on a personal level in order to mourn their loss, and mourning isn't just reserved for the person who passed away either. you can mourn for their friends and families.

  my supervisor told me today that i must take care of myself and my own health before committing myself to my work, otherwise the work will reflect my state of mind and won't be at its best. i have to be in a healthy mindset, and missing one half-day of work isn't going to affect anything in the long run.

   Is there any part of your life that you would, ""do over again"" if given the opportunity? Why or why not?
  ","
  i'm not sure i would take up that opportunity. although terrible things have happened in my life that i've overcome, everything occurs within the domino effect, meaning that if one thing is changed, then everything subsequent to that situation will also change. if i do over one thing in my life, then i would be a completely different person than who i am today.

   How could your own life personally be improved by increased education regarding the topic of mental health?
  ","
  as you know, i've always been an advocate for mental health awareness and decreasing the stigma around mental illness based on discussion of various topics both online and in person. my own personal life has also been improved, because it has showed me that there's a greater sum of people who struggle with mental health (regardless of its severity) than meets the eye, and not only does it open the eyes of other people struggling, but it also helps me understand my own struggles with my own mental health journey.
  "
399216,"
   From your perspective, how do you view the more heavily stigmatized mental health issues? Some examples would be Borderline Personality Disorder, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and many others with a sort of (seeming) social isolation/stigma surrounding them.
  ","
  there's a higher rate of s*icide affiliated with the more highly-stigmatized disorders, including the ones you listed above. any more severe sort of mood disorders, nearly all personality disorders, psychotic disorders, and dissociative disorders have a high rate of misunderstanding and stigma surrounding them.
  
  it also doesn't help that they're stigmatized by mental health professionals themselves. some psychiatrists/psychologists are hesitant to diagnose someone with certain disorders because they're judgmental towards it themselves, especially with respect to BPD. people with BPD are often seen as manipulative, attention-seeking, and ab*sive, which couldn't be further from the truth.
  "
399217,"
   I love that idea!!! Do you keep the journal online or is it a physical journal?

  it's a physical journal. it's called ""mindful journaling"" by tara ward.
  "
399218,"
   I know both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy are both currently popular forms of interactive behavioral health. Have you ever tried (guided or not) work books specializing in either of these styles? Do they help?
  ","
  i've been interested in buying the dialectical behavioral therapy handbook, which is geared towards people struggling with borderline personality disorder. other than that, i haven't tried any self-guided or otherwise guided workbooks.
  
  my former therapist combined CBT and DBT in her sessions, with focuses on past trauma as well as current mindfulness, and occasionally she suggested in meditation and we implemented deep breathing exercises in our sessions if i was feeling particularly anxious that day.
  "
399219,"
   Considering that I've never read them, I'm looking for opinions. Have you ever read some form of self help book? If you have, do you find them genuinely helpful, or are they as condescending as the genre of book seems to be?
  ","
  i've never read any self-help books, but i do have a mindfulness journal that i occasionally write in that allows you to live in the current moment and urges you to describe the things going on in that present time so that you gain a sense of grounded-ness. it's really interesting and it helps me on occasion.
  
  it's mostly writing -- they give you prompts, such as ""describe where you're situated right now. what do you hear? what do you smell? how do you feel?"" and things of that nature.

   I should use this as an open warning for all of today's questions! I've mental health on the brain this morning. Sorry!

Considering your day to day life, do you recognize any of your routine to be harmful or beneficial in terms of mental health?
  ","
  my normal routine is beneficial to my mental health because it provides me with a sense of stability -- getting up and going to work everyday, doing household chores when i get home, making or ordering dinner, cleaning, and then settling down to relax at the end of the day.
  "
399221,"
   Trigger warning again, sorry!! Please feel free to not answer if my questions are upsetting. 

Are you involved in any online support groups? If yes and if you're open to sharing, do you find them helpful? And are you active (posting and commenting), or do you mostly lurk/browse?
  ","
  i'm not a member of any online support groups. however, when i was a teenager, i found that my time spent on active forums unrelated to mental health actually helped distract me from my life and provided me with a place to vent and a sense of comfort, knowing that there were other people on there who felt the same way. i've grown close to a lot of those people, even though we've never met IRL.
  "
399222,"
   I haven't sent questions in a good minute! Sorry! Trigger warning for this one!

What comes to mind when you hear (or read) the word ""narcissistic""?
  ","
  i think of narcissists, who are generally people who only think about themselves and how situations can affect themselves solely. people who put down others if it means enhancing their own lives. people who won't admit that they're wrong even when presented with evidence proving the contrary. people who are all-around selfish too confident in themselves to the point where it becomes detrimental to those around them.

  i work better on my own. i don't like group projects or doing anything that involves someone else sharing the same responsibilities as me. it mainly only happened during high school and college, but group projects really annoyed because no one else would do their part well enough and i ended up taking the reins for the sake of my own grade.

   QOTD⚡: What was the last risk you took? Did it end up working out for you or not?
  ","
  the last risk i took was deciding to get drunk on friendsmas last wednesday, knowing that i had to wake up at 7:00am for work the following morning. lmaoo.
  
  nevertheless, it worked out well. i had a great time and even showed up to work early, even though i had a terrible hangover. the day was hell but i got through it.

   What is the most amount of pain you've been in
  ","
  physically, getting my ribcage tattooed.
  
  emotionally, witnessing the reaction of someone close to me when their parent died and they felt they had nothing left to live for.
  "
399307,"
   This is kind of a personal question and I don’t really know who to ask about it but.. I had a therapist who helped me through my really rough summer, but I feel like she still sees me as my lowest self. As if I haven’t grown since then. Is it wrong to discontinue seeing her for this reason?
  ","
  if you've tried talking to her about this and she can't see your progress, then perhaps you're better off discontinuing your sessions with her. ideally, a therapist is supposed to analyze and compare your emotions and behavior in the now to how it used to be, and if she isn't focused on you right now, then there's no way to progress forward.
  
  i would talk to her about this if you haven't done so already, and if she isn't receptive, then yeah i would find a new therapist.
  "
399308,"
   Oh that makes sense! I’ve heard that areas that are more bony hurt more and other areas that are more just skin hurt less. It’s honestly so hard not to get another now that I have one, I get what people say about it being addicting, now ?
  ","
  also the fatty areas tend to hurt more, for whatever reason, especially areas that aren't exposed as often like the calves or inner thighs.
  
  i.e., my half sleeve was tolerable except for the areas that were leading into the inside of the upper arm, like near the armpit. omg, that killed me, lmaoo.
  
  but yes, they're totally addictive. it's been like... two years since my last one, i think? ugh, i need more but the ideas i have are super big and expensive.

  where on your body is it? it depends really on the area of the body, as well as your own pain tolerance. some places hurt more for people than others.

  i don't think you're understanding the fact that i've said that i stopped questioning ""why"" a very, very long time ago.
  
  it isn't productive to question why it happened. what happened has happened, and questioning why has only made me more hateful, angry, and self-destructive. they're not positive emotions, and there's nothing i can do about it now. the only thing i can do is move forward.

  it wasn't really a good school, but we had the capabilities to take out a loan for me to briefly attend the school i had wanted to go to at the time. after some events went down during my second semester, however, i returned home and attended a local college for the remaining 3.5 years.
  "
399330,"
   Are you naturally intelligent or just well educated?
  ","
  i suppose a combination of both? i've been privileged to have had a good education growing up and the loans to attend college to obtain a degree, but a lot of my studies were independently done. even when i was home from school, i did a lot of reading and researching online about random things.

  i had a few friends, but i felt disconnected from them for the most part. i dated my best friend when we were in middle school, but after we broke up, i felt like i had no one for quite a while until we made amends and became friends again. everything else felt meaningless and superficial.

399336,"

  who knows, to be honest. like i said earlier, i stopped questioning ""why"" a very long time ago.

  abandonment by my loved ones.
  "
399338,"

  i've never discussed it with him because he's also been an inflicter of ab*se in the past, and i really have no desire to talk about it to any of my family members at all.

399340,"
   Are you able to talk with your parents about the abuse they inflict on you or are they simply in denial because they are suffering themselves?
  ","
  they would never confess to it -- there's too much arrogance, pride, narcissism there. they would continue to gaslight me and claim that i made everything up for one reason or another, and it isn't a conversation worth having at this point. my parents are the type of people who don't believe they've ever done anything wrong, even when presented with evidence, and they don't know where all of my mental health issues came from because apparently i had a ""perfectly normal"" upbringing.
  "
399341,"
   And does your brother cop the same kind of abuse that you do from your parents?
  ","
  i'm not entirely sure, because he's significantly older than me and wasn't really around when most of the ab*se happened.
  "
399342,"
   I don't ask you these questions to be mean to you Leigh. I just like to help you to think and view your situation from different angles.  You seem quite normal to me on this medium of communication and there are lots more people worse off than you
  ","
  i never thought you were being mean, just a bit naive to be perfectly honest. i hope i don't give off the impression that i somehow think i've had a much worse life than other people, because obviously there are a plethora of people who are in worse positions than i've been in. however, i'm also not going to discredit what i've been through because my voice deserves to be heard too.
  "
399343,"
   Do you have siblings?
  ","
  yes, i have one brother.
  "
399344,"
   Did your parents judge you a lot when you lived with them?
  ","
  my parents judged me a lot, and honestly they still do even though i don't live with them anymore. the lack of control they have over me now has only caused them to try to control me more even though i'm out of their reach, and now i have the freedom to ignore it instead of being caged inside with it 24/7.
  "
399345,"
   Do you prefer to live on your own?  If so why?
  ","
  yes. i've been thriving ever since i started living on my own, especially considering my past history with living at my parents' house. i finally feel free and able to do as i please without judgment, anger, or fear.
  "
399346,"
   What is it about your own personality and traits that you don't understand?
  ","
  it's constantly changing -- it's a symptom of BPD, having general crises and disturbances in identity understanding. most people who live with BPD don't have a defined understanding of who they are because their personalities themselves are disordered.
  "
399347,"
   What stopped you from living independently before 3 years ago and did you need others to help  you live?
  ","
  i've only been able to move out in the final quarter of 2019 because of a pay increase, thus enabling me to make enough money to pay towards rent.
  
  i wasn't able to afford that prior to my pay raise when i was promoted months ago, and i definitely was not able to afford that going back three years ago, lol.
  "
399348,"
   Do you know others who know themselves?
  ","
  at this stage in my life, yeah. we're all in our late 20s leading up to mid-40s, so in general my friends have a significant understanding of their own personalities and traits.
  "
399349,"
   And are you bettering yourself and your life?
  ","
  yeah, i've been working hard at bettering myself and my life ever since i first pursued mental health treatment a little over three years ago. my life has significantly improved since that time, especially now that i'm living independently and living my life according to my own terms.
  "
399350,"
   What other modes of making sense of the world do you use apart from the accepted scientific method?
  ","
  there isn't really much else i rely upon besides scientific, unbiased evidence. i have no spiritual or religious beliefs, and my understanding of the world and society is based upon the studies i've done personally and read in my own free time.
  "
399351,"
   Is there a reason and cause as  to why you were dealt the cards you have?
  ","
  to my knowledge, no. they're simply things that have happened to me, and i stopped questioning ""why"" a very long time ago because it leads you nowhere. the only thing you can do when you've been dealt a bad set of cards is learn how to deal with them appropriately, adapt to changes, and work towards bettering yourself and your life.
  "
399352,"
   One person doesn't believe in human induced climate change and another person does.  So who is right?
  ","
  the correct answer is that humans have negatively contributed to climate change. that's scientific and not up for debate.
  "
399353,"
   Are you saying that the cards we're dealt are random and without cause or meaning?
  ","
  sometimes, yeah. there are certain instances where people's mistakes catch up to them and they have to pay the penalties, but life is mostly a game of chance and unfairness.
  "
399354,"
   So if a person doesn't believe in something, that means it doesn't exist even though others may believe in them?
  ","
  it doesn't exist for them, no. it may exist for others if those people believe in them, but if you don't personally believe in something, then it is false. these concepts usually happen when people are discussing spiritual or religious beliefs. everyone has their own idea of what or how life is, and everyone is entitled to their opinion.
  "
399355,"
   What is a relationship deal breaker for you?
  ","
  cheating, lying, manipulation, ab*se, etc etc. in addition, having bigoted viewpoints or oppressive opinions towards other groups of people is a clear turn-off and i would have no qualms with breaking up with someone if they were racist, for example.
  "
399356,"
   Are you more into looks or brains?
  ","
  someone's personality and intelligence is much more attractive to me than how someone physically looks. obviously physical attraction matters to a degree, but if you don't have emotional chemistry with a person, then the relationship won't last.
  "
399357,"
   Are you saying that just because you don't believe in past lives that past lives aren't true?
  ","
  they're not true to me, no. i don't believe they exist.
  "
399358,"
   Why do some people enjoy life and others don’t?
  ","
  everyone is dealt a different set of cards when it comes to life events, obstacles, personal matters, responsibilities, job prospects, etc etc. some people are happy with their lives, while other people aren't. it's simply a fact that we must come to accept.
  "
399359,"
   Do you listen to other people’s advice, or do you prefer figuring things out yourself?
  ","
  i seldom ask for advice, and i prefer to navigate myself through various obstacles and difficulties because it gives me a better chance of learning from the experience, even if i make a mistake.
  "
399360,"
   So if you don't know who you are then you don't know where you've been in the past before this life
  ","
  you evidently don't understand the fact that i don't believe in the concept of past lives, lol.
  
  it's fine that you do -- i have no qualms with people having their own opinions on life and whatnot. but you should understand that i don't believe past lives exist.
  "
399361,"
   Can you say with certainty the exact time that you became you?
  ","
  i don't know who i am, so no. we've gone through this already.
  "
399362,"
   Sure but isn't what has happened to you in this life also in the past?  Hence a past life?
  ","
  that isn't what a past life is, lol. a past life suggests the possibility that you have lived a life prior to the life you're currently living now, prior to your birth. for example, if you were a different individual living in a different era earlier than this current existence. it generally goes hand-in-hand with reincarnation.
  "
399363,"
   What’s an example of a double standard you see daily? Are you ever a victim of double standards?
  ","
  a very common double standard relates to s*xual activities surrounding the men and women population. when a woman sleeps with more than one or two people, she's considered ""promiscuous"" or a wh*re. however, if a man sleeps with multiple partners, then he's generally praised.
  "
399364,"
   Why don't you believe in past life trauma?  Like, you believe in current life trauma so what's the difference?
  ","
  i don't believe in past lives ... therefore, there would be no existence of trauma associated with past lives.
  "
399365,"
   What was the last difficult thing you were asked to do?
  ","
  create and append a certain spreadsheet with various information at my job, which i had to obtain from a variety of other spreadsheets and compile into one ""master"" spreadsheet, haha. it spanned over the course of the past year or two, so there was a lot of information and it took me a bit of time to grasp the concept and make it.
  "
399366,"
   What is your favorite motivational quote?
  ","
  ""if you're going through hell, keep going.""
  "
399367,"
   Do you think that most of your mental trauma comes from this life or also from past lives lived as well?  Like a carry over from previous existences?

  "
399370,"

  ","
  quite poorly, lmaoo. i have a tendency to suppress my rage until something small sends me over the edge, and then i horribly cope with my anger in self-destructive means.
  
  it's something that has always happened to me, and although it's lessened in severity since going to therapy, it still happens on occasion. i'm definitely not as angry and intense as i used to be compared to when i was in my early 20s.

   Is there ever a nice way to tell someone that they need to lose weight?Or give constructive criticism such as a behavioral issue?
  ","
  eh, it's a very thin line. i believe that one of the few ways it's appropriate to advise someone on how to lose weight if they approach you with the issue first. to outright tell someone they need to lose weight, *especially* if you don't know them very well, is very rude and uncalled for.
  "
399376,"
   When was the last time you had a milkshake?! What was it?!

  "
399381,"
   Do you think happiness comes to people, or should people fight and seek happiness?
  ","
  happiness isn't something that's automatic for the most part, unless you're one of those rare individuals who are always happy for whatever reason. i believe that people should try to find their own happiness in the little things that bring them joy, whether it's through work, relationships, family, hobbies, religion, etc etc.

   If you were born in another era, when would that period in history be and why?
  ","
  i don't believe i would want to be born in a different era. sure, things are terrible in current times but they're much more tolerable than in previous eras. considering who i am (female, non-binary, mentally ill, bisexual, etc etc), there would be a lot more discrimination that i would face.

  i think cancel culture can be justified in some cases, but also unjustified in other cases. people have the capabilities of realizing their wrongdoings, apologizing, and working to improve themselves. if that person is working to improve themselves based on being called out for something they did wrong, i don't really think that warrants them being ""canceled.""
  
  in other cases, i do believe it's right to stop supporting a person, especially in cases of ab*se or discriminatory/oppressive behavior that is repeated with no apology whatsoever.

  male and female are sexes. they aren't genders.

  "
399495,"

  everyone defines their gender in their own way, and gender exists in a spectrum in my eyes. you can 100% identify as a man or a woman, or you can be genderfluid or non-binary or anywhere in between.

  it was a lot of fun, and a complete surprise because he never spoke a word of it -- which is unusual because he can never keep things like that a secret, LOL. we spent the night in a hotel in the same area and got high and watched ancient aliens for the rest of the night. :'))

   Are you trying to please them?

  if they're important to my friend, then it's important to me that i come off as a good friend. so in a way, yes. not so much pleasing them personally as much as it is looking out for my own friend (and also me gauging the other person to make sure they're a good person too).

  no, i've learned to accept my mistakes and misguided thoughts. to be stubborn in the face of your own faults isn't healthy, and there's no excuse in defending yourself and digging yourself a deeper hole when others point out that you're wrong. it's easier to accept your wrongdoings, learn from them, and move on.

  unfortunately, it *has* become normalized in society -- which is bad because it only increases the stigma around mental illness, making people out to be ""crazy"" if they display any sort of different personality traits than what's considered normal. mentally ill people have been chastised for being ""crazy"" for so long, and in the long term, it's damaging.

  in a healthy relationship, some pros would be having someone to talk to about your issues and struggles with no judgment, being comfortable enough to be silly with your partner, having fun with your partner, considering your partner your best friend as well as your lover, and being motivated by your partner to be the best version of yourself you can possibly be.
  
  there really shouldn't be any cons to being in a relationship. sure, arguments do happen occasionally but you both should be working towards the same goals. if your partner is making you feel bad, if they're controlling you, or downright being ab*sive and manipulative, then that isn't healthy.

  self-motivation is essential for people who want to be somewhere else, whether in a physical or metaphorical sense. you need to truly want it for yourself and be motivated enough to pursue whatever it is you want, which also includes creating the resources you need.
  
  it does happen to people, quite often actually. if you have a goal that you're seeking and have the strength and capability to pursue and accomplish it, then nothing can stand in your way.

Some people say it is, but I'm just not attracted to them.

  "
399702,"
   Do you believe in love at first sight?

  i don't follow people upon request, sorry.
  "
399719,"
   Do you get things done early or do you procrastinate?
  ","
  i try to get things done early. if there's one thing that college has taught me, it's that it's best to get things done early so that you're not extremely anxious and rushed towards the end. work is done better when you're not posed with an irrational deadline.
  "
399720,"
   would you ever help someone even in the slightest way to die if thats what they wanted? also, what would you say to someone who approached you with such a topic?

  definitely not. based on personal experience, i've learned that life is ultimately worth experiencing regardless of what trauma you've endured. you should be willing to give yourself a second chance at living because life is wholly unpredictable and you simply don't know when things will turn out for the better.

  both? i can be extremely insensitive towards myself and my feelings, but i also try to take out of my day or week for self-care. whether it's enjoying a beer or glass of wine at the end of the night, or taking an extra long hot shower, or treating myself to one of my favorite coffees after work.

  it *could* be a red flag, sure. name-calling in general is just immature, and it's very disrespectful to your partner if you're calling them names during an argument. relationships should ideally be about open communication, and if you resort to calling your partner names as a defense mechanism, then that's very unhealthy.

  sorta in the middle? i'm not necessarily living paycheck-to-paycheck these days, but i'm obviously not overflowing with money either. i have some expenses coming up that i'm not sure i can afford alongside rent and food and whatnot, so we'll see what happens.

  ","
  i just know it's derived from the stevia plant.
  "
399853,"
   where does your motivation come from?
  ","
  i'm not entirely sure, tbh. i've always been motivated to a certain extent, whether it's to improve a relationship with someone to whom i'm attached, to better myself, or to prove myself at my job and/or school.
  "
399854,"
   Are you uncomfortable revealing the magazine you work with lest it divulge where you work?
  ","
  well yeah, i've never spoken about the title of my company, what colleges i attended, or where i live.
  "
399855,"
   when you buy new things what do you do with the old stuff?
  ","
  i didn't have any old blankets to get rid of, so i didn't do anything in this scenario. but if i'm buying new clothing, sometimes i'll get rid of old clothing just to make my closet less cluttered.
  "
399856,"
   How much is a standard coffee where you buy them?
  ","
  i think a large regular coffee from starbucks is $3.

  "
399858,"
   What magazine are you contributing to and working with?

  it's my job's magazine. i'm not comfortable releasing the name of the magazine, it's just one of the products my job offers alongside various other editorial content.
  "
399859,"
   What are you anxious about?

  i have generalized anxiety disorder, so pretty much everything makes me anxious to some extent.

  ","
  mental illness, lmaoo.
  "
399862,"
   how are you feeling today?
  ","
  i'm a bit anxious at the moment, but otherwise fine. i'm worried about my car, i'm worried about finances, and i'm worried about what my supervisor will think of my ""letter from the editor"" that i wrote today for the newest edition of my job's magazine that's currently in production.
  "
399863,"
   have you ever gotten to a point where you enjoy nothing at all?
  ","
  yes, i've experience apathy to various degrees -- especially at the height of my depression. nothing brought me joy, and everything was meaningless.
  "
399864,"
   are you afraid of death?
  ","
  no, i'm not afraid of death. i'm obsessively intrigued by death and it's often the subject of my creative writing.
  "
399865,"
   what is the last thing you learned?
  ","
  how to tell if a tire needs to be changed based on the degree of tread left on the tire. it won't pass inspection if it's too eroded, and if you use a penny and place it in the tread, if it doesn't reach a certain height, then you need a new tire.
  "
399866,"
   do you like attention or not? talk about how receiving attention makes you feel.
  ","
  i only like receiving attention from certain people, and elevated degrees of attention from others (i.e. strangers) makes me uncomfortable.
  "
399867,"
   have you always been open about talking about yourself? was there a time in your life when that was not the case? if so what changed?
  ","
  i've only been open about my life for the past few years, and prior to that, i was extremely closed off and private. my paranoia was at its all-time high during those times and i was afraid that people would know *too* much about me to the point where it would hurt me.
  
  seeking help for mental illness and understanding that there is such a stigma against the mentally ill changed that, and it made me become passionate about speaking about my experiences in order to help others.
  "
399868,"
   what is worse people slowly drifting out of your life or them just suddenly disappearing?
  ","
  i think it's worse when people abruptly disappear. there's no sense of understanding or closure when that happens, and it makes you wonder if you did anything significantly wrong in order to warrant someone cutting you off to that degree.
  "
399869,"
   Have you ever dyed your hair ? If you have what’s your favourite colour you’ve been?
  ","
  i've been coloring my hair consistently since i was 11 years old. i've been bright red, dark red, orange, blonde, bright blue, bright purple, dark purple, black, and various shades of brown.
  
  my favorite color changes depending on my mood, which is why my hair is constantly changing. right now, it's brown and i'm going to be making it slightly darker with some overtone later this week.
  "
399870,"
   hiii, how are you? i’m following you, can you follow me back??

  i don't follow people upon request, sorry. i seldom follow new people.

  "
399871,"
   Do you have road rage when you drive

  no, i don't experience road rage. driving is a major source of anxiety for me, so i'm a very cautious driver and if someone else does something stupid, then i'll be a bit annoyed but that's all. my main concern is safety.
  "
399872,"
   how many times a day do you check your email and would you rather see no new messages?

  "
399873,"
   do you have a doorbell or a buzzer to your place? how do you feel when you hear it? what about your phone, how do you feel when it rings?
  ","
  we have a doorbell, yeah. i'm always confused whenever it rings because no one ever comes to the house unexpected, but it's happened a few times with delivery people (whether food delivery or UPS, or something).
  
  it doesn't bother me if my phone rings because 99% of the time, it's spam and i don't answer it. i only answer phone calls to numbers i recognize.
  "
399874,"
   are you an organized or messy person? how important is having is having everything very neat to you?
  ","
  i'm an organized person because it's much better for my mental health. i'm less anxious when everything is in its rightful place, and i notice that if i do allow things to get cluttered, it's an indication that my depression might be slipping back in.
  "
399875,"
   how clean is your car and home? do you maintain a certain level of cleanliness all the time or do you just clean when it gets to be a mess?
  ","
  i like cleaning routinely, and i prefer clean and organized living spaces. too much mess or clutter makes me really anxious and claustrophobic, so i always pick up after myself whenever possible.
  
  when it comes to household chores, my roommates and i take turns with the cleaning, but i do have a tendency to do a little extra around the house even after they're done with their part, lmaoo.
  "
399876,"
   do you wish you had help with your day to day affairs, chores, errands, etc? or do you prefer to handle things on your own even if you had the help available?
  ","
  i prefer to handle things on my own whenever possible. i never ask for help with anything because i don't want to appear needy or dependent on anyone, with the obvious exceptions of when i'm too sick to move.
  
  i even felt bad asking my roommate to bring me a glass of water when i had the stomach virus two weeks ago, lmaoo.
  "
399877,"
   do you trust people to do things or do you worry they will mess things up and you will have to end up doing it yourself/fix it anyway?
  ","
  i don't trust people to do things, unless it's something that i'm not skilled in, like people who are mechanics, construction workers, etc etc. when it comes to personal projects, i prefer to take on the projects solo because i don't trust that others won't make mistakes.
  
  it's why i had a huge problem with group projects when i was in school, and i would usually take control of most of the project myself because i didn't want my grade on the line.
  "

  one of my coworkers has never let me down, although i've only known her for less than two years. she's one of the sweetest, most genuine, and selfless people i've ever met and she gives the world to everyone in her life.
  "
399879,"
   what is the last mistake that you made? do you dwell on your past mistakes?
  ","
  the last mistake i made was vaping when i was sick with a stomach virus, lmaoo. it isn't a huge mistake by any means, but it definitely made me feel sicker because i wasn't ready to begin with nicotine again yet.
  
  i try not to dwell on past mistakes, especially those that cannot be changed or fixed. it's negative energy, and i'm trying to rid my life of negative energy.
  "
399880,"
   can you remember what it feels like to not be so anxious? or is that alien to you at this point?
  ","
  i'm definitely not as anxious now as i used to be in the past, but i still experience *some* degree of anxiety. this is the least anxious i've ever been in my entire life -- throughout the rest of my life, i was anxious to the point where it was debilitating.
  "
399881,"
   when was the last time you were not on any psychiatric medication? what do you think would happen if you got off them? have you tried this in the past? would you ever just to see how you felt?
  ","
  i've been on psychiatric medication for three years now. if i stopped taking them (or my antidepressant, at the very least), i feel as if i would fall into a severe depressive episode and begin having panic attacks again. my medication soothes and quells most of my symptoms, ranging from depressive episodes to severe mood swings to anxiety to panic attacks, etc etc.
  
  i wouldn't want to risk it, tbh. i've been doing so well on medication that i know it would have a bad, detrimental effect on my well being if i abruptly stopped taking them.
  "
399882,"
   Happy Monday! We’re almost half way through January. Anyone got any cool plans coming up?

   Thoughts on people who are kiss asses in work
  ","
  i can understand why those people feel the need to do so, but i also respect people more if they're outspoken about what they believe (regarding if there are more efficient ways to do things, etc). if you're solely placating a superior in order to get on their good side for your own personal gain, even if you don't agree with them, then i don't really find much respect in that.

   Would you rather go to a music festival, have fun and sleep in a tent, or stay home, watch TV series and have some tasty snacks?

  i would much rather stay home, watch television, and eat snacks, lmaoo. music shows are fun and everything, but i've never been to a festival before and the idea of one freaks me out because of my social anxiety. i can't be around crowds of people.

  don't pursue a friendship/relationship with someone who doesn't put in the same effort into maintaining the relationship as you do. you don't deserve to have a one-sided relationship, and those who truly care about you will reach out towards you if they sense something is wrong. not everyone is perfect, but people will make time for those they care about in one way or another, even if it's something as simple as texting consistently one night or a phone call.

  no one deserves to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't reciprocate the same effort you're putting into the relationship, and someone doesn't deserve you if you take advantage of the relationship and don't put enough effort in either. relationships should be a mutual exchange of time, effort, and energy, and it will only succeed if you're both striving to better yourself and the other person with constant support and reassurance.

   Would you ever go vegetarian/vegan? ?
  ","
  i've considered going vegetarian when i was younger, but meat is basically a staple in my diet because it's an easy form of protein. i do try to buy alternatives whenever possible, though.
  "

   When did you know you were genuinely happy?
  ","
  i've struggled with depression for more than half of my life, so i don't believe i've ever been *genuinely* happy. there are things that bring me pleasure, but the depression is always lurking in the background.
  "
399950,"
   What's the craziest thing you've done for someone you love?
  ","
  i don't like when people use the term ""crazy"" to refer to something wild or ridiculous, it's directly stigmatizing against those who struggle with mental illness.
  
  however, the most wild thing i've ever done for someone i loved was probably move 300 miles back home just so i could be with them during their time of need.
  "
399951,"
   Is there someone who when you first met them you didn’t like them however as you got to know them you ended up becoming very good friends?

   sorry to hear about the dog. dying pets are such a heartbreak because they cannot tell you how they feel exactly. do you trust the shop that told you that you need new tires? i know you had said tread. can you just rotate them and put more miles on them for a while?
  ","
  my brother was the one who told me i needed at least one new tire, he recommended two because it's best to buy them in pairs. he's been a mechanic for 15+ years. the tread on one of my back tires is completely shot and i can't drive on it for much longer without it going completely flat.
  
  another 5 days driving on it won't be a big deal as long as i keep an eye on the tire pressure and fill it up if my tire pressure light comes back on. the tires should arrive on tuesday, and then i'm taking my car and the tires to my regular mechanic on saturday.

  when people talk over you while you're in the middle of speaking, it shows they don't respect or care about what you have to say and they just want to put their two cents in with no regard to anyone else.
  
  i also get angry when people try to push their beliefs onto me (or others) because, again, it shows a lack of respect.

   If intelligent extra-terrestrial life was discovered, how do you think humanity would react?

  i think that extraterrestrial life has already been discovered, but it's being kept secret by governments because the reality of the situations being leaked to the public would cause a mass frenzy.
  "
400070,"
   Do you think social media platforms manipulate people? If yes then, how so?
  ","
  the platforms themselves don't manipulate people, but the way other people can use them do. on social media, people often present their ideal selves instead of their realistic selves, posting about their accomplishments instead of their downfalls and basically pretending that they're happy if they're really not.
  
  it can lead to a lot of insecurity about one's own accomplishments, where people think they're not good enough or they haven't reached milestones in their lives in a timely manner.
  "
400071,"
   Does jealousy harm relationships?
  ","
  yes, i do think that jealousy can harm a relationship. if you're jealous of your partner's friendships towards other people or towards themselves in general, then that's a toxic emotion and something you need to work through within yourself. you have to come to an understanding of where the jealousy stems from, otherwise if you give into it, it could lead to a lot of arguments and misunderstanding.

  ","
  i don't think it's wrong for you not to go, but perhaps you can come to a compromise with your partner because i'm sure it would leave a great impression on his family if you did show your face. perhaps you can stay for only a small period of time instead of the entire ordeal so that you're not too overwhelmed for multiple hours on end.

  ","
  my years of battling with self harm and a s*icide attempt when i was younger. i'm not proud of myself that i endured such things, but i also don't believe they're not anything to be ashamed of because there's already such a stigma against those unhealthy coping mechanisms and a misunderstanding behind s*icide in general.

   although younger people are often assumed to be more progressive, new research has shown the number of americans ages 18-34 (millennials & gen zers) who are comfortable interacting w/ LGBTQ people is just 45%, a drop from 53% in 2018, and 63% in 2016. why do you think this is?
  ","
  that's interesting to read and compelling, especially considering the younger generations are typically shown to be more tolerant and open-minded in terms of sexual orientation and gender.
  
  i'm reading an article on the statistics now, and one theory proposed is that the reason those numbers are on the decline is because of the major increase in violent acts against people from the lgbtq+ community, particularly acts of violence against black trans women. the FBI released a study that showed an estimated 17% increase in hate crimes against lgbtq+ individuals in 2017, and of 7175 crimes, over 1200 were based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

   In what specific ways did therapy help you? How did things change for you?

  going to therapy has taught me different, healthier, methods of coping with illness and pain compared to what i conditioned myself into doing for years upon years. conversing with my therapist brought to light different aspects and reasons behind my behavior that i never considered before, and because of that awareness, i have a better handle on my behavior and how to control it before it's too late.

  i'm supposed to bring my car to my brother's mechanic shop tomorrow and i already have anxiety over it, even though i have somewhat of an idea of where it is and the town isn't anything new to me. but the idea of driving out there is giving me major anxiety.

  LOL, i totally get it.
  
  well, i've always been open about my past trauma on askfm in general. i was physically & verbally ab*sed by my parents for over a decade, which obviously is the root cause of all of my mental illnesses (probably also some genetic factors thrown in there too). my family has always been dysfunctional.
  "
400221,"
   i just want to say that i have a tremendous amount of respect for you. just like a feeling i cant even put into words. just like a sensation that makes me sad to think that other people feel like i do and its just heartbreaking. that doesnt even make sense but knowing others feel this is even worse.
  ","
  i totally understand how you feel, don't worry. it's comforting but heartbreaking all at the same time. but that's what people like us need to do to get by -- to talk about our experiences and show others that they're not alone so that they don't try something drastic that they'll regret.
  
  i went over a decade without mental health treatment. i've been in treatment for about 3 or 4 years now (can't remember at this point). i first started displaying mental illness around the age of 11, and there was a stint of therapy for about 6 months when i was 14, but it didn't last long and did nothing for me. i struggled through a s*icide attempt, years of self harm, and anguish before finally deciding to seek formal help when i outlined a plan for my own death at the age of 24/25.

  ","
  no, they were likely stewing inside of you for quite a number of years prior to your official diagnosis. it's unfortunate that it took a s*icide attempt for someone to come to a diagnosis and treatment plan, but nevertheless, it doesn't mean you didn't have those illnesses.
  
  when i say that i won't tell someone i have a mental illness without being diagnosed with it officially, it doesn't mean that i didn't have suspicions that it was there. but that's all it is -- a suspicion. you can say that you display symptoms of something, but you're not sure if you have something because you're not a mental health professional.

  intelligence has nothing to do with mental illness. and i don't pay much attention to people who self-diagnose because it's not accurate most of the time. i'll never claim to have a disorder that i've never been professional diagnosed with.
  "
400228,"
   i used to honestly feel like i could be content never seeing another person again for the rest of my life as long as i had  disordered coping mechanisms. but now even that is not enough and life has become quite confusing to me. ive never been this bad. i had worse moments but not this steadily bad.
  ","
  i feel this completely, man. i can feel myself spiraling again in light of everything that's been going on in the past week alone, things i have zero control over. i just want to be out of my mind as soon as i'm out of work. i don't want to cope with reality, and i can't even find solace in my dreams because they're just as distressing lately.

400231,"
   im just like you in this way. my solution to this has been to isolate myself from everyone over the years. its the only logical thing to me.

  i can't do that, honestly. i've tried isolating myself but i become so desperate for human contact that i go against my own promises and contact other people anyway. i've tried testing others by not texting them for periods of time to see if they'll contact me first, but i always cave in.
  "
400232,"
   does doing activities like chores or organizing help you in a calming way?
  ","
  chores/organizing doesn't calm me down or anything, but i enjoy the feeling of having a fresh and clean living space when everything is done.
  "
400233,"
   is this a flaw or a gift? ultimatlely does the massive amount that you care about taking care of others have a negative affect on your mental health eventually? like eventually people will let you down because they cannot return the same energy you put out?
  ","
  it has a detrimental effect on my mental health because when someone doesn't reciprocate the same energy, i take it super personally and can become resentful towards that person.
  "
400234,"
   What household chores are you expected to do on weekends?

400236,"
   do other peoples specific mental health issues interest you or does hearing about them seem like a its a competition of desperation or just bring you down in general?
  ","
  no, i never have seen it as a competition to see who has it worse or anything. people in the mental health community need to stick to one another in terms of having mutual support, and my ears are open to anyone who's struggling because i've been there before and i like letting people know that they're not alone and help is always available.
  "
400237,"
   do you feel as though these are truly reciprocated back to you in your life by others?
  ","
  sometimes, but not all of the time. i invest too much energy in others who don't invest the same energy in return, but it's simply a part of who i am. i feel things too deeply, i take things too emotionally, and i become very attached to people.
  "
400238,"
   have you ever had any experience with eating disorders?
  ","
  i've had disordered eating habits, but i wouldn't classify myself as having an eating disorder really. i've refrained from eating despite being hungry in order to lose weight, but it never lasted very long because of hypoglycemia. i've skipped meals purposely to get drunk faster if i knew i was going to be drinking that night.
  "
400239,"
   have you ever felt like there is no joy whatsoever in anything? like nothing matters and you question every action or idea you have to the point you feel lost beyond return? what can you do?

  ","
  uh, yeah? men can be friends with women regardless of who's in a relationship with who. if you don't trust your boyfriend/husband to be friends with other women, then there's something much deeper going on with the lack of trust you have in your partner and you probably shouldn't be with them in the first place.
  
  to control who your partner is friends with is super manipulative, too.
  "
400247,"

  ","
  well, these are significant worries so they do matter. i don't really feel like going into what's going wrong with things in my life at the moment because they're personal things, but combined with my poor mental health, it's making everything else in my life (like work, for example) seem so mundane.

  mental health isn't getting worse overall. mental health has always existed, and it's only recently that it's begun to be less stigmatized in society. people are talking about it more because they will not be k*lled, locked up, or chastised for talking about mental illness.
  
  ""big pharma"" doesn't exist either. medication has been proven to help individuals in several different ways, and there's nothing wrong with taking medication to aid in mental health recovery. thousands of people have gone into full remission thanks to medication.

  you're questioning the expertise of psychologists, psychiatrists, licensed clinical social workers and mental health counselors, etc etc., by calling them ""so-called experts."" those people, above all else, determine the degree to which an individual is mentally ill and treats them accordingly. it isn't your authority to question the expertise of those individuals, and in doing so, you're questioning the plausibility of other people's mental illnesses as well.
  
  not to mention the fact that you've personally questioned my own mental illnesses, as well as the mental illnesses of others, and have tried to chalk them up to normal behavior when they're clinically abnormal.

400328,"
   I don't believe I'm smarter than everyone else.  It's just my opinion, I don't cling to it like you do with your assumptions and ideologies. For every expert, there is another expert who will disagree with them so no one is 100% right.  It's all speculation
  ","
  people who disagree with the plausibility of mental illness are not experts on the subject, and that goes for most areas of medicine. medicine does advance every day, but even so, it's your attitude that is most bothersome because you still will not admit that you've done wrong.
  
  over the course of the past few months (or longer?), i've seen you question others on askfm who are also mentally ill, and one by one, you've been shot down. i entertained your gig for a while, but it's time for you to acknowledge that your perception is problematic.

  that isn't condescending. mentally ill isn't an ableist word, and it's correct to call out ableism when i see it. it's unfortunate that you simply cannot own up to your mistakes, but what else is new from an anon who believes they're smarter than everyone else. lmaoo.

  a lot of people are ableist and they're unaware that they're being ableist. that's why i said i've tried educating you in the past, but you won't listen.
  
  you armchair diagnose people. you use outdated, stigmatized terms like ""insanity"" and ""psychopathy"" to refer to mental illnesses. you question the authority of mental health practitioners who know more about mental illnesses and general medicine than you do. your attitude and tone of voice is extremely condescending and does nothing but cast doubt on everyone who's mentally ill to whom you ask these questions.
  "
400331,"
   No one is truly an expert because no one knows everything about everything
  ","
  you don't have to know everything about everything in order to be considered an expert in your field.
  
  also, your ableist attitude toward those with mental illnesses and practitioners who specialize in mental health is becoming quite alarming. i understand your need for inquisition, because psychology is indeed a fascinating subject, but perhaps think of your audience and your tone of voice before questioning the behaviors of people. i've tried to educate you in the past on mental illness, but apparently nothing i said has stuck in your mind, otherwise you wouldn't be behaving in this fashion.
  "

  i generally have negative feelings towards settling for someone because it makes me think that a person isn't striving to better themselves or their partner because they're simply comfortable. i don't think you should ever settle -- you should continue to improve, both yourself and your partner, and you both should be growing continuously together in harmony.

  i think some people do genuinely heal and recover, but it takes a hell of a lot of self-actualization, support, and in some cases, privilege, because not everyone has the means or financial capabilities to become invested in addiction rehab programs (as an example).
  
  the mental health system in general, in the united states at least, is also subpar because even with the most at-risk individuals, people are released far too early in some cases and they cannot complete their programs, which leads to relapse.

400417,"
   are you fearful of the future or do you welcome it with high expectations?
  ","
  neither, really. while i'm not fearful of what the future holds, i also don't have high expectations for the future. i'm simply taking each day as they come and striving to work to the best of my ability. as long as you can confidently say that you've put your best effort into making every day the best you can make it at that present moment, then the future should be easier to handle.

  i'm not too sure how to approach the subject with them, tbh. if i even should bring it up at all. i'm afraid that i'm going to end up pissing them off and trigger more bad behavior from them if i tell them the way i see things, and i wouldn't want them to cause themselves or anyone else harm. i also don't want to leave it entirely alone because then that's also enabling the behavior.

  true crime shows are just documentation of crimes that have already been famous to a certain degree. while they definitely do escalate interest in the cases, such as in the case with the documentary ""don't f**k with cats,"" it isn't as if the offenders are being sympathized with or anything. they're showing the case according to facts and figures.

  attraction is more than just physical attraction, though. even though he's physically attractive, the fact that i'm emotionally attracted to him as well only ""enhances"" his looks to me, and in that regard, then there's no one else out there who is more attractive to me than he is.

  however, it was close to exactly three years ago that i first began seeking help for mental illness because i was afraid i was going to take it too far. fast forward to the present day, and i have much healthier coping mechanisms, a strong support system, and i live independently away from my parents, who have always been the main source of instability in my life. i have a better job that gives me pride and a sense of productivity, and my panic disorder is basically in remission.

  i finished season two the other day -- and holy crap, i was screaming at the final 2-3 episodes. i don't want to give anything away because i'm sure i have some followers who haven't finished it yet, but the ending of the second season made me go out and buy the books that the series was based off of.

  ","
  no, i believe that toys are just toys and they shouldn't be gendered one way or the other. the generations prior to us, like our parents and grandparents, were raised with such gender stereotypes that anything that exists out of the binary of male vs. female sex is unfathomable to them.
  
  i don't blame you for being angry, for one because your mother in law is reinforcing gender stereotypes, but also because she sounds like she's also backhandedly downgrading your parenting skills. there's nothing wrong with boys playing with pots, pans, and spoons or girls playing with balls and cars.

   Are you confrontational?

  i am when i absolutely have to be, especially if a friend is doing something wrong that i know is going to hurt them in the end. other than that, i'm very non-confrontational and only wish to keep the peace and a mutual understanding.

   What makes you feel accomplished?
  ","
  -- writing something to its completion, doing some post-writing copyediting, and feeling confident enough with the piece to post it online for others to read.
  
  -- going to work and putting in a full 8 hours, keeping busy the entire day, and getting a lot of assignments done, while also making progress with the magazine i manage.
  
  -- going shopping and cleaning the house all in the same day (which usually happens on sundays). it gives me a sense of accomplishment knowing that the house is filled with good food and that everything is clean, spotless, and organized.

   Can you pin point the moment in your life where you were the happiest?
  ","
  i'm not sure what my happiest moment in my life was. but one of the most recent happy moments was the day i moved out of my parents' house and established my independent life in my own house with two roommates.
  
  the feeling of independence and freedom and happiness is indescribable. my coworkers always tell me how much more content i seem at work and motivated to push forward to another day, knowing that i'm not afraid to go home anymore. i have so much down time for myself, i have time to write and read and draw, and things have improved so much for me mentally since i moved out.

  that's adorable !! my cousin did the same thing with one of her cats. we were driving somewhere late at night and the cat, she was a kitten at the time, was wandering in the middle of the street. so we scooped her, took her to the emergency vet, and after no one claimed her after a few days, they said my cousin could take her home. she named her faith.
  "
400565,"
   Would you ever take back someone who cheated?
  ","
  i took back my boyfriend who had cheated on me much earlier in our relationship, but it took a while for me to establish enough trust in him again to continue moving forward.
  
  if he cheated on me again in the current age, though, i would end the relationship. i'm too old to be playing mind games with people.

400570,"
   In what way is your romantic love different from your platonic love?
  ","
  well, romantic love means that i'm head over heels in love with my boyfriend -- being *in love* is much different than simply loving someone. platonically loving my friends, however, means that i do love them but there is no attraction involved.
  "
400571,"
   Which is more important to you....... platonic love or romantic love?
  ","
  they're equally as important to me for different reasons. romantic love is beautiful and wonderful, but platonic love is equally as important because it's healthy to have supportive friends and unconditional love from both your friends and partner.
  "
400572,"
   Favorite animal to own as a pet?
  ","
  i've always loved dogs from the very beginning. through my boyfriend, i've also developed a love for fish and for lizards. and now through living with my roommates, i've loved living with cats.
  "
400573,"
   Is there other love in your life apart from just the romantic love you experience with your partner?
  ","
  of course. i experience platonic love with my close friends.
  "
400574,"
   Can you explain how you saw love as transcending all rational thought and meaning?
  ","
  i thought that once you loved someone, that was it -- you lived happily ever after, and you did not experience any strife with your partner, that you and your partner were soul mates from the very beginning and everything would work in your favor.
  "
400575,"
   Are you religious or spiritual?
  ","
  i'm not religious and never have been religious. and i did go through a period of time where i *was* spiritual and looked into eastern spiritual ideologies that reflected my thoughts best.
  
  these days, not so much. i don't care much for religion or spirituality and i don't care enough to put a title on my beliefs.
  "
400576,"
   Have you always had a certain idea of what love is or has it changed for you over time?
  ","
  before i fell in love, i had a very unrealistic, fantasy-like idea of love that transcended all rational thought and meaning. as i've grown older and discovered what love truly is, i've realized that love encompasses both passion and heartache, togetherness and loss, and the overall ability to work together through never-ending obstacles while coming out stronger at the other side (even if there are hurdles along the way).
  
  love is not all cute picnics and fairy tales and happiness. love can be difficult and downright overwhelming at times, but it's through communication and an acceptance of your partner, despite their flaws, that ultimately makes things work.
  "
400577,"
   How do you feel about sharing your password with your partner?
  ","
  i have no qualms against sharing passwords with my partner because i have nothing to hide. i can understand why some couples do not share passwords, though. it's healthy to have your own life aside from your relationship.
  "
400578,"
   What would you do if your parents didn’t like your partner?
  ","
  it wouldn't make a difference to me. i'm here to lead my own life, not the life my parents expect of me, and i'm free to make my own decisions regardless of what they think of my partner. if they don't like my partner, then they have the option to not associate with them -- but i'll continue to date them as long as the relationship continues to serve me.

  yes, my job makes me incredibly happy and i feel productive at the end of each work day. i have beautiful co-workers who inspire and encourage me to keep moving forward, and my supervisor is a blessing.
  "
400581,"
   How would you describe your best friend?
  ","
  a genuine warrior, through and through. she has been through so much hardship and loss throughout her life, year after heartbreaking year, but she still finds renewed motivation within herself despite her struggles and has risen her way to the top with grace.
  "
400582,"
   I honestly feel that to be honest - It sounds like you’d want to be reached out to but people just aren’t there. That makes it hard.. Just remember people love you nevertheless, and that you’re not alone okay?
  ","
  thank you, this means a lot to me. :'))
  
  i do like when people reach out, but i often give off the impression that i'm perfectly fine because i also don't want others to worry about me. but occasionally, i'll have really bad nights and text my friends ""i'm not doing okay"" and i'll get no response because it's like ... midnight, or something. meh.

   If you are in a bad mood, do you prefer to be left alone or have someone to cheer you up?
  ","
  when i'm in a bad mood, i prefer to be left alone because i get disappointed when i try to reach out to others and no one answers me right away (to be fair, it normally happens super late at night when everyone else is asleep :/).
  "
400585,"
   What do you think of best friends of the opposite sex?
  ","
  i don't believe a person's sex or gender means anything when it comes to who you're friends with. you can be close friends, and even best friends, with anyone as long as you don't give their sex or gender any significance or treat them differently because of their sex or gender.
  "
400586,"
   When was the last time you actually took a poop??
  ","
  a few hours ago, if that's something you certainly must know.
  "
400587,"
   Do you consider yourself an introvert or an extrovert?
  ","
  i'm more of an ""extroverted introvert."" which means that while i am an introvert at heart and need time to recharge in between being around groups of people, i'm also very comfortable and willing to be with a small group of people if i'm in the mood to do so. i like socializing to a certain extent, but it can only happen in small spurts -- otherwise i get overwhelmed.
  "
400588,"
   Did you ever write a journal?
  ","
  yes, i wrote in a diary frequently when i was a young teenager. i confided in my journal, wrote poetry in my journal, and explained my anguish and woes because i had no one else around.
  
  i don't have a physical documentation of my every day feelings and concerns anymore. when i was 14 years old, my parents dug through my bedroom, found my journal, and read it front to back. they confronted me about the contents of the journal and i lost all trust that i had in them.
  "
400589,"
   What’s something you can’t go a day without doing?
  ","
  drinking a cup of coffee first thing in the morning. it's my number one priority, first because i thoroughly enjoy coffee and it motivates me to get the day started. and second because i'm addicted to caffeine and i'll go through withdrawals if i don't have caffeine prior to 3:00pm, lmaoo.
  "
400590,"
   Even if it’s someone you dislike?
  ","
  this isn't really relevant because there are not many people i dislike, and those i dislike are quite distant from me.
  "
400591,"
   What’s your favorite hobby to do alone?
  ","
  all of my hobbies, i like doing alone. i listen to music alone, i draw/paint alone, i play video games alone, i read alone, and i write alone. there's a certain freedom in doing things in solitude and it brings me great peace when there is no one around me.
  "
400592,"
   Answer honestly are you selfish?
  ","
  i'm selfish when i need to be, but i'm mostly selfless and often disregard my own needs if someone else is hurting or needs help with something.
  "
400593,"
   If you could do one thing without suffering the consequences, what would
you do?
  ","
  unspeakable, non-law abiding things that would implicate me if i discussed them any further.
  "
400594,"
   What’s your biggest pet peeve?
  ","
  my biggest pet peeve is when people interrupt me while i'm talking to give their input instead of waiting until i'm finished. this also goes for anyone who does this to anyone else -- not allowing someone to finish what they're saying in order to tell everyone something more related to them instead of the original person. i find it to be so rude.
  "
400595,"
   Do you think your boyfriend is your weakness or strength?
  ","
  he is my ultimate strength. granted, we've gotten into some sticky situations together in the past, but overall he has made me a much better person than who i used to be based on his unconditional love and support of all of my endeavors.
  "
400596,"
   What is one dream you have yet to accomplish?
  ","
  my ultimate, number one dream is to publish a book -- whether it's a book of short stories, a full-fledged novel, or a book of poetry. now that i've been trying to write consistently (these days, poetry and personal essays), i want to try to compile them into a book of sorts and eventually get published.
  "
400597,"
   What accomplishment are you most proud of?
  ","
  graduating from college. my high school and college years were extremely difficult for me for various reasons (mental health, alcohol, drugs, etc etc), but i always had motivation to continue with my education because i knew it would lead to a better life in the future. i graduated college in 2013 with a 3.89 GPA and latin honors.
  "
400598,"
   What is your greatest fear?
  ","
  being abandoned, without reason or explanation, by my boyfriend or the friends closest to me. i honestly don't know what i would do if they cut me out of their lives completely with no warning at all.
  "
400599,"
   Who are five people you are closest with?

  my boyfriend, my best friend, my boyfriend's best friend, another close friend of mine who i basically consider a best friend at this point, and an old coworker from my previous job.

  "
400601,"
   Is there someone you miss but don’t want to text?
  ","
  no, the only people i'm capable of missing are friends that i'm very open with. and if i miss them and/or want to see them, then i have no problem with texting them and chatting.
  "
400602,"
   Who was your favorite teacher and why?
  ","
  i had a forensics teacher in high school who helped me tremendously when i was a student (and even after i had graduated). he was very open about his dark past, including his struggle with drugs and time in the military, and i trusted him enough to confide in him my confusion regarding someone i knew who was addicted to drugs and i didn't know how to help them.
  "
400603,"
   If you had the ability to erase something that you did in the past, what
would it be?

  "
400604,"
   What song makes you unconditionally happy?
  ","
  even though it's more of a repeat of the same song over & over and it's rather somber, i'm most motivated when i listen to the music from the halo 3: ODST soundtrack. right now, i'm listening to this compilation with a backdrop of falling rain ;

400605,"
   What is the strangest dream you’ve ever had?
  ","
  most of my dreams are rather odd, but i cannot remember them past five minutes of waking up from the dream. the only thing left over is my perception and feelings toward the dream itself, but the details totally disappear.
  
  i do have vivid nightmares that still haunt me at times, but they're more morbid and grotesque than strange.
  "
400606,"
   What is the darkest thing someone ever told you?

Counteract it with something positive in your answer.
  ","
  i'm uncomfortable stating what the darkest thing someone has told me is, because it could possibly implicate them and it's personal to them -- i wouldn't want to betray their trust.
  
  however, i also say that regardless of what that person has done and gone through in their life, i fully believe that they're a person worthy of love and respect.
  "
400607,"
   Is it easier to hate or to love? Why?
  ","
  i believe it's emotionally easier to hate someone than it is to love someone -- which is why so many people are filled with hatred instead of opening their hearts and minds to the idea of love. if you've been hurt in the past, it's far easier to disregard and possibly dislike that person, which further taints your relationships with others in the future.
  "
400608,"
   Is it a good thing that originally white characters in comics or movies are being played by people of color?
  ","
  i don't see how that could be a bad thing unless a person's race is central to the story. an example of this is hermione granger from the harry potter series -- her race has never explicitly been explained in the books, so there have been a lot of adaptations where she has been played by an actress who is a person of color.
  "
400609,"
   You think polygami relationship should be legal like other kind of relationship?
  ","
  i fully support polyamorous relationships. if everyone involved in the relationship is happy and things are consensual among everyone involved, then i see absolutely nothing wrong with it.

400610,"
   How is everyone's New Year going so far?
  ","
  the first day of the new year has been good, and quite relaxing (and drama-free!). i slept in this morning until around 11:30am, had breakfast and coffee, and bullsh*tted on my laptop for a few hours while trying to go through my askfm inbox.
  
  afterwards, i got ready to go to my parents' house. i just came home not too long ago. we had dinner together and a ""second christmas"" to give my father his gifts, since he was out of state on christmas eve.
  "
400611,"
   What do you like about yourself that others like or have mentioned about you?
  ","
  on a physical level, people have told me that they like my eyes and my hair, which i agree with. i've always loved the color of my eyes and my hair is unique to me.
  
  on a mental/emotional level, people have told me that i'm very passionate and talented when it comes to my writing. and although i have my doubts about my own writing at times, i do admit that i am proud of some of the works i've written over the years, especially ones that have moved others.
  "
400612,"
   Do you care about hair when you’re dating someone? Do you have a preference, short, long, silky, curly etc?
  ","
  no, hair doesn't much matter to me as long as it's obvious that they maintain it, keep it clean, etc etc. when my boyfriend and i started dating, he had shaggy hair. then as we got older, he grew his hair out to his shoulders. he's had it super short for the past few years.
  "
400613,"
   My boss thinks it's offensive and rude that I don't trust him and he's trying to force me to trust him thoughts on that matter?
  ","
  well, obviously he must have done something wrong in order for you not to trust him. ideally, he should be understanding and receptive toward your feelings and work towards establishing trust again. you cannot force someone to trust you, so his efforts to ""force"" you to trust him will only make matters worse.
  "
400614,"

  a nearly decade-long addiction to self-harm, beginning from when i was around the age of 11. i stopped self-harming when i was 19 or 20 years old, and although i've relapsed a few times since then, it was not to the severity that it was when i was a teenager.

  he can be quite messy at times, but it's also gotten better over the years. he'll throw his clothes on the ground instead of in the hamper, sometimes cups and plates accumulate on the table, etc etc. he used to be *so* much worse when we were younger, but obviously we do learn to pick up after ourselves as we get older.
  "
400631,"
   What are your thoughts on online dating or tinder?
  ","
  i think online dating is a great idea if you're single and you're not quite sure where to look, especially as an adult. but you also have to remain quite hypervigilant about who you choose to talk to or meet because there are dozens of people in this world who prey on others in order to hurt them while giving off the appearance that they're charming.

  i don't know how many items of clothing i own, tbh. i have a closet full of various shirts, blouses, dresses, etc etc. i seldom get rid of things if they still fit me, so my closet is years' accumulation of various pieces.

  his eyes are the hue of a setting sun, speckled with the frost and dew of tree trunks on a warm winter's eve. when there are logs sitting within the flame, they erupt within his face, the sparks reflected in his pupils. his eyes are espresso poured over ice, and the warmth emitting from the cold cup resembles the comfort radiating from his eyes' deepness, their darkness, their unrelenting beauty.

  i'm not entitled to free artwork just because someone is my friend. you're supposed to support your artists friends by buying and/or donating to their work, just like anything else. it's why i bought quite a few pieces of art when i went to my friend's art show last week.
  
  usually artists' primary or secondary source of income is their art, and if you cannot afford to buy their art, then at the very least you can promote it.

  if i'm in the midst of a depressive episode, then tbh nothing i can do will make me feel better. the best thing i can do is try to trudge through the day and make myself feel productive until it's time for me to go to sleep. my episodes can last from days to weeks, and i've come to the understanding that my best might solely be getting out of bed to brush my teeth that day -- and that's perfectly okay.

  "
400736,"
   Any advice for writers who struggle to put their emotions/make story interesting in what they write about?

  for me, writing has always been deeply personal and has made me very vulnerable. it isn't going to move your audience if it doesn't come from a place of sincerity or pain from within yourself. write what you know best -- whether that's through heartache, family issues, relationship issues, trauma, etc etc.
  
  my writing has always been open and honest, and i find that i write my best work when i'm at a state of honesty within myself. you have to really sit there and think about how you're feeling, the source of those feelings, and the past history of those feelings and how they came to fruitation. it's really like you're psychoanalyzing yourself, but applying it to the character or whoever you're writing about.
  "
400737,"
   What book would you recommend for someone to read?
  ","
  it would really depend on what they're already interested in reading or learning more about. i mainly read books like psychological thrillers, drama, and i've also read a few romance novels which weren't really the best but appealed to my soft side (lol).

Happy Holidays/Merry Christmas to all.
  ","
  happy holidays & happy new year !!
  
  i never have had wintertime traditions besides the usual family antics around christmas time. winter is down time for basically everyone since long island is well known for their summer and autumn activities, so i like to spend my winters indoors, being reflective, catching up on my creative hobbies, and spending time with friends.
  "

   What do you wish you cared less about? ?
  ","
  helping people and/or being there for people who won't reciprocate the same feelings or behavior towards me in return. i've always been there for others when they needed a shoulder to cry on, but i often realized that those same people never were there for me in my times of need. i wish sometimes that i cared less about helping other people to preserve my own sense of integrity.

  ","
  without sounding biased, my boyfriend is one of the smartest people i've had the pleasure of knowing. he has a college education, yeah, but what he studied in school is nothing compared to the intelligence he has regarding other areas of his life that he has studied independently.

   What does it mean when your partner asked you a question like, “Are we okay for each other?” Are they having second thoughts or questioning the relationship or what?
  ","
  it could be an indication that they're having second thoughts, but it could also mean that they want to ensure that you're both on the same page in terms of the relationship. it could go either way, and the best way to find out is to simply ask them if there's anything they find wrong with the relationship and/or how to improve upon the relationship.
  
  communication is key. if you're confused by something your partner has said, the best possible thing to do is ask for clarity.
  "
400756,"
   Do you have any regrets? Care to share? ?
  ","
  i have a few regrets, some dealing with the toxic and horrible things i did to people when i was much younger. i also sometimes regret not acting correctly in the face of someone else's vulnerability, not being sensitive enough to other people's needs, and not being enough for certain people (or even being *too much* for others).

  i like talking through my anguish, usually through venting or just to receive some sort of feedback that validates my feelings. sometimes i can act irrationally, so it's good to have some sort of response to ensure that i'm behaving in the right manner.

  yes, i've experienced discrimination based on my sex, gender, and mental illness. when given the opportunity to do so, i try to educate the person. but if they're obviously not open to being educated and are steadfast in their problematic views, i just pay them no mind because their opinion is worthless.

  ","
  nah, i was never a yahoo messenger sort of person. i used AOL.
  "
400775,"
   It depends on how we define ""gamer"". The one who plays games, even if it's one game or the one who has experienced and mastered numerous top video games. I believe that the second definition makes more sense.
  ","
  a gamer is simply a person who enjoys playing video games. there's no deeper meaning behind it. there's more to video games than simply the top-rated games as rated by IGN, for example.
  
  also, not everyone has the privilege of enjoying highly-rated games, and there are multiple consoles and platforms on which to play video games where only certain games are available.
  "
400776,"
   Both quality and quantity matter. No one could call themselves a gamer if they haven't played GTA for example. No matter how good they are at a few particular games, they can't be called gamers based on the norm.
  ","
  lmaoo. that's still not true -- *anyone* can be a gamer, whether they like first person shooters, side scrollers, puzzle games, strategy games, RPGs, MMOs, etc etc.
  
  it's useless and wrong to gatekeep video games and to say that someone isn't a ""real gamer"" if they haven't played certain video games.
  "
400777,"
   This series is one of the masterpieces of gaming. Anyone who calls themselves a gamer should have played one them at least.
  ","
  i disagree. a gamer is simply a person who loves playing video games, regardless of which type of game they enjoy. there are numerous different types of games.

  ","
  god forbid parents have a healthy s*x life despite having children, lol. there's nothing wrong with children (of appropriate age) knowing their parents have healthy and consensual s*x. if anything, it only leads to a greater understanding of what healthy s*x is and more responsible children.

400796,"
   yeah, i think ppl w bpd who take meds take it to alleviate some of the symptoms that come w it since there's a high comorbidity rate w other disorders but the main treatment is therapy which i've started & am in the process of getting on meds. :) also, ik doctors are hesitant to diagnose (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... underage ppl w bpd/ personality disorders (which is understandable) but when i look back, i DEFINITELY started exhibiting classic BPD symptoms at age 14, as well as developed mental illnesses in general that sort of manifested slowly during the onset of puberty (11-14). they should be more open imo.
  
  --
  
  for me personally, medication has been super helpful, but that's also because i've also been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. i'm on four different medications to try to combat each respective disorder, which can be exhausting and the process was grueling, but i'm happy i got to this point. i'm also involved in DBT therapy, which has helped greatly as well. i've been in therapy for a little over two years.
  
  my symptoms related to depression, at the very least, started when i was around 11 years old. i wasn't aware that it was depression at the time, and i only sought help in my 20s when my s*icidal ideation became increasingly severe. after meeting with my old psychiatrist numerous times, she diagnosed me first with personality disorder NOS and then decided on BPD after knowing more of my past history.
  
  most, if not all, personality disorders stem from an early age but i believe doctors are hesitant to diagnose until the age of 18 because teenagers naturally have hormonal imbalances to begin with, which can mimic disorders.

400800,"
   Given that our memories change all the time, how can we ever be sure of what we experienced in the past?
  ","
  this is actually a source of major anxiety for me, as i've always been unable to distinguish reality from fantasy, i.e. what my memories actually are versus what i've dreamed or envisioned. i have had memory loss from an early age and have basically lost over 10 years of my life due to trauma (or at least i assume), so my memories are always really vague.
  
  i'm uncertain of what has happened in my past. i know the ab*se i went through as a teenager, but everything beyond that is unknown to me. and my perception of events has always been in a gray area, so it's difficult for me to ascertain reality and fiction.

   i feel u on the fp thing completely, been there done that w multiple people, some were short term, one was long term for abt 5 years but we haven't spoken in almost a year (i isolated myself from friends after graduating hs due to depression) & in the long run it feels so much better (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... to not be dependant on a person's validation like that. sometimes i wish bpd was like other disorders & you could just take a pill to alleviate it. i just want it out of my head for good. the brain is ridiculous sometimes with what it does lol.
  
  --
  
  yeah, it's funny (well ... not really), when i was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago when i was like 24/25 years old, i began realizing how many FP i had over the course of my teenage years without even realizing what it was. i *constantly* switched between people back and forth, some lasted for years while others were months or weeks, and then i would turn my back on them completely and forget they existed.
  
  i take a mood stabilizer to supplement my anti-depressant, among other pills, and it's actually helped somewhat with respect to my severe mood swings, at the very least. i'm still very much attached easily, paranoid, and i dissociate occasionally still though. :/

  but it isn't something i would ever bring up, because well BPD and i know i'm acting a bit ridiculous. i'm so attached to her and i get so excited whenever she messages me first, and hanging out with her is so much fun and i'm so happy and content when we do chill. but at the same time, i get so resentful whenever she doesn't pay me any attention or turns down my plans and i know that's really toxic of me to do that.

  --
  
  yes, your feelings are *completely* valid !! and tbh, if i was in your shoes, i would feel the exact same way. it appears to have sprung up out of nowhere with no warning whatsoever, and maybe it's just my paranoia talking, but perhaps he had an ulterior motive in disconnecting from you (like if he met someone else?).
  
  i understand the BPD aspect all too well, especially considering i switch between ""favorite people"" far too often for my own good. i become obsessive and attached far too easily, and then i end up becoming hurt as a result because obviously they don't reciprocate those same feelings.
  
  all in all, your feelings are totally valid and i understand why you're hurting. i also understand his reasoning, but he did go about this the wrong way and he should have been a tad bit more considerate of your feelings.

  i just believe that our souls exist and inhabit our bodies, and when our bodies pass on, our souls are merely transferred to another being (not really an afterlife). our souls are energy, and energy cannot be destroyed.

  quit vaping -- that would be the most realistic scenario that might improve my life. i smoked cigarettes for 11 years, and when i quit i started vaping instead. however, i also know that vaping isn't the healthiest alternative and it would be beneficial to my health if i quit that too.
  
  there's nothing stopping me really besides my own free will. i don't want to quit just yet.

  i would probably be hurt by their words, especially if it's someone who claims they love me (whether it's family, friends, or a partner). i would second guess their feelings towards me because if they really did care about me, they wouldn't put me in a position to hurt me.
  "
400851,"
   What does the word “Morals” mean to you?
  ","
  morality is having a sense of right versus wrong, so when i think about morals, i think about criminal justice and the psychology behind why people do certain things (as well as their rationale behind it).
  
  i've honestly always considered myself to have a skewed sense of morality, tbh.

   Are you sensitive to what your loved say about you? Can you accept criticism?

  i'm fine with criticism, yeah. it's difficult to be upset over criticism when you've studied what i have studied, haha. i've taken courses and workshops where people have criticized my writing, which is something i'm most passionate about, and eventually you learn to either take the advice and apply it or disregard what anyone has to say.

400872,"
   What should never compromise in a relationship (your happiness or your time)?
  ","
  ideally, you should not compromise either your happiness and your time in relationships. however, i do believe happiness matters most -- and if you're in a relationship where your happiness is not being given a priority by your partner, then that's a sign that perhaps you two aren't doing well together.

  "
400875,"
   Who’s a better writer you or you’re boyfriend?

  when it comes to writing, i'm better at poetry & prose than he is. mainly because i've been writing since i was a child, took multiple courses in creative writing and grammar, and i practice every day at my job.
  
  he's also pretty good at writing creatively, but he seldom does it because he isn't so much interested in writing in general.

  i'm most proud of this photo that i took a few years ago on a minolta film camera. i wish i still had that camera -- i prefer film over digital photographs.
  "
400877,"
   Is it fair that the FBI can set people up to commit crimes then arrest them ?

  perhaps i'm ignorant, but i've never heard this theory before. if the people still have the free will to commit crimes even though they've been set up, then i do believe that it's fair for them to be arrested afterwards.

  "
400883,"
   Are you a better talker or listener?

  i'm a much better listener than i am a talker. i find it hard to express myself verbally when speaking, and i like listening to other people tell me their stories and concerns because i want to offer insight and help them.
  "
400884,"
   Have you ever read any books about self development?

  sorta? i've read ""be here now"" by ram dass, but it was a very long time ago. it was very enlightening to me at the time, especially considering how spiritual i used to be.
  "
400885,"
   Do you think that people who are emotionally detached are better at their work?
  ","
  i don't really think there's a correlation between the two. those who are good at their job (or whatever they do for work) are that way because of a hard work ethic and ability to focus. it wouldn't necessarily matter if someone is emotionally detached or emotionally invested in their work unless their emotions are deterring them from actually getting the job done.
  "

   Do you have wind chimes in your house?
  ","
  no, we don't have wind chimes.
  "
400887,"
   What came first, chicken or egg??‍♂️
  ","
  i believe the egg came first, because chickens are not the only animals that lay eggs. there has been proof that some animals, long ago, laid eggs that hatched to young and i believe that as time passed on and evolution began happening, it transcended to such animals as chickens.
  "
400888,"
   Earth, Water, Air, Fire. Which element would you rather bend? Why? ? (Just pick one ?)
  ","
  i would rather bend water. as a water sign (scorpio), i've always felt very comfortable around the water, and i've also always been very fluid and wavering, particularly in my likes and dislikes. as for the physical component of water, it would be interesting to affect the tides.
  "
400889,"
   That feeling of kiss i wants to know from somebody. i try questioning to you. but you took it to your heart

  the fact that you're taking this so personally and won't let it go means that *you're* the one taking it to heart, lmaoo.

   some girls do friendzone guys tho... i mean the ones who take the guys feelings to their advantage and string em along to make em think they have a chance when they never will... those are evil
  ","
  that isn't being in the friend zone. that's just a woman taking advantage of someone else's feelings to suit their own desires. it definitely isn't ""evil,"" but it's wrong and manipulative.
  "
400894,"
   If all humans want the same basic things, why is there so much violence and strife between people?
  ","
  i don't believe that all humans want to same things in life, besides the basics like food and shelter. there are some people who are controlled by greed, and their desires are much different than the desires of others. these people are also mostly people in positions of power, like governmental positions, so the reason why there is so much violence and strife is because they have the means to be so.
  
  as for the common man, some people are simply grown into violence and their desires are less pure because they want to hurt people.
  "
400895,"
   So do you remember your first adult kiss? how was it feel?
  ","
  i mean, if you're asking from the time i turned 18 years old, then it's something i don't quite remember either because i had been dating my boyfriend for a year at that point, and it definitely wasn't our first kiss together, lol.

400896,"
   What!!! you don't remember anything? nothing?

  i have memory loss, so i cannot remember anything prior to the age of 11 or so. the rest of the years (pre-teen years and teenagehood) are vague to me as well.
  "
400897,"
   How should we measure our lives? In years? In moments? In accomplishments? Something else?
  ","
  i believe we should measure the value of our lives in the experiences we gain along the way, as well as our accomplishments -- and sometimes even our failures, because failure teaches us to be better and do better.
  
  years come and go, but what truly matters is what we've learned through the unique experiences we come across, as well as our various accomplishments we succeed at along the way.
  "
400898,"
   how was your first kiss feeling?

  i honestly don't remember. my first kiss was when i was like ... 12 years old, i believe.
  "
400899,"
   Who here has been through the friendzone? ? Or are you usually the one who friendzones? Both? ?✨
  ","
  i don't believe in the concept of the ""friend zone,"" it's mainly used by entitled men who cannot take the word ""no"" for an answer when they're rejected by women. if someone refuses your advances, then you have to accept it for what it is, and if someone wants to remain friends, then they're not ""friend zoning"" you, they're simply being honest with their feelings.

   The year 2019 has coming to the end and are you fully satisfied with all those days in your life?
  ","
  i'm satisfied somewhat, but not satisfied in other aspects. much like any other year, there have been both ups and downs and what i've learned is that i have to ""roll with the punches,"" as they say, because there is no use in regretting the past especially when there's nothing i can do to change what has happened.
  "
400906,"
   In our digital world, most people receive satisfaction out of the followers and likes they receive on social media. are you one of these people? if so, what does it do for you personally? if you don't pay any mind to followers or likes, then what is the most important part of social media for you?
  ","
  i do have to admit, i am one of those people. i like seeing my follower count increase because i have a weird obsession with numbers, and it does only help to show me that people are interested in what i have to say -- especially considering how much i talk about and raise awareness for mental health.
  
  i don't care so much about likes, except for when it comes to my writing (for example) that i've posted on instagram. i haven't posted anything since early december, sadly, but it did mean a lot to me when people did like my poetry and prose on there.

Whether it’s being promoted or moving out of your parents’ house, I have seen all your progress. It makes me very happy to see you being so resilient and strong despite still having bad days. I am sure in the future or near future, you would continue to make progress in terms of work or healing. I appreciate that you are still here in this present moment.

   How do small businesses advocate for a better understanding of mental illness?
  ","
  there are some small businesses whose sole mission is to raise awareness of mental illness through the products they sell. for example, i'm a big fan of the business schizophrenic.NYC -- it's based out of new york city, and they sell various prints and pins and shirts and whatnot with various sayings related to schizophrenia and the stigma associated with it.
  
  they recently got big because of their new shirt that says ""i'm mentally ill and i don't k*ll"" based on recent events where the media has been blaming mental illness for tragedies, like shootings and stuff.

  perhaps it was because i was a bit too young to watch the movie, but ""the grudge"" scared the crap out of me when i was a teenager/pre-teen. it haunted me for weeks afterwards.
  
  my favorite scary movies are the ""saw"" movies, if those are considered to be scary. i think of them more as psychological thrillers, but there are some scary components to them. i also like ""the hills have eyes,"" ""hostel,"" ""house of wax,"" ""high tension,"" and ""the texas chainsaw massacre.""

  yes, i 100% agree with this. i had one relationship when i was a teenager which was totally toxic (he was 18-19 years old and i was only 13-14 years old, so that gives you an idea). social media wasn't prevalent at the time, but we did a lot of ""public displays of affection"" at school to show our alleged love for each other. i was smitten with him despite his toxic traits, and also because i was totally naive, but eventually i did realize how bad he was for me and i was the one who broke up with him after about six months.

  in my own personal opinion, it's having trust in and communication with your partner. you always need to have open communication in your relationship because otherwise things will not progress or improve. obviously in some cases it's hard to be honest, but it's also for the best because you need a foundation of trust in order for the relationship to be successful.

  in fact, it's quite the opposite. loving someone, and being in love with someone, may be easy and come naturally. but there is still hard work you have to put into maintaining the relationship while also keeping your own sense of identity intact. there will no doubt be disagreements, and it's important to have communication and trust in your relationship with who you love. love itself is the easy part -- the hard part is furthering that love with someone else, being on the same page, and working toward the same goals.

  however, i did this for quite a few semesters in order to afford my bills, gas, food, school books, etc etc. it was a stable source of income and made me much more comfortable, and i did it out of a need to, not necessarily because i wanted to, which was more of a motivation to keep moving forward.

401004,"
   You can reply here.
  ","
  first of all -- i understand completely where you're coming from regarding your efforts at being close to your mother and what you've gone through in order to be validated by her. i've experienced that myself, and often through the same methods because my mother is exactly the same way.
  
  i also understand being freaked out and feeling like you betrayed your friend, as well, especially with respect to BPD. BPD makes our emotions so much more intense than they rationally should be, and i do have to say that your reaction to telling your mother about your friend is a bit irrational !! but that's perfectly okay, because awareness is the most important part.
  
  i think it would be appropriate to tell your friend what you told your mother, although honestly i don't think your friend would think it's a big deal *at all* because it is the truth and you also didn't go into detail regarding it at all. it isn't so much gossip as it is updating your mother on the situation on a very vague, surface level. your friend is most likely going to tell you that it's perfectly fine and you have nothing to worry about.
  
  it's also appropriate to tell your therapist, since i'm sure they'll reiterate the same things i'm telling you now. it's a good source of validation that you did not do the wrong thing, because i genuinely believe your actions are justified and you did absolutely nothing wrong.
  
  i hope this helped !!

   A space for your thoughts  ●●●
  ","
  my boyfriend and i are pitching in to buy my roommate a new xbox one for christmas, since he couldn't take his old xbox with him when he moved out of his ex's house a few months ago. he's been wanting to play games so badly, but has only been relying on his xbox 360 and the few games he has on there at this point.
  
  i'm picking the console up today at gamestop, and i'm going to wrap it while my roommate brings his father to their airport this afternoon. :3
  "
401006,"
   What would be on the gag reel of your life?
  ","
  definitely all of the times i've said awkward things without meaning to, messing up words and combining them when talking too fast, or trying to explain something but using less than conventional phrasing. lmaoo.
  
  for example, i was talking to my coworkers a few weeks ago about how my roommate and i made a lot of spaghetti and meatballs for dinner the previous night. for some reason, i couldn't think of a better say to explain how much we made, so i ended up blurting out, ""there were so many spaghettis!"" lmaoo.
  "
401007,"
   When I was in school they didn't give ""F""s they gave ""E""s instead did you get graded on an ABCDF or ABCDE or some other grading scale?
  ","
  depending on the class, we either got graded A-F marks or through percentage marks that equated to the different letters.
  "
401008,"
   Are you a good liar??
  ","
  yes, i'm actually a good liar. almost too good of a liar, as i've managed to get myself out of situations by simply lying about what i'm doing or who i'm with.
  "
401009,"
   Apologies if you've received this before! But what was your favourite gift you received this holiday? :3
  ","
  definitely the skyrim box set of books my brother bought me. :')) i can't wait to start reading about the history and lore behind skyrim.
  "
401010,"
   What are you doing?
  ","
  well, when you sent this question, i was sleeping.
  
  but now, i'm going through social media and drinking coffee.
  "
401011,"
   What is your absolute favorite part of the morning?
  ","
  sitting down at my laptop to browse the internet, having three cups of coffee, listening to ambient music, and lighting a scented candle. :'))
  "
401012,"
   I see. Is it okay to seek your advice/insight on a mistake I made that is bothering me? Since you have BPD too I think you would be able to relate or understand it more? It might be a little long though.
  ","
  yeah, but i probably won't answer until tomorrow because i'm going to bed now.
  "
401013,"
   Would you mind giving examples? How do they feel about this? Do they feel manipulated?
  ","
  like, i'll text a certain friend multiple times in order to get a response or tell them that i'm feeling a certain way to elicit the response i want from them. i'll try to gear conversations towards my own feelings and events instead of focusing on their own feelings to get validation or sympathy.
  
  i don't know if they feel manipulated or not because they've never brought it up before, so idk.
  "
401014,"
   Do you find yourself doing things that made you untrustworthy when you were still not working on your BPD?Iike lying or accidentally saying something to someone you don’t mean to say etc?I don’t know I have BPD and working on it now but when I look back I did a lot of those things and I’m so ashamed
  ","
  yeah, i still find myself to be very manipulative towards people i think i trust in order to get their affection -- even when i wasn't treated for BPD, i acted this way and i still continue to act this way even after being treated. i assume it's just a part of who i am at this point.
  "
401015,"
   Do you have special socks you get excited to wear when it's winter time and especially cold out? I'm wearing fuzzy slipper socks.

  i have knee high socks that i like wearing under pajama pants when it's cold outside.

   If you could undo one thing in your life, what would it be?
  ","
  uh, probably the ab*se i went through. that would be quite lovely.
  "
401018,"

  ","
  i don't use gloves in general.
  "
401019,"
   Which is the highest speed you have done with your car?
  ","
  idk, probably around 75-80 mph?
  
  with my old car, it was definitely 90-100 mph when i was speeding down the highway to take my friend to the hospital, lol.
  "
401020,"
   Which animal is cutest as a baby?
  ","
  i think most baby animals are cute.
  "
401021,"
   How'd you describe the way you like to decorate the rooms you live in? What kind of aesthetic do you like? ?
  ","
  idk if i have any sort of aesthetic, but i do like rustic-looking rooms -- hardwood floors, dark wooden desks and tables, neutral toned furniture, rugs and tapestries, etc etc.
  
  my currently bedroom has tapestries hanging on the walls, as well as string lights. i have espresso colored desks and tables and bookshelves, dark brown carpet, and a few posters/flyers on the wall.

  i want to be a reinvented version of me -- someone who's myself, but amplified. someone who isn't afraid to take risks of chances, someone who isn't afraid to state what they're feeling, someone who will bypass all of their anxiety and woes to become what they were truly meant to be all along.
  "
401025,"
   Really? You are brave. I am a little scared myself. Did your former stylist go straight with the shaver? Or she first cropped all the long bits with scissors before shaving it all? In any case i like your bravery :)
  ","
  she cut it short first, i believe, before taking the shaver to it. i don't really remember. i've had my head shaved for like two years now.

  yes, i heard it might be a bad winter. :/

   I want to shave my head in a way similar to yours. But i am quite nervous about it. Do you have any tips on a first time head shave?
  ","
  i mean, i shaved my head on an impulse. lmaoo. i didn't go in with the intention of shaving my head, but i told my former stylist to just do it, so that's how it happened.

  ","
  i answered this question a few hours ago.

  "
401031,"
   How was your day
  ","
  my day has been emotional, but all right. i've been worried sick about my boyfriend's dog, but now i'm just trying to distract myself by watching season two of ""you"" on netflix.

  ","
  my friends and family, lmaoo. i *love* coffee and tea.

  the two most significant pieces i got for christmas were a box set of skyrim books from my brother, and my mother got me a framed watercolor print of chester bennington singing, which i'm hanging up in my room soon. other than that, i got some candles, lotions, coffee syrups, and tea.

  your guess is as good as mine, lmaoo.
  "
401040,"
   Why did you need an xray?

  i believe i broke my hand or my wrist? i honestly don't remember. i just remember being in the room with the machine and there was something covering the rest of my body, and my arm was on the platform.

  no, i've had x-rays taken but never a CT scan or an MRI.
  "

  no, i don't shower every day to begin with -- i shower every two days, and i wash my hair once to twice per week.
  "
401043,"
   What was the last big mistake you made?
  ","
  can everyone please send good wishes/vibes or prayers if you believe in that for my boyfriend's dog -- he's at the vet right now, and they found a growth in his throat which may or may not be cancerous. they have to put him under and place a camera in his throat to check it out, and if it isn't cancerous they can just discharge him with antibiotics.
  
  i'm praying that's the case, because i'm already an emotional wreck and to lose another dog would be devastating. please send me good wishes and keep him in your thoughts.
  "
401044,"
   ""The best cure for a hangover is another drink."" Agree or disagree?
  ","
  i mean, they always say ""hair of the dog,"" which basically means the best cure for a hangover is to have more alcohol, lmaoo.
  
  i always eat an egg sandwich, drink a lot of water or gatorade, and take a nap and that usually does the trick.
  "
401045,"
   Do you keep your closet door open or closed at night?

  i keep my closet door closed all the time, for the sake of my bedroom looking neat and tidy.

   What's your ideal partner? Do the ones you date/marry usually meet them or do your ideals change along the way? ☺
  ","
  my ideal partner is my current partner. i value honesty, communication, thoughtfulness, and definitely a sense of humor. i wouldn't be able to date someone who doesn't see the amusing side of things or make jokes, i need that aspect of my life in order to really get through things.
  
  luckily my partner encompasses all of that. he's very honest and open with his concerns and thoughts, and he puts a lot of thought into the things he does. he's incredibly passionate about what he's interested in and he makes me laugh every day.

  ","
  hey friends, my inbox is totally empty. ask me some questions ~~
  "
401053,"
   How do you know when you’ve met the right person for you? (Can be platonically or romantically).
  ","
  regardless of whether the relationship is platonic or romantic, i believe you've met a right person for you when your chemistry is undeniable and you can have conversations for hours without getting tired of each other. you share similar interests and get excited when you talk to each other, there's never a dull moment between you two, and even if you have disagreements you move past them because you understand your relationship is more important than the small dilemma you're facing.
  "
401054,"
   Have you ever gotten on social media, seen everyone else's profile and started to feel bad because you started comparing your life to theirs?
  ","
  yes, it's happened to me on numerous occasions. :/ especially around the holidays.
  
  everyone during the holiday season posts about their relationships with their families, posting pictures and videos and whatnot, and sometimes it makes me feel bad because i don't have -- and never will have -- that same sort of relationship with my own family. i also understand, however, that things may be different behind closed doors, but the thought still remains.
  "
401055,"
   Is there such thing as your real self or does your self change as time passes and given the circumstances you are in?
  ","
  i'm sure there's a ""real self"" for other people, but personally speaking, i have zero sense of self of identity in light of my borderline personality disorder. i grew up in survival mode and i never was given the chance to explore and find my sense of identity growing up, so as an adult, it has resulted in me switching between different personality traits on a whim depending upon who i'm with.
  "
401056,"
   So okay where else you can talk and know them to give it? Expect here the ask
  ","
  all of my other social media profiles are private. if you want to ask me questions, you can do so on askfm.
  "
401057,"
   Snapchat?
  ","
  i don't give out my snapchat to people unless i've talked with them for a long time and trust them.
  "
401058,"
   What’s the difference between being rude and being honest?
  ","
  being rude is honesty with the result of hurting someone, whether intentional or not (although mostly intentional). being honest takes other people's feelings into consideration.
  "
401059,"
   Do you know any self righteous people?
  ","
  oh yes, definitely. i try to limit contact with those people at all costs. i come across a lot of these types of people on askfm, for example.
  "
401060,"
   What secrets do you have that you hide from the world?
  ","
  well, if it's a secret then i certainly wouldn't tell the internet for everyone to know.
  "
401061,"
   If someone were going to knit something for you, what item would you want knitted?
  ","
  a beanie !! i love wearing beanies in the winter.
  "
401062,"
   Has having an askfm taught you anything about yourself?
  ","
  askfm has taught me that i have the ability to be very patient in the face of ignorance or controversy, and that i'm more willing to take the time to teach others their wrongdoings or problematic lines of thinking instead of getting emotional towards them.
  "
401063,"

  oh man, i would never be able to narrow it down to just one song. however, my favorite artists of the decade are definitely grandson, two feet, watsky, and starset.
  "
401065,"
   gender is not necessary tho, we can just discard it
  ","
  i disagree. gender is very necessary and is a part of a person's identity. to discard gender means to invalidate and discard the identities of trans people.
  "
401066,"
   are you a hypocritical person?if so, how far can you go?
  ","
  i don't believe i'm a hypocritical person, no. i probably was to some degree in the past when i was younger and more naive, though.

"
401068,"
   should we get rid if gender and just be known by our sex?

  relaxing music and a scented candle lit in the distance.
  "
401070,"
   When people call themselves dogmom are they comparing adopted pets to adopted children?
  ","
  when women refer to themselves as ""dog moms,"" they're just stating that they're the parent of a dog, lol. it doesn't take away from people who have mothered or fathered children.
  "
401071,"
   How was your Christmas?
  ","
  my christmas was all right. christmas eve was entertaining, to put it lightly, and i'm glad that there were other people around to take the spotlight off of me. but tonight (christmas day) was difficult. and looking at everyone else having great times with their families and taking photos kinda makes me feel terrible about my relationship with my own family. i've never had that and i probably never will. i wish i had a family to call my own.

   What are the things you want to avoid in a relationship?
  ","
  ask me questions ~~
  "
401074,"
   what’s a promise you’ve recently made to yourself?
  ","
  not to compromise myself for the sake of any friendship or relationship, the fact that someone would place me in a position to be hurt is proof that they don't care about me as much as they say they do.
  "
401075,"
   What’s something currently hidden from you that you would like to be revealed?
  ","
  the insides of this can of alcohol, which i will soon be discovering...
  "
401076,"
   How far you would go for a loved one? Do you have limits?
  ","
  i would walk to the end of the earth & back for my close friends and boyfriend. i don't have many limits at all, mainly due to my questionable morals, and if there was something drastic i had to do to save their life or something similar, then i wouldn't think twice about it.
  "
401077,"

  "
401078,"
   Do you make merry at Christmas or do you see it as a poor excuse to pick a man's pocket every December 25th?
  ","
  i can see both sides, tbh. christmas is a time to spend with family and friends, but it's also been *so* commercialized to the point where people are breaking the bank to spend money on gifts for their loved ones. there's too much emphasis on gift giving these days.

401090,"
   What's so wrong in patronizing?

  he doesn't honestly like mechanical engineering, lol. he's more interested in the application of engineering, i.e. being the one actually building things, as opposed to simply designing them. he has good experience now in how designs are made and can pinpoint exactly when certain blueprints aren't going to work before they're even implemented.

  i'm doing well !! i woke up a little while ago & made breakfast with my roommates and unwrapped some gifts with them. i'm just relaxing in the meantime and then i'm seeing my boyfriend and his family later.

   being a teenager is no excuse. i never did drugs so maybe i missed out huh lmao
  ","

  obviously it's everyone's own personal choice. i only ever did hard drugs once or twice, the rest was simply marijuana which isn't exactly a big deal.

   What are some things you would consider part of your aesthetic?
  ","
  i've never been able to ascribe to any sort of aesthetic. my ""aesthetic"" changes day by day, and i suppose it's because i have a personality disorder but i've never been able to pinpoint a particular vibe and relate to it with my entire being for more than a few days at a time.

  i'm a bit anxious, but overall fine. although christmas eve with my family went well, it always makes me feel on edge because i never know where the conversation is going to turn. but now that i'm home safe, i feel much better.

  my day went surprisingly well, actually. i only worked until 4:00pm and then i spent some time at my parents' house since we always spend christmas eve together. we exchanged gifts with my aunt and cousin, and i legit just got home and it's past midnight. whew.

  i'm not exactly sure what you're getting at, but the reason why i was finally able to move out was because i got a raise in august.

  my laptop is always home.

401142,"
   if you made good life decisions you wouldn't be this poor
  ","
  ???
  
  yes, because all people who have little money are solely responsible for being placed in that situation, despite the fact that our society contributes little to people who are poor and instead reward those who are already rich.
  
  i've made excellent decisions in my life. unfortunately, life itself is unfair.
  "
401143,"
   Do you all eat the same amount though? This isn’t fair
  ","
  it seems fair to me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  
  if someone needs something extra, they'll go to the store and pick it up with their own money.
  "
401144,"
   Is it more fair this way? Y'all grown adults why don't each one take responsibility for his own expenses?
  ","
  we all basically share the same food, so it wouldn't matter either way. we eat dinner together, use the same lunch meats, etc etc.
  "
401145,"
   What would you think if you found out your boyfriend was hiding a phone from you?

  i would think that he was keeping secrets from me, and then i would have a serious talk about trust and communication with him.

   How much do you spend on food monthly?
  ","
  around $400-500 for the entire household, obviously split among all of us.

   Then stop acting like you’re poor. You could find another job on this week you know

  i never said i was poor -- i live paycheck to paycheck, much like most other people in the working class.

  i do have a savings account for emergencies, lol.
  "
401149,"
   This isn’t hard to grasp, if you don’t work then you don’t get paid. Stop being a lil brat. You feminists always like to complain
  ","
  considering we literally do not have the option to work during this week, it would be expected to be paid during the holiday as people won't have any other source of income.
  
  any respectable organization or company normally pays our their employees for time not used, either. it's only fair.
  "
401150,"
   I really hate that policy. If you don't use it I really do wish they'd just pay you out the unused time as some sort of ""you work more often since you didn't take your sick/vacation so here it is as a bonus!"" Like, I do just genuinely enjoy being at work and don't wanna be made to take time. ;-;
  ","
  i've used up most of my PTO anyway for various reasons so unfortunately it didn't affect me like that. i just wish i got paid for holiday break, lol.

   Merry Christmas everyone xx
  ","
  merry christmas to you too !! ❄️
  "
401153,"
   I wonder if it has anything to do with wanting people to use time that doesn't roll over? I was heavily encouraged to use the rest of my sick time for the same reason. My company didn't keep me in the loop very well about the time I had remaining and reminded me it doesn't roll over :(
  ","
  possibly. we can only roll over 3 vacation days, the rest we lose if we have leftover time.
  "
401154,"
   That's truly f'd up of them. I don't know what your company is like the rest of the year but damn!
  ","
  even though it's a publishing company, we make money off of sales so we're open every day except thanksgiving, christmas, and new years (which are paid days). this is the first year they gave us this week off, but i still think it's bull.
  "
401155,"
   WHAT???? Then they didn't give you anything, they're just making you use time! Dude... :( What about people who may have used their time off through the year? Are they just getting an unpaid vacation? Because in that event I'd way rather just work.
  ","
  I saw your second message. but yeah, it's ridiculous. it isn't enough that i spent money on christmas gifts but now i'll be short even more money come january. :/
  "
401156,"
   Are there any movies that you find hard to watch due to emotional power, but you enjoy watching anyway?
  ","
  i actually started watching the netflix docu-series ""don't f**k with cats"" and i find it to be emotionally overwhelming due to the subject matter, but it's intriguing nonetheless. i watched the first part last night & i'll be finishing it over the next few days.
  "
401157,"
   If the Purge was real what would you do on Purge night?
  ","
  probably steal from local stories and rob banks for money and whatnot.
  "
401158,"
   Use this question as a rant space, or a rave space!
  ","
  i'm glad that my job gave us the week off between christmas day & new years day, but i think it's dumb how we're forced to use our vacation time and PTO to make up for the days, especially considering the office is closed and no one can work.
  
  for those who don't have enough time, like myself, we have to take the days unpaid. :/ i'm only getting paid for like 1.5 of the four days.
  "
401159,"
   what mythical creature do you wish actually existed?
  ","
  dragons. i've always been enthralled by the idea of them.
  "
401160,"
   soundcloud or vinyls?
  ","
  i've never listened to soundcloud before, lol. i prefer vinyls. my old college roommate has a record player in our dorm room & it was excellent.
  "
401161,"
   Which is worse in your opinion - silence or loneliness? I wish you a wonderful, family and peaceful Christmas ???
  ","
  loneliness is definitely worse. i enjoy the silence and prefer quiet days over loud days. however, loneliness in itself can often be deafening.
  "
401162,"
   Marry Christmas to you ???
  ","
  a very merry christmas to you too !!
  "
401163,"
   How do you spend the majority of your free time?

401165,"
   What is your opinion on the conspiracy theory that modern technology comes from Aliens?
  ","
  i love that conspiracy theory, and i routinely watch the show ""ancient aliens,"" lmaoo. i find the concept to be so intriguing and, at times, believable.
  "
401166,"
   In what ways has a friend betrayed you?
  ","
  i've had ex-friends talk sh*t about me behind my back and then play nice to my face, as if i wasn't going to find out that they're two-faced. i dropped them immediately.
  "
401167,"
   What are you determined to achieve in 2020?
  ","
  i don't have any set plans or goals, but i just want to live my life to the best of my ability and take on any opportunity that comes my way. i don't want to be too afraid to say no to things that present themselves, and i want to focus more on my creativity.
  "
401168,"

  ","
  i want an ice cold beer. luckily, i'm about to grab one from the fridge.

   What's something you NEED right now?
  ","
  i really need to take a shower, but i'm exhausted and unmotivated. i just spent the evening wrapping gifts.
  "
401170,"
   Why do they freak you out?
  ","
  idk, they just send me into panic mode. loud noises in general trigger me.
  "
401171,"
   What makes a relationship work besides love?
  ","
  trust, communication, and the ability to understand and realize when you're wrong & apologize accordingly. not having an arrogant sense of pride to the point where it prevents you from talking to your partner with honesty and vulnerability.
  "
401172,"
   Do you usually celebrate NYE?
  ","
  not usually, no. the fireworks freak me out.
  "
401173,"

401177,"
   Have you or your pet ever knocked over the Christmas tree?
  ","
  yes, lmaoo. my previous dog knocked the entire 8-foot tree over completely during our first christmas together. she was so scared, i felt so bad.

  yes, i'm tired like ... 90% of the day.

  well, that is the purpose of askfm.
  "
401185,"
   can you all notice how toxic cadie is, she literally talks shxt about people left and right, even those she considered as friends. never trust her with your secrets.
  ","
  i fail to see why this was sent to me. y'all are obsessed with drama and it's pathetic. if you truly cared then you would message someone off anon, privately, to come to a resolution -- instead of sending mass messages to others talking your own sh*t about people.
  "
401186,"
   do you agree with cadie?
  ","
  i don't even know what she said, lmaoo.

401188,"
   Is education free at universities in your country? For example in my country you need to pay for all years.
  ","
  no, education at universities is unbearably expensive in the united states. people usually take out student loans and pay them off for years upon years. i graduated in 2013 and i'll probably be paying off my loans monthly for the next 6+ years.

   Do you not get on with your family?

  i've never heard of a daemon before, but i just quickly looked up what they are and i'm so intrigued by it !!
  
  i believe my daemon would be a wolf. i've always been interested in wolves, their behavior, and just the majestic and fascinating stories behind them. growing up, my favorite books were ""call of the wild"" and ""white fang,"" and wolves have always been with me throughout my life. it's the reason why i have so many wolf memorabilia and a wolf tattoo.

   What's the most thrilling thing you've gotten to do? ? When and where did you do it? How was it? ?

   How do you define freedom?
  ","
  freedom is a feeling of being completely unrestrained, liberated, and having the ability to do what you want to do without much push back or reins at all. you are your own individual and have the freedom to make conscious decisions according to your own will, not the will or expectations of anyone else.
  "

  yes, there are some moments in peoples' lives where they are desperate for money for various reasons, whether it's to afford food or shelter or bills.
  "
401224,"
   If you were extremely wealthy, how would you help your community? Or would you not?
  ","
  i would donate to local charities, as well as national charities. i would help out small business owners as well, especially my friends who run etsy shops and whatnot.
  "
401225,"
   Say something people wouldn’t expect from you:
  ","
  i'm actually pretty motivated by money, and i'll go out of my way in certain situations if there's monetary gain involved. i've made money through nefarious means in the past when i was desperate enough for it.
  "
401226,"
   When was the last time you got shy and in what situation? ?
  ","
  i'm not sure because i'm not exactly a shy person, i'm more socially anxious/awkward than anything else. once i'm comfortable with a person then i'm essentially an open book and quite obnoxious, lol.
  "
401227,"
   Which can you tolerate more: emotional or physical pain?
  ","
  emotional pain is more tolerable to me, i guess because in a way i've been conditioned to endure it after struggling with inner pain for so long. i've learned to accept and adapt over the years.
  
  physical pain, on the other hand, is sometimes unbearable to me. i basically live off of ibuprofen, lmaoo.

401228,"
   In what ways are you different from how you were 10 years ago at the end of the last decade?
  ","
  i'm a completely different person, tbh. 10 years ago, i was a senior in high school and was still heavily involved in serious mental illness, s*icidal ideation, and self-harm to addictive levels. i honestly couldn't see myself living past the age of 20.
  
  now, at 28 years old, i'm living independently, have an amazing job, and my mental health is worlds better and more stable than it's ever been in the past.

  success is being happy with the progression you're making toward your goals -- it isn't defined by milestones by any means, but rather the journey you're taking in order to reach your objectives. if you're happy with where you are, and have the necessities to have shelter, food, and running water, then i would consider that a success.

  i would probably make a mini apartment out of it, lmaoo. running electricity, a bathroom, a small kitchen with a stove/oven, and i would purchase a lot of canned goods because they're not perishable for a long time. i would also like some sort of skylight or ability to see the outside world and check up on how things are progressing to see whether or not it was safe to come out of hiding.

  "
401276,"
   What can I do ? I'm just going to do that useless thing.  I mean  , why are they doing exams?
  ","
  if you're asking why colleges and schools in general give final exams at the end of the semester, it's simply a way of quizzing your knowledge of what you've learned the entire semester in order to give you the final grade.
  
  i never really liked big exams like that because i found them to be intimidating, but it's simply the way it is and it's always been the case. i would prefer courses to test you periodically throughout the semester and add up that cumulative grade instead of having, for example, one mid-term and one final exam.

  my favorite mug is my ""mental health advocate"" white mug. it holds 16oz of coffee and is white, and for some reason i love white mugs because it's such a stark contrast to the coffee or tea that's inside.

  trump has already been impeached by the house of representatives. however, that doesn't mean he's been removed from office -- there still needs to be a trial through the senate for them to determine whether or not he'll be removed.

  it would depend on a lot of circumstances, i.e. whether or not i thought their partner was a good person, how long they've been dating, their chemistry together, etc etc. if i genuinely liked their partner and thought they would be an excellent parent, then i would consider allowing them to move in until my child and their partner could find their own place to live.

  ","
  i don't remember my political beliefs before i started perusing the internet as an adult, but i'm sure my beliefs now are much different than how they used to be. that's something natural that happens as people grow older and discover new things about themselves, about society, about education in general, etc etc.

   What’s your opinion on the “ cancel culture”?
  ","
  i think the current ""cancel culture"" is pretty problematic, especially with respect to resurfacing past discrepancies from years ago. people grow and change as they get older, and just because someone was problematic in the past doesn't necessarily mean they are now -- but still, people ""cancel"" them even if they *have* grown and changed, and i don't think it's fair. we're all problematic to some degree, anyhow.
  
  but if someone is currently being problematic, whether it's through racism or sexism or homophobia/transphobia or ableism, then yeah -- ""cancelling"" someone is totally valid. especially if they haven't learned of their mistakes, accepted they made a mistake, apologized, and tried to do better.

  i've experienced a lot of heartbreak/heartache throughout my lifetime, mainly because i feel things so strongly most of the time and so any minor hit impacts me significantly. it has normally occurred in a relationship context, but i've also been heartbroken over lost friendships as well.
  
  honestly, i haven't learned much from them besides that maybe i'm a much stronger person than i've believed myself to be. regardless of what i've endured, i've always bounced back with extra motivation and have worked towards my goals in spite of my pain.

  "
401491,"
   Well I was specifically talking about not allowing them to cheat on you. Not other stuff. I thought that was a given in the vast majority of cases. And yes they do exist like a lot of other things in life but it's still degenerative and that's just my thoughts.
  ","
  ah, okay -- i thought you meant ""allowing"" or ""not allowing"" your partner to do stuff in a general sense, which is obviously controlling behavior. in monogamous relationships, then yes -- sleeping with someone who isn't your partner can be construed as cheating.
  
  i don't personally think there's anything wrong with polyamory, but it is what it is. obviously we have no common ground here.

  ","
  i feel limited at times, as if i'm being held back from doing what it is i need to do to be a successful partner, and that's largely due to my mental health issues. i've always sought to be a better person than i have been previously, but i know that sometimes i'm misguided and can fall short.
  
  i do genuinely believe he can find someone better than me, lmaoo. that comes from my own insecurities about myself, though.
  "
401494,"
   You're reaching. Monogamy isn't ab.usive?? Not allowing your partner to date and screw other people isn't ab.usive?? Lmao. If they're consenting fine but I still think there's no point in even being in a relationship at that point. And we'll just have to agree to disagree about men's behavior.
  ","
  ???
  
  when did i say that monogamy was ab*sive ... ? i'm in a monogamous relationship myself, lol. if you're in a monogamous relationship, or a polyamorous relationship, then consent is crucial to pretty much anything. but the idea of ""not allowing"" your partner to do certain things in their life is controlling (i wasn't talking about going out and having s*x with others). your partner isn't your property and you don't hold the reigns to their life.
  
  we will have to agree to disagree, but please bare in mind that polyamorous relationships have always existed and will continue to exist, and as long as the people involved in those relationships are happy and consenting, then it shouldn't be anyone else's concern.
  "
401495,"
   being jealous doesn’t make you a toxic person. jealously is a very normal emotion, just like sadness or happiness.
  ","
  i agree. that's why i said most forms of jealousy are toxic, not that it makes a person toxic. i experience jealousy in a lot of different ranges of my life, and yes -- it's very unhealthy for me, but it doesn't make me a toxic person.

  "
401498,"
   Are you a great gf for your bf?
  ","
  well, if i'm not a great partner then he certainly hasn't informed me, lmaoo. i'd like to think that i'm a good partner to my boyfriend, but i'm also hyper-critical of myself and believe that i can always do more, be more.
  "
401499,"

   Can jealously lead to divorce? When it is healthy and when it isn’t?
  ","
  i think most forms of jealousy is toxic, and it can definitely lead to problems in marriage that might end up in divorce. if you're insecure with your relationship or not trusting of your spouse to the point where you're jealous of other people in their lives, then that's very unhealthy.
  "
401501,"
   Do you believe all cheaters are evil? (Excluding abxsive relationships)
  ","
  no, people who cheat in relationships are not evil people. evil has a *very* negative connotation and is usually reserved for those who are senseless, remorseless k*llers and people in that regard. on the other hand, those who cheat on their partners aren't evil -- misguided and in the wrong, of course, but definitely not evil.

  yes, that is indeed the purpose of askfm. i've been using this website for going on 6-7 years, at this point. lol.
  "
401503,"
   In regards to mental health yes men should speak up because that's a life or death thing. if they're sick they can't help it. But stuff like letting your wife date other people and just being effeminate and OVERLY emotional is off putting for a man. Just my opinion.
  ","
  in a healthy relationship, you don't ""allow"" or ""not allow"" your partner to do things -- that's overly controlling and can be a red flag for ab*sive behavior. your partner should have the freedom to do what to do. in terms of polyamorous relationships, it isn't the idea of ""allowing"" someone to date another person. it's consensual activity and both parties are free to date whomever they choose. people aren't property.
  
  in addition, being effeminate and emotional does not make someone ""less of a man"" either. we're all human beings, we're all creatures of emotion, and we're all free to express ourselves in whichever way we choose. if the idea of a man being emotional is off-putting to you, then that's your prerogative in terms of dating. but you shouldn't judge other people for the way they behave or express themselves simply because it isn't your exact lifestyle.

401505,"
   It took me a year to finally speak about my mental issues to my bf, whenever he tried to talk to me I shut him off. We used to fight a lot. And now he’s blaming me for not saying anything to him this passed year. Am I in the wrong? Is it my fault?
  ","
  i don't really know how to answer this because you're giving me little information. however, i can say this -- relationships are built off of communication and trust, and there's no use in blaming someone for something that happened in the past that you cannot change in the now.
  
  the best thing to do, in any circumstance, is to sit down with your partner and have a serious discussion about your communication issues, and how to make them better. which includes your hesitance to talk about your mental health and everything in between.

   Letting your wife have a live in boyfriend is pathetic, I don't care lol. Toxic masculinity is a stupid libtard concept that hardly anyone takes seriously besides a small group of morons no one really likes, sorry.
  ","
  it's unfortunate that you believe in these things, because toxic masculinity is the source of high rates of mental illness in men -- mainly because it isn't seen as ""manly"" for men to discuss their feelings, which in turn leads to higher rates of male s*icide.
  
  you're correct in that no one takes it seriously, but it isn't something only ""moronic"" people care about. it's studied upon extensively by academic scholars and can be a great source of distress for several different types of men.
  "

   Breaks my heart to hear about that.  I hope you know you’re stronger than you might think you are.  The fact you’re able to openly speak about this is proof of that.  Don’t give up and always know there is always someone willing to listen if you should ever need advice or any sort of help.

  i heard the term in the past, but didn't feel the need to really look into it, so i'm mostly unfamiliar with the theory. however, i just read up briefly on it -- and it's definitely a *very* interesting theory that may be beneficial to those struggling with mental health issues if the theory is studied more extensively.
  
  on the one hand, i do believe that trauma cannot be passed down generation to generation solely due to genetic coding. i believe that the effects of trauma on adults can be passed onto their children due to child-rearing behaviors, and the ways that the parents consciously or unconsciously raise their children that could have a detrimental impact on their development. this is more of a first-hand trauma, not so much second-hand trauma.

  ","
  i struggle significantly with mental illness. it stems from a past of childhood ab*se, as well as genetic factors because mental illness runs in my family. it's influenced me negatively because i developed mood disorders and a personality disorder, which makes everyday tasks seem either insignificant or difficult. i have a hard time with anxiety, especially in the face of stressors that normally wouldn't be a big deal to most other people. i have sensory overload issues, and i can't be around too many people or too many sounds at once. i have really bad memory problems and amnesia, and i have a tendency toward substance ab*se.

  a perfect life, in my opinion, is a life that you're totally content with and all of your basic necessities are being fulfilled, i.e. having food on the table, shelter over your head, appropriate clothing for the seasons, enough money to pay bills, and just overall live comfortably.

  it's a bit unusual, but it could depend on a variety of factors. he may be hiding something, or he may look at twitter as his own personal social media where he can vent/talk without judgment.
  
  if you haven't done so already, perhaps have a serious talk with him about his reasoning behind why he doesn't want to add you on twitter. it could be a simple reason entirely, but let him know that you're not judging him and that you're just essentially curious as to why.

  i can be both simultaneously, to be honest. i'm either overly emotional to the point where it hurts me or other people, or i feel absolutely nothing at all. there's really no in between, and it's exhausting.
  
  really though, i do think it's better to feel everything as opposed to nothing at all. it's good to be enthusiastic, passionate, and dedicated to the things in your life as opposed to going through life without a single emotion whatsoever. negative feelings hurt more, without a doubt, but sometimes it's worth those moments because you also get to experience the great moments as well.

  i left work early at 1:00pm, so in the time i was at work, i was scrambling to get things done to make up for the rest of the day and tomorrow. after i got home, i made some food, took a shower, and threw some clothes in the dryer on a quick de-wrinkle cycle. i'm going into manhattan tonight for a comedy show, so i've been prepping for that. :'))

   This is fair. But in this case it’s not they have suspicions, it’s because the partner was not responding to texts messages and they knew their passwords to one of their apps like insta and saw that. Someone I know did this this so I am wondering.
  ","
  in that case, then i don't really believe that the person had the grounds to invade their privacy, so to speak. it's one thing to know a person intimately and understand that they're acting unusual, and therefore have suspicions that they're cheating and act accordingly. but it's something else completely to log onto their social media accounts solely because their partner wasn't responding quickly enough to text messages.

  being around my family brings out my insecurities, tbh. sometimes they wind up pointing out certain flaws about myself, which makes me even more self-conscious. my mother has a bad habit of indicating whether i've gained or lost weight and even goes into specifics as to where on my body the fat is, and it makes me horribly dysphoric.
  "
401787,"
   Do you think it’s justified if someone logged into their partner’s messaging app and realise that they have been cheating? I mean it’s an invasion of privacy right? What do you think?
  ","
  this is one of those gray area things, where both parties are wrong to a certain degree. however, i always side with the person who has been cheated on -- solely because most people are trusting their gut instinct that something is wrong, otherwise they wouldn't feel justified in invading their partner's privacy to check their messages in the first place.
  
  the person who cheated is, obviously, wrong. but i also think that not trusting your partner to not cheat is unfortunately common, and while invading your partner's privacy is wrong in most cases, a case such as this where their feelings were confirmed would justify going through the phone.
  
  this has happened to a few friends of mine, where they felt something was wrong so they went through their partner's phone while they were sleeping and discovered that they were messaging other people and/or cheating. they knew that going through their phone was wrong in the first place, but they wouldn't have done it had they not already had an idea that something suspicious was going on.
  "

  yes, i wholeheartedly believe that there can still be friendship after love. after a breakup, a person should take the proper steps necessary to be sure that they're over the person they've dated, so perhaps remaining friends with their ex right away may not work. however, i know of a lot of people who have rekindled their friendships with their exes after the fact, and their friendship is perfectly fine.

  when i broke up with my ex, it was because i realized that i didn't actually love him. i just loved the idea of him, and i didn't like spending time with him as much as i convinced myself that i was. he also lied to me on multiple occasions, and it was a toxic relationship considering our age difference. i didn't stay out of obligation, so i broke up with him.
  "
401802,"
   Is it wrong if I break up with someone for no reason other than I’m not happy. He’s not a bad person, he loves me but I don’t love him as much. I have been staying with him because I’m afraid I will hurt his feelings and his mental health worsen.
  ","
  no, that's not wrong at all. if you don't love him to the same degree that he loves you & you don't feel as if there's anything further you can do to strengthen the relationship, then there's nothing wrong with ending the relationship.
  
  you need to look after your own happiness, and if you're not happy, then you need to make the necessary changes in order to attain happiness again. there's no shame in that. don't stay with someone out of guilt -- they deserve to know the truth, as hard as it would be to hear.

  generally, i do believe that if someone has the capability to hold a job and they're not preoccupied by being a parent or a caregiver, then they may want to join the workforce, even just part-time. it's good to be doing something with your life and it will make you feel more productive. but if you don't *need* a job because you're financially secure, then you're not obligated to have one.

  ","
  in the united states, getting a college education is hella expensive, and the reason why some people only earn a high school diploma is because they cannot afford college. tuition is normally tens of thousands of dollars, and when you take out a loan for college tuition, you're normally paying it back for 10-15 years per month.

  etsy is a website you can visit to purchase handmade, unique products from self-sufficient small businesses and artists. you're directly dealing with an individual or group of people instead of a large corporation.

   How did real love feel like?
  ","
  like nothing i could have ever dreamed about, in the very beginning. alongside the obvious infatuation, i felt completely loved and supported in all possible ways and garnered a feeling of safety unlike anything i've ever experienced before. i felt understood and validated, like my thoughts and feelings actually mattered for once, and there was a consideration of my emotions and a valid response that i wasn't familiar with.
  
  we have similar interests and passions, and those passions and hobbies melded into each other. he felt like an extension of myself, and we were both amplified.

  no, i've been purchasing items from etsy for years upon years. delivery is usually between 1-2 weeks, depending on how unique the item is. most items on etsy are tailored to what you specifically request or are handmade, so the businesses/artists require more time to create the product.

  it doesn't bother me at all, except for when i'm the only one who is sober. depending on my mood, it can irritate me if my friends are being obnoxiously drunk and even sloppy. however, i also tend to feel very protective of my drunk friends because i don't want anyone to take advantage of them.

  it didn't happen to me directly, but during my ""party stage"" of my life when i was around 19 to 22 years old, my friends and i threw a house party. at the time, we were also into stealing random objects from the street and other people's properties, i.e. orange cones and barrels. we had a bunch of cones lined up inside of this kid's house, and one of my friends was drunk and stupidly decided to see if he could stab a cone right through with his knife.
  
  because he was drunk, the knife slipped and he sliced all the way through his thumb. he nearly passed out in the house because he doesn't like the sight of blood, so we hoisted him into my car and i sped him off to the emergency room. i didn't go into the triage with him, but apparently the nurses had a good laugh when my friend had to tell them how he sliced his finger. lmaoo.

   College while working or using parents money? Which is better and why
  ","
  i believe it depends entirely on the family dynamic. if the family is financially stable enough to support their child(ren) while they're attending college, then i believe that it's a right thing to do. college is stressful enough to begin with, and for some students, their grades could drop if they work a job at the same time since they're not committing themselves 100% to studying.
  
  however ... i also believe it's important to hold a job and study simultaneously, if you have the capability to do so. juggling multiple tasks at once is a useful skill for the future, and if you can successfully dedicate your time to work and school at the same time, then that's a really strong talent to utilize. not to mention the obvious fact that it always feel nice to earn your own money.

  i would like to publish a book (a novel, or a book of short stories, or a memoir, or poetry), first and foremost. i also want to further my progress with my own mental health and try to get to a position where i'm very stable instead of having a lot of bad days.
  
  i want to continue raising awareness for mental health and reform, and i also want to eventually move into my own house with my boyfriend and adopt a lot of animals.

   Do you believe in second chances? ?
  ","
  it depends on what that person did to screw up the first chance they were given, haha. i'll give some people second chances, but certainly not everyone. if a person blatantly disrespected me or my friends and knows exactly what they did wrong, and shows no remorse, then i won't give them another chance to redeem themselves.

  it's important to be selfish in order to preserve yourself from potential harm, whether it's emotional or physical. i place a lot of significance on self-care and doing what's best for yourself in circumstances where you're placed in a tough position, whether it's by friends, your partner, or your family. your feelings and wellness are most important and you should take care of yourself when necessary.
  
  you should be selfless when someone else is hurt or in harm's way, especially if they're a person who relies on you to help them. if you're in a position where you're comfortable enough to help them, i believe putting your own needs on the back burner and helping them is the right thing to do.

  ","
  it isn't shameful, bad, or weak to reach out for help when you need it. there's no such thing as reaching out too late, and looking for help when you're in need will only serve you in the long run. everyone needs help on occasion, and if there is someone in your life who is averse to helping you (meaning they simply don't want to, not that they can't), then their presence in your life isn't necessary anymore.
  
  i should have reached out for help over 10 years ago. i thought that there was no use in helping me, there wasn't anything i could be helped with, even though i was in substantial pain. when i *did* seek help a few years ago, though, it was absolutely life changing. looking for help is not weak. it's strength.

  i mean, it's common for couples to argue. but if you're continuously arguing about the same thing over & over, then that's an indication that there has been no growth or progress. there's no learning from the argument or understanding that things need to be changed in order to be better. you need to have open communication with your partner in order for things to truly work, and that also involves acknowledging when someone is wrong and taking the necessary steps to change.

   What makes your bf special? How did you know he’s the one?

  he's different from others in that he has stood by my side, supported me, and made strides to understand me on a personal level -- whereas everyone else in my life was quick to brush off my insecurities and mental illnesses because it was too much of a burden on them. he's had an innate understanding of my struggles from when i was a child through deep conversations, and instead of distancing himself because he didn't know how to handle it, he pushed forward and opened himself up to methods by which he could make things easier for me.
  
  we've gone through hell and back together, although that's a cliche way to really put it. we've endured struggle, addiction, death, as well as celebrations together. we've hit milestones together in terms of graduations and have watched people come and go from each other's lives, and he has been the one of the few people in my life who have been there through everything.
  
  he has inspired passion in me and encouraged me to delve deep into my craft -- writing. he's always been my number one fan and makes me so deeply proud of my writing, and his support is one of the few things that pushes me forward to write more.

  i'm doing fine, just recovering from a hangover from last night (lol). i'm supposed to go to the store today and pick up some items for my brother's birthday tomorrow, but i feel terrible so i'm probably going to do it either later tonight or tomorrow morning before we go out to dinner.

402153,"
   Do you think you would enjoy being famous??
  ","
  no, i definitely wouldn't enjoy being famous. i'm a very anti-social person to begin with and i don't like being recognized in public, so to be surrounded by fans or people who otherwise know me isn't appealing at all. it would only make me anxious.
  "
402154,"
   What do you think about Victorians postmortem photos?
  ","
  victorian-era post-mortem photographs, also called ""death photography,"" has always been incredibly interesting to me. it's an obscure and taboo practice and is now seen as disrespectful to the dead, but i still find it very alluring to research and read about.
  
  i was going to post a photo of it to accompany my answer, but they're really disturbing to look at and i don't think my followers would have appreciated it, lol.

   What is the quickest way to your heart answer even if you are taken.  Pretend that you are single
  ","
  honesty and communication, as well as showing that you're emotionally open and vulnerable. there's nothing more attractive than being with someone who is open with themselves regarding their feelings and is willing to discuss those feelings with you in order to make better sense of them.

402157,"
   What is one thing that immediately turns you off from a person?
  ","
  arrogance is perhaps the number one thing that immediately turns me off from a person. it's one thing to be confident in a healthy manner, but when that confidence turns into being conceited to the point where you believe other people are below you, that's a problem and it's not healthy or attractive.

   Is keeping  secret money hidden away from your partner a bad idea

   Quotation
  ","
  ""love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. and when it subsides, you have to make a decision. you have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. because this is what love is. love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. no, don’t blush, i am telling you some truths. that is just being 'in love,' which any fool can do. love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.""

   Has he ever felt threatened by your intelligence?
  ","
  not to my knowledge. to be fair, i'm not all that intelligent, lmaoo. i just know how to express myself well in writing. i'm a bit of a ditz in real life, it takes me some time to get certain jokes and i'm very up in the clouds unless i'm intently focusing on something, like at work.
  "
402207,"
   Who’s smarter you or your boyfriend? If you were to write something who would be better?
  ","
  depends on how you define intelligence. we're intelligent in different ways, tbh. i'm more book-smart while he's more street-smart, and he also knows a hell of a lot more about things such as animals, cooking, history, music, the trades (like carpentry, plumbing, HVAC, etc etc), and more. meanwhile, most of my knowledge is stuff i learned in college regarding writing and literature, lol.
  
  i'm a much better writer than he is, but he's also pretty good when it comes to creative writing. he seldom writes though, it's been a few years since he took some time to write creatively.
  "
402208,"
   Do you have a type?
  ","
  honestly, no. lmaoo.
  
  it's always confused me because my ""type"" is essentially people who are outgoing, bold, determined, not afraid to speak their mind, etc etc. it doesn't have much to do with their appearance, from my experience.
  "
402209,"
   but a level of education does define a person. I see marked difference between educated people and someone who just went to hs or dropped out and worked hourly jobs
  ","
  well, that's your prerogative. i see things differently than you do, apparently. i have friends who are both college-educated, only high school-educated, and who have dropped out of high school. there isn't much of a difference between them all.
  
  even though i have a college degree, i have an hourly job, lol. it's hard to actually find a job that's salaried unless you have much more than entry-level experience.
  "
402210,"
   Be honest what’s more important to you looks or personality?
  ","
  personality has always been more important to me. looks/attractiveness is important to a certain degree, but you can't base a relationship off of looks alone. it won't last, because that matters most in a relationship is the chemistry between two people and how well they communicate.
  "
402211,"
   Do your parents know you hate them?
  ","
  i don't necessarily *hate* them because that's a very strong word, but i don't believe they know how much i distrust them or the detrimental way they've influenced me and my mental health over the decades.
  "
402212,"
   Have you ever had a weird dream that you could never forget and it still haunts you when you remember it?
  ","
  yes. :/ i had a re-occurring nightmare when i was a child during times of high stress, and thinking about it still freaks me out.
  "
402213,"
   Why does your bio say non binary.  You are obviously a girl.  You likely even have a vag and ovaries and all that stuff too. You are not non binary - YOU ARE A GIRL. It’s ok to be lesbian or bi but this non binary i can’t decide what gender I am is crap.  Btw you are really cute though.
  ","
  uh, my bio says non-binary because, regardless of people such as yourself believe, that *is* my gender and it isn't something i'm confused over. i've known that i wasn't cisgender from the time i was a teenager.
  
  also, the fact that you're concerned over what sort of genitalia i have is quite concerning. i'm a total stranger to you. it makes me wonder if every stranger you pass by is questioned of what they have in their pants, hmm.
  
  another fact -- your sexual orientation is not correlated with your gender. i'm also bisexual, but that has nothing to do with my gender.
  "
402214,"
   Happy Thanksgiving to all you Americans! If you’re from a different country have a good day otherwise!
  ","
  aw, thank you !! i hope you have a terrific day.
  "
402215,"
   Who are you thankful for?
  ","
  i'm thankful for my boyfriend and close friends. they've been beacons of support for me for many, many years and i wouldn't have survived without their encouragement, open-mindedness, and lack of judgment towards my feelings or actions.
  "
402216,"
   Which do you think is more important: following the dreams your parents want for you or following your own dreams?
  ","
  following your *own* dreams is so much more important than following the dreams your parents want for you. you are not an extension of your parents -- you are your own individual, and you should live your life according to what makes *you* happy and fulfilled.
  "
402217,"
   What makes you really nostalgic?
  ","
  certain songs and other forms of music make me incredibly nostalgic for past times. music is honestly one of the only things that can stir up nostalgia for me.
  "
402218,"
   What is your favourite word or expression?
  ","
  my favorite word has always been either ""sanguine"" or ""maelstrom."" i don't really use either in my writing because it seems too unnecessary, but i've always loved the associations with those words.
  "
402219,"
   Can you tell when someone is truly sorry
  ","
  for the most part, yes. when someone is truly apologetic, you can tell in their apology, the way they behave, and how they change themselves after acknowledging they did something wrong.

   Are you lazy? Do you leave things to last minute?
  ","
  eh, i have the tendency to be lazy -- however, most of the time i just suck it up & do what needs to be done, otherwise it will give me major anxiety later on down the road.

   I love someone a lot and they love me too. they are asking to move to another city to live close to his child, I can’t do that. Is it selfish if I break up with them? The idea of them having a child is already hard to accept but now he wants to live 10 min next to his ex! Am I irrational?
  ","
  i don't believe it's selfish -- you're simply at a different stage in your life than they are right now, and they're always going to do what's best for their child. if that's something you cannot handle at the moment, then you're both going to have to come to terms with that. not everyone is equipped to handle dating a parent if they're not at the same point in their life.
  "
402256,"
   What are your plans for the weekend?
  ","
  tbh, i don't have any plans yet besides possibly going out with a close friend on friday night. it's her birthday & she's thinking about going to a local brewery, so i might meet her there and have a few drinks.
  "
402257,"
   How
  ","
  uh, they were s*icide attempts. i'm not going into more detail than that, though.
  "
402258,"
   Do you sleep your with your work clothes?
  ","
  definitely not, lol. one of the first things i do when i get home from work is change into pajamas.
  "
402259,"
   Have you ever nearly died
  ","
  yeah, it has happened to me a few times.
  "

   Favorite cake to have on your birthday?
  ","
  rum-soaked cannoli cake. :')) don't knock it til you try it.
  "
402261,"
   Do you wear new clothes/pjs straight away or whenever you need to?
  ","
  depends on what the clothing is, tbh, and how much i like it. sometimes i'll wear them right away, while other times if they're just ordinary clothes, i'll wait until i feel like wearing them.
  "
402262,"
   What's your favourite local dessert?
  ","
  freshly-baked rainbow cookies from the local bakery.
  "

   are you saying cadie is a liar?
  ","
  ???
  
  i don't see what cadence has anything to do with this? lmaoo. i literally only said that my askfm feed & account is active.
  "
402264,"
   What’s your annoying quirk?
  ","
  my entire persona is an annoying quirk, lmaoo.
  
  tbh, it's probably the fact that i think i'm annoying him/my friends & that they're always angry with me all the time. i ask them a lot if they're mad at me or if i did something wrong because i read too much into their texts or the way they phrase things.
  "
402265,"
   Do you think ask is dead?
  ","
  no, quite the opposite actually. at least for my personally, my inbox is always active and i do have to actively tend to my questions every night in order to keep my inbox at bay. the people i follow are also relatively active as well.
  "
402266,"
   Does your bf have a quirk that annoys you?
  ","
  he inhales/sucks on his teeth -- especially when he's concentrating, like playing video games. it makes that gross suckling sound & it irritates the hell outta me, lmaoo.
  "
402267,"
   Have you ever tried writing your diaries?!
  ","
  yes. when i was a pre-teen, i wrote in a diary/journal nearly every night. it was really one of the only ways i could release my innermost feelings, a catharsis in a way.
  
  however, i stopped writing in any sort of diary when my parents went into my room, took my diary, and read it without my knowledge or consent. i didn't trust them anymore and so i kept everything i did secretive.
  "

   Do you believe in zodiac compatibility?
  ","
  no, i don't put much faith in astrology.
  "
402269,"
   What were the diffrent types of students you had in your school
  ","
  in high school, everyone was pretty assimilated with one another and hung out with each other, or at least the groups inter-mingled somewhat. there were, of course, your typical ""preps"" and jocks, as well as the outcasts and nerds. but it's not as if they were all feuding against each other or anything.
  "
402270,"
   How much have you come to terms with your own mortality?
  ","
  i came to terms with my own mortality when i was a teenager. i've never been particularly afraid of death, and in most cases, i welcome death with open arms. death itself has always been intriguing to me & it's a frequent topic of my writings.
  "
402271,"
   When did you learn to be cute?
  ","
  i can assure you that whatever you may perceive as ""cute"" is simply the byproduct of years of angle-practicing, contrast/brightness/white balance monitoring, and filters.
  "
402272,"
   How often do you chew gum? ?
  ","
  i never chew gum. chewing gum allegedly makes teeth-grinding worse, and because i grind my teeth at night while i sleep, i try to do everything i can to prevent it from happening or being worse than it already is.
  "
402273,"
   Do you have a money box
  ","
  no. i have a wallet. lmao.
  "
402274,"
   did you get done at salon
  ","
  yes, i have a good friend who's a hair stylist. i went to her salon last night to get it done.
  "
402275,"
   strict regards what?
  ","
  when teachers are strict in terms of tardiness (i.e. when students are only late on occasion, but the teacher makes a huge deal out of it), strict in terms of understanding that their students have lives of their own, strict in terms of understanding students' hardships & life struggles, etc etc.
  
  when a teacher is strict to the point where it prevents students from enjoying the prospect of learning, i think that's bad. it's also important for teachers to remember that students are human, they all have struggles and lives and hardship, and teachers should give more leniency if a student is behaving out of sorts, especially if it isn't typical of them.
  "
402276,"
   Is it better than your style?
  ","
  i don't really have a style, so i suppose the automatic answer is yes, haha.
  "

   Do you support gun control in any way, shape, or form?

  yes, i am 100% in support of stricter gun control.

   What did you do when you're a college student?Do you like it?
  ","
  when i was a college student, i attended classes full-time and then i also worked part-time (which eventually led to full-time work while i was in school). i commuted to campus instead of dormed.
  "
402280,"
   How would you explain your basic life philosophy?
  ","
  ""if you're going through hell, keep going.""
  "
402281,"
   Would you rather have a lenient/carefree teacher or strict?
  ","
  when i was in school, i preferred the teachers who were more casual but also knew when to be strict from time to time. teachers who are *too* strict only discourage students from learning.
  "
402282,"
   shade
  ","
  i don't think there's a specific name for it or anything -- it's kinda like a chocolate brown leading into caramel brown with some blonde tones here & there. it's balayage.
  "
402283,"
   When was the last time you visited a Museum?
  ","
  tbh, it's been at least 4-5 years. :/ i went into new york city and visited a few of the museums there just for fun.

  usually yay -- sometimes nay. it all depends on the mood i'm in.
  "
402285,"
   even when you’re with your bf?
  ","
  yeah, my serotonin levels don't magically even out when i'm with him, lol. i have a chemical deficiency, as well as a host of other variables that have contributed to my depression.

402291,"
   I'm getting angry more often and getting more inpatient more often than normal is that normal?
  ","
  if you have external stressors in your life that are making you more prone to being short tempered, then yes that's quite common.
  "
402292,"
   Can love alone make a relationship last?
  ","
  no, love alone cannot make a relationship last. there needs to be communication and a foundation of trust & support in order to continue and strength a relationship. solely loving someone, unfortunately, is not enough.
  "
402293,"
   How are you feeling today?
  ","
  i'm doing well today -- much better than i have been in previous days earlier this week. i'm happy that i have tomorrow off from work (even though i have work on friday), so i'm going to relax tonight with a few spiked seltzers while watching television.

   Everyone likes your hair when it’s either blonde or brown. Finally you left your “acting out” phase.
  ","
  i wasn't aware that expressing a preference for unnatural colored hair is considered ""acting out,"" lmaoo.
  
  i like my hair brown. i also like it purple, blue, pink, and red. i like highlights & lowlights. i like bayalage and ombre. in general, i find it fun to experiment with hair color and style. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  
  it doesn't much matter to me what other people like. as long as i like it, that's all that matters.
