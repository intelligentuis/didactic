It has got a mysterious look to it, because you never know... life has its mysterious paths... also you never know what's going to happen when you take those paths... but you hope for the best.

And not like OMGOSH IT HURT type pain. No. Like a sunburn for like a week. Then it inched for maybe a week. Oh! (Advice here) when you get a tattoo and it starts peeling and itching do not itch or peel tattoo or color will come out.\n  \n  The second tattoo is a tattoo of a diamond. ?
