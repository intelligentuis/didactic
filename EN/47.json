Just the other day I heard a little girl she was like six or seven or eight and she was cursing her mom out in the mom didn't even care she just let her.\n  \n  And this is just one account. And say nobody is disciplining their kids.. but no.. I will give credit to the people that still are! but around where I am at (living), it seems that they let their kids get away with a lot. Everything really... But then I see it on YouTube and these are people like me.. Cause I Upload and watch.. And I see it and a lot of other places... Only states.. Countries...

I think that they should be careful with who they give a gun because some of these people are not mentally stable to have one. That is what I think is the sole reason to the shootings. They are poorly background checking these people. I mean even if they have even a slight problem wrong with them they should not be given a gun.\n  \n  Because I have seen somebody pull a knife on someone try to rob them and because somebody was concealed carrying they saved everyone's life in that building.. or at least the people that was around that lady. That guy with the knife, he put it down.. Out the miney down and everything and I think he started saying sorry and everything?! But he was about to kill people?! but if that guy wasn't carrying that day I think some of them people would have died.... But because that gun was put in the right hands he did the right thing. Saved lives...\n  \n  I think if people took more time out with distributing these guns to people.. so they could conceal carry them... then more lives wpuld be safe and  we would have less shootings. That's my answer.\n  \n  For a machine to work there has to be an operator. There has to be some sort of operator. Law of motion.\n  \n  People kill. People's choices...\n  \n  And the choice of giving a gun to a mentally unstable person can put lives at risk... Depending on what this issue is.

Just learn to adjust.\n  \n  Being judgmental is pointless and is a waste of time and just shows what kind've a person you are and is never a good thing that comes out of it.\n  \n  Get to know something or someone before jumping the gun.\n  \n  People need to spend more time outside and not inside.\n  \n  People need to realize underpopulation and overpopulation are both bad things and need to be regulated. With both people and animals.\n  \n  People need to know boundaries, also need to learn self-control.\n  \n  Some people need to realize that rules are different in different countries and  if they go to those countries they need to respect what happens there. (And I am talking about all countries, not just America. Some people go to other countries and get offended by how they dress. What they eat. Their government.)\n  \n  If you decide to go to Bangladesh. Then you need to respect and the people there and what they do.\n  \n  If you decide to go to Switzerland then you need to respect the people and what they do there.\n  \n  And same with any country.\n  \n  You need to respect their laws. You need to respect if they have curfews.\n  \n  This is a selfish type topic and discriminative topic I'm talking about. Closely related to the ones I already said above.\n  \n  I believe people should just accept.

You can get the beignet mix online or at your local Walmart store depending on where you live.\n  \n  2 cups of the beignet mix that you use and then you put just 8 oz or however much you put into the cup and then you mash up and make you some dough.\n  \n  Then you use healthy amounts of flour to dry up the dough perfectly to roll out into a flat surface to how thick you want the beignets.  I don't make him extremely thick. I make the dough about a quarter of an inch thick.\n  \n  Then you cut out how ever big you want your beignets to be.

Then get some powdered sugar and put it in a container. About a half a bag of powdered sugar and shake the Beignets in there and you're done. Then you have a crunchy juicy beignet covered in powdered sugar ready to eat. But eat them there now because they are hot and warm. You can continue to eat on Beignets for about 2 or 3 days after you make them but you have to microwave them to make them taste the same.

This is what kind of have me a little down yesterday at the end of the night. This is why I'm scared to have kids sometimes. Idk what I would do if that was  happen to one of my kids. It would not be pretty for the other person.\n  ","51446":"\n  Oh I don't even really specifically remember one recently but maybe a few of people growing up on me. Recently, a couple of my friends and family birthdays have passed. And some of the people are younger than me and just seeing them grow up, just lets me remember that life is moving and that I am growing also and I miss them as well. The people. The place is. The memories. They're all still here. It's just life is going to continue. And change.\n  \n  But also I saw a video that was sad. I don't know if that's exactly what you're looking for... but I feel that some videos move you to tears in good ways and bad ways.\n  \n  It was a horrible video. Some random lady just walked up to some couples kids and start stabbing them :( and the parents were trying to.. Like protector their kids and like stop the lady and the lady was trying to hurt them too... but was walking away??? after hurting the kids?? Only? like she just wanted to hurt them? I didn't really want to watch the video I just saw in the corner of my eye and thought it was horrible... I didn't understand but then then thought on it for awhile..\n  \n  But I don't care if she would have stabbed me... I would have beat the crap out of her... I just wish I could have been there...\n  \n  People nowadays think that some people shouldn't have kids... so I'm guessing that's why she did that to the children. To try to put them down. To try to express her hate towards certain groups of people. This is me assuming. Maybe she saw the couple and they weren't doing too well. Maybe seeming that they weren't raising the children right or something? Maybe they were on drugs? Maybe the kids were acting up and the parents weren't doing anything about it? Maybe that aggravated the woman in thinking...  some people shouldn't have kids because they're going to spread more of these kinds of people or something??\n  \n  I don't know. But regardless you do not do this to people. Children.. Does not matter what they do to you. But yeah.. ?...\n  ","51447":"\n  I don't know...lol but ain't much to it I'm sure.\n  \n  The most the time when people ask for it it's because they want to hook up.. or talk to me about inappropriate stuff or sending nasty pictures. Just sick. And even if you are married they still want it!? And I'm like okay...you meddling homewrecker?... This is why people don't get married anymore or are married for even a year. Because people are constantly meddling into their relationships. And people are giving in. No self-control. It's pitiful.\n  \n  And I'm not interested in any of the above... so there's no point in having the app? Ya know? Pictures. \"Chatting.\"\n  \n  The only thing I thought that was funny about the app was the funny features maybe? but there's so many creepy people it makes you not even want to have it..
