  I believe in global warming but the reason why the earth and its beauty is dying is because of us. Population increase, pollution, animals, sea life etc. Are all because of us. We control what goes on with the world. We control weatber to help make this world cleaner, efficient, and happy. But the sea turtles choking on plastic is our fault because most of us are careless about the products we disappear, or fail to require, or find something safer to use. How can we get rid of plastic safely is the question? The wildfires in california and australia how do we stop them? Why are they happening? What's around the can even cause a spark? How do we provide nutrient and a water source to the dry parts before hand? Questions I feel the world is failing to ask... That could be somewhat beneficial

   Favorite song?
  ","
  (An old video) but lisa took my part at the end because I was loosing my voice that day, I asked her backstage if she wanted to sing that part as it is a whistle note and I knew at the time only she could hit the note besides me (she's the only other high harmony. Although dani and christina have improved so much and can sing some high rangers). Lisa patted my shoulder at the time of that part to make sure I still wanted her to sing my part which I did. She did not purposely sing over my part at all, which sometimes happens but very rarely. As you can remember I hit the AdLib on her part of problem at vidcon one year, since then when performing we always do it together now.

   If a child somehow survived and grew up in the wilderness without any human contact, how “human” would they be without the influence of society and culture?
  ","
  Probably very little. Reminds me of the story about the little kid raised by wolves or even. Tarzan. If the stories are true and they survived by another creature looking after them then they'll mist likely have the same instincts as the creature that raised them. Or very little knowledge on how to talk, eat, relieve themselves. Kinda like those children horror cases you see where they're locked into a room deprived of food, socialization etc. And they're basically like featuses...

Shooter 15 turned 16 boy ""today and u see

Shooting a 14yrold girl and boy fatally and then shot 4 others but only injured and shot himself in head so cops arrived and looking for shooter but he was injured an brought him to 🏥 y
  ","
  No one knows what made him do it. Some believe the passing of his father made him do it. They brought him to the hospital because if he's Injured he has a right to see medical cared people and get treatment before the police take him into custody, they had to question him about why and all that. But unfortunately since he shot himself in the head he ended up passing away from his Inhuroes so no one knew what the motive actually was and couldn't find anything really linked to it.

  If you can't afford nicer skincare products, drinking a TON of water, exercising regularly, and cutting down on dairy and sugar always helps. Also not touching your face throughout the day, always washing all your makeup off at night, and washing your pillowcase regularly.

   🛏 I once had a friend who believed passionately that you should never give up your own bed for anyone.  🛏 If you have an overnight visitor who had travelled far to reach you, would you lend them your bed if there wasn’t a spare? Or make up a couch/floorspace for them as best you can?
  ","
  Well growing up we all shared rooms with 2 other siblings. So its was christina, Katherine, and amy in ome room. And lisa,dani and i in another. The guys Michael and alex shared and christian, nick, and joey. Amy with her condition would have to sleep sometimes downstairs as her body was to weak and she couldn't climb the stairs so we would have to move her bed, or make her sleep on the couch to the living room. Our younger brothers used to sleep over sometimes in our rooms and we used to all squeeze together to find room. Dani and I had a bunkbed and lisa had like a normal double or something. But as well grew older and finally moved to nashville we all kinda split up into our own houses. So there's like extra rooms and spaces. Amy and I had an extra bedroom that is off my room, that I gave to kallen when he stayed here. But now its Arielle's bedroom

  Being married won't stop me from living out my career and dreams. My sister, the oldest out of us 6 girls is married. and HAS been for a year now. And still continues to go on with her career and marriage perfectly fine. No marriage is perfect and we all understand that. But you need someone who understands your job and that as well. Now the whole topic on kids. I know christina would want to bring everyone on the journey with her. But once the child is born she said she will not really post photos of her children because she wants to respect their privacy and let them shape themselves into who they are. Which things change as well... But I'm sure there's a lot of singers,actresses etc. That do a job that isnt always easy, married and have kids and still balance it the best they can.

   Chapter four continued:

  Lynne also put the girls in dance classes, and eventually they found their way to musical theatre, which became a huge part of their lives. In 2002, the Cimorelli family joined a local youth musical theatre company. They spent several years doing 3 shows a year and all the Cimorellis who participated, including some of the brothers, really enjoyed the shows. They learned a lot about performance and how to put together a great show.
  
  During their time in musical theatre, many of the siblings also took dance classes including tap, jazz and hip hop, and workshops and classes for acting and improv. Their love for music continued to grow as they performed in musicals like Annie, The Wizard Of Oz, High School Musical, High School Musical 2, and Seussical The Musical. As they entered into their teen years, the older Cimorelli family was as obsessed with music as ever, and there always seemed to be music in the house, whether someone was singing, playing the piano, drums or guitar, or writing a song. Music became one of the central elements of the Cimorelli household as the kids started growing up.
  

  TO BE CONTINUED... next week, you’ll learn about the early days of the band, and where it all started!
  "
923198,"
   CHAPTER 4: The Early Days Of Cimorelli, part 2
  ","
  The Cimorelli parents, Mike and Lynne, were both huge music lovers, although in very different ways. Lynne had her Master’s Degree in Music with a concentration in piano performance. She was a classically trained pianist and vocalist, and the music she liked to play around the house was a diverse mix of classical pieces by some of her faves (Mozart and Tchaikovsky) and greatest hits CDs from the ‘80s (she loved bands like Toto and Jefferson Starship). Mike was never taught music in a formal setting, but he loved to blast music in the car while driving his kids around, or out in the garage while working on a car or project. His music taste was much more classic rock-focused, including bands like Pink Floyd, Warren Zevon, Neil Young and 10CC. Although Mike claimed he wasn’t a good singer, his kids noticed whenever he (loudly) sang around the house, he had a very nice voice and he also had an ear for intonation.
  
  Lynne wanted to experiment with how early kids could learn to sing in harmony, so she began teaching her kids how to sing harmonies when they were around ages 2-4. (You could say this was where the band, Cimorelli, was born, as harmony is the main hallmark of the group- but more on that later!) Lynne also wanted to pass on her love of piano to her kids, so she taught all of them to play the piano. The girls of the family especially loved playing the piano, and they would even argue over whose “turn” it was to play the family piano. Along with teaching her kids to play the piano and sing in harmony, Lynne also started a children’s choir at their church so they could start learning pieces of music and singing them at church. She taught them complex harmony arrangements and they started building their knowledge of classical music as kids. From children’s choir, their exposure to musical opportunities and experiences grew. Their grandma, Phyllis, recommended the older 3 girls, Christina, Katherine and Lisa, learn some 3-part harmony arrangements of barbershop songs so they could perform them at nursing homes and small community events. They learned songs like Don’t Sit Under The Apple Tree, Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, and Take Five and began performing them when they were around the ages of 10, 9 and 7.
  
  Lynne also put the girls in dance classes, and eventually they found their way

  Its not a crime as everyone has their own preference on what they choose to put on a food. Like we all have something that may seem ""weird "" to some people. Like my one friend used to put ketchup and mustard on a grilled ham and cheese panini and I thought that was gross. 🙄

   So you're very famous?😍😍😍

  I don't like considering myself famous. Because I can still live a pretty normal life and do the things I love without having to worry about making sure I have ""body guards"" and paparazzi around me (which we deal with when we are around like james for example.). But we have been having some issues where people are not respecting our personal, private lives and are invading. As in, coming to some of our houses and just like leaving weird gifts or whatever.(which have been reported because it was getting out of hand) but now some people are asking our friends for like our phine numbers. And are making ""fake"" instagram accounts etc. To make it seem like they ""attended"" a college chris went to. To get a follow to lurk into my personal life, and to ""prove"" a leaked photo of us was ""real"". And still continue to invade my privacy. Like if i wanted people to know, and was comfortable with the world knowing then i would share it when i felt the timing is right. But right now im not 100% comfortable or sure if anything is the right time. And logging onto a social media were i follow alot of people included into the cimfam and the first thing i see is someone bashing me and chris because they dont agree with my choices or what im doing. Or they dont like someone because their views differ from theres, or theyre not attractive to them, or because they believe they know the history and go based off one side they hate the person, but think theyre implied to hate on someone who they do not even know personally and say things that are really rude and toxic.    Its just to much at times, and I see why christina is kinda reluctant on posting things about what she's going through and why if she ever has kids there hardly will be any posts of them on her socks because she wants to respect and protect their privacy.... 🤦🏻 sorry for the rant just things i been dealing with for the pass two weeks since a stupid photo got leaked

  Figure out what's wrong. Go through all the major categories of your life ( friends, relationships, school, work, family, emotional state, mental health, etc.) And think about how they're going and exactly why they're going wrong. Then think about how you would like them to be instead. Figure out what steps you need to take to get them where you want them to be and start taking them. ❤

  Ahahah the best thing to do if you don't wanna start a convo is just look  at them until they look at you

  I know that's really scary, but you are not alone!!! And being diagnosed doesn't change anything about how your life is. You are still the same person and you still do the same things, you just have a better understanding now of why you feel the way you feel. You are not your illness!!! Don't let yourself get hopeless about it! You can work  to heal and learn healthy coping mechanisms and get to a place where your depression and anxiety is manageable!!! And there are so many of us right there with you ❤ Don't lose hope. You will be just fine keep fighting 💖
  "
923659,"
   How to cope when your crush doesn't like you back?
  ","
  Do everything you can to move on!!! Most likely, you probably don't know this person that well and you've built them up in your mind to be this perfect person that they actually are not. But even if you do know them well, you don't actually know if they would treat you well!! And if they don't like you, clearly y'all Ain't a match! If you are super devastated and torn up about it, that means that you were putting unrealistic expectations on this person to either make you happy or fill the void inside of you or make you feel like you're worth something, but the reality is no one can do any of those things for you. You need to love yourself, fulfill yourself in healthy ways, and cultivate your own sense of self worth and self love!

   Best way to make a career choice?
  ","
  Choose something that you are interested in. Something that you would be excited to wake up and and do everyday. Don't tell yourself you can't do something you really wanna do. Try it. Learn about it. Give it your best shot. If you're interested in multiple things TRY THEM ALL!!! You won't really know what you wanna do until you do it. Also know that if you choose something, you don't have to stick with it forever. You can change your mind and you change your course and it will not ruin your life. And don't let people choose for you.  You know what you need. You know what's best for you. 💖

  Meditation, figuring out what triggers it, journaling, making sure you take some time to yourself, therapy, even medication helps... But I would talk to your doctor first about it and he should be able to diagnose you with the type if anxiety u have, or disorder and may order you to do a genesight test which is just they swab your cheek with a cotton swab and send it to a lab to see what medications you can take base on your genes

  All of them do but the brain or the heart are probably the most important. Our brain is like the power source of our body were all our memories,thought and knowledge is stored and the brain sends messages to other parts of our bodies so our arms can move, we can speak a sentence etc. But we also need our heart. If our heart isnt working as the partner in crime for our brain then our brain shuts down because our heart isnt working and our heart needs to be pumped blood and beating to survive

   u cheated on sonny
  ","
  Yeah because on really sure you would sit around for a month waiting on someone who only talks to you when it was convenient for them or they actually missed you. You can try to call me out all you want and accuse me of cheating but in that whole month I tried to contact him, I tried to keep him in the loop, I left messages and everything. Only to be completely ignored. I didn't cheat I simply let go of someone who wasnt worth wasting my time on and MOVED on. There is nothing wrong with that. You can not make a relationship work especially if only one person is doing all the work. He could've told me he was busy or whatever but never did. Half the information I found out by looking at his profiles. Oh and let's also not forget that he's the one who actually cheated ... And blocked me and wouldn't explain why or whatever till months later. Let's remind you how he claimed over and over he loved me but completely fell of the face of the earth for months before I even got a simple hi from him. And then you claimed to love me but then go on to post you lied and are/is still obsessed with an ""ex "" who is in a relationship and I was like the rebound. I'm sorry but I will not stand to be used, manipulative, lied to, and a rebound for someone who doesn't value me. Sorry I found better and sorry that person treats me 100% the way I want to be treated. But its his screw up because I'm way better then the girl he's obsessed with and she doesnt have a thing on me.

   Hellooo! What is the meaning behind your new song ""Believe In You"" about ??
  ","
  So everyone is asking who wrote Believe In You! It was a complete collaboration between the 6 of us! Everyone wrote lyrics, christina did almost all of the chords and melodies and put the lyrics together and then I  produced it! Dani wrote the first lyrics we used for first verse and chorus and we went from there... and Lisa tweaked a couple melodies after christina had finished the song! And Lisa and christina both wrote the harmonies.  A true collaboration!!
  
  Dani was inspired to write believe in you because emmyn her fiance has been struggling with things in his personal life and not seeing his true value and that in life so while she was thinking she was thinking about him and what she sees based on what he does and how she could remind him that she like believes he can fix or imorive things. And then we all kinda tied it in with our own meanings. Because when do we ever tell ourselves that we believe in us? And say positive things. We always let things tear us down or we are our own worst enemy. Christina was thinking about a friend at the time who also been dealing with a lot of road blocks in life and started crying etc.

  This week with Lauren - 10/26
  
  This week I was #sick nothing major but I had a cold and it was pretty bad so there’s not many action shots in this week’s post 😪 some noteworthy moments: 1. our book is #1 new release in Teen and Young Adult maturing on Amazon !!!! (Not sure how many other books are really in that category but still that’s cool ahahaha) so thanks everyone for supporting this book its been so heartwarming to hear how much it’s helped a lot of you 😭😭😭😭 2. the last 2 videos are the practice and the final product of our Halloween performance thingy we did for some trick or treaters. For some reason we just can’t not be extra 😪😪 some of the little kids got scared and ran away during it so that made me rethink my life a bit but overall it went well ahahahah other than that I tried my best to rest and get well and not people please like I talked about in last week’s post !!! Did a pretty good job feeling much more rested and energized this weekend :’) how was your week? Let me know in the commentssss

  Probably 19 because I was still considered a teenager but I was like in this awkward position where I wasnt really a teen but was more mature and related into the adults more

  "
923916,"
   Do you think there are certain people who don't deserve to live
  ","
  Uhm kinda hard to say because I believe in this saying ""you can do the worst thing possible in life and still be forgiven although it will not be forgotten"" meaning that yes a lot of people will be disappointed that you did that but in the end only god knows the fate of you and even god forgives but doesnt forget.

923918,"
   Someone said why did Dani only say 2 words in the video
  ","
  I'm trying to back track a bit because this video was like recorded before or after we had to prepare for tour. And I think dani and amy were a bit under the weather. Me and lisa were in really weird moods ( hyper ) and amy always gets nervous when we have to do harmonizing challenges because she doesnt think she's any good at harmonizing or under estimates herself a lot. Same thing kinda with Danielle she thinks she's not doing it correctly or messing it up etc. Because their brains arent like tuned to catch onto the note right away like mine, christina and Lisa's are kath is a bit more slower... But she may have been annoyed as well with other things or just having a bad day in general. I don't really know
  "

  This week with Lauren - 10/20
  
  Technically this is the last 2 weeks lol these first pics are me as an alien for our annual Halloween party 👽💫☄️ also did the first 2 shows of our tour last weekend !! was so special thank you to everyone who came ❤️ on a more personal level, I had a big realization just this weekend. I’ve always had an issue with people pleasing and putting others first to the point that I completely forget to take care of myself and my needs. I’ve done a lot of work over the past few years to get over that and I was doing a pretty good job for a while recently but this week I realized that it was coming creeping back in. And I was doing things solely because I didn’t want to upset people and almost every conversation was so exhausting because I was hyper focused on how the person I was talking to was feeling and trying to respond in a way that I thought they wanted me to respond that I was completely losing myself. I’ve been running myself into the freaking ground trying to prove myself to everyone in pretty much every way you can and stressing myself out so much that I ended up getting sick and basically being forced to take a break and take care of myself. All that to say I decided that for this next week I need to protect myself and make sure I have the time I need to relax and decompress and be alone. I don’t have to be there for everyone all the time and neither do you!!!! If you relate to any of that, I really urge you to take a step back, take a breath and start putting your mental and physical health first. Don’t let yourself deteriorate in the name of being “nice”.
  "

  And just bevaise theres photos of him and I together at various events and a photo that MAY be edited to  look real doesn't necessarily mean there's something going on between the two of us. Its just me simply in a happy moment hugging someone else. Guys and girls can be friends.
  
  BUT PLEASE be respectful and stop tagging me, sharing that photo, asking who the guy is and if we are back together and PLEASE stop being ignorant and saying ""oh here comes acid rain 2.0"" because at the end of the day you only seen one side of the story unfold...

  Knew about it and I haven't been able to contact him at all the whole time while on tour. So think how I felt going through a recent breakup and having people come up to me asking if _____ was real referring to my best friend. I was very confused. Christian was at college in Alabama, he started to date a girl whose name was also lauren and I started to pick up myself, muted him on everything social media so k didnt have to see anything from him unless I chose to. And moved on in life. Well things change, people change, time even changes... We never are the same person we used to be even a minute ago. Years later christian moves back to his hometown and tells it was a misunderstanding, I forgave him... We are friends that is all as I'm seeing someone new

  JUST A QUICK RANT: there is a photo that a fan somehow got ahold of that is a photo of me and an ex whom many know know the name of already and the story behind. In 2015, my family and I included moved to nashville, Tennessee after a quick decision was made on an opportunity we had to act fast on. We moved miles away from a state, place and city we have lived our entire lives in to a state we were not that familiar with to get a fresh start on life. This means we also left many of our friends, family, and community behind. Getting settled in we knew no one, had no clue were anything was located or places that were popular to go to etc. And it took awhile to get settled in and actually liking things and knowing what's a good plave to even eat at etc. Upon moving I made a few friends months later and started attending a church I liked and many other activities. I met Christian Suray, a guy who went to the same church as I and was in the same youth group etc. And we just talked and becane friends. His family suggested he should take me to prom since he was like the only person I knew at the time and it would help me get to know places a bit better. I agreed to go with him. And later on my sisters kinda heloed him with his proposal as our new album ""hearts on fire "" was recently released at that time. They took photos which were later posted onto instagram for our followers to see and get to witness this moment with me. Fast forward, christian and I are friends and its like november at the time he asks me to be his girlfriend. I agreed. And I keep my relationship very private because I hate when people talk about it. Anyway things were good for awhile then I had to leave for tour and christian was focused on going to college in alabama at the time. So we decided to split even though I have grew pretty attached to him in the first few months of living in Tennessee. That was the only person I truly knew and the only friend I had at the time, so I was heartbroken to know that person was leaving so soon. I went on and continued with my life the best I could, focusing on my career and music. But I quickly fell into a dark place and became unmotivated and not myself. And the only thing that really helped at the time was writing acid rain about christian. It was the only way I could get my feelings out and feel a bit better. Christian ended up posting a video on youtube about his experience at prom with me and told them about us dating and then just being friends (which was made against my consent and was removed later that day). I was just in a dark place, and having fans constantly in my personal life was not helping at all. Eventually my feelings got to much and I started to shut down and break. I cried the first time we ever performed acid rain on stage in boston. Just thinking about everything going on and not being able to fully process my emotions. At the time I had a best friend but he was in love with me and then that added stress because my fans

  ","
  Just because they're taking a break doesnt necessary mean they're being the next one direction. ... You got to figure they been on pretty much a back to back tour. Everyday is a new town,city,state etc. They have to perform tonight. They need to be able to relax, enjoy some time to be home with family and friends and just have fun and rest their voices. You guys are also forgetting that jack has a baby now and she only gets to see him about maybe 4-5 times out of the whole tour schedule and actually spend time with him. Sometimes he's only there for a day before having to return to work. Think how he feels having to leave his daughter alone with his girlfriend to care for the whole time and not be there for many milestones and seeing her grow up? Think about the others who haven't seen their family for a long period of time ...

  Says the one who came out of NOWHERE and just started to go off on someones opinion? Without knowing the reasoning or story behind it.

Pray that somewhere down the line you learn a little thing or two about respect and that not everyones life is like yours and the same story. I'm sorry your life is so crappy and you have to take it out on other people whom you do not even know. You're own family must be embaressed as well to have such a judgemental person in their life. But you know what maybe your just having a bad day and I hope that soon you start having better days. I can pray for you to be a better person but I hope karma gets you 😘

  ""When we had to film official music videos for the label or go to red carpet events or photo shoots, we had different teams of stylists that would do the girls' clothing, hair, and makeup. They always brought clothes over to try on a couple of days in advance of the event, which was fortunate, because rarely was there anything acceptable to choose from. Everything was too short, cut too low on top, and the shoes were all stiletto heels. How is any of that appropriate for a 10 year old (or any minor, for that matter)?? I told the girls from the start to not be afraid to tell the stylists that they were uncomfortable with clothing like that and that it was off-brand for them, as they had built their huge fan base off of clean covers and good, clean fun. It was a good lesson for my daughters to learn to stand up for themselves and their values, and of course, I was standing right there behind them if anyone were to give them any grief about their stance. The stylists would then return with a new haul of better choices (although sometimes only slightly better), but this scenario happened time and time again, so clearly there was an industry norm or a directive in there somewhere that ran toward the inappropriate, even for minors.
  
  When we did our first professional music video with the label, I received an email asking if the older girls would wear something a bit more revealing. I showed the email to my daughters, and they were horrified. They wanted to sell their music on its own merits, not based on showing some skin. We put our foot down, and the outfits finally chosen were ones that my daughters were comfortable with.  ""

  ","
  I'm a singer in a band with my five sisters. We been a band for over 10 years. We got discovered after our cover of Miley cyrus's ""party in the usa"" went viral on YouTube. By a manager who works in the UK. She had a bunch of people meet us down in los angeles to perform with them... And we were signed to universal island records for a few years and had a lot of great times, opportunities, and met some amazing people. But a few years after they were trting to change us and turn us into something we will never ever be. And it left us devastated, lost of hope, and wanting to give up on our dreams for good and quit music. Then in 2015, we broke away from the la music industry and went independent artist under our own label and moved to nashville Tennessee for a fresh start on life after we were given an opportunity that we had to act fast on. Since then we came out with bunch of music, which shows our true selves and found out purpose of doing music again and the message we want to spread to our followers.

   Cimorelli ''Tour Medley"" Hamden
  ","
  Yeah, let me tell you lauren redid that whole track for the tour medley ( if you watched/ seen or went to any of the ILYOW tour shows earlier this year then you will know what I'm talking about). And no one was prepared for that lol. Amazing! To be honest and she even put one of the first songs they wrote before they blew up on youtube, ""Delaney"" in the mix. And I think the reason why Lauren isnt posting all the videos yet is because there's a few main cimfam members who were there that recorded and she's waiting for the better angle and audio. No offense to the person who posted that but lottts of screaming and singing 😂 - Arielle 🌻
  "
924657,"
   Great concert girls and is dani gonna release her own album or song yet she is so gifted do you agree?
  ","
  No one is 100% certain if dani will put her own album out. As she said she was going to make an ep once then totally privated, deleted some of the songs she made. But if you are a member of the girls on patreon then you'll know the girls put exclusive content up for only those members to see. And she has posted a lot of her ""original"" songs lately.
  
  Youtube got a few on there as well by her ☺ just we got to wait and see what the future has planned for each and everyone of us. Meanwhile enjoy what is going on currently - Arielle 🌻

  Thats girls watching the Sound check are those who have platinum vip tickets for being a oart of the believe in you your street teams. Which is promoting the tour and completing the  tasks which they were given by with myself or the girls. You have to live within an hour of the city in order to participate and message me and the girls via the street team page to receive the tasks and be apart of the team. The street team for boston and hamden were already made and you can no longer be apart of the team for these cities as of right now. Maybe if we do again in the future. But however there is still time to join the other teams  - Arielle

  I think she is alright, all of us girls end up getting pretty emotional when we have to perform because the songs are relatable, super personal and we put all our emotions into these songs and when one of us starts to cry its like a chain reaction. Even if its a fan... So I think that might be the reason why or maybe something she's dealing with at the time which I will check into... But thank you for looking out for us

   If your partner said “i have doubts about what you really feel idk maybe i’m just fucked up and it’s my brain telling me,” how would you feel? would that make you feel shitty and enough reason to break up?
  ","
  Well in this case it would probably be because you're not showing enough interest in them or you're coming off more involved with someone else. However if you actually have feelings for your partner then you need to bother sit down and try to work through that roadblock and compromise either spending more time together or whatever. But sometimes things don't always work like that and the best thing to do is walk away until maybe sometime the time will be right for the both if you to try again

  Maybe she's seeing someone that you don't approve of?

  Previous injuries can deteriorate over time. Kinda like a mental health issue. You're mental health can get worse over tine based on living situations.

And I used to love my best friend Elise's brother Ryan Norton. ALSO my love interest in all my friends say was a guy named hayden, that girl should be me was a male actor, fall back was a friend, eric lautner was also in our videos. And I used to date on of the laut twins but oh wait you wouldn't know any of my ex's besides christian because I never went public with any of them.

   What’s the difference between loneliness and being alone? Do you believe that the capacity to be alone is the capacity to love? If you feel a certain feeling, do you just let it be, own it, or you have to distract yourself from it?
  ","
  Loneliness is actually having no one around and feeling alone because well you are. Being alone is more of a choice because you have people that want to be around u and that. And I think being alone just means you need a period in time to have just you time where no one is around and you can relax, think about stuff and process and work on bettering things. And I try to get more in touch with how I'm actually feeling and talk about it, write, or process it like going on a walk to calm down

   CHAPTER 3: The Early Days of Cimorelli, part 1
  ","
  When the oldest child, Michael, was young, Lynne saw a TV show interview about homeschooling. In it, a 14-year-old girl spoke about attending college and excelling. Lynne was intrigued, but also a bit wary about homeschooling; it was the early 1990s and homeschooling wasn’t very common. However, she did not enjoy her school experience due to a combination of bullying and skipping a few grades. She was ahead of her classmates and had memories of sitting in class, staring out the window, waiting for the lesson to be over. She wanted her kids to be able to go at their own pace, even skipping several grades if that was what was right for them.
  
  She shared her thoughts about homeschooling with her husband and he was on board. They decided to homeschool all of the kids from kindergarten through 12th grade. She developed her own curriculum based on classic literature, Latin and Greek, the Catholic faith, and critical thinking. She wanted her kids to learn to think for themselves, to be curious and love learning, and to have strong moral compasses.
  
  Lynne had heard of other families who homeschooled out of fear of the world and wanted to isolate kids from that, and she did not want her kids to be isolated. And so, she signed them up for every activity possible in their area- swim team, musical theatre, basketball, gymnastics, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, karate, and many more. Her kids grew up to be a loud, vibrant bunch. They were very well “socialized” and had a lot of friends. Most people didn’t guess they were homeschooled when they met them because of their social and people skills.
  
  To this day, the Cimorelli's count their homeschool experience as one of the greatest tools in their lives and careers. Because of homeschooling, they had a lot of free time to learn instruments, practice singing and harmonizing, and write songs. Homeschooling gave them the space to be free to be themselves. Being unique and independent was highly valued in the Cimorelli household; they were not told to “fit into the mold.” This ideal shaped their music and decisions for years to come.
  
  TO BE CONTINUED… more on the early days of Cimorelli coming next week!

And tried to be social even though I wanted to go home all day because I felt tired and like I was going to get sick. Anyway just got home from working and that... And I just had enough for tonight I don't feel good, I want to cry.. I feel angry and I can't eat right now because I feel like throwing up and people just dont really take their words and actions into consideration so that makes my mood worse ..

  This week with Lauren - 9/29
  
  I had so much energy this week mentally and physically and I think there’s a couple things that contributed to it... 1. I started going on a walk every morning and praying the rosary by listening to it on this rosary app I have while I walk. Changes my morning so much, brings so much more peace and clarity to my day!?? 2. I started drinking a gallon of water (128 oz) everyday which is keeping me so hydrated which makes me feel better physically and also is making my skin look so good ??? 3. I read this 70 page book at 10 pages a day called “Searching For and Maintaining Peace” and it changed the way I view God, myself, the people around me, my goals, literally everything. If you are seeking a deeper relationship with God, this is a MUST READ!! Every time I think I can figure everything out on my own, I always find out the hard way that the best choice for everyone involved is just to rely solely on Him. 🙌🏼 Trying my best to do that. how was your week?

  If youre only with that person just because they are attractive then you need to go home, stop dating and take a look in the mirror because that's the saddest thing I have heard and kinda makes me mad. LOOKS ARE NOT EVERYTHING. ITS What's ON THE INSIDE THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS!!!

   If you had a daughter, would you consider sending her to the TV show ""Toddlers and Tiaras""?
  ","
  Definitely not. I want my future daughter to know she's always beautiful even if she may not see that herself, others say different or she feels there's prettier girls out there. I want her to know she will be loved for who she is on the inside not the outside. That TV shows and magazines are not reality and are made out to just try to turn you into something you will never be just so they can make a profit. I want her to be confident, bold, caring and so much more. And not turn into some girl that is stuck up, has to have name brand everything and the most expensive things. I want her to live a simple but comfortable, happy life and get to experience the world. The show like toddlers and tiara basically make up tons if drama between the children and the parents. They spend thousands of dollars on just one outfit the child will most likely only wear once and never again. Flippers to have the most ""perfect smile"" when there could be absolutely nothing wrong with it. And tons of makeup that makes them look like a life sized baby doll, which completely takes away their actual characteristics and transforms them into awhole other person. Which why do we all want our children to look the same ? And I literally seen a child get starved on an episode because her mother didn't want her to gain any weight because she had to maintain a certain body image no thanks.

  Be realistic with yourself about what you can actually do. It might not be realistic to try to exercise everyday or stick to really stick eating habits so try something more balanced like exercising 3 times a week or eating 2 healthy meals a day and then one that's whatever you wanna eat. Be gentle with yourself and figure out something sustainable for  you and your lifestyle 💛

   Our family continues to grow chapter 2 continued:
  ","
  brother in the house who was so little
  
  There seemed to be a pattern that each sibling was extremely different than the one right above them. Nick, the next brother born, was no exception to that rule. Where Christian was more quiet, thoughtful, and even philosophical, Nick was wild, fierce, and a force to be reckoned with. Nick had endless energy and hated sitting still for longer than a couple minutes. Nick was very stubborn and particular about things, similar to his sister Christina. Christian was so excited to have a brother so close to his age, as they were 18 months apart, and they quickly became best friends.
  
  In the year 2005, the family was completed. The last boy of the family, Joseph, nicknamed Joey, was born and he completed the trio of the youngest boys. Joey, like Nick, was full of boundless energy. He was known to run around and play with his siblings nonstop until he would randomly fall asleep in the family room. Joey was easygoing and very smiley, and like his older siblings, loved music from a young age. Joey would sing often and loved to entertain his older siblings. Christian and Nick were so happy to have another little brother to play with, and the three of them became inseparable.
  
  To be continued..
  
  Next week, we will learn more about the early days of the Cimorelli family!
  "

   CHAPTER 2: The family continues to grow
  ","
  Only a year after Amy was born, the Cimorelli family welcomed another child, Alexander. They started calling him Alex almost immediately. Along with Lisa, Alex was one of the more introverted and shy members of the family. Whenever anyone came to the door, Alex would hide behind his mom. He was very thoughtful, observant and analytical from a young age. As a kid, Alex could be described as “a man on a mission.”  He was incredibly curious and used to empty out all the drawers in the house, make huge messes and stick things into the outlets. Alex was also always very sunny and smiley, and whenever people met him, they instantly loved him.
  
  Two years later, Lauren was born, continuing the long line of girls in the Cimorelli family. Lauren loved music and learned to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in Latin at the age of 2. She was also fearless and kept up with her older siblings. She loved skateboarding and swimming, and was confident in her ability to succeed. She was also very serious and focused, and sometimes if something she did seemed less than perfect to her, she would burst into tears of frustration. Lauren loved fashion and putting together fun and funky outfits. Christina loved dressing her up as a “model” for photoshoots, and as usual, Lauren was up to try anything!
  
  Not long after Lauren came into the family, another little girl was born. Danielle, although close in age to Lauren, was very different from her older sister. Where Lauren was more sporty, Dani (her nickname from a young age) was more of a girly girl and was obsessed with carrying a purse and a pink toy cell phone. Dani was sassy and fun, and up for any adventure. She loved making up games with her siblings, often creating her own “restaurant”  or “cafe” and cooking food for her siblings. Dani was quick to learn and try new things, and always excited by a new experience.
  
  The next child in the Cimorelli family was another boy, Christian. He was naturally deep, inquisitive and very smart. More on the introverted side, Christian loved reading and music. He started playing the drums when he was 2, learning new rhythms very quickly and with ease. Christian also loved writing songs and he made his siblings smile with the lyrics he came up with. By the time Christian was born, his older sisters Christina, Katherine and Lisa were quite a bit older than him (ages 9-12) and they loved having a baby brother

  ","
  Katherine was the third child. She was very different than her 2 older siblings. While they were both more intense personality-wise and welcomed confrontation, she was much more peaceful and avoided conflict. She was social, made friends easily and loved being with her friends more than anything. She was also sensitive and artistic, spending hours getting lost in books and poetry, as well as writing her own poems and stories. She was very passionate about musical theatre and she was in 16 musicals. Towards the end of her time in musical theatre, she was given a few comedic acting roles and realized how much she loved comedy.
  
  The fourth child was named Lisa. Lisa was similar to Christina in that she was perfectionistic and driven, but in a very different way. Lisa was very deep, self-reflective and analytical from a young age. She loved to sing and perform for her family members, often original songs she made up as a young girl. She was athletic as well, excelling in triathlons and figure skating. She was very quiet until she started to slowly started to come out of her shell around the age of 12, and out of the oldest 4 kids, she was by far the most introverted.
  
  Amy was next. The fifth child in the family, Amy was the smallest of all the kids. It got to the point where she didn’t seem to be growing at all for a long time. At age 9, she was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Turner’s Syndrome, which, among other things, affects growth. Other than being the smallest member of the family, Amy was also the most social, outgoing and people-oriented. She always had a big smile on her face. Any time a guest came over, Amy would take them by the hand and give them a tour of the house. She also was born with the loudest, most powerful singing voice in the family. Any time Amy sang, people were blown away to hear this huge, powerful voice coming out of a tiny girl.

   Our story : chapter one
  ","
  OUR STORY BEGINS many years ago in the small town of Lodi, California where a girl named Lynne fell in love with music. Lynne was a focused, driven individual and she devoted many hours to her two main hobbies- piano and swimming. She went on the excel in both, becoming an All-American swimmer and earning her Master’s degree in Music with a concentration in Piano Performance.
  
  In college, while Lynne was practicing piano for hours a day for her recitals, she met and fell in love with a passionate Construction Engineering Management major named Mike. The story is that a mutual friend connected them, and they ended up meeting in the cafeteria to talk one on one for the first time. They ended up talking for so long that they lost track of time. Only when people started coming into the cafeteria for the next meal did they realize they had been talking for several hours.
  
  They were friends for four years. Over those four years, they remained friends but didn’t date as Lynne always had a boyfriend. However, once she was single, Mike started dating her, and that was where they really got to know each. While they had both been raised Catholic, that was as far as their similarities went. Mike’s family was a loud, Italian crew while Lynne’s quieter Norwegian-Irish family interacted completely differently. Still, they fell in love, and they ended up moving to a small town in the hills of Northern California.
  
  Neither of them had planned on having a big family, but they were open to whatever God gave them. About every 18 months, they had a baby; and so, 11 kids were born. Oldest to youngest, they were named Michael (Mike Jr.), Christina, Katherine, Lisa, Amy, Alexander (Alex), Lauren, Danielle (Dani), Christian, Nicholas (Nick) and Joseph (Joey).
  
  The oldest kid, Michael, was born in 1989. Energetic, outgoing, and a risk-taker, he had an “engineering brain” from a young age. He was known for working on endless projects- taking computers apart and putting them back together, working on cars, and building half-pipes and jumps for skateboarding escapades with friends. He begged his mom to get him a guitar, and once he received it at age 12, he played rock and metal for hours a day. He was friendly and social, but also fiery and fearless.
  
  Next in line was the second child, Christina. Christina was driven, perfectionistic, and a born leader. When she was 7 years old, she asked her mom to order her a planner she had found in a catalogue. She waited every day for it to be delivered. Then when she received it, she scheduled out her days, including blocks for “free time.” With her focus, determination and talent, she excelled at anything she tried, achieving level 6 in gymnastics, breaking records on swim team, learning the piano at age 2, and earning lead roles in musicals. She became a leader for her siblings, setting the bar high in her accomplishments and moral standards.
  
  Katherine was the third child. She was very different than her 2 older

   THIS WEEK WITH LAUREN❣❣❣
  ","
  This week with Lauren - 9/22
  
  First off the seventh picture is a pic of the wound on my forehead after my laptop fell on me during an extreme Netflix binge... so be careful out there kids. (Not pictured on here but my insta) This week I think I did pretty well with managing the amount of pressure I put on myself. I found myself a new mantra for when I start freaking out about potentially not doing something perfectly: “I could choose peace over this.” And then letting it go as best I can. I’m trying to start seeing succeeding and doing well as an option I get to choose rather than something that I absolutely must do or else I will die cause with the amount of anxiety that whole concept causes me, it seems to be that I’ve been seeing it as a life or death thing. I’m reading a book called “Searching for and maintaining interior peace” and I would highly recommend it for anyone seeking peace. All in all had a pretty good week 👌🏼 excited to have an even better one next week!

  Keep your head up no matter what is going on and continue to stay strong and fighting whatever battle has come your way. Just because its a bad day or week,months, years doesn't mean its permanent. Remember to always give it one morenight because we never know how much can change overnight. Also remember suicide or taking your life doesn't mean getting rid of the pain you feel... But passes it along to someone else to deal with. So be thoughtful. Hugs and such love and prayers you feel better soon 💛

  This sounds weird but it is really a choice for me. I choose to be myself, to say what i think and what i feel, and do the things i want to do regardless of how i think people might respond. Confidence isn't really about not caring what anyone thinks, it's about choosing integrity over the fear of being judged and deciding you are worth being known and happy. ❤

  I went to Havana almost two years ago now. With my sister dani (the youngest) and our father.

The organization helos provide safe clean water to those in need by installing filter systems. You can learn more about it on the videos we have done. Or by reading more about it on their website. Had an absolute amazing time and loved learning about the program and what theu do. Unfortunately even though i was super cautious to not drink or use the water ... I ended up getting sick and was hospitalized due to tainted water exposure

   Roadtrip is 5 disrespectful faggy who are vaping on a m&g and blowing it on a fan's face and Rye pushed a girl away. This is why Why Don't We is better. Roadtrip is canceled !!
  ","
  Going to reanswer this, since i feel way better and can actually sit down and focus instead of trying to do three things at once. They are human. We make mistakes. Even the leaders of our countries have made mistakes and our role models because nothing in life is perfect, but what we jhst consider to be ""good enough"". The boys are still young ranging from mid 20s down to 18-19. They are still learning who they want to be and what they want to do and their message. Which can take years to figure out and tons of experimenting. Trust me i know. Im 21  it took us two years to figure out our style and to find our voice after being let down by the la music industry. It took us years to find out what our passion and purpose was. Growing up in the spotlight isnt easy as well as you may think it is. Youre under the spotlight 24/7, you dont get to be a ""normal kid"" because your life now revolves around impressing others such as the fans, the labels, the managers and partnerships. You dont have time to go out and play with friends in the mud and live out your reckless side by racing eachother down the street on your bike. You don't have the freedom to say certain things like a kid would because it will backfire and be held over your head for years ..for example look at the paul brothers probably the most hated youtubers there is idk. But jake does stuff that is dumb and reckless and the media and that hold it over his head for years and call him a bad person for just doing something he thought was fun or cool. So think about the guys ... They dont get to live out their childhood or have fun like everyone else does because this is their lives now and they are always in the spotlight being watched on every move they make... Because no one has the respect to just let them be happy and have fun and do what they love. You guys criticize everything they do because you dont ""agree with it"". You dont want them to make mistakes like a normal human being does and learn from   it. Or you dont even sit down and think for a second what they deal with on a day to day basis or how they feel. You think you know their personal lives like the alphabet and get upset when they decide to keep things personal because you guys intrude on it. You guys dont respect how hard they work for you, to put on a show, to put out music, to even try their hardest to atleast make you guys hapoy. But youre to focus on who they hang out with, who their girlfriends are, what they done in their past, them vaping, them being rude because they mightve had a hard day. You guys never take their feelings into consideration. Another thing is they spend so much time away from their families 99% of the time and only see  them a few times out of the year you guys never think that maybe theyre homesick as well? Cba i love these boys so much. And if you cant take their feelings into consideration then you dont deserve to be in the fandom. Comparing a person to   another is just wrong on another topic. Plp

   You're about to get in a fight, what song comes on as your soundtrack?
  ","
  I never really got into a physical fight with someone. However when me and my younger sister dani got into an argument she once locked me out of our room that we shared with our older sister lisa as well. And refused to open the door, so therefore i sung ""we belong together"" by mariah carey under the crack in the door until she calmed down and let me back into the room.

   What's the most unprofessional thing you've seen someone do?
  ","
  Uhm yesterday i went out for lunch at a local little diner in town it was around I want to say 1:00 pm and there were three females working and the cook. Well the one girl was on break and getting ready to leave for the day. She told us we could sit wherever, and she will take our order for the drinks (pop,water,juuce etc.) And our server will be with us in a minute. The girl was super polite and professional. The server i dont have much postive feedback on. She acted like she didnt even want to work, in the back talking the entire time, and then what made me mad was the other girl who helped us earlier seen a old couple walk in and told them they could sit wherever they want as the place wasnt that busy. The server walked out and told them she will be with them in a second but rilled her eyes and said in a very snotty way ""or not"". Then when my mother  went to go pay after we had finished eating  the server once again was very unprofessional by having a snotty attitude about taking the coupon off. My mom didnt tip her because of the way she was acting. She also didnt do her job like she should have, leaving the other girl to take care of the customers or having to call her out if HER customers needed something. Just was highly disrespectful and i dont think we will visit there for awhile.

  Im laughing at the fact you sent this to me and people im friends with or love with everything inside of me. The fact you literally just want attention or to start drama, is hilarious. Are you really that desperate for your five seconds of ask fm fame? Do you really envy that much to hide behind a computer screen on anonymous and send hate? I may not be the prettiest girl that came out of a vogue magazine but looks do not matter. I may be ugly to you but atleast i dont have an ugly personality 🤷🏻 atleast i have a good heart and treat people with respect and know if i have nothing nice to say, then dont say it at all. So your opinion does not matter to me at all. And heres your little five seconds of recognition for being a rude person.

  If any one has twitter can you please report the h*ck out of this account?!? I seen hateful comments come from this account under SEVERAL cimfam accounts just sending hate towards dani. Im sorry but since when did my sisters life and choices that are not a bad thing become anyones concern or right to say what she can and cant do? You claim dani is your favorite from the band but you send this?! Fake fan alert and we definitely do not need this negativity and toxicness in the fandom at all :( sad people cant just let people be and let them live their life. Dani deserves nothing but happiness and love. Instead of tearing her down why not try to be nice and uplift not just her but others in the world as well...

   LIFE UPDATE!!!! :
  ","
  This (month) with Lauren - August.
  
  Hello everyone. I haven’t posted a “this week with Lauren” in a minute and that’s because to be honest, the last few weeks have been really difficult for me. These pictures are all the good and fun times I had, but there was so much hard stuff going on in between each one. I’ve always been a very private, emotionally repressed, conflict averse person and I had to deal with a lot of things in the last few weeks that required a lot of me emotionally. Such as tuning into myself and diving into a lot of painful deep dark feelings that I would have loved to just avoid, having a lot of really hard and vulnerable conversations with people I really care about, asking for what I need emotionally from people when I’m used to just taking care of all my needs myself, standing up for myself and setting boundaries, and having to trust people and let go of control when I have always been a very skeptical and controlling person lol Just want to remind everyone that life is not a walk in the park for any of us. And that it’s okay. You don’t have to be at your best all the time. You don’t have to be strong for everyone else. You don’t have to pretend like everything’s fine and continue on with this crushing weight on top of you all the time. It’s okay to take a beat, to take a minute, to take a day, a week, a month, whatever it is and just repair yourself. Not push yourself. R e p a i r yourself. You’re not letting everyone down, you’re just honoring yourself. ❤️

  "" Right as it was happening I thought, “I am going to die... I could die right now.” I closed my eyes as I experienced the feeling of smashing into a car and the airbag opening, and that loud, loud sound that accompanied it....then I opened them and I was alive. I called 911 and opened my mouth to talk and nothing came out...the woman who answered was saying things but I couldn’t tell what she was saying. Luckily, a man appeared at my window and grabbed my phone and talked to her and told her what was going on. The accident continued to flash through my mind every other minute as everything went on and as Nick drove me home from getting checked out, his phone went off super loud on his car stereo and I instantly burst into tears from the loud noise. I just kept repeating “I’m scared I’m scared I could have died” for a long time up until I finally fell asleep that night.... only to wake up in the middle of the night to my ears ringing and the accident flashing through my mind again and again. •
  
  The last couple days I was very tired, sore, bruised and just very subdued and contemplative. I realized just how grateful I am to be alive, that no one was hurt and that I can wake up and breathe every single day. It blows my mind to think that I could have not been here.... but here I am. •
  
  I’m so grateful to all the first responders including my husband (second picture) who were there immediately to help us all and keep everyone safe. I wanted to post this as a reminder to wear your seatbelt and that you never know when you will need to slam on your breaks so pay extra attention every time you drive. 💗💗💗

  "
927248,"
   I think Emmyn changed Dani
  ","
  Not agreeing or disagreeing. Or saying youre right or wrong, but the only person who can CHANGE anything is YOU. Yourself. If you dont like your hair you go to get it cut, if you dont like your outfit, you get a new one, if you dont like your career you look for better. Etc. So emmyn didnt really change her... She changed herself. Also little rewind, dani was 7-8 when she became a part of the band and into the publics eye. She could never be an actual child, as well as me and do or say certain things because she would get criticized for it and people wouldnt agree. She was hated on for being skinny as a child, to pale,  to talkative, to bossy seeming, annoying and told she wasnt a good singer. We been on the internet for over 10 years so think how long it has been. She also got compared to   me and the other sisters about who can sing better and whose the most prettiest and more to be sucessful. So this may be why she decides to change her hair styles up, change the color, cut it short, have bangs, dye it etc. And why she changed her style so many times as well. She tried to be edgy to make friends and get more people to like her. She also was really inlove with someone and he hurt her pretty badly as well as a friend of ours at the time. This is why she cried on stage, wrote many songs about him and then to have deja vu all have it repeated in the same way with someone else? She lost her confidence, her self worth, self love and it has been years trying to get her to feel happy and confident again. She has spoken about how she cant even log onto twitter anymore without seeing messages and tweets about people being so rude to her expecially the harmonizers fans at the time. So in a way i think emmyn has taught her how to love and be confident again in herself, maybe theres a deeper meaning to this on why shes doing it or bottled up emotions that are finally coming out and the only way she can express these is by changing herself and telling her story through the changes

  Take away all their new stuff or favorite things and replace them with older things until they learn their lesson for example : those shoes you're wearing are ugly and cheap. Have my child wear cheap clothing.

  So I'm currently crying again. I cant believe how strong our cimfam is and just how loving, uplifting and supportive each and everyone are. Sitting here thinking that god was watching over christina two days ago... And saved her.. I was scared, scared when I got the call, scared to see the truck like that, scared to see my sister in that condition. But mostly scared to lose a loved one. Christina is the oldest sister of is 6. She's my birthday twin, both born on august 12th. 8 years apart, christina has inspired me in so many ways, motivated me to always try my hardest and stand up up for what I believe in. Shes like a second mother to me and took care of me along side my parents growing up. She is the most lovable person, inspiring, motherly and greatest human to know. Me and her have the most strongest sisterly bond even if its not really noticed. Hence why I am lauren CHRISTINE. But just thinking back on everything we done and our memories. It makes me really cherish our sisterhood more. Because I honestly don't know what I would do without her. And we never know when our last moments may be. I'm glad she's going to be okay #prayersforchristina

  Opposites attract. Go for the boy who tries their hardest to grab your attention. The one who has been there for your heartbreaks, your accomplishments, and even if you moved across the country he still follows you and chases you because your the one he wants. I know this sounds cheesy but its true. A guy that truly loves you will do anything to keep you, even if you have to move

  Its not a thing to go off on me for... Although the situation was minor, we did have dogs growing up. I was at a friends house one day, my hair was nicely done and styled and her dog who was somewhat aggressive got loose and ran to me and started biting and pulling on my hair and other dogs joined in. We have a family dog named jessie. And my older sister christina and her husband have a dog named frankie. Theyre okay but just not 100% comfortable with them

  Hello
  "
927942,"
   When was the last time you revisited something from your childhood? How did it make you feel? Do you enjoy indulging in Nostalgia or do you prefer to leave your past in the past?
  ","
  I always go back to california to visit friends and family and work on things down there. Recently I went back to our old neighbors in malibu and in el Dorado. The neighborhood in malibu was completely destroyed by the wild fire and the only thing that remained was a bit of the fence. I was little sad because that house was basically my childhood and I remembered everything that had happened while living in the house amd how it looked even when we moved in 2015. Sometimes its good to look back on your childhood and see how much has changed, you grew, and learned. And a house doesnt make your childhood but a bond and memory

   What does it take for your to forgive someone who has wronged you? Are there any people who you haven't forgiven/never will forgive, and why?
  ","
  I think they need to show me they truly are sorry for doing me wrong and actually mean it. There's been at least five people who have hurt me pretty bad and I don't think I can ever forgive them for that. Because they never took feelings into consideration and it was always about how they felt
  "
927951,"
   What was the last bad decision you made? What impact did it have and how did you manage to overcome it?
  ","
  Being associated with someone whose a cloudy chaser. Drained me and made me feel bad but eventually I just cut them out my life for good
