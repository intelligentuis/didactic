On the side of really annoying and way to focused on one thing: That thing being me and any other Sam-Dean out there. Do know we're actually characters that play story lines and there are real people like you behind us. We are no real Sam and Dean either. Those are some boy that might have helped you by now. Your constant annoyance by asking 47 questions a day, sending nudes to adults\\me [You are a minor, we don't want to go to jail=Stop], asking personal questions, accusing as of lying and being the the caleb us, threatening, calling us names.. If you just cool down a bit I'd be cool with some of these, but there is a limit. Avoid most of those actions and you'll be less of a stalker.
