  Mr. Carbone taught me i could be smart and excel at school and made learning fun......we made buzzers to play Jeopardy with and learned about the Solar System too.  For a long time, i wanted to go up to Space, but physics and me did not get along.
  
   I went to Space Camp and Space Academy in Huntsville, Alabama.
   
    That was a cool adventures.
    
    Plus,he introduced me to The New Kids On The Block; Merry Merry Christmas Album.

  An Astronaut; I went to Space Camp and Space Academy
  
  I was taking classes to become a payload specialist; my mind could not comprehend Calculus.      Finding an abstract point in space, did not make sense to me
  
  So then I took classes in psychology and became an environmental teacher
  
  That recycling everything that can be recycled and teaching my students to do the same; take care of ""Mother Earth""
  
  I have inspired some of my students to become teachers; but I wouldn't be a teacher if it were not for Roco Carbonie and Jovan Hernandez and Mary Lee Danielson gave me confidence in math to achieve my BA degree

  answer questions as they come, be honest and then let the children keeping asking you questions, don't just have one big sex talk when puberty hits
  
  if you are going to teach the children names, teach them the proper names
