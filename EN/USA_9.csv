  All kinds of food. Their crab dressing is really good. They put it in... well.. what I call it... Chinese cornbread little things with a little shrimp on top and they put it in little shells too. Omgosh... So good.. Best thing there. It's a little butter real it'll greasy and it's so warm and crunchy. Shrimp. Egg rolls. Fired foods. Another good thing that they make as they sauteed vegetables down like green beans broccoli and carrots and that's really good. They're noodles and rice are really good you know the fried rice with eggs in it. That's really good. They make really good fish. It's got a little spice to it. But it's perfect. I love their fried zucchini. It's crunchy on the outside and it's just perfect in the middle. A little buttering. Frog legs. Little potato squares. Crawfish. Crab. You already know the basics. There's way way more. That's just some.

   Hi bella i was hoping you could give me some advice? My toxic  ex bf broke up with me 2 days before valentinesday but i still think about him, feel sad, miss him even tho its been a while? He was really toxic so we dont talk anymore. He was my first love. Will this feeling go away It bothers me alot
  ","
  Sometimes I still remember my first love. Long long ago. We were like peas and carrots. But like he was my first crush and he was kind of stuck up a little bit kind of like what you're saying and it always sticks with you because that's your first person that you love. That you enjoy being around. That you just love. So of course you're going to miss them, always. It's probably not going to go away. But you do have to move forward and forget people. Especially if they were toxic. You don't need those kinds of people in your life at all. Just think that things happen for the right reason. If you got rid of a toxic person. Whether you think it wasn't the right thing, it was. I would consider yourself lucky, honestly. Think that way.
  
  Sometimes your body can want things that it shouldn't. Sometimes you got to take a step back minute a minute... that you don't need it.... Sometimes you got to go with a gut feeling. If you feel that someone's toxic than that's a gut feeling. If you're having to ask me this question then you need to stay away from them.
  
  You want to end up with a person that you can stand. Not someone that's going to bring you down in the end. You want someone supportive on every levels. You should be serious about every relationship that you go into. Not think... Oh I miss them... You need to be serious. Because one day you could end up having kids with them and sometimes things happen on accident and you don't want that to be the person that you make an accident with. You want to make a family with someone that is trustworthy. That's going to be there for you. That's going to be faithful. Trustworthy. Honest. Hard-working. Sustainable.

  A hotdog or sausage tjat you take usually a sweet doe or croissant and wrap it around it in a spiral covering it. You can put a slice of cheddar in the middle or use cheese filled hotdogs. Those are really good for that. Juicy jumbos they call them. Then you put a little salt on them and cook them for... 15ish Minutes? 17? Until brown and cheese has melted. Can make mac and cheese with and black eye peas with too. Usually the sides with it and chilli. You can also do bacon ones... Boudin filled ones (Cajun rice), ham, hamburger ones, cheesy jalapeno and more.
  
  Pretty affordable.
  
  Just the dogs and chilli.
  
  Can be a 7 dollar dinner.
  
  If not cheaper and it's good.

  As far as going to haunted location, wintnessing the haunted history and learning the story's behind the places and discovering what happened there.

Everybody so wound up and wondering what everyone else is doing they're not focusing on themselves and what they should be doing. It's simple... It doesn't affect you.. It affects whoever the tattoonis on and that's it? I understand if maybe the tattoos jumped off someone's body and started making fun of you or some sh- like a human figure would do, buuuut crazy enough.. They don't do that so why stress? I don't get it? Tattoos are a picture? On someone? Art. People are like.. ""Oooh it's in the Bible,"" and this and that's okay.. Yes I know it's in there but the point in what I'm trying to make is.. It's that person's choosing to do what they want? They already know what your telling them?? So.. mind your own business? And you don't have to worrie about the tattoo.. Cause it's not on you. Cause that's them... Not you.. But they don't understand that. They don't perceive it as that... They feel like they have to teach them a lesson? Or make them feel bad or something? That they are doing something wrong. Going at something wrong? Like? Why stress so much?! Just mind. your. own life. and. not. others. ? Simple.

  It still doesn't matter. You shouldn't try to change him. Like trying to get him to go back the way he was. Cuz he may not want to do that. People change over time. And every single relationship. Someone could seem the same for five or six years and then change. Someone could see in the same for 25 years and then change. It's random. It's something you can't control. People change over time. But if you wants to do that and then... I mean? then work together with him to get healthier and work out. Both of y'all try to be heathly. It's good to be heathly. But if he is comfortable the way he is then don't change him. And you should love him for that also.

  ","
  In my opinion it shouldn't matter what person looks like physically. You should be loving him for his personality honestly... Because say if you were going to spend the rest of your life with someone... Anyone.. You're supposed to love them through sickness and health... And more.. So that means if he was to break his leg or developed sort of a disease where he literally became a stick or he got some kind of skin issue you're still supposed to love him, regularless. Abs or not. ? lol.. It shouldn't matter what he looks like?! You should still love him regardless! He's supposed to be your best friend! That's like you getting pregnant.. and he say that you're getting fat? And that he's losing attraction towards you?? That wouldn't be right because you can't help the fact that you get big when you're pregnant because that's how it works. Surprising enough? ...there's men that literally get angry and leave their woman because of that! even though that's how it works! LOL makes no absolute sense!
  
  But you're doing it all wrong. That's how relationships are supposed to be. You're supposed to love them for their physical and mental characteristics. Try to learn to love him for everything he is. And what it is.

  Henna, also known as Mehndi in Hindi, and Chinah in Hebrew, is a dye prepared from the plant Lawsonia inermis, also known as hina, the henna tree, the mignonette tree, and the Egyptian privet, the sole species of the genus Lawsonia.
  
  Henna can be many different colors. Blue, black, yellow, green, red, and brown. These colors usually.
  
  You may be familiar withhenna, a reddish-brown coloringmade froma flowering plant that grows in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Since the Bronze Age, people have used driedhenna, ground into a paste, to dye skin, hair, fingernails, leather, silk and wool.
  
  Every culture and region of the world useshenna tattoos in its own unique way. For Hindu weddings,hennais painted on the bride to symbolize joy, beauty, spiritual awakening and offering, while Moroccans often paint doors withhennato bring prosperity and chase away evil.
  
  A henna tattoois made with dye from the hennaplant. The tattoois often made with a specific amount of hennapowder mixed with other ingredients, such as water or tea.... Other techniques include a thin toothpick dipped in the dye and then drawn on the skin.

   When it comes to buying things, do you prefer to buy from name brands or generic brand? Or does it not make a difference?
  ","
  When it comes to food it depends. Sometimes it doesn't matter & sometimes it does. A good example is cheap cheese. It can really hurt your stomach & it also I find takes longer to melt & sometimes it doesn't even melt?! So sometimes I have to spend a little bit more one cheese, to get good results.
  
  I took an environmental science class & one of the chapters was on water & where it's from. What they do with it. What happens to it when it goes down the drain. Everything..
  
  Water is not just water. People are always say water is just water. If you go into the Gulf of Mexico & drink that water not only will be salty, but it is contaminated & is not good.
  
  Right now the Gulf of Mexico water is filled with brain eating, flesh eating bacteria. Even stepping in the water can be hazardous to you. If the bacteria gets into tissue it can become deadly.
  
  There's groundwater. Spring water... Water with minerals in it. Then they have water that they filter sometimes 2, 3, 4 & sometimes even more times... They filter it alot.
  
  Some water bottles...they just slap logos/labels on it & we believe what is inside of the bottle is fresh. But in reality we need to do our research on each type of water & where they get it from & safety of knowing what we're drinking.
  
  Some water bottles people don't store correctly & they get in the heat & the plastic melts into the water creating oils that are actually extremely contaminating for the body. Bad for animals even. Can cause cancer & more. If sometimes you drink out of a water bottle & it has a horrible taste that usually means that the water is bad! Throw it away! It is been stored in a warehouse in the wrong way and it's probably been exposed to the heat too long.
  
  But like water. It depends on where they get it from honestly because I heard Dasani water is not really that good for you because there's something in it that makes you really dehydrated regardless of drinking a lot of it and it's not good for you.
  
  Being aware manners.

   In that case, I will formulate the question differently: What do you think about people who are friends with a person but after a while they start to ignore that person?
  ","
  Well I know that when going to high school or college. Usually after studies and you graduate a lot of the friends that you had then... kind of separate. It's normal completely. This is what usually happens... I had tons of friends in school and I'm friends with only a few now really... Or really I only speak to them every now and again... Sometimes it's for the good? and sometimes it's for the bad? Sometimes people just get caught up in their lives and really.. it's nothing personal towards you. I still talk to the people that went separate from me and we're still friends but we don't really talk as much... If that makes any sense? It's sad, yes. Because you miss those good times. Good moments. It really does feel like they're ignoring you, but honestly there just getting caught up with life and growing up. So this is not always the case. It might not even be your situation exactly. But this is my experience with school and growing up. That's why they say... to enjoy life while you got it and when you're young. Because people move on and people grow up. New things happen in our lives everyday.

  But If you're asking is it okay to hang out with people at school and at work on vacation? Yeah I think that's okay.
  
  Unless you're asking is it okay to drop off the map almost went on vacation? And ignore everyone. That's okay too, because that's your vacation time.
  
  Sorry if this is not the right answers to your question. I just didn't really understand the question.

  Depends on the hotel. Some hotels will have life free spots to sit on the beach plus like firewood plus like free food. Some hotels are worth it because they have tons of free stuff or things that they provide for the stay that cheap hotels don't. But honest I don't really care where I stay as long as there's a bed everything is cleaned and it's safe.
  
  I usually like to stay at like three star hotels because they're right in the middle. I try to always make sure I check ratings before anything.

  When I go on vacation I want to experience things that I don't usually. Go to places that I haven't seen before. Try needs foods too. Make a challenge for myself. Like maybe walk few miles on the beach or hike to a destination. Camping is pretty challenging. Canoeing is challenging. Walking around, sand dune to sand dune, out in the water, at the beach is pretty challenging. Lazy Rivers may seem lazy, but when you're swimming around in circles really fast, it's not. ? It's fun and it's challenging and it's really good exercise. I enjoy making fires and barbecuing. Fishing, hunting and then eating the food. Preparing it and eating it and thanking for having the food.
  
  I like going to museums. I like getting a good night's rest too and relax at times also.

  Fall and winter the most peaceful times of the year for me. Though I would agree with you... fall can be a little sad. Some years.. It sees that people pass away in this time of the year? Idk.

But honestly the fall and winter season are quite peaceful for me.

  I mostly use Google Translate. I'm just very careful with how the wording is. Because in some languages some words are not the same..
  
  I just keep flipping the Translate until it fits. That's how you can check your language spelling for each language that you are trying to translate by just flipping the translate back and forth.
  
  It's really hard to explain in these words. I would have yo show you and you would totally understand. It's not easy what I do when trying to translate a language, but I do it anyway to talk to you all.

  Not talking about you... I'm saying they've got some people on here that I've seen stalk people to the max and telling someone that you own such expensive stuff. You'd be suprised... They don't need much information and they'll show up at your house. Tho they wouldn't even get in my yard and the dogs would eat them probably... They don't like intruders.. And country folk and even the neighbors don't like company in their or our yard... They wouldn't get far. But still. I rather be safe than sorry is the thing.
  
  I remember one guy.. He was saying that he was gonna go buy this really expensive car and that he was paying in all cash and stuff and was giving so many details. Well... on the way to his destination he was shot and killed on spot and had all his money stolen from him and he had a baby on the way...  was a good dude and everything. Was killed for his money. That was all. It just takes a little information. It's crazy.

I was in the top 25 for the longest, sometimes top 10 and never knew? I have been ln Ask for years. I never really got really into understanding how everything worked really. Ever. I guess over time I've been learning. People are informing me and helping me out with learning what everything is. How it works.
  
  Though I don't realpy care if I was even on the leaderboard at all because many of times I'm sure I never was. I am  focused on the people. Helping and talking with others on here.

And yes... like a fast food restaurants have greasy foods, but no like these chicken nuggets are disgustingly greasy... Like The Popeye's down in Louisiana is waaay better. But the thing that shocks me is all of the restaurants around here are absolutely delicious and they're good at making their food. I don't know if it's just the employees?? Who knows.
  
  There is one other restaurant around here that we don't usually go to and it's called crystals. We haven't been there in a couple years so maybe they have improved? I don't know but I know that I've heard some bad reviews on that place.

  A sauna is a sweat room... basically. You sit in it and relax and sweat. You don't really have to do much. It's like... a humidity room basically? Yeah. That. But usually high-end/risher folks usually own saunas, but I think that you could probably go to one and pay to stay alive or just sit in your bathroom with the water on high and just take long showers maybe? I don't know if this has the same equivalency.

  Anything alone... Not a good idea. Because you never know how people are... Don't bring them home the same day... You want to test action and mental thought with someone for the 1st date. Goes to show their thought process... How careful they are. If they are fast thinking... Creative... The things that you could be potentially interested in. Impress with something you are actually naturally good at. This is you being yourself. You can go to a restaurant... But like you should try to ask alot of questions... But don't get ugly or personal or out of order with them... Be respectful and expressive with your questions and answers. Be open. Especially open minded. Even for a man.. A little ego and tryna be sophisticated isn't bad... Your just tryna... Figure them out. Be spontaneous with the 1st date but smart. Make it something to remember... Because if it works out... You wanna have bomb ash story to tell your kids one day!

   When you go to the hair salon, how do you like your haircut? Layers or no layers?
  ","
  With my hair?
  
  I go about four and a half hours all the way out to the bottom south Louisiana to get it cut by someone special. I know exactly how I like my hair. Considering this is where I'm from and where I used to get my haircut. My hair is about 3 and 1/2 ft long almost. I get it styled and trimmed only when I go. Occasionally I get some short and long layers. It just depends on how it is growing. When I get these short and long layers it shapens my hair into the way I want it. When she cuts my hair she kind of puts a v into it into shaping.
  
  I do not get any bangs. I tried to make sure I take well care of my hair. I love having good hair. Let it grow and keep it healthy.
  
  Occasionally I get some colors in it but not a lot to keep it healthy. And I don't try to bleach it at all. I don't try to scorch it either.
  
  Usually if I get any type of colors in my hair. It's different types of reds, yellows and browns. For my Indian Heritage mostly.
  
  But yeah she knows exactly the way I like it cut. So really when I go in she just doesn't. She also razor cut certain ends. Has it very choppy. It's not no straight edge cut. Very old school. And she also Styles it really cool. Sometimes she'll curl it sometimes she'll straighten it it just depends. Going to the salon with me could take hours. But I only go a few times a year.

Not that serious. But I really think people could try things before not liking it. Because you could be potentially missing out on something really awesome!

  I'm also trying to text and call certain people to stay in touch with my grandmother and what is going on.
  
  I also have an unexpected trip to take in the next couple weeks so I'm going to be completely exhausted for the rest of September and October probably.
  
  I'm going to see her in 2 weeks possibly for the last time. So yeah things are tough... But it's definitely life... I just have you guys to talk to you! And I'm sorry if I share so much emotion on here is just because you guys are so awesome and I love y'all! You guys are so sweet to me! All of you! Thank you so much! Everyone! ?❤? For the support!

   In your opinion, can two people be friends if they have very different opinions and morals? Does it depend on what those views are? Where would you personally draw line?
  ","
  I think that people can be friends regardless of whatever is going on. Just because someone disagrees with you and doesn't have the same views doesn't mean you can't get along and be friends. Just avoid those certain types of conversations. Touchy conversations. And if you do have those conversations, respect each other's opinions and try not to argue. You can have a discussion / debate without getting in a fight. And be friends. I have tons of friends that don't have the same types of use as I do and we're still friends. I don't make my views that extremely important over theirs and they don't do that to me. So that makes you able to get along with him. We put our differences aside. Everybody deserves to have an opinion and have their own morals and Views. At the end of the day you need to respect one another. Think about it. Is this that important to argue about? That's the type of mentality you should have.

  The afterlight targets things that are helpless and feared to it. That is the negative part of the afterlife is.

   If you’re talking to someone and their always lying to you at what point do you just end the relationship but let them down easy
  ","
  If it's like small stuff that's not that big of a deal like... did you cut the grass? and they say no... maybe... & then you come home and it's not... that's not that serious.. for like did you wash the dishes  and they didn't... it's still not good to lie about things like this but these are small lies that you can bypass and talk it out... but if you're talkin about like them not telling you where they're going and they're just getting up and leaving the house or they are not coming home on time... you asked to see their phone and they won't let you... these are things that are important to tell your other half... if you have a problem with telling them then you must be hiding something. If they're doing that at all.. try to fix the situation and get them to communicate with you immediately. If not then there is a communication problem. That is serious lies in a relationship and usually means something bad. If they can't be honest with you then you don't need to be with them.

   What's caused these race problems? ?
  ","
  There was a cop that shot a civilian and he didn't need to shoot the fella and they were both different color.
  
  And then everybody made it into a race thing. Made it seem like all people we're racist when honestly it was just that one cop that messed up and he got in trouble for it. Them everybody just started saying all cops were bad. And thry aren't. Just one bad apple ruined it for all. People were being racist and stuff... People were killing other innocent people and cops... And there was alot of protesting everywhere. Was just horrible... :( Very sad... luckily it all stopped eventually. It's still around a little bit but it's not as bad as when it all started.
  "
49878,"
   If that happens again, get in touch with the police, they won't show much sympathy to anyone doing something like that ?

  For sure. There was a lot of stuff going on at the time when this happened so it was nothing really to me. There was a lot of stuff going on in Baton Rouge protests. Cops were getting shot at the time. There's a lot of shootings. A lot of race problem stuff going on. So is nothing really new to me.

  I mean sometimes they just don't want to be alone and they want someone to talk to you? I'm sure that might be what it is.. and of course then you have those few that are up to no good.
  
  I remember riding the bus one time... I had this guy taking pictures of me and the girl I was sitting with.. She was.. 20? I was 21? and I got very angry with him... I made it known... and told the bus driver and he went off on the guy and the bus driver almost threw him off the bus. He threatened to throw him off the bus and leave him on the side of the road. Because he knew I was telling the truth he could tell by the way I was telling him. I was very scared and upset. I felt very violated.
  
  As the man took the picture of a us I stood it up and I made it known to everyone on the bus that I was not playing around... then I took a picture of him and said, ""There! now we both have photos of eachother!"" Because I didn't know it was going to happen but I wanted evidence just in case. I felt responsible for the other girl. If he was going to try to hurt us he was not going to mess with her. I wasn't afraid of him. I was getting angry with him. He finally got the picture that I was gonna f-ck him up if he didn't leave is alone and shut up an went to sleep.

  I would just rather a small group of people together to clean the environment and get things out the water and pick up trash.
  
  With animals. Just be careful with the wildlife. Again pick up things that are dangerous and hazardous to them.
  
  Keep an eye out for the overpopulating, the endangered. Hunt safely. Hunt as needed and follow all the rules. Hunting can be good. A lot of people look at hunting as a bad thing. Yea? If you kill all of the species and over hunt, yes. But that's why they have Rangers in law enforcement in it. To keep track of people that are abusing the laws. Hunting can help the overpopulating species. The overpopulating of a species can be bad. It can make other species die out if there's too much of another, especially in one area.
  
  Take down unnecessary buildings that are abandoned. Certain buildings. To give room for wildlife. Keep planting trees. Cut down rotten and bad trees.

  Distance is no match for the ability of everlasting patience.
  
  Anything is possible. Obstacles are a thing. But as humans, we are capable of anything as long as we set our minds to it. Faith, learn it in something. A least in yourself. Control. Gain it over yourself.
  
  Look ahead. The path maybe long and hard, but there is always an end. A finishing line,  a destiny, a story awaiting, something to be taught,  repeated and learned to live.

  ","
  I was friends with someone for like 10 years and she decided to date some druggie and I don't hang out with people that do drugs... and like he was doing some bad stuff.
  
  Cause of you hang out with a druggie... then you end up doing drugs... Also he was treating her horrible. And his house space was gross.
  
  Not good for her at all. She ended up finding out I was right. He was cheating on her. And I don't know if she did drugs or not but I don't really want to find out. She knew he was bad. Literally. Why stay with someone like that? Dromt he start I told her and even before. I am not hang out with people that do drugs. Bad influence. If you see that someone is not good for you then why do it? Just because they like you?? It doesn't mean that they're good for you. This happened years ago. We were young. Being that young and hanging out with people that do drugs was not good. Still ain't now. Never.

   Why do some people stay in relationships that they know are toxic?
  ","
  Nowadays people feel like they have to be in a relationship always. Even if that means settling for the lowest or a rebound. Settling for a rebound can be wrong. You're meddling and not even being serious about being with the person. You're just there because there another person with you so you don't have to be alone. Don't settle for the lowest. Because you deserve better. I'd rather be alone than shoot for something low. Especially a piece of sh- that treats you like garbage, wants to be lazy sit around and do nothing and hits you. No.
  
  They feel that they can't go on with life being alone. You can. It is possible. We are independent individuals. We have control. And we should should all have confidence and ourselves.
  
  Toxic environments, toxic people and toxic relationships are not good for the mind and body, not good anyone or anything.
  
  Figure yourself out first before forcing yourself to be around someone that you don't need to be around.

  It's very rare when I blow dry my hair. If I have to go somewhere I will but even then I try to plan ahead to take a shower to give my hair enough time to dry naturally. But drying is not good for your hair. I'm trying to cut down on straightening my hair because that is not good for your hair either. Applying a lot of heat is not good. But if I need to dry my hair quickly I will blow dry it but carefully.
  
  I usually just wash my hair and let it dry naturally. I will put it in the town for just a few minutes so it won't be so I can wet and then I take it down out the towel and let it dry naturally.

  Because though I get aggravated with the same question over and over it's always someone different. If it was the same person then I would get really annoyed and probably blocked them if they didn't get the picture. Cuz then it's starting to turn into something disrespectful.
  
  Occasionally it's people that don't know English well, they can't really read biographies well and are just curious and don't really know any better it seems.
  
  I am flattered with the thought that somebody likes me. It's good to be liked. It's good to receive compliments. You just got to learn to take them. Compliments are good for the mind... your self-esteem and confidence...but I am honest with them at the start and let them know that I'm not interested in that way. Friendship is all.
  
  But I also thank them for the compliment. I try to make it into a positive like most things. Unless it's something life-threatening, I don't see a reason and getting upset over it. Sometimes aggravating yes but like I said I just tried to make it into a positive. Some of them don't like the rejection and get angry and those are the ones that I blocked, because if tell them in a un-rude way and tell them the  honest truth, then what's the problem? Why be rude and ugly? I don't get a lot of these though.. Considering I don't say it in a messed-up way I just simply post that picture usually of my bio.
  
  But you have to think also. Appreciate the fact that other person wasn't telling you the compliments in an inappropriate way because that's also annoying. There are boundaries of respect but that don't mean to be crossed. Especially with strangers.

   Some ideas to lose some weight?
Did you try any program for diet before?
Give me some advices if you can
#all
  ","
  Make a daily routine for you. Like wake up wash your face get ready for the day eat something small do a few things around the house and then go for a jog with a water bottle for like 2 mi. Jog to a destination turn around and come back. Going up and down hills is good exercise. Doing stretches every morning and at the end of your day is good for you. Yoga is good for you. Eating small meals and healthy meals. Portions are important. Get rid of bread in your diet almost completely. Get you a treadmill. Treadmills are not that much and work on a lot. Get you a few lb 5 lb 10 lb and 20 lb dumbbells, they aren't that much.
  
  Walk your dog three times a day.
  
  Showering twice a day is good for you. Changing your clothes regularly throughout the day is good for you. Getting 6 7 or 8 hours of sleep is good for you.
  
  Lessen your pork intake and red meat intake.

  Idfk... But like I cannot seem to make it anymore clearer to some of these people... And I be getting guys and girls?! ?
  
  And I don't mind the compliments, I mean I appreciate them.
  
  But the first thing that I think everyone should do is read people's bios. Not just go profile to profile and just ask people if they're single? It just shows desperation to me. (Even though this is not a dating site.) But... If you are interested in trying to find someone, why don't you try to make more effort in trying to find someone? So you don't always keep getting declined constantly. Does not help your confidence level at all either... Focus on you more than just going person to person to settle for the lowest.

  Sometimes it's just better to just go with life. Go with the flow.
  
  If you're standing around worrying about the past then you're not living life to the fullest? You're sitting around and stressing about the things that you think that you not quite made the right decision about?
  
  Why not just think about your decision beforehand and then make that decision. Be confident in what you did and the choice you made. We are smart independent human beings. We are capable of so much more then what we realize. Try and if you've tired... then you've tried to do the right thing. If you are good then you are good? Simple.

  ","
  I don't know. It depends. Does it still hurt? Because of the does there's tons of different remedies that you can do that you can look up online. Including one with gargling hydrogen peroxide, warm water, salt and mint mouthwash together. (GARGLE ONLY. DO NOT SWALLOW) Gargling that three to four times and then going lay down without eating or drinking for 3 minutes. Preferably go to sleep on that. What that hydrogen peroxide and those ingredients do they attack the acids that are hurting your throat and cause them to deteriorate and it causes a scab and makes sore throat shortened. But it depends if your throat is already raspy that means that you are past the hurting stages and don't need the hydrogen peroxide and those ingredients. At this point it seems that you have probably had a sinus drainage with the acids in your throat and you are now in the last stages of it you...
  
  If you do use the hydrogen peroxide you only a little bit. The warm water is for soothing. The salt is for drying which is what you want and the mint mouthwash is also for soothing and other reasons to help.
  
  Probably calling your doctor and asking for medication. I'm not sure what they're prescribed....probably steroids and/or allergy medicines. But I don't know exactly what you have and what stage you're in... But consulting with your doctor is probably the best thing for you to do.
  
  Also eating and drinking things that are sugary. Things that provide vitamin C. Staying hydrated. Lots of showers. The changing of your clothes daily are good for you when you are sick. Not sleeping in a room that is really hot. Make sure your AC filters in your house are cleaned/ changed or just make sure the air around you is cleaned.
  
  Another good help...
  
  Ricola cough drops. Chloraseptic spray. Warm tea, raw honey, lemon, little salt and a little whisky help.
  
  Warm tea, Lemon, honey again.
  
  Peppermints.
  
  Orange juice.
  
  And more.

   What do you think society has lost sight of these days? ?
  ","
  I think that people don't get out and do things anymore and socialize. They just stay at their house. People don't get out and go places anymore. Socializing is a very important thing for humans for animals for anyone.
  
  People are not disciplining their children at all. Just the other day I heard a little girl she was like six or seven or eight and she was cursing her mom out in the mom didn't even care she just let her.
  
  And this is just one account. And say nobody is disciplining their kids.. but no.. I will give credit to the people that still are! but around where I am at (living), it seems that they let their kids get away with a lot. Everything really... But then I see it on YouTube and these are people like me.. Cause I Upload and watch.. And I see it and a lot of other places... Only states.. Countries... More and more than I have ever... It's scary... I don't know if I'm just realizing it? But I just feel like it's getting worse as the days go?!
  "
50461,"
   If everyone carried a gun, would there be more or less shootings? ?
  ","
  Depends on the person carrying... I think that they should be careful with who they give a gun because some of these people are not mentally stable to have one. That is what I think is the sole reason to the shootings. They are poorly background checking these people. I mean even if they have even a slight problem wrong with them they should not be given a gun.
  
  Because I have seen somebody pull a knife on someone try to rob them and because somebody was concealed carrying they saved everyone's life in that building.. or at least the people that was around that lady. That guy with the knife, he put it down.. Out the miney down and everything and I think he started saying sorry and everything?! But he was about to kill people?! but if that guy wasn't carrying that day I think some of them people would have died.... But because that gun was put in the right hands he did the right thing. Saved lives...
  
  I think if people took more time out with distributing these guns to people.. so they could conceal carry them... then more lives wpuld be safe and  we would have less shootings. That's my answer.
  
  For a machine to work there has to be an operator. There has to be some sort of operator. Law of motion.
  
  People kill. People's choices...
  
  And the choice of giving a gun to a mentally unstable person can put lives at risk... Depending on what this issue is. But no matter what it is, they shouldn't be giving it anyway. Under any circumstance.

50464,"
   What would you change about society if you could? ?
  ","
  People need to stop thinking about themselves so much.
  
  Some people need to learn that change is a thing and it is impossible to stop it, so we need to just get over it and go with it. Just learn to adjust.
  
  Being judgmental is pointless and is a waste of time and just shows what kind've a person you are and is never a good thing that comes out of it.
  
  Get to know something or someone before jumping the gun.
  
  People need to spend more time outside and not inside.
  
  People need to realize underpopulation and overpopulation are both bad things and need to be regulated. With both people and animals.
  
  People need to know boundaries, also need to learn self-control.
  
  Some people need to realize that rules are different in different countries and  if they go to those countries they need to respect what happens there. (And I am talking about all countries, not just America. Some people go to other countries and get offended by how they dress. What they eat. Their government.)
  
  If you decide to go to Bangladesh. Then you need to respect and the people there and what they do.
  
  If you decide to go to Switzerland then you need to respect the people and what they do there.
  
  And same with any country.
  
  You need to respect their laws. You need to respect if they have curfews.
  
  This is a selfish type topic and discriminative topic I'm talking about. Closely related to the ones I already said above.
  
  I believe people should just accept. Be respectful.
  
  People need to understand that some people disagree with certain things and some people agree and that it's okay. Just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean you have to hate them.

   At what age do you believe a child should first start learning how to cook?
  ","
  Younger then the age 10. Watching is very important. Always watch and learn traditional techniques. When learn how to cook you want to grow into it. You want to be raised through it all.
  
  Little cooking with the microwave around the age of 8, 9 and 10? And watching and helping people with the ? dinner is good for learning.
  
  Go shopping with mom and dad. Ask ?'s
  
  13 little cooking like rice and noodles type things... Canned foods. Helping and watching alot.
  
  Also learning to bake is a good start. Baking takes a lot of reading. Exact of the directions. Adding just an ounce more or less of water can ruin a dish. Learning to read and follow the directions, learning techniques with cooking is very important when starting. As you grow into cooking you can ignore directions because you learn the techniques by heart. You can also twist the cooking and making it taste like something that is yours! By adding dashes and adding extra things. Maybe cooking it longer or less to have it a certain way. There are many different things that you can do to change a recipe.
  
  From the age of 13 to 16. Try to learn everything you can about the picking out, preparing, washing, how long to cook.. Meats. ??
  
  But cook with a partner that is very experienced. You do not want to undercook Meats. It can make you sick and also be fatal. Do you want to learn how to enhance flavors and be careful with your seasoning. When turning into the age of 18 you can try things by yourself. But make very certain that you know what you're doing if you're going to cook a meat. Same thing with fish and seafood. You want to make sure that you are meats are clean while preparing and cooking.
  
  ? Anybody can learn how to cook. It takes lots of practice. It takes patience. You want to want to cook. Try. There will be mistakes. There will be times where you ruin an entire meal. Don't get discouraged and learn from your mistakes and improve. As long as you haven't burn the place down... I think that you're good. ?

  Olive oil I definitely use for flavor. Vegetable oil for other uses.
  
  Butter
  
  Butter is good for making foods moist also and for soaking into foods to add flavor. Butter is good with baking and steaming and boiling foods. It is a good add with salty foods. Well with cheese and eggs. When making dishes. Butter is also good for working well with pots and pans. Helping with nonstick also just as oils are.
  
  Butter and oil have way more roles with cooking. This is just some.

  It's okay if you ever need me to help you just ask.
  
  North Carolina and South Carolina are on the eastern border also Georgia Florida and Virginia and that's where the hurricane waa going towards, all these areas, it kind of affected these areas with water rain and flooding hurricane surge also. Random in these areas.

  Yes! Cause I could focus! Cause noise I cannot. With quite I can! My mind cannot multitask. AKA can't hear more than one noise of time and do more than one thing at a time... when I'm reading in my head that's an action and I'm focusing on that I can't multitask a focus on the background noise and me reading at the same time.
  
  I honestly always thought it was pretty rude because I'm always quiet for them when they're taking their test why can't they do it for me.

   What are your top 10 favorite Disney movies it doesn't matter what order
  ","
  I don't know about favorite because it's so hard to pick just 10. I love so many of the Disney Channel movies.
  
  I can't remember a lot of the unanimated ones. But I'll just name a bunch of movies that are like throwing up off of Disney Channel.
  
  I loved the Cheetah Girls. The Even Stevens movie was the bomb Diggy. The Zenon movies were good. High School Musical was good. And then of course you got Beauty and the Beast. I love that moving. The Swan Princess is good. Aladdin is awesome. All The Lion King movies. The Aristocrats. Homeward Bound movies. The Beethoven movies were good. The original Cinderella Story the cartoon version. Then the Remake Cinderella stories. They were good. Our lips are sealed. I don't know if this movie counts but I love Forrest Gump. Halloweentown movies are probably some of my favorite. Hocus Pocus. Lilo & Stitch. Pocahontas. Moana. Twilight was my s*** growing up. The Air Bud movies. Heidi. And so many more. The Sandlot. This is just a few that I can think of at the moment. But I really liked watching.

   Are you still sleeping with the window open or are you too cold?
  ","
  It is not cold here at all. It is over a hundred degrees in the day and at night is 80 or 90. Open the window we would have bugs and animals get in because we live out in the middle of nowhere and it would be extremely hot. Plus the weather gets really bad here so we would have water in the house. I'm a cold natured person. So I like to have the AC on. I love the winter.

  That my most favorite thing in the world to do is to sing. I am very passionate about singing. I have been singing since I was about the age of 6 or 7 or younger. I love to sing. I have sang for many schools, events and parties. So much more. I hope to make a career out of it one day or something. I enjoy entertaining people. Making people happy and laugh. I enjoy seeing smiles on people's faces. If I can create those smiles, it means the world to me. People go through so much. They deserve that, at least. To try to be happy. To try to be cheered up. To have someone that actually cares about them whether they know them or not.

  People just hate change in general. Are scared sometimes too. People don't like remakes... And people don't like movies that are really good. They always got to make something bad out of something seeming so good. Always... Never fails.
  
  No one will ever be able to mimic the magical Disney Channel movies because they are legitimately unrealistic. The point of the remakes is to make them feel realistic to us and like open your mind up to it and visualize it yourself in real life. That's what I feel like the remix are for? And I appreciate that honestly? And that is what I get out of them. That's why I like them so much.
  
  People are trying to be creative. They're also trying to continue movies. People are running out of ideas. Shoot, at least they're trying?

   Definition of ego and attitude?
  ","
  EGO a person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance.
  
  The part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity.
  
  Yourego is your conscious mind, the part of your identity that you consider your ""self."" If you say someone has ""a bigego,"" then you are saying he is too full of himself.
  
  ____________________
  
  Attitude is a settled way of thinking or feeling about someone or something, typically one that is reflected in a person's behavior...a position of the body proper to or implying an action or mental state.
  
  To have an attitudeis a little difficult todefine... It is generally used tomean...that you behave somewhat arrogantly or disrespectfully. Do you have anattitude? When we hear that question we generally think of someone with a negative outlook on a particular topic, thing or person. This is witnessed all the time.

  More than likely. Yes. Sadly... And that.. Is not good for the environment. Overpopulation even with people can be damaging... And just as animals... The government looks at it as a problem. When an animal is over populated, what usually happens? They thin it out, hunt it or allow the certain species to be hunted more. Allowing more numbers in gathering per hunter.
  
  But with people, we don't exactly.. Do that? Because.. Well.. Lol were aren't food. At least I don't hope.

  Just be aware of your surroundings always. Be on top of bill payments, and organize events and just be careful with your money. Have savings just in case if things go wrong.
  
  Pick random times of the week to clean your entire area for a healthy environment. It's good to make habits of cleaning.
  
  To save money download apps for grocery stores and try to save money constantly even when you don't need to that way you can rack up any extra money! ?

  The only thing that kind of hurt was the light colors, but that's always. But it doesn't like excruciatingly hurt or anything. Nah. Like a sunburn.

   How much more does colored usually cost to depend on the size or how much color is used

  Depends on the type of work you gain. Depends on the tattoo artist. Depends on everything.
  
  Sometimes it doesn't even turn around color sometimes tattoo artists have a shop minimum. They will tell you before you get anything that they have a shop usually. Aka saying.. a shop is basically a price set before you get extra. Like. You pay the appointment fee. But not all the time this is true. But some places, yes. Like his is 80? I think or 40?
  
  Can't remember. And then if you get like a realy bug tattoo and its really hard and takes awhile and has alot of shading well then of course it will get more.
  
  Definitely just depends.

  I feel that I am aware of my surroundings more now? Yea. I think that's how we all get as we get older. We've realized more things in the world. Realism becomes something in our lives more as we get older. We realize that there are dangerous people in the world a lot more than what we thought. Or at least this is while I was growing up. I always thought all adults were Heroes. Because it's sad because they should be. That's how the world should be. But it is not.
  
  I feel that I understand things more. I have learned a lot of patience. I think it's a child I didn't have quite enough but now I feel like I have more than enough but it is good to have more than none or not enough.
  
  I have learned a lot in general growing up. My morals are thickening, becoming more wiser I feel. Slowly but surely I'm working on that.
  
  I am every day trying to improve on being a better person. I feel like we should all be like this every day of our lives until we lay down for good.

   The day that happened I was so angry and upset. I thought it was a fake article and to read it actually happened broke me. I used to watch her covers on Youtube all the time, she had an amazing voice that no one will forget. ❤️
  ","
  Yep. ?
  
  I have been following her for a long time.... She is definitely an idol of mine, an inspiration to me. She's a wonderful person. She is so sweet and kind. She has a magnificent voice. Adam Levine took very being interest in her also and was the one who paid for her funeral, Memorial. Everything I believe. I've been watching her grow from her YouTube channel all the way up to the voice and then she was doing that last performance before going on tour I believe? and then that happened at an open arms meet and greet... along aside the massive shooting the next day I believe...  the world chooses the wrong people to take out of it... She was not ready to go. She could have changed things with her level of kindness. She is one of the reasons why I am the way I am. Spreading kindness. Trying to spread the kindness that she wants to that she cannot no more... ? SO SAD. I still cry today.. Randomly sometimes. A real touchy heart breaking hard thing to talk about sometimes with a straight face... For me it's hard to talk about. I try to talk about it though because she deserves to be heard. Because she was a wonderful person and still is! ❤

  No it's fine to be a freshman. Everybody's a freshman once in their life. It's just another way of saying a grade. Like first grade second grade third grade, you're just in high school and is then. And they have the ""cool kids"" and the cool kids like to make fun of the new kids.... if you know what I mean? Kind of like a rookie? That's basically what a freshman is. There's nothing wrong with being a Freshman. There's just people that like to categorize it as something bad when it's not.

  In America, I don't know how it works and other places in the world, but in America you go to high school and there are four grades, 1st- Freshman then-sophomore than junior senior. Then when you graduate you go to college and you have freshman year again you have to talk more than Junior and then final senior but you can go longer and get more stuff in college. A freshman is your beginning year at that school.

   nice! would you mind posting your beignet recipe? always appreciate how other people do their thing in the kitchen.
  ","
  Beignets are simple. You can get the beignet mix online or at your local Walmart store depending on where you live.
  
  2 cups of the beignet mix that you use and then you put just 8 oz or however much you put into the cup and then you mash up and make you some dough.
  
  Then you use healthy amounts of flour to dry up the dough perfectly to roll out into a flat surface to how thick you want the beignets.  I don't make him extremely thick. I make the dough about a quarter of an inch thick.
  
  Then you cut out how ever big you want your beignets to be. I usually do mine about 4in long and 2in or 3in wide.
  
  You put about 2 and 1/2 inches of grease into a pan to let that get hot 1st and then put your Beignets in the grease (only 3 or 4 at a time. Do not crowd the fryer.) (Flip them half way) until they float and are a little brown. You don't even put them in there for more than 3 minutes. And they're done. Then get some powdered sugar and put it in a container. About a half a bag of powdered sugar and shake the Beignets in there and you're done. Then you have a crunchy juicy beignet covered in powdered sugar ready to eat. But eat them there now because they are hot and warm. You can continue to eat on Beignets for about 2 or 3 days after you make them but you have to microwave them to make them taste the same. Warm again!

  But I definitely hope this didn't upset you, me sharing this. This is what kind of have me a little down yesterday at the end of the night. This is why I'm scared to have kids sometimes. Idk what I would do if that was  happen to one of my kids. It would not be pretty for the other person.
  "
51446,"
   If you don't mind me asking, which photo was it that moved you to tears? ?
  ","
  Oh I don't even really specifically remember one recently but maybe a few of people growing up on me. Recently, a couple of my friends and family birthdays have passed. And some of the people are younger than me and just seeing them grow up, just lets me remember that life is moving and that I am growing also and I miss them as well. The people. The place is. The memories. They're all still here. It's just life is going to continue. And change.
  
  But also I saw a video that was sad. I don't know if that's exactly what you're looking for... but I feel that some videos move you to tears in good ways and bad ways.
  
  It was a horrible video. Some random lady just walked up to some couples kids and start stabbing them :( and the parents were trying to.. Like protector their kids and like stop the lady and the lady was trying to hurt them too... but was walking away??? after hurting the kids?? Only? like she just wanted to hurt them? I didn't really want to watch the video I just saw in the corner of my eye and thought it was horrible... I didn't understand but then then thought on it for awhile..
  
  But I don't care if she would have stabbed me... I would have beat the crap out of her... I just wish I could have been there...
  
  People nowadays think that some people shouldn't have kids... so I'm guessing that's why she did that to the children. To try to put them down. To try to express her hate towards certain groups of people. This is me assuming. Maybe she saw the couple and they weren't doing too well. Maybe seeming that they weren't raising the children right or something? Maybe they were on drugs? Maybe the kids were acting up and the parents weren't doing anything about it? Maybe that aggravated the woman in thinking...  some people shouldn't have kids because they're going to spread more of these kinds of people or something??
  
  I don't know. But regardless you do not do this to people. Children.. Does not matter what they do to you. But yeah.. ?...
  "
51447,"
   I've no idea what it's even like? ?
  ","
  I don't know...lol but ain't much to it I'm sure.
  
  The most the time when people ask for it it's because they want to hook up.. or talk to me about inappropriate stuff or sending nasty pictures. Just sick. And even if you are married they still want it!? And I'm like okay...you meddling homewrecker?... This is why people don't get married anymore or are married for even a year. Because people are constantly meddling into their relationships. And people are giving in. No self-control. It's pitiful.
  
  And I'm not interested in any of the above... so there's no point in having the app? Ya know? Pictures. ""Chatting.""
  
  The only thing I thought that was funny about the app was the funny features maybe? but there's so many creepy people it makes you not even want to have it.. So yeah....

And she couldn't hear very well I was trying to tell her that she had the wrong number and it took me like 15 times to tell her that. She felt bad and so sorry that she called the wrong number and I told her that it was okay

   Can you tell us about your tattoos
  ","
  I have 2.
  
  Want more tho.
  
  The first tattoo is a dreamcatcher of my life. It has an Indian feather for part of my Heritage. It has painting, a abstract look to it...paint splatter type look to it... And then there's a compass, for representing God's path for me in life and my direction. It has got a mysterious look to it, because you never know... life has its mysterious paths... also you never know what's going to happen when you take those paths... but you hope for the best. Life can be good, life can also be evil in ways and throw obstacles at you. It's up to you to try to learn how to get around them.
  
  I love this tattoo. It means a lot to me. It was my first tattoo and I nearly fell asleep getting it. It did not hurt at all. The only thing maybe thay hurt... Was after healing process, but a little bit, not much at all... the light colors. And not like OMGOSH IT HURT type pain. No. Like a sunburn for like a week. Then it inched for maybe a week. Oh! (Advice here) when you get a tattoo and it starts peeling and itching do not itch or peel tattoo or color will come out.
  
  The second tattoo is a tattoo of a diamond. ? It is also a matching tattoo of my better half. He has the same type of tattoo, but his is a gaint compared to me ❤ and he has got a big heart. ? So he gets the big diamond. ?
  
  Both of our tattoos have red and blue coming into purple. Him representing blue ? and me representing red ❤ and us coming together making purple representing us. ?
  
  We met in February and got together in April that is why is a diamond. The birthstone of our relationship. Also, a diamond is unbreakable and that is what we have always been. We were in a long distance relationship for four and a half years. Finding the distance between probably the hardest thing for me to do in my life. It taught me patience. Real trust. Loyalty. It taught me to remember that anything is possible.  I mean we literally completed one of the most impossible things people are always talking about.

  I work in an Associated grocery place. I've been in retail for about 10 years. I work in any department they need me. I sell things. I check people out. And more.

   Do you think it is better to be married and then live together or to live together, then get married?
  ","
  I mean...  when you get married.... you need to know for sure that you want to spend the rest your life with a person, so moving in for just a little bit or just staying for a little bit to get to know that person fully in their environment and where they live, so they can get used to you and how you do thigns and the same with them... You want to know how they are everyday. From the time they wake up in the morning, how they act aaaall the way till bed and maybe after a long day of work. This is a very important thing for marriage. But I don't think that you should fully move in with someone until you're married. You have to know each other to away. You have to make sure you can stand each other is a good way to put it. Haha.

  Just believe in yourself. Be yourself. Forget other people think of you. Go with the flow for the difference yourself. Hang with friends that want you to be yourself!
  
  And I know you're a really good person! And you beautiful!
  
  See! That's all you need right there! Now take that compliment and go with it! Believe it! Because it's true!
  
  The only reason why other people want to bring you down, cuz they're jealous of you, because you're doing better than them and because you're happier than them!
  
  You have to learn to give compliments and take compliments.
  
  Exercising makes people feel a lot better about themselves. It takes a lot of anxiety and worry away from people. Being productive and all helps. And you don't have to like... super duper exercise... no... just go for a walk? and talk with someone on the phone, go for a walk with somebody.
  
  Get you a gym membership and try to work your way up slowly. Working out is not just for your body and health. Fitness. It's for your mind. Helps build confidence.

   Is it ever acceptable for a partner to tell you who you should or shouldn't be friends with? Why/Why not?
  ","
  Depends on how they're going about it. Are they doing it because they're trying to be selfish and keep them to themselves? or are they trying to do it to keep you safe?
  
  Because if they're doing it to keep them to their selves, that is totally selfish, not right and can be really wrong for that other partner. You should be willing to let them socialize with anybody as long as that they're safe. Too much jealousy can break up any relationship. That type of jealousy will break up a relationship. It is a good thing for your partner to have social skills with lots of different people. (As long as they are doing an inappropriate manner. That is when relationship trust comes in) Learning to get good with socializing with many different people/groups is good for your incoming successful future. (For your family and upcoming life together.) Why would you want everyone to hate you and your partner? If you're keeping your partner from talking to other people than this is going to happen. You should want the best.

  I mean... You can be friends with your ex's.. but some. It depends on how they're acting after the relationship. It needs to be strictly just be friend zone at that point. If they're sitting there playing games with you, that is unhealthy for you to deal with such. It causes stress and it messes with your emotions. It is also a way of meddling and sometimes it's best to get away from those types of people so you can be happy.

   What is one stereotype about your country / people from your country that you think is NONSENSE? And what is another stereotype that you think is actually pretty true?
  ","
  See... People like to judge a country by the bad apples in it. This is with all countries. Not just my country..
  
  But for example... Like here in America, they keep saying guns kill people? But do theu realize a gun is not a human? It's not us? It is the actions behind the machine that kill people, not the item. No item. A lamp... A chair... A door isn't gonna hurt anyone unless force by something is put into it. A gun does not have organs? it does not breathe? it does not talk... it will not move until someone behind it operates it.
  
  I understand that some people are afraid of guns. That's completely understandable! Completely. They can be loud when someone is shooting it, but there are protecters in this country that know how to properly use them?.. And for the right reasons. Not just to kill or hurt someone... They are defending us. They are trying to keep you safe! To stop the bad shooters... We need good shooters. See now? It's all about who you give the gun to. People need to be more careful in who a let buy these guns! Because even if you try to get rid of the item, people are still gonna find a way. They do with other things that are banned and then what?

  Just mad that someone wanted talk to me.
  
  They I guess jumped the gun and got jealous. People can do that.
  
  I an naturally a person that alot of people talk to to get things off their chest and vent to, in a godo way. Inform me on things. The person that called me has actually been trying to call this person I am talking about for awhile and they are choosing to not answer their phone to them I guess? Forgetting? Idk? And this other person is alot older and seems to be mad thay this person is showing attention to me.
  
  In no way whats'so'ever am I trying to make them feel left out. I would never want anyone to feel this way..
  
  But this person is choosing to keep things to themselves I guess. That is not good. Because then this.. inwhich happened to me.. They will take their anger out on.
  
  They didn't hurt me. No.
  
  But they sure jumped to consultations and yelled at me for no reason. Completely uncalled for.
  
  They are old. There is nothing you can realy do about it.

  I am not much of a bleeder too when it comes to my tattoos! So I don't have to worry about that!
  
  But I love giving blood because I feel like I am saving lives. I was rewarded bracelets and shirts and everything for donating blood.

   I need some help from you please are you willing to help me.... because my friend just dumb me for no reasons and I'm asking also and didn't reply anything... what can I do cause I just didn't want to lose my friend...
  ","
  Let them know how you feel love.. If they don't show any attention or care then there's nothing much you can do... You need to move forward. Sometimes that's how it happens. If they aren't showing that they care then you shouldn't hang around. You deserve to be happy. You don't deserve to be sad.
  
  These are the situations that will make your stronger and learn.
  
  Don't linger on something too long. Because you could be feeding them what they want. They may want to see you like this and that is not right. That's wrong and sad. Move forward and even sometimes that makes them come crawling back even?? When they see you doing better then them?? But don't immediately go back to them. Give it time, dormant to see if they are actually being true what their feelings or if they're trying to play games. If they're trying to play games they will move on quickly. If they're not trying to play games they will wait around for a while. That's when they see you doing better than them and they see you in a different relationship or even by yourself. It's okay to be alone. You don't always have to be with someone else. Confidence. And dependency. You.
  
  Figure you out.

   What's the difference between girl pushups and that of guys?
  ","
  Girl push ups are knees on the floor and guy push ups are not on the floor.
  
  In school, around here, they always allowed the girls to have their knees kinda cruching them on the floor. They were still a tad challenging but a tad easier for girls so they could get threw. Also not hurt themselves as bad. Kinda a gentlemen thing to allow around here for girls.
  
  I can do both.
  
  Anyone can do a girl pushup.
  
  Real push ups are the challenge.
  
  I'm slowly going back into regular work out, so I am tryna' keep it easy atm for starting off. I had taking a break from working out for awhile and am starting to get back into it now. And tryna eat a but healthier. At times of the year I do this for myself and it's that time of the year for me to. I enjoy doing it too. Good for stress.

I just don't get it? Me? I try very hard to make sure that people feel comfortable around me when I'm talking and if not? I apologize and let them know that was not my intention..

  Yes and no. He was being.. What it seemed nice but I was slightly mistaken...he was a guy that was creepy to me once awhile back and I had just forgotten. I wanted to stand clear and away from him but as I said.. I forgot what his face looked like and he had said something nice this time and I thought he was one of my nice customer's so I went to hug him to be nice and kinda thank him for the kind worda cause I think I was having a but of a rough day. This happened months ago. Him, instead of just slightly and normally hugging me. He pushed me onto him too close and I did NOT like that. I kinda then shoved him off of me kinda hurried off towards my guy co-workers and they about beat him up if they weren't on the clock. The scary thing was? I never saw him again after this day. I bet ya he went to jail soon after that for something similar or he disappeared from the area because he wasn't from the area and he possibly could have been preying on me? I really hope it's not the second assumption. I shouldn't assume. But it's just kind of rather odd that I haven't seen him ever again. Though it's kind of a relief. I did not like that man. He definitely violated my personal space... Overly.. and he could have gotten in trouble with the law honestly.

We were in a long distance relationship for four and a half years and then finally got it to end and got married. We're better than ever and perfect together. He is very good to me. It's quite possible to meet someone online and click with them. Be very careful though with meeting people online. And lust is less, temporarily. Lust is mostly physical.. love is permanent and is more.

  It's a disability that never really gets easy or harder. Usually just sticks around regularless of anything helping.
  
  I work with it tho. It's quite common. It's just affects people differently sometimes works sometimes better. Back when I was first diagnosed with it there wasn't many people being tested for it.
  
  My dad got tested for it and found out that he had it later on in his life and that's where I'm got it from I guess.

  I'm totally capable of doing things, it's just growing up I had a lot of complications with learning. I was bit slower with getting things. My understanding. My way of thinking is completely different than a lot of other people's. I'm still kind of like that but not as bad.
  
  I try my best.
  
  Words appear backwards to me. Sometimes it's hard for me to remember how to spell things. I'm not very good at writing and thinking at the same time. Basically I'm not the greatest at multitasking. I'm better when I'm just doing one thing at a time. I could not take tests in the classroom with people talking. I had to have total silence for me to be able to concentrate.

  I mean with dating sites you need to get to know people before meeting them, that is what I mean, that's how every single site goes, not just dating sites, any type of site that you go on that has to do with the internet and you're not sure if what they're telling you is 100% factual
  
  Constant communication and speaking with them and knowing all their family members talking to them alone no one where they live and what's in their house how they live if they're clean
  
  It supposed to trust each other. You take it little by little slow and if they're not patient then obviously they're not the one for you and they don't care about how comfortable you are you can't force someone want to be with you

   So what are the flames on here, points or coins? What do they do? 
Do you pay attention to those?
  ","
  ? are points that get you up on the leaderboard in your selected country.
  
  I didn't know what it was for years.. I didn't pay attention to it at all. Didn't know what it was & then someone had to explain to me that I was high up on the board & that I had rank. I didn't know what any of this was? I was up high on the leaderboard & didn't even know it.
  
  I have had people tell me, ask me how I do it? I say.. Like I always have? I just talk to these people. That's what I do. Talk to them & listen. Ask questions & answer them. I try to be kind & help. Be there for people.
  
  But yeah. Per day you get, I think 2,000 coins from ask? At whatever time you start using them, then 24 hours later, the next day, at the same time, they renew. You lose whatever ya didn't use & it restarts. You get 2,000 again from ask. You can give them out to whoever you choose from any country. Doesn't matter. What matters is how well they answer the questions. You like the answer, you give them however much fire you want. But keep track of your ? fire cause once you use all 2,000 fire then ask site will then tell you that you have reached your coin/fire limit for the day.
  
  Your ? will add up for the day, week & as the day & week progressive your coins will go away that have been given to you. You have to keep up regularly with what you make daily & weekly. You can look at that under your coin/? tab. It will have the green ""+"" or the red ""-"". You can get fire from other users on here. If they like your answers, they can reward you. (Study for the next week or two & you will see what I mean. Under your coin tab.)
  
  We can reward you & you can reward others with fire.
  
  I still don't really make a big deal with likes & coins or rank. I just do me. I have never asked for anything off of here. Never have I asked for fire or likes or questions. I don't beg or anything. They are just given to me from what I do & I appreciate it all! Thanks yall! ❤ That's how it should be. Honesty goes a long way.

   Do ghosts and spirits of our deceased loved ones exist, or are they only mental projections?
  ","
  Me, I have researched the Paranormal for over 10 to 13 years. It's quite possible for people to have mental projections. But the paranormal, though I respect other people's opinions, S
  
  skeptics. But in my research over the years and what I have experience personally from the spiritual world is that paranormal, ghosts do exist. Both negative and positive energies. Both humanely, and then there is non-humanely ceatures, is what I would call it, they exist. The dominic side to the paranormal. Is it 100% fact, no, the theories, no. Though I don't argue with people that just simply get angry at me for what I do. I don't know them and they don't know me and what I do. What I have seen, heard.... I mean. You never know? Anything is possible in this world. This world is crazy.
  
  But I will tell ya... I don't think I would have been on this subject, studying the paranormal, the spirit world as long as I have if it wasn't somewhat a thought, something real.

   How much is to much to drink in one sitting
  ","
  Are you meaning when ya go to a bar? Just sitting there for like just 3 hours? Drinking continuously? Depends on the person behind the bar and it depends on the person that sitting there drinking. Some people drink more than others. Some bartenders offer more than others. Some bartenders say no when too much is to much.
  
  Me? I don't really go to bars anymore but when I did, I did not drink till I got drunk. I just drink and to have fun and I enjoy the drinks. I would usually order one or two beers and then I would order a few mixed drinks and a few shots. (Not enough to get me gone, no.) And usually other people would pay for my drinks for some reason, which was appreciated and nice and they I did not have to do. But yeah. I usually went to older bars to. There's less trouble. There is good music of all kinds. There was karaoke at this one. And I knew everybody. I enjoy listening to the conversations they had. They had pool.
  
  I used to bartend a few weddings. I enjoyed that.
  
  Another thing I would like to order at the bar was they would freeze mind glass and they would put ice and a few shots of Apple crown. That was probably my favorite thing to order.

  I yelled to my Maw maw as I watched the man get back into his truck.... I told her.. ""Maw maw! He was gonna take me! He was trying to take me! That man!"" And she asked what man and where was he? And I told in the front. I was playing on the trailer and this man in a white truck had pulled up."" And she told em not to play in the front yard noo more... To only play on the back patio and I didn't argue! I was terrified I told her yes ma'am. I think I told my mom about it and everything and those following few years they had warnings for all kinds of sex offenders down a few roads from my Maw maw's. Idk why he wanted to take me... But all I know is... There is no way that wasn't that man's intention... And that day I was a real lucky duck...

  We had just had a big crawfish deal(event) or we were about to and I think he left his crawfish trailer at my Maw maw's in the front yard and so I eas playing on it. It looked like a jungle gym. Was balancing on it and humming around and playing like an 8 year old child would and then has I was playing I had noticed this white truck come by and it didn't look familiar.. I didn't think.. And as it passed I didn't think anything of it. The fella in the truck had waved and kept going. Down here in the south it is quite usual for people even when you don't know them to ? wave. That's not out of the ordinary or anything... no. He waved and keep going and I kept playing, ignored it for a second. And then when I guess I turned around to balance the other way on the trailer I had noticed he only went down just a few houses. Like 4 or 5 and then parked to turn around. I then was stopped and observing why he could've been doing that?? I didn't understand. Kinda kept playing for a second and then he started to drive back in my direction down our road and then stopped infront of our yard and only pulled over just a bit. I think he even left his door open as he came out of it. I had jumped down already and as he came at me I exclaimed, ""What do you want?"", to him... and at the the same time ad me asking that out loud really loud he came at me and I turned around and was darting back uo out stairs and into my Maw Maw's house and as I opened the door yelled to my Maw maw terrified... I was absolutely terrified. I turned around expecting him to come in the door or knock or just something because I... (Will continue next answer on page.)

There is a beach there that looks exactly like Grand Theft Auto, it's based off of the game and it's call the Venice Beach and I want to go there with my husband and just walk around and just soak it all in. Then go to the beach and maybe a few destinations. I would not recommend going to any beaches and the south, in the Gulf right now because there is a flesh eating bacteria in the water and there's no reason to go and swim in South right now. Though there many places that you can visit and there's also pools. And the food is absolutely delicious.
  
  But yeah I would definitely pick California. I also want to visit Alcatraz and the Queen Mary while I'm there.

   Why is it so important to you to have a partner?
  ","
  It really isn't. I mean I just want a family and to grow in family.
  
  I never said that it is so important to have a partner. I just said when I was young I just hoped that I'd find someone. But the reasoning in is so I can make a family. I want to raise kids. And to do that you need another and honestly the genes come from them too, so you want someone smart and capable.
  
  When growing up I was in relationships and I was single for years it wasn't really a must have growing up I just I knew that's what I wanted was to make a family one day.
  
  I had tons of people try to ask me out and I just didn't choose them because they were just... Not for me and I just wanted to figure myself out and I was young. Live your life while your young.
  
  Maybe I shouldn't have said that that was the reason on what I was focused on growing up because honestly that wasn't really the right answer. I mean growing up I just wanted to try to be a better person. Improve and just learn.
  
  I unexpectedly met Jason, my husband. Wasn't even trying.
  
  But now that I'm with him I appreciate him a lot I've been with him for 6 years. So. Lol I'm used to him and used to being with him. Enjoy his company.

  You can have love and lust separately, or they can occur together. Lust is a biological state; it's your brain responding to hormones that your body is creating. Lust is what drives the desire for sexual relations.

  Mardi Gras' is around the Baton Rouge area and New Orleans. But be careful with little ones. It gets a bit crazy and crowded during Mardi Gras'. Maybe stick with a group of people from around that area to keep safe and not lost.
  
  There are a ton of awesome museums in Louisiana to visit. The New Orleans Zoo the Insectarium, and the aquarium are absolutely amazing in New Orleans. There are a lot of awesome World War museums in Baton Rouge Louisiana. There are tons of festivals and fairs throughout Louisiana all year round. There are many kids museums and science museums also. They're plenty of parks. Water parks and amusement parks. I do not recommend going to the beach in the Gulf considering there are bad bacteria is now in the water that can be life-threatening.  I have a few friends suffering from them.
  
  Christmas is really nice and Louisiana also.
  
  Chattanooga is a great place to go to that is around the Tennessee area.
  
  There is an awesome Bass Pro Shops in Tennessee and a Missouri and Louisiana.
  
  Yogi Bear, Jellystone National Park, is a good place to take kids in Louisiana and Mississippi.

  Through positivity. I try to find Hobbies. Try to stay soical. Traveling helps alot. Adventure. Learning to relax and going with the flow. Make new influencing friends. Paint even if you aren't good at it. Do good deeds randomly and don't expect anything in return. Learn to cry and learn to know that it is okay to do so. Happiness isdknowing that you are still alive today. That's all you need. That ya woke up that day.

   What do you think separates infatuation from 'real' love?
  ","
  Infatuation is a moment of getting carried away by a toxic and addictive love, and it usually happens at the start of a relationship while the sexual attraction is strong. On the other hand, love is feeling a strong sense of affection for someone else. Love is more of an emotion.
  
  Infatuation is very like lust. Goes away.
  
  When love is always and is serious and is always there. Unconditional. Wonderful. And the feel is almost impossible to live without. This is how I feel with my husband. He is my best friend. I couldn't live without him.

  "
52985,"
   How much do you think heartbreak  changes a person? for better or worse.
  ","
  I feel for the better. But then again it depends on what type of relationships and how many a person is deciding to go in and out of because some people don't even take relationships seriously. They just want to be with someone, because they just don't want to be alone and it doesn't even matter who it is. People are losing self respect for themselves. People are not taking marriage seriously anymore, because people are not trying anymore with relationships. People aren't even sure if they're ready to get married. Some of them just get married? If you get married... you know for sure if you want to get married to that person. At least in my opinion.
  
  If you are unsure then you are clearly not ready for marriage and with that person at the moment... You have your whole life ahead of you, take your time, and if that person is being impatient and is hurrying you?... than they obviously don't care enough to give you time to think.... If they loved you.. They would be patient and wait! No matter how long. Honestly I feel like that's the best way to find out  if you need to be with them or not . If someone doesn't have patience?... that's a big problem in a relationship.
  
  Sometimes they want to say.. ""oh you don't love me,"" ""you're not serious about me."" It's not that... you have to give a human time to get to know you fully.. 100 and thousand percent! They have to live with you! You have to make all decisions together... Constant communication! Loyalty! Trust! You've gotta be for sure.
  
  Idk. There's alot missing from society/this world, nowadays, I feel.

  "
53000,"
   Well, you know how humans have deep questions about purpose and what happens after death, then sometimes people have a spiritual belief that helps them cope with such questions
  ","
  If you are talking about religion. No disrespect here , I just prefer to not answer questions on that.
  
  Religion belief or non-belief is a sensitive subject in the world and is totally based off of views and opinions. People usually will have to pick side to one and I prefer to keep my views to myself so people don't side me with one  specific type/group of people.
  
  Hard to explain.
  
  I keep my religious views to myself in respect to other people that don't have the same views.

  Me and my husband were in a long distance relationship for about four and a half.. to about five years before we finally put it to an end with the distance. Me and him met way back in 2014. We met completely and utterly unexpected on Xbox 360?, on a game called Grand Theft Auto V.
  
  I thank that day that I met him! Because he is absolutely wonderful!
  
  Me and him had to wait 12 to 13 months at a time to see each other because of the distance. It was really rough. We really had to learn patience.
  
  Me and him have always had constant communication and would always get on Skype. We knew absolutely everything about one another. Our families loved each other! Me and him are definitely best friends. Now we are together and inseparable. ??❤? Married and wouldn't know what to do without him!

  It's probably been hours once... but I don't remember what for.
  
  But I know one time I waited 45 minutes to get into a restaurant and then waited an additional 5 minutes for another chair because they were that fact that they were literally out of chairs. But I'm going to tell you right now... that I was the best dang food I've ever tasted in my life and was totally worth it. Plus the place was extremely entertaining and there was lots of things to look at in to do while waiting. Though it seemed kinda expensive, again, it was really good food and service.
  
  The name of this restaurant is H2O located in Florida Pensacola.
  
  The person we were with can't really eat out a lot because they are literally allergic to almost everything... :( and they even cater to them! Even though they were packed to the T! they literally had the chef bring them their food and explain to them every single ingredient in it to make then feel comfortable with eating their food with their allergies! Such a wonderful place!

  These are Beignets,a pastry made from deep-fried dough, much like a doughnut, (but you don't cook it as long and brown and a doughnut...) and then dusted with a liberal coating of powdered sugar.
  
  The official state doughnut of Louisiana.They have deep affiliation with New Orleans and they have lot's to do with Mardi Gras celebrations down in South Louisiana. Made usually around this time of the year.
  
  I just randomly decided to make them today for my husband. He loves them and hasn't been feeling the best lately until today! He is feeling alot better! So I decided to make him a treat! And he helped too and he loved them!
  
  Bless his sweet heart. ❤☺

  Alls good. ?

   So what were they filled with?
  ","
  Nothing. They are beignets.
  
  I mean... You can fill them with stuff? but again they will get real soggy. Beignets are just fried warm pastries with powdered sugar on top they are crunchy and a little juicy when hot, but after that you have to heat them up again after to try to get the same effect.
  
  A Southen Cajun food made down in South Louisiana. Traditional. Love them. Go deep into my family with this food. My momma used to make them for me when ai a little tot. Miss that. Always were better when she made them. But that's all things momma's make. Haha. Even grits seem to taste better when momma makes them! Hahaha

  Yes. I have.
  
  The doll originally belonged to Robert Eugene Otto.. He is an artist.  The doll was manufactured somewhere in Germany, purchased by Otto's grandfather while on a trip to Germany in the early 1900's, and given to young Otto as a birthday gift. The doll's is in a sailor suit because Otto used to like to dress up as that as a kid. Haha.
  
  Otto died in 1974. His wife died two years later. After their deaths, the doll was sold to Myrtle Reuter, who owned it for 20 years... Then in 1994, the doll was donated to theEast Martello Museumin Key West, Florida, where Otto and his family were originally from. This place is now really popular to visit.
  
  My favorite Youtuber, OmgoshTV has an exact replica and it is extremely haunted too. The doll.
  
  Then I have wanted him stay at this stay at hotel/museum. The video is crazy.

  I love both honestly.. Had both of those dishes in the photo. Tired a littpe of both and they were so good... we were at a grand opening... they were letting us try everything.
  
  But Hibachi if I want choices because with Hibachi there's so different flavors on the plate.
  
  Sushi for do something different and new to try.
  
  Out of both of the dishes there... the Hibachi tasted better. The sushi was okay. Good.

  Remember when the gulf spill happened? well... the water is contaminated. Been. But they made it worse... because they put a bacteria in the water to try to break down the oil.. and instead it made a really bad skin/brain eating bacteria.... If this bacteria gets in your bloodstream... it can kill you. And this girl just has it on her skin and it was not healing but just recently started trying to get better. Scary but I think she will be okay. If anyone that you know gets this flesh eating bacteria immediately go to a specialist. Go to the ER and ask for a specialist because the sooner you get it taken care of the better.

  No it's not wrong to like them and they're in another relationship, but don't bother them in the relationship because then that's meddle and that's wrong.
  
  It's okay to have a crush on someone that is in a relationship with someone else. I have ran into this problem myself in the past but I did not meddle with their relationship. Just give their relationship time. If it works out, then it was meant to be between them and not with you... sadly.... Go with the flow. Don't try to make things work. They will naturally fall into place inwhich they are meant to be. The events in your life... is what I mean.

  Not allow people to get guns if they are clearly not stable enough to have them.
  
  Because obviously this person had something wrong with them if they're going to go walk up in the store and kill a bunch of people for more than likely over something so small going off in their household... To take their anger out and end innocent lives. People don't have control... Aren't raised with morals anyone. What's rigut from wrong. People just seem to not guve a sh-t anymore.. And it's pitiful.
  
  Plus people that ARE sane enough to have guns and know their rights should conceal carry more so they could have possibly saved these innocent lives. I myself know my rights as an American and know how to properly defend myself with a weapon (gun, taser, knife) and I would have tried my very best to keep these people safe if I would have been in the vicinity. Alot of people would agree with me...
  
  It's people being gullible and believing everything everyone says and therefore people just want that paycheck? and just go ahead and sell a to anybody regardless of their state of mind. It's just sad.

   Awesome. Favorite sports
  ","
  Thanks.
  
  This is the list from most favorite to still favorite and still have played before.
  
  #1 and favorite, Volleyball
  
  Played for 7 to 8 years and was team captain for a a few years before graduation. Almost went professional before my leg injury that left me no choice but to really sit out. Plus! I needed to focus on my school work!
  
  #2. Soccer. Played when I was real young growing up. Absolutely loved playing this sport! Definitely my 2nd favorite. Played for about 3 or 4 years. More or less. Enjoyed alot. Was sweeper and goalie best at.
  
  #3 baseball/softball
  
  Played for about 3 to 4 years.. Maybe more? Can't remember much. My mom was the coach for a few years. I played right fielder, then catcher for a few years and then gave pitching a try my last year and then quit. I enjoyed playing but was not something I wanted to continue. Still enjoy teaching and playing with side teams!
  
  #4 Basketball. Was decently good at. Really enjoyed playing! Good at shooting 2 pointers and played good block under the goal. I could steal a ball easy. I'd push on people and steal. But this sport is sadly the one tjat messed me up. Hurt my leg very bad and was rushed to the ER. Hurt it after too much because of this other accident and they said if I kept her in my life I would have to get a very expensive surgery that would put me out for year so.. And then expensive after physical therapy. Thousands and thousands and I mean alot of money was on the line or I could just stop. I chose to stop. Didn't want to further ruin my leg. Till today, I still struggle with my hurt leg. May need the surgery anyway sadly....
  
  Lastly. This wasn't a sport that I fully went into, but was begged to join and that is the weightlifting team. He wanted me because he saw potential. And yes I could lift a lot and I still can. I enjoyed lifting because I felt like it was a challenge & it also is healthy for you. It also gave me a chance to work with my hurt leg. Try to make it stronger.
  
  Think that's it. Ha

   In El Paso Texas, at a Wal-mart, someone shot and killed 20 people, and injured 26. Why, would anyone, do something this sick?  What is wrong with this world?  This is not a rare occurrence. Does anyone know, what would make someone do such a thing?
  ","
  Yeah.. I heard about it. It's terrible. Sad. People just are getting insane. Acting like they have no control? We are people. We have it. Just gotta find it in us. No excuses.
  
  It's sad. Very.

   How do successful people differ from unsuccessful ones?
  ","
  Unsuccessful people you can tell don't really have sh-t and things aren't as easy going for them.
  
  But at the same time I mean anything is possible I've seen people come out of high school sophomore year not graduating and have became successful.
  
  So I mean success can be really small to someone but yet so big as someone else.
  "
53601,"
   What you planning to research next? ?
  ","
  Well I have my regular stuff I look up all the time.
  
  My main is different levels behind the paranormal. Sometimes I even go on expirations. Wish ya could come! They aren't always scary and serious sometimes they are funny and fun. Quite spontaneous, adventures.
  
  Geography and culture is another I favor.
  
  Looking up different/secluded places. Places that are thousands of years old that people don't visit and learn the history and the culture of it. I like to research different biomes. Rocks. But I also like to research the food and how they prepared in different countries just different types of things that are done all over the world that's why I like this app so much. Because I can talk to people and they tell me all kinds of stuff about their country. It is so interesting and I kind of find it slightly respectful because I enjoy listening and it interest me so much. I show so much love when them telling me because they don't have to tell me? But I really love it and appreciate it alot. ??
  
  Then Meteorology.
  
  When was going college, this was my chose major and then my secondary was going to be geography that's why I like researching these two so much. I love learning about natural disasters, the process that you have to do to get in and out of them the science behind it all..
  
  All good.
  
  Other things I like too.
  
  But these are y favorite.

  To see that we are all humans. All one thing in common. We are human. No matter who you are, where we're from, the color of our skin, our views, how old we are, man or woman, we are all human. Get over it.
  
  People are always getting mad of such small differences and wanna be judgmental towards others. Well ya can't be that judgemental, cause ya wanna know something? ya a little like them, HUMAN. FACE IT. Embrace it. Get over it.

  ""Creole"" can mean anything from individuals born in New Orleans with French and Spanish ancestry to those who descended from African/Caribbean/French/Spanish heritage.
  
  Creoles in New Orleans have played an important part in the culture of the city. Creoles, like Cajuns, have contributed so much to New Orleans art, music and social life; without them, New Orleans wouldn't be the unique city it is today.
  "
53614,"
   Do forgive me if I'm wrong, didn't the Cajuns come from Canada originally? ?
  ","
  Yes.
  
  Cajun but more or less Creole in my family.. I have a French background though. My folks and surrounding folks are from the Bayous and New Orleans and I do have folks in France and I have background of French.
  
  But yes.. Information bellow on it...
  
  Cajuns are the French colonists who settled the Canadian maritime provinces (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) in the 1600s. The settlers named their region ""Acadia,"" and were known as Acadians. In 1713, the British took over Canada and expected all settlers, including the Acadians, to defend the kingdom. The British demanded that the Acadians adopt the king's Protestant religion.
  
  Over the next forty years, the Acadians' refusal to abdicate became a political and religious threat. The British government seized farms, burned villages, and expelled Acadian families. Families were separated as British soldiers loaded them onto ships with different destinations. Family members were shipped all over from New York to the West Indies. Some were sent down south to the Louisiana territories. Many Acadians found some acceptance in Louisiana, with its strong French background and Catholic heritage. Many family members were reunited there as they sought to locate one another.
  
  It is here the Acadians eventually became known as ""Cajuns."" Cajuns developed their own distinct lifestyle in the swamps and surrounding areas of South Louisiana. Cajun contributions to New Orleans and Louisiana are immense, and have improved the quality of life we now enjoy.
  
  Many people think we have a Brooklyn accent when we speak. It is my opinion that the Acadians who settled along the U.S. eastern seaboard are responsible for that ""New York/Brooklyn"" speech!

   What's the difference between talking on whatsapp and talking on other social apps like FB, Insta, SC etc..
  ","
  Idk? None? Lol.
  
  Probably caue with Facebook there is usually more information with where people are located and some people don't feel comfortable with adding and talking with people on there.
  
  But the other apps. I don't lnow nothing about the wasup app thing
  
  And other apps it's just less information given out. I mean you don't have ti give Facebook or any app your information but I find more people tend to put everythin lg out there on Facebook now'a'days so it's almost like apart of them. Home. Hard to explain.

   If You Could Write One New Law That Everyone Had To Obey, What Law Would You Create?

  Don't carelessly pollute the world. Each family should work together to do some sort of community service and take care of the environment in the area around them.
  
  I mean because this is the world we live in we should take care of it. Nothing forcefully... no... but I do believe that it should be talked about more.
  
  Not littering picking up plastic... recycling more and trying not to let so much pollution out in the air and water. Try to get as much contamination as we can out the waters. Try our best to preserve environments in our Wild Life.
