  You should definitely figure yourself out before finding somebody else. You got to make sure you can take care of yourself so you can  then take care of someone else..

  I mean yeah? But not like into them type sh-t. I grew uo with some of them. Some of them I don't talk to. Nothinf wrong with that. We aren't into eachother like that no more.
  
  And honestly I think it shows respect, morals in a way, shows what kind've a person you are in a good way... Shows that you have control.
  
  My husband knows one that I talk too and enjoya the person as a friend also. They are a good person. We just didn't wanna be like that(relationship type stuff) and we mutually ended it.. On good terms. So yeah it's definitely possible to make friends with other people, guys, even ex's. Just know your grounds and they better know there's. Respect.  There are boundaries. Knoe your place.
  
  Then.
  
  Trust one another. Me and my husband. We do.
  
  And people reading this won't know the trust in between me and my husband and it is extremely strong. We have trust loyalty with one another and love each other very much.

  ","
  Natural beauty, is easy and smiple. Is you. Original. What is given to you at the start and ya keep with it.
  
  Artificial beauty. For one the word artificial means...made or produced by human beings rather than occurring naturally, especially as a copy of something natural. Or/And... (of a person or their behavior) insincere or affected.
  
  Other words as..
  
  feigned,insincere,false, stilted,contrived,pretended...,actorly,overdone....
  
  So.... Artificial beauty is more or less constructed and put together when instead it could just be naturally and automatically done.
  
  What natural beauty it's almost like saying you are a a natural... it's just something you do without even trying.
  
  In which somebody one day will love everything about you just the way that you do it... they will love you for who you are. In ya own way.

  Too many honestly.
  
  :/ I'm very different and rather odd.
  
  I have a lot of issues with personal space... I do not like my new people touching me, getting near me for no absolute reason... (unless of course they're walking me that's different), grabbing me... pulling on my hair.... hugging me without my permission or kissing me. ?? I have had all of the above happened to me by complete strangers. :/ And when I say no... They get angry.. make a scene or make it seem like I am crazy and making it up but they know what their intention was and what they were trying to do... this is all true stories... I do not make this up.
  
  I am my way extreme clean and organized person.. extremely over obsessive with this... and I do it out of anxiety and relief. I do not like to share this much. I have some minor issues in this area I feel. But I do not know. It's hard to explain. You would have to be me to understand... Hard to talk about.
  
  Have alot of fear with driving. Have had a lot of near-death experiences with others almost killing me and hitting me.
  
  I am from a really dangerous part of Louisiana. So this crazy sh-t happens all the time.
  
  Work on artist knock on your window daily and you see prostitutes standing around on the. Protests happening annually all the time in the streets. Dozens and dozens of shootings a day... kidnappings... abductions... rape... murder... you name... on a daily and on the hour... constantly... drunk drivers hitting and killing people. The police cannot roam safely without wearing full body armor almost because there are citizens that just don't like them even though they haven't done anything to them personally. Go take other cops and punish all of them...
  
  I have a lot of phobias but honestly because I'm just tryna' be aware and safe. But at the same time I'm not one hundred percent terrified of all of that. I have control and ways to overcome my fears. I used to be deathly scared of snakes and I have gotten better over the years.

  These are my tattoos.
  
  But if I was to get another one I would get a huge piece on one of my thighs and it would be some really beautiful detailed Mardi Gras' masks mixed in with some other/extra Louisiana Cajun culture. And then maybe incorporating some skulls and roses and vines in the piece all around and in the background and stuff.
  
  And another piece I'm getting is on my left shoulder and it is of the world map because I have friends and family from all over the world. The world map would be dripping down with acrylic and wet paint to be a type of watercolor effect. Most of my tattoos have a watercolor effect.

  ","
  Can be for certain people... I mean..
  
  Cause ya definitely can't rush it. You have to be patient. It comes at different times and everyone's lives.
  
  It's really hard to find someone to settle down with because you have to settle down with everything about them. It's a full package ?.
  
  You don't want to look desperately for it because in the end... you will keep getting disappointed... or for some.. end up behind bars from some I have seem. Some that were too desperate..
  
  You can be by yourself. You do not HAVE to be with someone and have someone in your life all the time. We are human. Anything is possible. Including taking care of ourselves and being alone. I believe today's generation is going to believe this.
  
  Also watch out for people that like to play games. Some people like to make relationships complicated on purpose because they like to make a game out of it and waste people's time. Enjoy hurting people. So that's why you have to watch out for people and not look so desperately.

  I unexpectedly met my husband on Xbox 360 on a Grand Theft Auto game 6 years ago. We are married now with no issues. We are happy together. We were in a long distance relationship for 4 and 1/2 years before we finally were together. He is wonderful and I absolutely love them. He is good to me.

   Why is it that when you’re driving and looking for an address, you turn down the volume on the radio? ?

  I don't know why others do it but I know I do because it just seems like a multitasking type thing? I know it's weird to explain... But you wanna quite to be able to focus on that one thing and make sure you do it right, get where ya going. I can't have any noise when I'm trying to think. Just something that I just... cannot do with when tryna concentrate. Idky. I was like that in school. There would have to be complete silence for me to take a test or to read something.

  I try to turn my day around and just think of better things.

  Call a friend and talk to them.
  
  Relax.
  
  Go out.
  
  Hobbies help alot.
  
  Stay productive when feeling down.
  
  But to overcome the tears is hard. Sometimes it's almost better to let it out? Don't matter if ya a man, a woman.. a cop? a teacher? anyone. We are people. We feel. We deserve to cry, all of us and we also deserve to be happy.
  
  Look at what ya got. A life. That's all that matters. That you woke up that morning. Cause some don't. We need to appreciate that. Keep our heads up, because this world really us f-cked up.

And that is the scary part.. Bad sh-t can happen to you. You do not mess with demonic things...

  My gamertag on Xbox is actually xxBellaxxOuija.
  
  But the thing about it is I don't promote using Ouija boards at all... because 80% of hauntings are caused by the missusage of a Ouija board. Did ya know that? And that is a a truth. That is not a a bunch of numbers I made up? No...
  
  Ouija boards are literally just a portal to negative presences and negative energies.
  
  You have to really know how to use a Ouija board for you not to mess up and do it incorrectly.
  
  I personally know how to use a Ouija board.. but I don't use them... I choose not too. I have no reason to use them. Ouija boards are just... The game is just evil... I tried to educate people on Ouija boards and usually at the end of the lessons people don't even go near them anymore. These aren't just stories that I tell.. These aren't lies and stuff I make up... this is actual research that I have spent years and years on... though none of it is factual 100%? No. But these are things that I have spent years on... And I mean... Over a decade of research on...
  
  I don't think somebody would sit around for years studying something if it wasn't real? is my thing and I'm trying to get at... Ya know??
  
  This talking board is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words ""yes"", ""no"", ""hello"" and and ""goodbye"", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic called aplanchette.
  
  The planchette, and another word for it in French legit... Just plank... Lol
  
  It is a small, usually heart-shaped flat piece of wood and planchette is moved by the presence of spirits or some form ofsubtle energy. Usually. If there is activity in the area or if you arise some...
  
  Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. There are ways to tell if you're talkin to a negative spirits. Sometimes you don't always get negative spirits? Sometimes you really are talking to a positive spirit?

  ","
  I think you need to pay for counseling and go to a counselor because counselors can help you with so much. If you tell them what's going on around your house they will help you with so much and I'm serious. Play counselors can help you get out of your house if there's something going on.
  
  They will help you get driving lessons they will help you do all kinds of things.
  
  If you think that moving out and going with this other person that you're talking about is a good idea then go with it. But you definitely need to get the authorities in it.  money and just go to one counselor meeting. Get someone to take you and figure out some stuff. Don't just get up and go because then you can't get your things. And when you leave you need to explain to your parents the reason why you were going is not because you hate them it is because you were trying to grow up. It's time for you to grow up. Some parents tend to be a little overprotective because they want the best for you. They want to protect you because this world is crazy. But you should definitely be able to learn how to drive and get a job at this age. This is the age def to be doing that... It is important...
  
  Be careful and don't so anything you regret.
  
  Definitely go and seek counseling. They can help you out in your sistuation. Is the best thing in general atm for you.

   Ok you replied to my statement about moving out when I'm 18 my problem is that I can't get a job to actually try and buy a house because I wouldn't have a way to work and back and I have someone I can live with and their mom said I could work with them and help pay rent and I could buy me a house
  ","
  Yeah I know that sounds fine and dandy, but honestly you should learn how to drive and then you should definitely get a job and be very into your work and work hard and work your way up.
  
  Apply online to places go in and talk to managers. Try Associated groceries. Walk ride bikes. Bikes are cheap. Get a ride. Riding bikes are heathly.
  
  I think you should try re-establishing relationships with your parents.
  
  Then maybe down the line and a couple of months or years you can go and move in with that person. But it is extremely important to remain and relationship with your parents.

   If you are 18 and want to move out and you know your parents will say no can you still move out anyway?
  ","
  I mean yes you can move out? Depends on the laws in your area. You can talk to the authorities and talk to them about your rights.
  
  Though I wouldn't try leaving your parents unless you know for sure that you are okay and you can take care of yourself.
  
  The reasoning usually why your parents get angry when you are trying to leave is because they care about you and they want to help you. And they see that you aren't ready. Use living with your parents as an advantage. Get a job and save money. Finding a place to rent or put a down payment on house. Find you a room mate and rent.
  
  If your parents are really strict usually it's because they're trying to help you succeed.
  
  There is a small amount of parents that don't give a sh-t and are abusive and horrible to their kids. But this is not always the case.
  
  Respect your parents. Keep them on your side. Because when sh-t hits the fan you're going to need them. Your parents are who you want to be close to always. They're going to be the grandparents of your children. They raised you. They gave you so much.
  
  Though Idk your sistuation personally. This is what I hope they have done for you. Give them credit. If they even stay in your life and kept you under their roof they did enough for you.  Some kids growing up don't have parents and die for that type of affection and attention...
  
  You're going through some stuff in your life... try to let your parents know that you want to start over with them and try to make a relationship with them.
  
  And if you feel like you are able to take care of yourself then let them know that.  but if you are not sure that you can take care of yourself and why not just stay?
  
  Just wait... you have your whole life ahead of you. Try to be young as long as you can because that is a shortest time and your life... and when you start to get older you will realize that statement.

  One of them I could pick for this category... would be the day I was with my Paw paw... we were walking a couple blocks down from thier house and I found this white shell on the ground... picked it up and was just looking at it and loved it and then... All the sudden... The newspaper people ? people came by (we're bored, I guess? Lol) and took pictures of me, my Paw paw and the rock I had found and I got to get put paper! I just never understood why I got put in the paper for a rock? Lol I guess cuz I was just a little and they maybe thought it random? Cute? Different? I mean loved the rock? But... my Paw paw also knew the people, so that was probably why. He was also the fire chief at the time. Fire Department. So lol that's probably why? I don't fully remember it... but I remember seeing the newspaper article and I was like six or seven years old may be younger? holding what it looked like... a little shell looking rock, white little rock? in my hand with my Paw paw next to me. I miss my Paw paw. He was a great man... sweet.. great person. Kind.. A hero. Military. Fire Department. Paw paw.

  The best thing I can tell you is to go and see a doctor (one.. It's not that much at all a visit..) and two.. because they can help you adjust your diet to where you want...and to... lose weight.
  
  Sometimes it's not always good idea for you to do it yourself, because you could be going at it wrong and that could be the reason why you're getting discouraged.
  
  You can ask your doctor for maybe either some weight loss pills? or to change your diet? At the same time you need to exercise a lot and a properly. You can also get you a personal trainer or maybe ask your doctor to give you recommendations if they have any?
  
  Three you have got to build your self-esteem and confidence and believe that you can do it.
  
  To lose weight you have to be positive and believe in yourself you cannot be negative.
  
  You also have to be patient. Losing weight does not take 2-3 weeks. I don't care what any of those ads online say... or any of those YouTube videos say... Losing weight can take them months, to years, but is possible for anyone.
  
  But do not procrastinate and not go to the doctor. This is the best way to start your dieting.
  
  Another thing is do not do it for just the first week and then give up stick at it. Make it a new lifestyle.
  
  Make it a challenge and give up a few things.
  
  One year I gave up for a couple months chocolate and soda and then after I just kept going with it. Now.. I don't really eat anymore sweets like I used to and I don't drink anymore soda.
  
  Soda is bad for you. It's okay to have a little bit every now and then but then you become addicted to it. Soda hurts your stomach and doesn't have a poistives to it... Cut is out for awhile... you will see that you will feel more energy in your life and that you won't want it anymore... Just by cutting soda out completely. Try homemade lemonade? Or tea maybe? Not huge portions.. No. Water needs to be your best friend. Try infused water. It is fun and delicious.
  
  But honestly I'm not a doctor. See your doctor and def.

   How old do people typically assume that you are, compared to your actual age? Do you ever find it offensive when people think you are significantly older/younger?
  ","
  I just think age is an unimportant thing. Most of the time it's a type of thing people want to know to unravel some more information from you to find out more and more... It's just a personal thing.
  
  I need to know. My husband and the people in person around need to know it... more or less. Not people that I don't inparticular know.
  
  I don't even tell people that I don't know in real life. I don't give away too much personal information. I have had someone try to steal my identity before and age is one type of informations that they used...
  
  People know how old you are, then they feel under matched or over matched with you. Can also tend toq treat you different based off of your age. This is not always the case, but again I don't know who will do this.. Most of the time is the case.
  
  Then some want to know because they are interested in me or are wanting to be... So they are asking how old I am to know if I am around their age... Usually the norm...
  
  Find someone around ya age... ya know? And I am clearly not interested... I am married. It is on my profile biographies... All of them... It's in respect of myself and my husband.
  
  I also do not want to seem leading... If I answer more of their questions... and I already knowing where they are getting with the conversation in the 1st place? Then why even continue? Ya know? I try to lay down some ground rules, basics... and tried to explain to them that I only want to be friends but some people don't take the rejection easily... usually get mad. I am very polite. People are just sad.. Lol yeah... If your gonna ask... Don't get mad at the answers. Whether theu be good or not. Lol then don't ask!
  
  It's personal information. Nobody needs to know. I choose not to tell people because I don't have to.
  
  We have choice and I use it there.

  Depends on what kind've ""talking"" you mean.
  
  If it is just a conversation... I mean we are all human.. There should be no steps in that. Just strike it!

Temptation it part of it and you have to learn control. Having control can be attractive. Not physical... No.. Do not hit and scare people... Not cute.. Not attractive at all. Respect the person... Obviously... To ""talk"" to them.. Be yourself. Funny. Talk about relevant things. Nothing controversial. Fun.

  My husband, Jason. Met him six years ago unexpectedly on Xbox 360 on a game called Grand Theft Auto V. Greatest man in the world. We got to know each other well and really liked eachother and then 5 years later we got married. Haha. That's just a summary. He's my best friend. We have been through some of the hardest obstacles I have ever experienced in my life. Long distance.

  But... I don't talk about too many subjects on the news because those topics are usually sensitive to people. They tend to start a lot of arguments in between people.

  ","
  No problem and that is so nice that you give to charities. I wish I could give more to charities. I give as much as I can to charities and volunteer my time as much as I can.
  
  For most of my life I volunteered to help others that did not have food and clothes. I volunteered at my families owned food bank in my town and starting from a real young age.. I don't regret a single day helping those people even though I didn't know them. All that mattered is that I help someone in need.
  
  And then during all the Hurricanes down here and all the flooding, we also helped those people as well with a home to stay... well my mom did, but of course they stayed with all of us and we help them with food, clothing, entertainment for months. I mean we had like 40 people staying at our house and some of them we didn't even know. I mean they had absolutely nowhere to go? What do you say to those kinds of people? Ya know what I mean? So we took them in and the next day we found a lot of them places to stay. Cuz some of them didn't have cars, anyway of transportation to a shelter or anything. They had nothing. They lost everything to the floods. So me and my family mentally and physically help those people. Some of them we knew and some of them were family and friends and some of them we didn't know, but we didn't care? the fact was that we help someone in need.
  
  All true. None of this is made up. These are actual events that have happened in my life.

I caught a really  poisonous snake on my fishing reel when I was 10 and never since then I've been really terrified of snakes. But I'm trying face that fear and get one as a pet and hopefully it will be friendly overtime to me! Hopefully.

  ","
  Yeah. I have to change my words around a bunch.
  
  It works... Just you have to like work with it alot..
  
  Some worda don't mean the same in some lanugages and some lanugages don't even have words that we even use in English. It's really complicated to understand.
  
  But for sure to use a translator.. You almost have to have your own language yourself.

  Yes. I love to talk to anyone I can even if is in a different language! Challenge!

   Trouble is some of these people let the obstacles get to them, and like you said they should be appreciative of their partner ? I can tell from your answer that yourself and your husband are a strong couple, which is brilliant ? ?
  ","
  Absolutely we have to be strong.. For course.. You must be when being away from one another for such long periods of time.. I mean a long time.. for a half years of long-distance and then I think the longest we didn't see each other was for 14 months? almost? Yeah... Dang. I remember. The... hardest year... and 2 months... EVER.
  
  Communication**
  
  That's all you need!
  
  And when we saw each other? All we did was rode around together.. That's all we wanted?! was just to be together! to hear each other's voice! But nooo.. This generation.. That wouldn't have been enough. Well.. That must not be your type of relationship goals. ? but not seeing someone for that long? Some of these people couldn't even do it for a week.. They'd freakk. Lol.
  
  And then all these people everybody act like relationships just revolve around being physical.. being together doing stuff together... Relationships are supposed to be an adventure! spontaneous and amazing.. that's something that you start together and you live it together and you create something out of it together! You make it your own story. ❤?
  "
54463,"
   That's great, considering long-term relationships never normally work out, but thankfully in your case and your husband's case, it's worked out brilliantly ? ?
  ","
  Ikr?! I get really aggravated when I hear people getting angry about their relationship when they didn't have the types of obstacles me and my husband had. They should be appreciative of there significant other because they could had those types of things happen to them...
  
  Yes we chose those difficulties and we accepted the challenge... but see my point is... people take things for granted, they don't have nothing to show for anything? They aren't respectful of what they got. They aren't appreciative of what they've got. They think the wrong things that a relationship revolves around. People have lost hope and long-term relationships and marriage... loyalty... and being faithful to one another... People also think that you have to have someone else in your life to live. Everyone is so afraid of being alone that they settle for the lowest. You can live alone and by yourself and be independent and happy. You don't NEED somebody else. I have been single before, single for years and was happy and fine with that.
  
  There's no self-respect? there's no morals? I love being with my husband and I'm very appreciative of him and what I've got.
  
  People don't even simply just take a shower? there's no self-respect? they don't care for themselves so how can they care for somebody else? They don't go to the doctor? They don't care about having multiple kids on accident? They don't care if they catch a disease? They don't care if they wear nasty, revealing clothes? And then everybody wonders why there's so much r_pe going around? Long story on how I feel on this topic... But is the truth on how I feel.

  Crazy enough...
  
  I met my husband almost 6 years ago... On that game on xbox 360 unexpectedly. Without me trying out that game when it came out... Without me getting that xbox369 as a gift from my older sister and hmher bf at the time... I would've never met him.. I'm happy for every single event that has ever happened in my life, negative or positive, everything happens for a reason. And this all is as result. I am haloy and married. A bit far from everyone, but that's okay. I still can visit and call, video chat. Can make it all happen/work.
  
  We were in a long distance relationship for 4 and a half years before we finally were together for real.
  
  I knew everything about him and his family, he knew everything about me and my family. We had met about six or seven months into the relationship and everything went very good. I met him with a small group of people. And I have video chatted him many times before I met him and like I said knew everything about him before I met him.
  
  I loved everything about him and so. In November 2017? He had asked to marry me and we weren't fully together then.. No but that December we had decided to move in together and I am here with him now... then that next September... Right on his birthday I told him.... Hey.. Would you like to go and get married tomorrow? Haha and he said what? I said yeah. I am asking you again. Haha and the 12th? Of September? Or maybe th 18th? We got our license and then on the 21st of 2018 we got married, we had the event and I loved everything about us getting married. I was happy to be called the Mrs. Of his. And yeah. It is hard to believe everything I just said, but it is all so true. Truth. Me and Jason.

  I find age an unimportant characteristic in people online needing to know. I find when people find out about my age they tend to treat me differently and people don't realize they do it. It's kind of just an automatic thing that people do. People say oh I wasn't going to do that but they automatically do it. They don't do it off of being cruel or intentional? No. It is just something that clicks. I find people respect me more when they don't know my age. I know that's weird. But over time I have noticed. I don't ever ask people for their age because I don't specifically care. I treat everyone the same whether they're a boy or a girl or if they have a different age, if they're older or younger.
  
  It's nothing against anyone particularly, no. It's just something I just choose to not share.

54597,"
   As to what you said about Alaska, it sounds like the ideal place to retire to tbh, thank you for telling me all about it, all I hear from others is they get blizzards all the time ?
  ","
  Absolutely.
  
  And blizzard isn't even the level of how cold it gets out there. They called there Winters, dark Winter. There in that part of the world, it gets around 20 hours of dark and only a few hours a light and then it reverses depending on the times of the year and stuff and the world axis.
  
  So you may have to get used to that kind of stuff. Going to sleep with the sun still out but it's actually nighttime technically or in other words time to go to sleep and rest. It sometimes being longer days 20 something hours long of light and only a few of night.
  
  But when in the winter... I mean it gets negative -40, -50, -60 with wind chills making it even colder. I mean you have to wear like tons of clothing, masks, gloves, socks and socks, boots and you can't be out too long or you will catch hypothermia in minutes. And then the snow is so piled up in front of the doors and then it's hard to walk through it and then the wind hitting you? Omgosh...
  
  But the summers are so nice.
  
  You really have to learn to adapt when moving to Alaska. You have to learn nature tips and survival tips. How to start a fire. Learn how to hunt and keep tons, too much in your freezer just in case if you're not able to leave your home for weeks.
  
  You have to be careful because there are not many towns and cities and right next to each other. There are towns and cities but not as abundant as other parts of the world and other places.
  
  When going through the town and cities unless you live around the stores... sometimes they run out of items because there's not as many stores as other places outside of Alaska so you maybe limited on supplies.
  
  When living really far out in the bush, if you need a hospital, doctor attention you have to ride hours maybe even a plane to get to the nearest hospital or doctor.
  
  I'm not knocking Alaska. It's really a challenge living out there. It is totally worth it and is an absolutely beautiful place with its nature. I want to move myself.

I've always wanted to visit Alaska just for week. I did want to visit Germany, Australia, France and the UK. many other places. I want to go and walk at Venice Beach in California.

  Absolutely. A lot of Alaska is untouched of its natural beauty. A lot of the land has been sitting there for hundreds of years, if not longer, and hasn't even been walked on before.
  
  It is absolutely an amazing place to go to in the summer. It's not too cold or hot it's just right. There's lots of natural, fun activities to do. You can also maybe get with family that's out there, maybe stay, and maybe have them show you some of the traditions of how they hunt/catch and prepare their food. They will show you how they live out there. It is slightly different out there especially in the deep dark winters with temperatures very very very low such as -40 negative -50 s if not lower with wind chills even more colder.
  
  The only thing bad about the summer is just everything is so dry..  flicking a cigarette is almost a crime...
  
  But Alaska to me I feel like is amazing vacation spot. Lots of fishing and hunting. King Salmon as big out there. You can go bird shooting/hunting and Egg nest catching (sounds horrible but there are millions of eggs out there layed in Alaska and it's actually an Alaskan tradition for some families to go out nest catching, not the exact name for it but is a type hunting/collecting done out there) you can go moose hunting, there is fox, caribou I believe, polar bear, many different species of birds, wolves, lynx... And so much more.
  
  There's more to Alaska than just the hunting and fishing, there's tourist, riding in Planes, visiting the beauty of the land, mountains, plenty of snow! ...staying in a cabin, tent camping, there's Rivers, hotels... There's alot to Alaska. The land is good to ya.

You have a bright personality and do not deserve to be upset all the time. Don't bring yourself down. And it's okay to remember them. That is good. But don't linger on it.. You will always be continuously sad.. Not good.

  You mean like.. What's a characteristic or habit that I can't stand that someone does?
  
  I definitely can't stand someone that constantly about themselves and it's totally selfish.
  
  I do not like it when someone is super discriminative or judgmental to others and on their views in life. What they want to do and how. What they want to believe. Choose to do. Leave them be.. Unless it is affecting you.. Mind your own business. Simple.
  
  I do not like someone that just takes their anger out on people because they aren't doing sh-t peachy in their life... so they have to be ugly to someone else to make themselves feel better and they knowing what they're doing... They are doing it on purpose. To be mean and ugly to others.
  
  Or like someone that feels like to have to be treated as certain way... Like as in.. like if I'm a cashier and I am giving them service and I am.. I am providing that... but they expect me to like completely kiss their ass that's not how it works.

Life with Derek, Drake and Josh, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Pokemon, Totally Spies, Sailor Moon, Powerpuff Girls, Rugrats, CatDog, The Proud Family, Kim Possible, Hey Arnold, Cyberchase.

  No I'm flattered with compliments but as long as they don't disrespect or cross lines and get nasty and threatening then I'm more than fine with it.
  
  Because it says clearly in my BIO it says that I am married. I do not mind compliments I do not mind people say kind things about me. But sometimes people try to ask me out regardless of my relationship status... and then get angry when I give them the honest truth and they feel rejection and start threatening me and stuff. Just because you can't go out with me doesn't mean you have to dislike me and hate on me?? There's a thing called friendship. You should be happy that I'm happy and safe.

   oh hello there, what makes you different from others :)
  ","
  I mean I can tell ya a few things about me. Not sure what makes me different then others but.. I guess here's a few things I do that I don't think too many do. Lol.
  
  Something no odd.. But my most favorite thing to do is probably sing. Love to sing. Been singing since I was a little girl. 6 or 7 years old. Have sang at many different events. Schools. Football games. Colleges. Churches. Was lead Cantar at my school for a few years. Lead the choir.
  
  I have researched the paranormal for many years. 13 or more years. I just find it a  challenging, interesting and curious subject to research. I find it something that not a lot of people research.  I do not do it in an evil or satanic way.. I am not like this... This is not my work... No. I am very respectful about the afterlife. The spirit life. I respect people that don't believe in it. I respect Skeptics. I just don't respect people that make fun of me, because of it. Because I have have other people that have seen what I have seen at the same time. Heard what I have heard.. I researched many different levels of the Paranormal. I go on Urban Explorations. I study the history on the place and what has happened in there. Extremely respectful about it. I pay my respects. It's really cool. You get to travel a lot and visit a lot of different places and meet people.
  
  I am Cajun French. Am a Coonass. From southern Louisiana. No a VooDoo person, no. They have it down here tho. But I do not associate with that type of stuff.
  
  I enjoy building guns, working on cars and making knives. Little bit of blacksmithing there.
  
  I enjoy painting and wood burning. Wood burning is probably the more odd one, it's very fun though.
  
  Love tattoos. Enjoy getting them. But that's probably one that is not odd.
  
  I love marine biology, geography, meteorology, photography and studying about gems and rocks.
  
  Love animals.
  
  I enjoy cooking, socializing helping people.
  
  Used to ice skate.
  
  Race. Do tricks and stuff.
  
  Roller blade.
  
  Skateboard.

  But the water from up north anf all the melting snow runs off into our Mississippi River and it has to go out somewhere... And that's to the Gulf of Mexico and that is down here where we arw at. The water levels usually go down almost to half to what it's at now. It should've went down almost a whole month ago now! If not longer. But it is still to the rim. That's what is so unnormal and strange?? Idk. It's whatever.

   hi so I'm a guy and Im  about to move to Nola for my last year of HS. Im from San francisco and I realized my sophomore year I was Bi but way more into guys. But I'm scared I'm going to have to go back in the closet since its the south. Will people make fun of me if I want a boyfriend?
  ","
  I think you need to surround yourself with positive people and do what you want, that makes you happy and don't worry about what other people think of you.
  
  I think that when you do go down and to the South be careful with who you talk to and ask out.. If you are interested in guys... Because then that's where it can go.. bad south.. be careful and aware.
  
  I have had girls come up to me and asked me out? and I do get a little weirded out because I am not bi or gay at all, but I don't show it as long as they respect my space and my view, my answer.. so it does not upset them. I do not mind the ask and complement.. Because to be liked by anyone is a blessing. But she asked if I was bi and I said no. She was sad. She told me her feelings towards me and I told her thank you but I am not interested. She understood and left it there.
  
  But see.. Not everyone is like me and will react that way.. And be humble about it... Kind about it... You be you. Be very respectful about it. Just like you would if you were straight... Cause people will be people and some people do not accept bi or gays.. Because of how they were raised... religions...
  
  You have to overlook certain things. People are going to be cruel about it.
  
  And if you are going to want to be bi... Or gay.. You are gonna have to learn to have a hard backbone.. Learn to stand your ground or you will have to hide.. Don't get too c0cky.. Because then people may get angry... And react physically.. Just be aware. Be strong. Be confident. Be you.

(They need to be working on improving themselves) Growing up and passing that phase is good... But if not, It could cause problems in trying to find a mate in the future life. If you grow passed it all.. Then it could result in a good relationship with a man. If not.. Hating the same sex... other girls... then you are giving them all these unnecessary boundaries... shielding them off from part of the world and the ability in making certain types of friends... they aren't gonna be happy... that's what's wrong with the world and why people can't stay in one relationship for more than a week.. If you are going to be with this other person, you both need to improve communication and trust.. You've gotta work at it together. But to do this.. You have to grow up and learn how to get over yourself.. Don't be so selfish... Care more in general and then for people. Respect yourself. Gain morals. Care. Even for strangers. Cause if you can't even for strangers? for yourself? Then how will you for even another person that you want to be with.. And maybe even one day forever?

  Just the other day... we had an 18-wheeler decide that it wanted to turn in front of us when we had the right away... and we were going normal speed?? we had to slam on the brakes or we would have head on them and they were at fault... Would have been a horrible crash...
  
  Have had a Mustang ride across lanes of traffic through a huge and deep median into our lanes of traffic! and almost head-on us.
  
  18 wheelers come into our lane nearly knocking us into ditches.. Them at fault... Have had a van almost run us off a bridge.. Them at fault.. Not seeing us.. Almost flipped us off a high bridge... That's a few...

  "
55202,"
   Do you have issues with your phone holding a charge?
  ","
  I used to. And then I had someone explain to me the proper way of letting a battery work and then die and then recharge it again.
  
  A lot of people just use their phone until like 15% or 5%. And then they charge it when actually you're supposed to wait until it completely dies. Give the battery a break.
  
  They say that you need to charge your phone to 100%, then use it all the way down to when it dies, let the phone die for a little while and then recharge it and turn it back on. Continuing to recharge your phone over and over is not good for the battery. Let the whole battery be in use, then charge it up.
  
  I have killed a few batteries not doing this. If your phone is showing that it is dying faster than what it was when you first got it, that is a sign of killing the battery. It will result in you having to buy a whole new battery for the phone.
  
  If your percentages are just jumping around and it dies at like 17% randomly? I find this another sign that your phone battery is going bad... this is just based off of my experiences.

   What scares you most about your future?
  ","
  The schools are so crazy kids/teachers bringing guns and knives to school. Parents and kids performing sexual acts together. That is becoming more popular nowadays... nasty.. gross.. twisted and jist unacceptable... People should be learning in school! THAT'S IT! These kids in school the other ones are so... Idk... Just makes me nervous for my kids?? now it seems like it... It's sad..

  I would appreciate it if the people at my job, the customers wouldn't have their kids running out the door into the middle of the road... where obviously cars drive around... so I don't have a heart attack?? Or allow the kids to run around in the bleach are open bleach and try to drink it... they were obviously too young to understand what they were doing? But in today's lofe.... if I do anything? they get pissed off and yell at me... that is the parents now'a'days.. sadly... but that is a way clearly... that they accidentally kill themselves. There should be a parent attending at all times. That's the point I am tryna' make. Nowadays people are too comfortable with their surroundings. They don't realize people will snatch kids.

  If she's being f-cked up about it and is blocking you and sh-t. Just wait until the baby's born... I know it's sad that you won't be there for the baby when it's born but it comes down to it... mention the fact that you had no ways in getting contacted to be there for the birth and sh-t... (B/c he blocked you off) People will side with you. Because if you were with her in between and all that good stuff that I could possibly be your child . But for real.. you can get DNA test and find out if it's your baby. If she don't know who the dad is. She doesn't like you and doesn't want you to be the dad? then I don't want to tell you. But if you really are the dad? then tuff sh-t! That's how it works??? She has to get over it and that's your kid also.

  ","
  Yes. I'm aware. They don't wany anymore war and problems anymore. Because they were having issues within and out the country. They have to watch the people that come in. And they have real troubled people actting up.
  
  I don't blame them for being the way they are. I just say. When going on. Better to stay with the people so they can explain to people you are foreign and not understanding of how they do things. Their laws and stuff. And they will understand.
  
  There are also certain things you have to do before mining in certain areas. They have blessings and certain rituals they do before mining. Which is cool and different.

  My husband likes to make rings. We both love to gem hunt. That is fun also. A very fun hobby and you can make alot of money off of.
  
  But yes. Smithing can be a profession for sure. It's hard to get certain parts for certain guns. And alot of people don't know where to go to get them. Bug processes you have to go through to get such. Also it can be tedious at times, putting the guns together. People pay big money for you to find them the parts and then put them together, help with all the paperwork.
  
  And that's cool ASMR is good.

  Yep.
  
  It's just because they don't know? They aren't used to that kinda stuff. Hearing that kinda stuff. People just get mad if they don't like what they hear and tend to just say what they feel in a ugky way and then move on. Walk away. Don't talk to again. Randim. Strangers. They enjoy they're selfs. They are afraid of the idea. All of it. People are scared of afterlife and evil. You have to over power it. That's why there is so much more crime. Evil and demonic stuff is lurking.. People are 100% perfect and wonderful and then mess with the wrong sh-t and then all the sudden just crack?? Sounds like people are turning away from faith. You've gotta have faith in something. Whether it be a God or a type of Savor. It doesn't matter. Light. You've gotta be positive and have at least faith in yourself. So you can be safe. People just auto think I'm like up to some werid twisted type stuff and I'm not... It's the complete opposite. I'm balling the heck up and facing some of the scariest tyoe stuff you could ever get into to figure it out for people so I can inform people on the types of stuff I get and see. I witness. To keep them aware. But noo... People HAVE to see it with THIER OWN TWO EYES... And feel it.. Not eveyone are liars? Not everyone is bs? Some people are being real about the stuff they say.
  
  It's whatever. I know what I have see and witnessed. And I stick to it. If someone chooses to not believe me. Well then they can. That's them. Have fun.

  Yes that is true... Though Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Pennsylvania is very haunted. I find alot of my hot spot locations are in the south.
  
  Tennessee
  
  Louisiana for sure
  
  Texas has some of the most haunted palces in the world.
  
  Florida, very.
  
  Georgia, very.
  
  North and South Carolina, def.
  
  Mississippi.
  
  I mean.. I'm telling ya... Theres hundreds of locations.
  
  Stuff that people have stupidly conjured up. Massacres. Brutal murders. Drowning... Rest their souls... But yeah... Alot of different types of deaths. Unrested anger spirits. Poltergeists. Negative energys. Positive, but sad and lost spirits. And the most worst. Demonic, evil, and horrible presences... Those are ones you have to watch out for. Those are inhuman like creatures that just want to destroy the living. They prey on the living. Want nothing good for us. Horrible creatures. They are tricky and manipulative. Want to take over and hurt.
  
  Alot if people don't like me for what I study. But it is there. It's not stuff you see just right off the top of your head. But you do the research. And I mean.. It's years and years of researching. It's not... Oh go and watch a tv shown and bam! No. You actually get out and see for yourself. And sometimes it takes awhile, but once you experience it. It changes your perspective on everything..... It's honestly what us as children.. What we feared? I mean.. Can you fight it? Absolutely. But you'd be suprised the power... That those beings have.. How lost they are. How confusing it all is. Continuous and endless theories and studies. Nothing factual. All you can do is witness and explain your story. Is definitely not stuff I make up. I do not wish to waste peoples time on something that isn't true or real. This is stuff that I have witnessed and what others have with me.
  
  It's whatever though.
  
  I respect people's views.
  
  As long as they respect mine.

A EF5 Tornado, the level of that tyoe of a tornado is impossible to survive in unless you are underground... If you are ever in the path of one and are above ground... You ars in serious trouble. When you hear that super cells are even remotely close to your area. Make sure you quickly get ready. Just in case.. Gather important items together in a backpack. Each person with one. Quickly. With about 5 days of clothes at least. Underwear, bras, pads, toothbrush, little soap maybe. Medications. Important papers. Wallets. Warm and cold type clothes.... Little food. Water. With. Shelters will help you there with food and water. You want to make sure you have socks and shoes on. Good clothes on. All kids and pets underground. Maybe close all the doors in your home. Shut all windows. Make sure your electronics are with you. Important ones.. Nothing you can do about your cars house or items in there.... Save yourself and your loved ones.. That tyoe of disaster just makes you see more clearer.. Makes you learn to appreciate more what you've got. The people around you.

   How do you manage to stay slim?
  ","
  There's multiple different ways that you can do to try to stay Slim.
  
  Make sure you eat enough meals in the day don't overeat. Don't eat too much at once. Choose healthy choices when eating. Walk it off. Jog. Lift weights. Ride a bike. Do yard work or cut grass. Make sure you stay hydrated throughout the day. You can go to your doctor and get them to put you on a special diet. Avoid a lot of different greasy foods and sodas. Give up eating bread for a month and you will see the difference in weight just by not eating bread. Drink milk but not too much. Learn to get on a sleeping schedule and only sleep 7 to 8 hours. Wake up early in the morning and run for about 30 minutes come inside take a shower.
  
  Eat breakfast before, after whenever. Eat a small and heathly serving.
  
  Go to the gym more. Get you a dog and go walking with them all the time.
  
  Don't eat within 4 hours of you bout to go to sleep.
  
  Don't stay up super duper late.
  
  Shower regularly. Not like 3 times a day??? Once or twice.
  
  When eating, take your time.

  I love the little Lean Cuisine meals that you get from the store.
  
  But cook or make?
  
  Usually I don't cook anything until dinner. Cuz I'm always busy around lunch. So sometimes I'll just have a sandwich or hot dog or I'll go and get something to eat. But sometimes I throw together and alfredo with some vegetables or something. I love noodles and pasta.

   What are your favorite type of questions to be asked? Questions about your life? Ones that make you think? Just opinions?
  ","
  Anything really.
  
  My least favorite are inappropriate sexual nasty gross questions.
  
  I don't like super personal questions... questions on religion, politics, age, specific location, certain views.
  
  I am extremely open-minded. Extremely respectful. So when people tell me their age... Their religion... Age (I don't treat them differently based on their age. That's why I don't like telling my age. I hang with all ages. I have friends that are 80. Friends that are 45. Friends that are in their 30s, 20s, kids! Treat all the same. Of course I make exceptions with children) When people tell me their political views. Sexual orientation... Location.. I tend to just accepted and not judge them or treat them differently from what they are or where they're from. I treat people the way that they treat me from today, not the past. I don't judge them. I have friends and family from all over the world. ? Kind to all and love or I at least try to.
  
  My favorite types of questions to be asked are probably things that are in my biography and things that are closely related to my biography.
  
  Questions about my culture.
  
  Tradition. I don't mind sharing as long as people as respectful.
  
  Food. Cooking. Art. Singing
  
  Gaming. Gem hunting.
  
  Hunting. Tools. Cars. Tattoos.
  
  Trucks. Fishing. Country.
  
  Music. World Cultures.
  
  Geography. Photography.
  
  Fun. Drinks. Animals. Smithing.
  
  Youtube. Space. Rocks.
  
  Weather. Yardwork. Farming.
  
  Building stuff. Building guns.
  
  Making knives. Usa. Traveling.
  
  Paranormal. Fireworks.
  
  Urban exploration. Maps.

   How do you get rid of stress and negative energy?
  ","
  Getting ridof negative influences. of course, some negative people are unavoidable. But try your best to delete as much of it outta your life as possible.
  
  Clean outyourhouse/office/space. First of all, unclutter. Old things inyourhouse trap a lot of negative energy.
  
  Changeyour way of thinking.
  
  Taking a limg relaxing bath.
  
  Maybe get on the phone and vent with someone you know and love.
  
  Put all ofyour worries on paper.
  
  Meditate??? Yoga? Crazy enough. Works. Listen to a really good song while?
  
  Visualize stuff in your life more.
  
  Try to work things out.
  
  Take a break. Everyone has days when it seems like nothing goes right.
  
  Attract the right crowd. Look around.
  
  Practice breathing. You can practice breathing anywhere.
  
  Take a walk.
  
  Laugh. Even randomly.
  
  Relax.
  
  Vent.
  
  Sh-t! Dance!
  
  Be happy! Your here and alive. That's all the positivity you should need.

   Lol some people really think ask.fm is a messenger or dating app ???✋
  ","
  Yeah and they don't really do the research very well before they start asking questions. Like reading biographies? or looking at some of the photos or just looking at the default?! So disrespectful. Pitiful. Kind of nasty, some of them. And then when I tell them I'm married some of them are like I don't care... and I'm like well I do?! LOL when I start saying like disrespectful things about my husband and start getting mad or jealous or pissed off at the  rejection??? and it's like... Youuuuuu (them), they decided to come on here and ask me, a married gal some questions about getting a hook up of some sort?? Lol I'm dude. I've got the best over here. I love him. He cares for me and is good to me. Respectful. Wonderful husband. That's why I married him! The f-ck do ya think?! People just think marriage isn't that serious anymore? That it's maybe a joke maybe?
  
  But I don't understand why they don't just save theirselves the trouble and read a biography? Or maybe look at a few photos or something?
  
  And I don't mind if they ask if I'm married but respect that. Or if I'm single or not? But when I honestly answer the question respect the answer!
  
  Oh this isn't a dating site so really so they shouldn't be asking those questions anyway?! LOL

  ","
  Are you trying to figure out alternatives to get yourself to go to sleep faster??
  
  Take a hot lavender bath?
  
  Smell the lavender and relax in it. Lavender helps to make ya sleepy! ??
  
  You can always take a little Benadryl. Benadryl is good for your allergies just don't take it regularly it's okay to take it every now and then. Just make sure that you're not allergic to it, like with all things. You shouldn't be, but ya never know. Better to talk to a doctor on that one.
  
  Try to slow down your breathing when going to sleep and try to shut down all parts of your body and relax everything.
  
  Try listening music?
  
  Don't be too hot or cold
  
  Extremely comfortable bed pillows and blanket
  
  Make sure that you don't need a new box spring or bed
  
  Because sometimes I lose track of how old they are and become too accustomed to how uncomfortable they are. We all make mistakes even about our beds.
  
  Make sure you're hydrated not overly hydrated.
  
  I sleep with my pup next to me he helps me go to sleep.
  
  I have to be really cold when I sleep I have multiple fans on in my room plus I love the sound of a fan when I sleep
  
  I have polished cotton blankets and pillow cases and they are so cool and comfortable
  
  Make sure that you don't have any sleep apnea problems. You can go to a sleep doctor and find out more information about that.
  
  Make sure that you don't have any high blood pressure problems that can also affect your sleep.
  
  You could have insomnia.
  
  But if you're just asking me what kind of things I do in general to entertain myself I just get on my phone cook something call someone?
  
  But usually I just try to go back to sleep.

   What’s your attitude towards hunting?
  ","
  I love to hunt. But I only hunt what I need food from freezer. To eat. And I do not hunt anything endangered. I go by all the rules. Go about it with respect. I do not shoot in violence or something? Like just wanting to hurt and leave? No... I hunt for food. It is also a love. The nature. Hearing it all around you. The wait. The work. You really learn how to appreciate nature at a whole different level. When I shoot something, I always thank God for providing food for me. And eat every inch of what I have hunted. No waste. A lot of people don't like to hunt and I'm fine with their opinion. I am not the one to judge. I respect everybody and their views and opinions as long as they're respectful back to mine. I find there absolutely is nothing wrong with hunting it's a natural thing that has been around for trillions of years. At some points in life and in the world hunting was all you had to be able to survive.  It's not exactly something we have to do? now but I choose... plus! when you're low on funds??  hunting is a good way to get free food... But you've gotta work for it... And it takes alot of patience...
  
  That's my views on hunting.

  I know a few people that do Tik Tok. And they're really really good at it. But there's literally people on there that make really weird annoying cringey videos on purpose. And I mean if that's what they want to do I guess whatever but those the videos I try to avoid watching cuz they're kind of just a waste of time and they are weird annoying and cringy.
  
  But I knew one really good friend and he was a really nice fella. And he used to make some really funny country Tik Tok videos. Well he recently was acting kind of strange and very sad it seemed and lonely kinda? Slightly? Not truthfully enough for everyone to like notice. I talked to the fella and I was nice to him and friended him. Just friends. And a few months later he committed suicide. I guess he just was not happy. That made me very sad and I miss him because he's a nice kid. It's just really sad that's all. So when I think of Tik Tok I think of that person. It's just sad to me because such good people get taken out of this world. Ya know? But yeah that's why I don't really say much bad things about the app because that was one of his ways out was using that app. But I don't really like to use the app too much and like I said my sister likes to use it and she's really good at using it.

  If you're 14 and you're with a 15 year that's fine, because If that same 14 year old is still with that same person (the 15 year old, years later) when they turn 18, I find that okay and different. Just depends ont their situation. Ya know.

  I have researched the Paranormal for many many years now.. around 12 to 13 years now? It is definitely a subject that I am very interested and curious in. I go on many Urban Explorations was friends and family. We have seen and heard many things. Could be unexplained could be debunked of something different? Never know? I get people that are skeptical on the subject and I mean that's fine, it's a very skeptical subject in general. Iit's something that's not very researched and written down factual, proved.
  
  I respect anybody's beliefs and thoughts on the subject 100% as long as they are respectful back.
  
  No I'm not no.. demon worshippers, satanic person?? No that's not what I do. You actually have to have a lot of faith and pray and be very careful when dealing with the paranormal.
  
  I research the Paranormal in a very respective way. I like to find out the history behind things and what happened. I like to pay my respects to the people individually.
  
  It's a whole new level of respect I find.
  
  I love researching the unknown because it's subject that will always be challenging... unknown levels of finding out things.
  
  Extremely interesting.

  I know some that don't like it at all and I know some that can't have it at all because they are allergic to it or allergic to it. Some factories produce chocolate with other products in the factory and you still can't have that chocolate bar because the dust from that other product can get on the other product. So you can't have that product neither that candy bar. So say for instance if someone was allergic to peanuts, make sure that you read every single bit of the contents on the back of the candy bar or item that you are about to eat because if is produced in a peanut factory do not eat it still.

   Final food question : who makes the best cakes in your area?
  ","
  There's this Bakery down the road and they're reeeally good at making cake. I think I have a picture of a cake they made...it looked so good but I'm not a blueberry eating type of person? unless it's like candy? or a blueberry muffin? and honestly I don't really like blueberry muffins either?.. like my taste buds can't handle extremely straight sweet tastes. So I can't stand banana tastes even though that's not really sweet? I cannot eat cherries... I'm not a pie fruit pie type person... I like dessert pies! No fruit in my pies. No.
  
  But yeah I like to eat blueberries though especially Frozen but like in a cake form? No. Can I not stand it? No. I can eat it, but I don't prefer it.
  
  Here's the photo.
  
  Back home in Louisiana I have dozens and dozens of people that can make cakes including my own family members.
  
  I am a baker... but I don't focus on cakes a lot? I can make pies, cookies, brownies... But Cakes? Not really. But 100% I can decorate the hell out of a cake though.
  
  But yeah this Bakery down the road... Well they are in town but yeah... they rock and this is going to sound nasty what I am about to tell you.. but it's. not! until you try it?!...... chocolate. covered. bacon! SOO ? GOOD and then chocolate covered bacon with nuts on them! Pecans! and they make like chocolate covered pretzels
  
  they have pastries they have casseroles they cater, can you tell? different cakes, cupcakes.

   Have you ever been out to Long Beach and aboard the Queen Mary? We stayed there about 5 years ago for my birthday and I did the midnight haunted tour. While nothing happened on our tour the stories the guide shared with us gave me the Willy’s!
  ","
  I have done a lot of research on the Queen Mary and I really want to go and visit there's a few rooms that you stay in that are really crazy.
  
  Room B340 is crazy...
  
  With box filled with different types of things to meddle with while staying there. Different ghost stories written all over the beams and walls including a bloody mary ritual in the bathroom written on the wall.
  
  Other complaints when staying in the room... the bathroom lights turning on by themselves... the sink faucet turning on and off on its own... and unexplained bathroom doors shutting. Some folks have reported the covers of their bed being pulled off while asleep and waking to see a dark figure standing at the foot of the bed. Scratching on the walls. There's a closet in there and the clothes like to move around alot. ( bathrobes)
  
  Though that's not the most haunted part of the entire building nor it's not the only haunted part... there's many hallways and sections of the boat were lots of figures have been seen. Voices have been heard items have moved around. There's a pool area where a story a little girl drowned. They don't even really let people over there. And there's hundreds of other incidences and there's thousands of other places in the place where things have happened.
  
  This is just some but I would love to go and visit there's tons of rooms where you can stay that are kinda haunted. But room B340 is definitely one of the highlights.

  ","
  Well they're not everywhere. And sometimes you have to study it for a little while to catch signs. A lot of times It's Not What It Seems. Sometimes it just seems like it's something else if we ignore it. I mean sometimes I think that when I see something but when I'm looking around and thinking about it there's no possible way you could be anything but just paranormal. It can't just happen to anyone and honestly I wouldn't make it happen to you. It will happen one day. It doesn't happen to everybody. It's very possible for someone to go on in their life and never ever experienced anything paranormal. Because it's not normal and it's not something that happens all the time.

I feel dirty. Please help
  ","
  Don't feel dirty??? To be pregnant is a blessing. And just revert to classes and advice from other adults and have kids and you'll be fine.
  
  If anything, if you don't feel like you can take care of the child, you can always put them up for adoption. That's a pretty understandable reason? If you can't take care of somebody, then provide a family that can't have children with a child is a blessing also.
  
  I wouldn't judge someone for something like. I mean of course we all make mistakes? but at the end of the day? today is today and we have to make a choice this for today.

  Nope. That's one thing I always try to be is an extremely open-minded person and try to make everyone feel comfortable when they're around me. I was always complimented in school because I stuck up for the kids that would get bullied. No matter if they were in the wrong or not. There's no reason to be picking on other people for no reason.
  
  I don't judge anyone by sexual orientation, race, religion, their traditions, culture, political views, choices, personal beliefs, where they are from. I try not to judge anyone by anything. As long as people have morals think before they do things think before they speak learn respect have respect and are still open to constructive criticism.

   May I ask why do you consider someone asking you're age violating?
  ","
  I usually can tell when people are asking that question for certian reasons.
  
  It maybe not be more or less violating... I probably could have used a different term or phrase but it more or less ...being none of their business.
  
  They're random strangers. We don't lnow eachother at? People on the internet. It repetitive... It's always the same this... Where ya from? What's your age? And then it escalates from there because I'm giving them personal info...
  
  People don't read biographies. Or if their intentions are to have a relationship their first question should be are you single or just read biographies?! Observe a few pictures and posts. You can find out a lot about a person before asking all these questions? That's the logical way of going about things?
  
  Most of the time people do see that I'm married and yet they still try to home wreck and try to ask all these personal questions when it's absolutely none of their business but myself and the people around me, person i am married to. They ask where I live... what's my age... if I'm near them... if it's a place that they're maybe be going to one day and that they're interested in going to...how tall am I? what are my interests... All personal questions? Like really?! How tall??? Why does a person on the internet need to know my height? Balls down to wanting to picture what I look like... Want to see and meet me...When I'm clearly not interested in anyone because I'm married? I am not leading on? I put it in my bio? Ask me? Then they get mad when I'm honest and I'm like look.. I'm married. Can we be friends or something? Talk? Buds? Nothing wrong with that???
  
  Honestly what I'm saying is... I'm tired of the same disrespectful repetitive questions from creeps on the internet so I just choose not to tell people on the internet how old I am and personal information. Make sense? Sorry if I seem to offend anyone.

   Why do most guys think that girls would be interested in their dick pics?
  ","
  Because there is a percentage of screwed up, fucked girls in this world who make these dudes think that they need to bring more wood up in the bedroom when they only provide what the hell they were born with? See.. Our bodies? They are temples. They really are. I know this sounds like some grade one tyoe answer, corny bs... But we are important... Bodiesaare to be respected? And being focused on a thing that honestly just makes ya, to me? look lower.. less perfect? They be keeping POINTS?! 10 guys 20 guys! 35?! 40?! 60?! THAT SOUNDS GROSS. Treatment at the docter if you'd ask me... And a nasty reputation. Probably get physically hurt in the end... All not worth it.. Bad path in all.
  
  Wish the world would focus on the things that actually are important... like having a job? being healthy? morals? priorities? who knows?!

  I would ride down to Louisiana with my husband and with my dogs and spend my last hours with my entire family.
  
  Right before I got to Louisiana I would go to a dog shelter and visit a lot of animals before I went to my moms. Love animals.
  
  With my family, would go and meet Avril Lavigne just once. Let her know I've been a fan of her since I was about five years old. Tell her she was my idol in life. Tell her thank you.
  
  Meet Adam Levine and thank him for paying for Christina Grimmie's funeral. Go down to Christina Grimmie's grave and put flowers on it because that was my idol in life along with Avril.
  
  I would go down in my paw paw's grave and put flowers next to it and tell him I love him. Thank him.
  
  Then I would go out of my guardian angel's grave I was named after her and put flowers on her grave. In which to get to her you have to take a ferry ride and go up the hill to get to her.
  
  I would go to where I grew up with my friends and family and walk the streets and go play 1 baseball game out in the field, run the bases that aren't there anymore just one more time.
  
  I would go in my old church where I grew up in. I used to lead the Church in singing all the time for years. I loved it. I would sing a song all alone and then go and lay on the floor and I would die. ❤ I had a good life. Still do and appreciate every second of it. No matter how tough it gets. I have a an adventurous life. ?

  Any type of sexual questions an extremely personal questions. Questions on beliefs, politics, sexual orientation.
  
  I believe people should like whoever they want whenever they want as long as you're not hurting you I don't see the problem.
  
  I think people should believe whatever religion or God or Saviour they want, I don't think there's a problem with it as long as you're not hurting anyone.
  
  I think people don't need to be questioned about the color of the skin or how tall or how fat are how skinny they are.
  
  I don't think people need to be judged on where they're from just because of stereotypes and things that have happened from where they're from I think people need to be judged on what they are today ( get to know people 1st.)
  
  (Keep in mind history yes and be carefuo with your choices. Notice red flags and protect yourself. Don't go at things alone.)
  
  I believe people should have the choice to talk about certain things within their country or they don't have to. (politics)
  
  I don't think anybody should have to do anything they don't want to as long as they're not hurting anybody I don't see the problem.
  
  Have morals and good judgment protect yourself that's what I say.

   What questions do you really dislike receiving?
  ","
  Aren't really questions but like people just randomly cursing me out that I don't know??? That I have never talked to before?
  
  People TELLING me to follow them. I am okay with like.. ""Hey, I followed you, can you follow me back?"" Pleases and thank yous beung politely. Maybe follow? Those are okay. I'm fine with that.. But like people being like this I don't like. ""WHY HAVEN'T YOU FOLLOWED ME?"" ""I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING?!"" Like basicly asking me why I unfollowed them? For one if you're not active? I'm going to unfollow you. Two, if you ask really personal, perverted, annoying questions. Like questions that you don't need know? I'm going to unfollow you! If you ask too many questions or just demanding sentences I'm going unfollow you! Be classy not trashy and be polite and I won't be followed to you as long as you're cool, chill, nice and active.
  
  I don't like answering questions about age and location because those things are not important for anybody on this social media site to know, because I don't know any of you personally.
  
  Sometimes people are just curious about age and I'm fine with that, but a lot of people want to know my age because they're interested in me. I am married and am not looking for anyone.. I am hapoy where I am at and who I am with. That's why I married him. Marriage is not know when I'm with me. I'm very traditional with families and marriage.
  
  The reason why I don't like it when people want to know where I exactly live.. and it's okay to ask me like what country? what state? what's my culture or something? But not like.. my city or town or address. No. Cuz if you show up to my house I promise you.. you're not going to want to have a six and a half foot tall, 7ft tall redneck, bodybuilt, tattedman answer the door to you.. Cause it won't be good..

  Your not gonna believe this but on Xbox 360 on Grand Theft Auto V. On a video gaming console. Met him in unexpectedly in plaza on there. In a Blue clean Karien Rebel. (Rare) A truck on the game. But yeah... ? 5 years ago.
  
  I am from Louisiana and he is from Mississippi. Didn't expect to meet him online. Fell for him. ? He had all his priorities straight it seemed. That's what I liked about him. Seemed like a protector. Kinda like a bad boy? Haha. But he's a great man! He is good to me! He is very smart and talented. Skillful. He is vary big and tall and strong. Knows what's important and knowz how to keep it all safe! I love him for that. He has an amazing personality and is really sweet. Tall, tatted, bearded man. ❤ He is wonderful. Extremely collected and respectful.
  
  We were in a long distance relationship visiting each other back and forth, for years. For about 4 1/2 years. Took us forever to be together for good. Atm... We are working on getting a house. We are married! ?? Have 2 pups. Want more and kids one day!

  I was shopping at a local store and their computer decided to glitch and charge me before the end of the transaction. It like glitched? So it technically not paid for but was paid for but it was in the process of refunding us. So we couldn't get our stuff because it already charged us and we didn't like have enough money until the next day on the card so we spent two hours in that store getting all that stuff and got up front for the computer to glitch... Yup. Ask for a manager and they said there was nothing we could do about it even though it was their computer issue. They couldn't like get our stuff. They wouldn't even let us like come back and pay for it another day, no.

  You should fry ya some fresh shrimp with some Zatarain's fish fry. (do not season the shrimp again thd cry is pre-seasoned. Unless you want it hotter) Then a little bit of pepper and tony chachere's, sprinkle that on there, then add just a thin add of butter, the toast the bread. You want to use some po-boy bread maybe with some sesame seeds on top if you like that. Toast that with the seasoning and butter..
  
  Then get ya some lettuce, a really thin cut tomato off of choice or two.. Then add ya some tartar sauce. No cheese. You can add but it will take away from the taste of all the other food. Don't add cheese the 1st time.
  
  Then some homemade chips off of a potatoes! Yum!

  My favorite restaurant in the world is probably Ryan's and it's a buffet.
  
  This is a really old place. It's a buffet. I love eating here. I've had some of my birthday's here. They serve like homemade foods. Like rice and gravy. Red beans and rice. Pizza. Mashed potatoes. Chicken nuggets. Steak. Pork. Fried foods. Green beans. Beans. Desserts. Fruit. Pulled pork. Hamburgers. Sausage. Macaroni and cheese. Spaghetti.
  
  Regluar American foods.
  
  And of course when you gets the table they have free buttery hot bread for an appetizer.
  
  My favorite thing to get there would probably have to be red beans and rice sausage green beans.. macaroni and cheese and then maybe a piece of fried chicken or pork. And then of course we get fruits and vegetables and desserts and nuts or cake. Have you ever heard of goldencorral it's very closely related to that place but now Ryan's is slowly going out of business everywhere.
  
  Two other places I like eating at is Shoney's it's very old school and then another place is a place called Waffle House
  
  If you've never heard of Shoney's Shoney's is a breakfast and lunch buffet
  
  And sometimes I would get chicken nuggets and sometimes I would get like grits sausage bacon eggs it just depends on what I wanted that day
  
  Add Waffle House I like to get omelettes grits sausage
  
  I like to go to a restaurant called Oshi
  
  I like to order a Hibachi Sushi and different types of Bento boxes from here
  
  I like to go to Texas Roadhouse and Outback and Order different things like shrimps and lobster and steak
  
  I love eating Chinese I usually get crab cakes the noodles with like teriyaki on it broccoli shrimp crab sushi salmon some Chinese chicken nuggets Chinese rice crawfish baked fish baked potatoes pieces.

  So.. down here in the south in south Louisiana we celebrate a thing called Mardi Gras' and during a parade down in New Orleans I was standing on the side of the road catching beads and some fellos came walking down with roses and was giving them out selectively. And one came up to me handed it to me, kissed me on the cheek and then walked away. Xd LOL I found that funny, random and kind of strange... but! apparently that's what they do down here at some of the New Orleans parades. I am from Louisiana but, that was just the first time I've ever had THAT happen to me. LOL. Hahahaa

   Like you have been seeing them for two months and things are going well. But the friend hasn't gotten in the way. But your significant other feels threatened by them
  ","
  So you were talking about yourself correct? You are dating somebody correct? And your significant other that you just started dating is threatened by a friend of yours or X?  for one if it's an X if your significant other has a problem with you talking to them then you probably should just call it off with the X because obviously the person you're doing now is more important than them & you should show that.
  
  If it's not an ex & it's just a friend that you are speaking of and you've been friends with them for a while. If they're not doing anything wrong to your significant other, than I don't see the problem with you talking to them, still today. & if they're just jealous.. like your significant other is jealous of your friend then that's not right. Like if they are jealous in the way thay they are just the opposite sex & you are they're friend. They need to let you have friends.. Even if the opposite sex. They need to learn to trust you. That's hiw relationships work? Constant trust & communication is key..
  
  but if your significant other is scared because your friend is threatening them... then that friend is not a friend. Your friend should make your significant other feel threatened. Under any circumstances... No other human should make another human feel threatened.
  
  I have been with my husband for 6-years, we are married and we both have friends of both sexes. Trust.
  
  But you also have to put in the work to make your significant other know that nothing is going to happen between you & your friend when hanging out with your friend & your friend needs to respect the fact that your significant other is more important to you because obviously they are your significant other.
  
  This is how life works. If your firend doesn't get it. ? you then give them the ultimatum.
  
  But your friend could be looking out for you too in the long run. Make sure that the person that you are with is right for you. They're not doing you wrong. Treating you right. That is important.

  What love is to me could mean something different for someone else, so what I'm about to say may not be what you or someone else me think love is.
  
  Current love for one is one thing that this world is lacking. They lack the ability to love. Nobody has the patience for it anymore. To actually love somebody. Love takes patience. Patience takes love!
  
  It's so confusing to explain statistics of what I feel love is.
  
  So I did a little bit of research to find someone that could explain the way that I would and here is the image I took this image and I recreated it in an editor and I gave the person credit who said it.
  
  Josh Dove* well said.

   What was the fantastic romantic movie you watching  ?
  ","
  I don't understand
  "
56620,"
   How
  ","
  Just saying, ""give me coins,"" is a demand. In which people do not find nice behavior. To give is choice from people. If you ask for people to give... they don't have to do so in the first place...because when giving, the other person is not supposed to expect. So you asking for me to ""give"" is a demanding an action. That is not polite. Is rude. Most people avoid that. Try to be more polite and people will give more even when you don't ask.

  Idk?
  
  I'm a very funny, but sometimes very strange, a very social Cajun French girl from south Louisiana. But I love to bring ppeoples spirits up. I enjoyed gaming, painting and singing. I have been singing since I was about 6 or 7 years old and I love to do that that's probably my favorite hobby. I have been researching the Paranormal since I was about 9 years old. I love traveling. I'm very adventurous. I love diff cultures and traditions. I try to stay very open-minded. I don't judge people from where they're from. I don't judge people from their past. I don't care what kind of religion you like. I care about you and who you are. I respect all of the above about person. As long as they respect that the same. I like geography meteorology and photography. ✌ This is me.

Trips to Louisiana, to see my family. I like to get accessories for our guns. I like to get things to add onto the truck. Love to antique shop. We like to collect knives and hats so sometimes when we see knives and hats will get one. There's a lot of things that I like to spend my money on but I choose not to.

   Why does society place such a high value on beauty when it serves no functional purpose?

  Who knows? Sometimes I wonder the same.
  
  Maybe because some of these people are desperate horny little b--tards and they can't catch no kinda piece of women so... they have to seriously sit here and pay for it. And then you really got the extremely sick b--tards that like young girls.
  
  All men have to do is just be themselves? know their priorities and know what's important and protected it!
  
  Then a woman would want you?! Keep your hygiene up. Be clean. We hmwant you to have respect for yourself!? Have a little bit of self-esteem and confidence. Hard workers. Just care. And you will catch some kind've a women!

  ","
  Maybe a wreath for like Christmas or a ornament that is describing the way that someone looks in a funny, cute way. They have tons of ornaments at different types of stores and markets that you can look through. Making an ornament is really cute. Getting someone table mats for their table or maybe for their door, depending on what season you're in. You know Matt's for your plates on your table?
  
  Kitchen towels depending on the season like a Santa Claus Christmas towel or hand mittens for cooking.
  
  Wind chimes and dream catchers are good gifts to get people in the fall I feel like.
  
  Getting them different types of presents with like leaves and pumpkins and food on it because of Thanksgiving.
  
  For the Fourth of July in the summer you get them like positive quotes and like fishing quotes like decorations you put around your house and on night tables.
  
  For Halloween you can get tons of different types of things to put in their yard. I know that there's soap dispensers that are in the shape of like pumpkins and Halloween black cats. Really cute.

  Malaysia because I've heard it's a beautiful country. Very few friends there, but would love to visit them!  doing sit on a couple of their beaches. Attractions.
  
  I have friends in Australia and I love gem Mining and I'd love to do some of that there too. There's a couple of attractions I want to visit. I want to go snorkeling.
  
  And then I want to go to Germany because I have a few friends that live there also and I would like to visit a bunch of tourist attractions.
  
  As long as it wouldn't be too dangerous and it was possible, I would actually want to go and jump on the moon. I know this is weird but my Paw paw has always talked about the moon and I feel like I would be going in his favor. I'm kinda scared of space. But I like to face alot of my fears or at least try. I'd go for the experience of course, but as well for him. Because always wanted to go to moon.

  I treat them like I do everyone else and help them and am nice.. But theu are so mean to me.. For no reason. Idk?
  
  I stress thay they will just keep coming back..
  
  My work and my boss said that they're going to ban her if she keeps it up.
  
  I'm not exactly ""scared"" of her.. But it is my job? I don't want to be aggravated up there or anything. And she does it infont of my other customers and makes me look really bad. Lies and stuff.. Annoying more than anything. Cause I am very fair and nice to people. I do not cause any problems. Don't want any problems. Idk?? Hopefully it stops soon.

   Whats Halloween festival..?
  ","
  I don't know exactly what Halloween festival is but Halloween...
  
  Traditionally known as All Hallows’ Evening, Halloween falls on 31 October. It is always the eve of Christian festival All Saints’ Day on 1 November.
  
  Dating back to European traditions, Halloween originated from the ancient Gaelic festival, Samhain. It was a day to celebrate the end of the harvest season – it means “summer's end”.
  
  It is thought that the Pagan Samhain was Christianised into Halloween by the early Christian church, and modern day customs have their roots in early folklore, Pagan beliefs and early Christianity.
  
  The word Halloween itself is a Scottish term for All Hallows Eve - basically, the evening before All Saints' Day.
  
  Historically Gaels thought the walls between the spiritual realm and our world were thin. In order to protect their crops, they would set up places at their dinner tables for good spirits and light bonfires to scare off evil spirits.
  
  Trick or treating and dressing up came from 16thCentury Ireland, Scotland and Wales. People would ask for food in exchange for a poem or song. People dressed up in scary costumes and impersonated the souls of the dead to protect themselves.

I would buy a white girl Pitbull like he wants. So my boy dog has a girlfriend. I would buy my husband a blacksmithing station. Wood station also. Nice shed. I would make sure the house is perfect with a nice kitchen and master bathroom a rain shower inside and outside. Good size yard with flower beds and fencing magnolia trees and rose bushes everywhere.
  
  Own a pond... Alot. I would do alot..
  
  I would donate to the Wounded Warriors Project and I would donate to st. Jude's. I would probably start some sort of a food bank to feed poor folks in my area.

   Is a life that focuses on avoiding pain and seeking out pleasure a good and worthwhile life? Why or why not?
  ","
  To me and my opinion I feel like that's not a good life because you're not really getting anywhere...
  
  If you're referring to having some sort of a situation happened to you and then giving up on trying and then just running around and seeing whoever whenever and thinking that that's happy is not.
  
  I can set you into a path of disaster and have it it can affect your health and long run both mentally and physically.
  
  I say if I'm right about what I'm talkin about take a break for a while and don't do any of the above a focus on yourself gain skills and hobbies go out and do stuff even if it's with someone or without someone.
  
  It's hard to break the Habit. You don't always need somebody in your life. You can be alone, independent and by yourself and be happy.

   What makes someone attractive?
  ","
  Showing their true selves and being funny. Seeing someone do something so caring for someone that they don't even know. It shows the morals. If they could take care of a random person then you know for sure that they would take care of you.
  
  Another thing that I find attractive in someone is when they are so confident and they show it. It almost brings confidence to yourself and positivity.
  
  Hygiene. Going to say someone eating healthy or taking care of themselves constantly I find that attractive. I want them to take care of themselves if they can take care of themselves they will take care of you.
  
  Seeing someone be kind to animals.
  
  And when someone has their priorities straight.

   Have you ever written a song?
  ","
  Yeah awhile back. I wrote a whole CD with a buddy of mine from Sacramento, California. It was great music. I helped him write a lot of the lyrics I was so far away from him that I wasn't able to sing the music with him and record but I made the disks and the album but was only a few CDs out.
  
  It was really good music. Sadly he's grown up and changed and we don't talk anymore sadly. I enjoyed writing music with him a lot.

   What did you do today?
  ","
  I cooked some food.
  
  I cleaned all day mostly.
  
  Swept and mopped
  
  Did clothes and dishes
  
  I fed my dogs, twice
  
  I walked them a couple of times around the yard
  
  I let my dog, my son watch some dog TV for a few hours while I cleaned and he loved it.
  
  My other Pitbull almost got attacked by a black widow and I luckly saw it and macked it off of her. I don't think it bit her and I immediately applied alcohol to wear the area I saw it land on her at. So I think that she's okay I inspected her. She's acting all right drinking water good and eating. She's an old girl.
  
  Then I made some cookies for mu husband. He'll be happy when he comes in from work.
  
  And now I'm defrosting some chicken tenders that I'm going to fry with some french fries and he's probably going to love that too. And then I'm going to make him some lunch for tomorrow.
  
  At the moment I'm watching a YouTuber, one of my most favorite YouTubers, Moe sargi on. About to go get started on cooking in a sec.

   Any upcoming travels?
  ","
  We really want to go to Tennessee and visit Ruby Falls and Rock City. That's where my husband wants to take me. Then he wants to take me to some other really awesome place that has caves and stuff.
  
  And then he wants to take me to if you museums and then we want to visit the Bass Pro Shops pyramid and stay there.
  
  We want to go to Missouri the start of all Bass Pro Shops and the biggest Bass Pro Shops in the United States of America and the world. We want to go there and stay there for a few days and then we may go to St Louis.
  
  I want to go and visit a few rock mining places. We're going to one and Arkansas's one Georgia and the other in South Carolina.
  
  I want to go visit a few places where GTA was designed at in California.
  
  I want to take my husband to Pensacola Florida and show him a few of the Naval bases they have there.
  
  Then I want to take him to New Orleans to go to the aquarium and Zoo( it's huge) (i love going to the zoo) because he really wants to go to the aquarium in New Orleans it is really good. They have really good War museums in it a great and Insectarium.
  
  There was a few other places I would like to bring him and there's a few other places that he would like to bring me but these are the highlights of what we want to do. We love to travel I hope to travel from one side of the United States of America to the other before we die.
  
  We met through travels. We used to be in a long distance relationship and used to have to constantly go back and forth miles and miles to visit each other. To the road is where we met. Met through GTA.
  
  We're together and married now.

  ","
  Oh
  
  I've had many things happen.
  
  Since I research it. More down things happen to me, visiting places. I have seen things. I've had doors open and shut. I've had lights come off and on. I've seen apparitions and dark figures and white figures. I have had people see the same thing I was seeing. We have heard groups of people talking, people singing, people having discussions with others and they're not there. I've seen things get picked up and dropped. I've seen things get thrown. I've had positive entities communicate with me and I've had some negative try to come through, but I do not allow the negative one's to talk to me, I pray and wish them away and demand them to not follow or talk to me. I have actually communicated with people from the outside world. I have had way more. This is just some. I do it all out of interest and curiosity and respect I do not do it out of disrespect or in an evil way. I do it in a good way.
  
  This is all real encounters that me and people around me have encountered. This is not untrue stories. Or it's things that I have seen in researching.

To understand it .

  It's really hard to understand when one word means more than another.
  
  It's like slang...
  
  Slang is with every language.
  
  Slang is when you are used to the different words.
  
  Like... It is hard to explain..
  
  You have to be used to the lanugage that you are speaking to understand when one word means more than another.
  
  What I am saying... Is it maybe hard for you to learn that. Over time when learning English or any language for that matter, you will learn that.
  
  I can try to get you to understand that... But it's like with your language that you speak. I would be hard for me to understand in your language the levels to which each word means.
  
  We are all like that. That is a hard skill to learn. It is possible. Years of practice of fluently speaking that language.

  It wasn't anything about me really. It was me getting a little frustrated with the fact that someone I know doesn't get enough support from the people around them.

They have no self esteem if people keep just being negative all the time around them. They don't have the confidence. Nothing?
  
  That aggravates me.
  
  Teach them.
  
  Help them.
  
  Then add constructive criticism and then still try to teach them and help them improve. Don't keep breaking them down when you're not doing anything to try to help??

  A couple of hurricanes.
  
  When Christina Grimmie was murdered. She is my idol and is an amazing singer. If you've never heard of her look her up she is a angel. She is super kind and is an amazing person. She was known on YouTube a Zelda love. She was known on The Voice.
  
  Getting married. It was one of the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. He is very good to me and I'm happy to call him my husband.
  
  When finding out my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and Dementia. She has a lot of other problems too and I feel bad... she is a sweet person and has devoted her entire life to volunteering into feeding the poor and she has this now it's sad that it happens to the best. I'm trying to spend as much time as I can with her before she goes. I hope that I can keep her for as long as I can.

I could eat and be healthy and I am healthy and everything but I cannot give blood. Last time I gave blood. I think I almost had to go to the ER. It was really scary and I would like to never ever experienced it ever again unless I am in the hospital. That way if something was to happen I would already be there.

  I do not like it when people touch me whether I know them or not unless it's immediate family are my husband. I believe people can have conversation and verbally do it that way not physically.. I don't believe that you have to touch someone? Ya know what I mean. Lol that's obvious but.. I have literally had random people get waaay too close, up in my face.. grabbing my hair... grabbing my arm.. touching my back?! (May I remind you... RANDOM PEOPLE) hugging me when I do not give them the consent to... kissing me?! Like.. Quick come in on me kisses on the cheek and yeah... when I do not give them the consent to... Follow me.. Stalk me... Threaten me... Attack.... ? Yeah... No stories here... All have sadly happened to me. I do not ask for pitty. I ask for people to not get into the same sistuations. I grew up in a dangerous area in Louisiana.

   Your favorite book ?
  ","
  I actually don't read that much.  I have a lot of trouble reading oh, I was diagnosed at a young age with really bad dyslexia. But yet, that never stopped me from reading. I really like reading historical books and things on events that happened in the past. One of my favorite books is Where the Red Fern Grows. I also like reading about the Holocaust and people's perspectives. I like reading books on weather, paranormal stories geography, and historical events. Many times when I get a hold of a book I usually have an audio that usually reads it to me as I follow along in the book. I can read. It's just a disability that I have. I have problems pronouncing things. I have issues understanding and comprehension. Spelling. It takes longer for me to learn things, but yeah there's a few things on books with me

  You mean... like.. kind've go-with-the-flow? I Believe in that kind of a phrase like taking life with one grain at a time, dmday by day. Things happen for a reason. So I guess I believe in that phrase that you were saying in the question.

  :THIS IS RECENT:
  
  But we just recently sold the house that I grew up in and it wasnt just the place I grew up in but tons and tons of family and friends grew up in. We didn't expect that to happen but it did. I don't really want to go into too much detail on that because it is really sad.
  
  :KINDA RECENT:
  
  Getting married was pretty awesome. Sometimes I still look at him and say hey we're married! Husband! Haha. Could ya believe that?! and it was all the way in September when we got married. Haha. And he looks at me like LOL yeah right????!
  
  :RECENT:
  
  And then recently one of my good friends committed suicide. He shot himself... No one knew that there was coming? I guess he just wasn't happy? and didn't really want to talk to anyone about? Idk??
  
  That was crazy but was something that I had to open my eyes to... the realization in it that he's gone. And that he was 100% fine just the other day. Yea kno?? It's sad. But I'm okay.
  
  When Christina Grimmie was murdered down in Orlando at her fan meet-up that was really hard to taken I still mourn today. If you don't know what I'm talkin about you can actually look that incident it up online. It was actually pretty popular incident. It happened around the time that the gay club got shot up in the same area in Orlando Florida. That was reeeally sad too. May God rest their souls. It was alot of people. I think inside and outside the club. Sad...
  
  My grandfather passing that was really hard to take in.
  
  Alot of sad. Sorry!!
  "
57737,"
   Should the things you’ve done in the past always contribute to how people view you today? Why or why not?
  ","
  No. Because we are constantly running into new people every single day. It's not like you have to announce everything that you've done in your past cuz half the time everyone hasn't even done anything that really bad of stuff to announce. But if you're like a sex offender or something of course with the law you have to... by law* say that you are that until whatever date that you're allowed to not have to say it anymore.
  
  Because of course I'm people are wrongly accused and haven't even done the things that they're convicted of. There is some instances where people haven't done the things that they were charged for it and stuff.
  
  But like ya know... For example... if you were like 5 years old? and stole a piece of bubblegum from the store and then you're supposed to tell everybody that? No... No.. Or even a candy bar or 2? Anything at that age. Even at 10?
  
  Even when you are grown really but with age you should know better but people shouldn't judge you by yesterday. They should judge you by today.
  
  Or maybe they beat someone up? Maybe tjey had a reason? Maybe they were protecting? Maybe they were just mad? We all get mad? We all have our moments? I know I do. But control.
  
  I have met people that have killed multiple people and they turn their lives around completely. And then I've met some people that have done things similar and they haven't turned their lives around and most of them are in jail and I really haven't met any of those kinds of people because they are where they are. But doesn't mean even that I am gonna judge them even when they are in contempt wrong, because they are in the process of turning their lives around. You never really know the minds of people. Their morals, choice and reason. We don't know?
  
  I try to remain open minded with everything. But keep to myself unless needed. Just be careful with what I say and do. Keep others around me safe ya know?
  
  I hope that I answered this question right. I hope a little. Haha. ?✌
  "
57738,"
   What is a secret you're not supposed to know and could ruin your life?
  ","
  Idk.
  
  Maybe if someone did something really bad and it was like a law bad type of thing... and if I was to get told and then forced to not say anything and was then threatened that multiple people would come after me if I was to tell peope. Then that kind of secret....
  
  That's why it's good to not affiliated with those types of people, situations. That's why it's good to make sure that you don't hang out with influential people, negative people. You want positive environments. Never put yourself into bad matters. Where you have to sell or own people stuff. No. Do not. I don't care if you have to live in a box. You will be happier. I would instead of living life where your constantly havung to hide and run all the time?? Cuz sometimes those types of people will not just hurt you but other people around you and that's when it gets really dangerous..

   Have you ever been taken by a con artist and how did you deal with it?
  ","
  I have had someone try to con me before yes. Many different times especially one situation where a dude walked in the middle of the highway and was knocking on my window and that was probably... Just was really scary. I felt concern for the random stranger because he was just walking in front of traffic in the middle of the highway.
  
  But like do you mean kidnapped by one or something?? No. Not by a con man, person, but! I was almost kidnapped when I was 8 years old in the front yard of my grandma's house.
  
  I don't care how many people get aggravated of an Amber Alerts... I have experienced almost being kidnapped and if anyone ever gets aggravated Amber Alerts they can shut their butts up because I was almost that kid one time... That was me almost! Taken! Gone! 2 seconds. That's all it takes. And he walked uo in the yard and everything! Was gonna pick me up and take me. I was a smart 8 year old for running. Oh did I run??? I yelled and ran... Scared to death.
  
  Anytime I get an amber alert I cry because I just remember that day... and I feel so bad for the kids that are going through that.
  
  Also anytime I see an amber alert I tried to look out for the vehicles or whatever it says on the alert and if I see a post on Facebook or on any social media, I share it.
  
  Alot of the kids are just people in general! Because people! Grown people will go missing. It's so sad. Some are recovered and for the few that aren't. May God bless their souls. ?

  They call it fire, also called or known for being called coins. I like to refer it to x.com currency though is not actual money or worth anything besides just virtual points.
  
  This is the symbol for it ""?"".
  
  It is awards.
  
  Fire is important to get and keep and give out only when you maybe think a answer is BRILLIANT! Reeally really good. It's to boost peoples accounts. All of our accounts are ranked based off of the amount of likes and ? you earn or at least I think I am explaining this correctly to you.
  
  You can distribute multiple coins to one question it's underneath the answer a question that people post on their page.
  
  If someone was to give you three then you could go on their page and read their stuff and give them a few. Usually when people award me I tried to award them back.
  
  I call it common courtesy.
  
  I don't beg for coins but if people give them then I'm more than welcome and appreciative. The number at the top of your profile next to your name is your rank in your country, but if there is no number then your rank is too low. I think that you have to be a hundred or under to have a number next to it like on my profile on number 16 right now I believe in my country. I think that's how it works. It may have dropped and that's okay. I don't really take it too seriously and I'm not really competitive about it either.

   Why do people give up so easily on relationships nowadays? Are we becoming more and more selfish?
  ","
  Now that you mention it absolutely. Feel like that's how relationships should be looked at as a way of being selfless and caring for another individual unlike yourself for once.
  
  People are constantly not getting their way in a relationship and so they are hopping from one relationship to another because they think that the relationship is not worth it when really you're not putting in enough time and patience to even try to make the relationship work. If you see that something is clicking with the person then obviously try to make it work don't sit there and pop from one person to another and then when you get to a good guy or girl, do the same thing to them just because you're used to the habit. Don't hurt a person that is seriously looking for another companion's feeling's just because you're wanting to play games and can't figure out what the fks you want?!  it honestly disgusts me.

57759,"
   Well be careful! You know it’s hard to know what you’re really up against when you encounter something bad.
  ","
  I'll trust me I'm armored with God and don't allow any negativity to converse with me when on the explorations when they come up I demand them to go away and to not follow. When you are not showing any signs of fear which is what negative Spirits feed off of is the weak, if you don't show signs of fear then they will not bother you. They want to manipulate that. They want to be the inferior. If they don't see a chance then they don't usually bother.

   Me too! But it also freaks me the f out. I had to cut way back on watching all those shows cause I was having crazy dreams for awhile. ? But I just find it so facinating! I lived in Salem, MA for a few years before moving here. You should def visit there one day
  ","
  I would love to go and visit there. I have done so much research on that place. But I have literally been researching the Paranormal for over a decade now.. around about thirteen years. Have been on many adventures and Explorations and I've been countered many different things. I have communicated with the afterlife. I have seen stuff. I have heard things. I've encountered good spirits and I've encountered bad spirits. I've heard doors slam. Have had doors closed on their own. I've heard speaking in footsteps. I have seen things in the corner of my eye. I have seen things get picked up and dropped. and so much more... I respect the history on a lot of things for a reason.
  
  And people believe it's all people on drugs and their crazy but no I have prove! And have had people with me that saw and heard and experienced what I was! And the freaking out part does it really affect me. I used to get pretty overwhelmed and I kind of still do but I'm just been dealing with it so long and been researching it so long it's just another thing to me.

  Oooooh you are asking what kinda music do I write.. Ohhh ignore my answers...
  
  I mean I do like to write like alternative rock type stuff. I write slightly dark things but it's like truthful dark things that happen in people's lives and then I write about paranormal stuff. Spiritual things and missing people get passed on. because I deeply understand it I've researched it for years it's just something really deep that I know about. I mean I usually just sing covers. Like things that other people have written. I don't like a lot of music but if I did that's what I would write about. I like to rap. Like to sing really pretty songs. Thoughtful stuff and positive stuff too. Like things that build people up.

I mean you can always buy a piece of shoot vehicle oooor... help someone else work on their vehicle and just make sure that they call you over whenever they work on it and make sure they explain absolutely every single thing to you and then you recite it back to them and then have them do it and then you do it. And then recited again.

  It's not too hard to start. You just have to get you a vehicle and learn everything about it and then work on it. Start with little easy stuff. That's how I started off with working on vehicles. Then watch a few videos on YouTube or something and you'll start understand the stuff.
  
  I'm sure you know some stuff about cars I'm just saying this is how you could like learn more.

  No. Not regularly. Alot of the Churches here where I moved are all just about money. Down in Louisiana I used to go to a private school.

Loved it.

  Right.
  
  He's a wonderful person.
  
  And all of the people uo at the jail love him. All of them.
  
  He doesn't judge the guys in there. Some of them are in there of stupid sh-. Little petty crap. Some are in there for reasons... But they are learnung and are turning their lives around. I try to be fair with all myself. I don't try to rely on the past. I live for today.
  
  But yes... The best people get taken from this world and I ain't going unless I have to. I protect him and myself and everyone around me so that what I said above doesn't happen. I am both respectful and responsible with what I do and say. ❤ I do it all outta love. That's what the hell this world is missing now.
  
  Morals are going away.
  
  No one ain't thinking before they do. And like I said it's sad.
  
  I love his job. It makes me feel safe. And he loves it. He gets to help people. Crazy enough. That's helping people. And I am proud of him.
  "
57789,"
   ok does he carry a gun
  ","
  He doesn't have to. Correctional officers work usually inside of the jails. They're the ones that take care of the inmates in the county/city jail. Book them in and out. Correct their behavior, when they're beimg loud or having fights. He feeds them and cleans up after them. He gives them showers then checks the cells periodically and takes them out on the outside grounds and get fresh air. Talk on the phones to their familes and monitor and make sure they are actinf correctly there. He opens the doors as well to let people in and our at the jail. That's his job. But they are also considered cops.He can carry a gun if they need him to. He can carry pepper spray/ mace, a beanbag gun, a taser.l and more. But he usually doesn't carry anything. He likes to be hands on. Doesn't like to mace people or taze them unless he has to.
  
  But we have always carried. It is extremely dangerous out here. Too many murders out here. Everyday... So we carry for both our protection and others around us. I'm not letting nothung happen to anyone around me. It's sad that people can't act right now'a'days.

  Honestly I think the things that break up marriages is a lack of trust and communication between the two I don't think it's culture or tradition. But then again you could be correct because sometimes people have arranged marriages and parents are pressuring
  
  Sometimes there certain religions and rules in Families too
  
  I think honestly you just need to know for sure your decision before you get married and do what you want go with the flow don't have people pressure you in or out of a marriage

   Tell me about the most outstanding things about you ?
  ","
  Things that make me, me.
  
  I love to sing. That is probably one of my most favorite things to do. I love improving and making people smile when singing them. Giving them goosebumps & I love the applause that comes with it. I love to touch people's hearts with singing. I started singing around the age or 6 or 7. I have practiced throughtout my whole life tryna improve as best as I can. Get beeter and better, switch it up and try new things all the time. I have sang for many different events, for schools, my Paw paw's funeral. That was hard.. That day. I have auditioned for colleges. I have sang the national anthem for football games before. I was lead cantar for my Church for a few years & lead the Church for my school. I have sang karaoke for many different events. It runs in our blood. Many of my family members have bands & have been in bands. I love to sing. It is a love and passion for me... ?
  
  Determination.
  
  I have always had a HUGE level of determination in the things I've always wantes to succeed in life. I still WILL complete the dreams that I have set in my life or at least I will do my very best to!
  
  Art. Creativity. I have always found some sort of a peace with art. Photography, painting and wood burning. I enjoy doing all of the above. I love making people things! Makes me feel good! No cornyness intended.
  
  My curiosity.
  
  Adventuring.
  
  Exploring.
  
  I take a HUUUGE deal on the paranormal and with that comes with HUNDREDS of skeptics, questions and theories. I have been researching for over the past decade on this subject. I enjoy it very much and find the subject to be very unique and different. I find it very interesting. I love learning the history behind these places and what happened there and why? I almost feel like it is a type of level of respect for the one's who passed over in a way... It's hard to explain but is all just so interesting to me. I am very educated with it all and am very careful with how I go about things.
  
  Some things that make me, me.

  Thank you so much. Thanks for being respectful about it. There's a lot of people that aren't. And he has about 25 tattoos. He loves Nintendo games... me and him actually were in a long distance relationship for 4 and 1/2 years before we finally ended up together for good. That's when the distance ended was last year. I met him on Xbox 360 on Grand Theft Auto V back in 2014. I did not expect to meet him at all. I stumbled across him on a video game on accident and I am one hundred percent happy that I did. I have absolutely no regrets. We have two dogs together they are practically our children. We are in the process of trying to get a home. That is not easy... But we are trying.. I have a few tattoos myself.  I want to get more. Just like them. Haha. Idky?

   Is getting married young a good idea?
  ","
  Eh... Depends on ""how young"" ya talking... 16? Absolutely not. 18? Ehhh.. Depends on the relationship and the situations. Getting married at any age is a very important thing to make are you are ready for. You could be ready at 18? You could not? You could be ready at 50? You could not? It just depends on how ylur relationship is. Are you haloy with them? Do they take care of you? Do you trust them? Do they trust you? Is there constant communication? Is there chemistry? Is the situation/place your living with them safe? Are they good to you? Are you good to them? There is hundreds of questions! It is a HUGE commitment and you need to make sure that you are both ready for it!
  
  You should definitely wait until you're at least 18 to get married. But honestly a good age to get married is around 21, in my opinion. I got married this year. I am 23. I wanted to get married at 20. And that's okay. Cuz I was 100% for sure on my decision and so is he.

  I don't really understand your question but are you trying to ask me, are there ghosts in heaven? I mean I believe that your soul goes to heaven or hell when you die?
  
  Then there's the occasional skeptical stories on souls being trapped? Spirits? In my research over the years... though... people have the choice to believe it or not. Considering the theory could be wrong. The rest of this is a complicated subject. It would take me hours to explain it.

   Do you live alone? I'd like to know... how do you live when you're alone? I think It's a terrible thing to be lonesome .
  ","
  No I don't live alone. And it's okay to live alone. You don't have to have someone else in your life to make your life complete. Everybody's always stressing about that. Making big deals out of that. You can go your whole life without another person in your life. I think that's a big problem in our society today. Is people think there has to be another person there. You don't have to have someone to depend on. You could be one hundred percent happy and live alone. It is very possible.

   every day i go to work i need to wear something different
  ","
  I mean you don't always have to wear the same thing it just depends on what type of work you're doing. If you're doing messy work then you don't need to wear different things, just wear the same clothes because then you'd be ruining all of your clothes.
  
  If it's not a messy job then I can see the reason why you'd be wearing different clothes all the time. Iccould see the frustrations in that also. But honestly. I would just go to a store and just buy a bunch of different colored shirts with nothing on them amd just wear a different one everyday and get ya some blue jean shorts, jeans, and khakis. Just wear that all different days or something? I wouldn't care what others would think of me at work with what I'm waering. Your there to be safe, be respectful, and work. That's it.

   So you're into the paranormal you have a story you like to share
  ","
  I mean I've communicated with the Paranormal. I have went to places that were most definitely haunted. I have had things get picked up and put down. I've had doors open and close. I've heard people talking and other people have heard it as well. Knocks. Bangs. Squeaks. I have seen orbs before. Black figures.
  
  I have had people tell me tons of different situations that they have had. I know how to work a Ouija board though I promote...not to use them. 80% of all hauntings are caused by them & I dispromote them because most of the time people don't know how to properly use them & it's dangerous. The problem is you don't always know if you're talking positive entitys. You can get ahold of negative energies & demonic things. Negative energies & demons prey on the living, the weak, the scared, tend to follow them so that's why it's not good to indirectly speak to the afterlife. If do, you have to be very careful.
  
  Use every type of thing to prevent negative energys. You have to demand it away, praying it away, holy water, angels, burning sage, have things that are blessed, believing in God, a huge relationship with him is very important when working with this type if stuff.
  
  Now. If you can't get as  intense as poltergeist activity and things being thrown. Doors opening & slamming shut. Faucets turning off, on. Doors locking, unlocking. Cars turning on, off. Picture frames moving. Even the entity is able to write. Like draw. I know that sounds silly but it is very possible. Books flying(thrown). People getting attacked. People feeling that they're being choked & scratched & shoved. People being shoved or scratched. Rooms feeling extremely cold & then temperature changes in seconds. Animals reacting at things the house like they're seeing or hearing something. Sometimes people get randomly angry or sad. Sometimes the entities can affect people & manifest energy. Sometimes your cameras will go out & phones will die. It'll mess with your screen audio.
  
  Lol here's some stuff
  "

   Tell me about a time when u were most angry
  ","
  I mean this is not the most angry I have been but this was a time back in school when I saw some kid teasing and making fun of a kid that was special needed at PE for no absolute reason. It was a guy. I got straight up in his face and told him if he wouldn't leave him the f*** alone I'd beat his ass infront of everybody. My couch looked at me surprised because I looks dead-ass serious. He even told me to chill out because he thought I really was going to do it. I mean.. Didn't want to but like really?? The special needs guy wasn't even doing anything wrong to the dude. He just walked up to him and started taken the stuff that he was playing with away and teasing him. He was playing basketball and was having fun and the kid just walked up and started pissing him off and he didn't know any better, the special dude. Messed up... and me I was a good kid in school I never got cuz fights unless I had to. The seeing someone like that get made fun of. I just can't ignore it. It's not right. You leave people like that alone or you just being a friend, help them out. They're not like everybody else. They can't help that they were born that way.

  Do that maybe not exactly the words to the phrase but I feel like tolerance is a good word to use with that phrase.
  
  You can only take so much untiol you've had enough.
  
  It being the ability or willingness to tolerate whatever... in particular the existence of opinions or behavior that one does not necessarily agree with. The capacity to endure continued subjection to something, especially a drug, transplant, antigen, or environmental conditions, without adverse reaction. (Googled that part.)

Was it hard yes is it impossible no. Do I try to recommend that people not really because most people can't do it. It is very hard. But it can teach you a lot of good things about a relationship. Communication is important. Trust is important. Loyalty is important. The longest I was away from him was 13 and a half months. Granted, I wasn't 2000 miles away from him or anything but it was still a long distance. We couldn't always be together and we couldn't just get up and go next door we were hours away.

  But with long distance relationships you have to be very careful because not all of the friendships are fully trustful?
  
  There has to be constant communication and trust and loyalty and there has to be a lot of patience.
  
  You have to constantly be trying to spend time with them even if it's to call or video call. Again communication is most important.
  
  When spending time.. don't be controlling about the relationship and the times spent. You are far away from each other it's going to be hard. Do not let jealousy get in between the two of you. Let the other person know how much they mean to you constantly. You two need to be working hard to save money for situations.
  
  You need to build a friendship with that other person before you can have the relationship that is also very important for any relationship not just long-distance relationships.
  
  But that is what I think of long-distance relationships. They are very possible. They are not impossible. Are they easy, no. Can you get through them? Yes.
  
  I will have to say the younger that you are in a long-distance relationship the harder and the longer you may have to wait unless you have the support of your parents. If you want more advice. Keep asking questions.

   How judgemental of their appearance do you think you usually are when you first see someone? ??
  ","
  I usually don't try to judge anyone with appearance?
  
  But I don't really just talk to anyone? With the old saying, ""Don't talk to strangers,"" because considering how bad and crazy this world is now.. It's dangerous and offensive to sometimes even acknowledge someone. People get pissed now a day. Back in the day. You were to talk and acknowledged everyone and tell them, ""hello,"" and, ""good morning,"" and it was rude if not? If you walk into a building. You are to be kind and open. Positive. Today's society, you have to be careful who you speak to.
  
  But who do I choose to not speak to maybe based off of looks? Well see.. That's the thing. We don't know. I don't? I used to have a really punk type style and people used to be scared of me and they would usually avoid me, but i was mean or scary. I am, or at least I could say am not that. I try to be as fair and open as I can. Positive and full of energy but at the same time chill and collected.
  
  Just depends.

  This was my first one. It is a compass in the shape of a dreamcatcher. It is God's way of showing me paths in life. Then I love geography. The feather is a Indian feather. I love paint so there's a paint splatter on it. Abstract.
  
  Its quite long and wide and very colorful.
  
  My second tattoo is of a diamond with again a abstract watercolor splatter on it. It is very special. It is a matching tattoo with someone else and has a ton of meaning behind it.  It has an entire story of a long distance relationship that turned into a success. Him being the blue and me being the red and us coming together finally after four and a half years of long-distance being purple, together at last. The tattoo blends these colors together. We also met in April and the stone for April is a diamond. Also a diamond is impossible to break and it's symbolizing us impossible to break. We're together happy & married. Meaning so much with such a small tattoo. Yes ❤??

   Why spring turns to summer and then autumn?
  ","
  Only a few parts of the world experience four seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter. Many parts of the world get only two or even one. Every day, the Earth spins once on its axis. But the planet isn't perfectly upright when it spins. Collisions during its formation, the Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees.
  
  The Earth takes it annual trip around the Sun, different areas of the planet face the Sun more directly during their daylight hours at different times of the year.
  
  The tilt also affects the daily amount of light, without it the whole planet would have 12-hour days and nights every day of the year.
  
  This is some information.

   How do you know if a guy is the one ? I mean I Always every guy is the one every time I’m with someone but it never turns out to be so how do you know ? Girls only
  ","
  Honestly you shouldn't be feeling like every single one is ""the one."" You maybe in the rows of a bad habit.. It can happen to some of us.
  
  And saying habit.. what i am explain.. You maybe trying too hard to settle.. Too quickly... Slow down. Wait. Patience. When the time comes, it will be the right one. Then it's up to the two of you to make the communication work. Work together. Trust one another. Build both a friendship and a relationship together. You've got to be able to tell them absolutely everything and the same back with them. Be comfortable with eachother and most importantly. Go slow with starting a new relationship. Do things unexpectedly. Be spontaneous. Be different. Be caring and sweet. Try to understand eachother. Dont judge them. (But still be careful with who you are with)
  
  The one you are with now. If this one doesn't work out, wait for some time and find yourself and figure yourself out. You don't want to get any habits of trying to constantly find someone to settle down with. That is not good for you. It can lead to you being confused like you kind of are right now. I am speaking from experience. I went from one guy to another once trying to figure out who I could settle down with. It hurts some of there feelings and yours also... And that's not right.. I waited and waited and had patience and then I ended up finding the person that I really wanted and needed to be with and I knew right away that that was the one. You've got to know yourself before you can know another and then, take care of that other.
  
  Five years later down the line.. I am married and I have two dogs and we are getting a house next year.
  
  Life will steer you in the right directions. But if you force flow to work, sadly in the end.. You may find out the hard way. You can't plan your whole life minute by minute. Things happen and happen for a reason. Let flow happen.
  
  Idk who you are but I spoke this as trueful as I could. Hope that this helps! Good luck!

   Does anyone know any tips to lose weight quickly?
  ","
  Less big meals.
  
  Try lots of healthy snacks throughtout the week.
  
  Fun exercise
  
  Don't over do it.
  
  Work on 2 thing everyday
  
  One day arms.
  
  Next day legs... And so forth. Make a schedule to work out. You don't have to spend the whole day at the gym. Go for 2 hours? After get a light salad. Try fish. Cut out bread almost 100%. Try new thing. Eat veggies both cooked and raw. Such as carrots and broccoli. When eating salad. Don't drench it with dressings and cheese. Less add. Less red meats.
  
  More food baked then fired and bbc.
  
  Try to cut out steak.
  
  Work on keeping your metabolism moving. Don't eat just straight high in fiber foods, all the time, 247. No.. Some, yes. Mornung time is a good time. Wake up at least an hour before doing anything. Like gling to work or going out. You need to try and eat breakfast the 1st 10 minutes your up so you can get your memetabolism moving. Then get ready for your day. Keep up with your hygiene. That also can play a role in loosing weight.
  
  This is some tips. If ya ever want more. Ask away. These are thing I do and have researched on loosing weight. This is also good for toning.

It's interesting it's kind of like thrift shopping. Always new adventures when doing that. Sometimes we like to go down to the beach it's not far from our house it's about an hour and a half to two hours away. Go bowling or ice skating. Going to see a matinee. Go and watch a play. Go to the museums. Go to the library. Go to the strip mall but that's kind of far away from where I live at. Sometimes I go outside and do some yard work. I actually enjoy going outside and working. Work on the truck. Cook. Watch a good movie and eat popcorn. (At home) go to the park. Go for a walk. Go and visit friends or family. Lots of different things.

  Like 2 or nore years a week or so and then more than that then like a few weeks. And you have to take a week off at a time and then of course have your free sick days with excuses.

   How should I make it less awkward between my crush and I after he rejected me? Cause I still want to remain friends.
  ","
  It is really hard to come back after asking or telling your crush that you like or love them but you can definitely make a comeback you just need to act cool and act like what you did before. There's nothing wrong with caring for the other person. Just don't make it obvious anymore those feelings and don't make them feel uncomfortable. If they get angry at you then this friend does not deserve to be in your life. It's okay to have feelings for somebody. It's also okay to let it be known, but if they reject you apologize in a way... tell them this is how I feel but if you are not feeling the same way that's okay we can go back to just being what we were before and just let them know that you do have feelings for them but you will remain to not make them feel uncomfortable, let them know that you are not going to have any intentions on continuing your feelings for them in that way. And you should be good.

   How to lose weight?
  ","
  Workout, eat healthy, wake up early, go to sleep on time, make sure you sleep at least six hours make sure you do not sleep over 10 hours, don't eat right before you go to sleep, no late-night snacking, drink more apple juice and orange juice(not a ton) and eat more foods high in fiber not too many, make sure you eat anywhere from two to four meals a day not huge meals, try to cut out as many carbs as you can, exercise, drink only water usually, lemonades okay, you can still drink soda but very very rare not good for you.
  
  Learn to make better food choices and eat less grease and buttery foods
  
  Cut fast food out of your diet almost 100%
  
  Try to avoid to eat things that are high in sodium and fat it's okay to eat things that have sodium in fat just things that have less
  
  Get on a bathroom schedule make sure that you keep your hygiene up and take showers everyday change your clothes regularly throughout the day this also affects weight loss
  
  Be positive and happy
  
  Surprisingly this also effects weight loss
  
  Maybe invest in a gym membership and try to go to the gym 3-5 times out the week
  
  Just watch what you eat for long liitle bit
  
  When you do eat do not eat large quantities of food at once and remember to always eat slow and take your time and chew your food this also affects weight loss
  
  Lastly weigh yourself this week and do not why yourself until the end of that month then do your totals. watching your weight will cause you to mentally mess up... you're putting too much thought into it... don't keep track of your way day by day do it neither week by week or month by month. Maybe even by every 60 days.
  
  Finally believe in yourself that you can do this have confidence in yourself and feel good about yourself
  
  You can also look up on YouTube different types of exercises that you can do and every morning that you wake up maybe go out for a jog
  
  Give yourself types of food to eat and stick with different types of routines throughout the weeks
  
  GOOD LUCK!

  A slut to me.
  
  Is not a girl that just and only sleeps around. To me a slut is a person that is like bratty and flirts with everyone and geta with everyone. Lier. Hides the relationships. A person that infatuates over people. Isnt serious with a relationship. Just a person that is indecisive in what relationship tjey want, so they settle for more than one. Can be a person that sleeps with nore than one person.
