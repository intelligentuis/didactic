that shit from my life pretty successfully","95713":"that was a big part of it but i ve learned to let go of a lot of that through therapy . now if i note someone s actions and worry about them , my reaction is to promote peacefulness within myself rather than worry about how i can change things for the other person","95714":"sure . i m hypersensitive to other people s actions because of hyper vigilance from cptsd","95715":"no nor have i read it though i feel like the book was on a list of books i intended to read at one time","95716":"yes sometimes we re married , sometimes he s just

for instance , but now is a super complex with several condominium towers , schools , and a large field where festivals and fairs and markets happen . the neighboring area has built up to become a booming seaside town . i m now loving out in the country a little bit but i can still walk to the mall where i work and go to school . the mall is as busy and important to this town as malls were in the s in middle america . there is a food court with neo lights and standard department and boutique stores , also some medical offices on the edges and a mall clinic . i have spent a lot of time in the back parts of the mall , the storage facilities and the hallways and the long empty corridors past the backdoors of the shops","95721":"always . my art was being shown at the mall gallery in part

third character that s a woman that is not a love interest and idris fucking elba as the bad guy who is badass as hell and part robot","95771":"i hate kids movies lol . i never want to be one of those adults at disneyworld . i hated the first couple of fast and furious but the thing is they re so inclusive and every single one passes the bechdel test and they have gay main characters and woman main characters and several races so i love all of that but then also irl the rock and vin diesel both have clauses in their work riders that they can t lose a fight so you have these two dudes that can t lose fighting against each other and against others and the fights become so redunkulous like they re basically superheroes by the fifth movie","95772":"star wars , mad max , and fast and furious the new hobbs and shaw was so good i don t really care about anything else like tom cruise can suck it","95773":"that s my favorite recent non action film . i have a thing for action franchises too

rape","95788":"he s not good at anything else . well actually i did like drag me to hell but not the same way he s only good at that one take of evil dead . not his first try , mind you , but the second try when he took himself slightly less seriously and slightly more artistically","95789":"i ve seen ole brucie at a few comic cons and he s a fun , bright guy . but it s not him i care about it s raimi s filmmaking","95790":"so moving","95791":"i saw most of the first season i think ? i dunno . bruce is so goofy . i mean he s great but like i loved the art of evil dead . the way the blood hit the lightbulb . the way the madness scene was filmed with all of the taxidermy . the pure ridiculousness of the sincerity the lines are said with .","95792":"it was alright . i class it with army of darkness and the first one . . . . not as good as evil dead","95793":"well normally i say sat wars or mad max or fast n furious like any of em except for the middle star wars three , but honestly my all time favorite movies that i never give enough love are harold and maude and evil dead","95794":"lator gator","95795":"it s privilege but i ve got it in a lot of ways so it s hard for me to

of smashing pumpkins lol omg i m so old","95798":"i don t really relate . i have a good life that i m doing better at living every day","95799":"i don t feel like i struggle with my burdens that much

so much . i just prefer birds irl .","95809":"without meaning to , yes . my aura seems to be a major factor . some want to read my hand . one time i was at my apartment minding my own biz and i broke my toe and my friend came rushing in because a fortune teller stopped her in salem and told her to come help me with my broken foot","95810":"because every single being is different","95811":"nah . psychics love flagging me down in public to exclaim things about me though . it s been a lifelong thing . i actively avoid parts of some cities where the fortune tellers hang out","95812":"every single love is different so yes but it still wouldn t be the same","95813":"it s latin for owl","95814":"yes ! and sometimes . . . . . she s a different animal . she s been a hamster and a larger parrot and a cat and a duck and a snake and a bumblebee","95815":"deeply caring about the well being of another being","95816":"i have lots of love but what i honestly do need more of is just
