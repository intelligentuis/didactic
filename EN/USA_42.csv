  I wanna say I mentioned this in a reply the other day but I can’t remember who I was talking to lol and I can’t find the post.
  
  The grey in my profile pics I’m riding is probs only worth like $1,000-$1,200 bc he’s so old and kinda out of shape still. That’s about average price for a horse that will let you touch it and sit on it but it only has basic/limited training for riding.
  
  For example, the one in my profile pic doesn’t know how to jump, how to take the correct canter leads, about self carriage, or anything about any sort of competition level stuff. He just knows walk, stop, and run all crooked and wonky like a crazy weirdo 😂 He’s not very good at going in a straight line or listening to the rider but he’s nice and he’ll let you sit on his back and walk around

  Thanks ☺️ Here’s a pic of the ugliest horse I’ve ever loved for ya 😂 His name was Roscoe and he was my first ever lease horse. They rescued him from the racetrack and I really took to him like, immediately. His owners sold him after I trained him for a while when I was in my early teens. Wish I could’ve bought him but it wasn’t in the cards for me unfortunately

  ","
  They’re v cute babies :) I appreciate them a lot and they’re good companions lol. My first word was actually “dog” and I’ve always had a love for them but my fave animal has to be a horse lol. Not sure if I prefer one over the other as far as company or friendship but dogs sure are more convenient and easy to care for haha
  "
225524,"
   ok how much does one of those horses cost
  ","
  The bay pony named Max (the dark brown one with the dark brown mane and tail that I sometimes post about) is probably worthless. Maybe a few hundred dollars at best. He’s elderly with a few health problems and doesn’t know much as far as actual training is concerned. He came from a bad abuse situation so he’s mistrustful and takes an experienced person to handle him sometimes.
  
  The grey horse in my profile pic, that’s Chance, is probably worth like 1-2000 dollars in his current condition and at his current age. He’s also considered an elderly horse now since he’s 21. Horses usually live to be about 30 years old.
  
  A nice horse that’s in good health, not super old, and has solid training for riding can cost anywhere from around $1,200 to literal hundreds of thousands of dollars. It all depends on how much they know/their training, their overall physical health, their bloodlines, and their conformation (their body build).

   Why are horse girls always crazy?
  ","
  No more crazy than gamers, otakus, or “eccentric” artists. Maybe people think equestrians are crazy because any time women in general get excited or passionate about something, people are quick to stigmatize it and point out that it’s “crazy” or “dumb”.
  
  Nobody says that gamers are “crazy” for obsessing over COD or Halo games. Nobody labels people who collect merchandise from their favorite anime show as “crazy”.
  
  Nobody really stigmatizes any of that as “crazy” particularly because on the whole it’s men who tend to enjoy those activities and they have historically been much more of a male centric market. Any time a female-dominated activity, sport, or pastime, has become popular, people label people who like it as “crazy”.
  
  There ARE some individuals in every fandom, activity, or sport that make a bad name for the rest of everyone else, but tbh it’s silly to blanket statement anything and say people who do ____ or are ____  or people who like ____ are crazy.
  "

   That’s not how I live my life, but you have to prove to me that you’re worthy of me being nice. Otherwise I will treat you with hesitance, as everyone should be when you meet him.

  ","
  My bf once told me that he genuinely thinks a good, kind, woman has the power to help make any man nicer and better. Love is powerful but the man himself also has to want to be better, more trusting, and nicer for himself, otherwise he’ll stay calloused and bitter his whole life and never know the freedom of true happiness, love, and trust.

  ","
  Sounds the same as my bf. He’s also a baby-faced, blue eyed, white dude who grew up in the hood. From what he’s told me, instead of mean-mugging and trying to establish dominance over people,  he just befriended everyone and was cool with people and made them laugh so nobody robbed him or fucked with him cause they were all cool. He essentially chose happiness and developing social skills over cynicism and misery. Doesn’t seem impossible

  There’s a difference between being nice to people and not knowing how to say no/stand up for yourself and let people walk all over you. It’s difficult and some people never really get the hang of it but it’s an essential life skill to have if someone is going to be happy and mentally healthy

   When did I ever imply it was rape?
  ","
  Beastiality is so disgusting for so so many more reasons,  but specific to my point about it being rape is that animals cannot consent or dissent to sexual relations including fellatio. I cannot believe I have to explain that forcing yourself on anyone, including an animal, without verbal consent is rape.
  
  Since animals are incapable of ever providing verbal consent to any kind of sexual act, your ask implying that I “suck a horse’s dick”  is therefore also considered an act of rape. Im not into beastiality, not into rape, and not into this conversation.
  
  So tired of people thinking it’s somehow hilarious to ask or imply that there’s anything sexual about equestrian sports. So exhausting to listen to
  "
225929,"
   I meant it metaphorically.
  ","
  I don’t think you did my dude. There was nothing that suggested any sort of metaphor. In case you were confused, a metaphor is a figure of speech where a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable.
  
  Harassing me out of the blue by implying that I rape animals is not metaphorical nor is it funny. It’s just annoying and rude.

   What is your advice on dealing with a heartbreak?
  ","
  Support from friends and family is important! Start doing things for YOU again and invest your time in activities that make you happy. It’s gonna suck for real and it’s okay to feel upset. Being sad is part of the healing process and bottling it up acting like it doesn’t bother you is unhealthy and won’t help. Get outside and get some sunshine, do physical activities, push yourself to get out there and try new things. Don’t look for another partner, just live your life and learn to love yourself and make your own self happy again without relying on anyone else 🌞 💕

   I think that I suffer from moderate depression, but why do I feel like I am not as depressed as usual when I'm busy? Sometimes I feel stupid and ask myself "" Am I suffering from depression or am I just faking it?
  ","
  Keeping busy helps you not be depressed because it’s a distraction. If you’re feeling uncontrollably low and unhappy with yourself, uninterested in activities and people that used to make you happy, you find yourself not wanting to do basic self care like shower or eat, you’d rather lay or sit down a lot and do nothing, you find yourself spacing out and having a hard time paying attention, ou often forget things when that never used to be a problem for you, and you feed sad and want to cry a lot but can’t put your finger on the reason why, you may be depressed.
  
  If you have a few or more of these symptoms that’s depression and you need to find the root cause and eliminate it. Dig deep and do some self reflecting. If you’re just sad sometimes as a result of negative stigma in your life that’s normal and isn’t depression.

  ","
  Support from your friends and fam. Just leave. Pack your shit and leave. You don’t owe your abuser anything and it’s not open for discussion with them bc they’re going to try to make you feel crazy for leaving or that you need them somehow. You don’t. THEY need you to push around. You don’t deserve that. No one does. Just get out and cut ties with them. Take your kids, dogs, belongings, whatever, and GET OUT.

  I started out riding English and doing dressage, then hunters, then eventing, then hunters again, and now I’ve just been riding trail for a long time but I really wanna get back  into the swing of hunter/jumper.
  
  Don’t think Chance will ever be any sort of high jumping guy tbh. He’s 21 now and he’s p much only ever done trail I’m told- but I think it’d be super fun to take him over some ground poles and tech him the basics so we could see what sort of tiny obstacles we could go over out on trail rides instead of walking around them :) he’s so brave so I know he’d be an honest little jumper. He loves water and doesn’t care one bit about most scary objects or loud strange sounds. Such a good old guy 🥰

  Club soda! Let it soak in club soda for a while and blot it with a towel. DONT RUB THE STAIN! You’ll rub it into the fabric. You can also use oxiclean stain remover from the store after washing as much as you can out with cold running water. Again, don’t rub the stain until you’re scrubbing it with oxiclean. Then after either of the club soda or oxiclean treatments out it in your normal washing machine cycle. If the stain hasn’t come out by then DO NOT put it in the dryer. Try stain treatment again and wash it again. If the stain has been in your clothes for a long time or if you rubbed it in a lot sometimes it gets really set in there and will never come out :/ good luck!

   why are men afraid of not looking manly enough in front of females?
  ","
  Just like women are told all their life to be thin, be modest, to compare themselves to models, to close their legs, to sit up, to watch their tempers, to be obedient, etc, lots of men are told to “man up” and shut up and tough it out, to not be girly, to not wear certain colors or like certain things bc it’s “gay” etc. Its all just toxic bs that society crams down people’s throats in an effort to adhere to some imaginary social “norm”. It’s fear of being ostracized for not being good enough. To me for both genders it’s almost like they’re wearing a mask, a layer of fakeness that they feel like they have to put on to fit in. It’s like they’re afraid to be themselves sometimes. It’s all rooted in pressure from people around them to be a certain way or else people “won’t like them”. It’s toxic and it’s so dumb. For both men and women it’s all so trivial

  ","
  Haha I mean I guess maybe for some people but not for mine. I swore off prescription drugs a long while ago (except like Advil and stuff). It just wasn’t working for me. Wasnt my thing. Now I manage my mental health by talking it through, keeping healthy habits, going outside, staying active, and surrounding myself with positive and supportive people :) Big pharma in the US doesn’t care about helping people or curing diseases or getting people healthy enough to stop needing to take pills.

   Why don't you tie yourself to the saddle like they do with little children?
  ","
  Lol sorry for the long answer but that’s actually VERY dangerous and should NOT be done for riding.
  
  In the event of an emergency the rider wouldn’t be able to bail. For example if the horse were to somehow trip and fall down you’d be crushed to death under their weight with no escape cause you couldn’t get off. If they bolted off and started bucking like a bronco the rider wouldn’t be able to sit up and prevent them from doing that by using their body as a counter balance. If one of the ties holding you to the saddle broke off and you partially fell down while the horse was in motion, you’d be halfway tied to the saddle and dragged by the leg connected to the saddle with your body on the ground next to the horse’s feet risking being trampled, kicked, knocked on the head, breaking your leg, ankle, etc by having it twisted while stuck to the saddle.
  
  I’ve actually seen this happen to someone before and they had multiple injuries from it. Broken ankle, torn knee tendon, broken ribs, concussion, and a whole bunch of cuts and bruising everywhere. Overall it’s just a super horrible idea. PLUS a lot of riding involves a form of basically standing up in the stirrups to properly balance and move with the horse. If you were tied to the saddle it would be super hard to do that and you’d be flopping around really uncomfortably.
  
  I’ve seen people with disabilities be strapped in the the saddle for hippotherapy sessions with people walking with the horse on both sides of them and with a person leading the horse with a rope in front because the rider is incapable of sitting up on their own, but never really seen someone strap a young child into a saddle actually. It’s important for a beginner level person just learning to ride to hold their own selves up so they can be able to build up their muscles and be better balanced later in their riding journey

  You just have to listen to them. You have to pay attention to their breathing, their pace, how sweaty they are, how hot their skin is feeling to the touch, just like, their overall look and feel. It’s not hard to tell when a horse is feeling tired and needs a break or when they need to be done for the day. They tell you in their own silent way through their body language.
  
  I think the longest I’ve ever rode was like a 3 or 4 hour trail ride or so but we were walking the whole time which made it pretty easy on the horse and it didn’t make him very tired. We also took several breaks where I got off and his back got to rest and he got to chill and eat grass

  After being around horses for more than like, a day, you just get used to it. They’re animals so they don’t really know what constitutes a bad time haha.

  "
226493,"
   does your butt/other bits hurt while rideing?
  ","
  Not if you’re sitting correctly. It’s only after a few hours of riding that you’ll feel sore but I think that’s mostly just being stiff from sitting in the same position for so long. Like how you’re a bit sore after a long car trip, ya know?
  "
226494,"
   and how?
  ","
  Unlike dogs who are mostly concerned about pleasing their owner in order to receive food and love (and therefore a place in the pack), horses are only concerned with feeling like you can provide safety from predators and that you’ll protect them as a good friend. Food is pretty much everywhere for them, so your relationship has to be based more on trust and friendship rather than being “the food and pets person”.
  
  It’s that fact that gives people the opportunity to learn about themselves in ways that lots of other animals can’t help you with. In order to work with horses effectively, get them to do what you want, and be a good horseman, you need to be able to center yourself and control your emotions. Horses can only react to stimulus that we give them. They don’t understand anything else other than what we show them through our subtle body language and tone of voice. They’re really really good at picking up the vibe somebody gives off and picking up on their mood. Horses can help us realize what sort of vibes were putting out and how our actions, thoughts, and words affect others around us. They can help us learn to be more calm, confident, compassionate, and centered.

  ","
  Usually they just do it haha. They don’t even need to stop moving to poo. They can literally gallop and poo at the same time, no problem 😂
  
  Going pee is different though. They have to stand still to do that.
  
  The way you tell if they need to go pee is male horses will take a wide stance with all 4 legs and “drop” (if you know what I mean) before they go. Female horses will lift their tail to the side and take a slightly wider stance with only their back legs before they go

  He’s pretty mindful of them and tends to keep his distance from them. I assume he’s been kicked or accidentally stepped on before bc he won’t get too close. Sandy’s family dog Nugget loves to try to get the horses to play though. He’ll bark at them and run around and jump up on his two back feet and try to paw them. It’s super cute but we always have to tell him to cut it out cause we don’t want the horses to get annoyed an kick his face in haha that would be an expensive vet bill

  Yeah, long story short he belonged to some crackheads who never fed him and kept him tied up on a short rope out front of their trailer in a junkyard and he kept escaping so animal control got called on them and the very last time he escaped their house to run around on the streets in the middle of winter and eat roadkill I decided it was too cruel to keep giving him back to those people who abused him so I just took him home and he became my dog. There’s a bit more to the story but that’s the basic premise. Those people were pretty messed up

  Walked out into the pasture the other day to fetch the boys for a nice trail ride and found Max chilling in one of the horse’s favorite spots, under the bushes/in the brush next to the fence. I walked up to him front on, petted his face, clipped on his lead rope and started to walk away thinking he’d follow like usual but he didn’t. I tried tempting him with treats, baby talk, and giving the rope a few good wiggles and nudges hoping he’d get the idea and follow but he didn’t. I was kinda confused cause he loves treats and is usually very cooperative and likes being petted and brushed and fussed over.
  
  I walked back over to him, this time to his side checking to see if he didn’t want to come with me yet because he was busy using the bathroom...but then I saw this! He had gotten his whole leg stuck in the brush somehow! This has literally never happened before I was so puzzled on how the heck he managed to do this! This pic was taken while I was waiting with him when Sandy went to get the yard clippers to cut him free. He was perfectly unharmed and totally relaxed the whole time, just a bit stuck, poor old man! We went for a nice walk after this :)

   I looked up the largest polar bears & it said 11.1 inch tall and 2,209 lbs. then I looked up largest liger (10.8 inches, 2,200 lbs) which means they are almost the exact same size. In India, Tigers hunt bears as PREY. So I feel like a liger will me more use to handling a polar bear than Vice versa.
  ","
  If we’re talking about animals that fall on the extreme end of the normal curve then, maybe they’d be evenly matched. My previous assessment was based on average sized animals though, not abnormally large ones. Also, as far as your claim about tigers preying on bears on the Indian subcontinent, yea that is true but those bears they’re killing are Sloth Bears, not anything near the size or strength of a polar bear. Sloth bears are 6 feet shorter and 1,500 lbs lighter than a polar bear. Like maybe they’d see the bear and know it was a bear but I don’t think it would be anything like they were used to so going into a fight as a tiger expecting the bear to react like a sloth bear would might be the tiger’s downfall. I’m still thinking east Tko for the world’s largest and strongest bear species

  If you don’t ever expose yourself to common knowledge or take any interest in learning new information the. of course you won’t know about it. I suggest you take your doctor’s opinion and advice into consideration but also do your own research and see what thousands of other doctors have to say. Deny science if you want, that’s your own personal choice, but at the end of the day, the only way we can get over this pandemic quickly is by working together and continuing to do what we know works: wear masks in public.

This isn’t said in a rude way, what I mean is people who get shit for “being basic” aren’t getting dunked on for liking mainstream things, they’re getting made fun of for being fake, trying too hard, being catty, and not being true to themselves. Just be you, do you, do what you want. Everyone is their own brand of weird and that’s good!

  So you could say “because I’m so tall and strong like Superman and I’m only 21. I’m going to be in the NFL”.
  
  Like not even trying to be a rude ass person but I’ve already called you out about it cause it was getting a bit much and you got defensive. Js

  Not being so caught up in looking hard, or acting cool, or being “manly”, that you can just be yourself around her and have fun being goofy and trying new things and go on adventures. Not being embarrassed to show your love to her no matter what!
  
  Just chilling with my man and seeing him act the same way toward me around his friends as he does when we’re alone is comforting and makes me happy knowing he values me and is proud of me enough to show me off to his friends and wants to include me in all aspects of his life.

   Do you think we’re designed for monogamy? (Why or why not?) ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
  ","
  Most apes aren’t monogamous, however I think humans probably were built for monogamy because of the presence of jealousy. The biological purpose of jealousy is to retain access to a valuable mate and prevent others from “taking” them. Since human babies also require so much parental care and effort unlike a lot of other animals who can stand up and start running just hours after birth, I think monogamous relationships also became the norm to help in childcare. It would make sense that both parents stayed together and helped since it gives the offspring a better chance of survival.

   Out of the negative emotions of GREED, ANGER, JEALOUSY and HATE, which one would you say AFFECTS you the most?
  ","
  I haven’t felt jealous or hateful in years. They’re emotions I’ve learned to let go when they arise and it’s taken a lot of self-work to get there. I can’t say I’m all that greedy either...I honestly like living a modest life even though I know it would be way more comfortable if I were richer, more aggressive, or played unfairly to get an advantage and whatnot. Also it’s extremely difficult to make me angry. Anger is another emotion that I rarely feel bc I was very angry/confused as a kid and I know I don’t ever want to feel that again so I check myself when I’m feeling annoyed. Annoyed is the negative emotion I feel the most and I guess that’s like the mildest form of anger possible sooo anger I guess?

  Horses have a much better sense of smell than we humans but they aren't as good at scent recognition as a dog is. While they ARE able to identify predators, their people, and other horses by their smell, they can’t sniff things out or track things like dogs

You ask a lot of other great questions and you’re a nice person who’s entertaining to talk to, so I hope you take a step back and take this with a grain of salt:
  
  But a good quantity of your questions seem kinda like humble brags if I’m being honest like always asking me how much I think you can lift, or how tall you are, telling me how you’re so good at football all the time, repeatedly bringing up how your ex gf is a model, always saying how you’ll be a millionaire, and asking me how handsome I think you are and then you get flustered and defensive when I say i don’t care about that stuff. Just not sure why you’re asking/telling me stuff like that.
  
  I know you think I’m pretty and stuff like you’ve said before, and that’s flattering, but trying to puff your chest and discretely “show off” doesn’t and won’t ever make me want to flirt with you.  I feel I don’t need to be sorry about that fact. And maybe that’s not what you’re trying to do, but from my end that’s how it seems.
  
  This isn’t an attack on you, it’s just an explanation of my own feelings. If you can’t handle the reality of that then oh well 🤷🏽‍♀️ if you wanna be salty at me then do it 🤷🏽‍♀️ I literally do not care lol

  One time some dumbass took too much acid in the 7th grade school library and started throwing books at people and tried to get on the roof and Juno off to fly away. He was yelling “fuck the police” as they carried him away from the school strapped to a stretcher to get him to cooperate. Turns out the acid he took was a placebo, just a piece of white paper someone sold him out of spite cause he was a narc. He acted a fool and thought he was tripping when he was completely sober.

   Do you think remote learning is an okay replacement to in person school for small children/elementary aged children?
  ","
  For little kids it’s really difficult to keep them engaged when you’re not right there with them. It’s better than nothing at all, but it’s not ideal. My sister is an elementary school teacher who had to switch over to virtual learning with her little ones and it’s been a nightmare for the class. All the kids end up not paying attention and yelling over eachother and getting distracted. Lots of the kids spend most of the class jamming things in their mouths and up their noses and it’s kinda dangerous because the teacher (my sis) can’t actually help them if they choke or get something stuck even though she’s technically the person in charge of them

   If a pitch black horse had offspring with an albino horse. How would the offspring look?
  ","
  To answer that I’ll have to start off by explaining what causes an animal to be either albino or pure black. What makes an animal albino is a recessive and somewhat rare gene called the “amelanistic“ gene. Aka  the gene that causes a lack of melanin (the thing that pigments your skin and hair). You see, albino animals aren’t white, they have no pigment, no color at all, and it shows up as white. What makes an animal pure black is also a recessive and somewhat rare gene called the “melanistic” gene, a gene that causes an animal to have really ramped up melanin production resulting in black hair and skin.
  
  There really isn’t one answer to this question, but the most likely result would probably be a “normal” looking offspring that was neither melanistic nor albino. The most common colors that horses are born with are chestnut and bay. My bet is that the resulting offspring would be some shade of brown like chestnut or bay since those are the most dominant genes.

  Wishing ill on someone else is bad karma, a waste of time and energy, and sets your mindset up for failure.

   Are there Albino horses 🐎?
  ","
  Yeah totally. Albino horses coat color is legit just called “white” and it’s pretty rare. You can tell a white horse from a gray horse by the color of their skin under their firm. White horses are born white and stay white throughout their entire lives and have pink skin everywhere on their body, unlike gray horses who are typically born a darker coat color and gray out as they age. Gray horses also have gray skin instead of pink. Pictured in the left is a white horse and on the right is a grey for reference

  ","
  The big Percheron looking horse? I think I saw a news article on that. Such a shame that his people treated him/her so poorly. It’s outrageous to force animals to work so hard they nearly die! Just despicable and cruel.
  
  People like that who are only interested in using animals to make money should never have animals to start with. I hope that horse’s owners are barred from ever owning another animal again and that the horse goes to a loving and caring home where it’ll be treated with the respect it deserves
  "
227443,"
   And riding a Donkey is okay?🤔
  ","
  Every animal has a limit to the amount of weight they can safely carry, including donkeys. As long as your animal is healthy, it can carry you if your body weight + the weight of the riding equipment falls under that specific carrying capacity. Assuming it’s a healthy and well-cared-for animal, its carrying capacity depends on how much the animal weighs and how much you and the equipment combined weigh.
  
  Typically, equines are safely capable of carrying 20% of their healthy body weight. An average donkey weighs about 1000 pounds, so they can safely carry a load of up to 200 pounds.

  "
227445,"
   Can you ride a dwarf horse?
  ","
  No. Dwarf breeds like the Falabella and Shetland aren’t meant for riding and to force them to carry a fully grown person would be cruel. Small/dwarf breeds were created as companion animals or, in the Shetland Pony’s case, to pull mining carts in small tunnels.
  
  That being said, small breeds like the Shetland Pony are suitable mounts for children because kids are small and light. Lots of people introduce their very little kids to horseback riding using a Shetland pony or other small breed like a miniature horse or welsh pony

  ","

  "
227447,"
   i suppose you cannot ride a foal, maybe wait till they're a bit older maybe like 3 or 4 years?
  ","
  Right, you can’t ride a foal because they’re too small and their bones aren’t fully fused yet. It’s best to just handle a foal and get it used to daily care activities like walking on a lead rope, brushing, and blanketing.
  
  Horse’s vertebrae aren’t fused enough to safely carry the weight of a rider until they’re 3 or 4. Doing so before that time could permanently injure your horse and nobody wants that!
  "
227448,"
   what's the first body language you look for in a horse? like to know if it's calm or bothered
  ","
  First I look for a relaxed body position, relaxed facial expression, and relaxed or forward ear position. All that indicates a calm horse. Resting their weight off of one leg, falling asleep, and showing calm interest in others are also signs that they’re happy and just chilling.
  
  If a horse is bothered/frightened/upset they look tense. They hold their head up high, have tight muscles and look kinda stiff, show the whites of their eyes, have tightly closed lips, and tip their ears back. Not like flattened ears, that’s a sign of anger, but just facing backwards. They also tend to blow and snort and won’t keep still if they’re frightened or upset.

   Horses are dangerous... my cousin got kicked by one an it broke his freaking jaw like oh my
  ","
  I hope your cousin is okay! That’s really really unfortunate. Horses are animals and can act unpredictably just like any other animal. However, the likelihood of injury increases when horses are handled by inexperienced people. Sometimes accidents happen tho, even to professionals.
  
  I hope your cousin isn’t afraid to be around horses after that! Animals never act with malicious intent, they only react to stimulus presented to them. I hope they know that that horse didn’t kick them bc it hated them or something! It was probably just nervous about something humans don’t usually think about :(

   Okay another question about horses an I'm not aksing cuz you already know this but I'm genuine curious why do horses bob/nod their head??
  ","
  When they bob/nod their heads repetitively when standing around the stable or in the field, it’s typically indicative of some sort of boredom or stress response. Sometimes it’s based on an old bad habit they just never broke. Same goes with similar repetitive behaviors like biting the fence or stall door (cribbing), swinging their neck/ head back and forth (weaving), pawing/stomping with no bugs present, obsessively flapping their lips, or sucking their tongues.
  
  If they constantly bob their head  only when a rider is on their back then it could be a sign of discomfort or pain caused by bad health, poorly fitting tack, a harsh-handed rider, or being ridden by someone who is too heavy for them to comfortably carry.

   why do horses neigh?
  ","
  Not sure if your question was specifically “why do they make the neigh sound or why would they neigh at certain times” so I’ll answer both.
  
  The shape of their vocal chords and the way they’re situated in the larynx just happens to make the neighing sound which is why they sound that way. They usually neigh when they’re excited, when they’re calling out to other horses, or as a response to being frightened. The same reasons a dog might bark or a cow might moo

Usually the lions just give up after a while. They’re not built to run as long or as fast as prey animals like horses or zebras or wildebeests. Lion hunts typically only have about a 30% success rate

  You don’t. Work with what you’ve got and stop obsessing over changing your body into something it isn’t. No amount of drugs or special treatments is going to make you better at sports. Only your hard work and dedication to making yourself the best you personally can be will make you any better

  Nothing at first if you do it right. After a long time of doing wtc or over fences work though my inner thighs get tired, my core muscles like my abs, and my calves. Also if you’re riding for a long time like on a trail ride, even if you’re just walking, most of your other muscles don’t get tired but your butt gets sore from being seated so long.

   the dropping the penis out of the sheath  bit happened to a friend of mine who had her first lesson she got it into her head it was her boobs that caused it lol

  Lmaoooo that’s hilarious 😂 That’s probs not the reason haha but that reminds me of this horse that I used to know from an old barn I worked at. I once worked with a gelding who would not only drop, but like actually get a boner every time you fed him grain...like food actually turned him on apparently it was kinda nasty but also low key funny that he was so excited to just eat food
  "
227673,"
   whats a sheath?
  ","
  It’s the part of a male horse that holds their penis. It’s the outside part and their actual wiener is inside of it. If you see a male horse (regardless if he’s gelded or not) with his wiener sucked in like normal and not hanging out, all you’ll be able to see is a lump kinda thing between his back legs. That’s the sheath
  "
227674,"
   what do you give your horses for a treat
  ","
  They like the usual apples and carrots, peppermints, fed them sugar cubes once or twice, handfuls of grass from their pasture, and these store-bought peppermint flavored horse cookies. They’re pink! It’s cute and I think those are Chance’s favorite.
  
  One time I homemade some treats using oats, shredded carrots, molasses, and a peppermint candy! Those were a big hit with the ponies for sure :) made a YouTube video about making those if you’re interested! If not it’s all good my dude thanks for the good question

  Oh haha I mean, it’s not embarrassing. They’re animals, they just do it when they need to lol. But yeah I guess some people might be put off by horses gastric functions like passing gas or pooping. Sometimes male horses drop their penis down out of their sheath when they’re just chillin being relaxed and some people find it gross. Or if a mare is in heat they squirt and squeal and make a fuss at the male horses (even if they’re only around  neutered males).

   Humans were enslaved for hundreds of years and we could communicate with each other, we can see if an animal is suffering yet we keep doing it, what makes you think things will change immediately?
  ","
  There’s a difference between enslavement and outright murder for consumption on a mass scale...humans have never forcibly raped eachother over and over again, forcing someone to become pregnant and have babies for their entire lives only to rip away each child and do it again so we could steal milk from them until they were too tired to go on and died....but that’s what factory dairy farms do.
  
  It’s easy to see the distress in an animal but it’s also apparently extremely easy to also write it off as “just an animal” with no feelings because it cannot say in English “I am in pain, I am in desperation, please stop”.
  
  The difference is, to me, if animals could communicate using words then it would suddenly become a bigger moral issue because then humans would have to answer directly for killing animals by the millions, crammed in hot, smelly, houses, for the sole purpose of consuming them because we could understand without certainty that we were harming an intelligent and sentient creature.
  
  It’s the same reason why people condemned sea world’s dolphin and orca shows. It’s because we realized those animals were extremely intelligent and were distressed and bored and that it was cruel to make them jump around every day for treats like we did. We know that with certainty, so there was public outcry. That’s what I think would happen if all animals could talk. I just think it would happen much quicker since words are what humans understand the easiest
  "
227872,"

  "
227874,"
   You have some odd questions... but okay.  

I was kinda surprised by your response.  As ranchers,  there wasn't a day that past that we didn't try the food, before feeding it to the livestock.   We could taste the mold, faster than we could see it.  We didn't swallow it.
  ","
  Yeah ikr. People love asking me the weirdest stuff...
  
  Haha anyways, cattle and horse feed tastes a whole lot better than dog food imo lol. Call me crazy but I used to straight up eat the horse’s barley and oats at the farm when I used to forget my lunch sometimes haha. Sweet feed kinda tastes like crap though 😂
  
  That’s neat that you tested the food every day! As I’ve come to understand, aren’t cows a lot less susceptible to having health issues caused by mold than horses are because of their multiple stomach and ability to vomit? A lot of the local farmers here feed their cows round bales and stuff that have sat out in the rain all summer and winter and they don’t seem affected, whereas I know you could NEVER do that with a horse cause they’d probably colic or get respiratory issues

  It’s all about confidence. Fake it until you make it and you’ll just get used to it. Just like the recent ask I just answered, that’s just another hurdle you need to jump over in your life. One day you’re going to realize that nobody’s looking at you, nobody will remember any dumb things you say after like a day, the things you say aren’t as dumb as you think (or aren’t dumb at all), nobody is judging you, and you don’t need to over analyze every single second of every day. None of that matters and it never did. Don’t feel like you need to apologize for so many things. You are worthy, you deserve to exist, you deserve to fill your own space, and being quiet is okay. If you have something to say then say it, and if you don’t then don’t.

How often do you think that works? Percentage of time in your opinion?
  ","
  Like 3% idk. Being too forward can come off as hella creepy. Just being nice and having a conversation over the course of your meeting/time together and getting her snap or something at the end is much more casual and way less creepy.
  
  Some women can feel pressured in those situations where men act very forward and they might be afraid to say “no” in fear of how he might respond. Not necessarily saying you’d do this of course, but some guys get angry or salty when they’re rejected and they act out. It’s just an extremely awkward and potentially dangerous situation for a lady to be put in, so sometimes some people end up giving out their number or whatever without really wanting to. LOTS of my friends have said that to me and it’s happened to me before too

  No. If someone cannot imagine a situation from the perspective of another, they have a psychiatric condition called psychopathy. You can’t un-teach psychopaths, their brain is wired incorrectly. It’s a “disease” of a sort with no cure.

  ","
  I don’t like it when some men act pushy and angry/salty with me when I decline their advances. I don’t like that the word “no” means nothing to some people, like what “no” really means to them somehow is “try again”. Or how my own refusal of their advances isn’t enough to make them stop, but if I say “I have a boyfriend” they’re more likely to leave me alone. It’s like they respect a man they’ve never met or seen more than they respect me telling them I’m not interested standing right in front of them...

   Is a farm (with horses and stuff) a good investment if I become a millionaire?
  ","
  No probably not. If you’re in it to make money then you’ll probably be disappointed. Animals don’t tend to make people loads of money. That’s why most farmers you see aren’t rolling in riches.
  
  I don’t have much experience with cow or chicken or pig farms, but I know a lot more about the equestrian side of things.
  
  People who DO end up making it big off of equestrian sports do it by spending their entire lives learning how to train and sell top performance animals and sometimes (not always) the welfare of the animals falls to the wayside as people become greedy for more money
  
  If it’s a passion of yours then it’s a worthwhile investment. If it’s not, then it’s a money pit.
  "
228212,"

  "
228219,"
   Do you expect you boyfriend to protect you at all times? What about if y’all encounter a bear alone with no weapons?
  ","
  Lmao no that’s dumb. I’m capable of handling my own self in most situations I encounter. I’m not a helpless, fragile, princess, made of glass. His support and backup is definitely always appreciated, but I would never solely rely on him to fight my battles for me (even though I know he would in a heartbeat, he’s the best)
  
  As for the beast encounter situation: Sandy is just a person and he’s not stronger than a bear. If we encountered a bear I would sit in his shoulders and make both of us look really big and scary to the bear and we’d both shout at the bear to scare it away. If that didn’t work then we’d try to back away from it and get somewhere safe.
  
  If none of that worked I guess we’d both get mauled. Bears are faster, stronger, better at climbing, and better at tracking than people are. If a bear wants you dead you’re about to frickin die my dude 🤷🏽‍♀️

  Not really sure what you mean by that but I have a feeling that if the women around you aren’t taking to your attitude it might be a little too desperate, might be a bit r/niceguys worthy, or you may be trying too hard for ladies that just aren’t interested in you.
  
  If she says no then don’t keep trying. Just move on, ya know? Doing more and hanging around waiting for her/them to appreciate “the things you do for love” is sad. Courage is a dog...you’re a person...it’s not the same dynamic.
  
  Obvi I don’t know you or them and I’ve never interacted with you in person so I don’t know what’s really up, but maybe just be yourself and stop trying so hard or expecting people to owe you a date or something just for being nice to them.

   What about with your parents?
  ","
  My mom thinks it’s all silly and hasn’t ever seen anything but my dad said he and his sister (my aunt) have both had several encounters with paranormal beings. I can’t ask my aunt because she’s since passed away but my dad said she used to live in a house that was at one point converted into a makeshift civil war hospital. Said she told him on the phone once how her kids used to play with “the nice man” who my aunt thought was an imaginary friend. She THOUGHT he was anyways...
  
  Well, one day when her kids were upstairs playing while she was doing laundry, she heard a scream from the attic where her kids had been playing pretend in front of their huge bay windows. She rushed upstairs to find that even though she’d thought she’d locked it, the giant windows were flung open, but both kids were safe and sound sitting on the floor as usual. She asked them what had happened and her daughter replied that she was playing by the window and pressed up against the old glass to look out on the yard but it opened and she fell out and screamed! My aunt was confused because her daughter was obviously right there, and was unhurt, so she asked how she’d gotten back inside and why she wasn’t injured and her daughter told her she was okay because the “nice man” had saved her.
  
  My aunt thought she was just exaggerating or just playing pretend again so she locked the window and went downstairs to keep doing laundry. My dad then told me that she said she needed to put another load of dirty laundry into the machine, so she opened the basement door where it was located and turned on the light to go down the stairs and put it in but stopped dead in her tracks when she saw a strange, tall, man dressed in blue whom she’d never met standing at the base of the stairs and smiling up at her. It scared her to death and she dropped the dirty laundry and slammed the door shut! When she reopened it a minute later he was gone. Apparently that was the very last time her kids mentioned “the nice man” and she never saw him again

   When was the last time you rode on a bike? In your opinion, how well suited would the area around where you live be for someone who wanted to commute by bike? 🚴‍♀️
  ","
  It’s been ages since I rode a bike. Probably a good 2 years or so. It’s not an activity I usually find super fun or interesting, idk.
  
  If you wanted to commute on a bike  to any retail or restaurant job in my immediate area it would be perfect since we have loads of paved walking and biking trails around us that connect the neighborhoods and run next to the main roadways to the shopping centers.
  
  If you have any sort of career based job then it’s usually in the big city and it’s much too far away to bike every day. It’d take you hours to get there.

  First time I ever ever saw anything paranormal was when I was extremely little laying down in my room at night. I was waiting for the tooth fairy to come and take my front tooth from under my pillow and leave me a quarter so I was trying to stay awake for as long as possible so I could see her. I was so excited! Around 3 am I actually did see her that night!...a small glowing blueish orb that floated from one side of the room to the other...I closed my eyes real tight after I watched her float across the room and pulled the blanket up over my nose because it got kinda cold! I remember getting the chills because I was just so excited! Now looking back on it and knowing what I know now about paranormal activity it was definitely some sort of ghostly encounter. Apparently blue orbs followed by cool breezes are much more common than fully manifested human forms aka like full-on ghosts. That’s not the only time I ever saw anything but it IS the first I ever remember

   why do you love animals but eat animals 🤷‍♂️
  ","
  Why do you think feces is gross but still take shits? It’s because it’s been culturally normalized, people have been doing it for thousands of years, and it’s benefitted our species. Eating some animal proteins is beneficial for my continued existence. A little meat every week supplementing a mostly plant-based diet is healthy for a human and in order not to die people need to eat certain proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Meat just happens to be a great way to acquire some of those. Switching over to an omnivorous diet that included cooked meat was the vehicle that took early humans from being upright-walking, hairy, apes, to more intelligent and more organized versions of ourselves like the Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal.
  
  Granted, I dislike the way factory farmed animals are treated nowadays and the conditions they’re subjected to, but I don’t have the means to be a vegan as of now sadly.  Also I like chicken nuggets they’re good af 🤷🏽‍♀️

   What Can U Say About Arabian Horse!??
  ","
  Arabian horses are strong, high spirited, and quick on their feet. They’re considered a hot-blood breed which means that they were bred for their speed and endurance abilities. They originate from the Arabian Peninsula and are easily recognized by their high set neck, high-held tail, and (in some individuals more than others) their dished noses. Arabians are smart and make great riding horses

   Which one rolls around in the mud, knowing they'll get washed, dried and brushed? Which one hogs the fresh oats, frequently? Which one is the hugger? 
Which one has won the most ribbons? 
Which one has the most bad days? And anything else you want to add?
  ","
  Chance loves mud but not so much being washed. We can only do that in the summer though. They both don’t mind brushing and grooming stuff...actually I feel like they probably like it :)
  
  Neither eats oats, but Chance eats sweet feed and his hoof growth supplement. Max doesn’t eat grain and can’t have any of Chance’s bc of the hoof medicine in it although he tries his best to bully Chance into letting him have some when he can.
  
  They’re not mine and they’re more like country pasture pets that sometimes go on trail rides so I don’t think they’ve ever competed a day in their lives. Max is too swaybacked and old to learn to do much more than trail ride. It’s not his mental state, it’s his body. Not too sure of his history but my guess is poorly fitting tack, riders that were too heavy, bad nutrition, and age have made his back muscles atrophy more than normal and caused him to have a much weaker back that says in the middle. The most he can do is WTC and not very beautifully or in balance...it makes his stride very short and choppy and awkward. If I had more time I know I could work with Chance enough to get him to a point where we could show in local shows but I don’t have the resources or time.
  
  Max has the most bad days because he’s an abuse case. He wasn’t treated nicely by his previous owners and he’s just very afraid of everything. It’s not his fault but it gets in the way of things we want to do sometimes when he gets overwhelmed by seemingly trivial or simple things. He just needs a friend and time to relax to show him that everything is okay

  The crushing workload of subjects that are essentially just weeder classes.

I hate the amount of info we have to learn that I know is going to be irrelevant in the long-term or having to learn info that I know I won’t use ever again. I hate having to jump through hoops and cause myself so much stress just to get a piece of paper that says I’m worth a shit. Schooling isn’t about teaching students skills for the real world, it’s about showing employers that you can keep your head down and do the work they give you well under pressure of a deadline no matter what. So dumb :/

  I don’t like balloons. They make terrible noises, look ugly whenever they pop, and they’re fucking awful for the environment. They kill 100,000,000’s of sea creatures every year by suffocating them, getting stuck in their stomachs and starving them to death, trapping them in their strings and shards of popped balloon pieces and entangling them so they sit and wait to die because they can’t break free....Fuck balloons. Balloons are gross and should be illegal to release outdoors.

   What is your horoscope?
  ","
  Oct 26, 2020 - You and someone close could disagree on an issue that both of you feel strongly about. Stubborn pride on both your parts could keep you from working things out. Let it go, Pisces. It isn't worth ruining your relationship. Someone you know might be headed for divorce or moving away, and the news could be a shock to you. This should be a day of surprises - not all of them pleasant.

  Dogs are most likely much smarter than cats. “Dogs, it turns out, have about twice the number of neurons in their cerebral cortexes than what cats have, which suggests they could be about twice as intelligent”.

  ","
  Not sure if this is some sort of euphemism or not. If it is, I’m not into it. Not interested in topics about personal things like that.
  
  But if we’re really talking about flowers... then obviously I decline because you coming into my property without my permission, killing my expensive plants, and presenting me with my OWN flowers (which I spent time cultivating and caring for) sounds rude in the highest regard. Definitely uncalled-for, uncouth, inappropriate, and impolite. Especially rude since giving a lady a flower is considered a romantic gesture and it’s publicly known that I’m in a committed relationship. Very awkward and would put me (and you) in an uncomfortable situation where I’d have to reject you....just a big “no” all around lol

   no sorry, i mean like for them to gallop if you know what i meam i never would hit anyone least of all animals
  ","
  Oh okay I see what you mean! But still no lol.
  
  If I want to ask them to gallop, I get them up into a trot by squeezing them with my legs (like they were a giant tube of toothpaste between my legs) and clucking sounds.
  
  Then once they’re trotting at a good pace, I shorten my reins to an appropriate length, I take my two-point position (like a jockey), I squeeze them with my legs in a special way that tells them which lead to take, and I give them a few clucks and kiss sounds and say “gallop”. Kinda hard to explain in words without being able to show someone :P

  No, I don’t. Hitting them wouldn’t accomplish anything. They don’t understand that. In a competition of strength the horse will always win, so it’s just pointless and cruel to smack them around or hit or punch them for not understanding something, doing the wrong thing, or for acting up.

  I already talked about that. For clarification, again, ingesting livestock steroids is TERRIBLE for your health and an EXTREMELY DUMB idea.
  
  It has been clinically tested and will give you heart problems and chest pain, makes your testicles smaller and causes your body to produces less testosterone, causes erectile dysfunction, drops sperm count, can cause you to break a hip at random due to a condition called “aseptic necrosis of the femoral head”, may increase your chances of going bald, and can possibly cause crazy mood swings (also dubbed roid rage).
  

  All in all, avoid steroids or “juicing” or whatever people call it. You might look buff but who the hell cares if you’re destroying your body to do it. So dumb.

   Do you think a zorse is more like a zebra or horse? Like how well would it fend for itself in the wild? (Africa safari)
  ","
  Zorses are typically bred using a female zebra and a male horse and most often inherit the flighty, aggressive, temperaments of their zebra mothers along with her small stature and striped coat pattern, so I’d say they’re more similar to zebras.
  
  Zorses are most often considered to be extremely difficult to train when started young and almost impossible to train when they’re older because of their completely opposite personality to most domestic horses. Just like mules, zorses are also born sterile and are unable to reproduce due to the mismatch in number, shape, and size of chromosomes present in their bodies resulting from having two different species as parents.
  
  As far as surviving in the wild, I’m not sure. Since there are no wild zorses to study, horses and wild zebras don’t share the same natural habitat, and matings between the two species do not occur naturally, I’m most inclined to say a zorse wouldn’t fare well on its own in the wild and would most likely fall victim to predation pretty quickly.

  ","
  In general:
  
  Do you cling to ideas and concepts, refusing to change your opinion after hearing updated or new information when it’s contradictory to your original opinion?
  
  Do you prioritize your own feelings, thoughts, and perceptions of the world over both the feelings of others and over fact and reproducible, peer reviewed, scientific information?
  
  Are you irrationally afraid of or made uncomfortable by change, people with differing world views, new ideas, scientific progress, progressive social movements like pride and blm, or do you use any part of your belief system or religion to put others down for living differently than you?
  
  If any or all of those things apply to you, you’re closed minded. Please re-evaluate the way you conduct yourself and assess the negative effects your behavior has on the ones you love and others in your community.
  
  If not, congrats! You’re not a jerk and you know how to express empathy, are open to new ideas, know how to show compassion, and can think for yourself! If none of these apply to you, you’re open minded.

  Everyone should close the toilet seat all the way because that’s the most sanitary and courteous way to leave the restroom.

  ","
  Uh idk. Haha I don’t really like the idea of them fighting since they’re such good boys and they’re actually pretty good friends.
  
  But if they did fight I think it would be pretty evenly matched. Max is pretty feisty and boisterous and kind of a bully even though he’s much smaller than Chance so he’d probably have a fighting shot at winning if he could get in a few critical hits since he’s so quick and fiery unlike Chance. Chance is much bigger, heavier, and stronger than Max though so I think if Chance ever actually got a kick or stomp in he could make it a tko in one hit if he tried hard enough. He isn’t very kicky or spooky or bitey tho tbh, so I’ve never actually seen him try to defend himself. Whenever Max kicks at him or anything he kinda just looks unbothered and just stares at him lol.
  
  I think Chancellor would win with one good kick if he felt like it, but most likely he’d win by just standing there and letting Maximilian tire himself out lmao

  I don’t think talent or skill is the issue. Personally, I know I could do my best to try to get the zebra used to tacking up and having a rider on its back...but it would never be a safe, ridable, happy, and dependable animal that wanted to build a friendship and relationship with you like a domestic horse would. It’s in their psychology and body structure.
  
  Zebras aren’t wired the same as domesticated horses since they haven’t had thousands of years of artificial breeding to select out their naturally fearful nature and small builds. It would honestly just be cruel to try and force them into a situation that would make them uncomfortable like that imo
  
  I mean, could any asshole just scare and force the animal into being subservient for a while just to sit on it just to say you “rode” it? Yeah I guess. But what I’m saying here is thats totally messed up and I don’t want any part of it.

  No. There’s a reason humans have not been able to domesticate and therefore ride or use zebras as pack animals.

  "
228611,"
   Wow, interesting. What are your issues with horse racing?
  ","
  I have a few gripes about the industry as a whole that just really bother me and turn me off from horse racing. Even if not every single racehorse trainer is outright abusive to their animals, the extreme physical toll that running so fast takes on the horses’ bodies results in poor health and injury that can even result in the death of the horse. Horses were never meant to run that fast or for so long. It’s people who have bred them to be that way and it’s people who are stressing horse’s bodies to their breaking points. The idea in general seems almost cruel to me.
  
  I also have a distaste for the general poor treatment of the vast majority of animals running races who aren’t top winners, for how many horses a year die at racetracks as a result of being pushed too hard or from being mishandled, and the fact that horses are raced while they’re very young(1-3 years old) before their bones are developed and fused enough to carry a rider or properly absorb the shocks of galloping at top speed over long distance.
  
  I hate the way that so many horses essentially get discarded when they don’t win like pieces of garbage left to rot out in a back field somewhere or sent to slaughter to make dog food. The culture of horse racing which treats the animals like pawns in a game designed to make money with no regard for the welfare of the animals also really bothers me and makes me feel uncomfortable. Not to mention the shortcuts, cruelties, and seedy medical practices like pin firing that are also happening behind the scenes just so people can feel like they’re getting ahead or to force the horse to ignore pain in order to make them more money.
  
  Not sure if it’s the case anymore, but I know jockeys historically haven’t been treated particularly well either and have starved themselves and lived on low wages to make weight and get by.

  ","
  Balloons are wasteful, silly,  and awful for the environment. They should be illegal to release outdoors.
  
  Every single balloon that’s ever been released has (or will) fall back down to earth after it’s reached the upper layers of our atmosphere and popped. Most of the time they end up in the oceans. Soft plastic pollution is killing sea life of all kinds by the thousands every day when they either ingest it by mistake, get tangled in it and starve because they’re bound up, or get it wrapped around their necks or stuck in their throats and die from asphyxiation.

   my boyfriend is 18 hes in the us navy and before u say i thought you said you didnt have one well my he was my ex and he wanted me back after i broke up with him n didnt talk for a year. he says im controlling because i got angry with him for being busy and he is but i dont say it n it really hurts.
  ","
  Aight well if you don’t want him to think you’re controlling don’t be mad over dumb shit, learn to trust in your partner more and have some confidence in yourself as well, and communicate more openly with him about both of your feelings. Sounds to me like you’re both being immature in this situation. No hate, just outside perspective based on only the info you just said in your ask.
  
  Also girl I don’t like giving dating advice but forreal getting back with your ex is dumb as shit. Y’all broke up for a reason...plus you said he’s only 18? And in the military? NO! Big red flags for me. Boys act like hot-headed idiots until they’re like 25-30. It takes dudes forevvveeerrr to mature unlike girls.
  
  You didn’t exactly ask, but if I were you I’d break up with him ASAP and give yourself some space and time to do you and chill and work on yourself if you need it. Fuck dating a navy guy. My dad was in the navy so I’ve literally seen all kinds and young guys tend to want to be wild and crazy and live a bachelors life and they also tend to get sent traveling places and don’t have a choice where they go so you’d have to be long distance most likely and that in itself can be a whole ‘nother issue

I’ve also tried all the basic types of wine like red, pink, white, champagne...I really like this one German Christmas wine called Glühwein! It’s made with cloves and oranges and sugar and you boil it on the stove and serve it warm. It’s pretty dang good on a cold day especially. They serve it a lot at outdoor Christmas markets so I have lots of fond memories drinking it there.

  It’s a partnership. Both parties have their own jobs and it isn’t about control.
  
  You give cues that the horse willingly follows. For the rider it’s about balancing on the horse and holding  your own self up with no tension or force. It’s about knowing when is a suitable time to give a cue, where you both are in space, and how to ask your horse to follow your directions.
  
  For the horse it’s holding himself up and in balence, supporting your weight, listening for you, and thinking about where  his body is in space.

  You need to fully master every single basic skill and be completely balanced in the saddle before you learn to jump your horse lol.
  
  Please don’t try jumping unless you already know the basics. Otherwise you WILL hurt your horse on accident or yourself.
  
  Assuming you have the basics: This unfinished infographic (I didn’t add the words to yet) shows the correct jumping position with balanced horse and rider in the top left, and then 3 incorrect rider positions with unbalanced horse and rider. If you’re unbalanced then your horse will not be able to jump well and will be unbalanced and risks injury to you both

Does it matter what people think of you?
  ","
  Yeah sort of but mostly no not at all lol
  
  Being accepted by your fellow people is an important part of a healthy and happy human psyche! So to a very small extent, yeah it kinda-sorta matters what others that are close to you think of you in that you need to get along well with others around you and have them form positive opinions of you in order not to be lonely and have friends.
  
  But it DOESN’T really matter what other people outside of your group think of you like social media followers, strangers, etc. The human brain was built to seek acceptance and positive interaction so we could help each other, share, and survive... but we weren’t built to be equipped to deal with so so many thoughts and opinions of us at once. That explains why rando’s negative or hateful internet comments are so detrimental to some people’s mental health even though they’ll probably never even meet that hater and they know their rude comment is irrelevant

   Is it bad for me to be a Christian and still support the the lgbbtq club?
  ","
  Ok so like, this is gonna be a long answer but I wanna explain my reasoning if that’s okay!
  
  To answer your question: No it’s not bad it’s good to be supportive of your fellow people no matter their preferences for a partner! Supporting and loving thy neighbor no matter his/her appearance, gender, sexual preference, or race is the most Christian thing you could do! God preaches love, not hate!
  
  I think some people get confused when interpreting that specific part of the Bible and that there’s still a lot of negative stigma surrounding lgbtq put there by the church that’s leftover from the Middle Ages when they were very focused on creating child-producing marriages and on population growth since everyone died so young back then since they didn’t have good medicine. Basically, I’ve come to understand that they saw that homosexual relationships didn’t produce children, so therefor they’re were seen as “bad” and “pointless” by lots of people back then... plus the church used its power and influence to  control the dumb uneducated masses of people by taxing, tithing, and offering indulgences to sinners and used fear of going to hell as punishment for not doing what they said because then you’d be “going against gods word” (aka undermining their influence)  Basically they scared people into conforming to what benefitted them for a long time in history. Things like being gay were “bad” back then because it didn’t benefit them monetarily or society for population stabilization.  Now we have food medicine and lots of people so that ideology is totally pointless now. Still though, all that historical talk just furthered the negative stigma around being homosexual and it became ingrained into the collective human memory.
  
  Imo, with all these social movements and stuff about gay rights, we’re now realizing that it was men who corrupted the word of god for their own benefit back then, and what I think God wanted the whole time was acceptance and love of all thy neighbors.
  
  The echoes of that time where people shunned and demonized lgbtq people can still be heard today pretty loudly, especially in small towns and places that are more focused on traditional, conservative, values that are passed down from generation to generation. Information is just slower to disseminate in small places like that because most flow of info is centered around big cities with lots of influx of new people and ideas.
  
  Honestly there’s a lot lot lot to unpack from different biblical interpretations, different historical precedents and times that shaped our own time now, historical events and social norms that influenced the church’s teachings, and the echoes of those old ways that are still influential in how we tbink today...like honestly way too much for an ask post
  
  It really boils down to one thing for me though and it’s-   if all people are children of god and god loves and accepts all his children, then it seems (to me) he would want you to  do the same thing as well.

  Haha nah jk jk but actually though, taking a GENUINE and actual interest and having curiosity in what she does with them would go a long way and make her feel supported and impressed that you cared about something she likes doing! Ask questions and try to learn stuff about it so you two can talk about it!
  
  If you wanted to take a it a step further and really wow her you could try learning to be gentle enough to ride a horse right next to her on the trail and go on a romantic trail ride! It sweeps me off my feet when my bf does that with me. Now it’s something we do every so often together and he’s learning to control the horse better with less effort. It’s super neat and it worked with me lol so I bet it’ll work with your gf

   Aww! ❤️ we have a ton of country roads here where there is hardly any traffic, so we take those a lot and go to some trails down from us. The spot I’m mentioning has beautiful waterfalls ❤️

  I LOVE riding trails! It’s always a blast. Going to waterfalls seems so relaxing, that’s crazy cool you get to do that casually.
  
  There are some forest trails near me and ones that go through the neighbor’s cow pasture on top of the hill that I like going to sometimes. I like the fields cause when he cuts down the grass during hay season you can gallop for a good long stretch over the flat ground where he drives the tractor. It’s one of my favorite feelings, just running free up on the hill and being so close to the sky 😍😍😍

   I’ve always wondered what horse steroids would do to a player considering that there are always some college football players on (cattle) juice & chemicals, and if there was much of a difference if someone used race horse steroids.

   What would happen if a human athlete took horse steroids for a year?
  ","
  I’m inclined to say that would be incredibly stupid and have negative side effects. After some research I found out that my inclination was right. The pic below is a screenshot from an article called “Cattle Steroid Misuse Appears Common”. After scientific study, it was concluded that there are indeed negative side effects of its use in humans. Read the caption/pic below for a few of those.
  
  I also found out that steroids for use in horses, cattle, dogs, and cats, known as Prednisolone Acetate, can cause premature birth or birth defects when taken by pregnant animals, so the same could be assumed for pregnant human athletes if they consumed it.

   If the sun is in space why is there light on earth an not space
  ","
  There is light in space, it just doesn’t have anything to reflect/bounce off of and enter into your eye for you to see it. That’s why the moon becomes illuminated, the space station, satellites, comets, etc, because the light is reflecting off of them and letting you see them. Where there’s nothing to reflect off of, you don’t see light, explaining why the space around the sun without objects in it is perceived as dark.

   which is your fave max or chance
  ","
  Chance is my favorite of the 2 because Max is afraid of everything and tends to be super jumpy and unsure of himself whereas Chance couldn’t care less about anything and is super chill. Plus Max is really sway-backed from old age, little exercise over his lifetime, and poorly fitting tack all his life too (which makes him a little less comfy to sit on) Chance is a fatty so he’s super soft to sit on 😂
  
  It’s not really Max’s fault for being such a spook tho. I know it’s cause his previous owners neglected him, left him alone in a pasture with no socialization, and they beat him a lot and forced him to do stuff he didn’t understand and now he expects to be hit and yelled at all the time. It’s just gonna take a long, long, time of building trust and friendship with him for him to calm down and stop being so afraid of new stuff and places. Until then we’ll just have to let him deal with it by bucking and rearing and jumping around like a crazy pony until he can calm tf down and realize everything is cool lmao 😆

  Everything is made of energy.
  
  Anxiety is un-acted upon potential. You become worried and get stuck in your head because you feel you could’ve done better!
  
  Depression is un-acted upon motivation. You get depressed and don’t want to do anything at all, but the reason you’re depressed is because you’re stagnant, under stimulated, and unmotivated.
  
  Turning such negative emotions around and giving them a positive spin was extremely helpful to me and very good advice.

   Is it wise to ride a horse bare back
  ","
  Several factors come into play when considering whether it is wise or not to ride your horse bareback:
  
  1. Your own riding skill level – are you balanced correctly and can you remain balanced through any unexpected  movements? Are you effective in your legs, hands, seat, and voice or do you get nervous easily and shut down? Are your muscles strong enough to remain engaged but not grip the horse for extended periods of time?
  
  2. Is your horse used to the sensation of riding tackless? Have you ever tried it before? The feeling of a rider with a saddle is different than the feeling of a rider without one and may be somewhat confusing for some horses the first time it’s introduced
  
  3. What is your horse’s demeanor- calm or prone to spooks? Will riding bareback be a safe option for you based on this (and your ability to cope)?
  
  4. What is the status of your horses back health? Are they well-muscled and in shape, bony and elderly, or sway-backed? Being able to support your weight over a strong and capable set of latissimus dorsi muscles is important. Riding bareback is not as comfortable for either of you if your horse has a weak or bony back
  
  If you meet all these conditions, riding bareback is not harmful or unwise and can be quite fun and freeing for both horse and rider!

   What is your opinion on Old town road lyrics? Is it cruelty for horses?
  ","
  Old Town Road is a stupid ass song about cheating on your girlfriend and doing drugs set to an upbeat rhythm so people like it anyways, but it doesn’t have a message about cruelty to animals.
  
  If you’re referring maybe to the lyric where he says “ride till I can’t no more” I think he’s talking about not being able to sit up straight cause he’s so intoxicated. Alternatively he could mean until he’s too tired, but forreal it doesn’t take that long for a rider to get tired when even just walking around on the horse. Your seat gets sore after like 2 hours lol. Riding is difficult!

   do you put mask over ur horses face? do you know what i mean by that... i seen this one youtuber
  ","
  Horses cannot catch severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aka COVID-19. It’s not zoonotic, meaning it’s a people disease that can’t transfer to/get animals sick. The virus doesn’t survive in other animals like it does in people.
  
  When asked about the subject of masking your pets in public, liscenced veterinarians Dr. Natalie Marks and Dr. Keri Bayley both advised against the practice. They both agreed that there is not enough air circulation nor room in masks for pets to breathe properly because of the shape of their noses and faces, unlike people. Because pets cannot contract or spread the disease, the point is mute anyways.
  
  The veterinarians also stated that masking pets also restricts their access to water, which can be dangerous, as pets including horses, cannot tell us when they’re thirsty, and dehydration could lead to severe health risks.

  The Tice Family Farm lol it’d be a farm-stay experience. Like a resort where you go and stay a few days to “experience farm life”. Rich city yuppies LOVE that shit.

They were just amazed at the animals, it was weird and kinda sad that they’d never even looked at stuff like a chicken before irl...but sooo easy to profit off of lol.
  
  Our little place would have farm animals you could pet/interact with like goats, sheep, donkeys, chickens, cows, and maayyybe a pigs. It’d have an equestrian facility to host trail rides (but also actual riding lessons as well). It’d have a vineyard, working dairy (w like 3 cows tho), some sort of farm kitchen/dining area for guests, and little tiny cottages to rent out for a week or weekend!

   How to avoid overthinking?
  ","
  Center yourself, meditate, take a deep breath, calm down first.
  
  Then step back and ask yourself what’re the most and least important things about the situation you’re stressing over. Is it even worth it?
  
  If it is then take a step back and try to look at everything objectively like a third party would. Don’t overdo that step.
  
  After you’re done, stop thinking about it. Remind yourself that what happened in the past can’t be solved or changed by worrying in the future. Nobody will remember the dumb thing you said or did in a week, and nothing you’re over analyzing now will even be relevant in the future. Live and learn :)

  Horses help us to learn about ourselves- they act as a mirror to our emotions, the energies we emit... even though sometimes we don’t always like what we see, horses never lie in that respect.

  There are probs more ways they show affection than this, but here are a few I noticed:
  
  Coming up to see you when you’re walking in the field without being asked/called, keeping their ears and eyes turned toward you a lot when you’re with them, acting relaxed and maintaining a soft facial expression when you’re with them, following you around, blowing into your face and smelling your nose (it’s the horse version of a handshake or waving hello to someone), nickering or whinnying at you when you come up to them, and willingly following your directions!
  
  Those are all telltale signs that your horse likes you, trusts you lots, and considers you as a friend and leadership figure 💙🐴

  Kinda. The lobes of a horse’s liver are similar to humans’ except for horses have a bile duct that empties directly into the first part of their small intestine instead of having a gall bladder like people.
  
  Your gallbladder helps you to break down fatty foods like meat, especially red meat. That’s part of the reason why horses can’t eat a lot of meat without getting sick

  "

   Do you feed your horse 🐎 with chicken 🍗 and beef 🥩?
  ","
  No. Horses are obligate herbivores, meaning they’re unable to process large amounts of any kind of meat. Horse’s livers are not equipped to deal with or flush out any sort of meat proteins, so featuring meat as a regular part of a horses diet would cause them to get sick

   Do you train your horse like you train your dog ? 🐎 🐕
  ","
  A lot of the concepts transfer over quite well. Both horses and dogs are pretty intelligent creatures that require social companionship to survive and need someone to look to as their trusted leader figure.
  
  One aspect of horses that is very different from dogs though is that they’re fight-or-flight prey animals, where as dogs are predatory pack animals. People are also predatory pack animals, so when training a horse you need to think about how your training requests are portrayed in their eyes and adjust your behavior so they don’t get too overwhelmed or afraid. It’s sort of hard to explain in a concise way lol.

  Of course no problem! Horse riding is my passion so I’m always excited to share it with people :)
  
  About the horse racing though, I’m actually not a fan of it at all. There are a lot of questionable and, in my opinion, quite cruel things that happen behind the scenes at a lot of race tracks that I fervently disagree with. Even when owners try to treat their race horses fairly, the actual act of running races at such a high speeds for such a distance is extremely tough on a horse’s body and has a lot of detrimental effects :/ A lot of what happens to horses as a result of the racing industry is just awful so I don’t support it.

  Inside it’d have a master bedroom with a bathroom attached that had a big bathtub and a shower with all those crazy sprayers from all angles so it’d be like you were standing in a rainstorm when you took a shower! It’d have an open kitchen and living room floor plan with a gas fireplace and a finished basement area built into the hill with a wood burning heater to warm the house in extra cold months :)

  It depends on the reason you want them for, like what job are they gonna do? Each breed is more uniquely suited to different kinds of riding styles and/or jobs 🙂
  
  For example Warmbloods usually excel in things like eventing and at hunt seat riding, while Quarter Horses tend to really shine in the reining and western pleasure rings. Shetland Ponies do well in lead-line level classes and as pasture pals, while Percherons stand out in driving and farm-work roles. It all just depends lol

   yes I want to look into that, I Rode  a horse once at a young age and I was scared to death of falling lol

  You should totally see what’s up with it! After you learn to relax your nerves and your body and get proper balance, everything else follows naturally!
  
  Can’t remember if i already said this or not but every barn I’ve ever attended/took riding lessons at I’ve found online. Just google riding facilities in your area to get started!
  
  I started off riding English style but later on took some lessons riding Western style too. In my opinion English style riding is more fun because you can eventually learn to jump with the horse, but western riding is equally fun if you’re just learning to ride on the flat (walk, trot, canter, gallop w/ no jumping).
  
  Riding lessons in my area usually go for about $35-40 for each one hour session. You show up with jeans and shoes with a low heel (like cowboy boots, not high heels lol) and they’ll provide the horse and equipment! Make sure you get yourself a good horse riding helmet! Some places will provide you with one but it’s always much safer to have one you know fits your head well. Plus then you don’t have to share nasty sweat germs with people.
  
  You’ll use muscles you didn’t even know you had lol its a great way to social distance, stay in shape, get outdoors, and be around nature!

  Yes, with restrictions on what websites they can use, similarly to what kind of website blocks are already used by school systems. Being able to keep in contact with the outside world would be extremely beneficial for inmates who are serving long sentences. It would allow inmates to take online classes, study new information, keep up with family more easily, and allow them to better themselves in order to be a more productive and marketable citizen when they get released instead of feeling overwhelmed and having no skills when they’re released, leading them to go back to illegal activity as their only means of survival. It could essentially help break the cycle!

  No, while that’s a humane and kind method of training too, I prefer to train not based off of food reward, but release of “pressure”. Anything can be considered pressure such as clucking, speaking a command word/phrase  like “walk on”, tapping or poking gently with your hand or the crop, your aids while riding, etc.
  
  Basically, gentleness and persistently asking the horse to do something in baby steps and increments is my favorite method. As soon as the horse even begins to start doing what I’m asking them, even if it’s not perfect or it’s just a step in the right direction, I stop asking and let them think about it. Then when they start to lick & chew and look at me again I begin asking them to repeat the motion. That way they associate “release of pressure” (aka I’ll stop bugging them) as its own reward!

  Horses are such large, heavy, animals that it would take an enormous amount of beer to get them drunk, which would be both expensive af and cruel, so I’m sure nobody would reverb want to attempt to do that to them.

  Unprocessed or very finely ground corn can give a horse colic which can result in death. Eating too much corn cal also cause problems for a horse’s feet like laminitis or founder.
  
  You’d have to buy corn that’s been specially processed to be able to be fed to horses. Horses wouldn’t do well eating normal cow or chicken feed that’s heavily corn based

You the slowest runner in the schoolyard? Suck at dodgeball? Practice and learn to get better! It will help you make yourself into a more well-prepared, well-rounded human.
  
  Kids nowadays, myself included, were taught that “everyone’s a winner” and that “we’re all equal” but then get into the workforce and realize that feeling entitled to “win” or to “get picked” won’t work anymore bc as adults nobody gives a shit if your feelings are hurt that you didn’t get picked and nobody gets participation trophies.  People end up getting frustrated because things are different than they were taught.

   signs that your horse is getting old?
  ","
  Horses generally live into their 30’s, so a great indicator that they’re getting old will be the condition of their teeth!
  
  Generally, with normal wear-and-tear, a natural, vertical, mark/line called the Galvayne’s groove will appear on the horse’s 3rd incisor tooth (sprouting from the gum line down) beginning when they are about 10 years old. When they are 20, this mark will extend all the way down the tooth. That’s a great indicator that your horse may be “getting old”.
  
  Many old horses also show signs of aging just like people do such as getting droopier skin, slowing down, losing muscle mass, decreased sight abilities, swayed back, losing a bit of hair, looking bonier, and getting grey hairs!

  Disagree entirely. Horse’s hooves are made of keratin, the same material your fingernails are made of. They can’t feel it, just like you can’t feel when you cut your nails. Horseshoes are also applied and custom fitted by a skilled craftsmen called a farrier. They have to go to school and attend lots of training to be able to practice that profession so they know exactly how to avoid hurting the horse in any way.

  If you could get money easily then hell yeah, but you won’t value it. If you have to work hard for it, it’ll make you a more grateful person with a better understanding of the value of things like money and time

   Do you consider office temps, part-time employees and on-the-job student trainees stupid and incompetent? Why?
  ","
  No...? Honestly I think this question is pretty stupid. I have no idea what would make an office temp or student or especially a part-time employee any less intelligent than a full time employee. Going into a position and not knowing everything or needing a bit of training is both very common and just fine. That doesn’t make anyone incompetent.

230467,"
   What do you girls talk about when you go to the ladies room?
  ","
  Usually ways that men made us feel uncomfortable during the night, collaborative strategies to mitigate contact with those people, maybe some gossip, or just casual small talk if nothings gone wrong and everyone is having a good time. Ladies typically go to the restroom in groups because it can be dangerous to leave a fellow female friend unattended or separated from the group. Especially in a crowded area like bars or clubs where alcohol is being served.

  Servers depend on tips for their income. The only time I wouldn’t tip a server is if I literally watched them spit in my food or they were extremely rude/condescending to me. Service being slow isn’t typically the waitstaff’s fault. Sometimes it’s busy and they’re stretched thin, I get that man. No worries.

   Are stand up comedians be considered as Clowns 🤡?
  ","
  Idk. Depends on your definition I guess but most comedians who are actually funny have to be extremely clever. To me clowns are supposed to be funny because they’re silly, use cheap tricks, act dumb, and slapstick humor; but good comedians are funny because they’re quippy, intelligent, and make you think

  Constructive criticisms help us to learn and grow. The same can’t be said for negative or hateful remarks, that’s where the word criticism gets many of its negative connotations from. But not all criticism is bad.

  No, he’s extremely used to all sorts of loud noises happening around him. He’s been trained to be used to traffic sounds, kids, dogs, lawnmowers, and commotion. He’s generally very safe and tolerant 😊He’s very “bombproof” lol. Basically that means nothing that normally bothers other horses really bothers or scares him.
  "
230509,"
   How often do you whip your horse?
  ","
  The subjects of whips and crops tends to become a complicated one if people don’t understand what their intended purpose is.
  
  Whips, crops, bats, whatever you prefer to call them, are only used as attention getters and behavior reinforcers. You should never tap your horse with the whip hard enough for it to hurt them, and also only in key areas. They’re meant to be used only as a reinforcing aid to your other aids: voice, legs, hands, and seat.
  
  That being said, with the horse I’m working with now, I very rarely need to use a crop while riding and have never actually had to tap him with it. Holding the crop in my hand and allowing him to see it has been sufficient in encouraging him to stretch down and move forward.

   Do wild horses have bad teeth?
  ","
  No, they eat a lot more fibrous and abrasive food than non-feral horses so they wear their teeth down a lot more, making them not as likely to become sharp. All horses are hypsodonts, meaning their teeth are both really long and they continuously erupt out of their gums as the wear down from chewing.
  
  Feral horses also eat a less sugar than non-feral horses because they have less access to it. (ie nobody to feed them peppermint treats, apples, or sugar cubes)

  "

   Well, it is considered to have a healthy diet to have some animal protein. Hardcore vegans suffer from vitamin B deficiency. Isn't it a good compromise to still have animal food products without the killing part?
  ","
  I’m neither vegan nor vegetarian and agree that people are meant to have a certain amount of protein in their diets that can most easily be acquired from animals, but I also have friends who are vegan and they’re able to maintain a balanced diet with no deficiencies, so it’s totally doable for sure.
  
  To address your second point, the animals used for animal product production are killed for meat anyways after they’re deemed “unusable” so it’s not a good compromise. For example cows who can’t produce milk anymore (after about 5 years of constant pregnancy and milking) are slaughtered for beef and chickens who get burnt out on laying eggs (around 1 or 2 years) are killed as well. Even if you, yourself aren’t eating meat, you’re still directly supporting the machine that pumps animals through it to produce meat.
  
  Meatless Monday’s and stuff is a noble cause, and technically that’s helping lessen the impact. But don’t go into it thinking that that’s going to save animals in the future. Basically if your reason to change your lifestyle is to save the animals then go all the way or don’t go at all lol

   How much does it cost to take care of a horse?
  ","
  If you already have the horse and all the equipment it needs for it’s care like water and feed buckets, pitchforks, riding equipment, etc, then it shouldn’t be more than an average car payment per month- like $200-$300. Around $4000 total a year in feed, board, farrier, vet, and dentist
  "
230596,"
   If someone believes that killing an animal to feed yourself is wrong when you have alternative means does that make them stupid?
  ","
  Base concept: not stupid at all. Actually a good idea! Humans are actually meant to eat a mostly plant-based diet anyways! If you don’t have to kill something, then don’t. That’s not stupid at all.
  
  My objections: If someone believes killing or harming animals to feed yourself is wrong then fine...but if you became a vegetarian for that specific reason, just to save animals from harm or suffering, then why would you continue to support the animal farming industry by continuing to consume animal products? That’s my gripe with a lot of  vegetarians who claim they became vegetarian “for the animals” because they believe killing is wrong. Okay but what about milk, eggs, cheese, etc? Those are considered vegetarian because they’re not meat products, but the production of all those things still brought harm and suffering to animals.
  
  To me it just sounds like half-assed veganism and honestly seems extremely hypocritical. Either go vegan or don’t.
