breathing, and indigestion. my depression makes me have zero appetite and causes me to become extremely fatigued.\n  ","409896":"\n  i don't believe it's predatory, but i do think it's an incredibly misinformed notion. you cannot help what your sexual orientation is, and if someone is heterosexual, they won't just magically turn bisexual or homosexual just because someone won't accept the fact that they're straight.\n  ","409897":"\n  that sounds like a delusion to me, to be perfectly honest. if he's going to great, irrational lengths to justify miley's behavior in an effort to claim that he can persuade her to be with him, then that could be indicative of an underlying problem.\n  ","409898":"\n  not among my close friends, no.\n  ","409899":"\n  my personal opinion is that you cannot love someone unless you know them personally. this man clearly doesn't know miley except for what is posted on social media, which isn't always reliable. he's infatuated with the idea of her.\n  \n  not to mention the fact that miley is happily married. he thinking he can win her over is disrespectful to her existing relationship.\n  ","409900":"\n  i don't check my cell phone at work unless i'm on my break. i don't get service in the office anyway.\n  \n  and yes, there are cameras in the office to monitor employee activity. which i think is a bit ridiculous, considering management uses it to meticulously watch people's actions in the office. however, i believe it may be useful in some situations if something gets stolen.\n  ","409901":"\n  yes, i agree that as long as he doesn't begin threatening her, then his wishes are harmless (although no doubt they're hurting him greatly).\n  \n  i don't agree with you regarding mental health, though. his mental health problems are probably what's causing his obsession in the first place, because you honestly cannot love someone if you don't actually know them. you can be infatuated with someone, but love goes on a deeper, more intimate level. he doesn't personally know miley or her personality besides what she broadcasts on social media.\n  ","409902":"\n  it's illegal when a fan becomes obsessive and delusional and begins breaking the law to try to pursue a celebrity. there are several cases of fans going to great lengths because they believe they're \"the one,\" which usually includes excessive stalking, threatening telephone calls or social media messages, etc etc.\n  \n  loving someone so much that it gives you anxiety or depression is not healthy, and this individual probably already has mental health issues that *need* to be addressed, otherwise his behavior will become more radical and dangerous.\n  ","409903":"\n  i don't generally get nervous talking about anything. i just feel more comfortable with those people, knowing that they won't tell my business to anyone else who doesn't deserve to know my life.\n  ","409904":"\n  no problem, i'm always here for advice whenever you need help with something.\n  ","409905":"\n  yes, i have two friends who i feel that way about, as well as one or two coworkers.\n  ","409906":"\n  i can understand why they feel that way. unfortunately, there isn't much the public can do though, not unless he begins breaking the law to try to get closer to her.\n  ","409907":"\n  i don't dislike you because you haven't done anything for me to develop such strong feelings like that. sometimes friendships simply fall apart over time, there's nothing you can do to stop it unless you try to take an active part in reviving the friendship and develop open communication with the person.\n  \n  however, it's a two-way street. if\n  \n   @IsoleAtlantic\n  \n  doesn't want to rekindle her feelings, there isn't much else you can do.\n  ","409908":"\n  it isn't something that overly worries me, or concerns me at all. when you're a famous, public figure, you will inevitably get obsessive fans. as long as he doesn't begin stalking or threatening her, i don't see it as a big deal.\n  ","409909":"\n  ROFL. no, that isn't something i would ever consider. i already have an idea in mind for my tattoo.\n  ","409910":"\n  i don't concern myself with other people's friendships

have royally screwed something up, lol.\n  \n  the mistake that i do often and would like to stop repeating is drinking alcohol on weeknights. i always regret it the following morning because i feel terrible, but i continue to do it every once in a while anyway.\n  ","409918":"\n  the best part of my friday was feeling accomplished & motivated after exercising.\n  ","409919":"\n  no, i don't have

","409930":"\n  aw, thank you. have a good night ~~\n  ","409931":"\n  i think it's important, but it isn't vital. after all, i have zero sense of self but i still exist, lol.\n  ","409932":"\n  i haven't had an argument with someone in a while, so i honestly don't remember.\n  ","409933":"\n  everyone has an ego to some degree. it just depends on whether or not you have an inflated ego, lol. having an inflated ego isn't generally seen as a good thing.\n  ","409934":"\n  like i said, it varies among individuals. there isn't so much a common thread anymore because people don't feel the need to have children out of obligation as much as they did in the past.\n  ","409935":"\n  it varies depending on the individual. some people simply want children while others feel the need to do so because of family pressure, which in my opinion isn't healthy. most people i know who have children have wanted them for a long time.\n  ","409936":"\n  for the most part, yes. there are only some aspects that aren't necessarily in my control, but i'm currently working towards gaining a better grip on them.\n  ","409937":"\n  i don't know if i want children at all.\n  ","409938":"\n  i envy people who have thin body types, but it doesn't really affect my own self image. i'm self conscious about my appearance but that's because i'm comparing myself to what i looked like ten years ago versus now.\n  ","409939":"\n  yes, i edit all of my photos prior to posting them. i don't like the natural brightness & contrast levels of photos in their raw form. i also usually make them more cool toned as opposed to warm toned.\n  ","409940":"\n  i'm not sure. it's just something i've always believed in for years.\n  ","409941":"\n  yeah, definitely. there are so many accounts out there dedicated to showing off \"ideal\" body types, and even thinspo accounts on tumblr and such, and it can make a person feel quite self conscious about their body and how other people may perceive them.\n  \n  especially considering most of those posts are photoshopped as well, they're unattainable body types but it isn't apparent from the outside.\n  ","409942":"\n  yes, i believe in the existence of a spirit.\n  ","409943":"\n  it's pushed by society for people to be thin because it's more desirable, and there's such a culture surrounding thinness that some people become self conscious because they don't fit into that specific body type.\n  \n  in terms of eating disorders, it's also something that may arise out of trauma or being self conscious about your body in some form or another from a young age. it becomes so prominent that it really rearranges your thought processes and behaviors.\n  ","409944":"\n  no, i just wanted to be thin.\n  ","409945":"\n  it's been ingrained in me from a young age, so it's natural for me to revert back to those old mindsets since it's all i've ever known.\n  ","409946":"\n  i experience intrusive thoughts on a near daily basis, mostly thoughts regarding hurting myself.\n  ","409947":"\n  i went a few days without food before my blood sugar rapidly dropped and i had no choice but to eat, even though i didn't want to. it was during a period of time in my life where i was restricting, purging, etc etc.\n  ","409948":"\n  this can be interpreted as an insensitive question, just fyi. especially toward people who have eating disorders.\n  \n  but, yeah. i have before.\n  ","409949":"\n  i suppose i give good relationship advice, considering people always ask me what to do in their particular situations.\n  ","409950":"\n  nope. it doesn't matter if they've offended yet or not, they're still a risk to children and that deserves zero respect from me.\n  ","409951":"\n  that's an unhealthy thought to have. when you get a girlfriend, you should accept her for who she is instead of comparing her to someone else.\n  ","409952":"\n  obviously not.\n  ","409953":"\n  i'm wearing tank tops in not one, but two of my profile pictures.\n  ","409954":"\n  my boyfriend's smile\/laughter, the sunset over the ocean, silence in the dead of night while snow is gently falling, animals showing their appreciation for their owners\/families, and nights spent having deep conversations with loved ones.\n  ","409955":"\n  hello !!\n  \n  my week was pretty good, honestly. i got a lot of work done throughout the week, started working out consistently, and got a lot of positive feedback at work regarding the projects i'm working on. today, i actually started training a new employee and will be providing her with feedback since i'm considered a \"senior\" editor at this point.\n  \n  i also had a huge campfire with my boyfriend the other night, which was a lot of fun. we don't get to see each other as often anymore, so every time we spend time together is a wonderful night.\n  ","409956":"\n  ???\n  \n  there's no correlation between someone being muslim and someone being a p*dophile like you just described. and no, p*dophiles don't deserve my respect because they're at risk of harming children. that's something that deserves zero respect in my book.\n  \n  get outta here with this nonsense. i won't respond to any more of these queries because all it does is attract p*dos themselves to my page.\n  ","409957":"\n  i don't talk about my sex life on the internet.\n  ","409958":"\n  just because they haven't offended and can control themselves now doesn't guarantee it in the future, though. either way, it's still horrific and they shouldn't be around children.\n  ","409959":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree with you. that's why i wasn't bothered when tumblr took away p*rn accounts because they were aware of all the p*dos on there and wanted to do something about it.\n  ","409960":"\n  they could burn in hell for all i care. \"non-offending\" is just a term they use to try to soften their feelings and make it \"acceptable,\" when in reality it's just as terrible as the ones who do offend. it simply means that they haven't offended yet because they weren't given the opportunity to do so.\n  ","409961":"\n  are you asking the difference between \"an expert in,\" \"an expert on,\" and \"an expert at\" ??\n  \n  personally, i don't think there's a difference. it's just a different way of phrasing things.\n  ","409962":"\n  no. they're disgusting creatures and i want nothing to do with them.\n  ","409963":"\n  read some instructional books on grammar & rhetoric (i recommend \"the elements of style\" and some books by ray bradbury). continue practicing even if you dislike what you're writing. there's nothing wrong with being critical with yourself, and *always* proofread & edit your own work.\n  ","409964":"\n  haha, this is cute. thank you very much.\n  ","409965":"\n  hello -- i'm doing well. i got home from work not too long ago, so i'm currently sitting down and relaxing before i go exercise for a little while.\n  ","409966":"\n  no, i'm in a relationship.\n  ","409967":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","409968":"\n  uh, i believe you mean bored ?? rofl.\n  \n  go outside and take a walk, go to the park and do some photography, watching a television show or movie, contact a friend, read a book, do some art, research a specific topic online and educate yourself, exercise, cook or bake, go shopping, etc etc.\n  ","409969":"\n  i have my mother and father's addictive personalities. my mother smoked cigarettes for over 20 years, and my father was a severe alcoholic for most of my life. i inherited those traits from them without meaning to, since i've been smoking cigarettes from the age of 18 and i've dealt with my own issues with alcohol (currently trying to drink less often as we speak).\n  ","409970":"\n  i suppose i'm an expert on the english language, particularly grammar, rhetoric, composition, editing, and analyzing literature. i majored in the subject when i was in college and earned a degree in communications\/professional writing. i also apply this knowledge every day at my current job.\n  ","409971":"\n  over the years, i've dropped more & more friendships. it's simply a part of getting older and realizing where your loyalties lie. you discover that some people are only friends with you out of curiosity, which is unhealthy. you should surround yourself with people who genuinely care about you, and who accept for you who you are while also being real enough with you to be comfortable telling you when you're doing something wrong.\n  ","409972":"\n  sushi, perhaps. my taste in different foods wax and wane, so sometimes i'll really enjoy sushi and then other times i won't want to eat it at all.\n  ","409973":"\n  i respect people unless they give me a reason not to respect them anymore. it has nothing to do with their religion.\n  ","409974":"\n  i think it's normal for the future to both excite and scare people, as it does for me. the future is absolutely uncertain, which is the terrifying part, but there's also a beauty in that uncertainty because you simply don't know if things will improve for you.\n  \n  there are a lot of things i'm looking forward to in the future, but i also admit that the future scares me at times.\n  ","409975":"\n  i hate commuting to and from work more than anything else. driving is one of my main sources of anxiety, and being in the car for two hours per day is just horrible for me. i absolutely hate the traffic involved & how everyone else on the road has no idea how to drive.\n  ","409976":"\n  no, the only language i know is english.\n  ","409977":"\n  there's one person i know who makes hardship into a competition, which is perhaps worse than someone trying to be the best at everything. every time someone in their life is struggling or complaining about something, this person always twists it to be about them and how they have it so much worse. it's extremely aggravating.\n  ","409978":"\n  i believe that greed is the ugliest emotion. that goes for both materialistic and emotion-based types of greed. some people are greedy in an emotional way in that they want everyone's attention for themselves regardless of how much it may hurt someone else, and they'll go to great lengths to get what they want.\n  ","409979":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n  ","409980":"\n  plant-based, like a vegetarian diet ?? if so, then i sorta already follow that kind of diet to a degree considering i don't eat meat often. when i do eat meat, it's usually just grilled chicken since that's among the healthiest ways to eat it. most of my diet consists of vegetables and other proteins, such as eggs and turkey breast. i also eat pasta (which is probably my downfall, LOL), but i've been trying to stick to whole grain pasta at least.\n  ","409981":"\n  i told you my writing isn't for sale. i do enough writing for my job as it is.\n  ","409982":"\n  i get paid to write, that's my occupation. lol. i wouldn't want to offer my services if i wasn't getting compensated for it.\n  ","409983":"\n  no, i'm a writer and editor.\n  ","409984":"\n  my writing isn't for sale, sorry.\n  ","409985":"\n  it's overcast and going to rain, so no.\n  ","409986":"\n  i'm not alone, lmao.\n  ","409987":"\n  i don't have any thoughts. names aren't something i feel strongly about.\n  ","409988":"\n  aw, this is sweet -- thank you !!\n  \n  honestly, i consider a difference between my intelligence and my personality. i'm book smart but it isn't really a reflection on my behavior and thought processes.\n  ","409989":"\n  i check my personal email every day, and while i'm at work i always have my email open so i get emails instantly.\n  ","409990":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","409991":"\n  my entire personality needs improvement. it's literally disordered. LOL.\n  ","409992":"\n  the weather was the same near me this morning & afternoon -- very windy, chilly, and overcast. i believe it's supposed to rain either tonight or tomorrow morning.\n  ","409993":"\n  discovery, growth, and determination.\n  ","409994":"\n  no, i don't believe i've ever watched one of those movies before.\n  ","409995":"\n  they were asleep.\n  ","409996":"\n  my boyfriend is my voice of reason.\n  ","409997":"\n  lmao, no. i don't post those kinds of photos online.\n  ","409998":"\n  the answer to your last question wasn't an invitation to ask more sexual questions. i don't generally talk about my sex life on the internet.\n  ","409999":"\n  lmao, yes. my boyfriend and i had no shame when we were in our party stage.\n  ","410000":"\n  i prefer beer, but i'm only going to try to have beer on special occasions because of the calories involved.\n  ","410001":"\n  no. life isn't guaranteed.\n  ","410002":"\n  last night was fun ;\n  ","410003":"\n  i'm never in a position where i have to deal with anyone who is \"fake.\" i don't surround myself with fake people, and if i ever have an inkling that someone around me isn't being genuine to themselves or acting out haphazardly for attention, then i purposely stay far away from them. i don't have time in my life for that kind of nonsense.\n  ","410004":"\n  it ultimately depends on what that favor is. i cannot promise anything.\n  ","410005":"\n  it's absolutely disgusting when he puts his dirty, wet socks on me when he's getting undressed after work. LOL.\n  ","410006":"\n  it isn't something i would willingly do if i had my own toothbrush, lol. but there were one or two moments in the past where i had to use his toothbrush because i forgot to bring mine.\n  ","410007":"\n  yeah -- i just said the term makes me uncomfortable. that's regardless of whether it's online or in real life, it means the same thing.\n  ","410008":"\n  that's your personal opinion. just because you're comfortable with the term doesn't mean that other people are comfortable with it. for future reference, do not call me ma'am. it's simply a term i'm uncomfortable with people using in reference to me.\n  ","410009":"\n  you make it seem like wanting attention is such a terrible thing, lol. sending this message out to multiple people is a bit contradictory to your message, though -- this message in itself is attention-seeking, so you're exhibiting the very trait that you're supposedly bashing.\n  ","410010":"\n  no. i don't click links that people send me on askfm, so it would fall on deaf ears.\n  ","410011":"\n  fyi = \"for your information.\"\n  ","410012":"\n  i didn't hear about that report. however, if that is indeed true, then i'm not surprised. humankind is exterminating all sorts of species just by existing, and we're not contributing to the growth or evolution of existing animals at all.\n  ","410013":"\n  i answered a question similar to this 10 minutes ago. in short, yes -- i had a good day.\n  \n  fyi, please don't call me \"ma'am.\" that makes me feel hella old and disgusted, lmao.\n  ","410014":"\n  i would choose brains over beauty. you can only remain attracted to someone for so long if all they have going for them is physical looks. what truly matters in any type of relationship is how well you meld together, your shared interests and passions, and the conversations you have -- which are all things that occur within the brain.\n  ","410015":"\n  yeah, dozens of times. i always just step away from the situation when i'm pushed to that degree of anger.\n  ","410016":"\n  this is a very false statement, my friend. veganism is, in fact, healthy as long as the person pursuing the lifestyle takes the proper steps to ensure their health and wellness, just like you should when you're not vegan or vegetarian.\n  \n  i've always believed in the concept of being vegan, which is why i try to always use cruelty-free products and vegan products whenever possible. it's just not something i've ever pursued when it comes to my diet yet.\n  ","410017":"\n  i'm not sure why trans is in there, considering being transgender isn't a sexual orientation. \"transexual\" is an extremely antiquated, outdated term for a trans person.\n  \n  to answer your question, however, i'm bisexual.\n  ","410018":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  things are going well. i had a great day at work actually, i felt super productive and tied up a lot of loose ends regarding the projects i'm working on. last night was also fun & relaxing ; i saw my boyfriend for the first time since last week, and we had a large campfire in his backyard while we talked & listened to music together.\n  ","410019":"\n  i don't know anyone named courtney who lives in australia, lol. the only courtney i know is my friend who recently deactivated.\n  ","410020":"\n  i'm pretty good at cooking breakfast food -- probably because it's super easy to make breakfast food, lol. you just have to scramble or fry some eggs, put bread in the toaster, fry some bacon if you desire, etc etc.\n  \n  however, my boyfriend makes the best breakfasts. i'm not sure what he does exactly, but his scrambled eggs always come out delicious.\n  ","410021":"\n  in my opinion, it depends ultimately on what that person did to screw up their first chance. sometimes people should be given the benefit of the doubt and\/or a second chance to redeem themselves, but there are some situations where it's impossible to allow that relationship to move forward.\n  ","410022":"\n  of course, i feel lonely on certain occasions. i believe everyone has the capability to feel loneliness regardless of how many friends or partners they have.\n  ","410023":"\n  i like more personalized questions these days, and i very much enjoy questions where people ask me how my day went, how i'm doing in my relationship, my mental health struggles, my work and education, etc etc.\n  \n  i'm open to answer nearly anything. the only questions i don't answer are ones that are gross & invasive, obvious attempts at trolling, and pointless questions that are immature or ridiculous.\n  ","410024":"\n  yes, it's possible to want to break up with someone you love. sometimes regardless of how much you love a person, you're simply not compatible and\/or they're not good for you (or vice versa). love is not the only thing you require in a relationship, and there are several components that tune into what makes a relationship work.\n  ","410025":"\n  i don't really know enough about the conspiracy to develop my own opinion on it. however, i do believe that the conspiracy is hella interesting !!\n  ","410026":"\n  perhaps. i've never tried a vegan lifestyle before.\n  ","410027":"\n  well it's been 10 years, so i'm fairly certain he's sticking around.\n  ","410028":"\n  all the time. he's extremely reassuring when it comes to this sort of thing.\n  ","410029":"\n  last friday. my coworker and i were scheduled to clean up after lunch, and he didn't join me to clean until 10 minutes later when i was already done. then another coworker decided to tell my supervisor, even though it wasn't her place to say anything, which pissed me off even more.\n  ","410030":"\n  yes, i very much so enjoy my job. it's stressful at times, but it's the best job i've ever had.\n  ","410031":"\n  no, not really. after working in retail and cleaning disgusting shelves and picking up after people, you kinda get used to it.\n  ","410032":"\n  abandonment. it's irrational because my boyfriend would never leave me, but i'm constantly terrified that he will.\n  ","410033":"\n  uh, it isn't the summer yet.\n  ","410034":"\n  since it's been upstairs, i've used it twice so far -- on sunday & again last night.\n  ","410035":"\n  LOL. i didn't even think of it that way.\n  ","410036":"\n  you can appreciate a friend's features without having intimate feelings towards them, lmao.\n  ","410037":"\n  no, the only language i know is english.\n  ","410038":"\n  i have a few acquaintances who are partially native american, yeah. i don't know anyone who's full native american, though.\n  ","410039":"\n  he'll ask me my opinion on things he's not sure if he likes or not, but i don't go out and choose his clothes for him, lmao. that's controlling behavior.\n  ","410040":"\n  i don't use yelp, so here's my seltzer haul from this afternoon ;\n  ","410041":"\n  yes, and i've actively sought revenge on people as well.\n  ","410042":"\n  of course !! askfm is basically my personal diary anyway, LOL.\n  ","410043":"\n  tomorrow, i'm working all day and then seeing my boyfriend after work.\n  ","410044":"\n  no, not in a serious manner at least.\n  ","410045":"\n  i've never gone actual camping before, unfortunately. however, my boyfriend and i sometimes set up the tent in the backyard and sleep outside, which is always fun.\n  ","410046":"\n  i do both, lol. i keep some of my thoughts to myself, but i also know when it's warranted to speak my mind about something. in the case where i keep things to myself, it's usually in situations where my opinion would only hurt the situation. sometimes it's simply better to remain quiet in some situations.\n  ","410047":"\n  it depends on the situation. i don't normally like saying no to things in my life, especially with respect to my job or in my friendships. but there are some things i'm either uncomfortable doing or i simply don't want to do them (this happens mostly around friends, though), so i feel the need to explain why i'm saying no because i don't want them to think i have something against them personally.\n  ","410048":"\n  yes, i know a few people like that. they give off the impression that they don't care about anything and can give any opinion they want regardless of how much it can hurt people, but then when they get called out on their behavior, they retreat and don't even confront the issue and\/or pretend it didn't happen.\n  ","410049":"\n  lately, i've been catching myself saying \"are you fuckin' kidding me?\" under my breath a lot, LOL.\n  ","410050":"\n  i'm sure when i finish, i'll be posting about it on here and\/or on facebook, LOL.\n  ","410051":"\n  can't wait !! depending on how i feel later and how tired i am, i want to watch some more. i ended up not getting much sleep last night because i was watching it until 1:30am, lmao.\n  ","410052":"\n  omg, i literally started watching it last night !! i'm up to the third episode, i believe.\n  \n  i don't have a roundabout opinion because i didn't finish watching what's available already, but so far i find the show to be very compelling. i'm around the part where gypsy rose is beginning to really question her mother's attempts to make her seem sicker than she actually is, and she's beginning to rebel. i'm so excited to see how it turns out later on, considering we already know what happens to the mother through flash-forward scenes.\n  ","410053":"\n  i'm doing well -- i got out of work two hours ago, and then i stopped at target on the way home to pick up some seltzer and coffee. i got home about 30 minutes ago, so i've been sitting down and relaxing before i go work out.\n  ","410054":"\n  i don't partake in it, so it isn't something i think about.\n  ","410055":"\n  no, nothing really offends me these days -- not unless someone is personally targeting me and saying something terrible to me on purpose in an effort to get under my skin. even so, my offense isn't as much anger as it is concern.\n  ","410056":"\n  yes, i know what ramadan is.\n  ","410057":"\n  panic, mainly.\n  ","410058":"\n  there are obviously people i dislike, but i don't have beef with anyone at the moment.\n  ","410059":"\n  i used to watch them a lot when i was younger, but i can't handle them these days. they make my anxiety skyrocket, lol.\n  ","410060":"\n  no, i've never owned an iphone.\n  ","410061":"\n  it's currently 1:18am, and i'm going to bed. i watched nearly three episodes of the act before i realized how late it was.\n  ","410062":"\n  if anyone has any questions, they would be greatly appreciated ~~\n  ","410063":"\n  unless our families decide they miraculously want to pay for our wedding, it's naturally coming out of our own pockets. like i said, it isn't a priority to us.\n  ","410064":"\n  i don't have children, nor do i believe i want children in the future, so this question is irrelevant to me.\n  ","410065":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n  ","410066":"\n  yes, i am wholeheartedly against physical discipline as a form of punishment.\n  ","410067":"\n  it isn't as easy as just believing, lmao. unfortunately, existing in today's society costs a plethora of money, and weddings to accomodate both of our families are expensive.\n  ","410068":"\n  yes, we both work full time.\n  ","410069":"\n  paying for bills, getting a new vehicle (in his case), and moving in together, among other things. we have various financial obligations before we can even think about paying for a wedding.\n  ","410070":"\n  it isn't a concern of ours at the moment. there's a lot of things for us to do before we can consider getting married.\n  ","410071":"\n  yeah, i have friends who are men.\n  ","410072":"\n  i'm fairly certain, lmao. we have a good relationship and there's no reason for us not to get married in the future, unless he believes otherwise.\n  ","410073":"\n  obviously. just because you're friends with someone of a different sex doesn't mean that you have to be more than friends with them.\n  ","410074":"\n  most likely, we've been together for 10 years.\n  ","410075":"\n  no, i'm in a relationship.\n  ","410076":"\n  i'm doing well. i'm just watching hulu before i go to bed.\n  ","410077":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","410078":"\n  it's been a while since i read a book, unfortunately. the last one i read was \"i am not a serial killer\" by dan wells.\n  ","410079":"\n  yes, absolutely. shelter is a basic need.\n  ","410080":"\n  no, the only things i send myself are little \u2727 or -- signs, in the off chance i want to talk about something that no one has asked me about.\n  ","410081":"\n  lmao. no, i'm not interested in making new friends.\n  ","410082":"\n  no. i don't know you, so i won't accept your request.\n  ","410083":"\n  my username is\n  \n   @poetalunam\n  \n  , same as on here, but my account is private & i only accept people i know.\n  ","410084":"\n  i don't have a whatsapp account.\n  ","410085":"\n  scroll through social media, watch a documentary on television, play video games, and sometimes i'll read or write creatively.\n  ","410086":"\n  LOL, hell no. i do the bare minimum when i run my errands -- unwashed jeans, sneakers, and a hoodie with my hair up in a ponytail. i'm not looking to impress or talk to anyone when i'm out shopping or running my errands.\n  ","410087":"\n  right now, it's fairly chaotic. i really need to tidy things up, but i've been exhausted lately. perhaps i'll try to motivate myself to pick some things up tonight and finish up tomorrow night.\n  \n  it isn't *terrible* but it's to the point where it makes me feel claustrophobic because not everything is in its rightful place.\n  ","410088":"\n  once every few months, if even that often. i ideally should be shaving my head every few weeks or so, but it isn't a priority to me. i'm planning on making another appointment for the middle of june so i can refresh the blue and get a fresh shave.\n  ","410089":"\n  going out drinking at night with my friends. i don't do it as often as i used to, but i still regard it as a mistake because i always feel terrible in the morning. however, i keep repeating those behaviors time & time again.\n  ","410090":"\n  i prefer chips over popcorn. lately i've been eating veggie chips if i need a snack between meals.\n  ","410091":"\n  i already have a plot & title for a book that i'm planning on writing, and i don't feel comfortable revealing those details.\n  ","410092":"\n  there isn't a song that makes me happy, so none. my moods aren't so much influenced by music in that way, music simply amplifies whatever i'm currently feeling.\n  ","410093":"\n  i thought i lost my debit card on saturday night, but it turns out that i placed it in the wrong pocket of my wallet.\n  ","410094":"\n  nightshade and nirnroot.\n  ","410095":"\n  no, i've never been in a position where i had to attend physiotherapy\/physical therapy. i've never broken a bone, and i never went to the doctor for the times i believe i sprained a muscle.\n  ","410096":"\n  i've never not tipped a server, and i don't have any intentions of not tipping a server either. even if i have terrible service, i'll leave at least something because i understand that servers rely primarily on their tips in order to pay their bills.\n  \n  i don't believe tipping should be mandatory, but i still strongly believe that if you don't have enough money to tip someone at least 15% for regular service, then you shouldn't be going out to eat at all.\n  ","410097":"\n  i think it varies case-by-case. it would be virtually impossible to monitor every single case of cyber bullying, but there are obviously some cases that are worse than others, which can lead to detrimental effects on someone's mental health.\n  \n  in the case where someone is very negatively affected by cyber bullying to the point where it leads to a drastic change in mood, personality, and behavior, including SH or s*uicidal action, then legal consequences should take place.\n  ","410098":"\n  i support welfare in general. there's nothing wrong with needing extra help when it comes to the necessities of living, particularly in terms of food, shelter, and making sure you and your children are safe.\n  \n  a lot of people who criticize welfare, such as food stamps, claim that there are so many people who ab*se the system, when that isn't true whatsoever. there are stringent rules set in place for someone to receive government assistance and not everyone is qualified for them. i also think it's ridiculous how people who criticize those on welfare are essentially saying they don't believe those people deserve the basic right to exist comfortably.\n  ","410099":"\n  men are ostracized for having what are seen as \"women-oriented\" jobs because of the societal expectations that are in place regarding what a man's job is vs. what a woman's job is. it's seen as \"less\" manly for a man to be doing a job that is typically occupied by women, especially in the case of caregiving, nursing, etc etc.\n  \n  ideally, there should be less stigma associated with men doing what are stereotypically seen as \"womenly\" things, because the narrative behind those things is utterly false and it doesn't make someone less of a man for doing them.\n  ","410100":"\n  the one who cheated is at fault. cheating isn't acceptable if you're unhappy with your sex life, and there's an expectation of open communication and trust in relationships. ideally, the person who's unhappy with their intimate life should talk to their partner about these feelings so that they can come to a mutual agreement regarding what they should do to either spice up their life or make other arrangements.\n  ","410101":"\n  i believe it's your responsibility as a parent to clean up after your child, regardless of whether or not you're in a public facility and it's the server's \"job\" to clean the table. people who don't take responsibility for their own, and by association their children's, messes shouldn't go to public places. it's incredibly entitled to leave that mess for someone else to clean.\n  ","410102":"\n  no, i don't have any injuries. my back is aching, but that's not unusual for me.\n  ","410103":"\n  i believe there's such a stereotype of women being the sole caregivers to children that it erases the responsibility of men being fathers to their children as well. women are typically viewed in society as being the main caregiver to children, even when they're in a relationship with or married to the father, because of their maternal instincts -- as well as the age-old expectation of women to be mothers instead of any other archetypes.\n  \n  in reality -- and idealistically -- fathers should be just as responsible as mothers for taking care of children. women shouldn't be expected to take \"extra\" care of their children in the event of them being gone for a period of time just so that it alleviates responsibility on the father. a father is just as much of a parent as a mother, and their responsibilities toward their children should be equal.\n  ","410104":"\n  yes, they should lose custody of their child(ren). if someone is convicted of domestic ab*se, then they have no business being around their own children because they're just as much of a danger to those children as they are to their spouse.\n  ","410105":"\n  any form of drama involving \"he said, she said\" bullsh*t. some people simply get so heated over a rumor they heard about themselves, when in reality it doesn't really matter. those who know you and care about you won't believe the lies, and those who feed into the drama aren't people you want around in your life to begin with.\n  ","410106":"\n  not generally, no. the only opinions i care about are those of my boyfriend and best friend.\n  ","410107":"\n  the first cup of coffee & cigarette in the morning, having long conversations with my boyfriend or close friends, writing creatively, receiving positive reinforcement, photography, doing art, playing video games, sunbathing outside with a book, and having a drink with friends.\n  ","410108":"\n  i don't remember tbh, and my phone won't tell me because my google account is linked to my google searches that i use at work on my desktop computer, so those searches are all work-related things.\n  ","410109":"\n  there's nothing planned that i'm looking forward to, so nothing at the moment. perhaps my boyfriend and i will plan a vacation soon.\n  ","410110":"\n  i prefer doritos, specifically cool ranch.\n  ","410111":"\n  oh, most definitely. lmao. i've done too much horrible sh*t in my life for me not to go to hell.\n  ","410112":"\n  i know how to use applications like microsoft office and some adobe products, but that's pretty much it.\n  ","410113":"\n

","410118":"\n  upstate new york. there was a dude ranch\/resort i used to frequent with my boyfriend and a few of our friends, and those vacations were always extremely fun.\n  ","410119":"\n  my boyfriend is a fairly messy person, and that's really the only thing that bothers me about him. i like keeping things tidy & organized, but he's usually so busy that he doesn't have as much time to clean as he wants. on the flip side, however, he is very good at cleaning when he has the time to do so.\n  ","410120":"\n  i wouldn't be in this field if i didn't enjoy it, lol. it's what i graduated from college in and pursued post-graduation.\n  ","410121":"\n  sitting in the same position for long periods of time isn't healthy at all, and its caused me to gain weight because i'm simply not burning energy throughout the day.\n  ","410122":"\n  i'm a writer\/editor for a publishing company.\n  ","410123":"\n  if i had a physically demanding job, then i wouldn't need to exercise. however, i've worked in offices for the past four years and the sedentary lifestyle is becoming detrimental to my health.\n  ","410124":"\n  i'm doing well !! i'm incredibly proud of myself for making the push to exercise today, and i'm planning on walking at least one mile every day until further notice. now that i have a treadmill in the adjacent room upstairs, i really have no excuse to not exercise every day.\n  ","410125":"\n  the same it's always been -- mostly lean proteins and vegetables, some carbs here & there, and the occasional splurge on junk food (although i've been transitioning to veggie chips instead of regular potato chips).\n  \n  the weekends are normally more carb-oriented because it's when i like to treat myself, i.e. i had an egg sandwich this morning for breakfast.\n

The worst case is that I have a hard time finishing without seeing or thinking about pxrn. I hope that anon gets what they were looking for\n  \n  --\n  \n  thank you for explaining your experience !! i can relate with this a lot because i was definitely hyper-s*xual when i was a teenager, and i can probably attribute that to the p*rn i watched as well. i started having s*xual experiences from the time i was 12 years old, which is way too early in my opinion, and p*rn also gave me an unrealistic expectation of what sex would be like.\n  \n  i'm grateful in that my experiences weren't worse, but it definitely had the potential to be much worse than it was. i could have fallen into sex trafficking or started out in the industry from a very young age, and thankfully that didn't happen. however, it happens to a plethora of people when they're young.\n  ","410141":"\n  yes, i drink

healthy to have an inflated sense of self and think that you deserve x just for existing. that isn't how the world works.\n  ","410144":"\n  well i can't speak on behalf of that anon, but discovering p*rn at an early age can hinder development because of the increased emphasis placed on sex. it can make people value sex greater than it should be valued, and it can also lead to p*rn or sex addiction.\n  \n  thankfully that didn't happen to me, but i still regret discovering p*rn at a really young age. it simply isn't something appropriate for a child to see, especially when they're as young as 8 or 11 years old.\n  ","410145":"\n  considering it's raining heavily and a bit chilly where i live at the moment, it probably isn't the best time to go to the beach.\n  ","410146":"\n  yeah, i totally understand this. i started watching p*rn when i was around 11 years old too, and because i was intelligent for my age, i already knew how to delete my cookies and browsing history so that even if my parents checked the computer, nothing would appear on there. it also didn't help that there was a separate computer for me in the dining room, while my father used his own personal computer in his bedroom.\n  \n  sometimes i wish my parents were more aware when it came to things like the internet, because i was definitely too young to see some of the things i saw, but at the same time, i also found a community of people who genuinely helped me with my mental health during a crucial time of my life, and i don't know if i would be alive today had i not met them when i did.\n  ","410147":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","410148":"\n  i believe i was around 11 or 12 years old when i first started using the internet unsupervised. honestly, i believe i was too young to use the internet completely because i was open to all of the horrible wonderment of the internet from a very early age, and it could have had devastating effects on me.\n  \n  i don't really feel comfortable with the idea of children using the internet for that reason -- there's simply so much danger out there, and it's usually disguised as something fun or meaningless. it's easy to fall into the traps of people who have nefarious reasoning and intentions. and it isn't that i wouldn't trust my future child, but i wouldn't trust the situation at all. children are naturally naive, so i would be terrified that they would fall into a situation that they cannot get out of.\n  ","410149":"\n  it's extremely difficult for me to let go of people if i was previously attached to them. my emotions when it comes to other people range from not caring about them whatsoever to caring so deeply & intimately about them that i simply don't know what i would do without them.\n  \n  there was one person in particular whose presence was difficult to let go, but it was for the best because they were a terrible person and i had to do what was right for myself.\n  ","410150":"\n  LOL. that definitely was not who i was thinking about when i typed that answer, but if the shoe fits.\n  ","410151":"\n  i went to the very first \"let's play live\" event hosted by achievement hunter -- they set up their gaming consoles and had huge screens showing them playing video games and doing other comedic routines at radio city music hall in new york city a few years ago.\n  \n  it was one of the most fun nights i've ever had, even though the line to get inside was wrapped around the building and i was standing in the pouring rain for an hour. i ran into griffon ramsey and barbara dunkelman while waiting on line for a drink, so i took a photo with both of them and thanked them for just being themselves. the crowd response was enormous, and it was one of those instances where you felt like you were part of something greater than yourself.\n  ","410152":"\n  someone who's ab*sive (both physically & mentally), toxic, manipulative, etc etc. someone who thinks solely of themselves and tries to warp situations into making themselves out to be the victim when they were actually the offender. someone who does typically bad things with no respect for those around them and with no remorse for their actions.\n  ","410153":"\n  i wish i didn't give up on exercising last year when i was working out -- i ultimately lost my motivation for a variety of reasons (my gym partner moved, my depression came back, i got heavily into drinking, etc etc). if i had stuck with my exercise regimen, then i definitely wouldn't look like how i am today & i would be happier with myself.\n  \n  regardless, it's useless to focus on the past like that. the only thing we can do is continue moving forward and make more goals for ourselves.\n  ","410154":"\n  it ultimately depends on the existing relationship between the child and their parents, i believe. if they value their relationship with their parents and are close to them, then they may feel more comfortable introducing their partner earlier in the relationship rather than later (for example).\n  \n  there's really no best or worst time, in my opinion. everyone has different standards and values when it comes to dating, so it's whatever is most comfortable to the person.\n  ","410155":"\n  i know of the show \"once upon a time,\" but i thought it was a fantasy television series for adults, lol.\n  \n

them that i missed my boyfriend, lmao.\n  ","410170":"\n  i believe i would, yes. however, it would have to be under a circumstance where it was obviously warranted or expected of me, such as in the case of a tragedy and i wanted to show solidarity. to randomly cover your head without reason may be interpreted as making a mockery out of the religion, so the timing is important.\n  ","410171":"\n

all times to establish a foundation of trust.\n  ","410188":"\n  i'm pretty sure my mother is pro-life, because we had a conversation once and she said something like, \"i just don't understand how anyone could k*ll a baby like that\" (referring to abortion). so i tried explaining it to her that when abortions happen, the fetus isn't viable and she wasn't understanding.\n  \n  my father and i, on the other hand, agree with most things. he's left-leaning like i am.\n  ","410189":"\n  yes, i'm good at multi-tasking. it's something i've always had to do from when i was young, ranging from high school & college courses to now being in the workforce.\n  ","410190":"\n  no, not really. a discussion implies a civil, casual conversation. while a debate implies something that's much more heated &

comfortable with the idea, i see nothing wrong with it.\n  ","410209":"\n  uh, that isn't how surrogacy works. when a person takes on the responsibility of being a surrogate, they become artificially inseminated through in-vitro fertilization. there's no physical contact involved.\n  ","410210":"\n  i don't get catcalled in real life, but occasionally people will message me on social media &

trans people, disabled people, lgbt+ members, etc etc.\n  ","410221":"\n  haha, no. if i'm having espresso, then i usually order an americano or a double-shot over ice.\n  ","410222":"\n  i used to shy away from them & try to put the conversation off for as long as possible. however, in recent years i've developed a desire to have more hard conversations with people because it keeps both people humble, and i try to also face them head-on. when spoken to the right person, the hard conversation can strengthen your relationship.\n  ","410223":"\n  i don't have many talents, and i don't believe any of them are hidden. my main talents are writing, editing, time management, and ingesting large amounts of coffee within a short period of time.\n  ","410224":"\n  having a relationship with someone is different from just having sex with someone, in my personal opinion. you can have no-strings-attached sex with a person simply to gain sexual satisfaction without having an intimate connection with them. if he admitted that he wasn't satisfied with our relationship on a sexual level, then i believe i would be fine with him pursuing sexual relations elsewhere, and he's perfectly capable of having sex without developing feelings for someone else.\n  \n  it's different in an open relationship because you *are* developing feelings for another person and you're actively dating them, just as you're dating your first partner. i wouldn't be able to handle the thought of him committing his emotions to another person while also maintaining our own relationship because our emotional relationship is sacred to me, and i would be afraid of that other person \"winning\" him over because i'm a general mess of a human being.\n  ","410225":"\n  this may come as a surprise to you all, but i've actually never seen a single star wars movie. :\/\/\n  ","410226":"\n  no, but i am. LOL. i don't know if i would be able to handle the thought of him being with someone else, and i definitely wouldn't want to date someone besides him.\n  ","410227":"\n  probably not. my boyfriend and i have discussed it in the past, and we both agreed that it wouldn't be for us.\n  ","410228":"\n  i would most rather live a 60-year long life that's filled with excitement & adventure. to live for as long as 120 years with no exciting experiences to show for it seems rather tortuous and boring.\n  ","410229":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, because while i believe that people who are typically \"bad\" people don't have any productive value to add to society, there are usually at least *some* people who do find value in their existence, even if the majority of society doesn't agree with their actions or behaviors.\n  ","410230":"\n  perhaps english literature, haha. i really enjoyed my english literature courses when i took them in high school because they were interesting and diverse.\n  ","410231":"\n  i honestly don't remember the majority of my childhood, so unfortunately i don't have an exact answer to this question. :\/\/ i don't know what i ate frequently, let alone remember which food reminds me of my childhood.\n  ","410232":"\n  aw, this is reassuring. thank you very much !!\n  \n  as much as the law firm was a terrible job, i genuinely enjoyed \"advocating\" for the rights of disabled people, whether they were struggling with physical or mental disabilities, and sometimes both. we sought to win them their well-deserved disability benefits, which we often did, but unfortunately i couldn't continue with that job because it was so detrimental to my own mental health.\n  ","410233":"\n  most people don't recognize their privilege, unfortunately. a lot of people are ignorant to what privilege is and whether or not they have it, and they often speak up over disabled people and discount their struggles. i witnessed it a lot when i was working at the law firm because we specialized in disability law. our clients were even discriminated against by their own doctors.\n  ","410234":"\n  yes, you're correct. i don't have any physical disabilities, so i never experienced ableism as it relates to physical conditions. however, i do have mental illness where i've experienced ableism based on my mental conditions, even though they're not legally disabling.\n  ","410235":"\n  i didn't imply that, because i said that there are probably people who aren't white who haven't experienced racism (a few answers above). but you're correct -- i obviously wouldn't know what it's like to experience racism because i never have & i never will.\n  ","410236":"\n  i recognize my privilege, as i stated in an earlier answer. just because i benefit from white privilege doesn't mean i don't acknowledge that other people don't have the same privilege.\n  ","410237":"\n  a dictionary definition doesn't take into account the sociological effects of privilege or racism, it's honestly just a rudimentary definition that doesn't necessarily evolve with the times.\n  \n  freedom shouldn't be a special right, but it nevertheless is, and racism is unfortunately \"normal\" and commonplace. it's harmful to not acknowledge that racism is widespread in today's society.\n  ","410238":"\n  i don't know if they would experience *white* privilege, considering they're not white, but it's definitely a privilege to have not experienced racism in your life.\n  \n  unfortunately in today's society, it *is* a privilege. just because it's a basic human right in ideal terms doesn't mean that people recognize it as such. a lot of people, mostly people who are actually white, think of other races as inferior and don't believe they deserve the same rights.\n  ","410239":"\n  if they don't directly experience racism, because i'm sure there are some people who don't, then they obviously have the potential to experience racism because they're not white.\n  ","410240":"\n  yes, it's called white privilege. white people don't experience racism, but people of other races do. white people have always been in positions of power & have been the oppressors in society, not the other way around.\n  \n  naturally, white people can be discriminated against but there's a difference between racism and discrimination.\n  ","410241":"\n  people value my opinion higher than those who aren't white or cis, and i don't suffer from racism as a result of my white privilege. i do have people discriminate against me for being non-binary and i face a lot of transphobia, but it's mainly online because i don't advertise my gender in real life.\n  ","410242":"\n  i think this varies from person to person, because it all depends on the individual's value of family and the severity of the dysfunction within the family.\n  \n  personally speaking, i would have preferred to have no family over having a dysfunctional family. my family has been dysfunctional for as long as i can remember & it's been detrimental to my mental health. i don't place much value in my own family at all, so it would have been better for me if i didn't have a family at all.\n  ","410243":"\n  i benefit from privilege because i'm a white cis-passing person, but i would prefer having opportunities over privilege because i don't want to be defined by my privilege. i try to use my privilege to speak up for other groups and make things right, because i feel it's my duty to do so. however, i would prefer to have opportunities based on my work ethic and talents.\n  ","410244":"\n  uh, probably certain drugs. LOL. i always said i wouldn't smoke marijuana or do cocaine, but nevertheless, i did both when i was a young adult.\n  ","410245":"\n  following your own dreams is *much* more important than following the dreams your parents want for you. you're your own individual first & foremost, and even if your parents push for you to go down a certain career path, you have to remember that you need to do what's best for yourself because you're ultimately in control of your own life -- not your parents.\n  ","410246":"\n  the last meal i made for myself was veggie burgers and french fries. however, the last meal i ate was the vegetable soup i had for dinner last night.\n  ","410247":"\n  i wouldn't say that i've fallen in love with someone, but i was very infatuated with someone when i was a teenager who didn't know who i was.\n  ","410248":"\n  i don't enjoy cooking because i'm simply not good at it, rofl. i don't see it as a chore, though, because it's necessary (although most chores are necessary, but eating is obviously very important). on the flip side, i do enjoy cleaning and doing laundry because it makes me feel better when they're done.\n  ","410249":"\n  i generally don't vote in local politics, and this past year was the first time i actually voted for my region. although i don't generally remain abreast of local happenings, i did do some research last fall and voted accordingly.\n  ","410250":"\n  i like being in the center of attention when it comes to my close friends and boyfriend, but when it comes to other people & strangers, i prefer being in the background because the spotlight makes me uncomfortable.\n  ","410251":"\n  i think the fast pace that the news spreads across social media is a blessing, tbh. people are able to read the news and become informed on current events moreso now than ever before, and it also spreads to different countries so that now people are more aware than in past years. it's always good to be informed.\n  ","410252":"\n  just because i don't think i'm attractive doesn't mean that he doesn't either, rofl. he's very much attracted to me, otherwise we wouldn't be together.\n  ","410253":"\n  no, i'm not a superstitious person by any means.\n  ","410254":"\n  i'm not in situations where people have the opportunity to call me attractive or any related synonym, lol. it simply doesn't happen during my life. occasionally my friends will call me \"cute\" if i send them a selfie on snapchat, but i don't agree with them.\n  ","410255":"\n  none of the above. i don't find myself to be attractive at all.\n  ","410256":"\n  no, i quite enjoy it actually !! the purpose of askfm is to ask and answer questions, so i enjoy it when people ask me things and especially when they follow up on questions with additional inquiries into my original answer. :'))\n  ","410257":"\n  it depends entirely on what sort of chance they're looking for and their behavior towards me in general. if someone wants to become friends, then i'm normally resistant to the idea because i'm under the belief that friendship cannot be forced upon others and should happen naturally. that's why it always puzzles me when people on askfm say \"can we be friends?\" because friendship just doesn't work that way.\n  ","410258":"\n  no, it doesn't provoke any emotional response within me. it's just a name.\n  ","410259":"\n  no, i'm neither cute nor am i a girl. the term simply doesn't apply to me.\n  ","410260":"\n  yes, it's happened on a few occasions in the past. thankfully it was never anything dire, it was normally just a vague response to a statement or question that was sent to the wrong person because i clicked on someone else's name in my messages by mistake.\n  ","410261":"\n  i didn't even know that was the name of china's military forces until just now, so evidently i don't have an opinion.\n  ","410262":"\n  no, i'm clearly a full grown adult. lmao.\n  ","410263":"\n  criminals trying to break into homes, breaking into cars, etc etc. the \"ring\" doorbell has a camera on it, so it records any activity picked up within the vicinity of the device. that includes people walking up to the front door and can also include people dwelling near the cars in the driveway or in front of the house.\n  ","410264":"\n  i haven't watched youtube in a while, but i enjoy watching videos from gaming channels such as ;\n  \n  -- markiplier\n  \n  -- chilledchaos\n  \n  -- jacksepticeye\n  \n  -- achievement hunter\/rooster teeth\n  \n  -- seananners (when he used to be active)\n  \n  i also enjoy those 24\/7 live streams of lo-fi hip hop music, because they're very relaxing to me and they help me write.\n  ","410265":"\n  LOL. yeah, it would definitely be along the lines of movies such as hostel, oldboy, audition, etc etc.\n  ","410266":"\n  you can say \"people with intellectual disabilities.\"\n  ","410267":"\n  things that are too grotesque to explain on askfm.\n  ","410268":"\n  i used to have terrible, reoccurring nightmares when i was younger. they stopped after i reached adulthood, thankfully, but it was always the same set of 2-3 nightmares that would consistently plague me and frighten me every night. it was horrifying.\n  ","410269":"\n  LOL. i've never seen it myself because i don't have the app on my phone, but i'm actually grateful for it because it has taught my parents to be more vigilant and less trusting of our neighbors.\n  \n  i've always known that my town isn't the safest town, so i would always lock doors the second i came into the house, etc etc. meanwhile, my parents have no problem keeping the front door wide open or unlocked for hours & it has always bothered me. after they downloaded the app and saw all of the criminal activities going on, they started locking the doors right away. whew.\n  ","410270":"\n  neither -- i'm more of a realist than anything else. i don't view things in terms of all-good or all-bad, and i like the approach circumstances from various perspectives and mindsets to try to predict the most probable cause or reaction.\n  \n  sometimes when i get into a depressive mindset, i do become very pessimistic. but the feeling is only fleeting, and once i'm feeling back to \"normal,\" then i don't have those pessimistic thoughts anymore.\n  ","410271":"\n  i really have to be in the mood for the beach in order to go, especially now that i've gained weight and don't feel comfortable in a swimsuit. even when i go to to the beach, i don't go into the water very often unless i get super hot. most of the time, i prefer laying on the towel in the sand and getting a suntan.\n  ","410272":"\n  i distinctly remember one person my parents used to bring to the house who made me feel uncomfortable, but i don't really remember *why* he made me feel uncomfortable. he just had a creepy aura about him. eventually my parents stopped being friends with him and his girlfriend, i also don't know why, but they stopped coming over the house when i was still very young.\n  ","410273":"\n  no, that's not possible in my house. my bedroom window is two stories high and there's nothing to break the fall.\n  ","410274":"\n  no, but my parents do. they have that smart doorbell (i think it's called \"ring\"), and there's a community forum on the app where neighbors can post their videos of criminal happenings in the town.\n  ","410275":"\n  i honestly can't remember, but it's a decent sized screen. i'm definitely not about to take out my measuring tape and measure it, rofl. i got my TV a few years ago when my old TV's backlight died out, and it wasn't worth the price to try to fix it. so i ended up just buying a smart TV.\n  ","410276":"\n  i can name perhaps three of my own friends whom i consider \"true\" friends. i also consider my boyfriend's best friend to be a true friend, but he's not so much my friend as he is my boyfriend's friend, if that makes any sense.\n  ","410277":"\n  i used formspring frequently !! i think that's how i found out about askfm, actually. i joined askfm in 2011\/2012 (i think) because formspring was dying off.\n  ","410278":"\n  this is from three days ago, my dude. why are you still bothered by this ?? lmao.\n  \n  regardless,\n  \n   @babycadiexo\n  \n  clarified her age when she dated her ex and it wasn't a big age gap. the anon was clearly lying just to try to prove their \"point.\" regardless of who it is, if someone is dating someone much older than them and they're a teenager, then i'm going to express concern.\n  ","410279":"\n  i know some people in florida who endured the hurricane, but they didn't sustain any damage from the storm, thankfully.\n  ","410280":"\n  yes, i have. it's too bitter for my taste.\n  ","410281":"\n  no, she wants to spend more time focusing on streaming and askfm was distracting her from that.\n  ","410282":"\n  oh god, lmao. i forgot about the whole \"safe space\" thing.\n  ","410283":"\n  i don't know anything about local politics, so i really don't know.\n  ","410284":"\n  i'm probably more left-leaning than anything else. it's been a while since i've attempted to define my beliefs, though.\n  ","410285":"\n  hm, that's interesting. i could think of a handful of things you can dedicate your life to that's better than bashing people who did nothing to you.\n  ","410286":"\n  no, i never heard of him before.\n  ","410287":"\n  occasionally, yeah. i don't usually have a setting where i have the opportunity to sit down and listen to a podcast, though.\n  ","410288":"\n  vile.\n  ","410289":"\n  yes, i have malt drinks on occasion (assuming you're talking about the alcoholic kind). my first ever alcoholic drink was a malt beverage, lol.\n  ","410290":"\n  i don't believe i ever had an official \"talk\" with my parents about sex. if i did, i don't remember it at all. i knew about sex since before the age of 10, so i can only assume it was from my friends.\n  ","410291":"\n  i used to have friends like that, but i haven't done anything wild or ridiculous since my early 20s. i've since disbanded from those friends because we all ended up being toxic for each other.\n  ","410292":"\n  i generally didn't get in trouble because i was a good student. however, there was one incident where i was pulled into the principal's office when i was in high school and they accused me of writing a death threat on a desk. i just remember sitting in a small room that only had a table and two chairs, and the police officer was asking me various, intimidating questions and basically assumed that *i* was the one who wrote the threat, even though other people also sat at that desk at other times during the day.\n  \n  they eventually let me go, but my anxiety skyrocketed that day and i nearly had a panic attack in the office.\n  ","410293":"\n  when i'm around my boyfriend, i always feel safe. he's a significant source of comfort to me, and every time i see him, i'm overcome with a sensation of safety and being \"home.\"\n  \n  when i'm not around my boyfriend, sometimes i do feel rather unsafe. i can certainly defend myself, but i'm always terribly paranoid that someone is following me, watching me, keeping tabs on me, etc etc. i also get into mindsets where my impulsivity takes over and i have the urge to do dangerous things, so that plays a part in it as well.\n  ","410294":"\n  as far as i'm aware, i don't move at all when i sleep. the only thing i do is that i grind my teeth while i'm sleeping. :\/\/ i really need to get a mouth-guard.\n  \n  i don't cuddle with anything, unless my boyfriend is in bed with me, lol. when i'm sleeping alone, however, i sprawl out and wrap myself into a blanket burrito.\n  ","410295":"\n  i've never had it before. however, i dislike custard so i probably wouldn't like it at all.\n  ","410296":"\n  when i was much younger, yes. i wanted nothing to do with relationships during most of my teenage years so i never really noticed when\/if someone was flirting with me.\n  ","410297":"\n  i don't own any of those kinds of shoes. right now, my favorite pair of shoes are these sleek, black ankle boots that i've been wearing almost every day.\n  ","410298":"\n  if you need psychiatric advice, then you may be better off consulting someone who's a mental health professional. i can relate my experiences and feelings to others, but i'm not a doctor.\n  ","410299":"\n  no, i don't have any drug allergies. i just have regular seasonal allergies, i.e. pollen and whatnot.\n  ","410300":"\n  i prefer pasta, curly fries (depending on how they're made), and soda.\n  ","410301":"\n  i have five profile pictures you can look at to see what i look like. i don't have any new ones.\n  ","410302":"\n  yeah, i drink energy drinks on occasion !! i just tried the new red bull today, actually, and it was really good. it's called \"beach breeze\" & it tastes like tropical fruit and coconut.\n  ","410303":"\n  courtney deactivated her account last week.\n  ","410304":"\n  no, rofl. it isn't that deep. it's just something that i don't really enjoy.\n  ","410305":"\n  neither, i'm

teeth, if they count.\n  ","410309":"\n  i'm pretty sure most people want to be wealthy, lol.\n  ","410310":"\n  no, not really. if i go to the beach, for example, i'm much more content with laying out on the towel in the sand than going in the ocean.\n  ","410311":"\n  i don't have a favorite car because i don't care about cars. as long as it runs well and has good miles to the gallon, it's fine by me.\n  ","410312":"\n  i went to a water park once or twice when i was a teenager.\n  ","410313":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 27 years old.\n  ","410314":"\n  no, i don't add people on xbox live unless they're already an existing friend. regardless, i also don't generally play live games -- and the ones i do, i already have a small group of friends who i play with.\n  ","410315":"\n  i've been smoking cigarettes since i was 18 years old.\n  ","410316":"\n  i play on an xbox one.\n  ","410317":"\n  well yeah, if i didn't like smoking then i simply wouldn't smoke.\n  ","410318":"\n  bored af -- anyone have any questions ?? ?\n  ","410319":"\n  i believe they're equally important, which is why it's integral to try to establish tone of voice when speaking to someone via writing, whether it's through text message or social media. tone is often lost in text-based messages and can lead to miscommunication.\n  \n  when speaking face to face, what you say and how you say it are equally important because if you say something that's supposed to be helpful but it's in the wrong tone, then the other person could get offended. there are also statements you can say that can be rephrased a different way to convey better understanding.\n  ","410320":"\n  april was somewhat of a turning point for me in terms of my toxic behavior, because i started to regain control of my impulsive behaviors for the first time in years. now that it's been just about a month, i can definitely feel a genuine change within me. and alongside that conscious difference, my relationship has gotten stronger because my boyfriend is essentially my full support system and backbone, cheering me on, because no one else seems to really care.\n  \n  i'm looking forward to progressing more in the month of may, and not only regaining control of my urges but also cultivating more motivation within myself to be healthier.\n  ","410321":"\n  was this a mass message, or just sent to me ?? rofl.\n  \n  i don't really see myself as brave, i'm very much afraid of a lot of things in my life and it prevents me from living my life to the fullest.\n  ","410322":"\n  yeah, you're absolutely right. i honestly can't foresee the day where she would admit that she did something wrong, even if i'm the one who will bring it up to her first (which i can't even fathom doing until i'm 100 percent out of her grasp). she's the type of person to lie through her teeth even if presented with evidence to insist that she's right & everyone else is wrong. even if i brought up the years of ab*se to her, she would tell me that i was being dramatic and probably talk about me breaking down her reputation and making me out to be the enemy.\n  ","410323":"\n  mandrakes ~~\n  ","410324":"\n  as much as it saddens me, i do appreciate that someone understands what it's like to deal with a person like that. my therapist asks me sometimes if i believe i would be able to forgive her, and honestly, i'm not at that point -- nor do i believe i'll ever be at the point of forgiveness. there's still so much anger in me, probably because i still see my mother on a daily basis, so who knows how i'll feel 5-10 years down the road from now.\n  ","410325":"\n  no, she's never seen a psychiatrist and would refuse to acknowledge that she would ever need one. she constantly harasses my father and i for seeing our respective psychiatrists and therapists, and like i stated in my previous answer, she believes she's the only \"sane\" person around. she brags about how she doesn't have any mental health issues, smh.\n  \n  it's honestly something i came to terms with long ago, but the fact that i'm still stuck at homes means that i have to continually deal with it until i find a better living situation.\n  ","410326":"\n  i have considered that extensively, but she doesn't actually have a mental illness as far as i'm aware. i've heard the whole \"narcissistic ab*se\" term thrown around before and i could understand if she had narcissistic traits, but again -- it's something she would never admit to.\n  \n  for example, she frequently exclaims that both my father and i are \"crazy\" and she's the \"only sane person\" in our household. she asks me about my anxiety attacks and depressive episodes and has no clue how to understand them or sympathize with them.\n  \n  even if she *was* mentally ill when she was ab*sing me, that doesn't excuse her actions. you can be mentally ill and have a distinct concept of right vs wrong behavior. mental health doesn't justify toxic or harmful behaviors.\n  ","410327":"\n  unfortunately, she did. she'll never admit now that she said those things when i was growing up, and i know that my memory problems are severe, but i still remember those statements clear as day. she'll probably never admit that she went wrong in her parenting just to keep up her gist of gaslighting me for all of these years, and although i'm hyperaware of her tendencies and behavior now, it doesn't make those statements any less harmful or her attempts at redeeming herself any better.\n  ","410328":"\n  statements along the lines of that they wanted me dead, that i'm a burden to everyone around me, that my life is utterly meaningless, etc etc.\n  ","410329":"\n  i don't remember specifically the times, but i do remember having to wake up around 6am and i would be in school by 8am. my last class ended around 1:30 or 2pm at the latest.\n  ","410330":"\n  there were a lot of rumors going around regarding teachers at my high school, haha. one of the bigger ones was that one of the 10th grade science teachers was addicted to cocaine, because sometimes he would enter the classroom and his eyes were huge and bloodshot and he would do nothing but yell at the kids all day. there were also rumors of teachers sleeping with students (i think one teacher actually did).\n  ","410331":"\n  if my spouse refused to acknowledge that there are problems in the relationship, regardless of how many times i tried to talk to them about it already, then i would inevitably leave the relationship. relationships are not one-sided, and you cannot ignore a person who says that something isn't working anymore & pretend that everything is fine.\n  ","410332":"\n  yes, i know quite a few happy marriages. :'))\n  ","410333":"\n  no, they're married but they're definitely not happy in their marriage. before my mother fell ill, she would talk to me frequently about getting a divorce. however, now my father (and in part myself) is essentially her caretaker, so they're together out of obligation.\n  ","410334":"\n  the majority of my money is spent on my bills, as well as gas for my car, food, coffee, and cigarettes.\n  ","410335":"\n  no, my past doesn't define me. my past *explains* why i behave the way i do, but what defines me currently are my responses to my surroundings and how i can effectively change my behavior that has been ingrained in me from a young age.\n  ","410336":"\n  soda doesn't exactly have any mind-altering substances in it, besides one could argue caffeine, so i don't really see any basis upon which the law could limit how old someone should be to drink soda.\n  \n  but regardless, i do believe soda intake is an issue, particularly in the united states. soda shouldn't be cheaper or more readily available than healthier alternatives, such as water or some forms of juice (although juice has a lot of sugar in it too).\n  ","410337":"\n  my boyfriend and best friend are both inspirations to me. they've both been through a lot of hardship in their lives & have managed to remain motivated and successful in spite of their struggles. they also both struggle with a lot of medical complications, and i've always admired how they rise above their illnesses and don't allow them to get in the way of what they want to do.\n  ","410338":"\n  i enjoy a lot of hobbies, but i seldom get to partake in them. things like playing video games, reading, writing, painting, listening to music, photography, etc etc.\n  ","410339":"\n  it depends on the individual, which is also the point i have been making since last night, lol. there's no clear cut age that someone should or should not date (assuming both parties are over the age of 18), it's simply a matter of life experience, goals, and vigilance.\n  \n  someone who is 19 and the other is 25 could surprisingly work out, while another couple with the same age gap won't work out. everything varies case by case. as long as the younger individual is being hyperaware so that they don't become manipulated.\n  ","410340":"\n  you're right, and that was the point i was making as well. i just don't see how a relationship like that can work out when one person is just entering college and the other already has a career established, for example. there's a large difference in circumstantial life events and milestones.\n  ","410341":"\n  LOL. just pulling sh*t out of their ass to try to prove their point, evidently.\n  ","410342":"\n  yes, i agree. god forbid i get concerned if i hear that a teenager is dating someone who's in their mid-20s, lol.\n  \n  people who are even in their early 20s can be prone to manipulation if there's an obvious power imbalance.\n  ","410343":"\n  why would it matter if the roles were reversed ?? y'all are making it out as if i said it was utterly wrong, when i never said that. lmao. if you read back on my messages from last night, you would see that i would be concerned about the age gap due to potential manipulative behavior.\n  \n  y'all also forget that there was a significant age gap between me and my ex, so.\n  ","410344":"\n  i never said that they were, but it's something to be cautious about regardless. a 19 year old is legally an adult, but they're still a teenager and its perfectly acceptable to be cautious about who a teenager is dating when their partner is in their mid-20s.\n  \n  there's a large potential for manipulative behavior. just because i said that a person *may* have those tendencies doesn't mean they do, or that everyone does. like i stated last night, there will be good men and women who exist among us. unfortunately though, not everyone is a good person.\n  ","410345":"\n  what's wrong with saying that they *may*? not everyone is a good person or has pure intentions.\n  ","410346":"\n  he's five feet, seven inches.\n  ","410347":"\n  i don't expect everyone to agree with me, lol. if i cared about what other people thought, then i wouldn't have voiced my thoughts on the matter.\n  \n  regardless, my opinion wasn't ~~ extreme ~~ or anything -- i basically said it goes on a case by case basis. a 19 year old and a 25 year old aren't necessarily in the same stages of their lives so i don't see how those relationships would work out.\n  ","410348":"\n  i stated in my previous answer that i wasn't single. but yes, i have a boyfriend.\n  ","410349":"\n  no, i'm in a relationship.\n  ","410350":"\n  my week is going all right. i've been sick all week, but i'm slowly getting better. this week is also going by pretty fast for me, i'm happy that its wednesday already.\n  ","410351":"\n  i prefer neither, but if i *had* to pick one, it would be beef.\n  ","410352":"\n  idk what to tell you. i inherited my family's short genes, haha.\n  ","410353":"\n  uh, yeah ?? i wasn't aware that white people can't be short, lmfao. i'm short because my family on my mother's side is short. although, i'm actually the shortest one.\n  ","410354":"\n  LOL, yes i'm a smol bean.\n  ","410355":"\n  no, i don't have solar power unfortunately. i try to make it for it by using energy saving lightbulbs.\n  ","410356":"\n  no, i have one brother.\n  ","410357":"\n  all of their answers are interesting and entertaining to read.\n  ","410358":"\n  i'm five feet tall, lol.\n  ","410359":"\n  two hours per day.\n  ","410360":"\n  it doesn't change the fact that an adult is attracted to someone who is barely legal. if they realize their age and still try to pursue them, then that's predatory behavior. there's no rational reason for a grown adult to pursue a teenager.\n  ","410361":"\n  like i said, it varies and goes on a case by case basis when it comes to that sort of age gap. no doubt there will be some \"good\" guys, but it would personally make me cautious if i knew someone who was around my age and was dating a 19 year old.\n  ","410362":"\n  that's irrelevant, though. that's years down the line, and it has no reflection on the current moment when the 19 year old is still a teenager and the 25 year old is in their mid-20s.\n  ","410363":"\n  perhaps -- in those cases, it really varies because they're still in a \"transition\" stage of life. i would be cautious if i knew someone who was 25 was dating a 19 year old, for example.\n  ","410364":"\n  that's a bit of a borderline situation for me, but overall there's still a large gap in both age and life events. a 19 year old is just starting college, while someone who's 25 has already had their career started. they're in totally different areas of their life so i don't see how that would work.\n  ","410365":"\n  this is true too !! it's completely unnecessary, and guaranteed they also exhibited the same behavior when they were younger, going after

also doesn't matter if they're \"mature for their age\" -- that's hella predatory behavior.\n  ","410368":"\n  yes, that's exactly it. there are only toxic reasons behind it and anyone who tries to justify a 40+ year old trying to date a teenager is scum.\n  ","410369":"\n  although there is a correlation between mental illness and creativity (i believe?), you cannot be so creative that it would

relationships, both platonic and romantic.\n  ","410454":"\n  it's wrong to try to actively change your partner -- the most you can do is talk to them about their wrong behavior and explain why you

to the next step.\n  ","410462":"\n  i wouldn't say never, but if i'm angry with my boyfriend or a close friend, then i prefer to solve the issue immediately. sometimes it's not possible due to me or them being busy, though.\n  ","410463":"\n  if i'm arguing with someone (which is rare, lol) then i normally prefer to solve the issue right away in that moment. there needs to be communication between people, and i fully abide by the saying \"don't go to bed angry\" because it's detrimental to your physical and emotional well being.\n  ","410464":"\n  i wrap it in a towel to get the excess water out, and then i just let it air dry naturally. i don't like applying heat to my hair.\n  ","410465":"\n  probably -- positive reinforcement is very important, and kids need encouragement for them to succeed at the things they're doing.\n  ","410466":"\n  yes, if i have future children then they will do chores around the house. it teaches them how to do simply household things, as well as responsibility and discipline.\n  ","410467":"\n  depends on who it is. if my boyfriend is sad, then it really affects my mood. however, anyone else doesn't have much of an effect on me. if a close friend is sad then i'll feel bad for them, but idk if i would feel sad with them.\n  ","410468":"\n  it depends on a variety of things, because it doesn't necessarily mean he's ignoring you. it could simply mean that he's busy, he hasn't seen it yet, or he doesn't have the energy to respond to it yet.\n  ","410469":"\n  i can certainly dance, but it doesn't mean i dance well.\n  ","410470":"\n  a

the episode either, as well as clegane, theon, and jorah.\n  ","410482":"\n  i've always related to tyrion lannister, LOL. his penchant for drinking and knowledge about various subjects has always resonated with me, and he has always exhibited a logical perspective (which is why he's probably so good at being daenarys' hand).\n  ","410483":"\n  so excited for game of thrones tonight --

likely to pick it up and read the synopsis on the back.\n  ","410487":"\n  i'm generally drawn to people with bright, bold personalities. most of my friends are strong and independent people who aren't afraid to state their opinions regardless of who they're talking to.\n  ","410488":"\n  i mean ... i absolutely love both, lmao. regular french fries are great depending on where i get them from (usually local delis and stuff have amazing french fries), but curly fries are equally as delicious, especially when they're loaded with spices.\n  ","410489":"\n  i like vanilla frosting, but that's pretty much it. i can only have small amounts of it, otherwise it irritates my stomach. i've definitely never eaten a whole can of it, lol that would be a death wish.\n  ","410490":"\n  i'm passionate about animals, so i would definitely be angry with that person over flushing a fish who is alive and well. she definitely *should* have re-homed the fish instead of unnecessarily k*lling it. i don't know if i would necessarily end a friendship over it, but i would certainly be disappointed in them for even thinking that such a thing was okay to do.\n  ","410491":"\n  i'm strongly pro-vaccinations. there's absolutely no reason not to vaccinate your children, and you're putting not only your own child at risk but also other children by not vaccinating against deadly diseases. the rate of measles, for example, has gone up severely over the past few years or so due to the anti-vaxx movement, which is absolutely disgusting to me.\n  \n  i don't believe i have any friends who are anti-vaxx, but if i did, i would certainly talk to them about the benefits of vaccinations and how they're helpful to society.\n  ","410492":"\n  probably not. i don't care about who sends me anonymous messages, and most of the people who send me things anonymously aren't being mean or malicious.\n  ","410493":"\n  i don't have a closet or a bathroom near my room, so this doesn't really apply to me. i keep my bedroom door open, though, because otherwise my room gets pretty stuffy and uncomfortable.\n  ","410494":"\n  i *used* to buy alcohol so i could drink every night, but it's been over a month since i've done that. i've been moderating my alcohol intake and decreasing it severely, and now i've only been drinking every 1-2 weeks at the most.\n  \n  regardless, the drink i bought last night was $2. that isn't exactly expensive, lol.\n  ","410495":"\n  no, i don't believe in destiny. i believe life is more of a domino effect, with each of our actions influencing everything around us, and there's really no pre-determined fate or destiny for us all.\n  ","410496":"\n  the first ones that come to mind are demi lovato & lady gaga. both have been quite open about their struggles with anorexia and bulimia over the years and have donated their time and money to charities related to eating disorder treatment.\n  ","410497":"\n  yes, i'm fairly good at budgeting. i don't normally spend money on things unless absolutely necessary, and when i do splurge, i make sure it's on items that i'll actually use.\n  ","410498":"\n  my app hasn't changed in quite a while.\n

dress for comfort. back in the day, i did wear plaid skinny pants, combat boots, and mostly black clothing. i also colored my hair funky colors and had it in various styles, including a faux hawk, and i had my labret pierced.\n  ","410518":"\n  i suppose my best year was 2009, when i was 17 years old. it was my senior year of high school, so i was excited to leave & move forward with my life. i met my boyfriend and started dating him that year as well, and it inspired a new curiosity about life within me.\n  ","410519":"\n  this is going to sound weird and gross, but i feel nostalgic about my sadness when i was a pre-teen and teenager. i feel as if i had a legitimate reason to be depressed & svicidal back then, meanwhile these days, i don't have a reason -- it just happens without a reason (or if there is, it's insignificant), and it makes me feel guilty.\n  \n  i have this weird sense of nostalgia for those times when i was young, because out of my depression came bouts of creativity. i was bursting at the seams with an almost manic fervor to create, and i wish i still felt that way at times.\n  ","410520":"\n  no, i didn't receive anything special for good grades or good behavior. it was expected of me most of the time, and because i was naturally a good student, i didn't receive praise or anything since it wasn't out of the ordinary for me.\n  ","410521":"\n  my favorite activities\/hobbies from when i was younger are actually the same as the ones i have now -- primarily reading, writing, playing video games, and art. when i was younger, however, i had a lot more time to dedicate to my hobbies than i do now.\n  ","410522":"\n  i have two friends whom i still talk to on a regular basis from my childhood (meaning early teenage years) -- my best friend, and another close friend i've known since i was 13 years old.\n  \n  everyone else has pretty much fallen off the radar, or we've distanced each other for one reason or another. i also didn't grow up having many friends at all.\n  ","410523":"\n  either sushi or scrambled eggs with a side of toasted rye bread.\n  ","410524":"\n  mental illness can't be cured like other physical illnesses. you can go into remission, but you still have the disorder. the best course of treatment is always to consult a professional, whether that's with talk therapy or medication. everyone is different.\n  ","410525":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","410526":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry.\n  ","410527":"\n  i don't, because i'm not. people just don't ask me about why i'm not a good friend, so it isn't something spoken about often.\n  ","410528":"\n  the last time i pushed the boundaries of my comfort zone was  few days ago when i made specific decisions regarding a project i'm working on at work. i was somewhat afraid to make those big decisions because i felt it wasn't really my place to do so, but i stepped forward and gave my input because it was expected of me.\n  ","410529":"\n  i thoroughly enjoy reading the answers of everyone i follow, which is why i follow them in the first place. however, i'm closest to\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  ,\n  \n   @misphire\n  \n  , and\n  \n   @littlesha_\n  \n  .\n  ","410530":"\n  everything i say shows my true colors, lol. my true colors are varied and entirely depend upon my mood in that particular moment.\n  ","410531":"\n  no, not at all. i'm not diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder or consider myself to have that diagnosis. on the contrary, i have borderline personality disorder.\n  ","410532":"\n  i'm neutral towards people, but that doesn't mean i'm not kind to others. i'm usually nice to people unless they give me a reason to behave otherwise.\n  ","410533":"\n  my boyfriend and my best friend, as well as one or two close friends.\n  ","410534":"\n  no, not generally. i only make promises in terms of my work production and my friends\/boyfriend, and i wouldn't want to disappoint them or inconvenience them by not taking responsibility or not fulfilling a promise.\n  \n  i often do things for other people that have no effect on my own well being, and sometimes i'll sacrifice my own happiness to ensure other people are comfortable.\n  ","410535":"\n  no, that's one thing i pride myself on -- my responsibility. i don't make promises unless i'm sure i can keep them, and i'm always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that i fulfill that promise or responsibility. especially when it comes to professional settings.\n  ","410536":"\n  it's incredibly easy for me to lie, but because of that, i try not to lie because i don't want it to become a habit. it also depends on who i'm talking to, because some people are easier to lie to than others. i'll lie to my parents, for instance, but not to my boyfriend or close friends. there's simply no point in lying to them.\n  ","410537":"\n  i'm already female, considering that's my assigned sex. i'm still non-binary regardless of my sex, though, because sex and gender are different entities.\n  ","410538":"\n  death would be a blessing in my eyes because you simply don't suffer when it comes to death. you just cease to exist. and while i wish these people would cease to exist, i wouldn't wish death upon them because that's often the easy way out.\n  ","410539":"\n  i am quite aware of what\n  \n   @CelineM96\n  \n  said. both leigh and lee are used by men and women, thus meaning they're gender neutral.\n  ","410540":"\n  my sympathy has long been lost for certain people, especially those whose presence and behavior leads me to anger episodes.\n  ","410541":"\n  that's the opposite of what\n  \n   @CelineM96\n  \n  said, lol --\n  \n  \"i agree though it's a super neutral name!\"\n  \n  reading comprehension is a gift, my friend.\n  ","410542":"\n  yes, my anger is triggered by the behaviors of certain people in my life, whether they intentionally want to anger me or not. sometimes just a person's presence in my life is enough to set off my anger if i'm already heading towards that mood, since my anxiety and depression sometimes come out in the form of irritability.\n  ","410543":"\n  it makes me wonder if it's a regional thing as well. leigh has always been a gender neutral, almost masculine, name to me because i see more men using it than women. leah & lea are more feminine names in my opinion, while lee is also gender neutral.\n  ","410544":"\n  my emotions can change at the drop of a hat with no rhyme or reason to them. i can go from being in a content mood to feeling completely numb and dissociated (usually triggered by something, though, whether it's significant or insignificant). i also experience bouts of rage, where i do sometimes lose control -- although i've been working on controlling those impulsive behaviors.\n  ","410545":"\n  i don't remember what my first big disappointment was. i can only assume it was in myself, though.\n  ","410546":"\n  leigh is a gender neutral name, actually. it's used for both men and women. the first time i heard that name, it was used by a man.\n  ","410547":"\n  my nickname when i was a pre-teen and teenager was lee. nearly everyone from that time period called me lee, and i enjoyed it because it was gender neutral. as i got older, i changed my nickname to leigh because i felt that it suited me better.\n  ","410548":"\n  i've always wanted to go on a legitimate vacation when i was younger, but my family never did vacations. a lot of people my age were accustomed to taking family vacations during the summer months, and i always wanted to do the same, but it unfortunately never happened. the first actual vacation i took was with friends during my sophomore year of college.\n  ","410549":"\n  i'm going to answer these questions regarding my pre-teen and teenage years, because i don't remember much of my adolescence younger than the age of 11 or so.\n  \n  when i was around that age, the first bands i became interested in were linkin park, evanescence, and korn. i also listened to sum 41, green day, limp bizkit, eminem, hawthorne heights, straylight run, and other bands. i still like some of that music, particularly linkin park and korn, but i haven't heard the other bands\/musicians in years.\n  ","410550":"\n  yeah, i would probably consider them to be racist in that instance. there's absolutely no reason to use racist slurs, and for a person to resort to using slurs when they're in the heat of the moment means that it's almost second nature to them. they may not realize it themselves, though, and they may actually believe that their behavior is okay.\n  ","410551":"\n  YES, ugh. that has happened to me on several occasions, haha. i normally just sit and wait in my car when that happens (unless the place is closed), or i internally battle with myself about just walking in early and seeing what happens. there have been a few occasions where i got to my doctor's appointments super early, but they took me anyway because they didn't have a previous appointment.\n  ","410552":"\n  i don't know much about the loch ness monster, but it wouldn't surprise me if it existed either. like i stated in my previous answer, there's so many things left undiscovered on this earth -- especially when it comes to wildlife in deep lakes and seas -- so it would make sense to have creatures that we didn't know existed previously.\n  ","410553":"\n  i don't know much about bigfoot or the yeti, but it wouldn't surprise me if they were both real. there's still a lot we need to learn about the planet we live on, and there are so many things left undiscovered.\n  ","410554":"\n  no, i don't know how to roller skate. i tried learning once when i was a child, but i was absolutely terrible at it and haven't done it since.\n  ","410555":"\n  yes, i believe in aliens and UFOs. i think it's ignorant to assume that earth is the only planet that can sustain life in this universe, and we simply haven't discovered those planets yet because they're too far out of reach.\n  ","410556":"\n  i had to learn how to parallel park while obtaining my driver's license, but i've only had to do it a handful of times since then. i still remember how, so i think i can still do it effectively, but i almost never need to.\n  ","410557":"\n  aw, i love when people ask me my own questions. normally i try to ask people questions that i would be willing to answer myself, lol.\n  \n  i do believe that i'm holding onto something that i need to let go of, however. sometimes i get into old mindsets from when i was younger, where i become stuck in a depressive mindset and believe that nothing can truly get better. i hold onto that sadness and exasperated feeling, because it became familiar to me and i strangely find comfort in it. it's something i've been trying to work on letting go, because i'm in a different stage of my life now and i don't need to hold onto those feelings anymore.\n  ","410558":"\n  yes, some racist people have the capability to change. i've never witnessed it first-hand either, but i still believe that someone who is racist can realize the toxicity within themselves and actively change their perspectives to be more inclusive.\n  \n  often when this happens, the racist person was simply raised in a racist environment and was conditioned to think the same way. as they get older, they may realize how problematic that mindset was and seek to change themselves.\n  ","410559":"\n  i dislike when a person is disloyal, dishonest, and manipulative. i also don't like when people have an arrogant personality or are willingly close-minded, which usually involves them being racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc etc.\n  \n  i do believe that some people can change their personalities, or at least toxic traits that become apparent to them, as they get older. while we grow up, our traits and interests inevitably change. however, it's also important to note that not everyone evolves as they grow older, and some people retain the same toxic traits that they had when they were younger.\n  ","410560":"\n  well my weekend just started, considering it's not even 10am on saturday morning. however, it's been fine. i just finished my first freelance assignment, and i have about five more before i'm finished for the weekend.\n  \n  physically, i'm still exhausted and rather sick. yesterday, i woke up completely nauseous and dizzy, but i went to work anyway. i ended up leaving early and spent the remainder of the day in bed because my entire body was sore (i suspected that i had a fever). i'm feeling slightly better today, but not 100 percent.\n  ","410561":"\n  yeah, i text my mother sometimes when i'm busy with working on freelance work in my room and don't feel like going downstairs to talk to her. she'll usually text me first and i'll respond accordingly.\n  ","410562":"\n  i like the idea of reincarnation, but i don't personally believe in it. i think it's interesting to fathom the concept of being reborn again into something different, and it certainly would explain if there's life after death, but it isn't something i believe actually exists.\n  ","410563":"\n  i don't know your partner, so i can't really determine if he's racist based solely on this information. he may just be pointing out the differences in culture. however, if this is causing a rift in your relationship then perhaps you should try to talk to him about it more and get him to realize that you're not being over-sensitive. explain that there isn't much of a difference between him and yourself.\n  \n  it makes me wonder if perhaps he's insecure in the relationship considering how often he seems to bring it up. maybe he unconsciously thinks that the differences in culture may not be good for your relationship, although perhaps i'm also overthinking this.\n  ","410564":"\n  i try not to allow my bad habits to hold me back from success, which also includes my mental illnesses. in the past, my anxiety disorder held me back in a lot of different ways, because i was too anxious\/afraid to take new opportunities in fear of failing at them. however, these days i've learned how to properly deal with my anxiety and pursue my goals despite feeling anxious over them. i understand that i shouldn't allow my anxiety to control my life, and i persist in spite of it.\n  ","410565":"\n  i don't believe the average person thinks beyond their immediate surroundings, no. most people are primarily concerned with how things affect their own lives, not so much the lives around them or the world as a whole. i've realized over the past few years that a lot of people also aren't aware of a lot of global affairs and events that *could* affect them in the long run because they don't care about politics, history, current events, etc etc.\n  \n  people don't consider the world beyond themselves because they simply believe that nothing will personally affect them, when that isn't the case at all. there are certain laws that have been passed that will sometimes ultimately affect a person's life, whether they believe it or not.\n  ","410566":"\n  yeah, this happened to me during my high school\/early college years. i wanted to pursue creative writing as a primary subject of study, so i majored in the subject during my freshman year of college. some people around me told me that i wasn't going to find a job in that field because it would essentially be a useless degree, and i didn't believe them at first.\n  \n  however, during the end of my freshman year, i realized that they were somewhat right. it was too specific of a major to really find a versatile array of jobs in the field, not unless i wanted to pursue further education and go into teaching, which i didn't want to do. i changed my major to communications\/professional writing, which is much more diverse because it encompassed not only writing, but also business, marketing, and journalism. since then, i've had two jobs in my field.\n  ","410567":"\n  i don't really know what you mean by \"limits\" in this context. however, there's a large problem with not taking \"no\" for an answer in today's society, especially in terms of dating and consent. a lot of people are under the impression that just because someone *doesn't* say no, it automatically means yes -- when that isn't the case whatsoever.\n  \n  when people don't take \"no\" for an answer, they're essentially forcing themselves upon other people and not willing to accept the truth. they'll continually try to pursue others regardless of the other person's feelings, and it can turn into a red flag for manipulative\/ab*sive behavior.\n  ","410568":"\n  uh, a few weeks ago i tried the chocolate cherry cold brew coffee from dunkin for the first time, lol. it was ridiculously good !! i get it every once in a while now, especially since they have $2 medium cold brews between 2-6pm every day.\n  ","410569":"\n  i believe someone is a bad parent when they're not looking out for the welfare and happiness of their child(ren). these types of people normally care more about themselves than others, including their children, and will go and do things even if it's not in the best interest of their child(ren).\n  ","410570":"\n  normally when i'm asked this question, i say that i wouldn't change anything because i'm currently happy with the way my life is turning out and i wouldn't want the domino effect to change anything about my life in the present.\n  \n  however, i honestly think my life would have turned out *better* had i not endured years of ab*se as a child, which led to the development of my mental illnesses. my mental illnesses aren't usually debilitating, but they have prevented me from taking some opportunities and they make it generally harder for me to live my life. i've nevertheless persisted in spite of them, but they're still there.\n  ","410571":"\n  i would say a 6 or 7. i'm not abnormally intelligent or anything, but i am fairly smart when it comes to certain things. i also had the privilege of going to college and earning a degree, whereas a lot of people in my country don't have that opportunity (which goes to show how truly awful the education system is here).\n  ","410572":"\n  i don't believe i have just one object that's a prized possession of mine. i find sentimental value in the jewelry my boyfriend has bought me, though, so those would probably qualify as prized possessions. i also have a deep connection to a painting he commissioned for me from a friend of ours who's an artist, as well as a signed poster from mike shinoda that's hanging on my wall.\n  ","410573":"\n  i answered this question not too long ago, actually.\n  \n  regardless, to answer your question -- i mainly eat when i feel hungry, but because i have such a regular routine every day, those times are normally the same every day. i usually eat breakfast between 9-10am, lunch between 1-2pm, and dinner between 7-8pm.\n  ","410574":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","410575":"\n  no, i've never been interested in playing PUBG. i've watched my boyfriend play on countless occasions though.\n  ","410576":"\n  a large cup of coffee, a cigarette, and my boyfriend's company.\n  ","410577":"\n  i don't know who either of those people are, so i don't have an opinion.\n  ","410578":"\n  i somewhat agree with it, but i also disagree with it. it's important to surround yourself with people who contribute to your personal growth, and if you feel that you're experiencing low self esteem and that your companions may be adding to those feelings. then you should rid them from your life. it helps to have supportive friends who aid in your development, not stifle it.\n  \n  at the same time, however, depression isn't necessarily caused by being around people who are a**holes, lol. it mainly stems from genetic causes as well as your upbringing. so you could be surrounded by positive people and still have depression, it doesn't discriminate. in that respect, i believe the quote is a bit misguided.\n  ","410579":"\n  no, that's incredibly disrespectful. even if you have a falling out with a friend, you should still respect them enough to keep their secrets to yourself from when they confided in you when you *were* friends. you wouldn't want someone doing that to you, so why would you do that to someone else ??\n  ","410580":"\n  i just emailed a tattoo artist i've been following for a while in the hopes of setting a consultation and\/or appointment with her, yeee. i haven't gotten a tattoo in years, and i'm overdue for some new ink.\n  \n  now i'm anxious af because i'm afraid she's not going to get back to me, lmao. i found her email on the tattoo shop's website, so i hope she still uses it !!\n  ","410581":"\n  not really, no. i like moderately spicy food, but anything hotter than that is way too much for me.\n  ","410582":"\n  i'm somewhat good at identifying toxic traits in myself if they become apparent enough, but i also require other people telling me if i'm being toxic because sometimes i also don't realize it.\n  \n  recently, i have had to overcome my drinking habit because it was becoming problematic and toxic to other people in my life, particularly my boyfriend. i was drinking 4-5 nights per week and often getting blackout drunk, and it wasn't healthy for either my physical or mental health. so i've recently cut down severely on when i do drink, and i also don't allow myself to get drunk anymore if i do decide to have a drink at night.\n  \n  it's been difficult admitting that i have a problem, but it's better to acknowledge it rather than ignore it.\n  ","410583":"\n  i would absolutely love to be able to teleport, lol. it would be so much easier to teleport to where i need to go instead of driving or taking public transportation.\n  ","410584":"\n  one of my favorite books is \"girl interrupted\" by susanna kaysen. i read it for the first time while i was still in high school, and it was an amazing introduction to the struggles of mental illness for me, and it made me feel less alone in my battles. it also gave me insight into borderline personality disorder, which i was later diagnosed with when i entered my 20s.\n  ","410585":"\n  above all else, i admire honesty and loyalty in other people. it's rare to see people who are true to themselves and true to their friends these days, and are willing to talk to their friends or partners when necessary to implement real change in their lives.\n  \n  a trait i despise in other people is dishonesty and manipulative behavior. i won't associate with anyone who exhibits those traits.\n  ","410586":"\n  i graduated high school 10 years ago. my life has gotten better since high school, since i struggled a lot of mental illness during that time. i honestly didn't think i would be alive to see my 18th birthday, let alone live to be 27 years old.\n  \n  since graduating, i received my driver's license, held three jobs, and graduated from college with a bachelor's degree. my mental health has gotten significantly better and i entered a great relationship, where my partner is fully supportive of me and understands my mental health. i also let go of old, toxic friendships and gained new friends in return.\n  ","410587":"\n  no, i have no interest in modeling.\n  ","410588":"\n  not that i'm aware of. if someone hated me that much, they never made it known to me.\n  ","410589":"\n  no, i don't believe so. i don't have any enemies, as far as i'm aware.\n  ","410590":"\n  yes, it's common knowledge that photographers and models photoshop their pictures to give a \"flawless\" appearance.\n  ","410591":"\n  i've never been in an ab*sive relationship before, but i do know that it is extremely difficult for people to escape from those kinds of relationships. you never know that a person is ab*sive from the beginning, and it develops over time without you even realizing that it's becoming ab*sive until it's too late.\n  \n  in such cases, it's hard for people to leave those relationships because they fear for their lives, that their partner will retaliate against them for leaving and hurt them. that's why there are shelters for domestic ab*se survivors, it gives them a safe place to live while they're trying to leave a relationship.\n  ","410592":"\n  LOL. yes, it often confuses me when my coworkers or supervisor exclaim how hard of a worker i am, when really i don't believe the work i do is very in-depth or hard at all. i suppose i've just always been naturally good at time management, so it appears that i work really hard when the material actually comes very easily to me.\n  ","410593":"\n  i prefer shopping online. i don't like going into stores and dealing with people in the stores. i usually find better things online than in stores anyway, and they're normally cheaper with better coupons.\n  ","410594":"\n  to the anon who was asking about SH and intrusive thoughts --\n  \n  sorry, askfm deleted my answer because of the content of the post. however, to reiterate, yes i do experience thoughts of h*rting myself and sometimes others, and i get intrusive thoughts frequently. sometimes they're stronger at night, but it mostly happens whenever i get into a depressive or \"dangerous\" mindset where i'm feeling destructive or s*icidal.\n  ","410595":"\n  i would ask my parents why they thought they raised me well, when my memories indicate that they did nothing but emotionally & physically ab*se me during the early years of my life.\n  \n  to this day, whenever i express some sort of negative emotion or feeling of depression or anxiety, my mother claims \"i raised you so well, i don't know why you came out this way,\" which has always been incredibly invalidating.\n  ","410596":"\n  it ultimately depends on the culture the woman gets married into, whether or not that culture is tolerant of women having freedoms, as well as the relationship as a whole. in addition, it also depends on the woman's willingness to immerse herself in that particular culture, because some people are more adaptable than others.\n  \n  depending on the couple's relationship, it could negatively affect their children's lives, but i think that has more to do with parenting styles as opposed to cultural norms. there generally isn't a bad connotation to being raised in various cultures unless that culture is inherently oppressive. one of my cousins married an indian man a few years ago, and they often travel to india to spend time with his family. it simply works for them.\n  ","410597":"\n  yeah, absolutely.

watching movies or shows through pirating websites. my perspective is that those movies & shows already make more than enough money through regular avenues, and it wouldn't make a difference if a small percentage of people pirated their content instead of contributing money towards the content in the first place. they're big corporations\/productions.\n  \n  there's also the dilemma of what

comfortable to them.\n  ","410607":"\n  he told me, which was a small component in why i forgave him. he was eaten up by guilt and couldn't hide it from me, so he ended up telling me one night soon

my partner in general.\n  \n  i wouldn't say that i would *never* forgive a partner for cheating, because i did forgive my boyfriend for cheating on me much earlier in our relationship, but i believe

happening right now. i feel feverish, my body is sore, i'm incredibly congested, i keep sneezing and coughing, and i have a constant headache at the front of my skull.\n  \n  if this persists until next week, then i'll definitely see a doctor because i might need some sort of medication. i'm not going to waste money on a co-pay if it isn't that serious and all they'll tell me is to rest and drink liquids, though.\n  ","410616":"\n  OH, LOL. sorry, i didn't realize that was what you meant.\n  \n  i don't ask for them to pay me for watching their dogs, no. i've been best friends with her since we were both 13 years old, and it's the least i can do for them. it's also beneficial for me because it means i can stay at their house and enjoy the peace and quiet for a change.\n

embarrassed me in public that long ago.\n  ","410620":"\n  i believe it depends on what message you're trying to convey. when you miss hanging out with someone, it gives off a different connotation than when you miss who an individual is as a person.\n  \n  also, when you say \"i miss you,\" it gives off the impression that you have deep feelings for someone -- unless you already have a close relationship with that person, then it's no big deal. if all you feel is that you miss seeing someone, then perhaps saying \"i miss hanging out with you\" is more precise and to the point.\n

personality disorder.\n  \n  when i'm feeling down, i ultimately have to wait until the episode passes because nothing can really make me feel \"better\" otherwise. i have really unhealthy coping mechanisms at the moment, but i also do try to talk out my feelings with trusted friends, which can aid the situation temporarily.\n  ","410626":"\n  yes, i agree with you. entry-level jobs usually require a bachelor's degree or more of experience, although it depends entirely on job to job. i wouldn't have had the experiences i have with jobs had i not acquired a bachelor's degree first.\n

see the sun rise.\n  ","410629":"\n  yes !! i watched it the other day. i thought it was a good episode tbh. my coworkers seem to think it was \"boring,\" but i really enjoyed the interactions between various characters who haven't seen each other in literally years. and, of course, the knighting of brienne was absolutely amazing. i teared up knowing how happy she was in that moment.\n

french, but i've since forgotten the language because it's been about 10 years since i've practiced. however, the best way to learn a language is to study it extensively & try to practice it whenever

keyboard, and ukulele when i was a teenager, but i've long forgotten how to play or even read music. :\/\/\n  ","410646":"\n  i'm actually in a fairly decent mood rn. i was extremely productive at work today and managed to finish everything that was on my personal agenda, which was fantastic. i'm a bit nervous, however, because my supervisor said i have to train someone tomorrow, and i always feel anxious when put in positions like that.\n  \n  other than that, i'm good. i'm currently drinking iced coffee and waiting for my phone to charge before i go over my boyfriend's house for the

try to view things from different perspectives to gain a wider understanding of a topic or person.\n  ","410655":"\n  i dislike when the media narrates a story to insinuate that a person is\/was dangerous *because* of their mental illness, not because of their pre-existing traits which determined their violent behavior. it's statistically more common for those with mental illness to be victims of violent crimes, not the perpetrator themselves. however, there's still a lot of stigma that exists in news stories regarding violent criminals if they happen to have an existing mental health problem ; they blame it entirely on the illness and give off the impression that *everyone* with that illness is dangerous -- when that's simply not true.\n  ","410656":"\n  no, i don't have

margarita.\n  ","410658":"\n  i don't like pulling pranks on people, nor do i enjoy when pranks are pulled on me. i find most of them to be extremely childish and immature.\n  ","410659":"\n  music brings people together !! i've always been an advocate for musical expression because music is a big passion of mine. it not only serves as a coping mechanism, but it also brings people together in harmony.\n  ","410660":"\n  taking the anonymous feature away wouldn't bother or affect me at all because i don't send things to people anonymously. regardless, i'm sure those who want to stay anonymous would just make blank accounts to send things to people instead of just remaining \"anonymous.\" it's easy to make an account and not fill anything in besides the username while still hiding your identity.\n  ","410661":"\n  no, i wouldn't take that option. i would be far too anxious and paranoid for the rest of my days, because all i would think about would be that date.\n

year, lol. i would feel a lot more comfortable with myself.\n  ","410668":"\n  just fyi, this is a pretty insensitive question to ask someone -- especially if you just happen to be talking to a person with an eating disorder or disordered eating habits.\n  \n  to answer your question, the longest i've gone without eating has been a few days. i don't remember how many days exactly because it was

a firm control over my anger, especially within the past few months. my impulse control has been so poor lately that every time i feel a rush of a strong emotion, i have no idea how to handle it. normally i resort to chain smoking or drinking alcohol, but i've been trying hard to resist those urges.\n  ","410671":"\n  it's been a while since i even had an opportunity to make friends with someone. i don't know if i would consider my coworkers to be my friends, since they're my coworkers first and foremost. minus work relationships, the last time i actually went out of my way to try to make friends was when i was still attending college.\n  ","410672":"\n  i didn't before getting this question, but now i'm aware of who she is.\n  ","410673":"\n  i had a turkey sandwich for lunch

few months ago when we went out to the bar. some guy was trying to talk to her & he was being a real creep about it, so i told him that neither of us were interested in a conversation with him and he would be better off leaving us alone.\n  \n  needless to say, he walked away. lmao.\n  ","410682":"\n  i believe people should practice compassion for others more often. everyone is going through some struggle or hardship, and it's easy to forget that people have their own lives apart from what we see on social media or in real life. it's often the case that people who are struggling don't portray those feelings to others, and it would be helpful if we're all more compassionate and understanding towards others on a regular basis.\n  ","410683":"\n  (cont) I feel he won\u2019t leave her though

sometimes, especially at work.\n  ","410754":"\n  yes, i've been discriminated against due to both my sexual orientation and my gender. people don't seem to like being confronted with things that don't make them personally comfortable, so my existence has nevertheless made people angry.\n  ","410755":"\n  LOL. i'm not too well versed in the whole \"cancelled\" culture, but regardless, if someone makes a homophobic remark, then they should be educated on why they're wrong and being discriminatory. if they refuse to acknowledge their mistake, then there unfortunately isn't much else you can do for them besides refuse to associate with them and cut them out of your life.\n  ","410756":"\n  homophobia is disgusting, and if someone actually embraces their homophobic beliefs and willingly disregards and discriminates against people in the lgbtq+ community, then i have absolutely no desire to put up with that nonsense.\n  ","410757":"\n  i literally just answered this same exact question 4 minutes ago.\n  ","410758":"\n  i'm doing all right. today has been a rather unproductive day -- i woke up super late at 10:30am, only wrote four freelance assignments (usually i write six), and basically spent the entire day on my laptop while drinking coffee. i took a thicc nap before, as well.\n  \n  now i'm just waiting for my boyfriend to get out of work to see if he's up to hanging out tonight, and if not, then i'll probably just go to bed early.\n  ","410759":"\n  no, i'm not single.\n  ","410760":"\n  \"what's your opinion on something that some people prefer when finding a partner that has no effect on your life whatsoever.\"\n  ","410761":"\n  i don't think i would necessarily enjoy living in a time period other than the one we're living in now, especially considering how destitute the middle class was in previous eras and how women were silenced.\n  \n  however, i always found the victorian era and the french revolution to be interesting periods of time. it would be remarkable to witness the events that happened during those years.\n  ","410762":"\n  when i play video games, i normally restrict my playing to one save file that i invest all of my energy into, and if i do something wrong, then i go back into the last save and restart the mission. i don't accept anything less than perfection in my gaming, which makes it arduous for me to complete a game.\n  \n  if my life was akin to a video game, then i would likely still only have one save file, but a lot of rewrites involved. if i made a hazardous mistake, i would immediately go back in time to fix it, even down to the little things like if i said something wrong in a conversation.\n  \n  my achievements would be small victories related to mental health, i.e. \"got out of bed!\" , \"took a shower and brushed your teeth!\" , \"drove to work without having an anxiety attack!\" etc etc. i've always loved getting achievements on xbox, so i would probably find a lot of little ones everywhere that were worth 5 points, lmao.\n  ","410763":"\n  quite often, actually. it normally happens when i'm under immense stress and my mind is racing with everything i'm trying to accomplish or take control.\n  ","410764":"\n  one of the facets of borderline personality disorder that i deal with has to do with identity disturbance -- meaning an unclear sense of identity or void of a sense of self. it's something i've dealt with for my entire life, from what i remember, but i never knew there was an actual word for it until i was diagnosed a few years ago.\n  \n  my interests change frequently and are often the reflection of the interests of whoever i'm attached to at that current moment. if someone i'm attached to is into photography, then i pick up the hobby. if they're enthusiastic about going out and drinking, then i go out and drink with them. i have a few hobbies that i found i genuinely enjoyed, such as writing and video games, but even then, they're primarily influenced by someone else.\n  \n  my early childhood undoubtedly had a huge factor in why i developed BPD. studies have shown that BPD arises out of a combination of environmental and genetic factors, and because of my past history of trauma, it's suspected that my environment caused my development of BPD. my episodes are still in existence, despite being in routine treatment, because i'm still in the environment where i was raised. i don't believe i'll be able to recover until i'm out of my parents' house, because at that point i can start my own life on my own terms.\n  ","410765":"\n  if i'm feeling a particular craving that day, then i'll suggest that restaurant and see how my boyfriend or friend feels about it. there's a handful of regular places we frequent, and it's mostly because they're local to us and had good reviews. whenever my boyfriend and i go out to eat, we'll either go to a diner or a steakhouse. my friends normally prefer mexican food places.\n  ","410766":"\n  there's a client that i dealt with once a few months ago who got struck by lightning and believed that he got a \"power\" from god as a result, which is a bit far-fetched in my opinion.\n  \n  i also dealt with ridiculous customers on a daily basis when i worked in retail, as well. there were so many people who would get so hot-headed and irrational if you told them that you couldn't fulfill their wishes, whether that was using a coupon, getting a sales price, etc etc. they would get angry if their coupon was expired or if they were looking at the wrong sales tag, and they blamed it on the workers instead of themselves.\n  ","410767":"\n  i'm nicer than him in general, but it all depends on our separate moods that particular moment. he has no problem saying exactly what he thinks with no filter whatsoever, and it doesn't matter who's talking to him -- he'll tell them to go f*ck themselves, even if it's his boss or a customer, if the situation warrants it.\n  ","410768":"\n  you meant *hypothetically, lol.\n  \n  i don't believe i would date someone who has a child, no. i'm not at a stage in my life where i would feel comfortable being responsible, even partially, for a child. i don't know if i even want children in the future to begin with.\n  ","410769":"\n  it depends on my mood, but i would only allow him one small sip -- if anything. but that's assuming he would actually ask me, because like i stated in my previous answer, he knows better than to ask for a sip of my coffee.\n  ","410770":"\n  he knows not to touch my coffee, so he's never asked. lmao.\n  \n  i don't care if you think it's greedy. coffee is sacred to me.\n  ","410771":"\n  i have absolutely zero talents, so no.\n  ","410772":"\n  i suppose i would be a wolf, because i've always felt a close connection to wolves from a young age. i even have a wolf tattooed on my body.\n  ","410773":"\n  coffee, lol. if i have a cup of coffee in front of me, i will fight you tooth-and-nail if you want a small portion of it. i don't care if i have a large cup -- this coffee is mine, and if you want coffee too, then make yourself your own cup. i'm never sharing.\n  ","410774":"\n  no, i never learned how to ride a bicycle.\n  ","410775":"\n  i have very pin-straight hair, unfortunately. i wish it was wavier or curlier, but even when it was very short, it was still straight.\n  ","410776":"\n  no, i don't bother painting my toenails. further questions regarding toes and feet will be deleted.\n  ","410777":"\n  i'm a very heavy sleeper. almost nothing can wake me up except for my alarm clock in the morning, and sometimes that doesn't work either. :\/\/\n  ","410778":"\n  you're not \"standing for the lives of innocent children\" -- you're clearly unhappy with how\n  \n   @littlesha_\n  \n  conducts her life and will do everything in your power to prevent her from doing what she wants to do. you couldn't care less about the children.\n  \n  pro tip ; nothing you say, to anyone, is going to change the fact that morgan is going to do what she wants. you can vent and complain and whine to your heart's content, but it isn't going to change a thing. you're wasting your breath.\n  ","410779":"\n  i don't know much information about anonymous donors to have a *really* informed opinion -- however, my concern with anonymity is that you don't know the donor's medical history, and therefore, you don't know what potential the child has of developing certain illnesses, whether that occurs in their childhood or adulthood.\n  \n  if a donor has family history of diabetes or heart disease, then that's something i would want to know about so that i can take the proper precautions early on in that child's life to prevent them from developing heart disease and diabetes. it's also useful to know if alcoholism runs in the donor's family, if there's a history of mental illness, etc etc. i would want what's best for my child and that includes full awareness of the medical dilemmas that may occur as they get older.\n  ","410780":"\n  technically i have both saturday and sunday off from my regular office job, but i do pick up freelance assignments that i complete on the weekends too.\n  \n  i don't have any plans for tomorrow, even though it's easter sunday. i might have dinner with my family (it's currently planned, but who knows what will happen between today & tomorrow). otherwise, it's just a normal sunday to me.\n  ","410781":"\n  probably about a week or so during one of my severe depressive episodes. it was hard enough to even get out of bed and use the bathroom, let alone take a shower and wash my hair.\n  ","410782":"\n  thoroughbred refers to a pure-blooded horse.\n  ","410783":"\n  uh, no ?? lmao. i would be fired if i fell asleep at work.\n  ","410784":"\n  i agree -- there's absolutely no reason to be so emotionally invested in another person's life like this unless you hold some deep, intimate feelings towards them, whether that's a love for them or such a hatred towards yourself that you release that frustration on others.\n  ","410785":"\n  it depends entirely on the company. it isn't a new york-based thing at all, it just varies wildly depending on the company you work for.\n  ","410786":"\n  i don't believe you qualify for routine raises at my job unless you've been there for a certain number of years. i just got my first raise a few weeks ago & i've been there for 1.5 years, and i'm also scheduled for another employment review in an additional three months.\n  \n  i don't know what a \"normal\" raise consists of, considering i assume it's different depending on that particular person's aptitude and salary. i don't discuss finances with my coworkers, though.\n  ","410787":"\n  i guess teenagers who babysit for extra cash shouldn't be allowed to do so either, considering they also don't have professionals degrees or experience in childhood courses.\n  \n  in all seriousness, though -- your obsession with morgan is a bit concerning. you come into my inbox every once in a while when morgan puts you in your rightful place, complaining about something occurring in her life that doesn't please you. perhaps instead of worrying about what someone else does with their life, you should focus more on improving your *own* life instead.\n  ","410788":"\n  i don't normally ask for the price of things because prices are normally always listed wherever i go. i do try to order inexpensive food items, though, unless i want a particular food item a lot.\n  \n  i don't really know if it's a \"new yorker\" thing to do, lmao. i don't pay much attention to stereotypes like that.\n  ","410789":"\n  it isn't something that has ever crossed my mind. nearly everyone i know says \"halal food\" around here. i don't care enough to determine whether or not it's linguistically correct.\n  ","410790":"\n  i prefer gritty action films over horror films. i've noticed that as i've gotten older, horror movie scare me more & more, and it interrupts my sleeping patterns because i get far too paranoid.\n  ","410791":"\n  i've only ever ordered street food in new york city on a few occasions, and it was pretty good. i normally would just grab a hot dog or some halal food.\n  ","410792":"\n  i didn't have to pay for tuition while i was attending college -- you only begin paying back on your student loans after a year of graduating (so i began paying my loans in 2014).\n  \n  the only things i had to pay for during college were my textbooks, and i paid for those myself because i was working a part-time (and sometimes full-time) job.\n  ","410793":"\n  i took out loans from the bank. i'll probably be paying them off until my 40s, lmao.\n  ","410794":"\n  in my opinion, the most rewarding experience of my life has been having the opportunity to attend college. my freshman year, i dormed in a liberal arts college in massachusetts, and then for the remaining 3.5 years, i commuted to a local university near my home. both schools gave me tons of experience and education, and i value the knowledge i received during my time in school.\n  ","410795":"\n  ^^\n  \n  for any of my followers who are looking for some encouragement.\n  ","410796":"\n  this is a great initiative, but you're also anonymous.\n  ","410797":"\n  i don't eat candy or chocolate. sometimes i'll have one bite of chocolate if someone offers it to me, but otherwise i don't generally eat it. even small amounts of candy or chocolate give me a stomach ache.\n  ","410798":"\n  yes, i work better when i'm faced with a deadline actually. i've spent the majority of my life in situations where i was forced to work under immense pressure and had no option but to give optimal results. it's something i eventually got used to as i got older.\n  ","410799":"\n  i consider myself to be somewhat intelligent, but i'm not mechanically-minded enough to invent something on my own. my intelligence is mainly in the form of analytical thinking and understanding complex ideas, not so much constructing something.\n  \n  my boyfriend, on the other hand, is extremely mechanically-inclined. he's intelligent in his own right and can construct things from blueprints to reality with ease. it's something i've always admired.\n  ","410800":"\n  underestimate myself.\n  \n  i used to underestimate myself in the past because i had little to no faith in my own potential, but as i've gotten older, i've come to realize how strong i truly am and how motivated i can be to accomplish my own goals.\n  ","410801":"\n  i used to wholeheartedly believe in reincarnation when i was younger (like a teenager), but now i'm not so sure that i believe in it anymore. it's an interesting perspective and it would give me further hope for traversing life in itself, but it doesn't seem \"realistic\" enough to me, and i don't have enough faith in religious\/spiritual things like that to hold that belief anymore.\n  ","410802":"\n  probably sting (frodo's sword from the lord of the rings trilogy). the LOTR films are among my favorite movies, and i've always had a great interest in swords and knives.\n  ","410803":"\n  i would *love* to own a house somewhere in west virginia or north carolina, deep within the woods on the outskirts of a town. alternatively, my best friend recently moved to new hampshire and the surrounding area where she lives is absolutely beautiful, and she loves it there.\n  ","410804":"\n  i don't feel desperation very often at all, so i'm not entirely sure. the only thing i can think of would probably be feeling desperate to have a cigarette after a particularly stressful day.\n  ","410805":"\n  i prefer cold weather over hot weather, if i had to choose between the two. i can't tolerate the heat and humidity.\n  ","410806":"\n  i don't generally shop for new clothing during the change of seasons, although i did buy two tank tops a few weeks ago off of amazon. as for cleaning, i try to clean well every week so that isn't a seasonal thing for me either.\n  ","410807":"\n  neither, i prefer it to be comfortable.\n  ","410808":"\n  no, it wouldn't be possible for me to watch television while working because it would ruin my concentration. i'm also pretty certain that i would get in trouble at work if they discovered i was watching a show while working, lol.\n  ","410809":"\n  it would be harder for me to tell someone that i do not love them in return. i've never had an issue expressing my feelings of love or gratitude toward my friends or partner, but it would be much more difficult for me to confide in someone that their feelings aren't reciprocated.\n  ","410810":"\n  i judge people by their character -- how they treat others in social situations, how they view strangers, how they treat their friends and significant others, and how they work (whether or not they have a hard work ethic).\n  ","410811":"\n  i think it's usually valid to concern ourselves with things that normally cannot be explained. just because we cannot explain them doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile to discuss them and come to possible conclusions.\n  ","410812":"\n  spirited away !! it's one of my favorite animated movies.\n  \n  when i think about that movie, the first scene that always comes to mind is the scene where the girls are feeding no face in the bath house, and he's absolutely gorging himself on food. it's one of the most iconic moments of that movie.\n  ","410813":"\n  because of my job, it's impossible for me to give into writer's block because i write assignments for programs on a daily basis. i can't afford to have writer's block because the features need to be written one way or another, and i always try my best to give the client my best effort in making their feature interesting and concise.\n  \n  at the same time, though, i also haven't written anything creatively in a long time. :\/\/ all of my efforts go toward writing at work, so when i'm home, i feel absolutely burnt out.\n  ","410814":"\n  no, i don't post those sorts of pictures.\n  ","410815":"\n  i like the satisfaction of finding the right words to use to portray the feeling i'm trying to describe, especially when i weave those words into a sentence that sounds particularly strong or appealing. i've thankfully always had a way with my words (written down, at least), so it's cathartic for me to get things down on paper.\n  ","410816":"\n  does beginning a new project at work count towards this ?? haha. when i took on this program after the previous administrator left on maternity leave, it was something i didn't really know how to do, so i had to teach myself along the way. it was daunting at first -- but now it's been three weeks since i've been running the program by myself, and i'm finally comfortable doing it.\n  ","410817":"\n  a cup of coffee from starbucks. my mother wanted a large iced latte, and the price for one of those is at least $5, which is ridiculous. especially considering it's mostly milk.\n  ","410818":"\n  yes, i believe that self love can be difficult for some people. especially people who have been raised in environments where they were never taught how to love themselves. it's such a radical departure from the way we've been raised, so it can be hard to navigate how exactly to love yourself and where to even begin.\n  ","410819":"\n  probably any of the s*xual questions that get sent to my inbox, which i wind up deleting. i don't generally entertain those anons anymore.\n  ","410820":"\n  i use too face's born this way foundation & concealer. it provides me with the best coverage, in my opinion, and it's also very light and doesn't feel as if i'm wearing a lot of product on my skin.\n  ","410821":"\n  billie eilish, matt maeson, hozier, grandson, ariana grande, watsky, grieves, colter wall, two feet, and rainbow kitten surprise.\n  ","410822":"\n  i'm active. :'))\n  \n  you can also follow\n  \n   @Courrtana\n  \n  ,\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  , and\n  \n   @littlesha_\n  \n  .\n  ","410823":"\n  it doesn't bother me, but i do delete them immediately. i have no interest in checking out someone else's music\/project\/etc etc.\n  \n  however, i do think it can also deter people from checking out their content because they're doing it in such a forceful manner. if they posted it on their own page every now and again and promoted it to their own followers, they might have a better chance of their content being seen.\n  ","410824":"\n  LOL. like i said, i'll take your word for it.\n  ","410825":"\n  graduating from college -- it was something i didn't think i would be able to do given my mental health issues and how i was also working basically full-time while attending school. but regardless, i did graduate with latin honors, and that's something i'm very proud of.\n  ","410826":"\n  i'll take your word for it then. i don't answer the door for delivery people generally, so the chance is this happening is slim to none. but perhaps it did happen and i simply don't remember it.\n  ","410827":"\n  that's literally never happened to me. lmfao.\n  ","410828":"\n  i honestly don't remember. i don't get embarrassed easily.\n  ","410829":"\n  i just woke up, so i'm having a cigarette and i'm going to make a cup of coffee soon.\n  ","410830":"\n  yes, he did. or a regular suit -- i don't really remember.\n  ","410831":"\n  a short, silver dress.\n  ","410832":"\n  probably, i'm sure it played at my prom.\n  ","410833":"\n  yes, perhaps too many times. it used to play on the radio constantly.\n  ","410834":"\n  i haven't played video games in a while tbh. there's nothing that i'm excited for these days, unless i want to go back and try to grind more on destiny 2 or restart fallout 4 again. while i liked fallout 76, it didn't captivate my interest very much at all.\n  \n  i do like playing with friends though !! me and a few of my friends were playing ultimate chicken horse a few weeks ago, and i was just chatting with\n  \n   @HeartOfStitches\n  \n  on his stream while he was playing jackbox. :'))\n  ","410835":"\n  yes and no ... while i've been feeling more stable with respect to my mood swings, i've also been incredibly impulsive and reckless when it comes to my drinking habits, which i've been trying hard to cut back on (which isn't working well, considering i'm drinking rn).\n  \n  i don't know -- there must be some psychological reason behind why i want to drink so often, but i don't really know why it is. it's something i'll have to discuss in therapy.\n  ","410836":"\n  if i'm being honest here, i'm not entirely sure. lmao.\n  \n  i just got a promotion less than a month ago, so for now i'm okay. however, i would like to be given more responsibility in the future and get another raise. perhaps administrating more programs other than the two i'm in control of now, since they're both relatively slow at the moment.\n  ","410837":"\n  i'm up for anything. :')) if i had a preference, i would like to answer more questions related to mental health, my relationship, my career\/education, my hobbies (video games, writing, photography, and art), and perhaps some controversial opinions.\n  ","410838":"\n  i first suspected that i had a mental illness when i was 13 years old, because i had been struggling with depression for about a year at that point and figured that something was \"wrong\" with me. i developed svicidal thoughts early on, but i wasn't really aware at that time that what i was feeling wasn't healthy or normal.\n  \n  i was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was 24 years old, and i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder a year later at 25 years old.\n  ","410839":"\n  i'm really digging the blue tbh. however, before this, i had purple hair with streaks of lighter lavender and magenta, which was really nice.\n  ","410840":"\n  LOL. as long as you take care of it from the very beginning, they should last a long time. and you can always touch it up if necessary too !! my boyfriend just got two tattoos with fine lines in them, so i'll see how they age over time.\n  ","410841":"\n  ah, that's terrible. :\/\/ i would hope so too, but there's a lot of friction and homophobia within the gay community as well.\n  ","410842":"\n  i have absolutely zero gang tattoos, considering i've never been in a gang.\n  ","410843":"\n  i think it's faded a little bit, but that's pretty much it. however, my oldest tattoo is on my back, so i can't really see it. lmao.\n  ","410844":"\n  hello !!\n  \n  anyone have any questions ?? i'll be awake for the next hour or two, so i'll answer nearly anything. xx\n  ","410845":"\n  unfortunately, there isn't much you can do in such a situation. :\/\/ if someone doesn't understand that they're mentally ill or in need of help, then they won't accept any help or acknowledge that they have a problem to begin with. you can tell them to infinity that their behavior or feelings are abnormal, but if they insist that there's nothing wrong, there isn't much you can do to help them.\n  ","410846":"\n  sorta, yeah. however, it's more along the lines of gay people discriminating against other gay people or exhibiting homophobic thoughts, even though they're gay themselves. i.e., feminine gay men discriminating against masculine gay men because they don't fit the \"stereotype\" of being a gay man.\n  ","410847":"\n  probably, but to be fair, i normally cry over things for no reason whatsoever so it isn't unusual for me.\n  ","410848":"\n  no, i never have before. it makes me uncomfortable even getting blood drawn at the lab.\n  ","410849":"\n  roller coasters actually are a major source of anxiety for me, lol. i was always afraid to go on them in fear that i would get hurt, and i was also uncomfortable with the adrenaline rush i would feel when i was on them because i felt too out of control of myself.\n  ","410850":"\n  quit drinking alcohol, lose 50-60 pounds, move into an apartment or house with my boyfriend, adopt animals, get promoted at my job again, and travel more often.\n  ","410851":"\n  girl interrupted by susanna kaysen.\n  \n  it was the first book that introduced me to mental health and how it was acceptable to raise awareness of your own mental health and seek help when necessary. i didn't know much about my own mental state beforehand, i just knew that my feelings were severe and abnormal, but the book introduced me to new concepts and i was able to relate to the main character's feelings a lot.\n  ","410852":"\n  i truly value my internal drive and motivation. regardless of what has happened to me, i've always possessed a desire to do more and do better than how i previously was. i've never allowed anything to strike me down for longer than it was necessary, and i've always reinvented myself with each hardship to create a better version of myself.\n  ","410853":"\n  i can be a control freak at times, but only when it concerns projects that i work on myself, where my name is attached to whatever the project is. i was terrible at group projects when i was in high school & college because i always double-checked everyone else's work to make sure it was up to par. i didn't want to risk my grade because someone else didn't do their part.\n  ","410854":"\n  yeah, i believe so. my high school only had a certain amount to spend when it came to their budget, which was terrible, but the teachers i had did the best with what they were given. they even went the extra mile and utilized things from their own homes and pockets to make it a more immersive learning experience for us.\n  ","410855":"\n  oh, hell yes. let us live eternally and feast on the blood of mortals.\n  ","410856":"\n  definitely not. i can't even gain control over my own life, let alone an entire country. lmao.\n  ","410857":"\n  educate the homophobic person, if possible. if they're still resistant to being educated about the lgbtq+ community, then the best thing you can do is simply ignore them.\n  ","410858":"\n  i should definitely watch it some day. i heard amazing reviews on it, but i hardly ever watch movies to begin with.\n  ","410859":"\n  no, i never saw it. i think it's on netflix, though.\n  ","410860":"\n  i don't know about my coworkers, but i mostly arrive to work on time. i'm only late perhaps twice a month at the most.\n  ","410861":"\n  i don't normally do anything for easter, it isn't a holiday that my family celebrates. occasionally we'll have a family dinner, but it's rare.\n  ","410862":"\n  the number 23 haunts me, lmao.\n  ","410863":"\n  alt 92.3 (although you won't be able to listen to

cheekbones and a penetrating gaze, and has dimples when he smiles.\n  ","410865":"\n  it's always a long day without coffee. however, that rarely happens. even if i know i'm going to be late for work, i stop for coffee anyway, lmao.\n  ","410866":"\n  i think he's the perfect actor to play thor, lol. i've only seen the movie thor and the avengers, but his role made me laugh.\n  ","410867":"\n  i'm doing well. i had a productive day at work & wrote a lot of content for the program i'm administrating, which made me feel better since we were a bit behind on content (we were three months behind, but now we're only less than two months).\n  \n  i ran errands after work & treated myself to an iced coffee, and now i'm listening to studio ghibli piano music while going through my inbox.\n  ","410868":"\n  no, but i do know someone who complains about everything they *can't* do, which is perhaps just as aggravating.\n  ","410869":"\n  i don't remember most of my dreams, so i honestly don't know. sometimes i do remember dreaming about work, and the only reason why i remember them is because i sometimes confuse my dream-work with my real life-work, lmao.\n  ","410870":"\n  my favorite movies are -- sweeney todd, i am not a serial killer, the crow, the number 23, girl interrupted, queen of the damned, american psycho, and the shining.\n  \n  my favorite songs (currently) are -- \"almost (sweet music)\" by hozier, \"apologize\" by grandson, \"beggar's song\" by matt maeson, \"sleeping on the blacktop\" by colter wall, \"bury a friend\" by billie eilish, and \"devil like me\" by rainbow kitten surprise.\n  ","410871":"\n  he's simply not good-looking, in my opinion. it doesn't really go much deeper than that. his looks aren't appealing to my taste, i prefer men with darker hair and features and are a bit older, like robert downey jr. and hugh jackman.\n  \n  i can't really think of anyone else who's attractive to me, besides johnny depp on certain occasions (depending on how his hair is). i also find angelina jolie, natalie portman, and ruby rose to be attractive.\n  ","410872":"\n  practice lots of self-care and spend time looking after your own needs & happiness. it's also helpful to spend time with friends, who will remind you that you're a separate individual away from a relationship and don't necessarily *need* to be involved with someone in order to be happy.\n  ","410873":"\n  how would finding a celebrity make it personal ?? lol. no, i just don't find him attractive.\n  ","410874":"\n  he's conventionally attractive, but i don't look at him and go \"ooh, he's hot!\" or anything, lol.\n  ","410875":"\n  nourishment, shelter, clothing, oxygen, and companionship.\n  ","410876":"\n  i suppose i would be considered an expert in grammar and creative & professional writing, considering i have a bachelor's degree in the subjects. however, there are still things i don't know or remember, and i do have to look things up to remind myself every now and again.\n  ","410877":"\n  no, i don't believe social media will die off -- at least not anytime soon. it's an excellent way to connect with other people from around the globe, share news on current affairs, and educate yourself and others about things. i think the only way social media will be on the decline would be if something else took its place.\n  ","410878":"\n  no, my car doesn't have personalized or specialty plates. i'm not interested in cars or anything, so it doesn't matter to me what my car looks like -- as long as it drives well, it doesn't make a difference.\n  ","410879":"\n  i do watch game of thrones, and i hope either jon snow or daenerys targarean end up on the iron throne, especially considering jon is the rightful heir to the throne.\n  ","410880":"\n  i don't mind doing the laundry or washing the dishes. i find both to be therapeutic, and i especially love the smell of clean laundry because of the products i use on them.\n  ","410881":"\n  i've only seen him in the hunger games movies, but i think he was a good actor in them. i don't remember much about his role, though.\n  ","410882":"\n  i've never tried it before, but it looks delicious.\n  ","410883":"\n  i have a plastic case that's red marble. :'))\n  \n  it kinda looks like this ;\n  ","410884":"\n  when my boyfriend calls me, the fallout 4 theme song begins playing ;\n

within the past few months with my boyfriend's family, which was fun, but overall i don't really like it.\n  ","410886":"\n  yes, i use deodorant every morning (unless i'm in too much of a rush and totally forget, lol). i have old spice deodorant.\n  ","410887":"\n  i was late for work earlier this week, by like 10 minutes. i would have made it on time had there not been massive amounts of traffic on the highway.\n  ","410888":"\n  uh, i normally just say hi ?? nothing unusual or unique.\n  ","410889":"\n  no. your personal choice in makeup isn't generally correlated with the amount of self esteem you have. for a lot of people, makeup is a form of self expression and artistic expression.\n  ","410890":"\n  one of my pet peeves is people who talk over others during a conversation and don't allow the other person to finish talking first. i find it really disrespectful.\n  ","410891":"\n  i don't usually have bad purchases. i don't usually buy things often other than the necessities, and they're things that i know are reliable.\n  ","410892":"\n  yes, but not in the stereotypical way of believing everyone only has one soulmate. i believe that people can have more than one soulmate and it can be in both platonic and romantic relationships.\n  ","410893":"\n  sometimes, they're super comfy.\n  ","410894":"\n  i never said that i *never* experienced harassment. it just hasn't happened recently because i don't go out often, and when i do, i'm not normally around a lot of people.\n  ","410895":"\n  dragonball z and thundercats.\n  ","410896":"\n  interesting !! i've never heard this one before.\n  ","410897":"\n  nope, i've only used paintball and airsoft guns.\n  ","410898":"\n  i used to listen to her music when i was younger, yeah (from the \"born to die\" era). i haven't heard any of her newer music, though.\n  ","410899":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm doing fine. work today wasn't terrible. i also feel productive because i cooked dinner & did a load of laundry as soon as i got home, and now that i'm done showering and getting ready for bed, i can listen to music and relax for a while.\n  ","410900":"\n  evidence came out indicating that amber heard was actually the one who was abusing johnny depp, actually.\n  \n  i don't remember where i read it, but there were court documentations and photos of what she has done to him over the years, and while that was going on, she was apparently the one who tried to change the narrative and insinuate that he was the one hurting her.\n  ","410901":"\n  i find a lot of conspiracy theories interesting, but i don't know if i necessarily believe in them. the whole \"9\/11 was an inside job\" theory is really intriguing to me, and i think that's the theory i align with most.\n  ","410902":"\n  i used to be a night person when i was a teenager, but as i've gotten older, i've slowly transitioned to being a morning person. i've had the same work schedule for the past four years, so i eventually got used to waking up early in the morning. these days, i've been waking up before 8am even on the weekends.\n  ","410903":"\n  yeah, my fridge has an exterior ice maker and water dispenser, so it's filtered automatically.\n  ","410904":"\n  this is assuming we have the financial means to purchase a house, lol. if we did have the financial capability to move out of the country and buy a house, then i would do so in a heartbeat.\n  ","410905":"\n  social interaction, haha. it seems so easy for most other people to traverse their daily lives and have conversations with others, and even make friends with other people, but i've always had a difficult time maintaining social interaction and friendships with others.\n  ","410906":"\n  yes, i enjoy taco bell. i only really order one or two things from there, though (the veggie power bowl and the nacho fries).\n  ","410907":"\n  no, i haven't worked a night shift in four years or so. i only worked nights when i worked in a retail environment.\n  ","410908":"\n  yeah, i was extremely nervous to get my driver's license because driving has always given me a lot of anxiety. however, it was something i *needed* to do, so i had no other option. i took driving lessons twice a week for three months, i believe, before i took my road test.\n  \n  i failed my road test the first time because i panicked and couldn't remember how to parallel park. but the second time, i passed.\n  ","410909":"\n  i've never even heard of that before, let alone tried it. lmao.\n  ","410910":"\n  driven my car while absolutely plastered. not only could i have hurt myself, but i also put other people on the road at risk too.\n  ","410911":"\n  passionfruit-flavored seltzer !! it's by la croix, and it's really yummy.\n  ","410912":"\n  french fries & oreo ice cream.\n  ","410913":"\n  i don't talk about my parents on askfm.\n  ","410914":"\n  yes, i actually love iced tea !! during the summer, i like to make pitchers of it.\n  ","410915":"\n  yeah, it's happened a few times before. it wasn't anything ridiculous or dramatic, though.\n  ","410916":"\n  probably drug possession or public intoxication.\n  ","410917":"\n  everyone, lmao. particular cersei's obsession with elephants, jon snow's dramatic realization, and the reuniting of jaime and bran.\n  ","410918":"\n  i heard \"hostage\" when i was driving home from work this afternoon & liked it a lot.\n  \n  right now, my favorites are -- \"bury a friend,\" \"bad guy,\" and \"bellyache.\"\n  ","410919":"\n  i'm not embarrassed over any of the things i'm skilled in. i don't have any weird talents anyway -- most of what i'm skilled in is creative, i.e. writing, photography, painting.\n  ","410920":"\n  i'm working through my issues with self-control and impulsivity. i came to the conclusion a few weeks ago that i have problems with drinking alcohol, to the point where i was getting black out drunk 3-4 times per week. and on the nights i wasn't getting intoxicated, i was having at least one drink per night because i craved it.\n  \n  since i came to that understanding, i've been trying hard to limit myself and gain more control over my habits. i don't drink regularly anymore, which has been difficult in itself. i'll have one or two drinks here and there, but it isn't nearly as often as what i was doing a month ago, nor am i drinking as much on those nights that i do allow myself to have a drink.\n  \n  i still crave it every day. but it isn't healthy for me, and my boyfriend was getting overwhelmingly concerned for my health and my mental state when i was drinking heavily. i'm trying to be better.\n  ","410921":"\n  i personally don't know. if they were losing revenue, then there would definitely be press and media about it on the internet (which i haven't seen, but i also don't follow the news much anymore).\n  \n  it's the time of year for companies in general to be debuting new products, especially swimwear, so i don't find that unusual.\n  ","410922":"\n  i've never donated money to large charities, but i have contributed to some people's gofundme pages before. i've only ever done it 2-3 times before, though -- i'm usually wary when it comes to people raising money for themselves and i'll only contribute if i know that person is being genuine & if i know them personally, whether it's first-hand or through another friend.\n  ","410923":"\n  i *really* want to see hozier live in concert. his music has always been beautiful to me, and i think he would put on an amazing, awe-inspiring show.\n  ","410924":"\n  yes, companies like victoria's secret do portray the wrong message to vulnerable, insecure children when it comes to their marketing techniques and clothing options. while there's obviously nothing wrong with being thin, the companies give off the impression that a thin body type is the *only* body type that's attractive or alluring -- when that's not true in any form.\n  \n  this is further complicated by their ways of photoshopping models to unrealistic perfection, not selling clothing or intimate apparel that's over a certain size, etc etc. they profit off of young girls' insecurities.\n  ","410925":"\n  i think it's incredibly sad. there are centuries of history within that cathedral, and so many historical pieces will be lost in the flames. however -- it *can* be rebuilt, and it's going to go under intensive reconstruction, hopefully very soon.\n  \n  i read an article the other day regarding notre dame and it's significance, particularly in historical video games like assassin's creed. they're utilizing the blueprints from assassin's creed: unity to recreate the cathedral, because everything in the game was built to scale and with significant detail. it's going to help the constructors and engineers rebuild it up.\n  ","410926":"\n  well ... i'm answering this super late. LOL.\n  \n  it's currently thursday afternoon, and my week has felt ridiculously long. i'm happy tomorrow is my last day of work before the weekend, though. it's been a productive week, but i've been so exhausted every day. i'm looking forward to catching up on much-needed sleep tonight.\n  ","410927":"\n  i feel most alive when i'm out in the middle of nature, whether it's on the beach or in the woods or on the peak of a mountain. sometimes i prefer to be there alone, but other times it helps when i have one or two friends with me, where we can appreciate the beauty of nature together.\n  ","410928":"\n  yes !! i've watched a few of shane dawson's conspiracy theory videos -- they're pretty interesting. here's his first conspiracy theory compilation video, it's about 75 minutes long ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BHLBaOASC74&t=6s\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","410929":"\n  for me, paradise is any moment i can spend with my boyfriend uninterrupted, where we can both sit back and relax with no real responsibilities or worries.\n  \n  last night was sorta like a \"paradise\" moment for us. he had off from work yesterday, so i went to his house when i get out of work and we set up a huge, roaring campfire in his backyard and burned it until 10pm. afterwards, we went out to eat since we both didn't really eat dinner. it was a really nice night.\n  ","410930":"\n  quite often, actually. i don't normally have an appetite.\n  ","410931":"\n  LOL. i'm not that bad when it comes to taking photos of food, but i do have a tendency to do it when it comes to burrito bowls and sushi, for some reason.\n  ","410932":"\n  LOL. i don't really know why i feel compelled to do it -- it just looked so good, and i wanted to commemorate that moment.\n  ","410933":"\n  my chipotle lunch order from last friday, lol.\n  ","410934":"\n  it depends entirely on the individual. some people who have cheated in the past vow to remain faithful to their partner after marriage, whether that's due to loyalty or faith or tradition or something as simple as growing older and maturing. however, other people may want to marry their partner to ensure that they won't leave them if they continue cheating, and it has nothing to do with loyalty or maturity at all.\n  \n  marriage isn't an end-all, and they can be annulled. it doesn't always mean that a person is ready to stop cheating if they offer marriage. it could simply mean another method of manipulation.\n  ","410935":"\n  i *always* value my privacy, so i try to get as much of it as i possibly can. occasionally i do want to see a friend or two, but most of the time i'm perfectly content with being alone.\n  ","410936":"\n  no, i've never used the shoutout feature before. i don't exactly want to know if anyone is nearby, lmao.\n  \n  although i do believe the algorithm is a bit wonky, because i've received shoutouts from people who live in entirely different countries from me.\n  ","410937":"\n  i wouldn't know what to do if they were caught dealing drugs or robbery, so i would personally hand the situation off to or consult my partner. he has more experience with more troubling situations like that than i do, and he would know the correct means of approaching the situation and disciplining the child.\n  ","410938":"\n  ???\n  \n  change is something inevitable and it occurs naturally as one gets older. if changing means that i'm becoming more like \"myself\" (whatever that may be) and not willing to endure bullsh*t or herd mentality anymore, then i welcome change with open arms.\n  \n  i apologize if i've ever been mean or hurtful to you, but i'm not generally a mean person. if i have to resort to using unkind words, then something is definitely wrong with the situation because that's a rarity for me.\n  ","410939":"\n  no, i was goth when i was in middle school though. when i was in high school, i was mostly scene or emo, depending on the day, LOL.\n  ","410940":"\n  it depends on why they got arrested in the first place, whether or not the arrest was warranted, etc etc. if my child was absolutely in the wrong, then i would definitely be very angry.\n  \n  i would hope that i would be a resourceful, open, and loving parent to where such an event would be rare, though. however, i also know that kids will sometimes act out in rebellion regardless of how they were raised because that's how some kids, particularly teenagers, are.\n  ","410941":"\n  nah, i never went to juvie. i probably knew kids that did go to juvie, but i don't remember any of them now considering how long ago that would have been.\n  ","410942":"\n  you guys are making me hUNGRY.\n  ","410943":"\n  as long as there are no pineapples, i'll try it. LOL.\n  ","410944":"\n  aah, i'll have to look into it !! thank you ~~\n  \n  i've always wanted to try a cheese-less, or at least a healthier alternative, pizza, especially since my lactose issues have been acting up again. it's honestly terrifying when my job orders pizza some fridays and i have to play roulette over whether or not my body decides it can handle cheese that day.\n  ","410945":"\n  the only person i desire to kiss is my boyfriend.\n  ","410946":"\n  my partner and i are *very* comfortable with each other, lol. when you've been dating someone for as long as i have, then nothing is off limits really. i've frequently told him that he smelled and suggested that he take a shower, and he's done the same thing to me as well. it isn't offensive to me at all.\n  ","410947":"\n  yes, i watched it last night. it was fairly anticlimactic, but i also recognize that it was mainly an introduction episode to re-introduce characters and establish their settings for the remainder of the season (with a few curve balls here and there).\n  \n  i have to say, though ... the memes coming out of this episode are GOLDEN. lmao.\n  ","410948":"\n  two fried eggs, bacon & cheddar cheese on a toasted croissant with hash browns and an extra large iced coffee.\n  ","410949":"\n  i'm drinking a blue raspberry-flavored sparkling water that's infused with vitamins & caffeine.\n  ","410950":"\n  i actually just discussed this in my last answer before i saw this question, rofl.\n  \n  in summary, i do neither. if pizza is an option, then i either avoid it entirely or i suffer through the cheesy goodness. it also depends on how i'm feeling that day, because some days my body is more able to handle dairy than others. it's weird.\n  ","410951":"\n  this is a similar answer to my previous response, but yes -- i do like pizza. however, because of some of the ingredients on pizza, pizza does not like me in return, lol (unless i get a cheese-less pizza).\n  ","410952":"\n  i like cheese, but cheese does not like me, LOL. i've been having terrible indigestion problems with most types of dairy, especially when it comes to cheese. i've been avoiding it.\n  ","410953":"\n  i don't discuss my finances on the internet. regardless, i get paid hourly so it entirely depends on how many hours i work that particular day.\n  ","410954":"\n  i'm sure i have at some point in my life. these days, i prefer dark wash jeans.\n  ","410955":"\n  when i was a child, i got tested and my IQ was somewhere within the 115-120 range (i don't remember the exact number).\n  \n  i'm sure it's much lower now, though. my intelligence has greatly dwindled over the past 5-10 years.\n  ","410956":"\n  i like a few of her songs, yeah !! i only recently discovered her music, like within the past 3-4 days.\n  ","410957":"\n  i already gave my opinions regarding her behavior yesterday. to comment upon anything further would be a waste of time, and quite frankly to reflect on anything else she's saying at this point would be giving her undeserved attention.\n  \n  if anything else gets sent to me about what's been occurring over the past 2-3 days, it'll get deleted. i already posted my thoughts and i'm not repeating myself.\n  ","410958":"\n  thanks, i appreciate it ~~\n  "}}
