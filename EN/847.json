year then you will know what i m talking about . and no one was prepared for that lol . amazing ! to be honest and she even put one of the first songs they wrote before they blew up on youtube , delaney in the mix . and i think the reason why lauren isnt posting all the videos yet is because there s a few main cimfam members who were there that recorded and she s waiting for the better angle and audio . no offense to the person who posted that but lottts of screaming and singing arielle","783508":"no one is certain if dani will put her own album out . as she said she was going to make an ep once then totally privated , deleted some of the songs she made . but if you are a member of the girls on patreon then you ll know the girls put exclusive content up for only those members to see . and she has posted a lot of her original songs lately . youtube got a few on there as well by her just we got to wait and see what the future has planned for each and everyone of us . meanwhile enjoy what is going on currently arielle","783509":"then you would have to wait till the girls tour the uk again . i m so sorry ! arielle","783510":"hello arielle","783511":"thats girls watching the sound check are those who have platinum vip tickets for being a oart of the believe in you your street teams . which is promoting the tour and completing the tasks which they were given by with myself or the girls . you have to live within an hour of the city in order to participate and message me and the girls via the street team page to receive the tasks and be apart of the team . the street team for boston and hamden were already made and you can no longer be apart of the team for these cities as of right now . maybe if we do again in the future . but however there is still time to join the other teams arielle","783512":"the girls all went out and explored connecticut last night . mostly new haven . arielle","783513":"concert is tonight and the meet and greet is before and after the show

which lasted for like what weeks ? now poor cody is dealing with her antics","783536":"anyone else act loopy though ?","783537":"i think she is alright , all of us girls end up getting pretty emotional when we have to perform because the songs are relatable , super personal and we put all our emotions into these songs and when one of us starts to cry its like a chain reaction . even if its a fan . . . so i think that might be the reason why or maybe something she s dealing with at the time which i will check into . . . but thank you for looking out for us","783538":"https mobile .

feel her decision to not seek medical help lead to the lost of the child and for someone to say they didn t even want it in the first place is just sad","784168":"when the oldest child , michael , was young , lynne saw a tv show interview about homeschooling . in it , a year old girl spoke about attending college and excelling . lynne was intrigued , but also a bit wary about homeschooling it was the early s and homeschooling wasn t very common . however , she did not enjoy her school experience due to a combination of bullying and skipping a few grades . she was ahead of her classmates and had memories of sitting in class , staring out the window , waiting for the lesson to be over . she wanted her kids to be able to go at their own pace , even skipping several grades if that was what was right for them . she shared her thoughts about homeschooling with her husband and he was on board . they decided to homeschool all of the kids from kindergarten through th grade . she developed her own curriculum based on classic literature , latin and greek , the catholic faith , and critical thinking . she wanted her kids to learn to think for themselves , to be curious and love learning , and to have strong moral compasses . lynne had heard of other families who homeschooled out of fear of the world and wanted to isolate kids from that , and she did not want her kids to be isolated . and so , she signed them up for every activity possible in their area swim team , musical theatre , basketball , gymnastics , boy scouts and girl scouts , karate , and many more . her kids grew up to be a loud , vibrant bunch . they were very well socialized and had a lot of friends . most people didn t guess they were homeschooled when they met them because of their social and people skills . to this day , the cimorelli s count their homeschool experience as one of the greatest tools in their lives and careers . because of homeschooling , they had a lot of free time to learn instruments , practice singing and harmonizing , and write songs . homeschooling gave them the space to be free to be themselves . being unique and independent was highly valued in the cimorelli household they were not told to fit into the mold . this ideal shaped their music and decisions for years to come . to be continued more on the early days of cimorelli coming next week !","784169":"we have originals and

started going on a walk every morning and praying the rosary by listening to it on this rosary app i have while i walk . changes my morning so much , brings so much more peace and clarity to my day ! ? ? . i started drinking a gallon of water oz everyday which is keeping me so hydrated which makes me feel better physically and also is making my skin look so good ? ? ? . i read this page book at pages a day called searching for and maintaining peace and it changed the way i view god , myself , the people around me , my goals , literally everything . if you are seeking a deeper relationship with god , this is a must read ! ! every time i think i can figure everything out on my own , i always find out the hard way that the best choice for everyone involved is just to rely solely on him . trying my best to do that . how was your week ? comment and tell me","784276":"just not consistant with it and no one really uses it anymore","784277":"if youre only with that person just because they

inside that actually matters ! ! !","784278":"definitely not . i want my future daughter to know she s always beautiful even if she may not see that herself , others say different or she feels there s prettier girls out there . i want her to know she will be loved for who she is on the inside not the outside . that tv shows and magazines are not reality and are made out to just try to turn you into something you will never be just so they can make a profit . i want her to be confident , bold , caring and so much more . and not turn into some girl that is stuck up , has to have name brand everything and the most expensive things . i want her to live a simple but comfortable , happy life and get to experience the world . the show like toddlers and tiara basically make up tons if drama between the children and the parents . they spend thousands of dollars on just one outfit the child will most likely only wear once and never again . flippers to have the most perfect smile when there could be absolutely nothing wrong with it . and tons of makeup that makes them look like a life sized baby doll , which completely takes away their actual characteristics and transforms them into awhole other person . which why do we all want our children to look the same ? and i literally seen a child get starved on an episode because her mother didn t want her to gain any weight because she had to maintain a certain body image no thanks .","784279":"awe","784280":"no i do not sorry","784281":"hope you re having a great time","784282":"bc i don t want to","784283":"sure","784284":"awe
