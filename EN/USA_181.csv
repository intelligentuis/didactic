  I feel there’s a stigma when it comes to being the first one to say I love you in a relationship because I feel people always  assume it has to be the guy who says ‘ I love you’ first rather then the girl. That’s how our generation is but that’s not true at all. The girl can be the first one to say it.

  That’s okay, it’s understandable to feel anxious when trying to get closer to someone physically.

   Do you think it's acceptable for companies to allocate their workers holiday dates if they haven't booked them by a certain date, esp when employees might be intentionally trying to save weeks for when they get told they have to self isolate because of Covid_19 and don't want to lose pay? 💁‍♂️😳

  That you might have an unhealthy power dynamic in the relationship. It’s important to have a balance of power meaning that one person shouldn’t have total control of the relationship or call all the shots. Both of you should be able to contribute thoughts, opinions and feeling equally.

   What is more important - to be loved or to fall in love?

  I feel both are really important. It’s important to feel that you’re loved because that makes you feel motivated and happy inside and outside knowing that someone loves you. And it keeps you feeling alive and energized in life. And it’s also important to fall in love because I feel you should definitely experience that in your life time at least once even though sometimes it could be painful or amazing it’s definitely worth it.

  You realize you’ve found the right one when they treat you the way you deserve to be treated and when they see a future with you and actually want a future with you, talking about getting married to you or spending their lives with you, the way they give their everything into the relationship, putting all their effort into it, making you constantly happy, always wanting to spend time with you, giving you butterflies, you enjoy their presence, they make you laugh etc!

   That is absolutely true, it is the only way we eradicated smallpox, polio and measles. Vaccine hesitancy is dangerous. I know a lady who didn't get the flu shot, and she was babysitting a child before she knew she was sick, and the child died all because she couldn't be bothers to get the flu shot

  ","
  Yes of course mental health is a thing anon. Look someone may seem happy on the outside when they’re really suffering on the inside but you would never know because they don’t display it.  Just because someone is rich doesn’t mean anything. They could still be depressed and battling with demons inside of them. Chester was battling with demons that took over him and sadly he took his precious life but he will never be forgotten.

   Why do people give up so easily on relationships nowadays? Are we becoming more and more selfish?
  ","
  I believe people give up on relationships nowadays so easily because they can’t commit and because they don’t know how to be loyal to their partners. Maybe they just aren’t ready to commit and be loyal.  I think it’s mainly because people are scared of commitment and committing to one person. I’ve noticed nowadays people don’t take relationships seriously and just aren’t committed at all. It’s quite sad actually.

Overtime that love you had for that person will fade away because it just didn’t work out no matter how hard you tried or how much effort you put in the relationship with that person. I feel it only fades when you feel that person was playing you or not putting in any effort into the relationship like you were.

   if you love someone, why would you let them go? 🤔🔗💕
  ","
  I mean you could definitely love someone but not be right for each other. Like the two of you aren’t meant to be in a relationship together no matter how hard you try for it over and over again. You know? Maybe that person just came into your life to teach you a lesson and not to stay in your life. There’s a saying that goes “ if you love someone, let them go”. “If they come back to you, they were really yours, but if they don’t come back, they were never actually yours”.  I feel that the idea of letting go of someone is just to prove that if it’s meant to be, it will come back to you. It’s really just a way to set yourself free from that pull or that hold you have on that person. Letting go shows tremendous strength and love.

  so much because he truly makes me so happy every single day and I know I’m such a pain to deal with sometimes but he is able to deal with that because he loves me.  He loves me for who I am and he never asks me to change for anything. He’s so supportive and just always wants the best for me and that’s because he cares. He has such a big heart truly and it’s so amazing that I’m able to feel his love every single day. I’ve said it before many times but he is one of a kind and so special to me there is no doubt about that.  I’m very thankful for him and I couldn’t be more happier with him. 🥺🥰 I love him very much for so many reasons. He’s made me the happiest I’ve ever felt honestly and it’s so magical. So I just want to thank him for giving me all of his love and his everything.

Or doing adventurous things and having fun. Making yourself happy. And existing is just like yeah you’re living and breathing oxygen in order to exist but are you really living? You can just exist and not be really living.
