Before we started the Rooters, when I was first starting to think about the concept, I had the thought that we could kick off the arc by having Aggregor seek out Kevin. Aggregor's genetic material was to be breaking down, coming undone, he was degrading to a point that it was difficult for him to hold his human form. So he would go to Kevin for help, ultimately disclosing to Kevin that Ag was a Rooter experiment to duplicate Kevin's powers. Perhaps Ag's mind was wiped as well. The episode likely would have ended with Ag melting into ooze (dead?) and Kevin would have ended up pretty much where he did at the end of the first Rooters episode.\n  \n  I don't remember why we didn't go that way, I think maybe no one could work up any enthusiasm to do an Aggregor story. As a large part of the crew had worked on Ag's UA story arc, I don't think anyone was in any hurry to get back to him.\n  \n  One other thing that didn't get left out, but it did get kind of confused was the Prototech Armor. My original intention was that, unknown to Rook, he had been field testing this new prototype Prototech Armor FOR The Rooters. The Rooters would have been wearing the Armor because of Rook's successful testing of it for them. I can't really remember why this didn't get fixed either. Probably either it was too late, or no one cared enough to change it.\n  \n  Here's a little list of original ideas for the Rooters I put down on my phone so I wouldn't forget. The second name on the list was supposed to be the African American Plumber with the visor from the flashbacks. I'm blurring it out in case we want to save it for something else.\n  ","279679":"\n  Well, he's not a B.L.R.R.T.\n  ","279680":"\n  You mean Jerry?

Both have really amazing (and wildly vividly different) color skills, and both are also great TF artists in their own right as well.

We walked down the dirt road a little ways until we came to just another ancient looking building. But inside was a palace of wonder! The place was so packed full of toys, there was stuff hanging from the ceiling. They had every Japanese Transformer ever made. And Battle Beasts, and Micronauts, and any Takara toy you can think of.
