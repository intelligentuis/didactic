I remember that exact day. I was sleeping and then I woke up and when I wake up I always check my phone and I have the news notifications on and the first thing I saw was that he committed suicide. And at that moment I started freaking out and telling myself no no no no this can\u2019t be real. They\u2019re just lying to people. This isn\u2019t real. I was in complete denial because I couldn\u2019t believe what I just saw. But then more people started posting it and that\u2019s when my heart dropped and a piece of me died. I remember feeling so lost and heart broken. Completely devastated and a loss for words. I was shaken to the core. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I honestly couldn\u2019t. Broke my heart to know how much pain he was in really and you know what really tears me apart is that we could feel is pain through his music and if you listened carefully to the lyrics in his songs you would be able to feel his pain and misery that he was in but yet no one helped him\ud83d\udc94 and knowing that just breaks me and shreds me to pieces. A piece of me has died with him. I\u2019m not whole anymore my other half is along side him. It\u2019s going to be 3 years this year in July without him and I can\u2019t even begin to think about that. When that day comes man I\u2019m going to feel lost and heart broken just like I did last year when it was 2 years without him but then I remember and know that he wouldn\u2019t want us to be in depression or to be sad. He would much rather want us to be celebrating his life always and sharing his music all over the world to keep his legacy alive forever. And I could see it happening and knowing that Chester\u2019s legacy will be lived on forever warms my heart and makes me so very happy. He deserves that much for us to keep his beautiful angelic legacy alive forever and ever. \ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc95 miss you Chester so much.\n  ","985266":"\n  of course, that\u2019s my man\ud83e\udd70\n  ","985267":"\n  oh no, don\u2019t worry about it.
