Because you need to. If you\u2019re being controlled and have limited access to money, make sure the money you do get you save it and hide it away. While you\u2019re saving up this money, mentally plan what you\u2019re going to take with you, I suggest a backpack worth of ONLY essentials. You can get your other stuff later with a police officer or someone you trust. Also make sure the timing is right to leave, if they lock you inside when they leave, make sure they are FULLY GONE from the house and break a window to get out. If you have zero access to money, as soon as you find a way to leave, go to a trusted person\u2019s place... if you are isolated and don\u2019t know anyone, the police is going to be your best bet even though I\u2019m a little iffy with them (bad experiences). While you\u2019re planning your escape, don\u2019t act suspicious, that\u2019s probably the number one way to have your plan ruined. If you have money but don\u2019t want to go to the cops yet or at all, make sure you have enough money for a ticket of some kind if you know no one in your town\/city and get the hell out of there.
