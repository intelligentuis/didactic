   Would you rather lose all of your money and valuables or all of the pictures you have ever taken?
  ","
  i'd rather lose all of my money. you can always make more money, but the memories that go alongside photos can't be replaced. i've always relied heavily on photographs to remind me of good memories, because often i can't remember incidents alone.
  
  i have at least three or four photo albums full of photos from the past few years.

  not generally. i work my best when i know i don't have a *strict* deadline, but i can work at my own pace (which is fast anyway).

  i *think* i played spyro when i was younger, but i honestly can't remember because that's way too long ago for me to even recall. i have memories of playing crash bandicoot, so i assume i played spyro as well.
  
  i think the remastered version is a brilliant idea, though. not only does it bring back nostalgia for adults who played the game on the original console, but it also introduces the game to a brand new audience who will be experiencing it for the first time.

  i enjoy hanging out with my boyfriend the most. he makes me feel the most comfortable, as well as the safest, and we never run out of things to talk about when we're together. even something as simple as sitting down and watching a youtube video together is entertaining because it'll usually bring forth random discussions that lead into deeper things.

   What do you think is wrong in the world right now?
  ","
  this is an incredibly open-ended question, and it would be impossible for me to list everything that's wrong in the world at the moment.
  
  climate change has been wrecking havoc on the earth. so little people are being brought to justice for crimes they've committed. the media has brainwashed most people into focusing on insignificant events while ignoring larger events. social media has taken over people's lives to the point where everyone feels entitled. there's rampant ableism in today's society when it comes to physical & mental disabilities, and a lot of it is so ingrained in our culture that most people aren't even aware it exists.
  "

   Does the world have a good future?
  ","
  i'm 50-50 on this -- on the one hand, i see a lot of progression in terms of science and technology. however, in terms of social reform, i feel as if the world (or, at the very least, the united states) has halted.
  
  the midterm elections have given me a little bit of more hope, but other than that, i'm fairly neutral about the future. it could go either way.
  "

  i've always owned android phones, & i can't imagine owning an iphone because it would be too different from what i'm used to.
  
  however, i do have an ipad and it helped me a lot when i was in college when it came to assignments and writing.

  this used to happen to me a lot when i went out more and worked with the general public. while i was working in retail, i would sometimes have customers hitting on me and saying gross things to me, and sometimes it got to the point where i would have to tell them to leave the store.
  
  in a casual setting, i've also had people come up to me and try to flirt with me, but i usually just tell them straight out that their efforts are futile and i'm not interested.
  "
418466,"
   When you argue do you need to cool off or you just talk like nothing happened within seconds?
  ","
  neither. when i argue with someone (although that's seldom), i try to talk through the situation as much as possible to come to a mutual understanding or agreement so that the situation can be resolved. i don't really need time to ""cool off,"" but i also don't pretend nothing happened either. it's better to acknowledge the situation and do what you need to do to work through it.

418570,"
   ""as society and language changed, it now refers to a person's gender"" This statement is incorrect and illogical. I just proved to you (using the birth example) that pronouns refer to sex.

  ","
  i don't think you're understanding what i'm saying at all, even though i've repeated myself multiple times. i'm not going to repeat myself, due in part to clogging up my followers' feeds with the same messages over & over again.
  
  i agreed with you when you used the birth example ... because being cisgender is the default. babies have no concept of gender. that's why pronouns are used for sex in the beginning of a person's life up until they discover they're trans or non-binary. in the past, trans people weren't respected and their pronouns referred solely to their sex. however, as society changes, so does language. it's accepted that pronouns refer to gender.
  "
418571,"

  i did, and it doesn't affect my life at all. unless she was personally attacking me or disrespecting me/my pronouns, then i don't really see the big deal. however, we have a mutual understanding that we have a difference in opinions, and while we may not agree on everything, we respect one another.

  i've never been sassy, i've simply just corrected them. it's easy to assume i'm cisgender, and i totally understand that.
  
  even if i was sassy in the past, it's normal for a person to change their attitude as they get older. you begin to focus less on the small, insignificant details because they're not a big deal anymore.
  "
418573,"
   Wow. Your story changed BTW, first you said pronouns referred to gender not sex, and then you changed your story to say ""society changed"". It did ""change"" in that some people decided pronouns should refer to gender instead of sex. It never did and doesn't make sense, but if you don't get logic...
  ","
  i don't really understand this message because you reiterated exactly what i said. my story didn't change because i consistently explained that pronouns *used* to refer to sex, and as society and language changed, it now refers to a person's gender.
  
  perhaps you're confused because of the fact that i stated that cisgender is the default. it's perfectly normal to refer to someone as the pronouns that align with their sex before they discover if they're trans or non-binary. at which point, pronouns change. you're not going to continue to refer to a trans man as she/her when they come out and say their pronouns are he/him.
  "
418574,"
   Do your friends refer to you as she or them in real life?
  ","
  both, actually. i'm not bothered with being called she/her because i present as feminine sometimes and my face is naturally feminine-looking, so i wouldn't expect people to automatically know my gender.
  "
418575,"
   omg, i knew someone would try it lmao ? just to clarify, like i said before i will always respect everyone's pronouns regardless of my own personal thoughts and feelings about it, and obviously i respect and like you a lot as an individual and would never go out of my way to be disrespectful. ☺️
  ","
  lmaoo, it was bound to happen. people love arguing with me over sex and gender.
  
  thank you, though. even though we have different opinions, i value that you put your opinions across respectfully and understand people's feelings. it's rare to see these days because often people resort to personal attacks.
  "
418576,"
   Again...that's not how logic works. 1 + 1 = 2, the earth goes around the sun. and there is no subjective interpretation or power play involved in that. Our world has real facts, and real truths, and if you don't naturally buy into that then we have problems a lot more serious than pronouns.
  ","
  you underestimate the beliefs of other people then, lol. there are so many people who try to defy logic and use it to put force their own personal agenda, that's something that has never changed.
  
  either way, that doesn't change the fact that language changes as society changes; therefore, while pronouns used to refer solely to people's sex in the past, they now refer to a person's gender. being cisgender is a default up until a person comes to the discovery that they're trans or non-binary, at which point their pronouns can change depending upon what they're most comfortable using.
  "
418577,"
   ""logic is can be subjective."" No, that's not how logic works. 1 + 1 = 2, it will never ""subjectively"" be 1 + 1 = 3.
  ","
  it's based upon people's interpretations of that logic as well. most forms of logic are objective, but there are some instances where it is subjective or people skew logic to suit their own personal agenda.
  "
418578,"
   BTW that was a trick question, because science and studies have nothing to do with it. It's about history and logic. History: most societies have had different and changing ideas about gender. Logic: pronouns refer to sex, not gender. Sex is universal, gender is not. And no society hasn't changed.
  ","
  ???
  
  studies have everything to do with it because they're based upon years of research and study. history is constantly changing, and logic is can be subjective. it's a basic, universally-accepted concept that language changes as society changes.
  "
418579,"
   What did the studies actually say? Can you name one off the top of your mind without googling?
  ","
  you're asking me to go back 5+ years, man. i can't recite the source at this point.
  
  however, they all generally agreed that pronouns were a default for sex up until a trans person came out with their gender, at which point their pronouns changed. it also delved into the history behind the distinction of sex and gender, much like what you're saying, but as society changes, so does the language we use.
  "
418580,"
   How many of those studies have you read?
  ","
  quite a few, from what i remember. i researched it when i was in college, so that was quite a few years ago.
  "
418581,"
   Well, gender actually doesn't come up at all, because it's not about gender. Gender is like clothing, it changes from place to place, and it changes across time. Nobody has bothered to come up with terms for it because it's realized that a man is a man, regardless of his gender. That's history.
  ","
  there have been dozens of studies on gender since then. while what you're saying is indeed true in the past, science has progressed since those studies were published. also, gender does change definition from culture to culture, but it still exists in most cultures.
  "
418582,"
   People in real life or online?
  ","
  i was referring to people in real life. i only have a few online friends whom i care about in that matter.
  "
418583,"
   lmao but online sources when credible are accepted in like every citation format...if it wasn't ""real research"" why is it academically accepted?
  ","
  i agree. people seldom check books out at the library anymore, and colleges give students a plethora of online resources to do their research because it's likely more up-to-date and accurate anyway.
  "
418584,"
   do you think you will grow out of this phase? following trends???
  ","
  are you referring to me being non-binary as a trend ??
  
  that's a pretty long trend then, i've been this way for years. i've only started being open about my gender quite recently.
  "
418585,"
   Yes, but I'm 102% sure your sources, whatever they were, weren't based on actual history. I know the actual history. And here's a simple logical exercise: when a doctor or midwife delivers a baby, and they slap his ass and say ""it's a boy!"" how are they making the call that it's a boy?
  ","
  everyone's gender aligns with their sex when they're first born because babies have no concept of gender. cisgender is the default in our society. there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever.
  "
418586,"
   How hard is it for you to cut someone out from your life?
  ","
  it's always been relatively easy for me to do something like that. in order for me to cut someone from my life entirely, they would have had to do something that really disrespected me to the point where being friends with them is toxic. at that point, i've lost all connection to them.
  "
418587,"
   Are you a forgiving person?
  ","
  it depends on the transgression and whether or not it was done accidentally or purposely. i can forgive accidents as long as they're not repeated multiple times, but i'm less likely to forgive things done on purpose.
  "
418588,"
   Ahh, online sources. There's your problem. That's not research.

  of course it is ?? when i was in college, all of the resources they gave us were accessed online. clinical studies, the national institutes of health, world health organization, etc etc.

  "
418592,"
   How many friends do you have?
  ","
  i have more acquaintances than friends, so perhaps ""friend"" wasn't the accurate term to use in that context, and i have a lot of former friends from whom i've distanced (not for any bad reason, that's just what happens in life).
  
  i can name perhaps five people who are a genuine, close friend of mine.
  "
418593,"
   Do you easily open up to people? If not how long does it take?
  ","
  it's amusing because i'm either incredibly closed off or i'm an open book. it depends entirely on the vibe i get from the person upon meeting them or getting to know them over time.
  
  i used to be closed off all the time, but i've learned that communication is essential to maintaining healthy relationships and i need to be open about my feelings in order to really progress.
  "
418594,"
   no they said this in a public group
  ","
  that wouldn't really change things. i'm only part of one facebook group, and i don't really interact with it regularly. sometimes i'll make my own posts regarding things going on in my life since it's sorta like a vent group, but i steer clear of things that can make people get heated.
  "
418595,"
   What irrational fears do you have? ex. mirrors, basement etc
  ","

   Regardless of how you feel about gender, the concept of pronouns refers to sex, not gender. If you care about education then you can educate yourself about the history of the concept. You may wish to find some other way of asserting the social idea you call non-binary.
  ","
  pronouns perhaps used to solely refer to an individual's sex, but as times have changed, language has adapted to follow suit. pronouns primarily refer to a person's gender now because it refers to how that person feels and presents themselves, and using their biological sex to refer to them (in terms of pronouns) despite them being trans or non-binary is a bit disrespectful.
  
  i've traversed the whole ""gender"" thing for a really long time before i felt that non-binary was the best way to describe me. granted, it is just a label, but it is the easiest way for me to describe my gender because i'm not a trans man or woman and i'm not genderfluid.
  "
418616,"
   I don't understand this nonbinary nonsense. There are two genders: woman and man. Trans women are women. Trans men are men. I've never heard a trans person say ""I'm a non binary, please use neutral pronouns"".
  ","
  consider me the first non-binary person you've come across then. there are plenty of people who are non-binary in the lgbt community.

   why do you make such a big deal to make a distinction between sex and gender? most people dont go through these mental gymantics when referring to someone. i guarantee that even the people who refer to you as ""they/them"" still think of you as ""she/her"" in their mind.
  ","
  it's important because many people neglect to see the difference between sex and gender, and i'm here to educate them on that difference.
  
  guaranteed some people probably still think of me as a woman even though i'm quite open about being non-binary, but what it comes down to is what they say when talking to me and/or about me. if someone misgenders me in conversation purposely, then that isn't respectful anymore.
  "
418646,"
   And this is where you're confused. If you look back across time and across cultures, there have often been people who don't ""fit"" the cultural stereotypes for a certain gender. But they're still considered male or female, because they are genetically male or female. Look it up.
  ","
  there's a distinct difference between sex and gender. i'm not denying that i'm female, because that's my sex. however, my gender doesn't align with my sex which is why my pronouns are they/them (it's what i'm most comfortable with).
  
  there are also people whose gender don't align with their sex and they have other pronouns, some non-binary people use he/him and she/her. it doesn't make their gender any less ""real,"" it's simply what they're most comfortable using.
  "
418647,"
   I respect your gender, sure, but again, the pronouns refer to your sex, not your gender. In your case, the words refer to your sex, which is female.
  ","
  pronouns refer to someone's gender, not their sex. if someone says their pronouns are they/them, then refer to them as they/them.
  
  obviously you don't respect my gender because you just called me a woman, even though i clearly told you my gender multiple times.
  "
418648,"
   So Leigh is a WOMAN. SHE is a woman. You can refer to HER as a WOMAN, even though SHE identifies with a purely social construct of non-binarism.
  ","
  you're confusing sex and gender. my sex is female, but my gender is non-binary (not man or woman). my pronouns are they/them, not she/her.
  
  now that that's on the table, respect would be appreciated. it takes zero effort to respect someone's gender.

  honestly, i was afraid for when they first became pregnant, knowing their activities (drinking and drugs) and how far along they were in the pregnancy already. i hoped that they would clean up their act immediately in light of their baby.
  
  lately, i've been disappointed and afraid in light of recent events. a child failing to thrive is extremely concerning, and the negligence on their part to rectify their behavior just has me shaking my head. i can only hope that this past week has brought light to their eyes and helped them realize that they should be doing more for their child.

  beauty standards (for women) initially existed because everything was done to please men -- a woman was not worth anything if she wasn't valuable to a man, so the concept of beauty was encouraged in an effort to make women more desirable to men.

  people are always looking for acceptance and validation, particularly if they grew up not having either of those things. by stating an opinion that isn't popular with others, you're at risk of being outcasted by the group with which you're affiliated.
  
  this is seen especially on social media, i.e. askfm, where people tend to flock together with like-minded individuals. i'd like to think the overall site is better now that everyone has matured, but years ago, if you voiced an opinion that was outside of what the ""group"" believed, then you would get harassed.

  no, it's something i've pondered for years and have ultimately come to my own conclusions. i used to take religion classes when i was a child, up until i realized i didn't believe in god.
  
  since then, i've researched other religions and have found the trend that people believe in whichever god they believe in due to their faith. i don't have faith.

  if it causes an issue in your relationship, then yeah, that seems pretty significant.
  
  if you know that he isn't entirely wrong, then you ideally should *try* to have a more open mind. however, at the same time, it also matters how he goes about giving you lectures. if he makes you feel bad or upset then that's a talk you two need to have to be more receptive to each other's feelings.
  "
419162,"

  stfu. cashiers are human beings too and they're trying their best to attend to every customer in a timely fashion. it isn't their fault if a customer has a lot of items, or a lot of coupons, or if they're sometimes dealing with a difficult or irate customer. have some patience and realize that they're doing the best they can.

   You have never been a boy nor  have ever been a girl? Elaborate

  there's not much to elaborate on. i've never felt like a girl nor have i ever felt like a boy. my gender doesn't match my physical appearance, and i constantly experience body dysphoria as a result. i've always strived to be androgynous, looking like neither a full boy or a full girl but somewhere in between.

   What's the difference between gender fluid and non binary?
  ","
  genderfluid basically means your gender changes -- some days you're more comfortable referring yourself and presenting as a girl, while other days you're more comfortable presenting as a boy or somewhere in between.
  
  non-binary simply means you're not one of the gender binaries, boy or girl. for me personally, i consider myself to be neither because i've never been a girl nor have i ever been a boy.
  "
419288,"
   why did you have body dysphoria as a child? is it because you looked like a girl? you still look like a girl now.
  ","
  yeah, it was because i developed early when it came to sex characteristics.
  
  unfortunately, i do still look feminine in some cases, which is why i still experience body dysphoria. ideally, i would like to be androgynous.
  "
419289,"
   you are actually technically wrong, some people are genderfluid and change what gender they are periodically.
  ","
  that has nothing to do with what i'm currently talking about. i used to identify as genderfluid until i discovered what non-binary meant.
  "
419290,"
   are you so insecure that you fear reading something will change your gender? im not trying to ""change"" your gender, just wanted to inform you of a term you might not know about.
  ","
  i'm not insecure at all. you just have a blatantly obvious agenda to ridicule or discredit trans & non-binary people, and i never understood the point of that because people will be their gender regardless of what the opposition believes.
  "
419291,"
   Actually ""tomboy"" is a term that's more associated with masculine women or women who like things associated more with men like football, beer, pool etc. So you're not at all a tomboy because you'd have to be a woman.
  ","
  exactly. ^^
  
  even when i was a child, i never considered myself to be a girl because of the horrible body dysphoria i experienced. i still experience it to a degree, but it's moreso something i deal with than anything else.
  "
419292,"
   google the term tomboy and you'll read the very description given by non-binary females.
  ","
  i know what a tomboy is. i just don't really see why you're wasting your time posting this because it doesn't change my gender.
  "
419293,"
   before social media and tumblr, there was a better term for non-binary females, it was ""tomboy"".
  ","
  i don't really know what you're trying to achieve here, but regardless, i'm still non-binary contrary to your views.
  "
419294,"
   when you ""came out"" as non-binary i bet everyone was confused af and didnt even know what you meant.

  there were probably a few people, but i explained it pretty thoroughly so that there was little room for confusion.

  "
419296,"
   Is it a red flag if someone tries to change aspect of their partner’s  personality?
  ","
  yeah, to a certain degree. if a person has toxic traits then it's acceptable to let that person know what they're doing wrong so they can change, but if your partner is trying to change aspects of your personality that aren't problematic, then that may be a red flag.

  my boyfriend is going to find a way to stream PUBG with his friends tonight, so i'll be able to watch them !!

  ","
  it's completely normal for you to want closure. however, i don't think it's a good idea to call him because you might hurt yourself more by doing that if he doesn't answer and ends up completely ignoring you.
  
  i'm sorry you're going through this, situations like these definitely suck. just try to focus on yourself during these times, do a lot of self care, see your friends, etc etc. you existed before him and you can continue to exist after him.

  i can understand someone's pronouns changing if they're still traversing the complexities of gender and they don't quite know what gender they are yet, it's experimental and a way to see what they're most comfortable using.

  "
419417,"
   And it's usually paranoia. The fact the they avoid contact with strangers and feel danger from it may have roots in their past negative expriences or their adoption in their family and culture. They isolate themselves and escape from socialising.
  ","
  this is true, but i also don't believe the paranoia is unwarranted. there are plenty of valid reasons to refrain from talking to people online, *especially* if they're coming from a position where opening up to someone in the past has left them vulnerable.
  
  but the bottom line is that people are allowed to ignore whoever they want regardless of their reasons for feeling uncomfortable. no one is obligated to talk to someone else simply because they exist, regardless of gender.
  "
419418,"
   But i seek to finding out what is the reason behind their uncomfortability. What is their mental state and what is goung througgh their mind that causes them back off from communication.
  ","
  it depends on the individual. some people simply don't want to converse with strangers and aren't willing to entertain the idea, while others fear for their safety and privacy.
  "
419419,"
   They should give a good reason for not interacting with a particular person. When i try to make them justify their actions, i find the reason is their lack of logic, lack of free thinking and paranoia. Simply saying ""i don't want to"" is not the right answer.
  ","
  not wanting to talk to someone is a perfectly valid reason to not talk to someone. like i said, no one is obligated to talk to a person simply because that person exists. if they feel uncomfortable in that position, anyone has the right to cease conversation.
  "
419420,"
   The relevance is that girls are being so close minded and protective because of their prejudices and false assumptions based on guys' race, nationality and style. This is how it goes in their mind: ""you are not from my country or my race or style or class. So automatically we are done communicating.
  ","
  as long as they're not being racist or classist, then there's nothing wrong with refusing to talk to a person. no one should be forced to communicate with a person they don't want to speak to, especially if the person trying to talk to them is making them uncomfortable.
  
  women in particular shouldn't feel obligated to talk to men solely because the man reached out to them. if that woman feels uncomfortable with that interaction, then she has every right to cease communication, ignore the message, or block the person attempting to talk to her.

Yes. Responding or ignoring is your choice. But some girls reply in unwelcoming ways falsely accuse the guy of being a creep and pervert and keep telling him to go away. Why should it be like this? Why can't they respect others' feelings and care about their emotions?

  if someone is doing something that's making you feel uncomfortable, you have every right to call out that behavior and ignore the person making the unwanted advances.

   How do you react when a stranger guy sends you message on social media?
  ","
  this generally doesn't happen to me, but the few times it did, i just ignored the message.
  "
419434,"
   Do you prefer to have a lot or a few friends? Who are you comfortable around strangers?
  ","
  i prefer having a small group of friends over larger groups of friends. i've always had a small inner circle, and i only really talk to perhaps 4-5 people regularly these days.
  
  i'm not generally comfortable around strangers, so i usually try to do things in the public when the least amount of people are around (like running errands super early in the morning or late at night).

  i've been replaying fallout 4 a lot lately, actually, in preparation for fallout 76 that comes out next month.
  
  i also just recently finished the first episode of life is strange 2, and i'm debating on purchasing the new destiny 2 DLC, forsaken. i have the rest of the DLCs but i need to see how much money this one is first.
  
  i've also been meaning to buy the new tomb raider game, but i'm waiting for it to go on sale.

  i'm not at a point in my life where i want to be involved in a child's life like that, so i don't think i would feel comfortable dating a person who has a child.
  
  i don't even know if i want children in the future.
  "
419438,"
   Why? Are you shy?
  ","
  i'm not really shy, but i do have social anxiety -- especially when it comes to talking on the phone. i dread making phone calls when it comes to scheduling appointments, but obviously i have to do it anyway.
  
  my boyfriend is also horrible at texting (lol) so it's much easier for us to catch up by talking on the phone rather than texting.
  "
419439,"
   sorry to hear about that friend. Did you try to explain to her that you don’t have enough money? Best course of action is to ignore
  ","
  it isn't my friend, it was my mother who was saying those things. it's difficult to ignore her considering i live with her.
  "
419440,"
   Do you agree all humans are selfish? Is selfishness a train you are born with?
  ","
  i think we're all selfish to a certain degree, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. it's perfectly okay to be selfish because our needs are just as important as anyone else's needs, and its healthy to recognize that we should do things for ourselves and put ourselves first at times.
  "

   why are you in a bad mood?
  ","
  my mother has been a tyrannical mess ever since i got home this morning and has been yelling at me for every small thing i've done for the past hour.
  
  this morning, she wanted me to go to a particular bagel store and buy her a bunch of food and spend money we don't have, even though we have more than enough food at the house and i wasn't feeling well enough to make the stop on the way home. she got angry with me, and when i got home, she told me she called in the order anyway so that i had no choice but to go back out and pick her food up.
  
  when i got home from that, she started yelling about how my father and i are ""useless"" because we couldn't find a particular set of dishes for the kitchen and basically went off on how we're both lazy and not good for anything.
  "
419444,"
   In what  way you would sacrifice your happiness?
  ","
  for example, if i'm not feeling up to doing something but i know it would make him happy, i'll get over my own feelings and do it for him.
  
  usually that translates to little things, like picking up food for him on my way over to his house, etc etc.
  "
419445,"
   Whose happiness more important yours or your bf’s?

  they're equally as important -- although i would sacrifice my happiness for my boyfriend's happiness, realistically both partner's happiness are equally as important and no one should make you choose between one or the other.

  ","
  i am !! i probably won't buy it for a while because i'm more focused on other games, but the first game was legendary.
  "
419448,"
   umm no. its not because its ""taboo"". its because the partner feels actual feelings of hurt and pain. not everything is a social construct. being jealous of someone is an actual thing and a normal feeling.
  ","
  some people feel jealousy, hurt, and pain -- which is why polyamory wouldn't work for them. however, there are some people who thrive in polyamorous relationships. everyone experiences love differently.
  "
419449,"
   i dont understand how you can be in love with a partner, and be ok with that partner being with and doing things with other people.
  ","
  a lot of people don't understand polyamory because they're so used to the idea of monogamy, and polyamory is pretty much taboo in today's society for that reason.
  "
419450,"
   Do you believe or feel there is a difference between cheating and being involved in a polyamorous relationship?
  ","
  being in a polyamorous relationship isn't cheating because both partners have agreed and consented to each other also seeing other people alongside their current relationship.
  
  however, cheating can happen in polyamorous relationships if one person goes behind their partner's back to see someone, lies about it, etc etc. even though they're free to see who they want, there's an underlying understanding of communication and honesty when it comes to polyamory.

   would you ever do a polyamorous relationship?
  ","
  my boyfriend and i have discussed it from time to time, but we don't think it would serve our relationship for the better. i still have issues with jealousy that i'm constantly working on, and being in a polyamorous relationship while having jealousy issues wouldn't be constructive to our relationship.
  "
419454,"
   Are you a fighter for the the things that matter to you and/or for yourself?
  ","
  yes, i'm very much a fighter for the things & people i care about. i'll bend over backwards if it meant making a loved one happy and i'll never stop fighting toward the causes i'm passionate about.
  "
419455,"
   What do you think about love?
  ","
  love isn't meant to be all sunshine and roses, and you *will* go through hardship with your partner. what defines your relationship is how well you undergo conflicts together and communicate with each other during struggles.
  
  if someone is giving off the impression that their relationship is all good times, then they're either hiding the bad parts of the relationship or they simply haven't experienced hardship yet. you can still be in love with someone, and vice versa, and experience struggle with them -- it's a natural part of being human.

  ","
  i wouldn't go so far as to say i hate people, but i'm definitely not a people person and i prefer having a small, intimate circle as opposed to a large one.
  "
419458,"
   Are you jealous?
  ","
  i have a tendency to be a jealous person, but it's something i'm always working on because jealousy is a toxic emotion and doesn't serve anyone.
  
  a large part of jealousy is that you have to remember your worth. just because someone is experiencing something doesn't automatically mean you don't deserve to have the same experiences. it also doesn't mean that person deserves it more than you do. sometimes life is unfair and we have to deal with that.
  "
419459,"
   How do you deal with the first argument as a couple?
  ","
  i honestly don't even remember what our first argument was about or how i dealt with it, haha.

  "
419460,"

  when i went to RTX four years ago, i saw some amazing cosplays !! obviously they weren't halloween costumes, but they still require a lot of hard work and creativity, and the results were outstanding.

  i haven't needed to look for a new partner in a number of years, so i honestly have no clue what i would look for.

  ","
  it isn't right to laugh at people's triggers, regardless of context -- people have made such light out of triggers in recent years and it's become so harmful toward people who actually struggle with triggers because they feel as if their triggers aren't valid anymore. there have been recent studies indicating that patients are not acknowledging their triggers because of the social stigma attached to having them, as society today has turned a trigger into a joke.
  
  it's perfectly common and normal for a person to become triggered if they see someone who looks like their abvser, and it's no one's fault that it occurs. having a trigger is a physiological and psychological response, and a lot of people don't have control over that.

   I don't think you have to make a scene to stand up for what you believe. I'm not afraid to stand up for what I believe and I have major social anxiety
  ","
  me saying that i disagree is standing up for what i believe in too, though. however, i also know that if such an event were to take place, i realistically wouldn't even entertain the notion or get into a conversation about it because i would have to be somewhere else. i would honestly just tell the person no and that i disagreed, and i would be on my way.
  "
419747,"
   Why be so polite? I would tell them ""no that's wrong"" And I don't know if I believe you anyway. You're kinda rude to me when I criticize your feminist gender garbage.
  ","
  telling them that i disagree with their opinion is basically the same thing as saying they're wrong, lol. either way, if some random person approached me and asked me to sign a petition that said that, i wouldn't care enough to make a big deal out of it. i would just brush them off and continue on my way.

   Hey guys! ?
For you: Which of your personality traits has been the most useful?

-Ciao peeps-
  ","
  i suppose my inquisitive nature. it helped me a lot in college because i always strived to learn more than simply what the professor taught us, which helped me a lot in regards to papers and exams. if it wasn't for my high marks in college and my degree, i wouldn't have obtained the jobs i had/have.
  "

  my week has been cold and rainy, & i'm loving it. i prefer this weather over sunny days so i've been in a fairly good mood when i'm not acting over emotional about random events in my life (lol).
  
  today wasn't a bad day either. i just got home from work and i'm debating on either watching the new season of wentworth or playing destiny 2.
  "
419752,"

  ","
  probably not. i don't want to know my future because it would probably turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy or i would focus on it all the time.
  "
419753,"
   Is it ever comforting to think that if you ever deliberately or inadvertently commit a serious crime, you can just play the Cray Card?
  ","
  i don't believe you understand how difficult it is for people to actually get an insanity plea. it's extremely rare because they have to prove that the person had no self awareness or control over their actions during the time of the crime.
  "
419754,"
   How do you feel about casual s*x?
  ","
  as long as it's consensual, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. let people live their lives the way they want to live them.
  "
419755,"
   Have you ever had to deal with bad/loud neighbors? How did it go?
  ","
  i have one neighbor who's an asshole, and my parents have talked to him about his behavior but he still insists on being an asshole.
  
  during the summer, he was yelling and screaming at the landscapers on my property who were literally just doing their job. it was ridiculous.
  "
419756,"
   We were close friends, what if I still want her in my life?
  ","
  if you can't sort your problems out or if you're not seeing eye on eye on important things even after discussing them thoroughly, then there may not be a friendship to salvage.
  
  yeah, it's difficult to go through, but there's also no point in holding onto the memories of a friendship when that friendship can't be fixed no matter what you do to try. you'll only hurt yourself in the long run.
  "
419757,"
   What will you do when an apology n talking isn't enough to fix things?
  ","
  depends on the nature of the relationship. if your issues can't be fixed through communicating about those issues, then perhaps you're better off going your separate ways.
  "
419758,"
   If your son/daughter or future one whatever was caught bullying someone how would you deal with it
  ","
  i'd probably have a serious conversation with them regarding the ramifications of bullying and how it leads people to svicide. bullying is a serious matter and should be handled properly.
  "
419759,"
   Where you bullied in school
  ","
  yeah, i was bullied a lot in middle school in particular.
  "
419760,"
   What do you think about bullying and how to deal with it
  ","
  obviously bullying is a terrible thing to do and endure, and it leads to increased risk and rate of svicide in young adults, teenagers, and children.
  
  as for how to deal with it, it depends on the scenario and what the safest option may be. sometimes it's standing up for yourself while other times its ignoring the bully completely. other forms of bullying can warrant intervention from authority.

419762,"
   How can you tell if you’re growing (spiritually, mentally, emotionally, etc)?
  ","
  i don't think it's something you can tell in the current moment -- rather, it's something you realize in retrospect due to a variety of factors, whether it's your opinions changing on things, your patience and tolerance growing, or you're even finding yourself more content with yourself or your life in small ways.
  
  i never knew i grew as a person until i've looked back at who i was and compared myself then to now. it takes a bit of critical thinking and the ability to be honest with yourself, but people are constantly evolving.
  "
419763,"
   Do you think models on social media put pressure on people?
  ","
  yeah, of course. it places a certain expectation on people, especially younger people, and it makes them feel inadequate if they don't fit into that ideal of what a person is """"supposed"""" to look like.

   What do you consider to be a healthy relationship?
  ","
  a healthy relationship is one where everyone involved in the relationship understands one another or seeks to understand each other without judgment or anger. it's being supportive of your partner(s) through their goals and aspirations and having a willingness to help. it's the ability to make certain sacrifices and compromises for the betterment of the relationship and sharing responsibility. it's being able to apologize for mistakes and going through with making sure those mistakes don't happen again.

   What is your opinion on people blaming Ariana Grande for Mac Miller's death?
  ","
  i think it's disgusting and ignorant. mac miller struggled with mental illness & drug addiction long before he dated her, and their breakup was amicable and she constantly was offering him help for his issues and trying to give him the resources he needed.
  
  people who disregard or blatantly insult those who are addicts or mentally ill obviously have never been around addicts and its exhausting to hear about them being considered inferior to the rest of the population. drug addiction is a mental health issue above all else.

  ","
  people who don't understand or don't have mental illness sometimes glorify the struggles mentally ill people go through because they think it's ""relatable"" or ""trendy.""

   Why acting “stupid” is considered cute? Do people actually like stupidity?
  ","
  i never understood it either. it probably stems from the idea that women were (and still partially are) considered ""dumber"" than men so a dumb women would have been more attractive to men in the past. the tradition has probably been ingrained for generations.

  needing space is normal in any kind of relationship, especially if a person requires more alone time or works through their issues better when they're alone. my boyfriend and i take space from each other occasionally, since he's the type of person who needs alone time to really think and get his sh*t together.
  
  the silent treatment, on the other hand, is borderline abvsive. you're purposely withholding contact from someone to hurt them, and that isn't healthy by any means.

  yeah, that isn't fair to you -- relationships should be about compromise, which means that if something doesn't work out then you come to a mutual agreement that benefits both of you. it ideally shouldn't be one way or the other.

  "
419856,"
   do you worry about your relationship not lasting?
  ","
  occasionally, yeah. however, it's also a bit destructive to think about ideas like that because you realistically should be focusing on the present moment with your partner and making the best out of the moments in front of you.
  
  the thought crosses my mind since i'm always terrified of him breaking up with me, but being mindful of the present and the things he does every day to prove his love helps.

  i personally don't believe it should be legal for the drinking age to be lower than 21 in the united states. honestly, i even think 21 is a bit young for people to be able to legally drink because there are still a lot of issues regarding young adults and drinking, especially when it comes to driving.

  people gain by trust through earning it -- close friendships, loyalty, chemistry, etc etc. i don't trust most people and i don't willingly give out my trust to people whom i don't know well, and it does take a while for me to warm up to someone.

  life versus death -- typically, the notion that some people think they have the moral high ground to take the life of another person if they're deemed too much of a danger to society, much like the whole ""for the greater good"" mentality.

  depends on the circumstance, since some people are negative for realistic reasons and others are negative because they're willfully ignorant of the brighter side of things.
  
  sometimes my boyfriend can have a negative outlook on things, especially if he's going through a rough patch, but i usually try to remind him of the things that *are* going well in his life and that he's strong and can survive everything that's thrown his way.

  ","
  it isn't normal, but it's definitely a side effect of your BPD because we constantly need reassurance and validation, and if our loved ones aren't in contact with us, we feel as if they're purposely harming us by withholding contact.
  
  i don't think you should cut ties at all. you have to try to rationalize to yourself that this person is living their own life and may not have time to text you back as often as they would like, and it isn't being done in a malicious manner. they have no reason to purposely ignore you, and you have to remind yourself of that.
  
  idk if this helps or not, but i do understand exactly how you feel because i've lashed out for the same reasons regarding certain people in my life when i've felt ignored too. it's shitty but you have to be mindful of everything and take into consideration things that are going on in their lives as well.

  you won't be helping her by consoling her because it's only going to make her miss the relationship that much more and harder for her to move on from you. you're better off letting it pass with time, as hard as it might be.

  ","
  it depends on the context and how discreet the innuendos are. if it's something that a kid of that particular age group won't pick up on, then i suppose it's fine. adults watch childrens tv shows with their kids so a joke every now and again would be entertaining for the adults at least.

   children destroy marriages/relationships. do you agree?

  no, i disagree. while the prospect of having a child might be hurtful to some relationships, it's usually because the relationship itself is flawed in some significant way to the point where neither person can handle a big change, which causes the relationship to crumble.
  
  sometimes having children can enrich existing relationships too, though. it can cause you to develop stronger feelings for your partner, seeing them in a parental role. i know plenty of relationships which have strengthened after the couple had children.

   If your boyfriend keeps repeating the same mistakes over and over again would you forgive him?

  eventually, no -- generally if a person keeps repeating their mistakes over again, even after being talked to about the problem and how to remedy the problem, then that shows that they don't care enough about your relationship to work actively to improve themselves.

420014,"
   Does having trust issues mean that you're the problem or that the people around you aren't trustworthy?
  ","
  it depends entirely on the situation. however, just because you have problems trusting others doesn't necessarily mean that you have a problem per say ; lacking trust in others is usually an outcome of an environmental cause, you're given a strong reason not to trust other people because you've been betrayed so often in the past.
  
  that doesn't imply that not trusting others is wrong since it's a normal reaction to being betrayed, manipulated, or abvsed. for example, i have problems trusting people but i don't really consider it a personal fault because it's an effect of what has happened to me, and those people who are worthy of being trusted will understand why it takes you a long time to trust them.

  not at all -- your gender doesn't determine which products you should or should not use. it's unfortunate that most beauty products are geared toward women, but that doesn't make it wrong if men and others want to use them too. self care is important.

  just because tattoos are painful doesn't mean i won't get them, lol. the personal value of a tattoo means so much more to me than the pain i'll endure.

  happiness is waking up with the love of your life and having the entire day off to do whatever you want at your own pace, with no expectations.

   Who is your favorite fictional character? Why?
  ","
  aahh, i have so many !!
  
  i guess i'll narrow it down to two, though -- draco malfoy & chloe price.
  
  i've always found draco to be a fascinating character because he's essentially a victim of abvse, and throughout the series, you can see him trying to break free from the reins of his family's expectations but nevertheless still being held back against his will. you realize as the series goes on that he has genuinely been brainwashed into believing what he does by his father, and he doesn't want to live that lifestyle at all.
  
  chloe price, on the other hand, has always been a relatable character to me because of her strength, impulsivity, reckless need to escape, and passion for her friends. she's one of the most unpredictable and entertaining fictional characters i've witnessed and the depth of her personality knows no bounds.

  for the most part, yes. although there are basic standard moral codes that are universally accepted, it doesn't necessarily mean that *all* people agree with them or abide by them. they're dependent upon your own personal experiences, so everyone is going to have a slightly different moral code compared to everyone else.
  "
420056,"
   How do/would you handle this situation? You’re single & meet an amazing (also single) person. S/he’s got everything you’re looking for, w 1 big con (for you. It’s not necessarily a con for everyone). Do you pursue anyway? Discuss with them and mutually agree on a decision? Something else?
  ","
  i think it depends entirely on what the con is & how much of an impact you believe it can potentially have on you / your relationship. everyone has different standards.
  
  however, if this person has everything else you're looking for with the exception of that one con, then i would personally attempt to pursue it anyway. open dialogue with them and express that it *may* be an issue but you want to explore this first and see if you can't work around it.
  
  in my experience, it's always been better for me to experience things and learn from those experiences, even if they eventually ended badly. you honestly never know what may happen and sometimes opportunities present themselves in strange ways.

  "
420092,"
   Yeah. I agree with you that you can't keep a house clean 24/7, but before inviting acquaintances over,  you should at least do some cleaning, it's about having decency.

  ","
  i never disagreed with that part of it -- if it's posing a sanitary hazard, then yeah that's obviously gross if the glass wasn't clean.
  
  when people used to come to my house, i would clean and tidy things up to look presentable. but to have the house pristine 24/7 is a bit uncommon. it's an ideal setting but a lot of people don't have the opportunity to deep cleanse as often as you do.
  "
420093,"
   I'm 23, not ""too young"" to have kids, but my mom and I both clean daily and don't assume we stay at home all day, we have jobs too but never will we neglect our house.

  ","
  i never said you were too young to have kids. i was insinuating that when you have children, it'll be harder to keep the house clean all the time like it is now.
  
  either way, perhaps i'm coming from a different perspective because my family has never had a pristine home even though i do routinely clean.
  "
420094,"

  if you're worried about gossip and have the time to keep your house pristine 24/7, then i'm assuming you're very young and don't have children.
  
  i don't have children either, but i'm realistic and know that you can't keep a house clean 24/7. it's unreasonable.
  "
420095,"
   Do you think it's a bit rude when someone invites you over to their house, to tell them things such as ""your house is a mess, clean up, look at the dishes and the furniture, it's dusty""
  ","
  yeah, that's incredibly rude. no one's house is perfect and they're probably even more aware of the state of their house than you are, you don't need to be rude about it.
  
  if it's causing a sanitary issue, that's a different problem. but if there are a few dishes in the sink and the cabinets are a bit dusty, then that's not a big deal at all because everyone's house is like that.
  "
420096,"
   Have you ever shown anyone kindness and forgiveness but regretted it later

420106,"
   Do you find it attractive when someone is persistent? Ex. Keeps asking someone out until they say yes.

  no, i don't find that attractive at all. it's extremely relentless and forceful, and it means that person cannot take no for an answer.
  
  if a person asks another one out and they initially say no, the ideal thing for that person to do is accept their response and move on. by repeating the question, it places unnecessary pressure on the other individual to the point where they eventually date the other out of pity, fear, or frustration. that isn't a good basis upon which to establish a relationship.

   Under what circumstances do you block people on social media?

  so i received a bunch of questions regarding gender & they all disappeared before i could answer them. i'm assuming that anon got banned.
  
  however, they asked how many genders there are -- there isn't a number associated with gender because it exists on a spectrum.
  
  the anon also inquired as to why there are ""so many"" genders now compared to years ago, when there was just ""male and female"" -- male and female are sexes, not genders, so they still exist. for a long time, people thought that you could only be a man or a woman, but as we learn more about gender, we become open to the idea that gender isn't limited to just a man or a woman and it occurs in a spectrum format.
  
  the anon also called trans people ""transxxual"" and indicated that those who were trans weren't ""normal"" people -- this is also false, as the term transxxual is extremely outdated and doesn't reflect what transgender actually is. in addition, to refer to cis people as normal insinuates that being cis is almost a default, which shouldn't be encouraged.

  long distance relationships take a lot of work, so it feels different in the aspect that you have to really put aside a lot of time and effort in order to maintain the relationship by talking to them routinely, and letting them know how much you're thinking of them and appreciating them. similar to having a relationship where you two see one another regularly, there needs to be a lot of open and honest communication, as well as a strong foundation of trust.

  for me personally, i'm turning 27 this year. i use facebook, instagram, askfm, twitter, and snapchat.
  "
420253,"

  ","
  yeah, most of them do. my boyfriend has told me that he's constantly worried about me and he's always checking up on me, which is something i do appreciate.
  
  yesterday, for example, he went out to run a few errands and i stayed home to finish up some work. i decided to lay down when i was done, so when he got home, he got concerned and thought i was having an episode because i was just laying in bed with all the lights off.

  we've established and built a relationship that has been eight years in the making. to throw all of that away and break that foundation of trust would be devastating, and even if he apologized, that doesn't take away from the fact that he purposely did something to betray that trust, knowing it would hurt me.

   Their unhappiness may seem valid but the problem may be how they are percieving rather than some actual problem itself.  Like, they may simply be making a problem that isn't really there any way apart from their own input into making it a problem.  Do you get what I mean?
  ","
  in a sense, i sorta understand what you mean. however, in order to live in this society we must deal with those expectations regardless of whether or not they're ridiculous. it doesn't change the truth of how reality is and it doesn't diminish the struggles people face as a result of those societal expectations. you can't simply pretend that they don't have an effect on people.

   what do you think about the whole ""if you're not diagnosed by a professional, then you're not mentally ill // your mental health is irrelevant"" thing? I mean, a lot of people get sick but some people can't afford it, does that make them less sick?
  ","
  i think that's a toxic & invalidating mindset. people recognize that they're mentally ill, especially with respect to depression and anxiety, and not everyone can afford to be professionally diagnosed, obtain medication, or attend therapy. it doesn't make someone struggle less if they're not in treatment, since treatment is often a privilege (unfortunately).
  
  that being said, i don't agree with self diagnosis of complex disorders because that *should* be diagnosed by a trained professional, since they're the only ones who can differentiate one disorder from the other. it's fine to have suspicion that you have an illness but if you're going around saying that you're definitely borderline or dependent or antisocial, then that is just insulting to people who genuinely do have those disorders.

   There is no such thing as homophobia. That is the biggest insult on homosexuals actually. Also of course there are logical explanations of being an animal. I don't know if you believe in Magic but it exists. A wizard could turn you into a dragon using a spell. Would that change your gender ?

420317,"
   I understand a person can be homosexual but that doesn't change his gender. That is still a male person. Same goes with everything else. Only way to change gender is by operation and that is because you are changing genitals which proves that it depends on that.

  again, you're thinking about sex -- people can have transition surgery to change their genitals and undergo hormone therapy to alter their secondary sex characteristics.
  
  you're right that someone's sexual orientation does not have any correlation with their gender. but again, your idea of gender is actually the definition of what sex is.
  "
420318,"
   I think you are wrong. Can you explain why sex and gender are different ? Because they really are exactly the same. Even in the English language they are synonyms (in my language they mean the exact same thing too). So how are they different ? Sex and gender are the same and depend on genitals.
  ","
  i just explained how sex & gender are different. they're not synonymous with each other anymore because society as a whole has developed a deeper understanding of what gender truly is and how it is and isn't correlated with people's assigned sex.

   gender of a person depends on their genitals. that makes a person either male or female. there can never be a third gender because there can never be a third genital.
  ","
  no, you're thinking about sex. your sex is dependent upon your chromosomes, which in term influences what genitalia you develop. there's also a term called intersex, which is a chromosomal anomaly in which people aren't entirely male or female.
  
  gender, however, is different from your sex. you can be a man, woman, non-binary, etc etc. gender exists on a spectrum so there's really no ""number"" as to how many genders there are, but nevertheless they all fall under the trans spectrum unless a person is cisgender (meaning their gender aligns with their assigned sex).

  then that's a conversation you need to have with your partner. if you're unhappy with your intimate life then you need to communicate that with your partner, as hard as it might be.
  
  excess masturbation is only a problem if it causes issues in your personal or professional lives. if your behavior is causing a rift between yourself and your partner then that's something you need to change.

   Why is it instilled in males and who's doing the installing?
  ","
  society, the media, parents, friends, etc etc. males have been taught for centuries that they're supposed to be the stronger or more superior sex compared to females and a lot of that is tied into the physical act of having sex.
  "
420431,"
   Do you think that most guys have a different understanding of sex and love compared to girls understanding?
  ","
  i think males are conditioned from an early age to equate sex with attention and respect, while its different for females, who are taught that you should only have sex with someone you love.
  
  there's a higher pressure on males to have sex and lose their virginity because of hypermasculinity, and that's automatically geared toward heterosexual males. a lot of their lives revolve around sex and that's instilled in them from an early age.

  i don't think children should be drinking or smoking marijuana under the age of 18. it hinders their development otherwise. however, i would definitely talk to my children about the risks of doing those kinds of behaviors underage and give them the proper tools they need if they wanted to do it against my wishes. it's better for them to be safe while doing it than to ignore the problem entirely.

  we already went over this. you can think i'm lying all you want, but the truth is that he contradicts his own statements. just because you think he was pro-gay marriage the second he was sworn in doesn't mean that he didn't spend a majority of his campaign against gay marriage.

  your answer looks like it got cut off. ://
  
  either way, it sounds as if we're simply misunderstanding each other. i don't believe that people should be able to refuse business to others based on their race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc etc. like my other anon said, if a person is being hostile and becomes a threat to the business, then yes, that's a valid reason to refuse service. but you shouldn't be able to refuse service to a person based entirely on a bias you hold against an entire group of people.

   Well, in the United States, any purchase that is at least 1000$ or more (really depends on regional location), that you can make payments on, the credit bureaus award ""points"" for payments (on time), and those points go towards your overall credit rating score.

  yes !! i'm going to a meet n greet event to meet and take a photo with mike shinoda of linkin park later this month, and i'm honestly so excited and nervous and terrified all at the same time because linkin park has been a saving grace in my life and i don't know how to convey those emotions to mike so i'm probably going to write him a letter. :'))

   Mood Monday: Current mood? (insert rant if necessary:)
  ","
  i'm honestly not feeling well today at all, and that's partially because i haven't been able to take my mood stabilizer for the past two days so now my mind is all frazzled and i've been overwhelmed by the simplest of things. ://
  
  i want to do things to occupy myself, but i don't have the motivation to do anything at all. besides picking up the tickets yesterday, i've done absolutely nothing and the only reason why i was able to get the tickets in the first place is because my boyfriend drove me to the venue. i want to do a water and filter change on my fish tank but even that seems daunting.

  yeah, and it's definitely not as if i'm glorifying smoking by any means or promoting it or saying that its good for you. it's legit just a photo of me having a cigarette in my backyard, and the reason why i took the photo was because my skin looked good, LOL.

  the idea of being able to live independently with my boyfriend in our own house & starting our own lives together somewhere away from our families.

  i think we're born as blank slates to a certain degree in that our environment raises and nurtures us into developing the personality we have today. especially when it comes to opinions we may hold, if our families have enough of an influence on them.
  
  however, there is also a genetic component in that people are more predisposed to certain behaviors based on family history. it's a combination of environmental and genetic factors.

  ","
  it's difficult to really give a straightforward explanation because addiction is complex and differs depending on the person. people can have naturally addictive personalities and jump from addiction to addiction, while others fall into addiction without having the natural predisposition for addictive behavior.
  
  if you're concerned about your friend's habit, then rehabilitation is always the best go-to when it comes to recovery. however, you have to keep in mind that it only works if someone *wants* to be better and puts in the time & effort to change their behavior.

  you can have opinions that align with certain forms of feminism without being affiliated with the feminist movement.

  i used to never put myself first because i believed that other people's wants / needs were more important than mine. i didn't feel as if i deserved to be important and that i existed solely to help other people.

  why are you mentally ill ??
  
  -- most of the time it's b/c of trauma, so it can be interpreted as insensitive and trigger symptoms in people.
  
  why don't you just change your attitude ??
  
  -- mental illness isn't something that can be helped and simply changing your attitude towards life or a situation won't alleviate symptoms of mental illness.
  
  why don't you work out to make yourself feel better ??
  
  -- while working out releases endorphins and makes someone feel 'good,' it isn't a cure-all for mental illness and can especially exacerbate symptoms in people with eating disorders or body dysphoria.

  what exactly are you confused about?
  
  your gender is who you are separate from your personality. it's feeling whether you're a woman or a man or somewhere in between. just like how cis people know they're men or women, trans people know their gender doesn't match their assigned sex.
  
  it matters to some people obviously because it's a large component of who they are and some trans people experience dysphoria, which means they feel as if they're in the wrong body. it greatly affects self esteem and self image.
  
  here's a somewhat okay chart to help explain ;

  so i totally forgot to post something yesterday regarding trans day of visibility ;
  
  -- trans people represent about 0.3% of the population, although that number is expected to be higher due to the amount of people who aren't out yet.
  
  -- trans people are more likely to be physically & sxxually assaulted, which results in higher rates of attempted svicide. about 40% of trans people have attempted in the past.
  
  -- likewise, 70% of trans people feel more comfortable with themselves after they've transitioned, especially in workplace settings. that's why hrt and transition surgeries are so important.
  
  -- being transgender is not a mental disorder, contrary to popular belief. while some trans people are mentally ill, there's no correlation between the two concepts.
  
  -- trans people are just as deserving of acceptance as people of other gender identities, and there needs to be more awareness of trans identities in society.

  ... i already explained this. if you don't want to believe me, then that's on you.
  "
421217,"
   These genders you're talking about have been recorded in history for hundreds of years? What does it even mean to be a gender that's not male or female? How does that work I don't understand this at all
  ","
  male and female are sexes. they're your biologically assigned sexes at birth.
  
  gender is how you feel toward yourself and how you express yourself in terms of man, woman, trans, non-binary, etc etc. if your gender doesn't match your assigned sex, then you're trans. if your gender does match your assigned sex, then you're cis.

  i usually confront them straight away. i have no time or patience to play games with people to see if they'll continue lying, and i would rather be honest and confront them with the issue first hand rather than wait for the 'perfect' moment.

  a person's conscience is their own set of morals and ethics ; their belief system, their concept of right vs wrong, etc etc.

  and now i'm slipping into an episode because i can't control how people say things and my mind is reeling over what they could have meant and if they're angry with me. if they're going to give up on me. but i can't express this to them otherwise it's going to make it larger than it should be, and i'm afraid of them saying that they *are* angry with me because i won't be able to handle that.

  absolutely, yes. mental illnesses can be just as debilitating as physical illnesses, preventing a person from being able to carry out their ordinary activities of daily living and functioning correctly in a work environment.
  
  i worked for a disability law firm for more than two years, and we had thousands of mental health cases, both alone and existing with other physical conditions. in most cases, mental health problems only exacerbated physical illnesses and vice versa. having mental health problems makes living with physical disabilities even more difficult, and physical illnesses often have the ability to make mental health problems worse as well.

   Do you think it's healthy for men to cry?
  ","
  of course it is -- crying is a natural human reaction to emotional and physical stimuli, and it doesn't make someone less of a 'man' if they cry.
  
  crying is a form of cathartic release, and it helps release endorphins into the bloodstream, the 'feel good' chemicals that provide us with a sense of relief after we've cried. it's purely a biological reaction, and it has no bearing on someone's gender.

  even if the government doesn't do anything after today's marches, that certainly doesn't mean that activists should give up their fight -- and by the looks of things, the most passionate activists are the teenagers and young adults who will comprise the next generation of politics.

  advocating for gun control certainly isn't a radical view, especially in light of the increasing number of shootings this nation has witnessed in 2018 alone.
  
  gun control will never be pointless, and at this current point in time, it's necessary in order to protect the lives of our children and the generations after us. there's no harm in making it more difficult for people to obtain guns because those who will use those guns responsibly won't find it problematic to go through processing in order to be a registered gun user.

  black people are still largely discriminated against in this country, especially in lgbt circles. according to society, it's more socially 'acceptable' to be white and trans than it is to be black and trans, and there's less media coverage on black lives lost compared to white lives lost.

  ","
  the problem with therapy is that you have to be at a point where you're aware that you need professional help and you have to be willing to accept help, even if it's not what you had in mind. it requires an open mind.
  
  if someone isn't ready to accept help for their problems, then they won't get anything out of therapy -- i used to be in that position when i was a teenager. i saw a therapist when i was 14 years old, but i refused to believe that i needed help, so i didn't get anything out of the sessions and stopped attending. it wasn't until 2016 when i realized that i severely needed professional help otherwise i was going to end up dead.
  "
421512,"
   I'm really glad it's helping! That's wonderful improvement.
  ","
  thank you !! i still have my slip ups here and there, as well as occasional depressive episodes, but they're not nearly as debilitating as they used to be and i can still function through my episodes until they dissipate. i always become discouraged whenever they happen, but my therapist always reminds me that i'm still making improvements and my episodes will never be as disabling as they were two years ago, and i'm constantly improving every week i see her.

  i wholeheartedly agree !! like i was saying to celine, prior to taking medication, i could barely function as a human being and merely existed, even though i didn't want to exist. i've regained my life back after getting adjusted on medication (even though it took two years for me to find the right meds, haha), and i can't imagine my life without them.
  "
421514,"
   That's terrible! I'm of the mindset that unless really necessary, I'd be personally scared to take any medication (heck, even ibuprofen), but I totally see the benefit! It does wonders for the people that need it. It's so sad how many people adamantly refuse to see that.
  ","
  i used to have the same mindset too prior to starting psychiatric medication, i was afraid of becoming dependent on them. but over the course of the past two years, with the trial and error associated with finding new meds, i've learned that i genuinely do need certain medications in order to function on a daily basis, and there's nothing wrong with that.
  
  before i started medication, i slept for weeks. i missed work at least once per week. i couldn't leave my house. i didn't eat. i cried every day and had thoughts of svicide. and when i was at work, i couldn't focus and was prone to panic attacks. medication has helped me exponentially and it not only allows me to function at home and at work, but now i also have the motivation to take part in my hobbies.

  leigh isn't my real first name -- i honestly adopted leigh as my 'name' when i was a teenager, and i've been using it for more than a decade now.
  
  i originally came across the name while watching the saw movies, because one of the directors' names is leigh whannell. i thought leigh was a beautiful androgynous name.

421531,"
   What do you think of people who say emotional abuse is worse than physical abuse because it doesn't leave marks that can heal?
  ","
  i think it's shitty for people to allege that some forms of abvse are ""better"" than others -- abvse is abvse regardless of whether it's emotional or physical, and they're equally as traumatizing.
  
  not all physical abvse marks heal, either. people can experience chronic illnesses due to the effects of physical abvse, especially if it's prolonged.

  "
421537,"

  ","
  i'm fairly empathetic, as i can understand most of the time where certain people are coming from with their struggles and thoughts. i always try to seek to understand why some people behave the way they do and hear them out.

   Do you consider yourself a ""master"" at anything?

421554,"
   Is it okay for guys to cry?
  ","
  of course -- crying is a natural human reaction to stimuli, and it doesn't make anyone less of a 'man' for crying. it simply means you're human.
  
  we need to get rid of this concept of toxic masculinity because all it does is persuade men to suppress their emotions, and that isn't healthy at all.
  "
421555,"
   Is there a ""flaw"" that annoys you about your boyfriend pertaining to his personality?

  he's an extremely messy person, and our concepts of 'clean' are two completely different entities. he'll clean his room one day, and the next day, it somehow is a mess again. i have no idea how he does it tbh. he's an organized person in his mind, but his living areas are always a wreck.

  i think it works both ways for both males and females -- porn gives unrealistic expectations to both sexes. for women, it gives off the impression that big dicks = more pleasure, while for men, it gives off the impression that tight vaginas = a lesser experienced woman. both couldn't be further from the truth.

  obvious inquiries such as asking where a person lives, their phone number, their real name, their work place, their friends, etc etc. i also find that, with respect to askfm, a lot of anons don't understand the concept of 'privacy' so they'll ask invasive sexual questions. a lot of anons feel entitled to know private details about a person's history.

  remember that your mental illnesses do not define you, and you're still a complete & whole person regardless of your mental states -- you deserve to find someone who loves and cherishes you, even if you may think otherwise.
  
  it's obviously also important to find a person who's understanding of mental health issues, so if you're dating a person who clearly doesn't understand your illnesses, you're better off dropping them.

  LOL. that's certainly an interesting way to look at it. i think there's a difference between someone who's your therapist and someone who's your friend -- your therapist is supposed to listen to your thoughts, feelings, & experiences and give professional advice on how to cope with them, as well as make you view things in a different perspective. they went to school and studied mental illnesses so they have a clinical understanding of what people go through.
  
  friends aren't professionals and can only offer lay people advice and hope for the best. while you can tell your friends some of the things you go through, there's always the possibility of them judging you or telling someone else.

  as long as those charges are discussed prior to signing the contract and the buyer is fully aware of those charges, then i don't really see a problem with that (except for hidden charges, that's just a problem). i see nothing wrong with an exit penalty if you end a contract early because you were the one who originally agreed to the contract to its entirety.

  i support the me too movement because it's brought to light a lot of abvse that has occurred in not only the entertainment industry, but also in ordinary people's everyday lives -- people feel more comfortable calling out their abvsers.
  
  the only concern i have are false accusations, because there's always the possibility of people falsely accusing someone of abvsing them just to garner attention. while the chance of this happening is slim, and i believe we should always take survivors seriously, there's always that possibility and that unsettles me.

  being mentally ill doesn't excuse or justify someone's actions when it comes to committing mvrder. people who are mentally ill are more likely to be victims of violence rather than the perpetrator themselves.

  of course -- women propose to their significant others all the time, especially in lgbt+ relationships. it's 2018 and there aren't as many expectations on women to be the inferior, damsel in distress figure in relationships.

  ","
  my first instinct is to say yes -- if you truly love or care about that person, then you wouldn't feel compelled to change their personality.

  as far as i'm aware, taking a break with someone you were previously in a relationship with pretty much means you're broken up with the slim chance of getting back together in the future.
  
  if you're in the middle of a break and have a one night stand, i don't personally think it's cheating. after all, you're broken up with that person you were previously dating. regardless of how you want to spin it, going on a break insinuates that you've broken up temporarily, regardless of what the future holds.

  society has expectations placed on people which makes it seem abnormal for others to, for example, get married late or decide not to have children or remain single or go down career paths that are less than conventional.
  
  people are so concerned with the lives of others that they often don't do any introspection into their own lives, not realizing that one person is no better than another and we simply cannot pass judgment.

  idk, when i was 14, i dated someone who was 18 and soon turning 19 years old. i didn't realize it at the time because i was young and naive, but there was a reason why he couldn't find dates with people his own age and chronically went for people who were much younger than him.
  "
421903,"
   In your opinion, why do some mature males go for younger females?
  ","
  it's usually because they're creeps who can't seem to find a date with people their own age, so they prey on younger women and teenagers who are naive and don't know any better.
  "
421904,"
   It's said that the purpose of males and female attraction is for the purpose of procreation. How does female to female attraction fit with this paradigm when there is no chance of procreation? Is it a totally different form of attraction?
  ","
  people are sexually attracted to one another because they want to have sex with them, not for procreation, but for pleasure. humans are hedonistic creatures.
  
  people are also romantically attracted to one another because of the need for comfort, human touch, companionship, etc. there are also some people who do not experience sexual attraction, only romantic attraction.

  not necessarily, no -- sex obviously doesn't make a relationship work because it's purely on a physical scale, and at times, love alone can only take you so far.
  
  there needs to be patience, communication, and an understanding that people are their own individuals instead of solely a fragment of a relationship.
  
  while fighting is normal, if you're fighting more than you're content with one another, then it may be an indication of a problem. it doesn't mean you should give up on the relationship by any means, but you two should try to calmly communicate your feelings and try to resolve your issues in a healthy and mature manner.

  yeah i agree -- and also the whole ""you're not trans you're just not girly"" mindset is so close minded because none of these people even know what it feels like to not feel connected to your own body as if it's foreign and having to deal with people misgendering you simply because they don't ""agree"" with you being trans.
  
  so many people are transphobic and don't even realize it.
  "
421976,"
   you are just insecure with yourself and there's nothing wrong in not being girly or the stereotypical female. it doesnt mean you are of the wrong gender grow up.

  i never said there was anything wrong with not being girly or stereotypical -- i stared that ever since i was young, i felt that i've been in the wrong body.
  
  considering you're the one questioning a trans person on whether or not they're trans, i don't think i'm necessarily the one who needs to ""grow up."" regardless of what you think of me, i'm still non-binary and nothing is going to change that.

  it's both, in my case -- i'm fascinated by the psychology behind why a person chooses to commit murder, and i do love the gory aspects of certain crimes. at the same time, however, i also find the procedure behind solving a crime to be interesting because it takes a lot of investigative skill and intelligence to piece together a crime scene and locate a suspect.

  i don't fucking understand that mentality at all -- it's a diagnosis, not a death sentence, and you can't ignore how you react to things or your behavior simply because it's ""not a nice thing to have."" mental illness is ugly and horrible and difficult, it isn't supposed to be nice, and you can't be properly treated if you don't obtain the right diagnosis. it makes absolutely no sense.

  she basically told me, ""i don't need to know your story because the past doesn't matter and you should move forward with your life because otherwise you'll remain traumatized. you shouldn't even be talking about this in therapy.""
  
  like... how the fuck. trauma is what caused my behavior -- it's why i am the way i am today. even though the abvse isn't happening anymore, i still have symptoms resulting from it and just because you don't like labels doesn't mean you should take something off my chart that's been discussed in detail before and my precious doctor said i fit the criteria.
  
  i'm just so fucking pissed off at the lack of professionalism and how she essentially discounts my trauma and experiences. she only focuses on my depression and anxiety and basically insinuates that my other symptoms don't matter. what the fuck.

  1. my father -- we were talking about him driving me to get blood work done next week.
  
  2. my first friend was someone whose name started with a D. i remember them solely because i was extremely upset when they moved away.
  
  4. i only have a closely knit group of a few friends, perhaps 4 or 5 at the most. it's all i need.
  
  5. lately it's been ""drew barrymore"" by bryce vine.
  
  6. anything dramatic, psychological, or horror.
  
  7. yes, i'm in love with my boyfriend. ♡

   Are there fruit trees in your neighbourhood? Which fruits can grow where you live?
  ","
  there aren't in my neighborhood since i live in a suburban area, but there are a few different fruits which grow on long island.
  
  if you head out east, you run into dozens of different apple orchards and vineyards. there are wineries and cidarhouses everywhere.
  "
422047,"
   play station or x box? im thinking of getting one of them cant decide
  ","
  i've personally always used xbox, but the playstation consoles are also really good -- playstation tends to have better console-exclusive games, but xbox is more of an entertainment unit in that it has more apps and features than just gaming.
  
  you should probably research the perks of both xbox and playstation, and go from there. every gamer has different needs.
  "
422048,"
   if you see a bug crawling in your house, do you kick him or ho do you kill him ?
  ","
  i usually just kill them, unless they're big enough to where i wouldn't feel comfortable killing them. then usually i'll just trap them and release them outside.
  "
422049,"
   What's the longest time you've been away from this site? Why?
  ","
  i had deactivated for about a year once, due to a lot of personal problems going on in my life as well as not having enough time since i was a student.
  "
422050,"
   What's the longest you've ever gone without sleep? (if you even know)
  ","
  40 hours, or so. it definitely was not a fun time.
  "
422051,"
   Was today a good day?
  ","
  today wasn't wonderful, but it wasn't terrible either. nothing particularly eventful happened, which i suppose can be a good thing sometimes because it's better than having a bad day.
  
  i'm just really looking forward to sleeping. a lot.
  "
422052,"
   Will you be listening to Mike Shinoda's ' Post Traumatic' EP?
  ","
  i've already listened to it dozens of times over, it's such a heart wrenching rendition of his grief and i'm so proud of the courage it took for him to record those songs.
  "
422053,"
   What things are you ambitious about?
  ","
  i'm ambitious when it comes to my relationships and my career. i'm always looking to progress one step forward regardless of where i am, and i value honesty and integrity when it comes to both personal and professional relationships.
  "
422054,"
   Would you rather become a person that you are proud of, or become a person that the one you love is proud of? Why?
  ","
  i feel as if they're one in the same, because my boyfriend would be proud of me for doing things that make me proud of myself -- he understands the value of self love and reassurance, and he's always an advocate for doing things that make you feel good about yourself.
  "
422055,"
   do you wear a white trash bag or a black one? I personally like the red strings type ;)

  black, naturally -- i need to keep my aesthetic strong.

   How do you handle repetitive questions (How old, single, etc.)? How frustrated do you get? My answers started thoughtful and relatively witty, and slowly degenerated to one or two words.
  ","
  if they're questions that can be easily answered by what's already in my bio, then i'll answer the question and also refer the person to my bio.
  
  however, i also know that my page is very active so obviously everyone isn't going to read all of my answers. so in that respect, i don't really mind the repetition.
  "
422057,"
   Are you addicted to being alive?
  ","
  nobody is addicted to being alive because such an addiction does not exist.
  "
422058,"
   What questions are on your inappropriate list
  ","
  inappropriate ones, obviously.
  
  i don't answer any intrusive questions that are about sex, my sex life, my trauma, etc etc.
  
  if it isn't a question you wouldn't ask a stranger on the street, then don't ask it to a stranger on the internet.
  "
422059,"
   At what point of the day do you feel the most accomplished?

  ","
  it doesn't phase me. i share birthdays with a lot of people.
  "
422061,"
   What are some red flags to you when you go on a date?
  ","
  it would be a red flag if the person i was dating was rude to the staff of the establishment we were visiting -- i have no patience for people who don't respect retail and food service workers.
  "
422062,"
   Rabbits are adorable.

  i agree !! however, i'm probably biased because i think most animals are cute.

422063,"
   Do you ace interviews
  ","
  i've only been on three interviews in my entire life, but i've been offered jobs from all three of them, so i guess i wasn't terrible.
  
  which is ironic because job interviews give me panic attacks, but i guess the hiring managers would never think that about me based on my conduct lol.

  i did. i graduated college with a 3.9 GPA.

422067,"
   it's lame to see someone over the age of 16 still listening to linkin park lol

   I'm still mad about Chester's death... It's so sad...
  ","
  i have so many emotions regarding his death. i've been angry, frustrated, in shock, grieving, depressed, broken, lost, and confused. he was my idol growing up, and he taught me how to survive in the chaotic world i was living in. i owe my life to chester.
  "
422069,"
   How many questions do you delete in a day?
  ","
  it depends on the day -- some days i get more bullshit than others. i usually delete racist propaganda, messages in other languages, and most messages that are statements instead of questions, as well as sexual questions.
  "
422070,"
   How do you imagine your wedding? How would you like to perfom it?
  ","
  i don't really think about my future wedding because that's so far in advance from now and i have more important goals right now than getting married.
  
  ideally, i would like for it to be small and low key, but i know it's going to have to be an elaborate party because of the size of my boyfriend's family.
  "
422071,"
   How would you define self-love?
  ","
  self love is the ability to be comfortable and confident in yourself, embracing your flaws and attributes and understanding that your needs will sometimes come first before other people's needs.
  
  practicing self love and self care include doing things that make you happy, recharged, and relaxed when you need to be, whether it's through taking a bath or reading a book or taking a day off from work to give yourself a chance to breathe.

  tomorrow, i'm going to work and then hopefully i'm going to see my boyfriend after work. my weekdays aren't really too spectacular.
  "
422076,"
   Being mentally ill yoursef and having some knowledge about it, can you easily tell if a person suffers from a mental illness based on their behavior?
  ","
  not generally, no. most people with mental illness function in society, so it's difficult to tell if someone struggles with mental illness based solely on appearance / behavior alone.
  "
422077,"
   Are people who use public transport poor in your opinion?
  ","
  that's an extremely harsh and misguided generalization -- there are dozens of reasons why people use public transportation, whether it's because they simply don't drive or because it's easier to use public transportation than to own a car.
  "
422078,"
   Do you like doing nothing?
  ","
  no -- i always have to be doing something in order to occupy myself, otherwise i become withdrawn and depressed. even if the things i'm doing are relaxing activities such as playing video games or watching a tv show, it's still something that takes my mind off of things and allows me to focus.
  "
422079,"
   Which is better; a long uneventful life or a short fulfilled life?
  ","
  i always believed in ""quality over quantity."" therefore, i think a short but fulfilling life would honestly be better because although you won't live as long, you made the most out of every day handed to you and created beautiful experiences and stories.
  "
422080,"
   What type of writing do you do? (Taken from bio)
  ","
  for work, i mainly write press releases and narratives for my company's clients, who are basically extremely accomplished individuals across the globe. i was also trained on writing newsletter features today, which is exciting because there's more creative freedom involved in those.
  
  aside from work, i write non-fiction articles for medium.com occasionally, usually about mental health and my experiences. unfortunately, i haven't written anything since last july.
  "
422081,"
   Did you like science in school?
  ","
  i actually really enjoyed science, and i was in all honors classes throughout high school -- i had taken AP biology, AP chemistry, and a forensics class through syracuse university.
  
  i liked forensics most of all because the subject matter was intriguing to me, especially learning about ballistics and blood splatter patterns. my teacher set up a crime scene as a final test and we had to determine what had happened, and we were graded based on our conclusions.
  "
422082,"
   How do recommendations affect on employment?
  ","
  if you have a recommendation from a previous employer, it looks better to hiring managers because you're being endorsed as reliable by someone who has worked with you in the past. depending on your resume, recommendations can make you stand out among other applicants.
  "
422083,"

  ","
  no, i think lightning is quite beautiful. i absolutely love thunderstorms.
  "
422085,"
   Is there anything that gives you freedom? What makes you feel free from everyday struggles?
  ","
  there isn't anything that makes me feel free from everyday struggles, but keeping busy does help keep my mind at bay -- whether it's through writing, being preoccupied with a tv show, playing video games, or catching up with a close friend.
  "
422086,"
   What cool gadgets do you own?
  ","
  i don't own any gadgets, since i'm not really into new technology. the only cool thing that i have which is sorta like a gadget is a nightlight that's an exact replica of the moon with three different light settings.

   What do you think is the best way to impress your crush?
  ","
  i haven't heard the phrase ""impress your crush"" since middle / high school, and i'm cringing.
  "
422089,"
   To what extent is society morally obligated to save heroin addicts?
  ","
  to the fullest extent -- addiction is a health care problem and to deny someone treatment because they're a drug addict is not only cruel, but it's morally wrong and goes against every code of ethics there is.
  
  drug addicts need medical treatment and support, not to be ostracized and ridiculed.
  "
422090,"
   What is the difference between love and lust?
  ","
  love is an intimate, emotional connection you share with someone on multiple levels. lust, on the other hand, is fueled by sexual desire based solely upon physical appearance.
  "
422091,"
   Do you think that pornography gives people the wrong impression about how love and sex should be?
  ","
  yes and no -- if someone is young and watches pvrn, they might get wrong ideas about how sex actually works because they're inexperienced themselves. pvrn is grossly inaccurate when it comes to sexual conduct, which can mislead and misinform a lot of people if they don't know any better.
  
  i don't think pvrn has any effect on how people perceive love because sex and love are two vastly different things.
  "
422092,"
   Do you believe in God or a god?
  ","
  no, i'm an athiest. i don't believe in any sort of higher power.
  "
422093,"
   Do you like to visit museums?
  ","
  i love visiting museums, but i haven't actually been to a museum in a very long time. i used to visit new york city and go to various exhibits, such as the ones in the museum of modern art and museum of natural history.
  "
422094,"
   How many tattoos do you have? do you want to get more?
  ","
  i have seven tattoos so far -- i eventually want to cover my entire body in tattoos. my next pieces are going to cover my right forearm and the back of my right arm.
  "
422095,"
   If you don't believe in God or Devil and heaven and Hell, what keeps you from doing bad things?
  ","
  you don't need to be religious in order to have a decent standard of morals. you can view scenarios as good or bad based on how they'll affect other people, with no influence from religion whatsoever.
  "
422096,"
   Do you like to go to places where there is service? I mean where other people take care of you like trim your nails, wash your hair, etc.
  ","
  i don't necessarily feel comfortable with people touching me, but i do get my hair colored professionally and get my nails professionally done occasionally, simply because they're trained to be proficient in those areas and can do them better than i can.
  "
422097,"
   Why don't you use capital letters at the start of a sentence?
  ","
  because i don't feel the need to properly capitalize or spell my words on the internet. i like the look of lowercase words better.
  "
422098,"
   is your boyfriend atheist
  ","
  yeah, he is. he was raised a christian, but he started doubting the existence of god when he was a teenager. he's an atheist these days.
  "
422099,"
   I've heard your voice. It's ok. Is there something about you that your not selfcouncious about?
  ","
  my eyes, my ability to put on makeup, my writing and research skills, etc etc.
  "
422100,"
   So why do you use the word hell if you don't believe in it?
  ","
  i don't remember the last time i actually used the word hell in a sentence (unless you can show me).
  
  either way, it's a hyperbole. a cliche expression. everyone uses the term hell to refer to something bad, it isn't really a big deal.
  "
422101,"
   Do you consider yourself funny and quick to come up with witty answers?
  ","
  not usually. sometimes i think of something witty, but it's rare.
  "
422102,"
   Do you think ask.fm is dead?
  ","
  no, it's still quite active (at least my feed is active). it's certainly not as active as it was last year since a lot of regulars left, but i wouldn't consider it to be dead yet.
  "
422103,"
   Do you feel unsafe where you live? What one thing would you like to change about your city?
  ","
  my region is fairly dangerous, so yeah, sometimes i do feel unsafe where i live. i carry a knife and whistle with me at all times, just in case someone were to try to jump me.
  
  i'd like to change the drug epidemic that's sweeping my county. heroin is the most popular drug here, and lately it's been laced with fentanyl, so it's extremely lethal. i've lost many people to heroin over the years.
  "
422104,"
   ? you just don't know me why this attacks ?

  i'm not attacking you. i'm merely stating that i don't have conversations with people on askfm, yourself included. for some reason, you can't take no for an answer.
  "
422105,"
   How do you decide which movie to watch?
  ","
  i watch things which capture my interest immediately -- usually gritty action films, psychological thrillers, and suspenseful dramas.
  "
422106,"
   Why should bring engaged be a surprise? Why can't it be a mutual decision? It's 2018.
  ","
  it can be a mutual decision while also being a surprise -- knowing the exact moment when someone is going to propose takes away all of the fun and surprise of getting engaged.
  
  you can know that you want to marry a person without knowing when they'll propose to you.
  "
422107,"
   will you get engaged this year?
  ","
  i can't exactly predict that, haha. if i knew, then that would take away the surprise.
  "
422108,"
   What did you do for his birthday?

422112,"
   What kind of things do you write/edit
  ","
  for my job, i edit press releases, magazine features, and other text related to my company's brand.
  
  i also write press releases for clients as well that are distributed on various PR websites. the CEO of the company wants more writing to be done in house (as opposed to remotely), so i'll be writing a lot more in the future !!
  "
422113,"
   Is the age 20 still considered  to be 20s?
  ","
  well, yeah -- you're not a teenager anymore, so it's only logical to consider a 20 year old to be in their 20s.
  "
422114,"
   What is your favorite language?
  ","
  the only language i know is english, unfortunately. however, i've always wanted to learn russian and latin.
  "
422115,"
   How do you express what words cannot?
  ","
  through music -- if i can't find a way to express myself through writing, then i'll resort to music in an effort to show others how i feel or put my emotions into a melody to make me feel less lonely.
  
  i should clarify that i don't make music myself, but i do listen to music every day and stand by the notion that there is a song for virtually every mood or circumstance.

422118,"
   Actually Leigh, it has everything to do with spirituality because it's the spirit that is sick from being attached to an ego.
  ","
  if you're going to keep carrying on like this, then i'll have no choice but to discontinue answering your statements. spirituality is not at all correlated with mental illness, because one is a matter of faith and the other is a matter of science.
  
  i'm not in the mood to listen to this sort of talk because i get the impression that you don't respect my beliefs, and i'm frankly tired of people discounting mental illness for what it truly is.
  "
422119,"
   I'm not discounting your experiences and resulting mental illness at all. I'm just saying that until you truly deal with how you are at the deepest level of your mind, then nothing will change for you.
  ","
  the way to treat mental illness is by taking medication and going to therapy, whether it's inpatient or outpatient procedures. to move on from my trauma, i have years of therapy to go through, because it's only through intensive CBT or DBT that i'll come to an understanding of my trauma, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and control my behavior.
  
  in addition, mental illness is mostly a chronic condition, and there are some mental illnesses that exist which afflict a person for their entire life. it can be treated and managed, but not eradicated completely. it's just the way psychology and physiology works, and it has no correlation with religion or spirituality.
  "
422120,"
   From the Buddhist perspective, your mental afflictions most likely come from a previous existence where they weren't dealt with in the appropriate way
  ","
  good thing i'm not a buddhist then. i'm 99% certain that my mental illnesses are a result of the 10+ years of abvse i endured, not because of some mindset that can't be substantiated by evidence.
  "
422121,"
   Would you want your spirit to continue after you've gone even if it was born into another body that has the same mental afflictions that you have now?
  ","
  i honestly have doubts about living the life i live now, so living another life after this one would honestly not be appealing to me.
  "
422122,"
   Did you have a crush on your bf before being with him?
  ","
  i absolutely did. he had one of those personalities that attracted me on a romantic level, and all i wanted to do was get to know him better and talk to him all the time. you could tell there was mystery behind his eyes, and i wanted to know everything about him.
  "
422123,"
   What would your life be like without a phone? Would it be better or worse? How long can you go without using your phone?
  ","
  i think my life would be more difficult and lonely if i didn't have a phone, because it means i wouldn't have access to social media, which helps me substantially when it comes to my mental health.
  
  i also wouldn't be able to talk to my friends as often, which in turn would make me believe that they hate me.
  "
422124,"
   What is your biggest fear?
  ","
  abandonment.
  "
422125,"
   How to handle ex friends? Two people I am no longer friends with are trying to assert themselves into my life by using a mutual friend. This friend was friends with them first, and then later befriended me. Now he wants me to talk to them, but I don't want to. What do I do?
  ","
  you're under no obligation to talk to people you're no longer friends with, regardless of whether or not you have a mutual friend. that mutual friend of yours needs to understand that you don't have to be friends with their friends in order to be friends with them (i hope that makes sense).
  "
422126,"
   Recently I asked a young woman on social media ""Are you legal?"" Her answer was ""way to word that in the creepiest way possible"" Do you understand how is it creepy? If, yes, can you please explain how was I wrong?

  it could be construed as ""creepy"" because it insinuates that you're interested in having sex with her and you want to make sure she's of legal age.

  "
422128,"
   i saw a mom whining about her 4 year old being disrespectful and ill mannnered. i know people need to vent sometimes but dont you think its really mean to write things like that about your child for the world to see? if you need help you can private msg someone you trust. why put it on social media?
  ","
  people use social media as a place to vent and receive validation, so by posting things that her child is doing, she probably was releasing her frustrations as well as expecting other mothers to relate to her experience.
  
  having an ill mannered child isn't really something unusual or a big deal, especially at that age. people are allowed to complain.
  "

   Do you smoke weed
  ","
  no, not really. i used to smoke a lot of weed in the past, but in recent years, it's only made me incredibly paranoid and i didn't like the way it made me feel.
  
  however, i'm interested in trying one of those new pens that are out now instead of smoking a traditional joint or bowl. it seems to be a lot smoother with better quality.

  when i'm angry, i do -- i tend to talk a lot faster and my accent slips out more, haha.

   Does the past determine the future? 

Does the future confirm the past?
  ","
  the past can determine the future in some cases, but only if you allow your past to dictate your life -- even though terrible things happen in people's pasts that undoubtedly change them, it's ultimately their decision as to whether or not they're going to try to move forward.
  "
422141,"
   Hope or despair? Which concept is more consolidating?
  ","
  despair is more consolidating, in my opinion. people relate to each other more when they've shared similar experiences in times of struggle or hardship, and often when tragedy occurs, people bind together to support one another.
  
  there's comfort in trying times because there will always be someone who will offer a helping hand. you're never alone, and that's a beautiful thing about humanity.
  "
422142,"

  sometimes it's hard to see at first because it may seem like the wrong choice, especially if someone gets hurt in the process -- but generally speaking, if the decision you made will ultimately improve your life or someone else's life in the long run, then it's the right choice.
  "
422157,"
   Is love alone enough to make a relationship work?

  no -- you need to to put in a lot of hard work to make a relationship last as well. if you love someone but don't put in the effort to show it or communicate your feelings with your partner, then your relationship might fail.

  "
422164,"

  not at all. my dad and i get along well, even though our relationship is distant. my mother is the one who has caused most of my problems in my life, and she's just a difficult person to live with in general.
  "
422168,"

  tapestries and string lights on the walls; big bay windows that shine natural light into the room; a reading nook with shelves for books; a king sized bed with a cozy, plush comforter and silky sheets; enough room for a fish tank and a big screen tv hooked up to my xbox; and paintings on the walls.

422170,"
   Do you trust your parents? Do they trust you?
  ","
  i assume that my parents trust me when it comes to most things -- however, the topic never comes up, so i can't be sure.
  
  i don't trust my mother, though. she's abvsed and gaslighted me for my entire life, so i never believe anything she says anymore.
  "
422171,"
   Do you believe venting and talking things through with a friend, even one you don't know too well, is an effective way to deal with some problems? Or does it fall into the gossip/complaining category of things?
  ","
  venting to someone who's willing to listen is extremely helpful when it comes to dealing with personal issues, as long as the person you're venting to is responsive to what you have to say and is willing to support you.
  
  it's one of the only methods of treatment for my mental illness, which is why i advocate so strongly for psychotherapy. being listened to and validated is important.

  "
422174,"
   Is it just me or is this annoying you text someone a massive  text and they just reply K

  "
422176,"
   Would it be important for you to incorporate emotional intimacy into your relationship with your mentor (career-wise)? Why?
  ","
  no -- i keep my relationships with my mentors / bosses strictly professional, as i find no reason to become emotionally involved with them. to become emotionally invested with a figure of authority in a work setting would only put my job at risk.
  "
422177,"
   If we could screen babies for psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies, should we? What should we do with the babies that are likely become psychopaths?
  ","
  people with psychotic disorders and antisocial personality disorder are just as deserving of compassion and treatment as those with other mental illnesses.
  
  there's no benefit to screening for such illnesses (not to mention it would be impossible anyway), and to suggest so is discriminatory toward people with those illnesses.
  "

  if i didn't enjoy smoking, then i simply wouldn't smoke.
  "
422179,"
   like when you're arguing with a person and that person thinks they're better than you, but they are broke and you have more money than them
  ","
  yeah, that would be incredibly rude if you used their financial status against them like that. how much money a person does or doesn't have doesn't dictate whether they're right or wrong in a situation. it's inconsiderate of you to behave in this manner.
  "

  "
422183,"
   Would you like to have a large white wedding or a small informal gathering?
  ","
  i'd much rather have an informal, whimsical gathering of close friends and family. weddings are too expensive these days and place the couple in too much debt, and i would like to avoid that if possible.
  
  my boyfriend and i don't need a huge, fancy wedding to prove our love for one another. i much prefer the look of small, quaint, outdoor weddings anyway.

  "
422196,"
   if children misbehave and throw fits at the store because they dont get what they want, do you assume they arent being raised well?
  ","
  not necessarily -- it's common nature for most children to act out in public, regardless of the way they've been raised. you can't expect a child to behave like a little angel all of the time, especially considering how much stimuli exists in most public places.
  
  what can indicate toward bad parenting is the way the parent reacts to their child acting out.

  "
422199,"
   Who do you go out of your way to be nice to?

  my family, tbh. i'm nice to them to keep the peace and to prevent arguments from breaking out, because it's a lot easier to lie and be nice to certain people than it is to say how you truly feel, unfortunately.

  i know a part of recovery is acceptance, but how can i accept that this shit happened to me when it's contributed to my fucked up behavior and relationships and impulsive and self destructive habits and my desire to end my life all the time? how can i accept that? it's made me so angry and depressed and anxiety ridden and i can't control it anymore.

  people are allowed to have different opinions as long as they're not discriminatory to a group of people. the idea of calling someone a snowflake is juvenile in my opinion, because people often use the term to describe others whose opinions are simply different than theirs.
  
  however, there are also a lot of people who find offense in literally anything, so sometimes i can understand why people who use that term so openly feel the need to use it.

  i often question this myself, lol. i think askfm is inherently addictive, and i've never been able to deactivate permanently over the course of the years i've been active here. i like the questions i receive and i like keeping up on my friends' answers, so that's a major component as to why i haven't left askfm.

422272,"
   What do you think about people who argue for assigned gender-role toys?
  ","
  i honestly think it's silly -- toys shouldn't be gender specific, and there's nothing wrong with a boy playing with dolls or a girl playing with hot wheels. it doesn't determine which gender they are and develop into as they get older, and i think it's a trivial thing for parents to argue about.
  "
422273,"
   What do you think about people that assume that your life needs to be in chronological order (i.e. graduation-marriage-children) in order to be successful?

  i think it's an archaic way of thinking and everyone's idea of success is different and very subjective. in today's society, it's much more difficult for people to get a college education, if they want to pursue college to begin with, and there's more pressure on young adults to get married and have children.

   Do you think that our use of phones and the internet is making us more insular especially towards each other in public spaces?

  no, i think that the use of social media and the internet spreads greater awareness and understanding of cultures other than our own. social media and the internet makes it easier for people to share cultural practices and teach others about the world that exists other than their own.

   How many of you read another’s bio when you go to their page on here? What about any other site where bios are a thing?

   Do you think it's rude if someone you're talking to suddenly answers their phone in the middle of a conversation?
  ","
  yeah, definitely -- especially if they don't say ""excuse me"" before they take the call. i can understand if someone was waiting on an important phone call, but it's courteous to let the other person know beforehand that they might be on the phone at some point.

   why do you like cis women but not trans women?

422293,"
   But isn't poor self esteem also egotistical?

  "
422296,"
   Why do we fear death do you think?
  ","
  it falls under the same idea as fear of the unknown -- death is an unknown entity for most people, and it strikes fear into those who simply don't know what to expect after this life. death also raises the question of whether or not this life is even worth living in the first place, which can be a frightening thought to people.

  AHH I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU, TEA IS AMAZING.
  
  it depends on which kinds of tea you prefer !! there's black tea, green tea, white tea, and herbal teas. i personally prefer various black and green teas, but there are also really good herbal teas out there as well.
  
  for starters, i would suggest trying out earl grey tea (black tea) because it has a nice bold flavor and you can put in sugar and milk, which makes it taste lovely. there are also a plethora of flavored green teas ; i personally like green tea with jasmine and green tea with lemon. however, there are countless other combinations that you can find if you go to your local grocery store, just pick a box that sounds yummy.
  
  there are also dozens upon dozens of herbal teas, like peach and raspberry and blueberry, as well as various chai teas (which have spices in them, so good). it's really all a matter of experimentation and finding your taste. i think the best option for you would be finding a box of variety teas instead of buying single boxes of one flavor !! that way you save money and can try out different flavors.

   How do you differentiate between sadness and depression? Especially, when you don't have the money to make an appointment with a specialist.
  ","
  sadness usually has a reason behind it -- you're stressed out, someone passed away, you lost a friend, work has been rough, etc etc. it goes away relatively fast.
  
  depression is long lasting and doesn't need to have a reason. depression is defined by periods of sadness, fatigue, lack of interest in activities, loss of focus, svicidal thoughts, etc. to be diagnosed with depression, you must have a certain amount of symptoms (i think two or three) every day for at least two weeks.

  i usually only answer questions on my phone, as i'm rarely on my laptop.
  
  a few years ago, askfm wasn't available on mobile, so answering questions on the computer was the only option we had. however, i do prefer it on the phone now because the layout makes it extremely easy to sort through & answer questions, and i can do it virtually any time of day.
  "
422436,"
   Okay, I think I see where you are getting lost, see what you are calling ""facts"" and ""literally documented in history"" are based on feelings. When something is based on the assumption of a feeling, it's a feeling. It's not a fact.
  ","
  i can understand where you're getting lost too, and it's a shame that we can't come to a formal agreement.
  
  something that has been shared by millions of people is more than just a ""feeling."" considering you're cis, you wouldn't understand this yourself, but being trans is more than just a ""feeling."" it's someone's entire world, the definition of their being, something so significant that it dictates whether they live or die. the idea that so many people share these experiences, in so many different cultures, and throughout different time periods, assumes that being trans is more than just a fleeting ""feeling.""
  
  it's clear that you're not going to understand the intricacies of being trans, however. we're just going in circles.
  "
422437,"
   Are you just agreeing with anything now?

  i wasn't aware that i was blindly agreeing to anything -- silly me.
  
  is this in response to the fat question? my response wasn't a lie, if that's what you're wondering.
  "
422438,"
   And I'm pointing out the facts. Just because you think you are something, don't mean you are something. Even stuff you are trying to pass off as facts, are actually based on feelings.  ""gender identity has existed for centuries"". You understand thats not fact, right? It's still feelings, not a fact.
  ","
  if you've done any research at all, you would know that it's literally documented in history than genders aside from man and woman have existed for centuries. facts are based upon historical data and evidence -- if you took the time out of your day to research this evidence instead of having a debate with a stranger, you would clearly see that.

  "
422442,"
   Okay, you got lost in the analogy. So, we'll take it one step at a time and see where you go wrong.Step 1. You are a female that thinks she's not a girl, right?
  ","
  this condescending attitude is quite sickening, and i honestly believe you should educate yourself on trans culture before you think you can talk to a trans person as if you know them better than they know themselves.
  
  it doesn't matter to me what *you* think i am -- because it simply isn't the truth. so whether you would like to accept that truth or not, i'm still who i am at the end of the day.
  "
422443,"
   Incorrect. I can explain extremely easily, why you're wrong. If a person thinks a wall is talking to them. Is the wall really talking to them? Of course not. Trans is a mental health disorder. Pretending otherwise is just foolishness. You can't change your gender, just like you can't change your age
  ","
  ""i can explain why you're wrong, so here's a completely random analogy that makes no logical sense in comparison to what i'm talking about and citing a myth that has no scientific basis and hasn't been included in mental health discussions since the 1970s""
  "
422444,"
   “Facts don’t care about your feelings” gosh  I’m sick of that quote
  ","
  it's honestly just a useless and childish way of trying to invalidate someone's identity and experiences -- perhaps if anon was actually talking about something that *wasn't* based on scientific evidence, then i would understand their justification.
  
  but gender identity has existed for centuries, and unfortunately those who oppose trans people have brainwashed themselves to believe that trans people have only existed in the past 10 years out of cultural spite instead of educating themselves on trans culture.
  "
422445,"
   I don't go for that feelings PC bullshit. Facts don't care about your feelings, there are only 2 genders. You're a girl. What episode of X Files?
  ","
  if we're talking scientific facts, then you'll be delighted to know that gender identity is a very valid and real thing, existing for centuries in a plethora of cultures on anthropological, sociological, psychological, and biological levels. you can't simply disrespect trans individuals because you don't agree with the reality of the world.
  
  needless to say, there are more than two genders because your gender identity isn't equivalent to your biological sex. you're correct in that i'm biologically female, but i've never identified as a girl, nor will i ever.

   my mom is really indiscreet about my mental issues, she tells all of our relatives and family friends and I asked her to stop because it's putting me in an awkward position, I don't know why she does that, she might not realize it's hurting me, I'm not comfortable w people knowing my issues
  ","
  i can understand that -- my family does the same thing with the information they do know, which is why i don't tell them about my diagnoses other than depression / anxiety.

  ","
  if i was single, then i would thank him for the compliment and tell him i'm not interested in dating, so i wouldn't be giving him my number.
  
  when i was single, i usually had no intentions of entering a relationship and pretty much wanted nothing to do with men. my relationship with my boyfriend was different because we ended up being good friends first before dating one another, so it felt more natural and it wasn't forced.

  i'm tired of mentally ill people using their diagnoses (or self diagnoses, in most cases) to excuse their malicious or manipulative behavior.
  
  your diagnosis is an EXPLANATION of your tendencies, not an EXCUSE for you to allow yourself to continue fulfilling those tendencies.
  
  if you're aware of your shitty behavior and brush it off as ""oh it's a symptom of my xyz syndrome, i can't help it,"" then you're AWARE that what you're doing is wrong and you're not doing anything to stop it.
  
  take accountability for your actions and stop blaming your mental illness for your shitty behavior. it adds to the stigma associated with a lot of illnesses and makes other sufferers look bad.

  secret santa is when a group of people put their names on a piece of paper in a bowl, and everyone picks a paper. the person whose name is on the paper is the person you have to purchase a gift for. most groups usually have a limit as to how much to spend, whether it's $10 or $25.

   Does snow scare you when you drive? Is it safe to drive?
  ","
  i'm terrified to drive while it's snowing - which is why i got a ride to my best friend's mother's house today instead of driving myself. however, after it's done snowing and the roads have been cleared, i'm usually okay.
  
  snow is safe to drive in under certain circumstances - i.e. the roads are adequately plowed, you have the right tires to drive in snowy weather, you know how to handle yourself in case roads get slippery, etc etc.
  
  the problem is that most roads aren't plowed adequately, which makes it extremely unsafe for people to drive in snowy weather. especially in places like the southern US; they're not used to getting snow so they're not given the proper tools to make the roads safe to drive.

  there isn't a universal answer to this question, so it depends entirely on the people in the relationship.
  
  some people are ready for marriage when they're 19, others aren't ready until they're 30, and some people aren't interested in marriage at all. it's entirely subjective.
  
  if you can see yourself with your partner for the long haul, can deal with their flaws and quirks and bad habits, and / or can see them as a parent (if you're interested in having kids), then you may be ready for marriage.

  "
422631,"

  ","
  from my understanding, it's usually because the bullies often have dysfunctional home lives and never learned how to express their anger and frustration properly except through fear and violence - it's a power trip, bullies like having the sense of being in control because they usually have no control over problems at home.

  i'm against the death penalty. i think it's a barbaric means of justice and it doesn't teach the criminal a lesson regarding their behavior - it's essentially the easy way out. it's an antiquated means of punishment.

  yes, definitely - men are conditioned into thinking that they should suppress their emotions because it wouldn't be ""manly"" to express them, especially feelings like love and sadness. it's something that needs to change in society, especially with respect to mental health. men who have mental illness are less likely to seek out treatment because of the stigma, and in turn, there are higher rates of svicide among men than there are among women.

  i understand this completely - i have a tendency to self isolate when i'm depressed, which in turn only makes me more depressed because i feel guilty for trying to talk to someone about my feelings, knowing i pushed them away beforehand.

  in most cases, no - there isn't a valid reason. in otherwise healthy relationships, there's no reason why you can't sit down with your partner and end the relationship if you're not interested in them anymore or feel the need to pursue someone else.
  
  however, that being said, i think the exception is when a person is in an abusive relationship, and the only way to get away from their partner is by seeing someone else (or if someone else is a major source of comfort, whatever the reason may be). sometimes it can be dangerous for someone to try to end an abusive relationship without proper help.

  i don't think it's disrespectful at all - it's normal in a healthy relationship to feel comfortable with your partner pleasuring themselves if you're not in the mood or aren't around, and vice versa.

  i highly disagree. coming from a perspective where i have my own SH scars, people shouldn't feel ashamed of their scars because they're a part of you like any other part of your body, and they're indicative that you're winning your battle against mental illness because you're still alive.
  
  no one would judge a person for having physical scars from a physical illness, so why judge a person for having physical scars from a mental illness? society should ideally be more understanding of mental illness in general, including the scars we've garnered through our struggles.

  if $200 isn't in your budget, you should talk to your brother and inform him that you don't have that kind of money on you - if he's understanding, i'm sure he won't mind because overall it's the thought that counts, not the number associated with the item(s).

  sorry it took me so long to respond to you !! however, your feelings are valid and you shouldn't feel guilty at all - even though you're happier now, your depression was still very real and obviously severe. i suggest that you continue going to therapy because it's evidently helping, and you may fall back into a depression if you decided to stop (maybe, but the risk is always there).

  you have to remind yourself that things are in the past, and for that reason, they cannot be changed. there's no productive reason to regret past mistakes because there's nothing you can do to change the outcome of those scenarios.

  this is something you need to resolve with your boyfriend - asking people for opinions online won't help because we don't know your boyfriend, and therefore, can't gauge his response.

   Space to rant about a topic that highly interests you.
  ","
  they whole #metoo hashtag that's been trending currently has brought to light the magnitude of sexual harassment and assault in today's world - nearly every woman i know has experienced one or the other, and i've found so much strength in friends and acquaintances who are willing to share their stories.
  
  however, nobody is obligated to tell their story and their story isn't owed to anyone at all. if someone is uncomfortable revealing their sexual harassment or assault, then they shouldn't be shamed for remaining quiet. for each person who talks about their experiences, there's likely nine more people who are too afraid to share.
  
  the same goes for men as well. men aren't immune from sexual harassment or assault, and often they're shamed for revealing their stories. the stigma that exists around this topic needs to end and something needs to be done to prevent its prevalence.

  today, i'm on the right dose of medication and have been engaged in consistent mental health treatment. i've learned how to discuss my feelings and reach out when i'm feeling down. i'm moving forward in my career and in my relationships. although i still have bad days, they're not nearly as bad as how they were a year ago.

   its normal to feel nervous and anxious in a new job. why do some people (& i dont mean you) want to make out normal emotions/reactions are some sort disorder. i see normal anxiety treated this way and it annoys me.
  ","
  i haven't had much IRL experience with people doing those sorts of things, but i do notice that type of behavior on the internet - normal reactions and behaviors being played out as some sort of mental illness.
  
  unfortunately, being mentally ill has become some sort of a sick trend, and people are quick to self diagnose typical moods and feelings when they're not actually abnormal.
  
  i used to have panic attacks everyday when i was trying to adjust to change - that was an aspect of my panic disorder, and now i take medication to prevent that from happening. but feeling regular anxiety over big changes is common and expected; it isn't indicative of any disorders.

  there's so much stigma surrounding the gay community, and on top of that, men are bombarded with the idea that they ""should"" be masculine. complimenting another man is unfortunately seen as something that detracts from their masculinity, so if a man is insecure with their sexuality or the way they present themselves, they might add that ""no homo"" modifier.
  
  complimenting another person obviously doesn't mean that you're gay, but there's so much hypermasculinity in society that men are forced to think that any recognition of attractive attributes is automatically a gay thought. it isn't.

422984,"
   So your basically saying that god was disrespecting people just because he was preaching??? That’s not forcing people to follow him that’s called preaching. It’s very different from forcing people to believe.
  ","
  preaching to a choir means that you're relaying your beliefs to a group of people who have the same belief system as you. that's not inherently wrong.
  
  however, preaching to someone who knowingly doesn't have the same beliefs as you is disrespectful. it doesn't matter whether your god preached to his followers or not because that's irrelevent to the conversation.

  one of the biggest misconceptions is that those who are mentally ill are inherently dangerous to those around them, especially people diagnosed with psychotic or dissociative disorders.

  if you're not hitting on someone of the same sex or find someone of the same sex to be sexually or romantically attractive, then no, you're not bi or a lesbian.

  my current company is laying off 90% of its employees in december, so i've had no choice but to find a new job. i also wanted to find a new job before my insurance expires in november so that i could apply for health insurance as soon as possible.
  
  as for my new job, i'm going to be doing editorial work for a publishing company.

  i only have perhaps 2 or 3 true friends, and they would remain regardless of what happens. i tend to keep my inner circle really small because i don't trust most people, and these friends have proven their love and loyalty throughout the years.

   What does the anonymous person even mean with ''stop misinforming people''?
  ","
  probably because i said ""happy national coming out day"" and they thought i meant that it was a federal holiday or something wacky like that.
  
  i always take this anon's messages with a grain of salt because they're always offended by what i say and the only insults they come up with is calling me a ""snowflake"" and alleging that i plagiarize my own answers.
  "
423021,"
   There's no such thing as a ""national coming out day"" snowflake. There's nothing official. So stop misinforming people, and stick to what you do best: cut, copy, paste, rearrange, you now, plagiarize?
  ","
  even though it's not an ""official"" holiday doesn't mean that people can't celebrate it for what it is - to deny that it exists is just plain silly.
  
  as for how i answer my questions, i can assure you that none of my answers are plagiarized - if you can't accept that for what it is, then that's not necessarily my problem.
  "
423022,"
   lmao. yeah, i was being picky but thats only because, as a straight woman, i'm sick of ppl saying ""everyone's a little bit gay"". like piss off with your shit. its patronising to gay ppl imo. i adore my gal pals and think women in general are fabulous but i'm straight.
  ","
  i never said that everyone's a little bit gay - i just said that i was gay, considering it's national coming out day and i don't advertise my sexuality at all.
  
  i agree with you, though - you can appreciate women without being sexually attracted to them obviously, they're two completely different spectrums.
  "
423023,"
   Yeah, a friend of mine came out to his very strict, macho military dad and he was all ""you have to accept me or I'm cutting you out of my life"". And I'm like chill a bit and let him get used to the idea, I mean he probably had visions of you getting married to a woman etc. Let him adjust.
  ","
  i agree. and hopefully his father does accept him for who he is - i can't even fathom the thought process someone goes through when deciding they're not going to treat someone the same simply because their friend or family member came out as gay.
  "
423024,"
   What do you think of the fact that you need to pay lots of many for a psychiatrist (in most countries)?
  ","
  i think it's sad, tbh. a lot of people require mental health treatment but ultimately go without it due to the expensive cost of psychiatry visits, medication, talk therapy, hospitalizations, etc etc.
  
  even with insurance - depending on your insurance company - the cost of taking care of your mental health can be taxing.
  "

  ","
  i think i remember hearing about this story briefly. i don't think it's fair at all - he shouldn't have any rights to that child because it was non-consensual sex and that girl shouldn't have to see her rvpist all of the time because it only raises the risk of it happening again.

423034,"
   how come someone as intelligent as you destroy her own lungs

  ","
  when i started dating him, i was an extremely guarded person because i was hurt so often in the past due to other relationships. i didn't really expect the relationship to last very long because we began dating a few months before i moved to massachusetts for college.
  
  however, we both persisted at the long distance relationship and i was amazed at how much effort he was putting into making sure we talked every day, and he was there for me completely when i began dissolving into a severe depressive episode. it was during that time that i fell in love with him because he showed me support and understanding and persistence that i've never experienced before.
  "

  people with strong, bold personalities - people who aren't afraid to voice their opinions and embrace their individuality with full force.
  
  my boyfriend is one of those kinds of people. he has strong opinions but only offers them if asked. he likes playing the devil's advocate to challenge other people's opinions. he's not afraid to tell people his honest feelings, and he's well aware of how weird and geeky he is and embraces it completely.

   What's one lesson life has taught you?
  ","
  don't trust people just because they're offering you something you need at the time.
  
  when i was younger, i was naive enough to trust certain people because they were giving me something i wanted, and i thought they had my best interests in mind. it turns out they were just using me to advance their own gains, so i immediately cut them out of my life. these days, it takes a lot of time and effort for someone to gain my trust because i don't trust in other people's motives.
  "
423060,"
   Is there any moments where you felt alone in your life?
  ","
  unfortunately, that's a common side effect of depression: unwavering loneliness, regardless of the support system behind you.
  
  even though i've had support throughout the years, i still have moments where i feel desperately alone and as if no one understands and nothing will get better. depression is an isolating disorder because it makes loneliness feel like your only friend and forces you to distance yourself from people who actually care about you.
  "
423061,"
   Would you rather blend in or stand out?
  ","
  i'd rather just be myself, whether that means i'm blending into the crowd or standing out from the crowd.
  
  i've always found it difficult to define myself, but i've always sought to live my life on my own terms rather than live my life according to what society expects of me. as a result, there are some aspects of me where i do blend in, but i also stand out in other aspects too. it's difficult to really define.
  "
423062,"
   Has a movie ever made you cry? If yes, which one?
  ","

423063,"
   Do you believe in anything paranormal/supernatural?
  ","
  i believe in the paranormal, like ghosts and spirits and whatnot. i've had a few experiences with ghosts that solidified my opinion, as there was no other explanation for the things i saw.
  
  i also really enjoy watching paranormal shows. i think some of them are exaggerated, but they're interesting to watch.

  i'm not self-centered at all, and most of the time, i actually hate myself, lol.
  
  my life mainly centers around my friends and boyfriend. however, i've also been trying to do things for myself as well because my therapist has been teaching me the value of self-care and kindness.
  "
423065,"
   What are you pretending not to know?
  ","
  i'm fairly honest with myself, so there's nothing i'm pretending not to know. it's better to be aware of your environment and relationships instead of living in denial. you're not doing yourself any favors by refusing to acknowledge if there's a problem in your life.
  "
423066,"
   I know it's dumb to ask this on ask fm but is it weird that I want to keep the curtains in my room closed, bc I don't want people outside to see me?

  "
423067,"
   It’s been ages since I sent this question out, so I thought I’d repeat it to see if your answers have changed. What topics do you like to receive questions about here? What topics, if any, do you not want to discuss?
  ","
  i think my answers are generally the same whenever you ask this question because my interests don't really change much over time.
  
  i like receiving personal questions most of all - questions about mental illness, my relationships and friendships, my education, career, opinions, passions, life goals, etc.
  
  the only questions i don't answer are ones pertaining to my trauma, my family, and anything sexually-based.
  "
423068,"
   do you think there are people who are mentally ill but they don't know it or refuse to accept it?
  ","
  i'm sure that's actually quite common, actually. mental illness often goes undiagnosed because a lot of people have a lack of insight into their own mental health due to a lack of education about illnesses.
  
  in the same vein, i'm also sure there are thousands of people who refuse to accept the fact that they have a mental illness due to the stigmas surrounding them or their belief that being mentally ill is a weakness of character.
  "
423069,"
   Ever had your past held against you?Do you think peoples pasts should be held against them?
  ","
  i've had my past held against me plenty of times. i used to do a lot of dumb shit with my friends and manipulated people for the fun of it, and it was a pretty terrible thing for me to do. there are some people who still judge me for what i did and hold it against me, and to be honest, i don't blame them at all.
  "
423070,"
   Are you looking forward to tomorrow?
  ","
  somewhat, but not really. i didn't make any plans because i have a lot of laundry to do and some household chores to take care of throughout the day.
  
  today was my day to relax and have fun. my boyfriend had off from work, so we spent last night through this afternoon together.
  "
423071,"
   How often do you judge yourself?
  ","
  i judge myself every day - it correlates with my self esteem issues because i judge myself for not doing anything in my life to better myself despite being unhappy with a myriad of things.
  "
423072,"
   Do you live in a close knit community? Do your neighbours help each other out, or do you all go about your lives and rarely bother with one another?
  ","
  my neighborhood is anything but closely knit, and we live our lives without knowing who the other people are or what they do with their lives. i live in a populated town, so it's not as if it's a small community of people who all know each other.
  "
423073,"
   What kind of nature is mist beautiful to you?
  ","
  all nature is beautiful to me; i'd take living in the mountains over living in a city any day.
  
  i'm surrounded by beaches and forests, so naturally i love those aspects of nature. however, i do have a strong appreciation for mountains and lakes.
  "
423074,"
   What kind of books do you like?
  ","
  i usually gravitate towards psychological thrillers, autobiographies, and fantasy novels.
  
  i just finished one of my favorite books called 'i am not a serial killer' by dan wells, and its a good crossover between fantasy and thriller. i highly recommend it.

  ","
  i don't think we would have the same kind of relationship as we do now if i knew he didn't see marriage in the future.

   ""often violent crimes are committed with stolen guns, which isn't really affected by greater gun control"" this makes no sense? greater gun control means less guns therefore less guns capable of being stolen

  trust, understanding, and the ability to have fun. you can't hold a proper relationship if you don't trust your partner, and in order to have effective communication, there must be a degree of understanding between you and your partner.
  
  in addition, your partner should be your best friend. you should be able to talk to them without judgment, have fun with them while doing the simplest of things, and know that they'll be there for you through times of struggle.

"
423090,"
   What do you mean by ""nonbinary""?
  ","
  non-binary means that a person's gender is not defined by one of the either binary genders, which is man or woman. because gender exists on a spectrum, people who are non-binary feel as if they're somewhere in the middle of that spectrum in that they cannot be properly defined as a man or as a woman.
  "
423091,"
   What are your beliefs?
  ","
  some of my beliefs are:
  
  - women should have the option to choose abortions.
  
  - marijuana should be legalized / taxed, and medical marijuana should be more accessible for medical conditions.
  
  - the death penalty should be eradicated.
  
  - birth control should be covered by insurance companies.

  "
423094,"
   Why do you think ""this wave of feminism"" is ""more like a trend than a social movement""?
  ","
  it seems as if people would rather talk about feminist principles on social media instead of going out to marches, rallies, etc., to actually make a difference.
  
  there are a select few individuals who are so committed that they *do* go out to make a difference, but the majority of people don't do that.

   Am I a bad person for criticizing ""loose"" women? It has nothing to do with sexism, I am a female, I believe in equality but I also believe in decency and self-respect. If you act like a hoe, men are entitled to treat you like one.
  ","
  other people's sex lives shouldn't be your concern, and it's disheartening to hear that you're so invested in someone else's life - someone who probably means nothing to you - to the point where you're judging the content of their character based on their sexual history.
  
  i wouldn't necessarily call you a ""bad"" person, but i do believe you need an attitude adjustment. men aren't entitled to treat women like garbage just because they may have had an extensive sexual history. if you genuinely believed in gender equality, then you would treat these women with the same respect you would treat reserved women.

  trust me, i understand completely how you feel. my boyfriend is the same way -- he's good looking, intelligent, and charming -- so it's hard for me to really believe that he chose *me* out of the pool of available people. he always tells me that i'm attractive, but i honestly don't see it and i disagree with him.
  
  however, that doesn't mean your boyfriend doesn't love you or feels sorry for you. often our perceptions of ourselves are different than reality, and everyone has different taste. he probably genuinely feels that way towards you, but because you can't see it, you think that he can't be telling the truth.

  i have tattoos that hold meaning and tattoos that hold no meaning. for example, my linkin park tattoo is extremely meaningful to me because the band saved my life when i was a teenager, and their music has always been a source of support growing up.
  
  on the other hand, my coffee tattoo is fairly meaningless as it's just an indication of my love for coffee. however, it's an amazing tattoo and i'n still so enthralled by it.

  a lot of people these days like to join in with the herd and mimic opinions without fully considering the facts, and it's unfortunate that people don't know how to do their own independent research anymore.

  a person's ability to ask someone out on a date isn't dependent on their sex or gender. if you want to ask someone out on a date, then go ahead and ask them.

  ","
  i don't really align myself with feminism anymore. i obviously still believe that everyone should have equal rights regardless of sex, gender, race, orientation, religion, etc., but the modern feminism movement has become extreme over the past few years, and i don't want to associate with it.
  "
423193,"
   Do you love or hate yourself?
  ","
  this is a complicated question to ask me because i simultaneously love and hate myself. i love certain aspects of myself while i despise other aspects, which creates a lot of turbulence in my self-esteem. some days i could feel satisfied with who i am, while other days i hate myself for who i am.

  ","
  i'm a supporter of the original ideas of feminism, but i believe that modern feminism (e.g., 2000-present) has derailed the original intentions of feminism and has turned the movement into somewhat of a joke.
  
  which is sad to me, because feminism has always been an obviously good cause and we still need to develop in the way society treats women and other oppressed groups. but modern movements in the name of feminism largely adds to the ongoing problem.

  i don't think i'm qualified to speak on behalf of people with DID since i'm not diagnosed with DID, but what i can say is that people with DID are *not* inherently violent like the media makes them out to be.
  
  every single media product that portrays DID puts them in a violent light, whether they're a serial killer or a murderer or just a generally manipulative person. in reality, that's not the case at all and people with DID deserve respect and privacy just like anyone else. DID is one of the most highly stigmatized illnesses.

  the only reason i can get away with coloring my hair at home is because my hair is short so i know i'm able to get to every single strand, haha. when my hair was longer, i would either have a friend color my hair or do it at the salon because i didn't trust myself.
  
  getting dye on your face or ears isn't generally a big deal though because it washes off in the shower when you rinse your hair after you color it. some people recommend putting petroleum jelly around your forehead prior to coloring, but i've never cared enough to do it myself.

  as for conditioner, veganese is great. it's a light conditioner so it doesn't weigh your hair down and leaves it squeaky clean.

   Is it ok to diagnose yourself online if you can't see a therapist. Do you think reading online will help how to cope?

  it depends on what you're diagnosing yourself with and where you're getting your information from. i don't agree with self-diagnosing complex disorders like personality disorders because the diagnostic criteria is specific and can mimic a combination of other disorders that only a trained professional can recognize. in addition, i wouldn't recommend joining support groups online because it might be seen as infiltrating the community.
  
  however, if you're diagnosing yourself with depression or anxiety, i think that's fine because they're extremely common and easy to recognize. it's also good to seek out support groups online for those sorts of things as well.

  i always knew that i didn't really identify with being a typical ""girl"" ever since i was a pre-teen, but i never really knew about trans / nonbinary identities until a few years ago, thanks to the internet.

  as for strangers, i don't correct others because i'm not out to most people and i present as very feminine to the public, so i would rather not go through the confusion of people saying, ""you're not actually trans."" so i let it slide most of the time.

  it's perfectly normal to have arguments with your partner - you're obviously not going to agree on everything, and that's to be expected. what's more important, however, is how you resolve those arguments and come to an understanding of each other's feelings. if you're going to bed angry and ignoring each other after the argument instead of coming to a compromise, then that may be unhealthy for your relationship and cause long-term damage.

  i believe texting while driving should be illegal - it's a distraction for the driver because they're not 100% focused on the road, and even if you are keeping your eyes on the road every two seconds, your brain isn't wired to take in that much information at once - there's going to be a deficit in something, and most of the time, that deficit is in your ability to be aware of your surroundings.

  i understand completely how you feel tbh - my life wasn't exactly wonderful either and i don't remember 99% of my childhood, and the parts i *do* remember aren't exactly the best of memories. so when people come up to me and ask me if i remember ___ and scoff when i tell them no, it does make me a bit angry because i've always felt as if i was """"cheated"""" out of a childhood.
  
  it's easy to feel sorry for yourself in those scenarios, but you have to remember that you're more than what happened to you as a child. use your memories to build a better life for yourself, a life that child-you would have wanted because you deserve to create happy memories.

  ""Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don't blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being ""in love"", which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.""

  i suppose it all depends on what your definition of success is - whether success means how much money you make on a yearly basis or how happy you are / how happy you make other people feel.
  
  for me personally, kindness is more important - i would rather live my life knowing that i've changed someone's life for the better than to simply have a boatload of money with no substantial impact whatsoever. bringing other people joy makes me feel as if my life has value, so that's much more important to me.

  we always make the best memories when it's just the two of us, and all we have to our names are our bodies, a small carry-on bag, and no responsibilities for the time being. it's in those moments where we can say we're actually happy for a change.

  public breastfeeding -  there are still so many people out there who believe that public breastfeeding is 'disgusting' and 'unnecessary,' when in reality, it shouldn't be stigmatized at all.
  
  breastfeeding is a normal and natural means of feeding a child - the idea that some people have to do it in public because their child is hungry shouldn't be seen as taboo, and there should be more acceptance everywhere. a person shouldn't have to hide in their car or in a bathroom stall to simply feed their child.

  askfm from 1/2 years ago was wonderful, and it was filled with interesting people who had so much education to offer. late 2016-2017 has been rather dull, but i believe lately it's been picking up speed because some old users have returned, and there are other new users who are educated and interesting and give good responses to questions.

  this is something i've never considered before, but yes - i believe that would be a good idea.
  
  obviously some books aren't suitable for children or teenagers, and it's important that there's some sort of warning on the book that it contains explicit or adult content. books are media just like any other form of entertainment, and there are some concepts which are too mature for children / teenager eyes.

  ","
  i smiled today because it was my co-worker's 29th birthday, and i was happy for her because she was leaving work 4 hours early to celebrate her birthday with her family.
  
  i bought her a badass card that had george washington riding a shark on the front, and a bottle of bacardi, which she absolutely loved, so it made me happy knowing that she enjoyed the gifts i got for her.

   How often do you need to look for encouragement or inspiration?
  ","
  as someone who requires constant reassurance and validation, i look for encouragement / inspiration on a near daily basis. i require consistent reminders that what i'm doing is worth the effort and is building towards a more important end goal, otherwise i feel as if everything i do is meaningless and it leads me to having panic attacks and crises.

   When you are on one side of the political spectrum than a friend and they are unable to change their opinion on something you find absolutely crucial, do you ditch the friendship or keep the friend and seethe at their beliefs?
  ","
  i think it depends entirely on what the opinion is, but if it's something crucial that i'm passionate about, i probably wouldn't be able to continue the friendship as i wouldn't be able to look at the person in the same light as i did before.
  
  i.e., if a friend of mine starting spouting off homophobic / transphobic nonsense, then i probably would have to re-think our friendship because at that point, that crosses the line between something that is simply an 'opinion' and something that's considered an injustice.

   Questions to all: What causes people who seem so able to attract love, to be so unable to take it in? What are some of the underlying reasons for their behavior? What are some of the underlying reasons that they turn away from safe emotional havens and genuinely offered security?
  ","
  people who are not used to being genuinely loved and cared for don't typically believe that they're deserving of any love that's offered to them, which is why these same people push others away when they're offering any form of secure love or affection.
  
  for instance, if someone has been abvsed their entire life, they grow up believing that they deserve further abvse and neglect. if someone enters their life offering them emotional support and security, it will seem foreign to this person and they won't be able to trust their advances. a lot of people who are emotionally damaged distance themselves from healthy forms of relationships because they're so accustomed to being abvsed that they think that's all they deserve to know.

  those were the most painful spots for me personally - the ribs hurt more than the calf, i remember the pain was so bad that it felt like a white, searing pain. ?
  
  i might have to go through it all over again, though, because i want to get it retouched by a different artist and i'm scared af to go through with it.

  tattoo guns don't really look like needles unless you're watching the artist set up the gun itself, if that's any consolation for you, haha.
  
  however, it's a common fear and definitely not unheard of !! my best friend's husband is deathly afraid of needles, so he'll never get a tattoo.
  "
423532,"
   Any advice to someone who wants to get tattoos but afraid to?
  ","
  tbh i was really afraid of the pain at first as well because you're essentially going in blind without any idea of what the pain feels like, but it isn't really as bad as i expected it to be and it's more of an annoyance as opposed to actual pain.
  
  but i would definitely recommend getting your first tattoo in a spot that's the least painful !! you can look up various charts online of which parts of the body are the most and least painful.
  "
423533,"
   Your tattoos are beautiful where did you get them done and what does the rose tattoo say?

  thank you !! i got them done at a variety of shops over the years, but i recently found a local artist who's really good and i think i'll be sticking with her for a while. she's the one who did my avocado, linkin park logo, and coffee cup.
  
  the banner around my roses says ""amor vincit omnia"" which means ""love conquers all"" in latin.

   Any advice for your fellow writers?
  ","
  if there's one thing i've learned about writing throughout the years, then it's always to be critical of your own writing and don't allow your confidence to carry you away.
  
  it's ok to recognize that you're a good writer. however, there's always room for improvement. always. seek out constructive criticism to make your writing better and stay humble when it comes to your finished projects.
  
  in addition, don't allow other people's writing to make you feel unworthy or inadequate. everyone has a different style of writing, and just because you like one person's voice doesn't necessarily mean your voice is of lesser value.

   How do I confront someone about owing me money? I babysit and last night I worked but the parents had no cash and told me they'd get it to me today, but it's 9:19pm so that's obviously not happening. I'm annoyed, but also passive, and I don't really know how to politely say I need to get paid.
  ","
  babysitting is a job, and you need to be paid for your services - i would call the parents and gently remind them that they haven't paid you yet (they could have easily forgotten, which is still terrible, but very possible).
  
  you're entitled to that money because you earned it, so you don't have to be passive about this at all. you're not in the wrong here.

  yes, it does. when a parent terminates their rights as a parent, it also terminates the obligation of child support. if you want further information about this, speak to an attorney.

423545,"
   i guess you are kinda lucky (for this scenario) because you can choose to abort, whereas if a guy gets a girl accidentally pregnant she can disregard his wishes and have the child and ruin his life.

  this isn't a question and doesn't pertain to me. if a person wants nothing to do with their child, they can choose to sign away their rights.
  
  people's scenarios aren't to be compared to one another. i'm not lucky for having doubts about my own fertility, especially considering i'm in a long term relationship with a person with whom i'd want to have children later on down the road.
  "
423546,"
   you say you are not judgmental....but i bet when you see someone use the word ""retarded"" you immediately judge them to be a bad person.

  i just find it amusing how you're seemingly judging me for something you admit is a presumption about me as opposed to basing it on objective evidence.
  
  you can presume all you want about me because it doesn't affect my life at all. most opinions derived from assumptions are false anyway.

  constructive criticism is coming from a good place - the person giving it genuinely wants to help you succeed and they're willing to work with you to help you achieve that goal, which means pointing out things you could do better and helping you find the resources to do so.
  
  a personal attack comes from a bad place and that person wants you to feel bad about yourself. there's no opportunity for improvement and they just want you to fail.

   Arent you a little bit mad at chester bennington
  ","
  when i first heard of his passing, i was an entire mixture of emotions: anger, sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, etc etc.
  
  i felt angry because of the way he chose to die. i felt angry because all of the messages in his songs were about overcoming obstacles and becoming who you truly are and seeking out help and support if you needed it, and his death was contradictory to everything he's been telling his fans.
  
  i felt angry because i felt lost and helpless after his death - there was nothing i could do, and i was angry at myself because i feel like there was something i should have done, but as an insignificant fan, there was nothing i could do. i grew up feeling such an intimate connection to chester that i felt i knew him personally, even though i only met him once.
  
  but i was also filled with sorrow that washed away my anger. he was in pain, he's always been in pain, and he exhausted his resources for survival through to the very end. with his severity of mental illnesses, people say that it was a blessing that he lived for as long as he did. and as sad as i felt, i also felt blessed to have been able to share this lifetime with him because of the profound influence he had on my life without him even knowing it.

   thank you so much for answering! it's so nice to know that there Are people out there who experience such similar things. how does your boyfriend react to you when you get like that? i've been with my boyfriend for almost two years now, and quite frankly i think he's getting tired of it :/
  ","
  he usually calls me out on it and tells me that i'm over-reacting, which tbh is good for me because my strong emotions makes it hard for me to distinguish whether or not i'm ACTUALLY over-reacting. but we've been together for so long that he understands that my mood swings are against my control and that my reactions are a result of my trauma.
  
  which is really refreshing tbh because i know so many people whose significant others would get angry at them for their behavior, because they couldn't understand why they felt so strongly. i'm grateful that my boyfriend accepts me for who i am, even when my mental health makes me behave in erratic and irrational ways.
  "
423701,"
   as a fellow person who suffers from bpd, would you happen to have any tips for not taking everything so personally and not overreacting to such extremes? i have a tendency to be extremely sensitive towards comments (especially from my boyfriend) and ""jumping from a to z"" in the words of my therapist
  ","
  (cont) (part 2) and translating little things he says into ""he doesn't love me, i'm a terrible person, he deserves better and should find someone else, etc."" in my mind, which leads to either a breakdown or me ""shutting down"" and putting up a wall. i know he doesn't like when i do this, and neither do i, but i just can't seem to help it. obviously this stems from my deep rooted insecurities and self hatred, but i'd like to think there are ways for me to not overreact in such ways even if i don't love myself as of now without feeling like im faking it, so to speak.
  
  --
  
  tbh i know exactly how you feel because my BPD makes me do the same exact things; i have a tendency to over-react to minor incidents, i jump from A to Z in a moment's notice, i'm hypersensitive to people's statements (especially from my boyfriend or someone i care about), etc etc.
  
  i've been in therapy for about a year now, and so far none of what my therapist has tried to ""teach"" me has helped, because i'm still over-reacting to little things and jumping to conclusions super fast. i think it's just something you have to eventually condition yourself into thinking that's bad, you have to keep reminding yourself that not everything is in black or white terms (i know it's easier said than done), and people don't generally have ulterior motives in what they do and say.
  
  i feel you though, i really honestly do and i hope you learn over time how to get a better handle on your emotions. i'm right there with you.
