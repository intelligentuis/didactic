actually .","277501":"sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio .","277502":"i m doing well . i m currently having some wine and watching the jeffrey epstein documentary that s on netflix .","277503":"don t settle for anything less than what you deserve .","277504":"ah , thank you then .","277505":"i m not bothered by she her pronouns because i m femme presenting these days , even though my pronouns are they them .","277506":"thank you if you re referring to my profile picture , then it was drawn by shehitsback . her art is fantastic .","277507":"i literally just said i wasn t going to elaborate on it , lol .","277508":"i just like regular buttered popcorn .","277509":"at the time , yeah . it s based on this picture .","277510":"hello it s nearing the evening where i live pm , and i just finished eating dinner . i m thinking on popping on some netflix because i ve been wanting to watch that jeffrey epstein documentary .","277511":"i suggest you see a doctor if you re capable of doing so .","277512":"i would choose to become a vampire . i ve never really been all that interested in werewolves or the lore associated with them , and even in video games when given the option to be a vampire or werewolf such as in skyrim , i ve always chosen to be a vampire .","277513":"i would say it s an even split . i was broken up with once , i broke up with someone once , and my last breakup was pretty mutual even though i still love d him . this doesn t take into account the people who have broken my heart without us even dating , though , lol . i ve had infatuations with plenty of people who weren t interested in dating me , and i m sure it was also vice versa .","277514":"back in the day , married couples would stay together because there was such a stigma associated with divorce , and they would be unhappy in their relationship but continue to stay married because they didn t want to be viewed as a divorcee . these days , it s much more common to see married couples get divorced because there s so much less of a stigma , and people are standing up for themselves and their own worth in their marriage when they re being treated unfairly .","277515":"my own self motivation to succeed in the things i do , especially with respect to my job . also , iced coffee in the morning motivates me to get out of bed in the first place , lol .","277516":"it should be mandatory , and i m glad that businesses can refuse to serve customers if they walk in without wearing a mask . wearing a mask protects yourself and other people from spreading or contracting covid , and it s ridiculous how there are so many anti mask people wandering around . there are literally no downsides to wearing a mask for the minutes you re in the grocery store . surgeons and other health professionals wear surgical masks all day long . people need to listen to health workers instead of reading a stupid post on the internet validating their wrong opinions .","277517":"thanks , it s a drawing by shehitsback .","277518":"i never lived in any of the five boroughs , so i wouldn t have that type of accent .","277519":"a cup of iced coffee and nicotine .","277520":"what also concerns me is that these same people want to act like a therapist or something , even though their input to my problems when i have posted them here has never been therapeutic , lmaoo .","277521":"i haven t done much today at all . i had breakfast , had a phone appointment with my psychiatrist , and then the counseling center called me and told me they have a therapist for me and we can start our sessions next week , which is good . i watched a few youtube videos on assassin s creed valhalla , and then i took a long nap . haha .","277522":"this is so stupid , lmao .","277523":"assassin s creed valhalla looks intense . so excited . https www . youtube . com watch ? v tzved","277524":"i just stated it a fear of abandonment .","277525":"you evidently have never been to therapy before

paperwork , and my first appointment with her is next monday . i m excited but also nervous . i m going to have a lot to unload on her , lmaoo .","277529":"uneventful so far . the only things i ve done are order breakfast and do my telephone appointment with my psychiatrist .","277530":"lol , yes . i m not going to elaborate on it , though .","277531":"no , i haven t seen friends other than my two roommates since july th . prior to that , i don t even remember when i last saw a friend .","277532":"idk , most of the daring things i ve done or have done with other people were actually really reckless and dangerous , lol . it felt thrilling in the moment , like i was truly alive and nothing could hurt me .","277533":"i ordered breakfast through grubhub this morning , and in the instructions , it says to leave the food on the stoop and then text me . instead , this delivery driver f cking pounds on the front door , even though we have a doorbell . like . . . what . it scared the crap out of me .","277534":"i have absolutely no clue about any of that , so i can t comment . i wouldn t want to comment on it even if i knew what you were talking about , because sending people s names around and asking for opinions on their opinions is silly and childish anyway .","277535":"some drama is entertaining , yes . sometimes i find myself scrolling through the comments of people s posts on facebook if they re arguing , lmaoo .","277536":"i m both , haha . i m very impulsive and spontaneous , and i don t generally make plans ahead of time . at the same time , i m also organized particularly in my work space . i m also cleaning often because i like the house looking spacious and organized .","277537":"white pizza with spinach and ricotta . if i m not in the mood for that , then i usually order caprese pizza fresh mozzarella , tomatoes , basil , and balsamic glaze .","277538":"i m not a fan of sweets , but oatmeal cookies are delicious .","277539":"i have two roommates . it would be weird to pick a favorite , because they re people . . . not objects . they re both good people .","277540":"the emotional neglect i experienced in childhood contributed to my intense fear of abandonment as an adult .","277541":"the weeknd , even though i only know a few songs of his .","277542":"i mean , sure ? if you re interested in reading , then it s beneficial mentally to read various books because not only does it increase your vocabulary and creativity , but it s also a valuable way of spending spare time .","277543":"alcohol , nicotine , listening to music , and reading .","277544":"happy sunday i just had a telephone appointment with my psychiatrist , and in light of my increased stress and anxiety , she upped the dosage of my xanax and strongly urged me to seek out therapy . so . . . that s how my day is going .","277545":"it s currently degrees fahrenheit where i live .","277546":"yeah , but not by a police officer . . . lmao .","277547":"dunkin large iced coffee with skim milk , vanilla swirl , and a shot of espresso . starbucks venti cold brew with sugar free vanilla syrup and soy milk . bagel store deli large iced coffee with vanilla creamer .","277548":"stable mental health .","277549":"new zealand , iceland , italy , spain , russia , and greece .","277550":"i ve been reading a book about ab sive toxic parents , and it just resonates with me a lot and has been making me emotional .","277551":"that sounds very tranquil , haha . i wish i could do that where i live .","277552":"i once saw the constellations when i took a vacation to upstate new york a few years ago , it was life changing and absolutely marvelous .","277553":"unfortunately , it s nearly impossible to see the stars where i live because of light pollution , lol .","277554":"cease and desist . it basically means that it s a legal action taken against someone who s doing illegal activity and threatening to sue them if they don t stop . since linkin park issued it , twitter deleted the tweet that trump posted showcasing the video with their music .","277555":"my roommate made spaghetti and meatballs two weeks ago for dinner , lol . it s always been a favorite dish of mine , especially with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top .","277556":"considering i was emotionally physically ab sed for plus years and i still feel the effects of their ab se in my adult life , yeah . i m on page and i ve cried already . it s difficult acknowledging things , but in light of what s been going on with my parents lately , i felt like i needed to finally read this book .","277557":"i m starting to read this book , and i m only on page of the introduction i m already tearing up , lmao fuck .","277558":"it does , lol .","277559":"i think it would deteriorate , because the majority of my social interaction is done online .","277560":"i prefer the former .","277561":"no , they re not targeted to aid in sleep or anything . i have valerian root in case i do need help with sleeping , but i only take that when i feel as if i can t sleep .","277562":"this defines more than half of my friendships , unfortunately . i feel as if i m always the one reaching out to see how a friend is doing or to hang out . i ve never brought it up in conversation before because i don t really want to give off the impression that i m clingy or anything , and i also don t want to lose them as a friend .","277563":"thankfully , i don t have problems with sleeping . the worst that has ever happened is waking up throughout the night every few hours , but that only happens on the rare occasion .","277564":"i use profanity a lot , but other than that , i m not a vulgar person .","277565":"usually , yes both in a platonic and romantic fashion . i try to express my love and gratitude on a regular basis .","277566":"it doesn t sway me either way , tbh . i don t have a desire to see one , but i m not against it either .","277567":"i ve never really listened to it before , and i ve never been to an opera before . so i honestly don t know .","277568":"yeah , i would get plastic surgery in a heartbeat , lol . i would have a neck lift surgery to make my jawline more prominent .","277569":"yes , saturdays and sundays are my days off from work .","277570":"i don t think there is ? trump has done this multiple times in the past regarding using artists songs , and then the artist being like , hey , don t use my song because i don t support you . i m not entirely sure how it works . chester can t , but the rest of linkin park can . mike shinoda in particular , i m sure he s going to speak up on it eventually .","277571":"i m literally in shock over trump s new campaign video , he just posted it on twitter hours ago . . . it uses in the end by linkin park , covered by a few other artists . linkin park , and particularly chester , would have never authorized the use of their song for trump . the cover artists also did not authorize the use of their cover for trump . and this couldn t have come at a worse possible time merely two days before the anniversary of chester s passing . seriously . this has made me so livid . smh .","277572":"not generally , no . if it s something petty and not harmful , then it can be fun to watch . but if someone s personal situation is serious or dire and they re the subject of drama in light of it , then i think that s really immature .","277573":"definitely not . covid is real , it has k lled hundreds of thousands of people , and more have been infected who haven t d ed . i know dozens of people who have been infected with it and recovered , and i also know of people who have passed away from it .","277574":"maybe ? lmaoo . i ve never exactly analyzed my ankles before in that respect .","277575":"i agree . also , looking at a screen for too long hurts my eyes , so i can t envision myself sitting down with a tablet and reading a book electronically for hours at a time .","277576":"it was completely empty probably should have mentioned that first . my guess is that they bought a new bag while on the cruise and left the old one behind .","277577":"yeah , i just kept it . it s not as if they were going to give it back to whoever owned it last , if they could even track down who that person was , especially with respect to covid this was back in february .","277578":"i prefer paper books . i ve never read an electronic book before , and the idea has never appealed to me .","277579":"i found it under the bed when i went on the cruise , lol . the people who previously had the room before us must have forgotten it . it s actually a really small , convenient over the shoulder bag that fits my stuff perfectly .","277580":"i ve never bought a designer bag before , lol . the bag i currently use was actually free lmao .","277581":"it would be nice to travel , but i don t have that sort of money right now .","277582":"that s why i said i was healthy for the most part , lol . obviously not all the time .","277583":"if it s their choice , then no . however , the expectation that a man should work and a woman should stay home is archaic .","277584":"probably the black cherry body spray i used earlier this morning prior to leaving the house .","277585":"i honestly can t remember , tbh . it was probably when i had my last car accident years ago and filed a report with the officer .","277586":"i believe it s fair to divide responsibilities up between partners . you both share that home therefore , you re both responsible for it . the idea that a man should work and a woman should stay home and take care of everything in the household is an archaic model .","277587":"if a partner doesn t have a job and stays home all the time assuming no children are involved , then i believe that they should take care of some of the chores . however , a partnership includes mutual responsibility , so it shouldn t fall all on that partner .","277588":"having a job is no excuse for not doing essential chores around the house , lol . me and both of my roommates work full time , and we still find time to do things around the house that need to be done .","277589":"a child ren growing up with two unhappy , angry parents is going to be worse off than a child ren growing up with a happy single parent . the happiness of the parents is recognized by the child , and if a child is raised in an abrasive or volatile environment , then that s going to negatively affect them . in most cases , divorce can be for the better in the long run .","277590":"i eat healthy food , lol . i have fruits and vegetables often instead of things like potato chips , i don t snack at night or eat candy , i very rarely have ice cream it s been a few months , actually , and i don t drink soda , among other things .","277591":"i m most definitely not a health freak , haha . i m healthy for the most part , but i m not one of those health smoothie , yoga practicing , drinking a gallon of water per day , type of person . i enjoy treating myself to cheeseburgers and tacos occasionally , i drink alcohol , and i have iced coffee every morning . lmaoo .","277592":"i don t really think i understand the situation fully . . . are you saying that your boyfriend and you broke up for weeks , and during that week period , you slept with someone else and was contacting your ex , prior to getting back together with your boyfriend ? if he s asking for details and you re not comfortable sharing them , then i would simply tell him that . there may be a time and place where you are comfortable sharing those details , but try to emphasize that the past is in the past , and your previous relation with whoever the other guy was doesn t matter anymore . especially considering it was many years ago .","277593":"i m assuming she follows people who also speak her native language , so her questions can go out to both english speaking people and people who speak in that language as

out , etc etc .","277595":"i enjoy your questions . however , you should do whatever makes you feel comfortable and what you enjoy .","277596":"nope , lmaoo . just like i didn t actually laugh when i typed lmaoo . some things do make me chuckle , but for me it s just a way to break up the sentence so i don t sound serious of the time .","277597":"i m currently listening to a halo music compilation

through a difficult moment in your life .","277599":"no , i never said that . if i did , then i likely meant it in a way in which i was attracted to him on first glance . i didn t actually fall in love with him until months after we started to actually date .","277600":"ah , that s a difficult situation especially since you ve already talked to him so often about this already . my go to answer is always open communication , but considering you ve already been doing that , i m not sure what else to suggest . i m lucky in that both of my roommates clean up after themselves , so i never have to pick up after them . but i can definitely understand your frustration because that would get on my nerves too . perhaps approach the topic differently ? instead of saying , for example , hey , you need to clean up after yourself go for an approach where you tell him that cleanliness is a value you appreciate , and you feel much more comfortable in your place when things are in their rightful place , and he would likely be more comfortable too . i m just throwing things out there . . . idk . i would most definitely be angry in your situation too .","277601":"no , love at first sight does not exist . what a person feels when they see someone is lust at best , their own interpretation of what love may be with them , not how it actually is . it s an illusion and a fantasy .","277602":"i

or a setting on the buzzer .","277604":"your main question was a ridiculous question that i had no interest in answering , lmaoo . in addition , your follow up statements were equally as ridiculous

.","277605":"there s a bigger heroin problem on long island than crack , tbh . i m not sure about the city or upstate new york , though . perhaps when you were in elementary school , they reinforced the idea of no silly questions , but definitely not in high school and for sure not in college , rofl .","277606":"lol . it isn t a serious question , it s a silly scenario and not a question i m interested in answering . it s trolling at best .","277607":"lol . you ve never asked me this question before . this is something i would normally delete because it s trollish and ridiculous

so tired of the color after it s safe to go to salons again and my friend is comfortable doing hair , i m going to color it dark brown and red like a balayage .","277613":"yes , i m left handed

we re throwing parties with multiple people or something . it s gotten to the point where it s fine to see one person , or even two , as long as you re not congregating in large groups . the people who are throwing parties and showing up in large groups and pretending that things are normal , i . e . the people going to the beach , are the ones who are making the cases skyrocket again

haha . i mean , i m a fairly impulsive person to begin with so it isn t really out of character for me . i was sitting in the salon chair for a regular cut and color , and i told my stylist , hey . . . shave half of my head . i already had an undercut on the right side to begin with , but i really wanted half of my head shaved right up to my natural part .","277620":"not as much as i wanted , lol . i ended up taking the recycle out , putting some cardboard boxes in the garage , wiped down the bathroom , uploading the dishwasher , and changing the garbage bags .","277621":"we all do our own separate laundry , lol .","277622":"it was an impulsive decision that i made last minute when i was already at the salon .","277623":"no , we all have different tasks around the house . i normally clean the dishes and mop the floors , my one roommate vacuums and cleans the living room , and my second roommate does all of the cat litter and cat maintenance lol . i feed the cats sometimes when no one else is home , but that s all .","277624":"haha , thank you .","277625":"this is a pretty accurate representation at the moment . my roots are horrible .","277626":"lol , i absolutely hate clutter so i try to have things as organized as possible . even when there are a few dishes in the sink , i try to clean them immediately because it just bothers me so much .","277627":"thank you ! ! it s an hp . my previous laptop was also an hp , and it has never given me any issues besides slowing down after using it for several years , so i wanted to stick with the same brand . it s a very reliable brand .","277628":"it s just an iced coffee in a thermos , lol .","277629":"no , i don t work on saturdays .","277630":"your feelings are completely valid and justified , i believe i would feel hurt

always that whole seven degrees of separation thing going on , and you know a lot more people than you actually think .","277635":"no , i don t generally hate anyone . hate is a very strong word and

scrambled eggs and bacon with toast , or just scrambled eggs by themselves depending on how hungry i am . this morning , i had to drop my roommate off at his girlfriend s house , so he picked us up some mcdonald s breakfast sandwiches before we left the house .","277637":"most of the time , i brush my teeth twice per day . sometimes i forget and only brush them once , though . lol .","277638":"i

.","277644":"no , i just proofread my answers thoroughly before posting . lmao .","277645":"because i like the feeling of being tipsy and numb from pain and worry .","277646":"you guys tell me , i ve been drunk for the last hours . lmao .","277647":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","277648":"i ve been feeling pretty fine . then again , i m drunk rn so i have no recollection of how i

ve met her on multiple occasions .","277656":"probably not , but i ve never looked into it very much . i can assume it s based primarily on your relationship to that person , whether it s a personal relationship or a professional relationship .","277657":"you only stated the first part of that sentence . regardless , it s just a sentence it isn t a question , so i deleted it .","277658":"he already has a girlfriend , lol . it doesn t bother me all that matters to me is that he s happy .","277659":"i would assume it s a combination of being inherently good at seeing things from an artistic angle and then also practicing a lot .","277660":"i enjoy painting , but i wouldn t really say that i m good at it , lol .","277661":"i did when i was a child , up until my parents entered my room and read my entire journal front to back . after that , i didn t keep a journal anymore .","277662":"i don t live with my parents .","277663":"on plenty of occasions , yes .","277664":"surprisingly , no . i drank a decent amount of coffee this morning , and i worked all day until pm , at least . it s currently pm and i have no plans of going to bed anytime soon .","277665":"that happened to me this morning actually , lol . i woke up around am and couldn t fall back asleep , so i stayed awake .","277666":"they likely weren t questions , or they were ridiculous questions that i felt didn t warrant an answer . if you were to repeat the questions , i would tell you why i didn t answer them .","277667":"fear me , i am the epitome of satan

still commuting to the office , and people called in all the time .","277671":"no , i m more numb than anything else .","277672":"no , i ve always been too afraid to call into a radio station . lmaoo .","277673":"not really , no . as long as there s open communication regardless of who is the one contacting first , then it shouldn t matter . i m also coming from the age where when i was first dating my ex , we did phone calls instead of text messages . . . so , yeah .","277674":"i ve always considered myself quite timid .","277675":"probably ? i wouldn t know , i don t believe i have a strong personality , lol .","277676":"no , he wouldn t be okay with it unless i was okay with it . and because i expressed my hesitation with it , he wasn t interested in doing it anymore .","277677":"probably my own insecurities about my partner leaving me for the other person , lol . i ve never been able to envision myself in a poly relationship , i think i would overthink the situation too much .","277678":"i get some decent anons questions , and most of my questions come from anons , so i see no reason to turn it off .","277679":"i m indifferent to anons . i m only interested in actual questions .","277680":"i m actually pretty cold rn , lmaoo .","277681":"stereotypes are fine to acknowledge , but it s also important to acknowledge when where stereotypes are wrong and why they re stereotypes to begin with .","277682":"probably ? i don t remember much of when i was a child .","277683":"yes , i vote in every presidential election .","277684":"no . people should only be taxed based on the tax bracket they re in in terms of their financial status .","277685":"no , i wouldn t be able to do polyamorous relationships , lol . my ex and i talked about it for a while when my sexual libido was nonexistent , but it wasn t something either of us were interested in doing .","277686":"i believe everyone has the right to maintain any sort of relationship s they want to maintain , as long as everything is consensual .","277687":"yes , there are a plethora of health issues that run in my family , including heart disease , diabetes , cancer , alcoholism , etc etc .","277688":"followers don t mean anything , lol . if you place that much emphasis and importance on how many followers you have , then you have some deep seated issues that you need to work on .","277689":"not as expensive as most people like to believe . it s easier to buy food from the grocery store than to buy fast food all the time it lasts longer , and most healthy food products like fruits and vegetables are pretty cheap on their own .","277690":"yeah , it s a decent song .","277691":"as my bio indicates , i live in new york .","277692":"i literally just answered this , lol . however , i m doing well . i m currently vibing and listening to music .","277693":"i m doing well ! ! i m currently very tipsy , and i m listening to music , answering questions on askfm , and browsing the internet .","277694":". . . are you asking to see my cv resume ? lmaoo .","277695":"i like it ! ! especially the guitar in the background . this doesn t sound like a song from the s , funnily enough . it sounds more like a late s s song .","277696":"send me the name of the song and the artist , i ll look it up .","277697":"not from anons , no . if you ask me to search for something , then i ll search for it though .","277698":"if i know them already , then yeah . i don t add random people , though .","277699":"lol . i mean . . . to each their own . everyone has bodily autonomy , which means they can do what they like to their own bodies . i have no say in the matter .","277700":"oh , please . if you re looking for answers to fetish questions , then seek it out somewhere else .","277701":"no ? that would be adrenaline , not alcohol .","277702":"i don t wear anything on my wrists .","277703":"no problem that s what i m here for . i always try to provide an open platform for others to discuss things i ve personally experienced , so i ve always been open about the things i ve gone through currently going through . insight into my behavior is good , but it s also something i hide from people like my doctors . which may be an indication of a problem .","277704":"lol , that s totally true ! ! i honestly don t even know if i want children in the future , it s something i always wonder about . my roommate i were talking about it a few days ago , actually . he s naturally a fatherly person so he wants children , so i was explaining to him how pregnancy freaks me out and i would adopt if anything else .","277705":"black leggings and a gray tank top that has a purple rainbow on it that says good vibes .","277706":"i m concerned to a certain extent , because i know drinking every day is bad . . . but it doesn t deter me from drinking . it s my way to relax at the end of the day . honestly , i ve always wondered if i was in denial about potential alcoholism . there are some nights i do drink to get drunk , but it s maybe once per week if anything . otherwise , it calms me down and puts me in a relaxed state of mind and body . my father was is an alcoholic , so my family has always been concerned about my drinking habits . they obviously don t know that i drink every night , otherwise they d freak out . my mother also always gave me a hard time about going out and drinking with my friends on friday or saturday nights , so there s a certain stigma associated with it in my family .","277707":"lol . i honestly didn t even pick up on the typo , lmaoo . i m also a bit tipsy now , so yeah .","277708":"i ve tried that , and they ve always looked at me weird , lol . like . . . when my ex s goddaughters and godsons were young , like years old , i tried talking to them but i felt so weird about it . i ve never grown up around children and i never babysat anyone before , so i think that s where it stems from .","277709":"no , i don t talk to strangers on instagram .","277710":"lol , thank you ! ! some people say i have a definitely new york long island accent , but i suppose it depends on the person .","277711":"honestly . . . i don t know . i drink every night , but at the same time , i don t get drunk every night , and it doesn t deter me from completing my daily tasks and responsibilities . i ve heard that is the definition of a functioning alcoholic , but i don t feel as if i m dependent on it either . it s a really gray area that i m treading rn .","277712":"no , i haven t looked into it .","277713":"i haven t really remained up to date with a lot of things , so it doesn t surprise me that i haven t heard about it . i ve been focusing my attention on my work and creative writing these days .","277714":"i don t remember very much , but i have nostalgic feelings about dragonball z and thundercats .","277715":"i wasn t even aware of this , lmaoo . i m not worried my twitter is private , and i don t really post there very often anyway . i mostly retweet stuff and post photos .","277716":"i believe i became interested in politics when i was in my early s , somewhere around college during the middle of obama s presidency . i had previous knowledge of government and some politics during high school , but i didn t really start paying much attention until i was introduced to feminism .","277717":"tbh , i don t remember anything about the bush administration . i was only years old when obama took office , and for the first few years of his tenure , i paid zero attention to politics .","277718":"ask me questions , friends i m drinking , it s friday night , and i m home alone .","277719":"yeah , sometimes i get too much sleep . most nights , i try to get at least hours of sleep .","277720":"you re asking the totally wrong person , lol . i ve never been in a sorority before , and i have no idea how they work .","277721":"i have no idea how to talk to children or what they can cannot comprehend at whatever age , so i honestly have no clue .","277722":"here , i saw this and it reminded me of you . you told me you were having a bad day , so i did this for you . want to go grab a drink and watch some live music ? let s spend the night in and watch stupid movies and listen to music by the fire .","277723":"if that was the case , i could probably cure cancer for the entire world . lmaoo .","277724":"the general misconception about people having piercings and tattoos is that they re unprofessional , which cannot be further from the truth . your taste in body modifications does not determine your work ethic or ability to be a good employee manager etc etc . , and people should not be judged on the piercings or tattoos that they have .","277725":"i don t believe i would be able to make a determination like that , considering i ve only left the united states once and that was to go to the bahamas . i have a lot of traveling to do , and i don t want to say that i want to live somewhere without at least visiting it first .","277726":"england , new zealand , and italy .","277727":"i don t believe so ? my hair has been consistently colored since the age of , haha . my roots

! i just finished up work , and then i took a quick run and also to get some gas for my car . ask me questions , friends","277730":"well , isn t over yet so that isn t a determination i can make .","277731":"when you ve completed your responsibilities for the day .","277732":"both years have had their ups and downs , so it s difficult to compare them .","277733":"i ve never stated that i had an eating disorder .","277734":"i don t really like cooking because i m not very good at it , besides breakfast foods . as for eating , i m a bit indifferent to it unless i have a craving for

much credit as i deserve at times , and i m often incredibly hard on myself even though i m not as hard on my friends for the same reasons . i made a splendid breakfast for myself this morning , for example , and i didn t believe i could do that because it was something i never tried before .","277739":"no , i most definitely would not go on a blind date . i haven t even shown an interest in dating while knowing who someone is , at any rate .","277740":"toxic masculinity does exist , and it s exhibited in the mental health stigma men face on a regular basis . men with mental health issues aren t taken as seriously as women s mental health issues because men have been conditioned to suppress their emotions , being told that having emotions is weak and not manly . more men attempt s icide than women , from my understanding , in light of this .","277741":"a better house to rent or an apartment , lmao . i enjoy the house we live in now , but there are some issues with the house

breaker . additionally , there s really little insulation throughout the house , and the toilet isn t big enough .","277742":"i m honestly not looking forward to anything , lol . there are no upcoming events that are happening thanks to covid , and it s not as if i can make restaurant or bar dates with friends to look forward to .","277743":"my life was much different one year ago than it is today . i was still living with my parents back then , and i was on the verge of my ex and i breaking up , so i was very uncertain in our relationship . i wasn t happy at all with my living circumstances , and my depression was high at that point in time . i was also experiencing panic attacks still because it was before i was prescribed xanax for my panic attacks and generalized anxiety . now , i m living on my own with two roommates away from my parents , and although i m single now , i m still close friends with my ex and our friendship is pretty strong , stronger than it was during the last few months of us dating . i have my anxiety managed for the most part , and i haven t had a panic attack in months .","277744":"there are tons of abandoned buildings on long island , such as pilgrim

that s more anime than anything else . favorite cartoon show bob s burgers .","277770":"i didn t watch the interview , and the only thing i know about it is that she cheated on him with someone else , lol . i really have no idea about the entire ordeal .","277771":"i think that s a bit rude unfair , tbh . being stuck up is not a good quality to have regardless of the reason .","277772":"volatile , ab sive , dysfunctional , and suppressive .","277773":"i get a plethora of stupid questions on an average basis , so i wouldn t be able to narrow it down to just one .","277774":"yeah , it s been said

.","277776":"hello , new work station . ?","277777":"i was a legal writer for a law firm .","277778":"it s pretty difficult and complex , actually . there are a lot of components to it that some people can t grasp . especially if they re not a native english speaker .","277779":"i d still love to receive your questions ! ! as a filler i m currently transferring files from my old laptop onto a flash drive . . . i didn t realize how many files i had , lol . i m up to nearly files and it s not even done yet .","277780":"it all depends on which company you end up working for , your experience , where you live cost of living and wages differ depending on where you are , etc etc . this wasn t an entry level job for me i had years past professional experience in writing prior to getting this job . it pays me well enough for me to sustain myself right now , but i obviously do want more money .","277781":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","277782":"my day has been fine thus far it s been a productive day at work , and i m clocking out for the day in about minutes . afterwards , i m going to set up my new laptop ! ! i m super excited .","277783":"sometimes , lol . i absolutely hate jump scares because they make my anxiety go wild , and i have a tendency to become very paranoid after watching a horror movie .","277784":"no , that would be pretty classist to do so . not everyone has had the privilege of obtaining an education that allows for advanced study of grammar , and also some people simply cannot grasp it as firmly as others .","277785":"american .","277786":"i ve never written a comic before , so i don t have much advice in that respect . most of what i write are short essays and poetry that focus on a few themes , but not too many . i would say to do things in steps and try to compartmentalize each part of the process so it doesn t feel like you have this large project ahead of you . take things step by step , and space it out over the course of a few days or weeks instead of expecting yourself to do everything in one shot .","277787":"i overthink in my daily life , but not really while i m writing , lol .","277788":"write consistently , every day if you re able to do so . the writing doesn t have to be good or perfect , but the only way to get better at your craft is to practice on a routine basis .","277789":"not that i m aware of , no . writing is a release for me a release of my emotions , of the things that are troubling me . it comes out of me naturally , so there s really little thinking involved unless i m trying to remember a specific word i want to use .","277790":"i don t chat on askfm , i m here to answer questions .","277791":"hello do you have a question ?","277792":"i ve been listening to halo

impulsive , haha . i ve been known to spend money on random items without a second thought at times , i make drastic changes to my hair in that same moment , and i binge drink . last night was sorta

.","277809":"that s all well and good , but you don t really have a say in the matter .","277810":"honestly , i don t really think you should be thinking that far ahead . dating someone is different from moving in with someone , and you ll probably date quite a few people before you make the decision to move in with someone . at that point , the feelings you have for that person and your compatibility will trump everything else .","277811":"no , i definitely do not have the stamina for that . lol .","277812":"lol , yes . every single time . i know most of the words to the songs in les

.","277828":". . . so ask it .","277829":"a few of my friends are exceptionally kind , but they re not the sort of kind to where they d allow people to walk all over them . they re considerate and caring , but they also set boundaries and know when to put their foot down .","277830":"you cannot ultimately trust someone besides yourself . you never know when there will be a falling out with someone to whom you ve entrusted your secrets , and there s always the risk of someone talking about you or betraying you behind your back .","277831":"hello do you have a question ?","277832":"myself , lately . i ve been striving to make a better life for myself because i know that i deserve to be happy , and that requires me working on bettering myself and doing things that bring me enjoyment .","277833":"i used to have really bizarre re occurring nightmares when i was a teenager . they would happen almost every night , or at least nights when i was under great stress . i don t want to get into what they were about because they re incredibly gruesome .","277834":"sunsets and sunrises on the beach , meteor showers , and live music performances .","277835":"i worked in retail at a drug store for years . it was terrible , lol . i was berated and yelled at by customers every day for things out of my control , the expectations from upper management were ridiculous , and every day was stressful . but , i didn t have any prior experience and i was good at what i was doing . i kept getting promoted , and eventually i did enjoy running the photo lab . i needed the cash to get myself through college , and i was relieved when i got my degree so i didn t have to work in retail anymore .","277836":"depends on how i feel around them . i m generally an open book to begin with but there are a lot of things that i also keep to myself .","277837":"slenderman ! ! that was always really interesting to me , especially when the marble hornets videos came out .","277838":"i believe that there is extraterrestrial life , and the government whether it s in the us or elsewhere knows about it and is keeping it hidden from public knowledge .","277839":"i ve always been intrigued by the backstory behind the joker . i m not sure how it s written in the comics , but movies like the dark knight and joker really made me intrigued by his character .","277840":"not really , no . i don t like clutter so i try to keep my personal belongings to a minimum .","277841":"i went to disneyland once when i was a toddler .","277842":"yeah , i hated working in retail i worked at a drug store for years . my job prior to this current job wasn t terrible , but the work became too overwhelming with really short deadlines . i didn t hate it exactly , but i was stressed to the point of tears very often .","277843":"it was a relationship , lol . i had my following relationship two years later and the feelings were the same . you can t exactly pass sound judgment on a relationship that you don t know of . my first ex and i dated for several months , and our friendship is much different than how our former relationship was . we didn t talk for over a year because of how heartbroken i was .","277844":"yeah , because making out and having shared romantic feelings for someone obviously means it was just a friendship . lmaoo .","277845":"i d honestly do what i m doing now ! ! i enjoy my job a lot .","277846":"i ve never ordered food on an airplane before , but there was a tgi fridays at the airport and my ex and i ate there between flights . it wasn t terrible standard chain

night .","277848":"when i was a toddler in kindergarten , my fingers got smashed inside of the bathroom door on the side with the hinges . doctors had to sew the tip of my ring finger back on because

the guacamole i had in the fridge , lmaoo .","277857":"november .","277858":"pros lots of diversity in the environment i . e . you can go upstate to see mountains , there are lots of parks , and you can go to long island for the beaches . pretty much everything is close by , or within minutes of one another . there are some towns where you can walk to get your groceries . cons expensive as hell . the cost of living is too high for most people , and no one makes a liveable wage at minimum wage . very congested and crowded . traffic is horrible . i ve enjoyed my friends and i currently like the town i live in , but i do eventually want to move out of state .","277859":"i ve watched the entire game of thrones series , and i ve always loved the show . house stark is my favorite .","277860":"my

a soul , but i don t think there s a specific location in the body for it . i think it s just the entirety of our being or existence it s who we are on an innate level , sorta like an aura .","277862":"doesn t matter much to me . i m not looking to date someone at the moment .","277863":"yeah , i was years old .","277864":"yeah , my first relationship was with a girl .","277865":"i m

doing fine . i just went on my lunch break from work , so i m going to lay down for a bit and see if i can t get rid of the headache .","277868":"yeah , my second ex was a toxic person and it was a toxic relationship . we didn t date for very long , for which i m thankful , but he was a groomer and i m happy that i got out of that relationship as early as i did .","277869":"idk much about either , but i like ariana grande s music .","277870":"i was bullied for my appearance .","277871":"strawberries , raspberries , and blueberries .","277872":"i usually lay down and scroll through social media while listening to music , and then i ll have a drink and watch television for the night .","277873":"i ve never heard of the second one before , haha . i don t drink soda really , i prefer coffee and iced tea .","277874":"light beers ipas , margaritas , and pinot grigio wine .","277875":"this was me last night , i couldn t sleep and kept waking up every few hours . i don t really do anything special except check social media and then lay back down and try to go back to sleep .","277876":"it s one of askfm s moods you can add to your profile . it s under settings .","277877":"well the cigarettes totally will , lmaoo . but i understand my breakfast used to consist of just coffee or energy drinks and cigarettes back in the day too .","277878":"that doesn t surprise me at all .","277879":"no , conflict makes me extremely anxious and nervous .","277880":"absolutely not . it s putting children , teachers , administration , and pretty much anyone else who works in the school at risk . cases are rising in several states in the us , and it makes no sense to send students back to school right now . many parents i know are electing to homeschool their kids .","277881":"depends on the day . i usually eat three meals per day , but sometimes i skip lunch if i m not hungry .","277882":"i don t read magazines .","277883":"yes , i do . i m fairly open about my experiences with mental illness .","277884":"good morning ! ! hope everyone has had a fantastic day . ?","277885":"shehitsback drew me .","277886":"having sex is the most common way of people getting pregnant , so it s easy and common to assume that . there s also the option of ivf , surrogacy , and adoption . i don t believe those are as common as people becoming pregnant , though .","277887":"that makes sense , tbh .","277888":"i wrote nearly words in the past hour , someone be proud of me .","277889":"i guess people aren t allowed to have a favorite animal anymore , lmaoo .","277890":"i think it s such a tragic incident , and this week has been heartbreaking with respect for celebrity deaths .","277891":"anyone have those frustrating moments where they want to write something creatively , but they can t figure out what they want to write about ? i looked up writing prompts online , and they all seem so silly to me . the most daunting part of writing is looking at the blank screen and cursor just blinking at you .","277892":"lol , this is a valid point .","277893":"yeah , it isn t really a big deal to me .","277894":"i wasn t feeling well this morning , i was having digestive problems that was distracting me from my work . since then , i ve slowly been feeling better .","277895":"go to the bay , order a drink , and lay out in the sand while soaking up the sunshine .","277896":"hello i m feeling a bit better now . i just ordered a new laptop , which will be delivered on thursday . i just spent the past hours transferring files into a new folder so i can easily put them on a flash drive and place them in my new laptop .","277897":"me , lol .","277898":"duel wielding war axes .","277899":"my new laptop is being delivered on thursday .","277900":"lately i ve been eating pasta again . i had penne ala vodka the other night , which was delicious .","277901":"i m not sure if i can think of one , haha . i don t know very much about whatever is trending , it isn t something i necessarily pay much attention to .","277902":"i understand both sides of the issue . on the one hand , giving children smartphones may be detrimental to their development and make them almost too reliable on technology . however , when it comes to children going out with friends , it s good to have a cell phone in case they get into trouble . i think the best compromise would be , like . . . a phone that can only make and receive calls and texts , instead of having internet and an abundance of social media . however , i also recognize that s unrealistic too .","277903":"neither . i have no interest in being involved with law enforcement .","277904":"of course . i ve disliked a few of my coworkers over the years , but it s important to remain on good terms with them for the sake of not getting into unnecessary confrontations . it isn t professional .","277905":"i m the wrong person to ask this question because i m in a constant state of nervousness anxiety . lmaoo . if i m having a confrontation with someone , then my thoughts are normally racing and my heart is beating out of my chest .","277906":"i don t think you re required to post a return address . however , i ve never done this before so i honestly don t know .","277907":"i don t necessarily believe so , no . it could simply mean that they re not close to you . i m not close to most of my coworkers , so it wouldn t offend me if they didn t invite me somewhere .","277908":"i don t believe it s fake , no . at the same time , however , when you work in retail you re supposed to greet the customers in such a manner . it s also a good set up for also asking them did you find everything you needed today ? etc etc .","277909":"i agree with you , anthropology is an interest of mine and i find it fascinating as well . i would also study criminology , sociology , and psychology .","277910":"teleportation , so i wouldn t have to worry about driving anywhere . i have really bad driving anxiety , especially to places i ve never been to before , so it would be a relief to be able to teleport somewhere .","277911":"answering questions on askfm , listening to music , and looking into different laptops since i want to purchase a new laptop soon .","277912":"having the ability to do what i need want to do without any restrictions , mostly in a personal sense . i didn t have a sense of freedom when i lived with my parents , so now i enjoy the freedom and independence of being able to do what i want on my own schedule .","277913":"i d rather cook for myself than spend money on food at a fast food restaurant , lol . sometimes i ll get dunkin on doordash , but it s only maybe once every weeks when i don t feel like cooking or making my own coffee .","277914":"i work from home and i work hours per week monday through friday , so it was bound to happen eventually .","277915":"no , i m content with the fairness and rationality of being a human .","277916":"eh , they ve been frequenting my page for a few weeks now so it doesn t bother me anymore . i reckon they re just from another country and english is their second language .","277917":"no , i clocked out of work early almost an hour ago .","277918":"like i said , i m not answering questions on my phone at the moment . i don t have selfies on my laptop .","277919":"i haven t gotten my hair done since last november , so right now my hair is a very long mess .","277920":"? ? ? the reason why i don t drive my car is because i ve been working from home , lol . when i worked in the office , i drove at least miles per day .","277921":"i m pretty sure i ve done this before . either way , i m not answering questions from my phone rn so i can t take a video .","277922":"my room is a mess rn and my bed isn t made , so no . lol .","277923":"i get oil changes every six months and my inspection done every year . i haven t driven the car except to local places once per week or so , so i haven t needed to gas up my car in like a month , lmaoo .","277924":"i ve always had a sensitive stomach , so it was probably something like too much cheese on the egg sandwich i ate this morning , or the egg didn t sit with me the right way .","277925":"sure , that s fine . i m okay though , it s just a digestive problem that i have right now that ll probably clear up in a few hours . as for covid , i barely leave the house as it is and i always wear a mask when i do go out .","277926":"uh , my hyundai is only years old , lol . i ve never been into cars at all , so it doesn t matter to me really . as long as it s reliable and good on gas , then i don t care .","277927":"i don t really think that s unreasonable , no . however , i m the really the best person to ask this because i ll probably never have children , so it isn t a situation i would ever be in .","277928":"yeah , i ve heard of that . there s no reason for me to make sure with my insurance company because i don t have covid .","277929":"amsterdam , london , venice , moscow , madrid , and portland .","277930":"i m not sure , it isn t something i ve ever had to think about so i never called my insurance to make sure . i ve never had covid from my knowledge .","277931":"there isn t a deep significance to me . they re just my favorite animal .","277932":"no , i only clocked out of work minutes ago . i still feel rather unwell .","277933":"i ve never heard of them before .","277934":"lol , considering i haven t had sex in almost a year , that s impossible .","277935":"last august , when my ex and i broke up .","277936":"more like diarrhea to the point where i was using the bathroom every minutes .","277937":"no , i m pretty sure digestive issues aren t a symptom of covid . if i had covid , i would be having trouble breathing and a high fever , from my understanding .","277938":"i went to the dealership in to look at cars , and i knew i wanted to have a hyundai just didn t know what model . i ended up making a spontaneous decision there and walked out of the dealership with a new car , haha .","277939":"i m not really sure , tbh . i ve always had a fascination with wolves ever since i read the book white fang by jack london when i was a child . i feel connected to them somehow , so i have a few decorative items in my room of wolves and i even have a tattoo of a wolf .","277940":"mentally , i feel pretty good . however , i feel physically sick i actually clocked out of work early because i was running to the bathroom all morning and barely got any work done . right now , i m taking this time to settle down , hydrate , and possibly nap later .","277941":"no , i m not interested in dating at the moment .","277942":"it s a .","277943":"the little things in life motivate me , such as having a cup of coffee when i wake up in the morning , seeing my friends , going outside and reading when it s beautiful out , and listening to good music .","277944":"lol , this is something i m not comfortable sharing on askfm because it was honestly a very horrible , morally corrupt thing that i did to someone .","277945":"i have a hyundai accent .","277946":"yeah , that isn t weird to me at all . i honestly don t remember my first kiss very well . i just know it was with my first girlfriend . my first legitimate date was with my most recent ex when i was years old . we went to the movies and then out to dinner afterwards . we had several great dates since then , including our second date which was going to the beach together , listening to music , discussing our favorite bands , and just generally connecting and getting to know one another .","277947":"uh , this makes absolutely zero sense . i m not answering any more of these statements .","277948":"i don t believe there s anything that i want people to know more about in terms of myself . i m very open to a certain degree , and i don t talk about things that make me feel uncomfortable . i only reveal online the things that i m comfortable sharing to the public .","277949":"i ve always liked parcheesi , haha . i don t play board games very often at all . i can t remember the last time i did .","277950":"i don t consider myself special or intelligent enough to go so far as to say that there s one particular thing that only makes sense to me . everything that i know is knowledge that is shared by other people , and even in terms of myself , some of my close friends understand me better than i understand myself .","277951":"i wouldn t be able to put a percentage on it . i m fairly open about myself online for the most part , but there are some things i don t talk about , such as when i m having a bad mental health day . i also don t discuss my family or friends very often .","277952":"black hole sun by soundgarden .","277953":"it depends on the individual . some people place importance on sex , while others don t .","277954":"i don t really like either of their music .","277955":"no , i m a terrible dancer .","277956":"myself , haha . i constantly second guess myself , my thoughts , my behavior , etc etc . i always wonder if i m doing the right thing or if what i ve said to someone hurt or offended them in some way .","277957":"yes , she s a very talented artist . if you go onto her askfm page , i think she has her redbubble listed or you can ask her for the link , it s where she has most of her art and you can purchase various items with her artwork on it . cc shehitsback","277958":"that . . . isn t how it works , lol . i would rather be safe and protect myself and other people during this crisis .","277959":"shehitsback ! !","277960":"the only thing i know is that i m a scorpio . i m not much into astrology and don t put much faith into it .","277961":"a tank top and pajama shorts , lol .","277962":"yes , it s pretty much mandatory where i live . you won t be allowed in stores or anything if you re not wearing a mask .","277963":"facebook , lol .","277964":"that wouldn t offend me , no . if i said i wasn t in the mood , then he can just take care of himself .","277965":"lol . she isn t my best friend either , she s just a good friend of mine . we kinda disconnected after high school but we ve gotten closer in the last years .","277966":"? ? ? we ve never had a falling out before , lol .","277967":"i don t play sports . if i have to watch a sport , it would be ice hockey .","277968":"lol . she s just a friend . we re still friends to this day .","277969":"my friend posted these photos online from i was in these photos , lol . i don t even recognize myself , i feel like i ve totally changed . . .","277970":"they weren t my friends , they were my coworkers friends and family . i m not really sure how old they were . i listen to the sales calls to get more information for the articles i write , and sometimes the sales representatives reveal personal info to the client . i ve heard a few of them say that they had family members and friends pass away from covid . it s so unreal and hard to wrap my head around . long island was the epicenter of covid for a while , which is why all of that happened . but pretty much everyone at this point knows someone or more who has had it .","277971":"drinking some wine ask me interesting questions ! !","277972":"why wouldn t that be acceptable ? that s usually how sex works one person asking the other , lmaoo .","277973":"over the past few years , i ve become more of a morning person thanks to being required to wake up early for work . i like getting up early in the morning and being productive it helps my mental health a lot .","277974":"never thought very much about it before , so i don t have one .","277975":"i prefer showers . i don t like taking baths because i get bored super quickly , haha

obligation . if you don t have the money to spend at a particular time , then there s nothing wrong with that . my ex and i only really spent money on each other when we knew we had the spare money to do so , and also most of the time , we would spend it on different vacations and day trips as opposed to material items .","278002":"a payroll ? i m not sure what you mean by that .","278003":"i m at a stage of my life where if i were looking for a potential partner , i d prefer to date someone who s financially stable with a job and possibly their own place . they re responsible in that they pay their bills on time , etc etc . money didn t really play much of a factor in my past relationship because we both had a firm grasp on our finances i . e . we knew when to spend it and when not to spend it , and if we were low on money , we d do our best to conserve it by not going out and whatnot . we d take turns paying for things for one another depending on who was more stable in that

much or as little information about their personal life that they feel comfortable revealing . no one is obligated to know everything , that s a rude assumption people make whenever someone posts

and .","278022":"yeah , especially lately considering my undercut is like . . . inches long at this point , haha . it s quite annoying . i just put up with it , it s not as if i m going out in public most of the time anyway .","278023":"is there anyone you can talk to about these feelings , i . e . a close friend or partner or doctor or therapist , etc etc ? it s better to talk about these emotions rather than hold them in , otherwise it s just going to get more intense . i understand how you feel though . even though i take my medication every day , my episodes have been happening more frequently mainly emptiness and anger . it s frustrating .","278024":"depends on how they look regarding the rest of their face body , as well as their attitude and how they carry themselves . as an aside , i sorta had silver hair at one point but it was interlaced with blue at the same time . it was a cool , wintry blue .","278025":"i have in the past , but it s something i ve been trying not to

of times i laughed is something i haven t felt in a very long time . it was great to get the crew back together .","278027":"the band linkin park changed my life when i was a teenager . i was extremely depressed , destructive , and s icidal , and when i discovered their music , it resonated with me so much and became a source of comfort for me . the music and the band members themselves

.","278046":"no , not at all . porn introduces a skewed idea of what sex is like , and what they show in porn is nothing like having actual sex with someone . it doesn t teach anyone anything , and it s harmful as hell .","278047":"aw , thank you ! !","278048":"if i was , it wouldn t surprise me . and yeah , i was very skinny back in the day .","278049":"this is , also , extremely cryptic . if you

pretending , right ? it doesn t represent how sex actually happens between couples , and porn also contributes to the trafficking rates in the united states .","278057":"porn is fake .","278058":"i m

?","278070":"look at all of these f cking pigs , what the hell .","278071":"men aren t oppressed because of their gender . meanwhile , women have been oppressed k lled for being women for centuries because of men .","278072":"i think i usually chose peach , haha .","278073":"i ve always been terrible at mario kart , lmaoo . although rainbow road was my favorite track and the most frustrating ! . the bananas angered me a lot , but i loved using the lighting bolt on other people .","278074":"nope , men aren t oppressed because of their gender . meanwhile women are oppressed because of their gender every day .","278075":"what the hell . ? hating women is wrong , point blank . this is getting quite trollish , so i m not partaking in this conversation anymore .","278076":"my argument is you can t judge an entire group of people based solely on the ones you know from that group . i . e . if you know women who are insecure , then that doesn t automatically mean all women are insecure . it s just common sense .","278077":"lmaoo . you re honestly just trying to justify your hatred for women at this point . get out of here with this nonsense .","278078":"if you want to go down the logical fallacy route , then sure but the only reason why you re here is because i said something you personally disagree with , based on your own experiences with women . it appealed to your senses , and you figured you could make ease of an afternoon discussing this knowing full well that your opinion is wrong .","278079":"no , i dislike my body .","278080":"i can say that i dislike nutella because it s disgusting to me . i can t say that all women are insecure simply because only the women i ve met are insecure .","278081":"? ? ? this thread is about women being insecure , and you as a misogynist jump in to offer your opinion . considering it s directly related to the topic at hand , then yes i can criticize your opinion . not to mention the fact that anyone who s proud of being hateful towards women is automatically an idiot . there are also more relationships that cishet and lesbian relationships , lol . you re not taking into account the full gender spectrum where women may be involved . regardless of this , i still stand by the notion that you cannot make such a blanket statement based on your personal experiences and claim it as factual . that s just the way it is .","278082":"you can t make a blanket statement that all women are insecure based solely on your own experiences , lol . that s also taking into account that you re likely referring to cishet relationships , not the plethora of other relationships that exist . either way , it s not as if your word means much to this thread considering you consider yourself a misogynist which is proving to be true . if you re going to try to troll , at least have a reasonable thing to say .","278083":"perhaps later , i m not in the mood to do video responses at the moment .","278084":"probably go to a vineyard with some friends and hang out , drink , and listen to music all day .","278085":"this is definitely a minority of the women out there who are in adult relationships , lol . when you reach a certain point or age in your life , then you find that relationships like that are far and few in between . those are immature relationships between young people , for the most part .","278086":"experiencing something personally doesn t make it factual , lol . insecurity doesn t discriminate by gender . your friends who are men probably do feel insecure , but there s a large stigma placed on men to not express emotion so they likely keep it to themselves .","278087":"i think people in general are insecure because they feel pressured to look or behave a certain way by how our society is . it isn t reserved to just women .","278088":"they can be for a lot of people , yeah .","278089":"i used to back when i went to the gym , but who knows now .","278090":"i m assuming it was a typo for mile .","278091":"definitely not .","278092":"my day has been rather uneventful thus far . i ve only made breakfast and coffee , made my bed , listened to music , and scrolled through social media .","278093":"depends on how bad of a day it was . sometimes i like venting to a friend about my day , other times i need to be alone and just sleep it off .","278094":"i think it was a mattress , lol .","278095":"no , it was just a regular selfie .","278096":"i woke up later than usual this morning , lol . i didn t get out of bed until like am .","278097":"depends on what they did and if how they ve grown and changed since then .","278098":"i think this is gorgeous .","278099":"in case this account gets deleted banned for whatever reason .","278100":"no , they re slightly different . everyone is judgmental to some degree , it s just innate to who we are as humans . you can be open minded in that you can view things from different perspectives , but also judgmental in the aspect that you do form a judgment on someone at first glance which is normal .","278101":"you don t sound clingy , no . i understand how you feel , and if it s something that bothers you , you should try opening up a line of communication with your boyfriend discussing these feelings and how you would like to see him more often if you haven t tried that already . it doesn t mean you re clingy or too much . your feelings are justified .","278102":"i suppose when someone first meets me , they find it difficult to believe that i struggle with a lot of mental health problems . i m often in either an angry , depressive , manic , or just a weird paranoid state with no in between unless i had just taken a xanax , or something . i give off the appearance that i m stable , especially around those who don t know me and don t need to know that part about me , but i m a lot more unstable that i give off . i just seldom discuss it when i m in that state of mind .","278103":". what s the point ? . what s the point ? . what s the point ?","278104":"no , that wouldn t bother me at all because i am very much that person , lol . i require a lot of alone time where it s just me doing what makes me comfortable without other people , including whoever i m dating in that moment . my ex was like that too while we were dating . we both required alone time , so we only saw each other maybe times per week along with our work schedules being opposite , etc etc . it wasn t unusual or bad if one of us were to say , hey , i don t feel like hanging out today . i just want to be alone .","278105":"this is difficult for me to answer because how i behave around other people changes depending on what sort of group i m around . different groups of friends make me act in different ways it s a bit hard to explain . i notice i m more outgoing around one group of friends than others , and other groups of friends , i m more reserved and quiet .","278106":"this was me in , so i was years old .","278107":"i ve been reading books since i was a toddler , so i honestly have no idea what the first book i spent my own money on was . that would have been ages ago , lol .","278108":"i don t know if i want children in the future or not . it s something i ve always been undecided on .","278109":"if something is minor , then it usually doesn t bother me much unless the behavior is repeated . i ve forgotten a lot of different minor incidents in the past because they were minor and i didn t think much of them at all .","278110":"one of my coworkers giving me attitude via email yesterday , smh .","278111":"my favorite animals are wolves .","278112":"i don t really experience much negative energy , but i am stressed a lot of the time . i normally relieve that stress by listening to music , drinking , playing video games , writing , and sleeping .","278113":"lately , it s been playing video games with my friends . we ve been playing almost every night this week , and it has really cheered me up just interacting with them , playing the game , having fun , laughing , etc etc .","278114":"i have before in the past , but that was when i was already with my friends so i didn t have a reason to keep my phone on me . i think if i m with friends for the entire day , then i could definitely spend the day without my phone at all .","278115":"i forgive , but i don t forget . however , it really does depend on the situation . sometimes i don t forgive at all and i cut that person out of my life with no strings attached .","278116":"i ve always liked bathrooms that have a natural element to them , i . e . stone and wood with big windows assuming other neighbors cannot look in and see . i like stand up showers with a bench in them , those look super relaxing .","278117":"i would much rather be able to take back anything i ve said . i don t really think before i speak sometimes in terms of how i say things , so it can come off as insensitive or not with the same tone as i initially intended .","278118":"i ve never cursed anyone out to their face , lmaoo . but when someone does something that frustrates or inconveniences me , then i ll curse them in my head .","278119":"i would learn how to sing well .","278120":"nah , i m good .","278121":"consult a friend and ask for advice . i normally can make decisions such as these on my own , but if i m having a very difficult time , then i ll refer to someone else and get their input .","278122":"nah , i m planning on lounging around in pajama pants and a tank top all day . lmaoo .","278123":"i like seafood , but i don t eat it very often . i like salmon and shrimp the most .","278124":"fruit . we have some blueberries and strawberries in the fridge rn . i used to have a container of guacamole , but i ate it all . lmaoo .","278125":"mangoes or strawberries .","278126":"yeah , my friends and i have been stopped by the cops on a few occasions .","278127":"probably football or baseball i live in the united states .","278128":"considering my entire page is in english , yes .","278129":"how about my dinner instead ?","278130":"we haven t even reached phase in new york yet , lol . sure they opened some restaurants , but everyone is required to wear masks and can only take capacity . i d rather not go out to a public place just for fun unless it s safe to do so . especially a bar , considering that s the highest risk there is .","278131":"i d rather not put my life or anyone else s life at risk because of covid , thanks .","278132":"thank you .","278133":"i don t really have set criteria , lol . if a friendship is meant to be , then it ll happen .","278134":"i don t have any weekend plans besides sleeping , doing laundry , and playing video games .","278135":"hello i m all right , just taking a break from work at the moment . it s storming where i live , which makes me very sleepy , haha .","278136":"this is probably my favorite outfit .","278137":"uh , myself ? lmaoo .","278138":"sleeping .","278139":"hello do you have a question ?","278140":"they re just various tank tops . i bought them from amazon .","278141":"autumn is my favorite season .","278142":"happy friday ! ! thank god this work week is almost over . i m currently looking into buying a new laptop i m leaning towards an hp laptop or a lenovo laptop , since both brands are wonderful . i m so terrified that my year old laptop is going to sh t out in me because i use it for hours per day , five days per week . better safe than sorry .","278143":"i m nobody special , lol .","278144":"? ? ? i m not playing with strangers , lmaoo .","278145":"i don t think i ve ever had spaghetti hoops before ? lol .","278146":"xbox one .","278147":"lately i ve been playing a lot of halo reach , so i guess that for now . however , i also love skyrim and the fallout series .","278148":"yes , i love wine . i like sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio .","278149":"i have memory loss , so i have no recollection of a lot of my past memories .","278150":"no .","278151":"open door by mike shinoda https youtu . be vbweeukfrq","278152":"i think it depends on the person and their particular circumstances . what s

a .","278159":"uh , alcohol . lmaoo .","278160":"yeah , i just attributed it to them having a bad day or something .","278161":"i think we re advancing in some areas but deteriorating in other areas .

things that are , and some things that have not yet come to pass .","278163":"i don t believe i have unless central park in manhattan is considered a national park .","278164":"dark humor , as well as really stupid humor . i like horror movies with elements of comedy in them that make you think wow that was f cked up , but i also like really slapstick humor like some of mel brooks movies .","278165":"i don t give out my instagram . if you have a question , you can ask it here .","278166":"i like staying within my comfort zone because otherwise i m very anxious , but there are times where i have to push myself out of my comfort zone in order to progress forward .","278167":"it was a radio show concert in december , some of the acts were death cab for cutie and florence and the machine . however , the main reason why i went was to see mike shinoda .","278168":"depends on the day . i m either content or manic or very sad or extremely angry . i constantly fluctuate between those emotions .","278169":"it s beautiful outside today , so i m spending my lunch break just sitting in my front yard and soaking up the sunshine .","278170":"yeah , i ve written dozens of poems

pretty much anything . i have two best friends .","278238":"when i m feeling as depressed as i have been over the past two days , it s difficult to accept the truth that the feeling will be temporary

hollowness inside of me like someone reached within me and removed a portion of who i am , there s this gaping hole that echoes with my heartbeats . the emptiness is a dark void , and when you re feeling empty , you discover the meaningless of everything around you , even when you re grasping for straws to find meaning in something . in anything . if i had to describe the emptiness in a few words , it would be feeling simultaneously hollow but also numb at the same time . there s a nothingness involved in feeling empty , you re just a shell of yourself .","278241":"i don t believe i m
