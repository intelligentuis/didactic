  Well I already have a short temper and little to no patience with adults so I think the hulk version of me would be scary because if I could just pick up someone causally like off the ground or whatever I’m sure I’d just do it 😂 regular me sometimes I can just sass people but I choose not to most of the time

   Whats your opinion on weed?
  ","
  I personally smoke weed, I have tendonitis in both my knees, hip pain, lower back pain and I often struggle to fall asleep and sometimes I need help eating (like to have an appetite). Personally I think it can be very helpful and effective IF used properly. Some people go around and will do dumb things and blame weed but I’ve never done anything stupid during nor after smoking (no matter how much I’ve smoked) so it’s not all that bad, people just are too stubborn to fully socially accept it.
  "

  Customer service story time from the other day: so typically customers when they first come in they will wear a mask but if we seat them outside they always come back in to ask us things and to get refills without their mask even though we have a “no mask, no service” sign. So I asked a man to please make sure he keeps his mask on his face at all times while in the restaurant and he replied with “why? Are y’all sick are something?” So I responded with “no, but it’s required to be on in our restaurant and if you don’t have it on we can and will refuse you service so it’s up to you” 🤣

  Personally I thought Amsterdam was such a beautiful place 😍 the Dutch are such kind human beings it’s like weird. If any American went there they’d agree, their level of kindness like over exceeds the US. I kid you not someone saw us struggling to get train tickets because none of us read or speak Dutch so someone took time to stop and try to help even though they did not speak a lick of English and we ended up getting the tickets we needed. Another gentlemen stopped out of no where and carried all of our luggage down flights of stairs at another train station. And lastly this gentlemen was just out for what looked like his daily bike ride and he saw all of us somehow and stopped to carry our luggage for us (mind you there were 4 of us with big heavy luggage).

  Usually they’ll discontinue items because they need to meet demands. When a product isn’t selling consistently then they get rid of it for a while to bring in something new. They always bring back what they discontinue at some point but I’m not sure if you can buy it because they probably have 0 in stock due to discontinuing it.

  This happened to me at my last job, so this older lady just got rung up on the register and paid and she had a cart so I offered to take it for her since we had to clean them when customers touched them, she had a very small bag with 1 thing in it that she purchased so I didn’t think she needed it. She ignored me and continued to walk to the door so I thought she didn’t hear me so I asked again very nicely and she got MAD 😂 she ended up shoving the cart into these little baskets  we have knocking them all to the ground and she walked out the door and didn’t bother to help 🤷🏼‍♀️ the life of working retail/ customer service

  Just some food for thought. But someone else in this world doesn’t have it as good as the rest of us, some people don’t even get a slight chance to do things we have the privilege to do. Giving up seems like the easier option but when you choose everyday to power through your mental blocks or your self doubts you will be very successful and happy in life because you earned it. I hope this helps ❤️

  You could get headphones that are so much better from a different brand. Like JBL, BOSE, etc. those will likely be cheaper and the sound will be significantly better. On top of that I’m sure the Apple headphones go out hella fast like they always do so that’s another negative to Apple headphones

  Oh my goodness, so I work at a clothing store and sometimes we have older men/women who come in and when they are at our registers they can sometimes be slow. I had two older women at my register and they were scrambling to find this coupon that they misplaced in their purse. I then told them to take as much time as they need and that there was no rush and that the line of people can wait because I have all the patients in the world. They then told me I had the best customer service which made my entire day ☺️

   Yeah, it is unusual. I think she said it bc she wanted to know if I’d put tribal marks on a half White/African baby. The thing is though, why use herself as the example of my white wife and baby mother? I called her pretty a week prior and she replied with “aww you think I’m pretty “.  Then this? 🤔
  ","
  The sad factor of that is I think she says these things because even still after decades and centuries, a mixed couple is usually still frowned upon in some areas. I would sit her down and let her know how much she means to you if you are actually serious about her. I think in her eyes she wants to make sure that you keep your traditions and make sure she respects your background too. She’s a keeper in my opinion.

  ","
  Listen, it doesn’t matter what I personally think is okay. It’s up to however you feel about the situation. If you don’t want him doing things like that, then express that to him but if you don’t mind then that’s okay too. All about perspective

   Tell me something special that happened in your life?
  ","
  When I was about 16 or so, I was on a competitive cheer team and we had a little girl on our team who was hard of hearing. The older girls were very snotty and would make fun of her or shove her around. So I went up to her mom and learned positive things I can say to her in sign language to let her know someone supports her when we go to competitions or even at practice. Then in high school I was inspired to keep learning ASL and even took college level classes for high school credit as my foreign language ☺️

  This isn’t rocket science guys. You pick what you like and that’s that. I can surely pick for him too but I don’t read minds so if he were to not like it then that would then be on him for not making it clear of what he wants 🙂

Last year he got so depressed, he drunk until he blacked out. I don't want that to happen again. How can i help him feel better?
  ","
  Well losing any parent is very hard. I’m sure for him it’s not easy to have to remember his mom won’t be coming for Christmas, Thanksgiving, 4th of July etc. So I would maybe sit him down and maybe try to get him to talk about how he’s feeling and just listen with no judgement.

  LMAOOOOOO 😂 a go fund me is something YOU set up for YOURSELF asking for help with money issues or whatever you need it for and people donating that money is an OPTION not a requirement. Also if men weren’t so aggressive, and think with their brain before making bad choices they wouldn’t end up there 🤷🏼‍♀️ but that’s just my opinion 😁☕️

   Lately I've been so sexually frustrated that it sucks. It's to the point where she can walk around the house in sweet pants and a tank-top and i get rock hard. I don't make her do anything she doesn't want to do. Jerking off is not helping. How can I get myself to not be so sexually frustrated?

   What’s worse, Someone who lies a lot or someone who can’t ever apologize?
  ","
  This is so hard because I hate both 😂 I’m not sure. I think I could try to get over someone not being able to apologize when they are wrong but the lies would be an issue. For me I personally like when my word means something. Like if I promise someone something they know I’ll do my absolute best to make it happen or whatever the promise was. But if you lie then no one knows if what you’re saying is even true and I can’t stand those people 🤷🏼‍♀️

   What's your take on ""true love"" that one in a lifetime type of love
  ","
  True love isn’t easy to describe because everyone has their own version of what that means, but my take on it would be that true love is hard, you need trust, loyalty, mutual respect, able to laugh until your stomach hurts with them, come to them when you are sad, mad or happy. Be able to be their best friend and their significant other. Even when you fight you could never think of not talking to them or letting them go to bed mad. There’s just so much that comes into play for true love ✨
  "
24501,"
   What kind of people have a therapeutic effect on you and why?

24503,"
   How much time must pass for you to finally feel like you can form an emotional connection with a new person? Why?
  ","
  It depends on the person. For me I don’t trust easily but as long as there is mutual respect and a true bond usually I can trust someone. It took me 2 years to trust my best friend fully 🤠

  ","
  I believe it should be harder for people to access guns, I don’t think we should completely get rid of guns because they protect us plus it is our constitutional right. But I feel like the screening for people to purchase guns could be improved. Knifes I’m not sure what the laws are on those except I know some that are banned.
  "

  I would have said a few “kind” words and made him tell me why in the hell he was in a WOMENS bathroom when he’s NOT a women, and secondly why he felt the need to look under when you can CLEARLY tell when a stall door is closed and the stall is in use 😡

  "
24800,"
   What is the last thing you searched online?
  ","
  Last thing I searched online was searching to see if a food place was open 😂❤️
  "
24801,"
   Do you think people who are over-confident, interactive with many acquaintances are shallow?
  ","
  I don’t see confidence as something negative, if someone is very confident within themselves then that is amazing! Having a lot of friends and or acquaintances isn’t bad either but keep in mind it’s always quality over quantity ✨ but no I don’t think they are shallow unless they are only about themselves
  "
24802,"
   Do you mostly hang out in bedroom or living room
  ","
  I mostly hangout in my bedroom 💫
  "
24803,"
   According to you, why do people love? Or fall in love?
  ","
  Relationships aren’t always for everyone but for the people who decide to be in one I think people fall in love because they spend so much time with one person, they create memories and happiness. We love because we want to be loved, I think people love because life is just too short 💖
  "
24804,"
   Actually 🙏... I want to live and play music in New York as soon as possible. Not to live here in Europe in the middle of nowhere in a disgusting country. How can I do this? I don’t even have parents standing next to me and I don’t have money either🥵I believe in God’s help, but yeah....🥺
  ","
  I’m so sorry to hear that, I hope you achieve your goal and I will make sure to keep you in my thoughts ❤️

  ","
  I remember it was awkward but that’s about it 😅
  "
24807,"
   Can I have your school photo?
  ","
  I don’t have any on me or even near by. I have like one picture of me and an old teacher of mine and I was in my cap and gown but other than that I don’t have any 😂😬
  "
24808,"
   What's the best thing you can purchase for $5?
  ","
  There is this frozen yogurt shop 10 minutes from my house and they do big cups of Hawaiian shaved snow for $4 and it’s delicious 😍🙌🏼
  "
24809,"
   What's the best way to spend $1,000,000?
  ","
  If I were to ever get the chance to spend that much I’d use some of it to give it to my parents then I’d use the rest for things I need over materialistic things 🙌🏼
  "
24810,"
   What is the very last thing you do before you settle in to fall asleep at night?
  ","
  I always love listening to music before going to sleep each night, it’s a nice routine 😸
  "
24811,"
   I see. Why do you think she used herself as the example of my white wife and baby white mother when I’m African?
  ","
  Hm I’m not sure, maybe she wants to include your culture and background In her child’s life, but again I’m not her so I can’t be too certain. I would sit down with her and ask her these same questions as well so maybe she can explain why herself as well!
  "
24812,"
   What supercool connections have you made through the Internet?
  ","
  I’ve actually made internet friends before through social media and some of the connections were amazing with really nice people too 🤠
  "
24813,"
   No, I’m a real person. 100% and this really did happen and I’d like to know your opinion.
  ","
  Hm well then in that case I would say if you aren’t ready to settle down and have a family yet then I would talk with her about it. It would be much easier if you explain where you are coming from and why you feel how you feel. I hope this helps ☺️🙏🏼
  "
24814,"
   Why would a pretty girl ASK ME “what if me and you got married and had a BABY, would you do that baby?”?

  Oh boy, I know these type of questions are always sent in by bots 🙄
  "

   Are you a city or a nature person?

  I feel like I’m more of a nature person than a city person, I like to go on little trails and just enjoy the peace and silence 😌
  "
24816,"

  Thank you so much I just keep us in your thoughts and prayers or just send some positive vibes our way. We are currently in during an extreme ice storm. For the past week and has been freezing temperatures and unusual temperatures where we live at and there is interesting inches of ice and snow on vehicles and on the ground. We're all basically stuck at home not able to go to work or do anything. The power is going off and on and we're having to all struggle to stay warm. We're not used to this type of weather down here so I can understand snow and then it melts but for the entire week we have been having hardcore freezing temperatures ice snow when lightning power outages. Potential fires. Electricity arcing down trees and branches. People trying to rob places and lots of unnecessary vandalism from boredom of people. It's turning into be a really dangerous situation. So definitely keep us in your thoughts everyone!

  Yep... Throughout the day. The power is going off and on again. It is 5 degrees out.. Lines went down and were cooking and arching... Glad we are safe. We had to leave the house for awhile because of that and now we are back. There is like 4 inches of thick ice all other the roads and in the yard i don't even know how deep it is.. But it is nuts.. We haven't been to work in days... Mary-Jane is almost out of her food... Cause everyone freaked out here and bought all the dog food like dumbashes... Like why do you need THAT much dog food for just 6 days? You don't. Greedy and freaking out. Granted this could be much worse. It's not. We are fine. Have food. We are good. Just idiots out robbing and going crazy. Trying to vandalize and stuff. Stupid. Guess nothing better for them to do. I just don't get it. I don't. But all I know is. I want my babies to be safe and warm. I don't even care about me. I just want them safe. We are not made for weather like this down here. Our power lines and stuff. No way.. Just prayers that it warms up a bit.

   Why do we cut our grass?
  ","
  Well... it's especially important for people out on the country to cut their grass because we get wild critters that can eat you and come into your house kill you or your animals. They hide up in the grass... So that's one major reason why we cut our grass. The other reason. Bugs would infest our houses. Another reason is they can't get in and out of our driveways and we can't see over the grass.
  
  Plus Gardens and trees would die and more.
  
  There are multiple reasons to why we country-folk definitely cut our dresses.
  
  People in the city? I think they need to cut their grass for most of those reasons as well but country people got really bad with the animal part and Bug part

It supposed to be like five degrees or like 10 degrees or something. So everybody stay warm cuz I bet you everywhere else is below freezing or worse. Stay off the roads or at least just be careful when you're on the roads. Sweet dreams to all of you!

  Well considering I was in a long-distance relationship for 4 and 1/2 to 5 years and me and my husband didn't see each other for almost 13 months at a time I've kind of been in this position at one point. So yes I could do this. Forever? Honestly yes. When you love someone you love someone

   Absolutely, I never would I have probably considered that, thank you so much 🤩 This is a freakin' INVESTMENT. No silly games here , no doubt. Miami sounds like a steller scene for tats. And, I'm in Florida, so yeah, definitely a strong recommendation. I'm feelin' it! A year in advance tho! Woah!
  ","
  definitely. Even if you ask a few people about this place that I'm talking about you probably can find out where it is but it's extremely expensive but totally worth it because his work is amazing even if it takes a year or so to get into his shop I would definitely consider going there. He also does before appointments to see what you want first before getting it and then he has a second appointment so it will be a process but exciting and totally worth it in the end. At least you will be getting a piece of work and actually getting something beautiful instead of going to someone cheap and it being super fast and not being done all the way and you spending a lot of money. Not saying all tattoo artists other than him or like this now. There are other tattoo artists that are amazing as well

  Oh okay. My apologies there. Well. We were up on the levee back home where I was born and raised and again we were up on the Mississippi Levee. the Mississippi Levee where we were at is located in Louisiana but it's the Mississippi River and we were standing on the Levee. Absolutely beautiful. This is a destination that my grandfather used to go to nearly every single day in the morning and even sometimes in the evening to enjoy its beauty and just to take in the nature, to watch the boats come by and to look at the bridge... the giant skyscrapers  and planes helicopters and more. There were also be periodically different events that happened up here.  But most the time was peaceful and quiet. Awesome place to visit. Unfortunately my grandfather passed away a few years back  plus my grandmother soon after sadly... They mean a lot to me. They partly raised me with my mom. They played a big role in my life. I love my grandparents. but this is a memory that I will always remember about him, my Paw paw and I love going to this place while we were there one day he got down on one knee after making a joke that he saw a trash boat in the water got my attention because I wanted to see it turned back around and he was on one knee asking me to marry him. Which the joke that he made was something similar to what my grandfather would say it was very touching, very sweet and very just emotional altogether. I loved it I couldn't have asked for a better proposal. but altogether I find that very special and I just loved it loved it. That's how my husband proposed to me.

  ","
  well if you want a tattoo done very beautifully and extreme detail I would make sure that you go to a very good artist and make sure that you pay good money to get that tattoo done. And I would look far and wide for a very good tattoo artist. I know there's one in Miami Florida that's extremely good that I definitely recommend but you have to make an appointment with him and honestly his appointments are probably so backed up that you would probably have to make a reservation a year ahead of time. But all I know is make sure that you have a really good artist and make sure that they know for sure how much detail that you want in your tattoo. I would stick around their shop for a few weeks before actually letting them tattoo on you or just check out their work for a couple of weeks and just see if that's the kind of stuff that you want in your skin. The way that they're doing that to people tattoos the detail. It's important to develop a relationship with your tattoo artist as well also in my opinion and which is what I did. But like I said just be careful and make sure you know what you want before getting it. Because it ain't coming off your body unless you want to spend thousands of dollars in laser surgery and honestly one surgery does it fix it and sometimes it never does

  It absolutely is your business because that's the way people come in and try to break into your house and take your things they scout the area and they grab things when you're not looking or come back later and rob the place.. But they will take the stuff and put the stuff in their pockets and then they deny it completely when the stuff disappears and then you see it at their house. Definitely make sure that they let you know that someone's coming over and then you be aware because that's your stuff honestly I'd put all your stuff in your room and I would lock your doors and if they unlock it then I would call the police and let them know that the people that are coming in your home you don't know them at all and you think that they might be stealing from you. But that's only if they go into your room even after it's been locked. I would really be careful with that because there's a lot of people that steal

  I don't think you look bad in your picture. If someone told you that they're dumb Everyone else preference. Don't always ask people for their point of view on something like that. Them judging you by a cover. They're just going to do that judge a book by its cover. They're not going to actually look at the person for who they are. If you're always walking around looking for acceptance from random people if not going to help because you're always going to have people that think you really do look good and get jealous and then want to bring you down and take that happiness away from you. You don't need someone's approval. Just have confidence in yourself

   I am putting together a gingerbread house for the first time, any tips or tricks?
  ","
  Of course use icing and if it's not working very well get a very small bit of water and just dab it on there with your finger and it will loosen the icing up and make it wet and it will be almost like glue. Unfortunately I make gingerbread houses I just can't eat them. But I love decorating them!

  Just depends if we're face-to-face and we're chilling out and talking together I don't mind talking about politics as long as it's civil talk. No arguing or getting angry at each other. State facts only. We can't get too much into our feelings. Morals do take a place but it's not all about feelings all the time. People get to down deep and conspiracy about it and honestly people just need to stick to the basics but now I don't honestly mind talking about politics but only with people that I know. I'm not too fine of talking about just anything with people I have just met

  You do realize you sent the ""Deuces,"" comment out as a shout out? so it's going to send to a bunch of random people. It didn't send to anyone personal. If that's what you were trying to do it sent to a bunch of random people. So.. We aren't gonna know what your referring to. Like I have never commented on your status I have only ever answered the shoutouts that you have been sending out lately and honestly I think I've only answered one or two. So I don't know what you're talking about and why you're angry at me but I haven't done anything to you. Don't really know you.. And again you're using the shout-out feature... it's going to send these messages you're saying out to random people and not to anyone personal.

He was an old military vet and he was having a lot of issues with his family and then he ended up having issues with himself medically. He actually has something really bad happened to him out on the field so that's probably kind of what happened unfortunately. But we miss you military that's what we used to call him we miss you military hope everything's going all right and if you're with the angels hope life still treating you all right!

  ","
  Welcome to the app and the first thing I'm going to say is make sure that you always swipe to open instead of anonymous when you go to answer a question. Basically at the bottom of your page every time you go to answer a question you have to pick whether or not you want to be anonymous or open and you always have to swipe to open if you don't want to be posted as anonymous because it will automatically put you as an anonymous. So if you want to make friends just make sure that you select open to post as open so people can see you. I'm more than welcome to be friends with you. As long as you remain appropriate and you just chill I'm more than welcome to be friends with people I'm pretty open-minded or at least I try my best to be. But again welcome to Ask. FM!

  We are perfectly controlled human beings and we can control anything our body and mind us. Just stop thinking about them simple. Or go talk to them at least. But if you're trying to get over a breakup those are easy just be free be yourself be happy you don't have to worry about anyone anymore

   what do you think of zoos?
  ","
  I don't know as long as they're taking care of the animals right and honestly if you're going to have a zoo it needs to be just rescues. Or something maybe you bread into the place and they're completely domestic but honestly I think any wild animal needs to be out in the wild. I like zoos because of the education that it brings to everyone. But if you're going to go out and get a bunch of animals and take them out of the wild and put them in a zoo in a small cage I don't know about that. Just doesn't sound right in any aspect. But like if they are endangered or something then they need to be watched because there are poachers. There are people that go out and try to kill off the whole species just because people say that they're going out.

  I have a matching tattoo with someone very special. But it doesn't say our names or something.. No. We are gonna get some black in the words more. They have alooot of meaning. If you would like to furtherly know more meaning on the pair of tattoos. Just ask.
  
  Then the 2nd one of the dream catcher compass is just something that just shows my way in life. Guides me. Means God. It also has things that either grown into in my life on the tattoo or it has been a part of my life or it is something that I love a lot. I love geography. I have Indian Heritage and Cajun Heritage. And then the tattoo just means alot to me in general. I love to paint. I try to always be very creative and different in life. It makes me feel special. The tattoo makes me me. Was my 1st one. It is actually reeally really big. Like 10 inch tall and then 6 inches wide.
  
  And then the last one resembles home. Where I was born and raised. It resembles Mardi Gras the culture the tradition and my family. I got this one during this pandemic because it has kept me from my family more than ever in my life. This pandemic has done that to me and my family. Before I could travel a lot but now we have to be more cautious so that means I can't see my family as often as I would like to. Or at least at the beginning the first eight months it was like that. Now it isn't so bad. But yes. I got it for my mom and for my family. I will probably continue on with that tattoo. Because it looks really gnarly.

  Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency created in 2009. Marketplaces called “bitcoin exchanges” allow people to buy or sell bitcoins using different currencies.
  
  Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are made with no middle men – meaning, no banks. Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on Expedia, shop for furniture on Overstock and buy Xbox games. Butmuch of the hype is about getting rich by trading it. The price of bitcoin skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017.
  
  Bitcoins can be used to buy merchandise anonymously.  International payments are easy and cheap because bitcoins are not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Small businesses may like them because there are no credit card fees. Some people just buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping that they’ll go up in value aand that is Bitcoin for ya.

I also throughout my life have done volunteering to help people that have nothing. My family has a food bank back home where I'm from and we have been having that open for any time from 30 to 40 years. It is still going on now. Like I said I worked in retail. I still do. I work at my family store for about seven and a half years they own two different stores back home where I am from.

  I have one little bitty bamboo plant that my roommate left. I honestly want a giant bamboo plant and I would like to have another butterfly bush. That's right I have a butterfly bush I forgot about that. That's another thing another roommate left. I would like another butterfly bush on the other side of the one that I already have. It's been here for about five years and it has bloomed every single year. I love it. It literally attract hummingbirds moths butterflies and certain types of bees. Ones that are usually not harmful. It just attracts the most beautiful insects. And it even makes bunnies come around. But anyway I would like to have a very big bamboo plant and I mean one that's like 3 feet tall and one foot wide. I would like to have another set of cacti. Probably a set of three or four. That's my favorite plant is a cactus. But instead this time I want a giant pot for them so I don't have to keep switching them because of course switching a Cactus is not the easiest thing to do. I'm going to tell you is I had to do it very carefully LOL. I would also like a ivy plant. I want one for right by my door. And then I would like one for my kitchen. And then I would like to have some other plants outside more Windchimes and to hummingbird feeders at least on the front of my porch and two on the side by my carport. I would also like to pecan trees a magnolia tree and a couple peach trees for the backyard. But I doubt that will happen. I will probably be able to get my pecan trees but again it takes about 10 years for them to even become a medium sized tree if that. But that's definitely what I want to get for my yard. And for my house

   I know this is a dumb question but what are the coins for in this app
  ","
  They are there to award people for how will they answer the questions that you send them. How detailed and how will. They are points. 🔥 Every country has a Leaderboard on this app and it numbers from 1 to a hundred. Everyday you have a bucket of coins that you collect from your followers and just random viewers that visit your profile and see your answers that you have been asked from users. Or it can be users that have asked you two questions. But basically you collect coins in a day. And every day that you get coins it adds up for the week and then it ranks you on the leaderboard every day but every week the coin start over basically they stock every day for 7 days. Those 7 Days count for your rank for that week. But the leaderboard updates every 10 minutes but what I'm saying is say you were to get it 25000 coins in a whole week it goes away at the end of the week. But say you were to get 2000 every day for seven days add that together that's how much you would get in a week. But like I said fire is points for ranked in your country on your leaderboard. Your rank is at the top right corner of your profile and so is your country flag. You can also sign up for the VIP program to get extra coins when you complete the tasks weekly. You can do that in your settings. Welcome to Ask. FM.

  depends on how you do it and if you're almost to where you have to go and so are they then you might as well just go ahead and wait unless they're planning on sitting there for like 5 minutes. That's understandable but they're just taking a few seconds to maybe step up to somewhere or maybe they're just trying to get up out of a chair or maybe they're just a little bitty bit slower and driving just give them a second because we do have elderly people veterans and young drivers and just people that need a minute in the world.

  Yep. They only care about themselves it seems. They always want to come to you to vent but when it comes to you wanting to go to them to vent it's a problem aggravating and they don't want to listen or give you any type of advice. And they talk down on you. I have had people do this to me and honestly it's really annoying because why would you come to me to vent but I can't even come to you every once in a blue moon and do it? Because people just don't care. If let you come to me for things then you better allow me to come to you for things or I'm probably going to stop letting you come to me. If this is happening to you I suggest you to do the same thing. Don't always be the one to have to listen and help people. Don't be so nice. Be like oh no no no remember when I tried to come see you well I'm not about to sit here and listen to you and if they want to try to get mad at you be like what how does it feel? I tried to come to you for something and you ignored me and got mad and if they try to tell you something about it just re repeat the exact words they said to you when you had that conversation with them when you came to them to vent. And they will shut up and have nothing to say

   Says I violated term of rules. What did I actually violate? Your supposed to send me a screenshot or something. or the text. Amateurs. I hardly use the poll picture thing, so what was the violation?
  ","
  They have a page that you can go to in the settings where it has all the rules and stuff but you can't post any curse words nothing even slightly offensive honestly. That's just how this fight is. Nothing that has to do with self-harm and they think is even slightly self-harm even tattoos can be self harm quote on quote to sites for some reason. If you cuss in any of your answers or if your questions have curse words in them. If anything is to se*ual or too graphic. It can get flagged. Any violations. You get three tries on the third try you get banned. This is just either get the same friendly information. Hope I helped. By the way I agree with what you said it would be nice for them to send you screenshots of what you did wrong.
