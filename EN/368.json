they are in the video game and internet wise -- i've met barbara dunkelman from rooster teeth productions as well as griffin ramsey, who used to be in rooster teeth and is now a well known wood carver.\n  ","394867":"\n  i don't know who that is, so no.\n  ","394868":"\n  one of my favorite works of art is \"death and life\" by gustav klimt (1915). i think it's a beautiful painting of the juxtaposition of the concepts of life and death.\n  ","394869":"\n  i've had a long history of showcasing artistic works when i was a teenager, and although i've dropped off a lot in terms of art, i believe that a mixed media work would suit me best. i like working with pastels, watercolor, charcoal, and ink the most, and the subject matter would revolve around mental health, stigma, and my innermost feelings.\n  ","394870":"\n  more physicians, psychologists, and psychiatrists should take their time in listening to their patients' concerns and display of symptoms instead of writing them off with a simple prescription and sending them along. there are a lot of doctors who see so many patients that they only allocate 15-20 minutes for each appointment, which definitely isn't enough time to really get a full scope of how a person is experiencing a mental illness.\n  ","394871":"\n  self-medication is normally advised against by medical professionals, but i do know some people who do manage their symptoms of either mental or physical illnesses through supplements or marijuana.\n  \n  it's always best to obtain a professional opinion, of course, but if someone is going down the dark road of turning to drugs and alcohol as self-management, then that's extremely unhealthy and can lead to further deterioration of their ailments.\n  ","394872":"\n  i believe it's acceptable to self-diagnose simply cases of depression or anxiety because those signs are easy to tell, and a simple general practitioner can diagnose those issues right away and refer a patient to a specialist.\n  \n  however, when it comes to more complex disorders (i.e. personality disorders), it's wrong to self-diagnose and claim that you have a certain disorder when you haven't been professionally diagnosed with that disorder. many symptoms of mental illnesses are co-morbid, so your own interpretation of your illness may be entirely different from what a professional can ascertain after a psychological evaluation.\n  ","394873":"\n  yes, it's extremely inappropriate to assume whether or not a person is disabled. it's also inappropriate to judge someone based on the status of their disability -- people are human regardless of their ability or disability, and to discriminate against someone because of their health is ableism.\n  ","394874":"\n  i'm always open to learning more about both physical and mental disabilities, particularly with an emphasis on such mental illnesses as personality disorders, psychotic disorders, and dissociative disorders.\n  ","394875":"\n  i know a few people who are disabled, on both a physical aspect as well as mental aspect. i know people who are on disability benefits for both mental and physical illnesses, and i spent a good two years of my life working at a law firm where i directly advocated for the equal treatment of those who are disabled.\n  ","394876":"\n  mental illness can be a disability, so yes. there are physical disabilities and mental disabilities, so there's really no separation between mental illness and disability since mental disabilities are just as debilitating as physical disabilities.\n  ","394877":"\n  without a doubt, yes. there are still so many people who believe that mental health is not as severe or important as physical health -- but what those people do not know is that mental health often manifests itself in physical symptoms as well. mental health is just as physical as other physical ailments.\n  ","394878":"\n  i struggle with several mental illnesses, so my main source of treatment is through psychiatric medication. i also attended intensive therapy for three years on a weekly basis until my therapist quit her job.\n  \n  now that i don't have therapy, i've been relying on my friends more often for support and reaching out to others when i'm not feeling mentally well.\n  ","394879":"\n  yes, there's an immense stigma still surrounding mental health. the stigma has been lifted somewhat in recent years due to increased advocacy and awareness of illnesses, but there are still a significant number of people who hold close-minded views regarding mental illness, whether out of willful ignorance or being uneducated.\n  \n  it's detrimental to mental health as a whole -- we *all* have mental health, and millions of people struggle with mental illness. it's something we all need to talk about.\n  ","394880":"\n  \"and though i can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, i simply am not there.\"\n  \n  -- american psycho (2000)\n  ","394881":"\n  no, i haven't set any short-term goals because the future is incredibly uncertain right now, and i'm already emotionally exhausted as it is. i've been trying to live in the present moment and take each day as they arrive.\n  ","394882":"\n  look at this loveable chonk. :'))\n  ","394883":"\n  sorry for the terrible angle, but i don't feel like getting out of bed for a better photo, lmaoo.\n  \n  this is a painting my ex commissioned for me from our friend, who's a terrific artist and musician. it's my favorite piece of art that i own.\n  ","394884":"\n  the look of love & admiration on the person's face when they're looking at you; receiving texts of love and appreciation at random moments during the day or week; small gestures of affection when i'm feeling particularly down; emotional intimacy and having the feeling that i'm innately understood; and cuddling with someone with whom you feel safe.\n  ","394885":"\n  having trust issues is generally bad, but i also have severe trust issues as well. however, it's something you have to resolve within yourself and with the support of people close to you -- you can't go from not trusting others to trusting people in the snap of a finger, and it's also just as bad to be *too* trusting of others as well.\n  ","394886":"\n  there's really no such thing as an \"opposite\" gender because more than two genders exist. regardless, people can certainly maintain friendships with people outside of their own gender or sex, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n  ","394887":"\n  sometimes you just have to put yourself in then uncomfortable position of speaking in front of people in order to feel more comfortable doing it.\n  \n  it would probably be best to ease those students into it, i.e. having them do a speech one-on-one and then increase the number of people in the audience.\n  ","394888":"\n  i don't even remember when i said i've been in love twice, lol. either way, my point still stands. i don't think i was in love with either of my other exes, i was extremely young and didn't really know what love entailed.\n  ","394889":"\n  i'm just as mature as other people in my age group.\n  ","394890":"\n  if i said that i've been in love twice before, then it's probably because i realized that the \"love\" i thought i felt wasn't being in love at all.\n  \n  there's nothing wrong with changing your mind on things, especially as we grow older and learn more about ourselves.\n  ","394891":"\n  i've fallen in love

i saw in the theatre.\n  ","394898":"\n  most of my favorite movies i've seen at least 4-5 times. they're considered comfort films for me, and it brings me a lot of joy watching them.\n  ","394899":"\n  i prefer watching movies at home -- that way i can pause it whenever i need to, get a refill on food and drinks, etc etc. it's also much cheaper because movie theatres in my area are ridiculously expensive.\n  ","394900":"\n  yes !! historically accurate movies are among my favorites, especially period pieces.\n  ","394901":"\n  i'm not much of a fan of horror anymore because it increases my paranoia and anxiety, but i do enjoy thrillers and gore movies.\n  ","394902":"\n  yes, i have one of those \"smart\" televisions. i have amazon prime, netflix, hulu, and HBO on there.\n  ","394903":"\n  if i think i'll dislike a movie, i don't usually watch it at all. however, when i was in high school, napoleon dynamite was all everyone talked about -- i absolutely hated it, lmaoo.\n

haha.\n  ","394915":"\n  i don't think my social habits have changed much, tbh. the only difference i think is that i'm sh*tposting more on facebook than anything else, lmaoo.\n  ","394916":"\n  i

definitely envision myself living in one.\n  ","394918":"\n  even after the coronavirus slows down and halts, and restrictions are lifted, i still believe people are going to be extremely cautious

actually. however, the last app i installed was zoom so that i could have video chats with friends and coworkers.\n  ","394942":"\n  honestly? coffee and nicotine.\n  ","394943":"\n  yes and no. i'm grateful that i live on my own with two roommates, have a job, and make enough money to be comfortable at the moment. however, there are still several aspects of my life that i'm not happy with and i want to improve on those aspects.\n  ","394944":"\n  not really, no. i align with many aspects of scorpio, but i don't really place much faith in astrology in general. i have a few friends who are really interested in their signs and placements and how it's interpreted into their personality, and i find it to be interesting too. i just don't necessarily believe in it.\n  ","394945":"\n  sweeney todd is pretty inspiring to me, not going to lie. lmaoo. i love the grim, dark atmosphere of the movie and the taboo subject matter.\n  ","394946":"\n  no, i've never stood anyone up on a date before. i've also been on only a few dates in my entire life.\n  ","394947":"\n  i see myself getting married in the future, yeah. it isn't a priority for me at the moment, though. i'm not even interested in dating right now.\n  ","394948":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 28 years old.\n  ","394949":"\n  occasionally, sure. that's fairly normal and common among most people.\n  ","394950":"\n  i've dyed my hair pretty much every color besides green. i believe my favorite colors thus far have been dark red, electric blue (which also had a hint of silver), pink, and dark brown with blonde highlights.\n  ","394951":"\n  my natural hair color is a dirty blonde\/light brown -- almost like a mousy brown. you can see it somewhat in my current profile picture because the side of my head that's normally shaved has grown out quite a lot.\n  ","394952":"\n  depends on what the message entails. i answer most questions that are given to me unless they're inappropriate, trolling, or not necessarily a question.\n  ","394953":"\n  i have naturally straight hair, but as it's been growing longer, it has been taking on a wavy texture, which i love !!\n  ","394954":"\n  i seldom wear makeup unless i'm going out at night to the bar or something with my friends. i applied makeup last friday night for a zoom video session with my coworkers for a \"virtual happy hour,\" but prior to that, it's been months since i've used makeup.\n  ","394955":"\n  i have seven tattoos !!\n  \n  the one pictures below is one of my favorites, haha. i love traditional style tattoos and want to get more of them.\n  ","394956":"\n  when i was commuting to work in the morning, it would normally take me 15 minutes or so in order to get dressed, freshen up in the bathroom, pack my lunch, and take my medication.\n  \n  however, now that i've been working from home, i literally roll out of bed, turn on my computer, make a pot of coffee, and sit down to work. lmaoo. it takes maybe 5 minutes in total.\n  ","394957":"\n  i've only been to one country outside of the united states, so i don't know much about most countries in order to determine what a favorite would be.\n  ","394958":"\n  i'm not quite sure what you're referring to, but regardless, anything that has the word \"tall\" in them sounds incredibly uncomfortable.\n  ","394959":"\n  i used to solely wear converse when i was a teenager, but i haven't owned a pair in several years.\n  ","394960":"\n  i honestly don't remember, haha. i barely remember my gym classes and i seldom participated.\n  ","394961":"\n  no, i've never been on the news before.\n  ","394962":"\n  fruit snacks are delicious, but i prefer eating real fruit.\n  ","394963":"\n  i used to be pretty decent at volleyball and i enjoyed playing badminton when i was much younger.\n  ","394964":"\n  i don't like most sports so i don't really have a distinct favorite. however, i tolerate ice hockey the most.\n  ","394965":"\n  i haven't watched the olympics in a while, but i used to enjoy the ice skating competitions and gymnastics.\n  ","394966":"\n  on a historical level, i think it's disappointing because the olympics is something that has existed for over a century. at the same time, however, i believe it's necessary to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.\n  ","394967":"\n  lol, no.\n  \n  fun fact ; i used to play on an adult volleyball team sponsored by the catholic church when i was in my early 20s. it only lasted one summer, but it was pretty fun.\n  ","394968":"\n  ignorant. it's as simple as that.\n  ","394969":"\n  when i lived at my parents' house and it was mild weather, i would walk and job around the block a few times per week. once this pandemic slows down and things get back to a level of normalcy, i'd like to start doing that again.\n  ","394970":"\n  definitely not, LOL. i have absolutely zero stamina for something of that caliber.\n  ","394971":"\n  it's funny (and probably fairly common), but the idea of exercising is daunting to me and it's one of the reasons why i haven't started it back up again. however, i've also noticed that once i get into an exercise routine, i actually do enjoy it and feel proud of myself for doing it.\n  ","394972":"\n  no, i'm not a fan of sports in general. the only sport that i have a slight interest in is ice hockey.\n  ","394973":"\n  yes, i can swim -- although not very well, haha. i used to love swimming when i was much younger.\n  ","394974":"\n  i haven't been exercising lately, but i try to eat healthy on a regular basis. i've also started taking a multivitamin every morning.\n  ","394975":"\n  yeah, sports stars definitely are paid too much money for what they do. i understand that they're talented and sports is a source of entertainment for millions of people, but i believe that people such as health care workers and scientists should be seeing the same level of pay because they're contributing to the betterment of humanity and society every day.\n  ","394976":"\n  in the united states, the biggest sports are football and baseball, closely followed by basketball and hockey.\n  ","394977":"\n  work, video games, and re-watching old television shows that i used to love are definitely comforting to me through this entire pandemic. they allow me to escape reality for just a little while and they give me something to occupy my time.\n  \n  i have fairly unhealthy coping mechanisms, which includes drinking and vaping, but i've also been trying to reach out to friends more often when i'm not doing well.\n  ","394978":"\n  i've only seen howl's moving castle, spirited away, and kiki's delivery service. however, all of those movies are absolutely beautiful and spirited away is my favorite of the three.\n  ","394979":"\n  i would miss working, i'm not going to lie. having a steady routine every day, which includes work, is what keeps me somewhat stable -- and i would probably descend into a deep depression if i didn't have something like a job to occupy my time.\n  ","394980":"\n  for me, it's a little bit of both -- i enjoy my job, but i also take my job seriously because it's the means by which i can afford my life and pay my bills. it isn't my *ideal* job, but my job is definitely something i can see myself doing for quite a few years from now. i feel fortunate to have found a workplace that not only allows me to express my creativity, but allows me to be responsible and have a sense of fulfillment at the end of the day.\n  ","394981":"\n  i'm angry at the justice system in the united states, which often blames and punishes victims of crimes while letting the actual criminals off with less time (or even no time) than they deserve. there's more pressure and discrimination against people of color in the united states when it comes to arrests by law enforcement, and racial bias is still very strong.\n  \n  as for the state of new york, i'm angry that the board of elections canceled the presidential democratic primary elections that was supposed to happen in late june. we can't even do mail-in ballots.\n  ","394982":"\n  if we're going personality-wise, i'd probably choose a sloth. lmaoo. they're also incredibly adorable creatures.\n  \n  however, i've also always wanted an axolotl. they're such interesting animals.\n  ","394983":"\n  i'm not afraid of the mistake itself, but i'm afraid of the consequences of those mistakes, whether the consequences are from a higher-up in a professional sense or my own expectations.\n  \n  mistakes are human. we all make mistakes, and most can be forgiven. however, i have such a high expectation of myself that when i do make a mistake, i beat myself up for it.\n  ","394984":"\n  i feel as if i was born in the right era, yeah. when i was younger (teenage ages) and more naive, i was always that type of person to say, \"i'm an old soul -- i was born in the wrong decade!\" until i realized how silly that sounded.\n  \n  if anything, my clothing style is casual and it most resembles 1990s grunge. but i grew up in the 1990s, so it still fits.\n  ","394985":"\n  very much so !! i have no desire to live in a huge home or mansion or anything extravagant. as long as there's enough room for me, my partner, and some pets, that's good enough for me.\n  ","394986":"\n  i normally use youtube to listen to music while i'm working, which is normally classical music or video game\/movie\/television soundtracks.\n  \n  i also watch achievement hunter and rooster teeth videos, and occasionally markiplier, because i like gaming videos. i also enjoy buzzfeed unsolved.\n  ","394987":"\n  at least 8 glasses per day.\n  ","394988":"\n  do you mean lychee? if so, i've never had it before.\n  ","394989":"\n  i have no idea what that is.\n  ","394990":"\n  yes, i love mangoes !!\n  ","394991":"\n  no problem !! i hope things work out.\n  ","394992":"\n  oh damn. i'm sorry. :\/\n  \n  i'm not entirely sure. there are other sites like askfm called curiouscat and tellonym, but i wouldn't really consider them social media like facebook or instagram.\n  ","394993":"\n  snapchat, perhaps?\n  ","394994":"\n  my weight. i'm trying to convince my roommates to help me take apart the treadmill in the garage and bring it downstairs into the basement so i can start using it again.\n  ","394995":"\n  i've always felt best in neutral, muted tones -- pale green, black, navy blue, burnt orange, etc etc.\n  ","394996":"\n  destroying myself in 30 seconds flat without an utter care in the world.\n  ","394997":"\n  mayonnaise.\n  ","394998":"\n  rules are just guidelines, so ...\n  ","394999":"\n  write something creatively. i've been struggling emotionally for a while now & i need to get it out of my system.\n  ","395000":"\n  no, i've never been a fan of PUBG. i used to watch my ex play with his friends on xbox, and it was really entertaining but i was never interested in playing myself.\n  ","395001":"\n  ~\u00b0~ twilight ~\u00b0~\n  ","395002":"\n  -- checking in on me to see how i'm doing or feeling.\n  \n  -- taking my thoughts and opinions into consideration during discussions.\n  \n  -- having a civil talk about disagreements instead of it escalating to a bad argument.\n  \n  -- encouraging me to pursue my goals and passions regardless of what they are.\n  \n  -- not being afraid to call me out on my behavior if i'm being irrational or problematic.\n  \n  -- taking time to get to know my friends and actually be friendly with them.\n  \n  -- reassuring me and comforting me when i'm having a particularly bad mental health day.\n  ","395003":"\n  no, i disagree. a problem can still be a problem even if someone doesn't make it out to be a problem at all, and that normally happens in cases when people are ignorant, afraid, or insecure. just because they don't emphasize that it's a problem to them doesn't erase the fact that it's problematic.\n  ","395004":"\n  i live on long island and the stereotypes are often that we're rude and entitled, are incredibly wealthy, move faster than the speed of light, and are basically either italian, jewish, or both.\n  \n  most of those are true, considering a lot of people born here are taught to be fast paced in their lifestyles. sometimes that can be interpreted as rude, and some people are rude, because they just want to get to where they need to be and do their business as quickly as possible. however, the only wealthy people live either on the very north shore or really far east (like the hamptons), and a large majority of us are just middle class.\n  ","395005":"\n  i've never envisioned myself having a large wedding. something quaint in the woods or on the beach with a limited number of people is fine by me. i'd rather have a band over a DJ, the decorations on the table (like flower arrangements and whatnot) would be hand-made, and it would have a rustic feel to it.\n  ","395006":"\n  depends on my mood in that moment. right now, i feel like a 2 because i'm an utterly trash person. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","395007":"\n  not really, no. dogs are products of their environments and even breeds that have a bad reputation are usually incredibly sweet, loving pets.\n  ","395008":"\n  i really value my friendships with\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  ,\n  \n   @CelineM96\n  \n  ,\n  \n   @ManicMartyrdom\n  \n  ,\n  \n   @dieselmom\n  \n  , and\n  \n

evanescence, korn, limp bizkit, audioslave, orgy, alice in chains, def leppard, motley crue, my chemical romance, sum 41, brand new, and taking back sunday.\n  ","395010":"\n  this really confused me this morning because it's tuesday where i live, lmaoo.\n  \n  -- \"maria\" by two feet.\n  \n  -- \"coming undone\" by korn.\n  \n  -- \"my demons\" by starset.\n  \n  -- \"someone you loved\" by lewis capaldi.\n  \n  -- \"twisted\" by missio.\n  ","395011":"\n  at the moment, we all should adhere to the CDC and WHO guidelines in maintaining social distance, self-isolating, only going out for necessary items, and wearing proper masks and gloves.\n  \n  the people protesting for businesses to open are ridiculous and they're only going to prolong the existence of this virus and possibly even cause a second wave. we all want to return to a sense of normalcy, but we also need to listen to the professionals who are urging us to stay home.\n  ","395012":"\n  every age i've been have had its high and low points, so it would be impossible for me to choose one specific age.\n  ","395013":"\n  no, that's actually never happened to me before. i don't really post as often as other people on my friends list do.\n  ","395014":"\n  my own self destructive tendencies, lmaoo.\n  ","395015":"\n  everything else besides my hair, eyes, and cheekbones.\n  ","395016":"\n  my hair -- although right now, it looks terrible and my undercut is completely grown out. i feel my best with a freshly shaved head.\n  ","395017":"\n  i actually have pretty decent time management skills, and i'm able to divide my time up to make the most out of my work days.\n  ","395018":"\n  you need to heed my words and realize that your desires are unwarranted, unnecessary, and unrealistic.\n  \n  i won't be responding to these inquiries anymore.\n  ","395019":"\n  like i stated twice already -- i have no interest in talking to you.\n  ","395020":"\n  ???\n  \n  no, you don't. that doesn't change anything either. i couldn't care less about your feelings towards me.\n  ","395021":"\n  apparently you don't understand that i have zero interest in talking.\n  \n  if you wish to ask me a question, do so here on askfm. otherwise, i have nothing else to offer.\n  ","395022":"\n  i don't think i would do anything differently, tbh. i'm happy with the outcome of my schooling. the only thing i can think of is perhaps continuing my education to get a master's degree, but i wouldn't know what i would pursue and it would only add onto the debt i already owe.\n  ","395023":"\n  school was typically easy for me in the aspect that i didn't really need to study in order to do well. however, my college days were also stressful but those were mainly due to external factors.\n  ","395024":"\n  both my instagram account and facebook account are private. i don't give out my URLs.\n  ","395025":"\n  i miss learning and sitting in lectures, but school itself was rather stressful for me. i did, at one point, juggle a job as well as college but i don't think i'd be able to handle that anymore.\n  ","395026":"\n  i'm five feet tall.\n  ","395027":"\n  you're speaking with me now. if you have a question, feel free to ask.\n  ","395028":"\n  lately all i've been doing is playing video games and watching television. on occasion, i also like to read, draw, and paint as well.\n  ","395029":"\n  i'm fairly talented at writing, but there's always room for improvement.\n  ","395030":"\n  perhaps my x files poster and skyrim map, both of which hang on my wall? haha.\n  ","395031":"\n  i'm sincerely hoping you mean message.\n  \n  regardless, i'm not interested.\n  ","395032":"\n  hazel\/green depending on the light.\n  ","395033":"\n  my instagram is private.\n  ","395034":"\n  i'm not that much of a jealous person anymore, although i used to be when i was younger.\n  ","395035":"\n  yes, i have netflix, hulu, and amazon prime.\n  ","395036":"\n  yes !! haha, they were very short lived.\n  ","395037":"\n  i don't have one particular favorite color, but i like earth tones the most (i.e. forest green, navy blue, maroon, black, gray, and dark purple).\n  ","395038":"\n  i'm a scorpio.\n  ","395039":"\n  LOL, omg i remember that completely. i don't think people in the US had those capabilities, though i could be wrong.\n  ","395040":"\n  i never got detention when i was in high school. however, i did serve one day of in-school suspension for a really ridiculous reason (we were supposed to keep our ID badges visible at all times and a security guard caught me with my ID in my pocket instead of around my neck).\n  ","395041":"\n  not while i was in high school, no. however, i ended up skipping a lot of classes when i was a freshman in college and failed out of two classes.\n  ","395042":"\n  my high school wasn't too big on field trips because they didn't have much of a budget, but our senior trip was a boat ride around the statue of liberty, which was pretty fun.\n  ","395043":"\n  i didn't receive any awards, but i was inducted into the golden key national honour society and graduated magna cum laude.\n  ","395044":"\n  while i was in college, i really enjoyed the opportunities i had to take several electives in subjects that weren't necessarily tied to my major topic of study. i took a few psychology, sociology, and anthropology courses and those really intrigued me.\n  ","395045":"\n  my major in college was communications\/professional writing when i attended my second school. when i was a freshman at my first school (a liberal arts college), i majored in creative writing.\n  ","395046":"\n  yes, i graduated from college in 2013 with a bachelor's degree.\n  ","395047":"\n  i was a hard-working student and received A's in most of my classes. i didn't have a big circle of friends because i mostly spent my time doing classwork, and my main goal was to get good grades in order to attend a college out of state.\n  ","395048":"\n  my forensics teacher when i was a senior in high school was my favorite teacher. he was extremely open, honest, and down-to-earth in all of his lessons and he was more of a mentor than a teacher, in all honesty.\n  ","395049":"\n  i absolutely hated calculus, haha. i was always pretty decent at math, but i didn't like the subject at all.\n  ","395050":"\n  my favorite subject in high school was always english. i also really enjoyed a college-level forensics course i took when i was a senior in high school.\n  ","395051":"\n  physically, probably my eyes.\n  \n  emotionally, likely my empathy and compassion for others, as well as my aptitude in creative expression.\n  ","395052":"\n  i'm not interested in boats, so i don't have a dream boat.\n  ","395053":"\n  i just shrug it off -- it doesn't bother me anymore, especially if it's coming from a stranger whose presence is not valuable to my life. i couldn't care less about what someone random thinks about me.\n  ","395054":"\n  my birthday is november 18th.\n  ","395055":"\n  i was born in 1991.\n  ","395056":"\n  good morning !!\n  \n  my plans are to finish working my normal hours, visit my mother to drop off some supplies for her, order or cook something for dinner, and relax with some television or video games tonight.\n  ","395057":"\n  i honestly don't remember -- it's been a very long time. probably when i went out to eat with a coworker last summer & we got a booth outside.\n  ","395058":"\n  nah, i seldom visit manhattan. i've honestly never heard of the place before.\n  ","395059":"\n  i keep my phone on my bed while i sleep, but that's only because it needs to be close to me in order for me to hear my alarm go off in the morning.\n  \n  with the exception of the past few nights, i don't normally wake up in the middle of the night at all.\n  ","395060":"\n  i currently live with two roommates.\n  ","395061":"\n  it's dark outside & i can't hear any rain, so maybe not? i haven't left the house in 10

LOL.\n  ","395066":"\n  maybe i'm just on the older side, but i'm not sure what trap music is, lol. i mainly listen to alternative rock, hip hop, nu-metal, indie rock, and some pop songs.\n  ","395067":"\n  i wouldn't go so far as to say \"hate,\" but i've definitely gotten annoyed with a lot of songs after a while because of how much they were overplayed.\n  ","395068":"\n  i just googled it and apparently her solo album is coming out may 8th. i want to say i heard one of her singles on the radio weeks ago, but i honestly can't remember.\n  ","395069":"\n  90% of the time, i'm

haven't written fanfiction since like ... 2009. lmaoo. i honestly have no idea.\n  ","395071":"\n  correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't she already coming out with a solo album? i thought i read that somewhere.\n  \n  either way, i think she has a terrific voice so i'm sure she'd succeed as a solo artist.\n  ","395072":"\n  i don't remember ever listening to them.\n  ","395073":"\n  yeah, i used to like paramore a lot in the early 2000s. i saw them perform live at a small venue on long island before they really became ridiculously popular.\n  ","395074":"\n  haha!! that reminds me of

that was around 2003-2004. but those memories are mostly hazy, at this point.\n  ","395081":"\n  no, i thankfully haven't gotten the virus. i've been self-isolating since my job started us all working from home, and both of my roommates have been doing their best to be safe as well (they're both essential workers).\n  \n  i know *a lot* of people who have been diagnosed, though, and thankfully they recovered. unfortunately, a few of my coworkers know people who have died though. :\/\n  ","395082":"\n  oh, i just googled what a \"rage meme\" was and that was evident 20 years ago, lol. it was from

you, then that's on you.\n  ","395090":"\n  i'm not wrong. your hypotheticals are just ridiculous and i don't appreciate the condescending attitude. therefore, this conversation is over.\n

being safe, at least !!\n  ","395095":"\n  i can see both aspects of it. on the one hand, it's necessary for essential workers to get to work. however, on the other hand, you're correct -- it's

several tattoos and only one of them really bothered me.\n  \n  emotional pain, not so well. i'm naturally an extremely emotional person so i feel things much more deeply than some others, and when i'm feeling negative emotions, i become fairly destructive.\n  ","395453":"\n  thrillers and dramas, mostly. i also like fantasy sometimes, but i'm a bit picky as to what i'll read.\n  ","395454":"\n

get embarrassed easily in front of other people, especially my friends, lol.\n  ","395483":"\n  drinking, smoking, sleeping, etc etc. these days, my coping mechanisms haven't been very healthy. the

bunch of nonsensical, illegal sh*t when i was in my early 20s. most of it includes stealing traffic cones & barrels. for no reason other than the fact that we wanted to see if we could.\n

sounds of the rain hitting the window and thunder crashing.\n  ","395488":"\n  no, i've never pulled a fire alarm before.\n  ","395489":"\n  no, i don't.\n  ","395490":"\n  the sexually-charged answers on your page proves otherwise.\n  ","395491":"\n  no, i'm experienced. i get questions about pantyhose every week -- this is no different.\n  \n  if you want to try to fool someone, then leave my page and target someone else.\n  ","395492":"\n  i've been on askfm long enough to know what a fetish question is compared to a regular question. the \"pantyhose\" question is one of the hallmark ones.\n  ","395493":"\n  what on earth makes you think that fetish questions are tolerated on this page (or on askfm in general).\n  ","395494":"\n  not as often as i would like, tbh. i have a really bad habit of picking up a book, reading halfway through it, and then putting it down because something else caught my attention.\n  ","395495":"\n  i make amazing egg sandwiches (either scrambled or over easy). i usually make them on a toasted roll or a croissant with cheese and bacon, as well as salt and pepper.\n  ","395496":"\n  yes, that's extremely selfish and also very rude. you should ideally be happy for your friend and congratulate them, giving them the time they need to celebrate, and *then* when it's appropriate, you can direct the conversation to something you're going through.\n  ","395497":"\n  -- love, whether it's from family, friends, or a partner. having a support system is integral to wellness.\n  \n  -- something that fulfills them, whether it's a hobby or a profession that they love. we all need something in which to divulge that gives us new hope in life.\n  \n  -- spiritual nourishment. regardless of whether or not you're spiritual or religious in the standard sense, we all need a dream or hope or role model from which we derive inspiration.\n  ","395498":"\n  it isn't something i would personally do, but to each his own. it probably would have been more productive to just make that point directly to your boss, find another job in the meantime, and then quit once you had the second job.\n  ","395499":"\n  i shower every other day (washing my hair twice per week), and i change my clothes every day.\n  ","395500":"\n  both !! mostly positive these days.\n  ","395501":"\n  abandonment by my loved ones, as well as enclosed spaces.\n  ","395502":"\n  depends on the individual. some people prefer to keep anonymous on while others are more uncomfortable with it. i like having anonymous questions turned on because a large majority of my questions are asked anonymously & people often ask for my advice while anonymous.\n  ","395503":"\n  oh boy, hahah. i don't think there's anything expired in my fridge rn, except maybe a package of cold cuts from last week (haven't checked the date though).\n  ","395504":"\n  i've been obsessed with true crime documentaries and videos in general, haha. it's all i've been watching for the past few weeks.\n  ","395505":"\n  i'm working for the next 6.5 hours, and then i'm probably going to clean for a little bit, do some laundry, and relax in front of the television.\n  ","395506":"\n  mayonnaise, considering i absolutely hate it.\n  ","395507":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","395508":"\n  within our minds.\n  ","395509":"\n  yes, it's always been relaxing to me to sit outside in the sunshine and soak up some rays. preferably if i'm reading a book.\n  ","395510":"\n  i'm always riding on a sense of overdrive, so my automatic reaction is panic mode. it isn't very reliable.\n  ","395511":"\n  no, not to my knowledge. i only ask questions to people i follow (excluding backup accounts) and no one has ever asked me to unfollow them.\n  ","395512":"\n  i don't follow people on request.\n  ","395513":"\n  it's technically an almond liqueur (disaronno is a brand of amaretto). people sometimes mix it with sour mix, but i like drinking it on the rocks.\n  ","395514":"\n  i'm watching a movie & drinking some disaronno. y'all should ask me questions ~~\n  ","395515":"\n  it's affecting nearly everyone -- staying inside the house isn't ideal for a lot of people, and the whole pandemic atmosphere is incredibly scary and uncertain for many. not everyone has the luxury of staying home either, there are so many people who are essential workers who have to leave their homes and face the unknown every day. it can be extremely damaging for mental health.\n  ","395516":"\n  i'm sorry you're going through this with your friend. quarantine is making everyone do wild things they wouldn't normally do, and if your friend is drinking it will cause him to act out even more.\n  \n  i hope things work out in his favor and he's able to get the help he needs.\n  ","395517":"\n  \"crazy\" is an archaic term used to describe mentally ill people, often in a derogatory fashion. please don't use it.\n  \n  some people may experience cabin fever, but it isn't the same thing as a mental illness. if people are feeling elevated levels of anxiety or depression, then that's unfortunately normal and semi-expected during these times. we're in the middle of a global crisis.\n  ","395518":"\n  no, you're not a bad person for thinking that. obviously the owner wasn't such a good person if they allowed such discriminatory behavior to happen in their business without giving people the proper repurcussions.\n  ","395519":"\n  eh, i wouldn't say it's normal as much as it isn't uncommon. however, even if you do think you're developing feelings for someone on social media, you also have to keep in mind that they're only posting parts of themselves they're willing to share -- not their entire being. you're attracted to a version of them, one that may not be them as a whole, and you have to be careful that you're not filling in the blanks with a fantasy of who you think they are.\n  ","395520":"\n  it depends, but most of the time, yes.\n  ","395521":"\n  sweeney todd -- mainly because i know most of the songs by heart and can sing them in my head while the movie plays on mute.\n  ","395522":"\n  yes, i believe so. some people just aren't interested in love or relationships.\n  ","395523":"\n  i'm indifferent to it, tbh. i like discussing it, but it gets to a point where people start fabricating their own stories about my breakup that causes me to become exhausted about talking about it. a lot of people can't seem to understand that a relationship can end naturally and civil.\n  ","395524":"\n  i'm doing well, but i'm honestly tired. i don't think i slept too well last night, so i'm probably going to call it an early night after i eat dinner.\n  ","395525":"\n  friendship is natural -- it doesn't happen by choice or through force. i'm not really interested in making new friends, at any rate.\n  ","395526":"\n  there was an article posted on facebook about old educational video games from the 1990s making a comeback on steam & it made me really nostalgic !! i haven't thought about those games in probably over 15 years.\n  ","395527":"\n  i've only ever been to one other country, so i'm not entirely sure. i think it would suit me if i lived in england or australia, though.\n  ","395528":"\n  no, you can only talk to me on askfm. all of my social media accounts are private and reserved for friends.\n  ","395529":"\n  my routine hasn't changed much, thankfully, other than not going to stores as often.\n  \n  i've been occupying my time with work, as well as cleaning, playing video games, watching television, sleeping, and i've also been trying to read more and write creatively.\n  ","395530":"\n  yeah, i have a private instagram account.\n  ","395531":"\n  yes, i'm single.\n  ","395532":"\n  -- i'm left handed.\n  \n

treatment. i believe it's best for people to have room to collect their thoughts and then discuss the situation.\n  ","395538":"\n  no, i don't. like i said, i never looked at my family members that way because they're obviously family.\n  ","395539":"\n  it sounds like a backhanded compliment, tbh. you could just simply tell that person that they're attractive, regardless of whether or not they wear makeup.\n  ","395540":"\n  i think the silent treatment is extremely immature and counterproductive. it's much better and more productive to talk things out with others in order to come to a

platonic, and it doesn't make your partner any less of a person by admitting their mistakes.\n  \n  even though you said you tried talking to them about it and nothing changed, perhaps you can approach it from a different angle -- stating that you won't think any less of them if\/when they do apologize, your relationship with them will remain intact, and there's nothing wrong with admitting that they're wrong in some cases.\n  \n  as long as they're not adamant that they're right all the time, i think it's important to try to talk to them again and work through this issue. good luck !!\n

body because i have a certain image that i have for myself that would make me feel comfortable.\n  \n  you're right in that there are obvious stereotypes for men & women, but denying basic biology is silly. it's factual that females grow breast tissue for feeding children and wider hips for birthing children. it isn't unreasonable for me to be uncomfortable with mine.\n  ","395592":"\n  i agree.

that females have wider hips in order to accomodate birth.\n  ","395595":"\n  females naturally have wider hips than males -- my thighs are a result of that. i didn't say that men didn't have thighs,

to the taste of the sauce and cheese.\n  ","395604":"\n  not very often at all -- i'm always around resources where i can do things, like art or writing or reading or playing video games. i have a house that i can always clean and laundry to do. i'm thankful that i'm still working 40 hours per week, so that takes up a majority of my time.\n  ","395605":"\n  i'm sorry to hear that. where i live,

with this woman, though.\n  ","395608":"\n  it's been pretty boring. i woke up around 10:00am or so (which is super late for me) then made coffee & breakfast. i've just been sitting around on social media and talking to friends most of the day, and i also cleaned the kitchen.\n  \n  earlier in the afternoon, i did a face mask, waxed\/tweezed my facial hair, and cut my nails. now i'm probably going to start thinking about what to make for dinner and crack open a beer.\n  ","395609":"\n  most likely not, especially if they're resistant to being educated on the topic. i wouldn't feel comfortable being around someone who essentially claims that my existence is invalid or false.\n  ","395610":"\n  again, it really depends on my mood -- certain things can make me lose my patience one day, while other days it's fine.\n  \n  people in general, though, make me lose my patience. intolerance, racism, homophobia\/transphobia, ableism, etc etc. i'm also really impatient when i drive, haha.\n  ","395611":"\n  depends on my mood, lmaoo. most days, i'd say around a 7 or 8. however, other days it's more of a 2 or 3.\n  ","395612":"\n  aw, this is super sweet. thank you so much ~~\n  ","395613":"\n  ugh, i totally agree -- i don't use tumblr anymore, but when i did, i would always see people using trans identities or sexual orientations or even mental illnesses as a trend, which is upsetting because people struggle so much with these things in real life.\n  \n  i don't see it much anymore (then again i stopped using tumblr like 2+ years ago). but there's definitely a small percentage of people who are faking it just for clout.\n  ","395614":"\n  no problem !!\n  \n  i apologize if i seemed a bit brash in certain responses, normally people attack me for my gender so i always think there's an underlying tone of contempt or discrimination in other people's messages.\n  ","395615":"\n  gender is something of exploration, and it's valid for some people to discover that they're cis after all. it isn't \"returning to their senses,\" it's a re-discovery of themselves and coming to terms with who they are.\n  \n  i've known i wasn't a girl\/woman since i was a teenager. i just wasn't educated on trans identities or the terminology until i became an adult.\n  ","395616":"\n  it isn't very important to me. i just have it in my bio so people know what my pronouns are.\n  ","395617":"\n  well, they're not feelings in terms of your personality. it's independent of your personality. it's how you view yourself, your body in some cases, etc etc.\n  \n  personally speaking, i experience dysphoria. because i don't identify as a woman, i dislike the fact that i have breasts and thighs & it makes me feel uncomfortable with myself because it doesn't fit my gender expression. if i could have top surgery (when i lose like 80 pounds), i would.\n  ","395618":"\n  it isn't a bullsh*t definition, it's the standard definition that corresponds with what non-binary means. you don't identify with the standard feelings of what a woman is, neither do you identify with the standard feelings of what a man is.\n  \n  it varies for each individual, as well. some people feel both binaries at varying degrees (i.e. genderfluid) and others don't feel a gender at all (i.e. agender). i used to think i was genderfluid until i came across the term non-binary & realized it suited me better.\n  ","395619":"\n  they were popular for a hot minute when \"all the things she said\" came out, although it was mainly out of controversy because of the girl-on-girl action.\n  \n  that was my introduction to them, and then i went deeper into their discography.\n  ","395620":"\n  i've always loved t.A.T.u., haha. their music was one of the first types of music i was interested in when i was a pre-teen.\n  ","395621":"\n  they may be inquisitive to a certain extent, but they're also being degrading and close minded in that they're not allowing themselves to be educated on gender identity.\n  \n  there's only so much questioning until it becomes circular questioning (like a previous anon pointed out). at that point, it's tiresome.\n  ","395622":"\n  gender identity is separate from gender expression. as shown in the chart and as i've stated earlier, non-binary is sorta the \"in between\" of the man and woman binaries.\n  \n  i'm not going to really get in-depth with this *again* because i've already explained this at least once in this thread.\n  ","395623":"\n  i already explained this, and i even offered a chart explaining this as well. there's only so much i can educate people on if they're not willing to open their minds to ideas that are foreign to them.\n  \n  i've given you plenty of answers, facts, & resources. it's ultimately up to you if you want to listen or not.\n  ","395624":"\n  non-binary is an identity in itself, as there are more options to gender than man and woman.\n  \n  sexual orientation is different from your gender identity -- your gender is who you are inside, while your orientation is who you're sexually and\/or romantically attracted to.\n  ","395625":"\n  i thought i've been explaining it quite well, but apparently not. it goes to show how little people are educated on trans identities, unfortunately.\n  \n  i found this chart that may be useful for them ;\n  ","395626":"\n  non-binary simply means that your gender is neither man nor woman (hence the prefix \"non\" referring to the binaries of gender). it's a gender identity in itself, but it can also be used an an umbrella term to also mean identities like genderfluid, agender, etc etc.\n  ","395627":"\n  as i've said multiple times, i'm non-binary.\n  ","395628":"\n  i don't remember the majority of my childhood up until the age of 11 or so. however, i remember watching a lot of cartoon network and toonami. i like dragonball z and thundercats.\n  ","395629":"\n  no, i don't -- the only online games i'll play are destiny 2 and any of the halo games, which aren't MMOs or anything. i usually dislike large multiplayer games.\n  ","395630":"\n  uh, this makes zero sense. like i said earlier, gender and sex are completely different. i'm not female with male characteristics, because that would insinuate that i have both male & female secondary sex characteristics. i'm not intersex.\n  \n  there's no problem with people being trans or non-binary. it's something personal to them and has no effect on anyone else's life. to claim it's unacceptable is transphobic, to say the least.\n  ","395631":"\n  my inbox is empty !!\n  \n  ask me

however, writing can also be a destructive process because you're literally purging yourself of your feelings and your energies in order to create that piece. it's like any art form of art, where you

assigned gender at birth. also, the idea of androgyny has nothing to do with gender either -- androgyny is a physical expression of oneself through things like hair, makeup, clothing, etc etc.\n  \n

I know it's silly but it just makes me uncomfortable for some reason. I would also feel the pressure to constantly be exciting and keep the person mesmerized in a marriage to avoid the spark dying out or being too boring like in everyday life. I have bpd (untreated atm) so I get crazily attached to people and since 50% of marriages end in divorce, I don't think it'd be able to handle starting all over because I don't do well with significant life changes. Do you have any advice? I don't wanna be stuck feeling like this for years and years. Thank you.\n  \n  --\n  \n  first off, i'm sorry it's taken me so long to get to this. i've been wanting to answer this on my laptop because it was in three parts, just for ease of access.\n  \n  i understand how you feel -- significant life changes frighten me to a certain degree as well, especially in terms of relationships. my breakup with my ex devastated me, and i'm still recovering from it even though it's been multiple months.\n  \n  you're 20 years old, so you're still incredibly young and will grow a lot throughout your 20s, whether you believe that or not. everything will eventually fall into place, and i find it's best to not have any expectations at all. when things should happen, they'll happen and i always just tried to roll with it and see where things go.\n  \n  the reason why half of marriages end in divorce these days isn't because of a lack of compatibility, but it's because people simply aren't putting up with their spouse's sh*t anymore. back in the day, people (especially women) endured ab*se from their partner, while today it's more accepted for those women to leave those relationships.\n  \n  if you're with the right person, that natural spark won't die out completely. you may become comfortable with each other, but you will both still have fun together, and you have to remember that your partner should also be your closest, best friend as well. if your chemistry is right, then you won't feel the pressure to keep that spark alive because it naturally will remain lit.\n  ","395728":"\n  AI technology honestly scares me, but augmented reality
