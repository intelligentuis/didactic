she's impulsive, full of life and love and underlying anger with trauma from earlier in her life. she's drinks and smokes, and has a \"f*ck-it-all\" attitude that propels her forward in life. she has issues with abandonment and goes to desperate lengths to feel wanted and needed. as a result of her trauma, she's learned not to trust in anyone and is convinced that no one truly cares about her.\n  \n  there have been theories that chloe has borderline personality disorder, which obviously resonates with me considering i struggle with the same diagnosis. she's obviously suffered from depression & s*icidal thoughts throughout her life as well.\n  ","395998":"\n  it's funny, because i'm not religious but i love any sort of literary quotes related to biblical themes or the devil. so with this

return the feelings.\n  \n  loving someone, on the other hand, may be heartbreaking if the person doesn't love you in return.\n  ","396000":"\n  i'd rather be given the chance to visit 50 different

greatly misunderstood.\n  ","396027":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, but i'm assuming it's because of the lack of resources available in order to treat everyone who shows symptoms and\/or are formally diagnosed with the coronavirus. there are too many people & not enough supplies or personnel.\n  ","396028":"\n  anger affects me the most -- i get angry pretty easily at things that might even be insignificant, and it's something i'm trying to continually work on, even though i'm not in therapy anymore.\n  \n  granted -- the reasons why i get angry are warranted, but my immediate response to

haven't watched any of the live streams, but i've always been curious about big cats, such as panthers or snow leopards or lions or tigers.\n  ","396433":"\n  my best friend a true warrior in every sense of the word. i admire her tenacity and ability to keep moving forward in her life and career despite the setbacks in her life, and she's endured so much hardship. she's one of the strongest people i know and i'm proud to call her my best friend.\n  ","396434":"\n  my anxiety has been at an all-time high, likely due to the fact that the coronavirus is so unpredictable and that i lack a sense of control over what's going on in my life. things are different day by day, and we're forced to take each day at a time because the next day is uncertain.\n  \n  i've been taking my regular xanax twice per day, but it hasn't been helping at all. i started taking some herbal anti-anxiety medications from the pharmacy, and they've been helping a little in conjunction with my xanax, but every day i've woken up with a beating in my chest and inability to breathe.\n  ","396435":"\n  i wish zoos would release their captive animals and release them to either compassionate sanctuaries with a lot of space for those animals to roam, or back into the wild. most zoos are in terrible condition and the animals are miserable.\n  ","396436":"\n  it's simple, but i've always loved hand-written letters. i like personalized things where people are expressing their emotions or gratitude.\n  ","396437":"\n  my camera roll mainly consists of cats at the moment, lmaoo. i seldom take selfies unless i'm tipsy\/drunk and feel confident in myself in that particular moment.\n  ","396438":"\n  -- serial killer documentaries.\n  \n  -- following crime scene clean-up accounts on social

mental illness in general, although i suppose that isn't very surprising. i know a lot about the symptoms about various mental disorders and treatment modalities.\n  ","396440":"\n  i've heard of the dante's inferno video game, but i never played it.\n  ","396441":"\n  i don't have a bucket list for 2020, haha. the year has been terrible thus far, and my only goal is to continue surviving the year.\n  ","396442":"\n  while i'm an advocate of mental health awareness, i seldom talk about the \"darker\" aspects of my illnesses unless i feel comfortable enough around someone to trust that they

in college, i enjoyed reading \"dante's inferno\" by dante alighieri. i also liked \"the canterbury tales\" by geoffrey chaucer.\n  ","396447":"\n  when i moved into a house with my two roommates, i inherited their two cats. lol.\n  ","396448":"\n  i don't generally ascribe to labels. however, if i had to label myself with anything in order for people to better know me, i would say that i'm mentally ill, non-binary, a writer, a gamer, a tattoo enthusiast, and a coffee addict.\n  ","396449":"\n  thanks? i am single, and i'm 28 years old.\n  ","396450":"\n  depends on the nature of the bad

","396451":"\n  no, i don't believe in love at first sight. i think that's actually lust because you're attracted to someone at first glance, whether it's their physical appearance or their general vibe that they give off. you don't know anything about this person, so you cannot realistically love them in the genuine sense of the word love.\n  ","396452":"\n  i think it's absolutely ridiculous,

out with my closest friends.\n  ","396455":"\n  tbh, i think that's just a stereotype that has persisted through the ages. there's only a small fraction of people who are solely motivated by greed when it comes to them choosing their partners.\n  ","396456":"\n  mental health advocacy and awareness. it has been something i've been deeply passionate about for quite a few years now, and i try my best to educate others who have questions regarding mental health or mental illness, drawing upon my own experiences beginning from when i was a teenager.\n  ","396457":"\n  tamriel -- from the elder

 my first job was when i was 19 years old, and i was hired as a cashier at a local drug store. eventually, i was promoted a few times to photo technician, photo lab supervisor, and pharmacy technician.\n  \n  i enjoyed developing photos a lot, and i liked the responsibilities of being supervisor of the photo lab. however, upper management was terrible and dealing with customers on a daily basis really frightened me.\n  ","396461":"\n  i purchased my first car when i was 19 years old, and it was a volkswagen cabrio. :')) i absolutely loved that car.\n  ","396462":"\n  yes, i went to two different colleges for my undergraduate studies. my first year was at a liberal arts college in massachusetts, and i majored in creative writing.\n  \n  after i returned to new york, i enrolled in a local college that i commuted to on a daily basis, and my major was communications and professional writing with a minor in english literature. i graduated with my bachelor's degree in 2013.\n

dating me, lmaoo. i'm not exactly an extraordinary individual, and i prefer solitude as opposed to being out with other people. i have no intentions of dating anytime soon.\n  ","396465":"\n  it would depend on their personalities and how intelligent they actually are -- formal schooling isn't necessarily an indication of how smart someone is, because they could just as easily have done independent studies and gone through life experiences that have taught them knowledge.\n  \n  money isn't a factor to me when it comes to choosing someone to date, especially if the options are \"rich\" or \"average.\" i would choose the person with whom i connect with emotionally.\n  ","396466":"\n  at this point, i'm just hoping this quarantine ends within the next few months so that i can enjoy going out to a restaurant or local bar\/restaurant and enjoy some food & happy hour drinks.\n  ","396467":"\n  you're definitely not the only one, and i'm sure plenty of people feel the same way as you do. depending on how severe your area has been impacted, you don't necessarily *have* to stay inside of your house 24\/7. you can go take a walk around the block or take a solitary drive just to get some fresh air.\n  ","396468":"\n  i've never dated online before, so i'm not quite sure how i would even go about doing it. however, i do believe it's important to remain vigilant about who you're talking to and make sure that you're always in a safe environment.\n  ","396469":"\n  i'm pretty good friends with some of my ex's ex-girlfriends, if that's considered \"weird\" at all.\n  ","396470":"\n  i

","396477":"\n  do you mean american idol? then no.\n  ","396478":"\n  not really, no.\n  \n  if you want a decent taste of the music i'm into, listen to grey daze (chester bennington's old band from the 1990s). i'm currently listening to them.\n  ","396479":"\n  you don't necessarily have to be elderly in order to pass away from the virus. there are been dozens of people in their 30s and 40s, etc etc., who have contracted the virus and passed away from it as well. there have been infants and babies who have died from the coronavirus. no one is immune.\n  ","396480":"\n  she's exactly right. like i stated earlier, you can be a carrier and display no symptoms, but you're just as much of a risk as anyone else to pass the virus onto someone else.\n  \n  that's why i haven't visited my parents' house lately (except today to bring the garbage cans in). my mother is immunocompromised, and for some reason she doesn't seem to understand that i can still carry the virus even if i don't show symptoms, and i don't want to subject her to it at all. i live with two people who are essential workers who go to work with the public every day. it's highly probable that they're bringing the virus home with them.\n  ","396481":"\n  yeah, i don't know anyone personally but i've seen posts on social media of people continuing to go to their friends' houses and hanging out, having \"quarantine parties,\" etc etc. it's completely irresponsible.\n  ","396482":"\n  a hoodie and jeans? lmaoo.\n  \n  i don't dress up unless it's for something significant, like a wedding or a funeral.\n  ","396483":"\n  yes, most definitely. isolation in times of a global pandemic such as this is integral because it reduces the spread of the virus. when people would normally be going out to bars, restaurants, stores, etc etc., they're now regulated and cannot go out as they please to interact with hundreds of people on a regular basis.\n  ","396484":"\n  honestly, i agree. it's difficult to develop a vaccine and then patent it, test it through clinical trials, etc etc. right now, the best way to reduce the number of deaths is through isolating people to their homes and treating the current positive patients as best as they possibly can.\n  ","396485":"\n  i honestly have no idea, tbh. it seems like the government is keeping us in the loop on a 30-day basis. we won't know how long we're supposed to stay inside until the end of another 30-day cycle.\n  ","396486":"\n  uh ... i'm not exactly sure what you're asking? obviously people want to be able to leave their homes freely, but that isn't advisable at the moment because many people can be asymptomatic carriers and spread the virus to at risk individuals.\n  ","396487":"\n  i certainly hope not, but it wouldn't surprise me if it does. numbers aren't decreasing in the united states, at the very least.\n  ","396488":"\n  LOL, no. that's more of a summer time beer.\n  ","396489":"\n  i'm watching the movie outbreak (1995). it's starring dustin hoffman and morgan freeman, and it's essentially about an epidemic that breaks out in california and the ways the CDC and hospitals react to the outbreak.\n

maybe a 6? it started off terribly, but it's currently ending on a good note. :'))\n  ","396493":"\n  i enjoy both, within reason. i love nature and being surrounded by the woods and trees and bodies of water -- however, i also like decompressing at home with some video games and sleeping.\n  ","396494":"\n  yes, i absolutely love the taste of mint. mint chocolate chip ice cream is among my favorite flavors. i also enjoy peppermint tea.\n  ","396495":"\n  i've never been to indonesia, and i don't have an opinion on people who are from indonesia.\n  ","396496":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  today started off terribly because i was experiencing some pretty bad anxiety attacks. however, it slowly got better and i ended up treating myself to some taco bell for dinner & now i'm drinking a few beers and watching netflix while browsing the internet on my laptop. i'm happy that i'm not feeling very anxious anymore.\n  ","396497":"\n  does anyone have any questions? my inbox is empty ~~\n  ","396498":"\n  i'm proud of myself for surviving my life thus far, and still holding onto the motivation to continue improving myself despite the hardships i've endured. i've struggled with mental illness since i was a pre-teen, and i only sought professional help when i was 25 years old. my entire life has changed since then, for the better. i genuinely think that if i didn't make that move to help myself at 25, i would have passed away.\n  ","396499":"\n  i see absolutely zero advantages or positive things about the global pandemic. there are some people who consider it a \"blessing\" to be with their families during this time, but to call it a blessing completely ignores the fact that there are a majority of people who are in inconvenient and often dangerous circumstances as a result of quarantine.\n  \n  people are stuck at home with ab*sive spouses. children are stuck at home with ab*sive parents. there's a significant population who are at risk and vulnerable to the coronavirus, which makes it difficult to see family if they need supplies. individuals are dying at an alarming rate, and there are still so many people who aren't practicing social distancing and that's making the situation even worse. to call the pandemic a \"blessing\" is ignorant.\n  ","396500":"\n  i believe they're all important in different ways, so it depends entirely on the individual as to what is the *most* important. for me personally, the most important thing at the moment is helping myself. i'm in a position where i need to heal from past traumas, past struggles, past failures, etc etc. in order for me to be the best version of yourself, i need to help myself to the fullest extent.\n  ","396501":"\n  i believe using the word \"addictive\" takes it a step too far, because addiction implies that someone has a physical dependence on something in that a person ends up going through withdrawals when they're without that substance.\n  \n  loneliness is dangerous to begin with, point blank. loneliness is a negative feeling, and i believe the word that's better for this particular question is \"solitude.\" you can be in solitude and not be lonely, and there's nothing wrong with that. a lot of people enjoy being in solitude.\n  ","396502":"\n  i don't believe it's better to hold grudges, no. holding a grudge only ends up hurting yourself in the end, because you're clenching onto negative feelings and auras regardless of how the other person feels.\n  \n  sometimes you don't forgive someone, but you also don't hold a grudge against that person. and that's perfectly okay.\n  ","396503":"\n  three values that i believe to be of the utmost importance are compassion, loyalty, and honesty.\n  \n  compassion -- because it's integral to cultivate meaningful relationships with others, and to have a sense of empathy in order to help those around you (as well as yourself).\n  \n  loyalty -- because it's important to be true to your word, as well as be true to yourself and others. if you cannot be loyal to your friends or partner, then you need to re-evaluate your meaning of relationships and how it can impact everyone involved.\n  \n  honesty -- because honesty is perhaps one of the most important facets of maintaining meaningful relationships with others, platonic or otherwise. you need to be honest with yourself and with other people in order to progress forward.\n  ","396504":"\n  the healthiest things that i enjoy doing are sleeping, venting to friends, and expressing myself via art (writing or painting).\n  ","396505":"\n  taco bell, by far. i actually felt like \"treating\" myself, so i ordered taco bell for dinner, lmaoo. i had a cheese quesadilla and a cheesy gordita crunch.\n  ","396506":"\n  honestly, sometimes i'll just eat a plate of vegetables for a meal, lmaoo. i love spinach, broccoli, asparagus, bell peppers, etc etc. i'll eat ceasar salads on occasion, but i don't really consider those to be \"healthy\" since there's usually cheese and dressing on them.\n  ","396507":"\n  linkin park, by far. they were the number one sole inspiration for me during my teenage years, and they gave me a reason for existing. i lived through their music more than anything else, and i felt connected emotionally to them for a variety of reasons. they've saved my life on numerous occasions.\n  ","396508":"\n  ????\n  ","396509":"\n  i'm tired of witnessing historical moments, lmaoo. between this pandemic, the 9\/11 attacks, the economy crashing, swine flu, the war in iraq, all of the mass shootings ... it's too much.\n  ","396510":"\n  taxidermy !!\n  ","396511":"\n  i met the members of linkin park back in like ... 2004, i think.\n  ","396512":"\n  no, i don't believe in horoscopes. they're written as a quick buck and can apply to mostly anyone because of how vague they are.\n  ","396513":"\n  LOL, yes -- extremely. it's amazing how so many people seem to lack common sense these days, smh.\n  ","396514":"\n  my day has been fine, other than the horrible anxiety attacks i had earlier this morning.\n  \n  i went to get taco bell with my roommate, so now i'm quite content. i'm planning on relaxing, drinking copious amounts of beer, and watching television.\n  ","396515":"\n  wild animals are supposed to be out in the wild -- not held in people's homes (unless they're ill and cannot survive outside of captivity). even in that case, sanctuaries are the best option.\n  ","396516":"\n  i finished watching it earlier this week & it was absolutely wild. each episode was more ridiculous than the last, and overall i found it very fascinating.\n  \n  i also like how people who have watched it are now educated on the harmful effects of keeping animals in captivity like that. there are more tigers in captivity than there are in the wild, and that's sad.\n  ","396517":"\n  cheetos, omg.\n  ","396518":"\n  no, we've only lived at this house since october when bugs aren't really out, so we haven't come across anything.\n  ","396519":"\n  because he was asking a question about the program i administrate, but the question he asked insinuated that i didn't do my job properly and he was just \"checking to make sure it was correct.\"\n  ","396520":"\n  i got angry at my coworker yesterday because they were basically questioning my competence at my job in a very off-hand, passive aggressive way.\n  \n  i'm over it now, but it really angered me yesterday to the point where it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest.\n  ","396521":"\n  i don't remember the majority of my childhood, but i believe it was reading and writing.\n  ","396522":"\n  the best vacations i've been on have been any of the times i've traveled to upstate new york with my friends. they're only weekend trips, but i have such fond memories.\n  ","396523":"\n  i'm friends with two out of three of my exes, so yes i believe it's possible.\n  ","396524":"\n  my ex, haha. we're still close friends and i've always been able to talk to him about anything.\n  ","396525":"\n  i'm not really religious or spiritual, but i do believe that humans are composed of energy in the form of our souls & these energies cannot be destroyed. when our physical bodies perish, i believe that those energies get transferred to another medium.\n  ","396526":"\n  i prefer bruno mars over drake.\n  ","396527":"\n  i actually

switch, and i don't want to spend money to buy one solely to play one game, lol. i already have an xbox one that i use a lot.\n  ","396531":"\n  no, i don't play animal crossing.\n  ","396532":"\n  yeah, we're advised to stay in quarantine for the foreseeable future. only going out to places when necessary and every essential store closes at 8:00pm.\n  \n  new york is one of the places that has been hit the hardest, so cuomo has been giving daily briefings.\n  ","396533":"\n  i don't personally know any gossip about myself. and i don't remember if there was ever gossip about me when i was in middle or high school.\n  ","396534":"\n  no, i don't usually eat candy at all.\n  ","396535":"\n  i suppose that has something to do with it, yeah. i went to 7-11 yesterday which was good for me to leave the house and get some fresh air.\n  ","396536":"\n  LOL. some people think it's a gendered phrase while others don't. and who knows, the person insisting that there's only men and women could very well be a man.\n  \n  i don't exactly think a meme should be criticized so in depth, though lol. it's just a meme.\n  ","396537":"\n  i'm not doing so well today. i started crying at my desk earlier because my anxiety is so horrible this morning, even though i took my medication and a few herbal pills that are supposed to help with anxiety.\n  \n  everything is becoming too much & it's overwhelming.\n  ","396538":"\n  i wouldn't know, i've been coloring my hair since i was a teenager.\n  ","396539":"\n  haha, definitely not. i'm terrified to even give myself a haircut.\n

","396542":"\n  my mental health\/illnesses. a lot of people don't think i'm neuroatypical because i don't \"give off the impression\" that i'm mentally ill, since i'm good at expressing myself via writing. these people seem to think that mental stability and the ability to write well are correlated, which is far from the truth, lol.\n  ","396543":"\n  eh, it depends on what the person did to screw up the first chance they were given.\n  ","396544":"\n  i kept a journal when i was a pre-teen. however, my parents entered my room and read the entire journal when i was at school one day, so i never wrote in one after that because i couldn't trust my family anymore.\n  ","396545":"\n  tbh, i'm terrible at calming myself down and looking at things from a different perspective, especially these days. however, some good tips i've tried and they worked sometimes are ;\n  \n  -- document your feelings in a journal.\n  \n  -- take a relaxing, solitary walk outside (if it's safe to do so).\n  \n  -- do a hobby you enjoy, personally i like video games, writing, and art.\n  \n  -- vent to a friend about your worries\/concerns.\n  \n  -- watch relaxing videos or listen to tranquil music on youtube.\n  ","396546":"\n  i had a productive day !! tonight is dedicated to relaxation. :'))\n  \n  i worked my normal hours, ordered some chicken fingers for lunch, and then after work i

that the coronavirus (well, COVID-19 specifically) is simply a mutated, stronger version of the coronavirus that no one was able to predict because we had not yet come across that strain before.

(i.e. the law), but in most cases people will do what they want according to their own moral system.\n  \n  i believe that if an activity hurts a person who does not deserve to be hurt, then it's a bad activity (including if it hurts yourself). right actions, on the other hand, are indifferent actions or actions that benefit people.\n  ","396629":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n

up to your mistakes instead of deflecting blame or ignoring the mistake entirely.\n  ","396637":"\n  i don't have a preference. i normally just do what it is i need and want to do without concerning myself with what other people are doing.\n  ","396638":"\n  my best skill is my talent in writing. i utilize it everyday at work, for which i'm quite thankful.\n  \n  tbh, i have no interest in

thing is happening to one of my roommates. his hours got reduced because of less available work, and he's been coming home around 1-2pm instead of 4pm like usual.\n  \n  i know *a lot* of people out of work. prior to establishing us working from home, my job furloughed 10 people from my department alone. i also have friends whose jobs have closed and they're on unemployment.\n  ","396640":"\n  that's what happens when people get older. their thoughts & opinions evolve.\n  ","396641":"\n  my favorite book is \"girl interrupted\" by susanna kaysen. i read it when i was a teenager and fell in

for yourself as well.\n  ","396643":"\n  no, it isn't important to me. i have a strained relationship with my parents so their opinion doesn't hold any water when it comes to my personal life.\n

same amount of work, tbh. it might be a bit less because working remotely from my laptop into my desktop slows my computer a bit (which is normal, apparently it's the same for everyone else). but overall, i'm getting the same amount of work done.\n  \n  the day actually goes by a bit faster because i've been able to focus more with less distraction, haha.\n  ","396747":"\n  yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous. health care facilities, like hospitals and clinics and now even the javits center, are pleading with the government for more ventilators, and trump has the audacity to say \"nah, i don't think you need them\" or \"no, your nurses are hoarding all of the masks.\" it's absolutely infuriating.\n  \n  nurses and doctors are wearing the same masks for several 12-13 hour shifts in a row, multiple days in a row. i read somewhere that even patients are sharing ventilators because ventilators have become so sparse. it's ridiculous.\n  ","396748":"\n  hey friends ~~\n  \n

of god.\"\n  \n  i simply think that the coronavirus broke out and spread much like any other virus, except this is one we've never seen before. it's difficult, if not impossible, to treat and\/or cure a virus that we've never come across, especially one of this magnitude that has spread across most countries at an alarming rate. it's science, more than anything else.\n  ","396779":"\n  i've never really thought of any challenges, so no. honestly, i think everyone is extremely stressed out at this time & instead of making challenges for ourselves, we should be more focused on doing things that keep us on a routine, that keep us stable, that keep us occupied, and that keep us relaxed.\n  ","396780":"\n  i don't really believe that you can make a determination of how much or little

he said that governors weren't appreciative enough of him, or something along those lines, and didn't think more ventilators were necessary in certain hospitals. even though they're desperately needed.\n  \n  he's been raving about viewership on his most recent press conference, but doesn't realize that the reason it was watched is because citizens are terrified, confused, and left in the dark about what's happening.\n  ","396789":"\n  i've always washed my hands routinely, but i did start washing them more often and using hand sanitizer, especially when i worked in the office building.\n  ","396790":"\n  no, i didn't wear a mask. i don't own one.\n  ","396791":"\n  i'm not sure, tbh. i don't know the science or economic aspects of it.\n  ","396792":"\n  yeah, it's absolutely terrible to hear alongside the patients who have been suffering from the coronavirus as well. in most countries (especially the united states), hospitals and other facilities simply do not have the adequate equipment necessary to treat everyone, as well as protect themselves. doctors and nurses are forced to wear the same mask for days at a time because there has been such a shortage.\n  ","396793":"\n  -- deconstruct tasks into multiple smaller steps. it's much easier to tackle a difficult task when you've broken it up into progressive parts that you can check off as you go along.\n

","396801":"\n  my ribcage tattoo hurt the most.\n  ","396802":"\n  yeah, that happened a lot during the transition of being a teenager into being an adult. it happens -- it's relatively normal and common.\n  ","396803":"\n  drug addiction is a health care issue, not a criminal issue. part of the reason why there's so much recidivism is because the addict still obtains the drugs in prison, which only aggravates the addiction more. instead of giving them a tougher prison sentence, addicts should have the opportunity to be enrolled in comprehensive rehabilitation programs that they can actually afford.\n  ","396804":"\n  seeing my friends & my coworkers.\n  ","396805":"\n  ... that's not in the nude. that's wearing a robe, lol.\n  ","396806":"\n  i don't walk around the house in the nude,

number of people there, surprisingly.\n  ","396814":"\n  i'm sorta like an \"extroverted introvert\" in that while i need alone time to recharge and feel refreshed, i'm also outgoing around very small groups of friends.\n  ","396815":"\n  being alone is one of the only ways i can actually recharge, because being around people drains me so much. i usually just browse social media and listen to music. sleeping also helps a lot.\n  ","396816":"\n  i made eggs this morning & for lunch i wasn't terribly hungry, so i just toasted an english muffin and put butter on it.\n  \n  my roommate feels like making cheeseburgers, so we'll probably have that for dinner.\n  ","396817":"\n  definitely not, haha. i've been friends with them for 10 years and i've never been interested in either of them like that.\n  ","396818":"\n  i'm going to put it towards bills & groceries.\n  ","396819":"\n  i'm comfortable at the moment. i have the window slightly open, but i'm wearing sweatpants and a hoodie.\n  ","396820":"\n  i've never used a dating app before.\n  ","396821":"\n  obviously black people can use the word as they please since it's their word to reclaim. the n word has been used to oppress black people for decades.\n  ","396822":"\n  i agree with this as well. our attitudes mean everything when it comes to dealing with difficult tasks or situations, and if we enter into a situation with a positive or productive attitude, then the outcome may be more in our favor.\n  ","396823":"\n  i agree, most definitely. it's important to remain committed to your goals, because you're going to hit road bumps along the way regardless and you shouldn't allow them to deter you from what you want to do.\n  ","396824":"\n  i swear all the time, even when i'm not frustrated.\n  ","396825":"\n  i wanted to discuss with people and show people that mental health is important, in light of my own experiences with mental illness and witnessing my friends struggle with mental illness as well.\n  \n  i don't really remember if i had a particular perspective prior to my early 20s. i didn't understand mental illness because it was never discussed with me despite struggling with it since my early teenage years.\n  ","396826":"\n  i honestly don't remember. probably last summer.\n  ","396827":"\n  i'm frustrated but relieved at the same time, haha. i just spent nearly two hours trying to contact my psychiatrist -- the office is closed to patients, so the office has been scheduling video chat and telephone appointments. the video chat wasn't working on my doctor's end so i ended up just sitting at my laptop and waiting for over an hour until she finally just called my cell phone, and we talked that way.\n  \n  now i just have to wait until my medication is ready for pickup, and i'll have to leave the house to go to the pharmacy either tonight or tomorrow.\n  ","396828":"\n  ever since my early 20s, i believe. i didn't properly seek mental health treatment for myself until i was 25 years old, though.\n  ","396829":"\n  i live in new york, which is now considered the \"epicenter\" of the coronavirus at the moment because of the high volume of cases and deaths. there are over 8,000 cases on long island alone, not counting the boroughs or upstate new york.\n  \n  things are going as \"well\" as they can be, i suppose. people have been instructed to stay inside unless it's for essential travel.\n  ","396830":"\n  yeah, the coronavirus is definitely making people emotional for a variety of reasons. your emotions are completely valid.\n  ","396831":"\n  i don't really have high standards when it comes to movies, haha. however, when napoleon dynamite first came out while i was in high school (i think), everyone was obsessed with it. i watched it and thought it was terrible, though.\n  ","396832":"\n  that is part of the issue, yes. a lot of people diminish the significance of mental health and mental illness because it's an \"invisible illness,\" and there are also some people who believe that mental illness is something one can control or get over, which can't be further from the truth.\n  ","396833":"\n  it varies depending on the relationship -- some people want to move in together after a few months, other people wait a few years. it's whatever feels most natural to the specific relationship.\n  ","396834":"\n  not really, but if provided the opportunity, i don't believe i would say no.\n  ","396835":"\n  not really, no. i always go to stop & shop because it's the closest supermarket to me.\n  ","396836":"\n  yes, i actually took the 23andme ancestry test a few years ago !! the results were definitely interesting.\n  ","396837":"\n  no, my roommates and i rarely have the opportunity to do so.\n  ","396838":"\n  depends on the situation because it's both yes and no.\n  ","396839":"\n  i cannot stand arrogance and\/or close-mindedness the most. it's frustrating when people cannot think outside of their own bubble and automatically assume everything contrary to their own opinion is wrong.\n  ","396840":"\n  either \"minutes to midnight\" or \"hybrid theory\" from linkin park.\n  ","396841":"\n  i'm doing fine. i'm currently waiting for my tele-appointment with my psychiatrist, haha. they closed the office to patients so every appointment is done over the phone or via webcam\/facetime.\n  ","396842":"\n  yeah, there's an italian food market that i go to sometimes.\n  ","396843":"\n  i'm a writer and editor for a publishing company.\n  ","396844":"\n  i'm working from home.\n  ","396845":"\n  i'm watching the show \"tiger king\" on netflix & this sh*t is wild.\n  ","396846":"\n  that's definitely not true at all -- there are myriad individuals who have died from the coronavirus who aren't elderly.\n  \n  no one is immune. recently, an infant in new york passed away from the coronavirus.\n  ","396847":"\n  look at everything trump has been saying about the coronavirus -- he's been downplaying the virus completely & making statements that go against everything medical professionals are saying. a lot of people are wondering if it's because he doesn't want this pandemic to affect his possible re-election.\n  ","396848":"\n  no, lol. i don't believe there's any political cause behind the coronavirus. however, the reaction to the virus from various governments *is* politically-driven, and that's what is concerning.\n  ","396849":"\n  like a cure or vaccine? i believe so, yes.\n  ","396850":"\n  i'll think about that if it ever becomes an issue. for now, it's merely fiction to me.\n  ","396851":"\n  it's terrible, obviously. i'm hoping that everyone is staying inside their homes and doing their part to halt the progression of the virus.\n  ","396852":"\n  i don't believe in any religious\/spiritial god or higher being.\n  ","396853":"\n  WHY ARE WE YELLING.\n  ","396854":"\n  because my ex and i broke up a few months ago.\n

bible is simply a fictional story book.\n  ","396858":"\n  new york.\n  ","396859":"\n  i read the bible when i was much, much younger.\n  ","396860":"\n  there's no scientific proof of the existence of any god, and i'm of the understanding that most people only believe in god because they have faith. i don't have that faith, and i never did.\n  ","396861":"\n  obviously because i don't believe in god.\n  ","396862":"\n  yes, i'm an athiest.\n  ","396863":"\n  oh my god. why would you say those words. now that annoying christmas alvin & the chipmunks song is stuck in head.\n  ","396864":"\n  sometimes i wish i had disney+ or something so i could watch then older disney movies, haha.\n  ","396865":"\n  it makes me irrationally angry. lmao.\n  ","396866":"\n  i don't think i've ever personally come across any weird scams. i've only ever dealt with the ones where the elderly and others get a phone call where they're told their family member is in trouble & they have to wire transfer a ridiculous amount of money to the scammer.\n  ","396867":"\n  probably a coffee shop -- it's ideal because obviously there's coffee, and its a good environment to sit down and get to know someone.\n  ","396868":"\n  that stupid \"dance monkey\" song that's all over the radio.\n  ","396869":"\n  i have no clue, haha. i have a smart tv, so i'm guessing that maybe it is 4k? i use it to watch netflix and hulu.\n  ","396870":"\n  no, exercising isn't a requirement or anything to be a regular human being, lol. i'm sure some people choose not to exercise because of laziness but that isn't always the case.\n  ","396871":"\n  tbh, i agree with you -- cheating is a conscious decision, and if he genuinely does love and care for you, then he would have stopped himself and thought about how this would affect you.\n  ","396872":"\n  not necessarily. feelings change over time, and just because someone has cheated doesn't necessarily mean they *never* loved you. however, the fact that they did cheat obviously does indicate that they don't care about seeing you get hurt.\n  ","396873":"\n  i never said it was every day, lol. that's your preference, though. not everyone feels the same way you do.\n  ","396874":"\n  how is it inappropriate? we're still friends.\n  ","396875":"\n  neither, i've been trying more than anything else to focus on the present moment.\n  ","396876":"\n  i try not to have any regrets because it's useless to worry about something that's not in your control anymore.\n  ","396877":"\n  atlantis: the lost empire or treasure planet.\n

least with my phone, i can still talk to my friends, browse the internet, etc etc.\n  ","396882":"\n  yes, my friends consider me very loyal and trustworthy because i always keep their secrets to myself.\n  ","396883":"\n  you're anonymous, you're a stranger, and i'm not interested in dating.\n  ","396884":"\n  i'm enjoying the quiet. i'm not bored at all, because i've been working from home monday through friday and then i've been watching television and playing video games in my spare time.\n  ","396885":"\n  i don't have children, no. i'm not sure if i even want children in the future.\n  ","396886":"\n  mcdonalds, i can't stand KFC. even so, i usually only order mcdonalds french fries & their coffee is good too.\n  ","396887":"\n  yeah, i'm single.\n  ","396888":"\n  i don't really like sports, but i went to an ice hockey game once.\n  ","396889":"\n  i'm always down for questions & likes.\n  ","396890":"\n  i've never tried it before.\n  ","396891":"\n  i worked in retail at a drug store for 4 years of my life, which was absolute hell.\n  ","396892":"\n  LMAOOO. when you sent the first question, i was like \"...what.\" ?\n  \n  yes, my roommates and i have been cooking home more often than not.\n  ","396893":"\n  there have been people advocating for hotels in new york city to allow homeless individuals to use their rooms during the pandemic, not sure if anything has come to it though.\n  ","396894":"\n  never heard of it or had it before.\n  ","396895":"\n  i've already been through significant hardship & trauma, so what's one more year to add onto the baggage?\n  ","396896":"\n  i don't know what that is.\n  ","396897":"\n  it's definitely not *just* the flu, especially considering how fast it's been spreading over the past month alone and how lethal it has been to people of all ages. then coronavirus is a serious matter & it infuriates me when people aren't taking precautions seriously. they're drawing their own conclusions based on what they personally see, instead of listening to health care professionals.\n  \n  if you don't know anyone who has tested positive, it's most likely because the test is difficult to come by and they simply haven't had the privilege to be tested yet.\n  ","396898":"\n  definitely not, lol. i don't have the tolerance for incredibly spicy food.\n  ","396899":"\n  no, but his response to the coronavirus has been absolutely disgusting and inappropriate.\n  ","396900":"\n  no, not at the moment -- especially considering the virus is supposed to peak in the next two weeks in new york. it's safer for everyone to simply stay home.\n  ","396901":"\n  ugh, you're absolutely right. she's manipulated and gaslighted me for my entire life, and guaranteed if i brought up the word \"ab*se\" she would turn it around against me and claim that i'm trying to ruin her reputation, or something wild like that.\n  ","396902":"\n  i'm sorry in that case, lol. i know first hand how difficult it is dealing with a parent like this.\n  \n  my old therapist questioned if i ever wanted to confront my mother about everything in my past, and tbh idk i even want to at this point. i'm finally living on my own & i just want to heal and move on.\n  ","396903":"\n  tbh, i don't mind it at all. i'm fortunate in that i'm still working monday through friday but at home, so it's something to take my mind off of things and keep me occupied during most of the day.\n  ","396904":"\n  she definitely doesn't, which is so bizarre to me because it was both physical & verbal. she always berates me these days and tells me \"i don't know how you turned out this way!\" regarding my mental health issues. she doesn't realize that my upbringing between both her and my father is the cause of all of my problems.\n  ","396905":"\n  i haven't been outside the house besides to sit on my stoop in 10 days, lmaoo. i'm not really sure how things are outside, but according to my roommates, the roads are much emptier than usual. i'm not really sure of the police presence, but i do hear sirens often throughout the day.\n  ","396906":"\n  i'm unsure of the term \"love\" because you cannot unconditionally love someone & then ab*se them for over 15 years of their life. she's always seemed to have an ulterior motive, though, and she always tried to make me feel guilty about saying no or prioritizing myself.\n  ","396907":"\n  i'm not planning on leaving my house unless it's to go grocery shopping or pick up my medication at the pharmacy.\n  ","396908":"\n  yeah, he works in new york city so ... i guess he's as safe as he can reasonably be. from my understanding, he still has to work through all of this.\n  ","396909":"\n  we talk on the phone every few days as it is. i really do think she just wanted me to bring breakfast over, show my face, and do her laundry though despite the chaos going on in the world. i'm not going to risk my own health & her health just because she's denying that the coronavirus is a huge deal.\n  ","396910":"\n  i haven't visited in about a month ever since the whole quarantine thing started.\n  ","396911":"\n  she could have done that herself, yeah. the issue was that she wanted to see me, even though everyone is urging others to stay in their own houses and practice social distancing. she's also immunocompromised, but apparently isn't even concerned for her own health.\n  ","396912":"\n  no, she's disabled but she wasn't born with a disability.\n  ","396913":"\n  i don't discuss my sex life on the internet.\n  ","396914":"\n  i normally say \"what's up\" or \"how are you.\"\n  ","396915":"\n  i'm assuming it means \"what's good.\"\n  ","396916":"\n  yeah, everyone can order food depending on the restaurant. they're only offering takeout and delivery at this time.\n  ","396917":"\n  i have a headache & i'm hungry, but i have zero motivation to leave my bed.\n  ","396918":"\n  i haven't left the house in 10 days.\n  ","396919":"\n  this one sorta weirds me out too, tbh. i'm not sure how i feel about it because even though they're pretending to be non-consenting, they actually are performing consensual activity. at the same time, though, it's probably common among people who have experienced assault and are the kink as a coping mechanism.\n  ","396920":"\n  studio ghibli gardens & illustrations overall are beautiful.\n  ","396921":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree. i'm usually incredibly accepting and understanding of most kinks as long as they're between two consenting adults, but DDLG is definitely not one of them.\n  ","396922":"\n  yeah, it seems like more of a very unhealthy coping mechanism in light of their age regression & trauma than anything else. it has no place in the bedroom.\n  ","396923":"\n  DDLG is honestly the one \"kink\" that i cannot support. it isn't healthy for someone to pretend to be a child in a s*xual relationship, and then for their partner to pretend to be grooming a child like that. it's always seemed incredibly wrong to me.\n  ","396924":"\n  it's been fine. i just woke up from what i think was a three hour nap.\n  ","396925":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 28 years old.\n  ","396926":"\n  it wouldn't surprise me if i was, considering both of my roommates work with the public on a daily basis.\n  ","396927":"\n  no, they cannot afford that.\n  ","396928":"\n  i'm not sure if this is sarcasm or not. there are over 8,000 cases on long island alone, and that isn't counting the five boroughs or upstate new york.\n  ","396929":"\n  she's pretty much bed-bound so unfortunately i will have to go over there & do some chores for her eventually since my father is out of state for the next two weeks (extremely long story, he's safe and it's for a valid reason).\n  \n  but i honestly don't think she understands the gravity of the situation. nobody is really supposed to leave their homes to see other people except those they already live with. i'm not sure if she even watches the news or not.\n  ","396930":"\n  i don't usually talk about my family, but i'm legit so livid rn because of my mother's carelessness about the coronavirus.\n  \n  she texted me earlier this morning & asked me to pick up egg sandwiches for breakfast and go over her house to do a load of her laundry. i responded & told her that we cannot leave the house unless it's absolutely necessary, and after about 10 minutes, she sent me a huge paragraph about \"you haven't left your house & i haven't left mine so it's fine ... thanks anyway\" (to shorten it a lot).\n  \n  like... it's like she doesn't understand we're all in quarantine. not only can i be an asymptomatic carrier because both of my roommates interact with the public on a daily basis, but she's also immuno-compromised and in her 60s. realistically she should be concerned for her health, but instead she gets angry with me for following what the CDC and governor says to do. it's unbelievable.\n  ","396931":"\n  i love going down to the bay and having a drink and listening to live music. i also like eating at restaurants at their outdoor tables, and having nighttime campfires with my friends.\n  ","396932":"\n  oh jeez, LOL.\n  ","396933":"\n  you can probably discuss your feelings with her and explain that you feel uneasy because they'll be drunk, and see where it goes from there.\n  ","396934":"\n  if you have a legitimate reason to not attend, then they shouldn't hold that against you. however, if you're saying that you just simply don't want to go, then yeah that's a bad impression.\n  ","396935":"\n  i'm actually an extroverted introvert, meaning that while i am introverted by nature (being around large groups of people tires me out and i need solitude to recharge), i'm also extroverted around close friends and very small gatherings.\n  ","396936":"\n  this is currently my workplace, haha.\n  ","396937":"\n  i'm fine with both !! i like answering questions about my own experiences with the coronavirus pandemic, as well as other questions that relate to something else entirely.\n  ","396938":"\n  i don't mind the conversation about the coronavirus at all, tbh. i find it to be interesting, and i'm happy that people are discussing it and emphasizing staying inside & quarantining, because that's the safest thing to do rn.\n  ","396939":"\n  just cheese. sometimes i'll order pepperoni though.\n  ","396940":"\n  yes, restaurants are considered essential businesses, but we cannot dine-in anymore -- the only option they provide is delivery.\n  \n  i've been cooking at home for the past week or so, but last night we ordered a pizza.\n  ","396941":"\n  depends on how he words it and how he behaves, tbh. he isn't the type of person to \"beg\" or anything so this is fairly unrealistic to begin with anyway.\n  ","396942":"\n  if i wouldn't share them with anyone, then why would i share them on askfm where everyone can read them?\n  ","396943":"\n  yeah, i do. i also miss my friends and coworkers.\n  ","396944":"\n  i haven't bought an actual, material item that wasn't food in probably over a month, lmaoo.\n  ","396945":"\n  i automatically think of pewdiepie, ugh.\n  ","396946":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 28 years old.\n  ","396947":"\n  for the most part, yeah. it takes a lot for me to feel comfortable enough around someone to actually trust them.\n  ","396948":"\n  we all cook when necessary.\n  ","396949":"\n  i don't give that out because i'm only friends with people i actually know.\n  ","396950":"\n  i like it a lot, mostly because a few of my coworkers have become great friends of mine though.\n  ","396951":"\n  i'm a writer and editor for a publishing company.\n  ","396952":"\n  no, i spend most of my time working since i'm working from home at the moment.\n  ","396953":"\n  new vegas is my second favorite fallout game, with fallout 4 being my favorite. fallout 3 is the third of them, but i also never played 1 and 2.\n  ","396954":"\n  i've been playing fallout: new vegas lately, but i also enjoy skyrim, fallout 4, destiny 2, the assassin's creed series, bioshock, GTA V, and other fun games i play sometimes with my friends.\n  ","396955":"\n  my bedroom. where i can be alone and play video games and browse the internet on my laptop without interruption.\n  ","396956":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","396957":"\n  chester bennington, chris cornell, and scott weiland.\n  ","396958":"\n  this is weird.\n  ","396959":"\n  thanks for the confirmation. lmao.\n  ","396960":"\n  i'm not sure if i'm just drunk or this message makes absolutely no sense.\n  ","396961":"\n  i just said it was pink, yeah lol. he made it with tropical punch & a lottttttt of tito's vodka.\n  ","396962":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","396963":"\n  so my roommate just came in and handed me a glass of pink liquid, and said it was \"unicorn juice.\" there's clearly alcohol in here, so uh ... i guess i'm getting f*cked up tonight? ?\n  ","396964":"\n  i don't play games like this.\n  ","396965":"\n  no, we haven't done anything romantic or sexual since the breakup. we're strictly friends.\n  ","396966":"\n  honestly, i never thought i would live to see this age to begin with, so i never really set many expectations for myself when i was younger. i only knew that i wanted to spend my life writing and expressing myself through writing and art, which i suppose i've successfully done so far.\n  ","396967":"\n  artistic, eccentric, and socially awkward. lmao.\n  ","396968":"\n  i talked on the phone to a client the other day, and i didn't have a panic attack !! it was a 20 minute long conversation, and initially he was a bit agitated but i managed to talk him down. he seemed satisfied by the end of the conversation.\n  ","396969":"\n  i generally receive hate messages in reference to my gender and my opinions. depending on how unruly the anon is, i either delete their message (especially if it isn't even a question) or elaborate\/educate as best as i can.\n  ","396970":"\n  there are better alternatives in clothing than wearing the fur or skin of a dead animal. you can easily get faux fur or faux leather.\n  ","396971":"\n  well considering we're not together, no lol. if we date again in the future and things are better though, i would consider it.\n  ","396972":"\n  we talk most days out of the week.\n  ","396973":"\n  nope, i've been wearing glasses since i was a toddler.\n  ","396974":"\n  i'm not relieved at all. i'm very much heartbroken still, but i'm also grateful that we're still close friends because we have terrific chemistry together and our friendship itself is very strong.\n  ","396975":"\n  yes, love is most definitely real.\n  ","396976":"\n  i find that a bit weird at first glance, but they're both legal and consenting adults, so it isn't exactly my position to judge.\n  ","396977":"\n  my own experiences with mental health, love, relationships, etc etc.\n  ","396978":"\n  chronic illness, particularly \"invisible illnesses\" like mental illness and other physical illnesses that aren't apparent at first glance.\n  ","396979":"\n  uh, yeah? rofl. it's such a nice feeling to get out of pajamas, take a steaming hot shower, and then change into other pajamas.\n  ","396980":"\n  i take anti-anxiety medication twice a day.\n  ","396981":"\n  i'm not a fan of chocolate, or most sweets for that matter.\n  ","396982":"\n  no, i only had a brief stint as a rebellious person when i was 19 to around 22\/23 years old.\n  ","396983":"\n  uh, a 3 at most. lmao.\n  ","396984":"\n  absolutely. i haven't worn jeans in over 10 days.\n  ","396985":"\n  i haven't left my house since march 17th besides to go to the dunkin drive thru once for breakfast last week.\n  ","396986":"\n  i usually just get a cheese pie & occasionally i'll get pepperoni. i also like grandma slices with vodka sauce.\n  \n  as for beer, i'm a big fan of IPAs (how hipster of me) but i'm currently drinking a miller lite.\n  ","396987":"\n  i'm definitely not taking a video of me shotgunning a beer. definitely isn't that kind of night. lmaoo.\n  ","396988":"\n  it's pizza & beer night.\n  \n  ask me questions, muthaf*ckas.\n  ","396989":"\n  currently sitting down, scrolling through social media, and debating on whether or not to play video games.\n  ","396990":"\n  i'm pretty vocal with my feelings, so i can't think of anything significant.\n  ","396991":"\n  waking up in a cabin amid the mountains and woods, going out to the porch with a steaming hot cup of coffee, watching the snow or rain fall while i drink my coffee, and then spend quality time with friends and\/or a partner for the remainder of the day. we'd wander the forest, BBQ outside, have drinks together, sit outside of a campfire, and tell war stories until early morning hours.\n  ","396992":"\n  i'd magically be \"cured\" of my mental illnesses.\n  ","396993":"\n  not really, no. we've all been talking about getting new furniture and a television for the living room, but we're all very low on cash right now, so it isn't plausible (nor the most important thing to do anyway).\n  ","396994":"\n  my coworker's husband was tested two weeks ago & he *just* got the results back today. they were positive.\n  \n  since two weeks have passed, he's officially recovered, but that also probably means that my coworker herself had it too because after he got sick, she started feeling the same way. i'm so grateful that they're both fine now, it could have been so much worse for them.\n  ","396995":"\n  i've never tried it before.\n  ","396996":"\n  i get judged most online for my gender, and political and social beliefs.\n  \n  i'm not sure if i'm judged IRL or not based on the above, because the only people i interact with are friends and coworkers.\n  ","396997":"\n  about one month ago, i didn't see the coronavirus as a big deal -- however, that opinion quickly changed when i saw how fast it was spreading, how many people have passed away, and how exhausted hospitals and doctors are in light of this pandemic. it's a complete catastrophe.\n  ","396998":"\n  nothing in particular, but i would be disheartened that i would live forever. that seems like an awful existence.\n  ","396999":"\n  i'm incredibly anxious and there's absolutely nothing i can do about it rn. :\/\n  ","397000":"\n  some of the anon questions i receive here.\n  ","397001":"\n  why would i be happy about that? lol. i also don't even live in the UK.\n  ","397002":"\n  there are plenty of gyms offering free workout streams and classes on facebook & youtube that you can do at home (i know planet fitness and orange theory are two of them).\n  ","397003":"\n  i wouldn't necessarily say that i miss it really, because it's more of a luxury than anything else, but it would be nice to dine-in at applebees or a local taco joint and have some appetizers and happy hour drinks.\n  ","397004":"\n  tik tok dances.\n  ","397005":"\n  yes, i'm single.\n  ","397006":"\n  tbh, in the latter example, i still consider that to be unfaithful and i don't believe i would be apt to give them a \"pass.\" i'm at a point in my life where i require a person to be wholly committed to me.\n  ","397007":"\n  i already discussed this. i probably would break up with them, and it depends whether or not i would forgive them in the future.\n  ","397008":"\n  that's still cheating in my opinion.\n  ","397009":"\n  depends on what they're saying & if they're making promises to one another. if my partner was saying that they loved the other person and was promising to meet them and whatnot, then i would simply break up with them because that's considered cheating in my eyes.\n  \n  forgiveness is another story. i'd probably forgive them over time, but that doesn't make the behavior okay.\n  "}}
