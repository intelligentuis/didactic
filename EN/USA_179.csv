   My friend keeps texting and giving short responses and one word texts. I’m really annoyed by it, should I reply back or just end the conversation with her. Because it seems like she is putting in no effort and I’m e one initiating the convo
  ","
  If your friend keeps texting you but giving you short answers and one word responses I feel they aren’t interested in talking to you because usually when someone gives one word answers it means they have no interest in talking to you. Yeah it’s so horrible when you’re the only one putting in effort in trying to have a conversation and they except you to reply to them when all they give is one word. Honestly your friend doesn’t sound interested in having a conversation with you.

  Here are a few amazing people you should give a follow to!😊 ( sorry if I missed you)
  "
961040,"
   What makes you sad?
  ","
  Being left on read/open, doubting myself, overthinking, being gaslighted, manipulated, when someone just can’t seem to understand me, someone who says one thing with their words but doesn’t show me with their actions, etc!
  "
961041,"
   If someone liked you, how would you like them to tell you?
  ","
  I would just prefer for them to straight up tell him that they like me lol
  "
961042,"
   Didn't mean that ! Would you if I came off anon tho
  ","
  I don’t know lol
  "
961043,"
   Wall me x
  ","
  Sure thing anon
  "
961044,"
   Do you get more anon asks or more public asks?
  ","
  A mixture of both tbh
  "
961045,"
   About your response to your second chances question: What if the person who hurt you, hurt you accidentally? And she came to you and hugged you and told you she will do anything to make it up to you?
  ","
  I don’t know honestly, it’s from my past experiences. That’s why I don’t believe in second chances.
  "
961046,"
   Why do you and so many others seem convinced that Trump wont win? I mean, its not his first rodeo. People made the same prediction in 2016 and he still won.
  ","
  Because I’m positive this time around now that people have seen who he really is he won’t win anon.
  "
961047,"
   Are you a flower 🌺 person?
  ","

  "

  ","
  Is that so anon?
  "
961064,"
   Do you believe in second chances ? Or depends on the situation
  ","
  No I don’t believe in second chances tbh. In my experience once someone does something to hurt you they will more then likely do it once again and the cycle will repeat on and on until you just leave their life.
  "
961065,"
   Would like to marry me? 💍
  ","
  No, I don’t know who you are lol
  "
961066,"

  "
961068,"

  ","
  I’m not married, no
  "
961069,"
   when you have a baby do you want to know the gender straight away or wait until its born
  ","
  I don’t think I would want to know right away tbh but it also depends on what my husband would want
  "
961070,"

961083,"
   is depression a crime?
  ","
  No it’s not a crime
  "
961084,"
   Do you believe in love 😍 at first sight?
  ","
  No I don’t believe in love at fight sight. You can’t fall in love with someone at fight sight, that’s just not possible. And you don’t fall in love, that’s just the feeling. You actually grow in love with someone as you get to know them on a deeper level and maybe even feel a connection with them.
  "
961085,"
   How was your week?
  ","
  It’s been really stressful and crazy but it’s also been really good😁

  ","
  Noo I definitely wouldn’t
  "
961134,"
   Are you afraid of falling in love?
  ","
  Yes, I’m definitely afraid of falling in love again with someone new because every time I fall in love with someone I end up getting hurt or the relationship doesn’t work out. But yes, love scares me and the thought of falling in love again with someone scares me as well. I don’t know if it’ll happen though but I guess will see.  And you don’t really fall in love with someone that’s just the feeling, you grow in love with someone over time as you get to know them and hang out with them on a deeper level.  I guess only time will tell if I grow in love with someone.😬
  "

  "
961138,"
   What's more important eyes or teeth ?
  ","
  Well I feel both are pretty important tbh. You need your eyes to be able to see and you need your teeth to be healthy in order to have teeth as you grow older.
  "
961139,"
   How are you doing?

  ","
  Awh thank you! I needed this💕 you’re amazing!
  "
961174,"
   Is love complicated? Why?
  ","
  Oh yes love is beyond complicated because there can be many reasons to why it can be complicated. One reason can be communication, maybe whoever you’re in a relationship with isn’t a good communicator and so you just have to assume and overthink to what they’re thinking or feeling which is very depressing.
  "
961175,"

  Honestly no, I try not to judge people so easily or at all in fact.
  "
961181,"
   Ego masks demands for clarity... What is it means???
  ","
  “ the Ego is not who you really are. The Ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing. Your social mask thrives on approval. It wants control, and it is sustained by power, because it lives in fear.

   loneliness consumes us over time, regardless of strata, races or skin color, despite having materials or money.

  ","
  Dang this is really deep! I like it. But I absolutely agree with this because loneliness definitely does consumes us over time and sometimes it gets to the point where you’re just so used to being lonely already. You will never be able to fill the glasses left by people you thought were your friends. Also life is definitely a clock that keeps ticking every second so quickly it’s quite crazy.

  Yes haha, 11 more days!😁
  "
963054,"
   Do you believe that a person can change?
  ","
  No I don’t believe a person can change to be honest. In my experience once someone has done something once they will do it all over again. They might say they’re going to change or get better but they never do. People don’t change, they continue to do the same thing over and over again.
  "

  Yeah, I get what you’re saying and I hope so tbh. I just want to find the right person who I can spend my life with and grow in love with as well.

  "
963172,"
   🌻 Do you attract the right kind of people, or the wrong kind? Or is it relatively balanced? ☯️

   It's called romance Nicole. Slipping off, unbuttoning, unclasping, unzipping, gently pulling off, these are things you do for your woman sometimes instead of making her handle everything herself. Were these people raised in a barn?

  ","
  Oh lol I get what you mean 🥴
  "
963390,"
   True. If it was fair, I'd be with you. But then that wouldn't be fair to you. If it were fair to you, you'd be with Michele Moronne.

963393,"
   21 years ago our Sweet Nicole was preparing to be born within a couple weeks. Do you think you enjoy the heat because during your most advanced stages in the womb, it was during the summer, so you got used to higher temperatures?

  Because they don’t lol
  "
963407,"
   Because it's gorgeous. Anyone with taste would want to, and be delicate, making sure not to create any knots or make you uncomfortable. It being soothing for you would be the goal. I can't understand why someone with a chance wouldn't do that!
  ","
  Oh wow lol well thank you anon😊

  The way they present themselves to you and when they show you, you can’t trust them because they act so shady and suspicious is when I would say someone wasn’t raised right. That’s one sign, there’s many more.

  "
963962,"
   How would you react if you got a cute bunny, named Peter Rabbit, as a gift?

  That would be adorable

  I mean some people can make it confusing but I mean if someone’s attracted to you I’m pretty sure you could tell by their actions and the way they talk and interact with you and most importantly their body language. I think it’s the body language that will give it away if someone is attracted to you more than a friend.

  I just want a marriage that lasts forever you know and that fire and love doesn’t fade away
  "
964057,"
   What is your opinion of Marriage?
  ","
  I think it can be a beautiful thing if you find the one you want to spend your life with and grow in love with them a little bit more as each day goes by and to make sure they feel the same way about you. And that feeling that you felt when you first met shouldn’t go away. The love should keep growing every single day and not fade away. But in this society and generation marriage is a scary thing because what if one day they decide they just don’t love you anymore and leave like that. It’s scary.

  "
964266,"
   Why is it that most long distance relationships are unsuccessful ?
  ","
  That’s the million dollar question right here.
  
  I think most long distance relationships don’t work out due to trust and communication. I mean it’s very important to build trust with the person you’re in a relationship with long distance but it can be hard because you never know what they can be doing. Trust is so important to have when you’re in a relationship and if you don’t have that then there’s really no relationship between the two of you. I mean it takes time to build trust by not only their words but also their actions and if they show you, you can trust them then you’ll start to slowly be able to trust that person and not have to worry about them doing other things behind your back. But then on the other hand if they show you, you can’t trust them due to their actions and how they present themselves to you that’s a whole different story. But one factor in to why long distance relationships don’t work out is trust. You gotta have trust with the other person and slowly build it.
  
  The other factor would definitely be communication. I mean obviously if it’s long distance there’s going to be different time zones like you might be 3 hours behind and the person you’re with might be 3 hours ahead of you but that doesn’t mean anything if they really like you, they will communicate with you and talk to you and find the time to do so. No one is ever to “busy” to communicate with someone they really want and like. No matter how busy someone is they will find the time to communicate with you. People are busy but if they like you, they’ll call or text you. We make time for what we want. Communication is always key because if you don’t communicate with one another the partner can start to overthink and start to worry and you never want that, it’s not healthy. It’s important to always find the time to message one another no matter what. Keeping the communication alive is what is important in long distance relationships even in any relationship.
  
  Also another factor can be physical and showing affection. Obviously if you’re in a long distance relationship you can’t touch one another or show affection. That would be very difficult to do. Many people love holding hands, cuddling, kissing, sleeping next to each other, hugging, etc. And in long distance relationships you can’t do that so you can only really use your words to say what you would like to do with one another when you meet. That’s also why long distance relationships don’t work out. It’s craving one another’s touch and feeling that affection.
  
  I mean don’t get me wrong there’s many long distance relationships that do work out because they’re able to trust one another and communicate and plus build that strong emotional connection and feel those positive vibes off of one another. That strong connection that you can build with someone in a long distance relationship is quite amazing. Just being able to feel how strong of a connection you two have emotionally and mentally is always great.

  Etc.. 😁
  "
964271,"
   Have you ever fallen in love with a person who is in another relationship? How did you deal with this?

  No I’ve never fallen in love with a guy that was in another relationship. That hasn’t happened to me
  "
964272,"
   Can taste in music change your opinion about a person?
  ","
  I mean everyone has a different taste in music that makes them unique and interesting and that’s what makes it fun getting to know someone, learning about their music taste. It shouldn’t change your opinion on someone though as a person. Because everyone likes different kinds of music and that’s what’s cool. You also discover new music when meeting people.
  "
964273,"
   Should people pay more attention to other people than their phones?
  ","
  Yes, absolutely people should pay attention to other people rather then their phones but in this generation we are all glued to our phones and don’t pay attention to others or socialize anymore like a normal person would. It’s quite sad but in this generation and society that’s how it is.
  "
964274,"
   What do you find difficult to convey? (Ex. The feeling of love, the feeling of a broken heart, what something means to you)

   Why does alchohol make some people nice but makes other people violent?
  ","
  I haven’t seen it make some people nice to be honest. I think it makes some people violent only because they consume way too much alcohol and it takes over them and they don’t know how to act or think due to drinking too much. And then they become violent from consuming too much alcohol.
