Because of all the hate he took his life a few months after, and my (the brother) has never been the same since.\n  \n  I take this shit seriously, because it's not a joking matter and none of it is funny.

It's way more common than you think, but when I realized most people were like this I began stepping up for those who's voice kept getting shot down and made fun of.
