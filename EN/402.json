I left making only 8.50 people came in making way more then me. I got harassed multiple times by one of the store managers, one of the guy managers I think after he got fired because of him smoking in the store harassed me on Facebook asking me a couple inappropriate questions, they hardly ever let me leave on time, even when I told him if I didn\u2019t leave now, I wouldn\u2019t have a ride, he told me to figure it out, I rarely got any breaks. (Even tho I\u2019ve worked 12 hours before), I even had 4 new store managers over a few months if that says anything about them. And a few days before I quit, the new store manager made me go in the store by myself when the store was unlocked all night and my manager was an hour late at that time, so I was in there at 7am-8am with no one in there. And if someone snuck in the store, I could\u2019ve been serious hurt. It wasn\u2019t worth it, I was suffering when I worked there, I\u2019m still friends with one of my managers who worked there.
