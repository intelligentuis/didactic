actually be incredibly intelligent -- just not in the way that standard public schools \"see\" what intelligence is. these days, most schools solely teach for the rest and this leaves behind dozens of students who require more hands on lessons. not because they're stupid, but because they simply grasp ideas using different criteria.\n  \n  so imo, standardized tests like the SAT are a poor

oppressor solely due to being white, so i would appreciate it if you could stop putting words into my mouth.\n  \n  looking at the state of the world right now, it would be naive to say that those who are white experience the same racial indifferences as what people of color face on a daily basis solely due to their race. for example, i got pulled over by a cop a few months ago for speeding and i wasn't afraid. with what's been happening in the world lately, could i have felt the same if i was a person of color?\n  ","426083":"\n  that's the difference between dictionary definitions and sociological definitions, though. the meanings of words change as society progresses. what's written in a dictionary is static, and dictionary definitions don't take into consideration the societal implications of the words.\n  \n  theoretically, racial privilege CAN be removed -- if we fight to make people aware of it and, in turn, take steps to dismantle it. unfortunately, i don't see trust happening anytime soon, though.\n  ","426084":"\n  privilege is multifaceted, so this isn't really one of those \"yes or no\" answers.\n  \n  people who are white are privileged due to their race, because people of color have been oppressed by those who are white over the course of the centuries. people of color are still oppressed due to their race, unfortunately.\n  \n  however, obviously a person's race isn't the only aspect of who they are... you can experience oppression if you're gay, or trans, or of a certain ethnicity, or of a certain religion, or of a certain economic class, if you're mentally ill, if you're physically disabled, etc. you can simultaneously benefit from racial privilege while experiencing oppression and discrimination due to something else about who you are.\n  \n  as for bias, bias is taught. anyone can be biased against anyone else if that's how they were raised and they aren't given an opportunity, or want to take an opportunity, to unlearn that bias.\n  ","426085":"\n  why do you keep insisting my name is jess.\n  ","426086":"\n  the amount of ignorance i receive in my inbox literally confounds me.\n  ","426087":"\n  idk how to really answer this qhestion without repeating myself or stating the obvious.\n  \n  transgender people are more likely to be victims of abvse, assault, violence, etc etc. simply because they're transgender, because unfortunately transgender people aren't yet accepted in society and are looked upon as less than human, as wrong or vile, as sinful, as immature or foolish, as attention seeking, and the list goes on. we're not accepted in society for who we are, which places most transgender people in vulnerable positions.\n  ","426088":"\n  i'm really fucking sick and tired of transgender people being made to look like fools because of those who won't take the time to properly educate themselves on the scientific prospects of sex and gender.\n  \n  the average lifespan of a transgender person is 23 years old. transgender people have an alarmingly higher rate of svicide compared to cisgender people. nearly 90% of transgender people report experiencing discrimination in the world place. transgender people are more susceptible to being the victim of police violence and anti-LGBT homicide.\n  \n  the sad part is i could rattle off every statistic on the planet about transgender people, and you're

because i had nobody i could relate to or trust. and, thereafter, coping with the fact that its affected literally every aspect of who i am to the point where its fractured my very concept of myself.\n  \n  surviving svicide and living with the long term psychological and physical repurcussions that follow me to this very day (chronically wishing i was dead).\n  \n  i always survived because it was my instinct to survive, i was constantly in a state of fight or flight and i knew that if i stopped moving, then i would turn into something worse than death. now that i'm older and

be unhealthier than if they chose a meat-inclusive diet.\n  \n  not everyone can be vegan or vegetarian, for a plethora of reasons: medical illnesses, allergies, mental illnesses (such as eating disorders), socioeconomic reasons (lack of access or lack of funds to healthy vegan or vegetarian options), etc. in the same vein, it's important to realize that people can simultaneously advocate for

asshole, but either way, mental health is deserving of attention because it's a medical problem that millions of people suffer from and there are still too many misconceptions about most mental illnesses.\n  ","426146":"\n  happy halloween, fuckers.  ???\n  ","426147":"\n  haha thank you !!\n  ","426148":"\n  that's what i just said. i'm not going to vote on november 8th. one, because i

","426171":"\n  i can understand why you would think that, but it's actually true that radicalism doesn't reflect the beliefs of intersectional feminists. interpret that as you will, but unfortunately

i consider myself an over-achiever, yes. i known for a fact that my tendencies stem from my lack of self-esteem, because it makes me feel good about myself when i achieve something and ultimately get praised for it. i grew up with the idea of rejection always in the back of my mind, because every time i would be proud of something i accomplished, some minute\/insignificant thing would be focused on and totally invalidate everything else.\n  \n  idk about other people at all, but my innate desire for achievements and praise is 100% a result of the lack of validation and praise i received

assume that you HAVEN'T experienced those issues because she should know better than anyone that survivors often don't come forward with their stories, especially within the first few times of meeting a new counselor.\n  \n  second... for her to imply that *only* people with traumatic pasts could be \"exempt\" from something like that -- that's SO wrong of her to say. when we have depression or anxiety or more complex disorders that don't necessarily correlate with trauma, that doesn't mean that it isn't as difficult for some people to regulate their moods. and obviously if you're in counseling to begin with, you're already looking to get help with that. and who's to say that you arent already TRYING to make that choice?\n  \n  she shouldn't have said that at all, that's extremely discouraging. i'm sorry that happened to you. :\/\/\n  ","426182":"\n  idk anything about her perspectives, but from the little i've read online, she seems to be criticized often for not taking POC

of crying can be quite therapeutic.\n  ","426195":"\n  it's been really hard for me to distinguish a reason for any of this shit anymore.\n  \n  the more that i think about it, the more futile it appears to me and i cannot rationalize it any other way. regardless how much time i spend mulling it over in my mind, i fail to see any sense in it at all.\n  \n  life is defined by periods of utter destruction and chaos, followed by the disappointing routine of equilibrium. eventually, there comes a point where routine is a death sentence, and you're compelled to throw yourself into the arms of destruction because it's the only thing that has ever made you feel hopelessly alive, an old friend.\n  ","426196":"\n  yo my new GTA character is fucking badass looking, i love her so much omg.\n

negative connotation associated with that word and it degrades people who have mental illness or forces people to gander at them like museum artifacts as opposed to actual human beings with feelings.\n  \n  and if shoving pills down people's throats was enough to make people \"happy\" then jeez the whole mentally ill community would be happy as fuck lol. it isn't that simple obviously, everyone's combination of issues are unique, and what works for one person won't work for another. to simplify that by saying \"just take pills and be happy\" is so wrong.\n  ","426203":"\n  from my understanding, third wave feminism focuses on not only women's issues but issues with respect to oppressed groups as a whole: women, POC, dis\/abled people, neuroatypical people, people who fall on the gay or trans spectrum, religious sectors such as muslim or jewish people, etc etc.\n  \n  my only problem is that a majority of online rhetoric misconstrues the meaning behind feminism, placing blame on \"the patriarchy\" and wrongfully accusing men for all of the problems associated with the world. people become hysterical, irrational, and have such god complexes that its difficult to make ANY progress these days.\n  ","426204":"\n  there's a difference between being against the principles for which feminism stands for and not labeling yourself as a feminist.\n  \n  if you're talking about those who simply don't want to associate themselves with third wave feminism, but still hold the same principles, then i think you're overreacting. a label doesn't define who you are -- and tbh your views on people who don't want to associate themselves with feminism are just as bad as the views of radical feminists, who are the people who have been giving feminism a bad name to begin with.\n  ","426205":"\n  this is a weird question because i have a minimal number of legitimate friends, and it's not as if it's something that happens in a matter of seconds?\n  \n  friendship is

rustling UNDER THE PART OF THE PORCH I WAS STANDING ON.\n  \n  my area is known for having asshole raccoons, so i was terrified that a raccoon was under me. so i just sat there smoking my cigarette, and i waited. the rustling moved from beneath me all the way to the corner of the porch, and then this fatass bunny DARTED OUT OF MY PORCH AND ACROSS MY YARD.\n  \n  the fucker almost gave me a heart

the chance to continuously learn new things everyday.\n  \n  as for what i know more of than the average person: social security law, circuit court case laws, the loopholes in the social security system, and mental illnesses. i read and write about social security law on a daily basis, and a majority of the cases i specialize in are those with mental disabilities. over the years, my company

","426224":"\n  i agree with you. we have to attack the stigma from its roots as opposed to mindlessly aiming for the branches individually. by lessening the stereotype on young girls that they have to behave a certain way or be involved in certain things, there will end up being more diversity naturally.\n  ","426225":"\n  it ties into the idea that society perpetuates the stigma that women are catered to performing domestic-like jobs, while men are catered to performing jobs in positions of power.\n  \n  i'm not saying throw the men out of office -- that's illogical, ridiculous, and counterproductive.\n  \n  however, society needs to change the fact that women are pressured from a young age to portray a certain image and engage in gender-based roles, to think about themselves in terms of their sex as opposed to their passions and skills. there would be more women in politics if there wasn't the social stigma that women don't \"belong\" in office or \"belong\" in occupations that aren't domestic in nature.\n  \n  i hope this makes more sense.\n  ","426226":"\n  yes. there's an insufficient amount of representation in the political sphere (in the US, at least. i'm not too

didn't get the attention they deserved.\n  \n  the idea of hating all law enforcement is, in my opinion, radical because the large majority of law enforcement do their job that they're supposed to do. unfortunately, there will always be bad seeds mixed in, and what needs to be emphasized should be the proper punishments placed on those cops who fuck up instead of giving them paid leave and the

us.\n  ","426320":"\n  it isn't selfish of me to continue living at my parents' house despise the fact that i have a toxic relationship with them. considering this is doing more damage to me than good, i don't understand how that would constitute as \"selfish.\"\n  \n  my options at the present moment are to continue living with a roof over my head but be subjected to toxic relations, or be homeless. this isn't a selfish decision.\n  ","426321":"\n  being fascinated by a topic doesn't give you free reign over people's personal, and often traumatic, experiences.\n  \n  people with mental illness aren't test subjects for you to poke and prod. if you're interested in psychology, then find scholarly articles and abstracts discussing psychological symptoms.\n  ","426322":"\n  oh, so donald trump then. hahah.\n  \n  i'm not a trust fund baby, my family grew up with little to no money and we've survived going from paycheck to paycheck. everything that i currently own is something that i've worked hard to obtain.\n  ","426323":"\n  these aren't necessarily unpopular but they need to be said:\n  \n  \u2727  you are not under any obligation to tell your story or explain your scars. you do not owe the world anything for the experiences you've survived. your story and your body are not forums of discussion for others to pluck like a field of weeds. just because you have revealed a small portion of yourself does not mean you are under any obligation to confess the rest of your story. fuck anyone who says otherwise.\n  \n  \u2727  you are under no contract to remain in contact with family who has not treated you the way you are supposed to be treated. releasing yourself from toxicity is part of the healing process, and anyone who attempts to guilt you into staying is part of the problem and not worth your time. it is ok to detach yourself from toxic family members and you are not obligated to remain civil simply because of blood ties.\n  ","426324":"\n  i don't

plethora of experience in politics, she's respectful and calculated in her mannerisms, and she knows when and when not to provide her opinion.\n  \n  the same can't be said about trump. yes, they both have horrible skeletons in their closet, but when it comes down to thinking about the future of this country and what risks and decisions will have to be taken -- the idea of a trump-guided system will undoubtedly be poorly executed, impulsive, and premature. he will prompt a nuclear arms race. he will not be willing to diffuse a situation when it needs to be diffused. i'm literally scared for the future of this country under a trump dictatorship (because democracy won't exist anymore).\n  \n  so no... people don't necessarily \"support\" clinton in the way you probably assume, they simply recognize the better of two shitty options.\n  ","426337":"\n  i struggle with the same irrational fear literally 24\/7 -- if someone laughs around me, i assume they're making fun of me. i overthink people's statements and conclude that they either feel sorry for me or they're faking their concern towards me in an attempt to ridicule me. if i get up and walk down the hall, i assume people are staring at me. and if people are even looking in my direction, i assume something is wrong with my face or my clothing and it makes me self conscious.\n  \n  it isn't necessarily a normal thing to feel, but it IS extremely common -- it's a side effect of low self esteem and probably anxiety, because this is a big problem of mine when it comes to my social anxiety. i've been going to therapy to help myself understand these fears and overcome them.\n  \n  if you can do so, i would suggest the same to you. CBT is designed to help people acknowledge these unhealthy thought patterns, recognize the root of the problem, and work towards developing healthier ways of thinking. by working with a therapist you get along with and feel comfortable around, you'll learn to dismantle your negative thought patterns and promote a sense of well being.\n  ","426338":"\n  rofl it's honestly fine, i'm really happy that i'm at least able to help you !! :))\n  ","426339":"\n  idk on the one hand we should be open minded obviously, yes, and realize that people who are racist and sexist and all of those ~ lovely ~ things are that way because that's how they were raised. however that doesn't mean that we're supposed to sit back and allow them to spew their problematic thoughts all over the place -- ESPECIALLY if those people are in positions of power and authority.\n  \n  everyone will obviously have their own opinions regardless of what people say, yeah. but idk i wouldn't consider it to be \"open minded\" if we just let those people have their way because that's so detrimental to society in so many ways.\n  ","426340":"\n  look at the last photo i just posted and the fact that there are more stuffed

& trump and i'm fucking dying.\n  ","426343":"\n  the great thing about college is that you're not obligated to stay in the classroom for any reason other than your own enjoyment of the subject -- you can leave when you want, especially if you feel unsafe, and just inform the professor later on that the conversation was affecting you in that way.\n  \n  i understand your fear, i was kinda the same way before i entered college too. but you're going to be ok. \u2661\n  ","426344":"\n  (i got your second message !!)\n  \n  you asked if you were being dramatic -- no, not at all. trump is honestly a disgusting individual, his perspectives on mental illness and women and race are deplorable and for someone with that mentality to be placed in such a high position of power is honestly terrifying.\n  \n  all of the progress we've made in the last 60 years would be gone. while disadvantaged and marginalized groups still don't have equal rights, they do have SOME rights, and under trump, it's likely that all of this progress would be undermined and we'd end up going backwards -- not forwards.\n  \n  at this point it isn't just politics and it isn't just having an opinion, because for someone to defend trump for what he's done and said proves that they're part of the problem. being racist or sexist or ableist isn't an opinion, it's a personality flaw and something like that dictates how you carry yourself or live your life.\n  \n  so no, you're not being dramatic. you're being rational, tbh. it's normal to have such a strong reaction to these things because he isn't just one person, this is reflected in a large part of the public's eyes.\n  ","426345":"\n  tbh i would feel weird writing stereotypes about my mental illnesses because right now, i'm only diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. while there is stigma attached to those disorders, there's a hell of a lot more attached to other mood disorders, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, and dissociative disorders.\n  \n  i would feel as if i'm furthering those stigmas if i chose to talk about my disorders rather than all of the others, idk.\n  ","426346":"\n  can we just\n

makes no sense for a person to actively advocate against and refuse to use someone's pronouns even when asked.\n  \n  to you, their gender may mean nothing -- but obviously to that person, their

what to say and what not to say depending on the environment. most users on askfm, for example, have no sense of online etiquette whatsoever (the anons at least) -- the ones who send out sexually explicit questions to minors, people who probe into problems despite the user telling them that they're uncomfortable, continuously messaging someone expecting them to answer when they're offline, etc etc.\n  \n  i suppose it's somewhat important to me, because i believe that most people deserve basic respect and a majority of online etiquette is respecting the other person's thoughts and wishes. however, a lot of people still believe that if you're on social media, you're obligated to reveal 100% of your life, which is obviously false.\n  ","426370":"\n  i'd ask my abuser if they knew that

make a long story short, what was once a date turned into a ranting session of me pouring my heart out to this poor kid about what was going on between me and my boyfriend and asking the kid for

sex for the first time (even when she's as young as preteen years) and men also face discrimination from their peers if they're found that they haven't engaged in sex.\n  \n  it's all based on the

i keep thinking about it.\n  \n  i told her that when i'm not with my boyfriend, i get super lonely and depressed -- especially at night -- and i didn't understand why because lately i've been ok during the daytime. she shrugged her shoulders a little and went, \"well maybe you just miss him. it could be something as simple as that.\"\n  \n  idk why but it really... got under my skin in a weird way. there's a difference between me missing someone and then me lapsing into depression because i'm alone and then i further isolate myself because my mind goes Crazy\u2122 and into overdrive mode.\n  \n  like... she didn't mean anything bad by it, i know, but i feel like she's downplaying my feelings ?? or perhaps i'm just really bad at describing my symptoms or minimizing my symptoms ??

friendships, and eventually you will find someone who completes your world perhaps even more than you think this person did.\n  \n  i'm not saying this to be rude, i'm saying it because it's the truth. it's perfectly ok to be upset, you have every valid reason to be. but don't let those feelings take over you or ruin you. you're worthy of love, and you'll find someone else to share in that

more people are diagnosed with them than the public generally thinks, and there's still so much bias and false opinions regarding those diagnosed with them. by raising objective and valid awareness
