mainly wear hoodies, jeans, and boots.\n  \n  i can't remember the last time i actually went to a mall either. it's probably been at least 5-6 years.\n  ","416427":"\n  not quite, no. although i do admit that my unhappiness with my body is somewhat correlated with my gender, considering i have feminine features that i don't feel comfortable having.\n  \n  my gender dates back further than the development of my secondary sex characteristics, though. i knew from a young age that i wasn't a \"girl,\" i just didn't have a name to put to the feeling until the past few years.\n  ","416428":"\n  i'm not confused about my gender, so i don't have gender dysphoria. however, i do have body dysmorphia which is sometimes confused with gender dysphoria.\n  ","416429":"\n  he asks me whenever we have to go out somewhere together -- i.e. choosing one shirt over the other, which belt & shoes combo to wear that will match the shirt, etc etc. i've honestly always thought that it was adorable.\n  \n  he doesn't do the same thing for me, though, lmao. i'll ask him which outfit & he'll just tell me i look good in everything, which ... isn't helpful. hahah.\n  ","416430":"\n  i'm on lamictal. i've asked my psychiatrist countless times if drinking on this medication is okay, and she's always told me that drinking in moderation is fine, so i've always taken her word for it.\n  \n  just keep in mind that sometimes alcohol can counter the effects of some medications, especially psych meds, so if you're feeling \"off\" the following day then it could be due to the mixture of the alcohol and the meds.\n  ","416431":"\n  tips ;\n  \n  -- remember to drink water while drinking alcohol!! it's the best way to avoid getting too drunk and getting a hangover.\n  \n  -- stick to one type of drink the entire night, whether it's all liquor, all wine, or all beer. mixing it can upset your stomach.\n  \n  -- don't feel pressured to continue drinking if you think you've had enough. tell your friend(s) you want to stop and drink water for the rest of the night.\n  \n  -- if you think you might get a hangover in the morning, take ibuprofen and eat a snack before bed & keep a water bottle next to your bed.\n  ","416432":"\n  why the hell did i spend an hour downloading this game last night only to wake up & see that it needs another 50 GB of additional updates ?!\n  \n  this is going to take forever, ughhhh.\n  ","416433":"\n  i don't really have one, i seldom go shopping to begin with. the last time i bought clothing for myself (besides the brewery pullover yesterday) was a few months ago when i was shopping in target.\n  ","416434":"\n  i'd love to hear what my boyfriend's dog is thinking, lmao. he's such a sneaky little dude, but he's also so caring and protective.\n  ","416435":"\n  my stomach, haha. i can't stand it.\n  ","416436":"\n  why is this pertinent information.\n  ","416437":"\n  ???\n  \n  how ?? lmao. i make myself cups of water every day.\n  ","416438":"\n  i'm sure you're not the only person who feels that way.\n  ","416439":"\n  it depends entirely on the relationship and the individual. some people are more open about their pasts while others prefer to keep it private.\n  \n  it seems that a lot of people like to wait a little bit to get to know their partner first before asking about their past sexual history, depending on comfort levels. there's also the idea of \"what's in the past is in the past\" and it doesn't matter anymore. so if you want to ask your partner about their history, then that's entirely up to you.\n  ","416440":"\n  i tried to go to bed, but couldn't sleep after tossing and turning for 20 minutes. so i decided to have a cigarette and make myself a cup of water until i get tired.\n  ","416441":"\n  it would depend on the context of the breakup. if the relationship simply wasn't working anymore & we mutually agreed to break up, then i think we could still remain friends. we're each other's best friend, after all. he always tells me how i'm his best friend just as much as i'm his partner.\n  \n  however, if he cheated on me or did something else that would completely break my trust in him, i don't think i could still be his friend.\n  ","416442":"\n  i'm not sure what their target audience is tbh. either way, that doesn't change the fact that people 30+ can use askfm as they please as long as they're not breaking any community guidelines.\n  ","416443":"\n  i suppose my boyfriend has had the most positive influence on me over the years, especially toward the beginning of our relationship. he's the person who supported me when i tried to stop SHing, and as we've gotten older, his love, support, and encouragement has showed me ways in which to love myself.\n  ","416444":"\n  i don't think there's a zenith to where people reach the peak of their wisdom or maturity. as you get older, you constantly grow and evolve as a human, even when you're approaching upper ages. if you ask any elderly person, i'm sure they would tell you that they still matured and learned things even during the latter years of their lives.\n  ","416445":"\n  uh ... since when is 30 old ?? lmaoo.\n  \n  i'm approaching 30 myself, my dude. nevertheless, people can use askfm as long as they're over the age of 13. there's no age cap when it comes to ask, and there are dozens of people who are 30+ on here. people are free to do what they want as long as they're not breaking the terms & conditions.\n  ","416446":"\n  i don't hate it, but i normally delete sexual questions because i don't answer that sort of thing on askfm.\n  ","416447":"\n  i think it would be in terms of dating, yeah. how can you have fun with someone if you can't even laugh with them ?? i'm lucky in that all of my friends and my boyfriend make me laugh every time i'm with them, idk if i would still be their friend if they had no sense of humor.\n  ","416448":"\n  anyone have any questions ?? i can't sleep. :\/\/\n  ","416449":"\n  yeah, we do. often we both find things funny that other people don't seem to find funny at all, so we're sitting there giggling like children while everyone else is just confused. lmao.\n  ","416450":"\n  i remade my xbox avatar, the hair needed to be updated. :'))\n  ","416451":"\n  i haven't attended school since 2013.\n  ","416452":"\n  i disagree with the concept that women *owe* their partners sex -- people's bodies, regardless of their gender, are theirs and theirs alone. sex is not an obligation in a relationship, and sex also doesn't guarantee that a partner won't be unfaithful either.\n  \n  everyone's relationship is different, and some place more emphasis on sex than others. in cases where someone expects a lot of sex, then yeah -- they might look elsewhere if their needs aren't being satisfied (ideally they should talk to their partner first, but we all know a lot of people would rather cheat than do that). however, that's between those two people and other people's opinions on an individual relationship are meaningless.\n  ","416453":"\n  i'm not saying it's right or wrong -- i'm just offering you an explanation as to why\n  \n   @CelineM96\n  \n  answers the way she does. not that you need any sort of justification, either way.\n  \n  personally speaking, i don't care if someone uses slang, poor grammar, etc etc. as long as i understand what they're trying to say then i'll answer the question (within reason, lol). but you're the one who brought celine up in the first place because you're salty over the way she treats some anons (which probably includes you), so now you're likely just angry because i refuse to participate in your sh*t-talking.\n  ","416454":"\n  they're both slang, and it makes more sense to type \"how're you\" than \"how's you\" because that's how we're taught to speak. we're not taught to say \"how is you\" because that doesn't make much sense.\n  \n  \"ain't\" is also slang more prevalent to some areas of the country than others, and where\n  \n   @CelineM96\n  \n  and i are from, nobody uses that term.\n  ","416455":"\n  veggie burgers !! i prefer them over beef burgers, they're so much tastier and versatile.\n  ","416456":"\n\n   @CelineM96\n  \n  isn't uptight about grammar. celine just doesn't like when people go out of their way to make a sentence sound ridiculous when you can just as easily type it normally.\n  \n  it takes more effort to abbreviate everything and use slang than it does to just type regularly, and that's also something that has always confounded me.\n  ","416457":"\n  is it really \"once again\" if we're talking about the same candle ?? lmfaooo.\n  ","416458":"\n  i would love to continue receiving your questions !! i hope you have a great new year. \u2661\n  \n  as a filler -- here's my view for the night. mike shinoda is blessing me with this cold, cozy beer.\n  ","416459":"\n  yeah, but i'm really picky on where i order it from or which brand to make.\n  ","416460":"\n  depends on what they're ranting about, lmao. if it's something stupid that they really shouldn't complain about, then i'll hear them out but i won't enjoy it at all.\n  ","416461":"\n  no. i don't care enough about other people's grammar to make assumptions in the first place.\n  \n  it's social media. grammar doesn't matter here, lol.\n  ","416462":"\n  it depends if you guys are still on civil terms & the general vibe between you two. however, in most cases i would think it isn't necessary and may only lead to complications in your relationship\/friendship\/whatever.\n  \n  especially if you bring up the breakup. you don't know how they feel about it so the conversation could turn ugly really fast. i would just avoid it entirely.\n  ","416463":"\n  no, that's just unrealistic. there have been plenty of times where i was in the wrong, and there will be plenty of more times in the future where he will have to point out my behavior or thought processes and inform me that i'm wrong.\n  \n  you shouldn't be in a relationship with a person who *always* insists that they're right even if they're absolutely wrong. it's a red flag and it can lead to manipulative behavior.\n  ","416464":"\n  the dinosaur ?? idk. chickens aren't the only animals that lay eggs, lmao.\n  ","416465":"\n  eggs existed way before chickens did, so i'm assuming the egg. dinosaurs were apparently hatched out of eggs.\n  ","416466":"\n  not really. i don't care enough to get into arguments with people.\n  ","416467":"\n  driving -- basically all aspects of driving, especially when it comes to other drivers and traffic and whatnot. it makes me so angry when people cut other people off, don't use their blinkers, assume they have the right of way when they don't, weave recklessly in and out of traffic, drive below the speed limit, etc etc.\n  ","416468":"\n  i think it's a bit cliche, tbh. obviously it doesn't affect me personally so i shouldn't care, but i always thought that proposing on a holiday (xmas or valentine's day especially) was a bit corny.\n  ","416469":"\n  i had two tastings of different beers & a full sized pint of another kind of beer (an IPA with hints of cherry & vanilla).\n  ","416470":"\n  i got to drink & hang out with these cuties today !!\n  ","416471":"\n  mainly working. however, between yesterday & today, my boyfriend and i took a mini vacation out to the vineyard region of long island. we went to a new brewery earlier this afternoon, which was a lot of fun.\n  ","416472":"\n  well, i certainly hope my boyfriend likes me.\n  ","416473":"\n  i think it depends entirely on circumstance. i don't bring my boyfriend around my family either, but my family knows that he exists obviously.\n  ","416474":"\n  for the most part, yes. i also contribute when i can, though, for things such as groceries.\n  ","416475":"\n  i don't believe he's single, actually. he's very closed off when it comes to his personal life (for good reason, tbh). i have a feeling he has a girlfriend but doesn't want to tell my family.\n  ","416476":"\n  yes, i think that would be hella interesting. it might also give me insight into who i am in this current life as well.\n  ","416477":"\n  no, he's heterosexual.\n  ","416478":"\n  i'm not really poor because i have enough money to live comfortably, and it would be wrong for me to say \"i'm poor\" considering there are so many other people who are worse off financially than me.\n  ","416479":"\n  it isn't something i feel comfortable discussing. i'd also appreciate it if you guys would stop asking me questions about death as well.\n  ","416480":"\n  i have a sibling already, so this question doesn't pertain to me.\n  ","416481":"\n  no. i already have an inkling of how i might die anyway.\n  ","416482":"\n  in that case, it's a good thing that i don't believe hell exists then.\n  ","416483":"\n  no, i'm not afraid of death. i've come too close to death too many times on my own accord to really be fearful of it. i've already made my peace.\n  ","416484":"\n  i don't know what i believe, tbh. i'd like to think that our souls become reincarnated into another living creature, but there's also a part of me that just thinks we disintegrate into the earth.\n  ","416485":"\n  my hair isn't a natural color & i don't think anyone would take it, especially considering how short it is.\n  ","416486":"\n  i'm not religious & i don't believe in sins.\n  ","416487":"\n  tbh i would freak the f*ck out if i found out that my hair was thinning. my hair is everything to me, lol. luckily i have a mop of really thick hair, so i don't have to worry about that happening.\n  ","416488":"\n  it depends on what they did on their first chance. some people i'm apt to forgive, but i won't forgive serious transgressions.\n  ","416489":"\n  i've surprisingly never heard any gossip about me. lol. i've always maintained a low profile.\n  ","416490":"\n  i don't go swimming.\n  ","416491":"\n  no, i have no reason to wear a bikini.\n  ","416492":"\n  i don't have any of those, and i wouldn't post one even if i did. my body is atrocious.\n  ","416493":"\n  no. i don't answer sxxual questions.\n  ","416494":"\n  i don't remember if i had any resolutions at the start of 2018. i probably didn't because life tends to happen and a lot of people don't follow through with their resolutions, including me. i would rather set smaller goals for myself.\n  \n  i do want to start eating healthier than i currently am and start going back to the gym, or at least work out at home somehow. i fell off the wagon a few months ago and i've been needing to get back to a fitness routine desperately.\n  ","416495":"\n  i'm most comfortable with the company of my boyfriend & close friends, as well as one or two of my coworkers. i'm not close with my family at all so i'm not comfortable being around them, so i prefer the company of pretty much anyone else.\n  ","416496":"\n  the last time i was surprised was on xmas eve. my boyfriend bought me three beautiful necklaces, and i basically had no idea what to do because i obviously can't wear all three at once, LOL.\n  \n  i'm going to rotate wearing them, but regardless, i was so surprised because they were all beautiful and he didn't have to go out of his way to buy me three different ones.\n  ","416497":"\n  i believe in a \"right\" person, but i also believe that there are multiple \"right\" people when it comes to love. i disagree with the idea that everyone only has one soulmate, because there are countless people in this world and you're bound to have amazing connection with at least one person.\n  ","416498":"\n  family feud is HILARIOUS to me. i don't normally watch game shows but i'll watch it if i'm scrolling & see that its on.\n  ","416499":"\n  drink ginger tea. it's one of the only things that helps me.\n  ","416500":"\n  i don't believe i have, no.\n  ","416501":"\n  i value my alone time and

 although its only 10am rn, i can't even think about sweets without getting nauseous, lol.\n  ","416503":"\n  i don't like picking favorites -- i enjoy reading the answers of everyone i follow, which is obviously why i follow them.\n  ","416504":"\n  i swear occasionally, but i mostly refrain from swearing on askfm because i don't want my answers to get deleted.\n  ","416505":"\n  no, none of my jobs had those.\n  ","416506":"\n  probably, but i would really have to think about what i'm going to say before i say it. swearing is second nature to me, lmao.\n  ","416507":"\n  aw, thanks ~~\n  ","416508":"\n  is that when you see how many marshmallows you can shove into your mouth ?? lmao.\n  ","416509":"\n  no ?? that's gross.\n  ","416510":"\n  if you feel it's necessary, sure.\n  ","416511":"\n  i don't know anyone who follows through with their resolutions. it's easier to take each step at a time rather than expect yourself to live up to an expectation.\n  ","416512":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","416513":"\n  i'll have to look it up !! i've never heard of it before.\n  ","416514":"\n  i usually notice their eyes and their smile.\n  ","416515":"\n  i play poker with my boyfriend's friends, but those are the only card games i play.\n  ","416516":"\n  no, i don't like her music at all.\n  ","416517":"\n  my day dragged, but i got out of work early, so that's a plus -- i just got home and it isn't even 4pm yet.\n  \n  the only thing bothering me is that my stomach has been killing me ever since i ate lunch. i don't know what didn't agree with me since its all food i've eaten before.\n  ","416518":"\n  no, it isn't something that concerns me at the moment.\n  ","416519":"\n  that's not cheating, and no, it doesn't anger me. my boyfriend texts his coworkers all the time -- everyone is allowed to talk to their friends, coworkers included. to tell someone that they can't text a certain person outside of work is hella controlling.\n  ","416520":"\n  are you talking about the transformer that blew in queens which made the sky blue ??\n  \n  yeah -- i want to believe.\n  ","416521":"\n  it wasn't offensive at all !! you raised some excellent points.\n  ","416522":"\n  this too. ^^\n  \n  i think they were mainly just trying to get a rise out of me, which obviously won't work. it doesn't offend me if people misgender me because it says a whole lot more about them than it does about me.\n  ","416523":"\n  negative self-talk, low self esteem, and some of the weight i've gained over the past year, lol.\n  ","416524":"\n  i've heard that they can be domesticated, but idk if that necessarily means that they would be a good pet. i certainly hope so though, foxes are adorable.\n  ","416525":"\n  pretty much all the time, yeah. sometimes it's difficult for me to balance my work life with my social life, although i do admit that it used to be a lot more difficult when i was also attending college.\n  ","416526":"\n  contrary to popular belief, there is such a thing as a singular \"they.\" the AP stylebook updated their guidelines about a year ago stating that when someone has gender-neutral pronouns, it's acceptable to refer to them as \"they\/them.\"\n  ","416527":"\n  i'm happily in a relationship.\n  ","416528":"\n  i've never followed through on my resolutions, so i prefer to make little goals throughout the year.\n  ","416529":"\n  chocolate chip cookie dough ftw.\n  ","416530":"\n  spending xmas eve with my boyfriend and his family was the highlight of my holiday thus far. :'))\n  \n  this weekend, we're also going to visit a local brewery that has live music so that should be fun too.\n  ","416531":"\n  i eat it occasionally, sure.\n  ","416532":"\n  they're sooo good, omg. if you're ever in new york, order them from a bakery and they'll be the best cookies you've ever eaten.\n  ","416533":"\n  not really. the only desserts i eat are cannolis and rainbow cookies.\n  ","416534":"\n  no,

been thinking about work since it consists of most of my time. assignments, deadlines, my commute, etc etc.\n  \n  otherwise, i'm thinking about my boyfriend, my friends, coffee, and alcohol. my mind

","416541":"\n  not everyone enjoys being complimented. personally, i only like compliments from my boyfriend & close friends.\n  ","416542":"\n  everyone has likes & dislikes. i personally dislike adjectives that are feminine, i.e. beautiful, gorgeous, etc etc.\n  ","416543":"\n  it depends on what they said after the initial statement. in most cases, the person prefaces their thoughts with \"don't take this the wrong way\" when they already know that what they think is potentially offensive, but they want to say it anyway.\n  ","416544":"\n  please don't call me beautiful, i dislike that adjective.\n  \n  this weekend should be fun, though. my boyfriend and i are driving out east to the vineyards tomorrow night, and we're going to a brewery on saturday where there will be live music.\n  ","416545":"\n  plenty of times, yeah. one person in particular always deflects blame onto other people and never takes responsibility for their own actions.\n  ","416546":"\n  yeah, my

my \"party stage\" between the ages of 19 and 21, for the most part. i would get drunk almost every night and then i eventually grew out of the stage. idk why i started to begin with -- i guess it had to do with the fact that i never wanted to be home and i was always angry and depressed.\n  ","416558":"\n  nah, i'm good. likes are meaningless.\n  ","416559":"\n  i don't follow people upon

a fan of that name, it sounds like a little girl's name to me, lol.\n  ","416565":"\n  i don't believe i have, no. but they sell the bottles in liquor stores around here, and my boyfriend's family

go through and creates a kink out of people's trauma. it's gross.\n  ","416648":"\n  i'm sorry you're feeling this way -- i've been in the same boat myself, although with mental illness not physical illness. i know how horrible and isolating it feels to get so low that you contemplate ending your life.\n  \n  have you tried seeking professional counseling to help you handle your thoughts ?? physical health undoubtedly affects mental health and its always healthy to pursue mental health treatment especially if you think you're in danger.\n  ","416649":"\n  no, i like to save money on

each other gifts beforehand, it just sorta happened and we all somehow found a night to meet up and exchange.\n  \n  i guess buying them their gifts was a \"good deed,\" lol. it was so nice to see

gifts.\n  ","416680":"\n  the only person who can guaranteed make me smile if i'm not feeling well is my boyfriend. he always somehow finds a way to make me smile or laugh even when i'm in the darkest throes of depression.\n  ","416681":"\n  i have no idea what you're talking about. however, any question is appreciated as long as it isnt invasive or inappropriate.\n  ","416682":"\n  no, it's only

only get hate when it comes to my smoking habit which is why i assumed it was a judgey question.\n  \n  originally i started smoking to calm myself down because of stress and anxiety, and then i

they need help and don't hesitate to reach out to you if they need anything at all. allow them to talk and vent.\n  ","416712":"\n  i've had to give statements to the police before, but i've never

old, but it was also a highlight of my life. i got the opportunity to tell chester how much him and his music meant to me, and it was such an amazing moment.\n  ","416764":"\n  i love him. i got the chance to meet him a few months ago during a poster signing at a local record store, and it was one of the best moments of my life.\n  ","416765":"\n  the only jesus i worship is mike shinoda.\n  ","416766":"\n  the whole \"females are bad drivers\" thing is a false stereotype, actually. someone's ability to drive isn't determined by their sex or gender.\n  \n  i'm a really cautious driver due to my anxiety, but unfortunately that isn't enough to prevent certain accidents.\n  ","416767":"\n  LOL. yeah, new york drivers are ridiculous -- particularly city drivers and drivers from long island.\n  ","416768":"\n  yes, i've been in quite a few. thankfully none of them were my fault nor was i injured, but getting into those accidents have only made my anxiety worse because you never know when an accident can happen.\n  ","416769":"\n  the probability of getting into an accident and getting hurt is so high, and it plagues me every day. there are also the moments where i get the impulse to do something erratic on the road, so sometimes i don't trust myself driving which makes my anxiety worse.\n  ","416770":"\n  driving is my biggest source of anxiety, actually.\n

diabetes, everything is affected and you're better off without it in the long run.\n  ","416772":"\n  he doesn't drink usually, and when he does, he usually orders a captain & diet coke. he hasn't drank beer in a really long time because it raises his blood sugar too much.\n  ","416773":"\n  i totally understand this. my boyfriend is a type one diabetic so he always watches what he eats and has

myself some dinner and i might watch netflix soon.\n  ","416779":"\n  i like chocolate, but i'm not obsessed with it like some people are. i prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate & i can only have it in really small quantities.\n  ","416780":"\n  i generally don't. however, my best friend puts cinnamon in her ground coffee before she makes a pot & it tastes delicious.\n  ","416781":"\n  no, i've never traveled outside of the united states before.\n  ","416782":"\n  sleeping in & not having to set an alarm !! i usually wake up around 8 or 9am anyway, but it's a hell of a lot better than being forced to wake up at 7am.\n  ","416783":"\n  rofl, no. i dislike trump for obvious reasons, but i don't hate him. hatred is meant for something personal.\n  ","416784":"\n  i'd rather not

mike shinoda prayer candle off of etsy, LOL. i was so confused at first, and then i looked at the face and started laughing hysterically.\n  ","416788":"\n  we did !! we exchanged gifts yesterday,

anything. :'))\n  ","416790":"\n  uh ... is this supposed to be an acronym for something ??\n  ","416791":"\n  no. i'm pretty neutral towards humanity. the only things i'm certain that i love are people whom i'm close with in my life.\n  ","416792":"\n  no, i'm sure that most people are certainly loved by at least one person, whether it's friends or family or significant others.\n  ","416793":"\n  i'm assuming this was supposed to be some sort of poetic statement, but instead it came out as intensely creepy and horrifying. great job, dude.\n  ","416794":"\n  i would advise against that. i kinda need them to see, and also that would taste absolutely horrid.\n  ","416795":"\n  no. the older i get, the more i realize that upper ages aren't as \"old\" as i used to think they were when i was younger.\n  ","416796":"\n  that doesn't surprise me. people have told me that i'm intimidating before.\n  ","416797":"\n  i'll have to see if any of my friends are doing anything for new years eve. i requested off from work because i wanted the four-day weekend (the office is closed on new years day), but i don't have any plans to celebrate yet.\n  \n  usually i celebrate with my boyfriend, but i think he's working until 10pm on new years eve and again starting at 9am the next morning, so i'm not sure if i'll get to see him.\n  ","416798":"\n  i'm not dreading it at all

cleaning. yeah, that's going to be oodles of fun.\n  ","416800":"\n  there's a comedian whom i saw perform live a few months ago, his name is dan soder (i think that's his name). he has a really dark sense of humor and i was cracking up at his comedy show.\n  ","416801":"\n  i'm doing well. my office let us leave at 4pm instead of 4:30pm today, which was really nice. i was able to sort through some boxes when i got home in order to see what i bought people for xmas and separate them accordingly.\n  \n  right now, i'm just drinking some coffee and checking up on social media. i'm going to listen to music and clean in a little bit.\n  ","416802":"\n  everything, lmao.\n  \n  some of the things that really bother me, though, are people who spread ignorance without doing proper research first, especially if their ideologies are inherently racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, transphobic, antisemitic, etc etc.\n  \n  i also really dislike when people feel entitled to certain privileges just for simply existing because they've been spoiled rotten their entire lives, and they view other people who don't have the same privilege as inferior to them.\n  ","416803":"\n  one of my friends is actually getting married today, and i'm so happy for her & her husband !! they're a beautiful couple and i wish i could take part in their celebration.\n  ","416804":"\n  my boyfriend's resilience. he's endured so much hardship and struggle with a variety of things & he still perseveres every day. he always puts 200 percent into everything he does regardless of how he's feeling, and it's something i've always admired about him.\n  ","416805":"\n  that sounds like a recipe for disaster. if you've ever seen the movie gattaca, you would understand why.\n  ","416806":"\n  my coffee, lmao. don't even take a sip of it, that irritates me completely. if you want coffee, then get your damn own.\n  ","416807":"\n  depends on my mood that day. sometimes i get annoyed really easily, while other times, nothing bothers me at all.\n  ","416808":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry.\n  ","416809":"\n  perhaps if you stopped feeling sorry for yourself and sending this out to everyone every few weeks, you would actually have the confidence to obtain a girlfriend.\n  \n  seriously, stop spamming people with this nonsense. it's annoying af.\n  ","416810":"\n  i was late to work a few weeks ago -- only by like five minutes, thankfully.\n  ","416811":"\n  hell no, rofl. i find that so obnoxious.\n  ","416812":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","416813":"\n  depends on how much red is left over and what the other ombre color is. some colorists might be able to lift it all, while other times it can be a two-step process.\n  \n  the color you decide to go next is up to you. i'm coloring my hair blue and silver tomorrow.\n  ","416814":"\n  tomorrow, i'm shopping for gift bags & wrapping paper and getting my hair colored in the afternoon.\n  \n  sunday, i might be opening xmas gifts with my family. if not, then we're doing that on xmas eve.\n  \n  tuesday is xmas, so i'm spending it with my boyfriend's family.\n  \n  monday, wednesday, thursday, and friday, i'm going to work.\n  ","416815":"\n  no, i've never been fired before.\n  ","416816":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","416817":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n

","416822":"\n  that's interesting, i never thought about it that way before.\n  ","416823":"\n  i don't really see the point in having two cars unless you're fixing one up and using the other car for traveling.\n  ","416824":"\n  some people like to take their aggression out on others when they're stressed out in their lives.\n  ","416825":"\n  go right ahead !! lmao. i've only ever met like three cats that were easy to live with.\n  ","416826":"\n  i'd rather have two oversized dogs than six cats.\n  ","416827":"\n  LOL. we might as well at this point -- that's why when i'm looking up the definitions of words, i look them up from a variety of different sources because sometimes other sources take cultural significance into account while others don't.\n  ","416828":"\n  is it more reliable to base a definition on years of study in multiple disciplines or on a single sentence in a dictionary that likely hasn't been updated in decades ??\n  \n  there are a lot of words whose definitions have changed with time. that's just the way language naturally progresses.\n  ","416829":"\n  i disagree with them. that isn't what the cultural definition of what racism entails.\n  ","416830":"\n  i'm sitting on my bed, but that's the extent of it.\n  ","416831":"\n  LOL. yeah, it happens every now and again.\n  ","416832":"\n  ugh, my previous answer got deleted.\n  \n  either way, if you don't have anything valuable to add to this, then i'm going to delete your further messages. i already made my point clear.\n  ","416833":"\n  i answered a similar question earlier, but i'm just listening to music and answering questions rn.\n  \n  i'm happy that tomorrow is friday, at least. i've been so burnt out from work that it's going to feel nice to have a weekend.\n  ","416834":"\n  thanks, my dude ~~\n  ","416835":"\n  we're literally going around in circles, lmao.\n  \n  i'll repeat myself -- if a black person commits a crime against another person of color due to their race, then yes, that's racist.\n  \n  however, if a black person commits a crime against a white person, then no, that isn't racist. that's discriminatory.\n  \n  idk how to make it anymore clear than that. and i'm debating on not responding to you anymore because this is the same conversation over and over again, and you're not understanding.\n  ","416836":"\n  it's historical -- just because there's one incident where the justice system does the right thing doesn't mean that oppression doesn't exist anymore. regardless of what the law decides, oppression still exists and is defined by history (at least in this country). it's universal.\n  ","416837":"\n  ^^\n  ","416838":"\n  uh, yeah i can -- because oppression is based on years upon years of historical context. just because there are a few outcomes that are justifiable doesn't mean oppression doesn't exist anymore.\n  ","416839":"\n  i said the other day that i didn't know if i had a cold or not. regardless, i'm still feeling the same as i did yesterday or the day before, lol.\n  ","416840":"\n  my day was good, actually. i described it in more detail a few answers below, but basically my office had a secret santa gift exchange and it was a lot of fun.\n  \n  now i'm just listening to music and drinking hot cocoa. i'm also waiting to hear back from my friend to see if we're going out tonight.\n  ","416841":"\n  yeah. but a white person doesn't face oppression for being white so they don't experience racism.\n  \n  they can be discriminated against due to being white, but that isn't oppression.\n  ","416842":"\n  i don't really consider myself a member of any \"fandom,\" although i am a fan of a lot of different things. particularly, linkin park\/mike shinoda, harry potter, lord of the rings, certain video games, certain tv shows, etc etc.\n  \n  the only reason why i don't think i belong to their fandoms is because i'm not completely involved in maintaining connections with those fandoms. i call myself a fan of them, but i'm not part of the fandom.\n  ","416843":"\n  i honestly just don't think you're understanding where i'm coming from, which is understandable. sometimes things sound more logical in my head compared to when i try to write them down. i'm simply trying to make the distinction to you of the difference between racism and discrimination.\n  \n  ideally, those should be outcomes of both of those situations. however, it makes me wonder if the black person on trial would be given the death sentence as opposed to a life sentence because of the bias involved in the criminal justice system.\n  ","416844":"\n  i haven't watched any new movies at all -- however, i have started watching the innocent man on netflix, which is really good !!\n  \n  if any of you guys love true crime docuseries like making a murderer, then i highly suggest it.\n  ","416845":"\n  \"if you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n  ","416846":"\n  i don't see why families shouldn't be allowed to bring their children to public places like restaurants and movie theaters. children need to be exposed to the world and be given opportunities to be shown right vs wrong behavior.\n  ","416847":"\n  i don't anticipate it being much different than it is right now, besides the small goals i have set for myself come after the holidays. i've learned not to place expectations on my own life when so much of it is out of my own control.\n  ","416848":"\n  disloyalty -- whether that's in the form of extreme lying, cheating, etc etc. i don't tolerate any sort of relationship, platonic or romantic, where i can't trust the other person because they're not being loyal to me.\n  ","416849":"\n  the definition of words do change over time, and there's nothing wrong with that. while in the past it may have also applied to white people, but further studies into racism as a whole have revealed that it's a system of oppression, much like sexism. white people have never been oppressed due to their race, which is why they can't experience racism.\n  \n  obviously white people do face discrimination because of a number of things, race included, but the racism is fundamentally different than discrimination.\n  ","416850":"\n  i haven't received an advent calendar since i was a child. regardless, i remember the chocolate being hard and gross so i was never a fan of them to begin with, lmao.\n  ","416851":"\n  rose petals, gasoline, firewood, jasmine, patchouli, and the crisp scent of cold winter air.\n  ","416852":"\n  heathers, girl interrupted, and the crow.\n  ","416853":"\n  yes, i've attended several job interviews. i was offered the job with all of the interviews i went on, so it was just a matter of me choosing which job i wanted to go with.\n  ","416854":"\n  my day has been fun, actually !! we had a secret santa gift exchange at work during lunch today, so i got to see my person open his gift and i also got to open the gift someone else bought me.\n  \n  i got home not too long ago, and right now i'm just listening to music and drinking hot cocoa.\n  ","416855":"\n  i can eat cold pizza, but i don't really enjoy it. it's usually hangover food for me tbh, especially since i'm too lazy at that point to heat it in the microwave for a minute, lol.\n  \n  i've never tried cold mac n' cheese, but that sounds pretty gross.\n  ","416856":"\n  i didn't give an excuse to not do sports when i was in grade school, at least in terms of gym class. i always did whatever sports we were supposed to do for the 45 minutes we were in class.\n  ","416857":"\n  people of color may have equal rights as it pertains to written law, such as having voting rights, but often that isn't how the law is interpreted in court. there's a lot of bias in the justice system regarding people of color, particularly black people, and often people who commit the same crimes who are white end up getting lesser sentences.\n  \n  regarding your second statement, discrimination is favoring one thing (in this case race) over the other. racism, on the other hand, is a system of oppression based upon a person's race that basically isn't white.\n  ","416858":"\n  no, i only ever really use my phone when i get a notification from askfm, facebook, instagram, etc etc. i'm not generally sitting there scrolling through social media unless i have a lot of time to kill.\n  \n  in addition, i don't have cell phone service in my office building, so my phone is set to airplane mode for the majority of the day.\n  ","416859":"\n  i don't think i'm good looking or wise, so neither ??\n  \n  if i *had* to make a choice, i would probably say wise -- simply because i've been through some hardship and have learned valuable lessons from them. i don't think i'm an attractive person at all.\n  ","416860":"\n  yes, this year has gone incredibly fast !! i can't believe 2018 came and went already, and every time i try to think back on it, i can't really remember much of what has happened at all.\n  \n  i feel as if all i did was go to work, lmao. however, the fact that i've been at my job for more than a year now and it hasn't felt that long at all is probably a good thing.\n  ","416861":"\n  i used to enjoy watching national geographic documentaries, but i haven't sat down to watch one in years. i heard planet earth was a really wonderful docuseries, though.\n  ","416862":"\n  i don't know your friend, nor do i know you, so i have no clue if his messages even \"mean\" something at all. if he's not responding to you, he could simply be busy.\n  \n  if this is something that's bothering you, then ask him about it. you're not going to get anywhere by refusing to bring the issue up to him.\n  ","416863":"\n  that wouldn't coincide with racism because the law doesn't discriminate against white people based on their skin color (in fact, it often works in their favor), but it certainly is a breach of justice.\n  ","416864":"\n  i've had a few people come to me when they've been struggling, both online and in real life. how i comfort them depends entirely on their situation and how they currently feel, because those factors dictate what i say to them, how i say it, etc etc.\n  \n  generally speaking, i allow them to vent as much as they need to. i also encourage them to seek professional help in the form of therapy if that's something they agree that they should do in order to help sort out their issues. i encourage them to seek creative outlets, i.e. writing out their feelings, music, working out, etc etc. i also remind them that they've come this far and they can overcome anything they set their mind to.\n  ","416865":"\n  depends on whether or not you're civil with your ex. every circumstance is going to be different, but if you two are still on speaking terms, then it's probably better for the child to still celebrate holidays together.\n  ","416866":"\n  in my bed, haha. if this can even be considered a \"selfie.\"\n  ","416867":"\n  my boyfriend is the closest person to me who knows everything about me.\n  ","416868":"\n  i can't afford to care less about grammar, considering it's my job lol.\n  \n  outside of work, it isn't something that concerns me. however, it's extremely important to my job so i always make sure i'm aware of new changes.\n  ","416869":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","416870":"\n  aw thank you !!\n  ","416871":"\n  i worked at a drug store, so yeah.\n  ","416872":"\n  well i used to think tumblr was a great app, up until it flagged my blog as sensitive content and wouldn't let me change my icon or header. that has me really angry, actually.\n  ","416873":"\n  uh, right now it's cold and windy. otherwise, it's not affordable, taxes are too high, and people drive like assholes.\n  ","416874":"\n  not an artificial tan, no.\n  ","416875":"\n  i didn't pluck them before taking the photo.\n  ","416876":"\n  it's layered, i was just leaning my head down to show how long it is. the front is slightly longer than the back, though.\n  ","416877":"\n  i don't have any photos of myself with long hair, haha. this is the longest my hair has been in a long time.\n  ","416878":"\n  i don't have anyone blocked.\n  ","416879":"\n  good thing i don't live in romania then, lol.\n  ","416880":"\n  quite the contrary -- people can color their hair whatever they want regardless of their age.\n  ","416881":"\n  yeah, i think it's entirely possible that there are life forms on other planets in other solar systems that we haven't discovered yet.\n  ","416882":"\n  it varies, although lately i've been having absolutely no self control. it usually happens when i drink, though. i just don't know when to stop.\n  ","416883":"\n  i'm afraid somewhat of spiders, although it used to be a lot worse in the past. i usually just let my boyfriend take care of them.\n  ","416884":"\n  i suppose my eyes are my best physical attribute. it's what i like the most on myself.\n  ","416885":"\n  going to work tomorrow, lol. i've been so burnt out and it's been difficult for me to make it through the day.\n  ","416886":"\n  aw, there's

","416889":"\n  i don't do anything, i just wait for it to pass.\n  ","416890":"\n  i'm not sure. i've been somewhat congested with a stuffy nose, but that's the extent of my symptoms. it could simply be due to the drastic change in weather.\n  ","416891":"\n  my day was fine. i've just been tired all day & i've basically been laying down ever since i got home from work. i'm waiting for my boyfriend to call me back to see if we can see each other tonight.\n  ","416892":"\n  thanks for the follow ~~\n  \n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry.\n  ","416893":"\n  they did, but they never checked them with respect to me.\n  ","416894":"\n  all the time, haha. i've been so burnt out lately. i'm looking forward to next weekend because it's a four-day weekend for me & i desperately need it.\n  ","416895":"\n  they're both painful, and it would be unfair to try to compare them to see which is the \"harder\" struggle. hardships aren't a competition.\n  ","416896":"\n  i know

one else was around.\n  ","416899":"\n  i never got caught, lol. if i did, i would have been fired. i stole them because they were expensive and i didn't feel like laying the money out for them -- however, i would only do it every once in a while, not every time i needed a pack.\n  \n  and no, there were no discounts on cigarettes.\n  ","416900":"\n  i used to shop lift when i worked in retail.

","416920":"\n  that's really difficult to really process because honestly, i don't know how i would feel about that either. depending on the relationship, there sometimes needs to be at least some level of physical attraction -- however, there are also some people who don't place any value in physical attraction at all and only base their attraction solely on personality.\n  \n  if you're

in your brain which relate to levels of serotonin, dopamine, etc etc. mood stabilizers target specific molecules, from my understanding, that aid in the stabilization of severe mood swings.\n  \n  it takes 1-2 weeks for most psychiatric medications to begin working, including mood stabilizers. personally speaking, i'm on a mood stabilizer, antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and antipsychotic. they all target different symptoms that i experience, so as a result, my moods are significantly less severe, my depressions aren't as low, my anxiety isn't terrible, i rarely experience panic attacks, and my paranoia has diminished greatly.\n  \n  you can't become dependent on medications that aren't narcotics. if you ever want to stop taking them, you can simply wean off of them with the guidance of your doctor and you won't experience any negative side effects.\n  ","416928":"\n  hopefully he doesn't check my page and read this, LOL. i've been hesitant to post what i bought for him because i don't

such as to hurt other people, then i would consider them an overall bad person. however, if your intentions are good at heart and you want to help others -- even if that help may be misguided -- then i would still consider you a good person.\n  \n  there are also a lot of gray areas to take into account because life isn't simply black and white, good and bad, etc etc. someone may simultaneously

diagnostic criteria for BPD includes self-destructive behavior as well as svicidal ideation, so that's why people the statistics are so high with BPD in particular.\n  ","416989":"\n  i'm not too

mental disorders like BPD have an extremely high mortality rate, like i was stating earlier. that risk increases the longer a person goes without treatment due to the shocking prevalence of self destructive behaviors and svicidal ideation.\n  \n  so no, it isn't dramatic. rather, it's realistic. if i didn't get treatment for my mental illnesses, i would have died as well.\n  \n  cc:\n  \n

is that mental disorders are a combination of chemical imbalances and behavioral traits that arise out of genetics or environmental causes.\n  ","416993":"\n  this is going to sound cliche, but love cannot be bought for money. you cannot buy a person's love, and your sh*tty behavior cannot be redeemed by showering the person you've hurt with gifts or anything else with monetary value behind it.\n  \n  in the same vein, you shouldn't feel the need to buy something for someone in order to \"prove\" your love. ideally, love itself should be enough and the way you express your love should be enough, especially if you can't afford to give your partner gifts.\n  ","416994":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree with you. thankfully i've never come across that \"side\" of tumblr before, but i've seen dozens of posts about it and which blogs to avoid, etc etc., and i'm really happy that tumblr took this initiative.\n  ","416995":"\n  being sxxually abvsive is a different mindset than being physically or verbally abvsive because in the case of sxxual abvse, you're literally attracted to children, and that's something that's incredibly difficult to change -- if it can even be changed at all. in rare cases, sxxual abvsers may be able to look back on their behavior and realize it was wrong and want to change, but that doesn't change their attraction.\n  ","416996":"\n  BPD is one of the most misunderstood personality disorders, although nearly all of them are stigmatized to a degree (especially ASPD). however, BPD ranges in severity, much like most other mental illnesses -- and it's also one with the highest mortality rates.\n  \n  idk why it's stigmatized to begin with, probably because those who are diagnosed with BPD or suspected of having BPD are deemed to be \"manipulative\" in light of their self destructive tendencies, but it only hurts the survivor even more in the long run.\n  ","416997":"\n  i don't think abvse is a competition -- regardless of whether it's physical, verbal, or sxxual abvse, it's still abvse and deserves punishment through imprisonment.\n  \n  whether or not something is forgivable, that's entirely up to the survivor. there's no right or wrong way for a survivor to learn how to effectively cope with their abvse, and some survivors choose to forgive their abvsers while others don't -- and that's perfectly okay. every case of abvse is individualized and unique, which is why it's impossible to really say that *all* abvsers can be forgiven or can be changed.\n  ","416998":"\n  anyone have any questions ?? my

participate. the last time it happened was a few months ago, i was at starbucks and the person in front of me paid for my coffee and sandwich, so i paid for the meal of the person behind me.\n

p*rnography on tumblr, then that's a movement i'm 100 percent behind.\n  ","417058":"\n  personally, yes. if my therapist & psychiatrist were that expensive, then i wouldn't have gone to see them because i don't have that sort of money on hand.\n  \n  that's why i've always looked around for doctors who take my insurance, my co-pays are significantly less expensive than that.\n  ","417059":"\n

question ??\n  ","417077":"\n  you sending this to multiple people doesn't make you very credible.\n  ","417078":"\n  sometimes you have to question your trust for people who are wrong. i was raised

about this to me.\n  ","417084":"\n  idk why you're complaining about this to me -- i don't fit that criteria.\n  \n  but there are a lot of racist people where i live, so i feel you. anyone who claims that racism doesn't exist anymore is disillusioned.\n  ","417085":"\n  take care of yourself first and foremost -- your happiness doesn't mean less than other people's happiness, and you're deserving of love and compassion just like anyone else in your life. you shouldn't have to put yourself down if it means putting others first because that's toxic and unhealthy.\n  ","417086":"\n  my

on it for weeks -- there's really no in between. it depends entirely on what or who upset me, though, as well as my mood at that current moment.\n  ","417092":"\n  no, i don't. i can focus on things for a long time, which is helpful for my job because it requires me to be attentive and focused for long periods of time. there's little room for mistakes so i can't afford to have a short attention span.\n  ","417093":"\n  no, i never cheated because i didn't want to be thrown out of class or out of school completely. that goes for both high school and college. my education was too important to me to throw it away because of something as useless and unreliable as cheating.\n  ","417094":"\n  i used to prefer reading, but these days, i would rather watch the movie. i haven't really been in the mood to sit down with a book and read lately, even though i have dozens of books just waiting for me to crack open their pages.\n  ","417095":"\n  when i was in school, i seldom studied -- it was always easy for me to retain material through listening in class and taking notes, and often i would rewrite my notes when i was on a break or at home to make them more organized, which led to further understanding of the material.\n  \n  i never really completed assignments last minute, though. if there was one thing college taught me, it was to do assignments as soon as possible because you don't know when things would pile up and become overwhelming. it also made me feel a lot better when i got assignments done early.\n  ","417096":"\n  i prefer learning in a classroom, although admittedly i've never taken online classes before so i honestly don't know how i would do with learning at home.\n  \n  i think i would get too distracted at home, though. when i'm in a classroom, i'm there for the intended purpose and it's easier to get into the mindset of education when you're in that sort of environment.\n  ","417097":"\n  my day has been good so far -- it's not even 11am, so i haven't done much at all. i woke up at 9am at my boyfriend's house, went to starbucks on the way home, and i've been bullsh*tting on my laptop on tumblr & askfm since then.\n  \n  i'm probably going to turn my laptop off and play some fallout 4 soon if i don't get many questions, and then later, i'm going to be getting ready to go to a work holiday party tonight.\n  ","417098":"\n  oh, awkward.\n  ","417099":"\n  that would upset me a lot because it means they're not respecting your feelings. if you told them that something they're doing is hurting you, then ideally they should try their best to stop that behavior out of respect for you.\n  \n  this is really vague though, and it ultimately depends on the specific circumstance. also if she's cognizant of whether or not she's actually doing that behavior. sometimes people aren't aware of their actions and need a hard reality check before they understand the implications of their actions.\n  ","417100":"\n  (cont) myself from that movement, and began looking at people and the world with a more open approach, you were one of the things that made me realize that back then, I really just followed the crowd without any sole reason for my beliefs. today, even though I may disagree with some things you say, I'm not...\n  \n  --\n  \n  uhh, was there supposed to be a third part to this statement ??\n  \n  tbh i'm confused because you just sent the same thing to\n  \n   @mellifluousvixen\n  \n  . so idk if you actually mean this or you just think the same thing regarding the two of us and figured it would be easier to copy\/paste the message.\n  \n  if you're genuine in this, then thank you so much !! that means a lot to me. :'))\n  ","417101":"\n  i don't think so, no. i don't really have much in common with his exes.\n  ","417102":"\n  i don't have much money to give away, lol. we'll buy things for each other out of courtesy if we're already out, but that's the extent of it. most of the time, he brushes my hand away if we're together and i offer to pay for something.\n  ","417103":"\n  i said that i don't know what he's doing with me -- he has the option of seeing virtually anyone else, but instead he chooses to be with me. totally mind boggling.\n  ","417104":"\n  i was extremely svicidal when i was a teenager & attempted to take my life a few times. i didn't think i would live long enough to graduate from college, let alone see the age of 27.\n  ","417105":"\n  i don't have one, considering i didn't think i would live this long to begin with, lmao.\n  ","417106":"\n  just support them in their endeavors -- if they express uncertainty about something, remind them of how valuable they are and capable of doing anything they set their mind to, and remind them of their successes in the past.\n  \n  it's difficult to really help people who have low self esteem because the problem comes from within, and it's mostly a solitary journey. people gain self esteem over time with confidence and self-actualization, but it helps when you have friends\/family\/etc. to support you along the way and recognize your true nature and potential.\n  ","417107":"\n  i've always wanted to take a spontaneous flight out of the airport to a location picked at random and spend a few days wherever i am and experiencing what the location has to offer me.\n  \n  it just seems so alluring and interesting, the unexpectedness of it all. obviously i would have someone with me & i wouldn't go alone, though.\n  ","417108":"\n  everyone's formula for happiness is different depending on what they like & what makes them most comfortable.\n  \n  for me personally, my formula for happiness includes my boyfriend, coffee, video games or a true crime docuseries, cigarettes, and lots of candles and snuggling. any nights where we can light a candle, drink coffee, and play video games together is a fantastic night imo.\n  ","417109":"\n  i don't personally believe the moon landing was a hoax, but the conspiracy theories behind why people believe it never happened are really interesting tbh.\n  ","417110":"\n  i'm terrified of abandonment by my loved ones -- particularly my boyfriend and close friends. i'm afraid they're going to get fed up with me and leave me one day without warning.\n  ","417111":"\n  yes, i'm waiting on a package from etsy -- i ordered my boyfriend a shirt that has a bearded dragon on it & says \"proud dragon dad\" for xmas. it should be here by next week, so i'm not worried.\n  ","417112":"\n  yeah, they're 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.\n  ","417113":"\n  i did actually -- my mother has always told me that she's german & irish, but i guess the irish percentage is small compared to everything else i am.\n  ","417114":"\n  honestly, not a clue !! i ask myself the same question on a regular basis.\n  ","417115":"\n  new york.\n  ","417116":"\n  actually, he's really attractive to most people too, lol. the amount of times he gets flirted with at work is unreal.\n  ","417117":"\n  average height, slim but with toned muscles, sharp jawline and cheekbones, beard and mustache, and short black hair on top. wears glasses.\n  ","417118":"\n  no, but diabetes does run in my family.\n  ","417119":"\n  he's pretty damn attractive.\n  ","417120":"\n  only when i'm alone or around my boyfriend, lmao. it's a good way to break up a bout of silence.

condition, then i just throw them out.\n  ","417124":"\n  once every few months or so. i haven't had a reason to thoroughly clean everything out lately, though, so it's been a while since i've last thrown out and organized my things.\n  ","417125":"\n  ask me questions, friends ~~\n  \n  i'm bored & will answer nearly anything. except sxxual questions. those will be deleted.

everything works out !!\n  ","417127":"\n  no, not that i'm aware of LOL. my family installed one of those \"smart\" door bells with the camera inside of it, though, so if it ever did happen then we would have a clear shot of the person.\n  ","417128":"\n  thankfully this hasn't happened to me before. how long has it been since you first contacted them ?? if they don't get back to you by

only once when i was very sleep deprived when i was a teenager. i don't have hallucinations regularly.\n  ","417145":"\n  i don't have synesthesia, so this doesn't pertain to me.\n  ","417146":"\n  experiencing depersonalization (also known as dissociation) isn't a voluntary experience. it's often a side effect of severe trauma and can happen to a person if they become triggered.\n  \n  i experience dissociation often, unfortunately. obviously it isn't a voluntary coping mechanism, but it does happen to me when i'm triggered by something in my life, or sometimes for no reason whatsoever.\n  ","417147":"\n  no, i've always been a patient person as far as i'm aware. the only times i'm impatient are when i'm running late to something and believe that i *can* make it on time if i rush around.\n  ","417148":"\n  i get paid hourly too & i have a degree in communications, which is the field i'm currently employed in. i've actually never held a salaried job ; even my last job prior to this one at the law firm was an hourly wage.\n  ","417149":"\n  idk if it's technically considered cultural appropriation or not, but my boyfriend and i dressed up as sugar skulls once many years ago & the makeup came out amazing. he has this old sombrero from cuba that he ended up wearing, so it pulled the look in perfectly.\n  ","417150":"\n  preachhh, girllll.\n  \n  sorta along the same lines, but just because you have a college education doesn't guarantee that you'll get a good job or that all jobs are automatically \"better\" than jobs you can get without a degree. going back to my best friend who's a store manager -- she earns a salary, i don't. she earns more than i do, and she doesn't have a college education.\n  \n  things aren't always cut and dry like society wants you to believe. it's unfortunately drilled into our skulls that we *must* get a college education or else we won't go far in life, but that couldn't be further from the truth. there are so many different paths a person can take.\n  ","417151":"\n  no, i'm pretty much guaranteed to be terrible at all sports. i tried skateboarding and snowboarding when i was a teenager & it was not a good time.\n  ","417152":"\n  i haven't been to the library since high school. the last book i checked out of the library was never returned, so i've always been terrified to step foot back into that library, LOL.\n  \n  i still have the book, believe it or not.\n  ","417153":"\n  i agree. as long as you're doing what you need to do to keep afloat in your life and you're happy with what you're doing, then it shouldn't matter what it is (within reason, obviously). all jobs are necessary in the long run.\n  ","417154":"\n  according to my 23andme results, i'm 24% german, 20% italian, 15%

really. i used to drink it in my green tea, but i stopped liking the taste of it.\n  ","417157":"\n  honestly, i'll never understand these anons' obsession with your life (or anyone's life in general). it makes me wonder how horribly insecure they are about their own lives, education, job prospects, families, etc etc. obviously their acting out means something, and it usually stems from the fact that they're unhappy about their own lives -- so they take that aggression out on other people.\n  \n  at this point, i would have thought they'd have given up. it's been literally years, lol.\n  ","417158":"\n  i have a fickle relationship with food, so i never binge eat at all if i can't help it. i only eat until i'm not hungry anymore in small portions, and i've been trying to eat less often (perhaps 2-3 times per day).\n  \n  however ... last night, my boyfriend & i binged on a cheese and salami platter, which was hella delicious. lmao.\n  ","417159":"\n  LOL. this is so true.\n  \n  also, i just realized -- you don't need a degree to earn a salary if you work in retail, either. i just remembered that my best friend is a store manager of a retail store & she gets paid a salary, but she doesn't have a degree at all. it's all about experience.\n  ","417160":"\n  lol, not at all. i'm absolutely horrid at singing.\n  \n  if i had a good voice, i would have gone into the music industry.\n  ","417161":"\n  you can't trust anyone in the media tbh. every news outlet reports their stories with a particular bias, which is why it's hella important to gather your data from multiple sources.\n  ","417162":"\n  there's nothing wrong with hourly waged jobs -- most jobs these days are paid hourly, unless you work for a corporation and have at least a bachelor's degree, but even so, not all corporations pay their employees a salary either.\n  \n  sometimes a salary can be a bad thing, which is the way i've always rationalized it to myself -- even though you're guaranteed x amount of dollars per week, that also means that you won't get paid any extra for overtime. if you're paid on an hourly basis, you get paid extra if you go over 40 hours per week.\n  ","417163":"\n  legend of zelda, if that counts as old school.\n  ","417164":"\n  i don't listen to any podcasts, although sometimes i'll put the rooster teeth podcast on in the background while i'm doing something else.\n  ","417165":"\n  spanish or russian.\n  ","417166":"\n  no, it's something i'm fairly used to at this point.\n  ","417167":"\n  i'd rather live in the mountains. i prefer cold weather over hot weather, and even though i currently live 20 minutes from the beach, i never go there.\n  ","417168":"\n  i started to watch it a year or two ago, but the first few episodes were really slow and i couldn't get into it.\n  ","417169":"\n  i'm all right, just tired. my boyfriend and i stayed up late last night and i'm sorta regretting it, rofl. but we haven't seen each other since last week so we needed the quality time together.\n  ","417170":"\n  i've never heard it before & i don't feel like looking it up.\n  ","417171":"\n  sometimes i think it's a bit terrifying how desensitized society as a whole is to catastrophic events, i.e. war, mass shootings, bomb threats, etc etc. they happen so often these days that when we hear of another mass shooting, we feel upset temporarily, but then we move on because there's nothing we can realistically do. it doesn't shock or halt the nation anymore on an overall scale. the news media reports on it for a few days, and then they're on to the next topic.\n  \n  that includes myself as well. today, there was an email chain sent out to thousands of schools & corporations saying that there was a bomb in the building and to pay someone in bitcoin so that it won't detonate. my company didn't receive the email itself, but we did receive a warning from HR saying what it was, and i read it for two minutes, shook my head, and deleted the email. that's a bit scary to me.\n  ","417172":"\n  everything that i'm angry or upset about is irrational & stupid, so ranting about them would just feed into my mindset that they're important issues when they're really not, lmao.\n  \n  i've been in a fairly good mood these days despite that, so i don't really have anything substantial to rant about. if y'all give me a topic, though, i'll gladly voice my opinion ~~\n  ","417173":"\n  that's a pessimistic means of looking at birthdays. to most people, celebrating birthdays means that you're celebrating the fact that you

to judge a person based on something that isn't one of their strengths and make an overall judgment on that person because of that one facet of who they are. just because someone isn't good at one specific thing doesn't mean that they're not excellent at other things, and to judge a person wholly on that one area is doing them a disservice.\n  \n  i also relate this to standardized tests -- standardized testing is an overall means of determining \"intelligence\" that only targets specific types of intelligence, and students who don't do well on standardized testing may believe that they're not intelligent, even if their intelligence lies in a completely different area.\n  ","417175":"\n  \"cut the crap\" basically means that you want the person you're talking to, to stop lying or making excuses & own up to the truth.\n  \n  i.e. if someone is lying to you straight to your face when you know the truth of the situation, you can tell them \"cut the crap\" as a slangy way of telling them to stop lying.\n  ","417176":"\n  i'm doing fine. i feel a lot better than i did yesterday (yesterday i was home sick with stomach issues and a bad cold). i still have congestion & i'm

getting there because the venue is about 40 minutes away, and my only option is to take an uber there & i've never taken an uber that far before.\n  \n  but once i get there, i think i'll be fine. it

december 13th.\n  \n  however, i'm looking forward to giving my boyfriend the xmas gifts i bought him -- i got quite a few more things in the mail today, and i'm so so excited to see what he thinks of them !!\n  ","417182":"\n  parents are responsible for setting a good example for their children and teaching them right vs. wrong from an early age. the way you behave as a parent or adult reflects entirely on your child, and they'll learn from your ways in some form or another. if a child misbehaves, then often it's a reflection of either the way the child was raised or what they witnessed growing up, and that is partially the parents' fault. acting out at a very young age is an indication of an unhappy home life.\n  \n  however, when the child gets older, the blame does shift from the parents more onto the individual child -- i would say teenage years would be around the time that the teenager's actions don't necessarily reflect the way they're raised, although there is still a

people with mental illness.\n  \n  prior to starting treatment for my mental illnesses, i worked in retail for four years and in a stressful office environment for two years (the last year of that, though, i had just begun treatment). i consistently climbed the ranks and was looked upon by my bosses as an excellent worker, and although i may have called out of work due to panic attacks and depression, the work i put in when i was there was twice as much as what most other people did during the workday.\n  \n  everyone is different, but the idea that being mentally ill means you're not a productive member of society is inherently false and toxic.\n  ","417246":"\n  idk if i even want kids in the first place, lol.\n  \n  while BPD might be genetic, it's also influenced by environmental factors which change the function of the amygdala and how someone perceives and reacts situations. if i have children in the future, i sure as hell won't raise them in the environment in which i was

receive unless you have a condition that meets a listing or you have substantial medical evidence, it's such a small percentage of people who actually win their cases.\n  ","417250":"\n  possibly, but it's uncertain because even master's degrees are taken less seriously these days.\n  \n  personally speaking, i wouldn't know what to major in anyway. i have so many varying interests that it wouldn't make sense for me to waste money on an education that isn't necessary for me and that i wouldn't know which direction i should take.\n  ","417251":"\n  you're exactly right. the timeline to obtain disability benefits can take up to 3-4 years depending on which circuit you're in. that's assuming you were denied upon the initial application stage and had to wait for a hearing.\n  \n  even so, the supplemental income is so low that its exactly what it sounds like -- supplemental. often those who receive disability benefits also are on medicare, food stamps, etc etc.\n  ","417252":"\n  i'm not disabled & i'm fully capable of working.\n  ","417253":"\n  racism is systemic oppression that has plagued communities like the black community for centuries. even if a black person is wealthy, that doesn't mean they can't experience racism.\n  ","417254":"\n  that's not true at all. there are millions of people who have mental illness and are able to succeed in a work environment.\n  \n  when i was untreated, i called out of work often. however, since i've been in treatment and have made progress with my mental health, i rarely call out of work. that doesn't mean my mental illnesses miraculously disappeared, though. i just learned to handle them better with the help of therapy and medication.\n  \n  in addition, the technical definition of disability, in legal terms, is a physical or mental condition that precludes you from sustaining work activity. if someone is disabled due to mental illness, then yeah -- they won't be able to work. that's when disability benefits come into play.\n  ","417255":"\n  it's not a matter of who, it's a matter of people being treated equally regardless of their circumstance or otherwise something about them that they don't control, like their race or sex or gender or orientation or mental\/physical illness.\n  \n  those who have been oppressed by society in general don't deserve the stigma and violence faced against them. that isn't something a specific person decides, it's just the way things are.\n  ","417256":"\n  inequality is bad because it puts people in positions that are undeserving, especially when it comes to those who have already struggled with oppression for centuries.\n  \n  ideally, we all should be treated equally regardless of race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc etc.\n  ","417257":"\n  ???\n  \n  this is a dumb question, lmao.\n  ","417258":"\n  laws & legislation, and individual cases of severe violence. i'm not going to go into specific cases or examples because it's something you can easily look up on your own.\n  ","417259":"\n  i'm usually distracting myself from racing\/impulsive thoughts & svicidal ideation.\n  ","417260":"\n  yes, it does.\n  ","417261":"\n  most of the time, yeah. if i'm not distracting myself through seeing my boyfriend or friends, then i'm mindlessly scrolling through social media, playing video games, or watching television.\n  ","417262":"\n  i don't really know what you mean by \"those who do it tough.\"\n  ","417263":"\n  i wouldn't be surprised if it was. the rich are getting richer & the poor are getting poorer.\n  ","417264":"\n  i'm certain they actually believe it. all of the racist\/sexist\/homophobic\/transphobic\/ableist people i've come across actually believe that people are inferior to them or weaker individuals because they're a different race, sex, sexuality, or gender than them. there are people out there who genuinely believe that those with physical or mental disabilities aren't deserving of equal compassion or understanding.\n  ","417265":"\n  i think most areas in general, but like i said, it all depends on your perspective. things like racism, women's rights, lgbt rights, and mental health awareness are shedding more light and becoming better, but at the same time, there is also injustice related to all of them due to various stigmas, systems of oppression, and cases of violence.\n  ","417266":"\n  they were likely raised in an environment that was racist and adopted those views around them.\n  ","417267":"\n  depends on what kind of inequality you're talking about, and which perspective you look at it from. in some areas, inequality is more prevalent, but in other areas, it's getting better.\n  \n  i.e. racism in america. obviously things are a lot better than they were 50 years ago, but there has still been so much injustice, racism, and inequality the past 5-10 years that it's impossible to overlook. there's still a hell of a lot of racism in today's society.\n  ","417268":"\n  depends on experience & what opportunities are presented to you. sometimes it's easy to make money, but you aren't making *enough* money, which is why a lot of people have 2+ jobs.\n  ","417269":"\n  you asked me this once before and i told you that cheating on tests is never a good idea, especially in college. you can get thrown out -- if you plagiarize something in college, they can expel you from school.\n  ","417270":"\n  i'm pretty content atm !! i'm drinking tea & watching true crime documentaries on netflix. :'))\n  ","417271":"\n  i'd rather do neither.

surprisingly, no. i've never been interested in gambling so i've never had a reason to go.\n  ","417280":"\n  yeah, you can get thrown out of casinos if they catch you counting cards.\n  ","417281":"\n  haha, no. i've also never tried before. i'm fairly certain my boyfriend is able to do it though.\n  ","417282":"\n  i'm not going into detail regarding my svicide attempts.\n  ","417283":"\n  i don't think it has anything to do with ego. i think people (not just women) desire to have children because they want a family to call their own and feel love for something that isn't their significant other.\n  \n  that's what i assume, at least. i don't know if i want children or not so that's simply a guess on my end.\n  ","417284":"\n  the way you described that could be offensive for some, so you shouldn't refer to svicide in that way anymore (just fyi).\n  \n  what initially stopped me was that i failed at completing svicide, to be perfectly honest. i tried twice when i was a teenager. but if my friend wasn't there to talk to me and support me, i would have kept trying until i succeeded.\n  ","417285":"\n  occasionally !! we have each other on facebook, so we talk every month or so just to catch up on each other's lives.\n  ","417286":"\n  she's a woman and she's three years older than me. we actually met on a fan forum dedicated to linkin park, lol.\n  ","417287":"\n  i only met one of them in person, and it happened after five years of talking to them on a daily basis.\n  \n  i was visiting colleges, and they happened to live an hour or two away

the internet.\n  \n  it sounds incredibly lame, but when i was a teenager, the friends i made through the internet saved my life. if it wasn't for them, then i would have probably succeeded in svicide when i was 14 and 16. they gave me hope and consolation when things were really bad, as well as an outlet to express my feelings when i had nowhere else to turn.\n  ","417289":"\n  i have a double

talk sometimes !!\n  ","417297":"\n  i'm sure that happens to some people, sure. for the most part, though, i believe people have the ability to retain their empathy, which partly makes it difficult to live in our society because it's hard to become desensitized to certain things.\n  ","417298":"\n  for the most part, yes. i'm always willing to learn new things and i like educating myself on various subjects in my spare time, when i have the opportunity to do so.\n  ","417299":"\n  oatmeal or yogurt in the mornings, a sandwich with cold cuts or steamed broccoli and grilled chicken for

care from afar -- that's entirely different from not giving a sh*t at all.\n  ","417309":"\n  i get two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch.\n  ","417310":"\n  nothing specific happened. it's just what

else.\n  ","417321":"\n  that only happens to me when i'm extremely depressed and can't find the motivation or energy to get out of bed. those days, i stay in bed all day with the door closed, and i end up sleeping for 12+ hours.\n  ","417322":"\n  not that far at all -- i'm generally really spontaneous and impulsive when it comes to plans & i take each day as it comes.\n  ","417323":"\n  send me questions y'all, my inbox is empty ~~\n  ","417324":"\n  no, actually. however, there was one time my boyfriend and his friend were leaning on what is technically considered my neighbor's fence when

neighbor is an extremely grumpy old man so my boyfriend and his friend were like OH SHIT when it broke. i don't remember if they ended up paying for it to get replaced, though. this happened at least

don't personally know. i've also been in a relationship with the same person for a long time.\n  ","417331":"\n  everyone is different. studies show that sex increases the emotional intimacy you feel for a person which can lead to feelings of love for that person.\n  \n  obviously not everyone reacts the same way to sex and a lot of people can compartmentalize sex and love, which makes it easier to have casual sex.\n  ","417332":"\n  OH LOL.\n  \n  it was a frame from facebook. i didn't type it myself.\n  ","417333":"\n  i don't believe i have recently, but it was probably a typo.\n

two days doing chores around the house, playing video games, and doing laundry. i didn't have any errands to run besides getting gas for my car last night, and i saw my friend last night for a few hours which was nice.\n  ","417339":"\n  only on the weekends, the rest of the days i go to work in the morning.\n  ","417340":"\n  when i'm not with my boyfriend, pretty much all the time, lol. especially in the mornings when i'm drinking my cup of coffee. i think that's why i like waking up early on the weekends, no one is awake so nobody can bother me.\n  ","417341":"\n  thanks !! you're a bit early, but i'll keep this in mind when i turn 39.\n  ","417342":"\n  no ?? i literally never do that to actual questions.\n  \n  fyi this is askfm's QOTD. it isn't an actual question someone asked me, lol.\n  ","417343":"\n  i just took a good ass nap, and now i'm drinking coffee & listening to music.\n  \n  y'all should ask me some questions in the meantime ~~\n  ","417344":"\n  no, i don't think i do, rofl. i don't think i use my pinkie fingers or my ring fingers that often.\n  ","417345":"\n  yeah, unless i'm going through a depressive episode. then i can't find the energy to shower or leave my house at all.\n  ","417346":"\n  i'm in treatment for my mental illnesses, and i see both a psychiatrist and therapist. i've been on medication for about two years now, which helps a lot. if you're depressed, then perhaps you should try to talk to a professional about it if you're able to do so.\n  \n  it's currently 10:15am where i live.\n  ","417347":"\n  what's holding you back from getting a job ?? if you think that's the best thing for you, you should at least try to put a few applications in and see what happens.\n  \n  i'm sorry you're feeling depressed. i'm diagnosed with depression so i understand the feeling all too well.\n  ","417348":"\n  i don't know if i would necessarily break up with them immediately, but i would definitely have an issue with a relationship if my significant other started using their mental health issues as an excuse to be manipulative, cruel, or vindictive.\n  \n  like i stated in my previous answer, i believe people have the capability to change. but if my significant other doesn't believe that their behavior is wrong, and they're not receptive to conversations regarding the topic, then i may consider breaking up with them. especially if they start being cruel or manipulative towards me.\n  ","417349":"\n  i'm not entirely sure. for the most part, empathy is an innate trait from my experience, and if someone doesn't experience empathy, they're usually so disconnected from that emotion (and usually for such a long time) that it seems impossible to develop a sense of empathy.\n  \n  at the same time, however, i also believe people can change if they recognize their behavior or feelings are toxic, problematic, hurtful, etc etc., and take the necessary steps to resolve their problems and actively work toward being a better person.\n  ","417350":"\n  i wish i wasn't mentally ill sometimes. my anxiety prevents me from doing ordinary, daily tasks sometimes, which puts strain on my relationships with my family and friends because sometimes i'm too anxious to even leave my house because of my fear of driving.\n  \n  in regards to BPD, my mood swings are exhausting and vary within a matter of minutes to hours, and they're never consistent. they've gotten remarkably better since i started taking a mood stabilizer, but it still exists to a degree. in addition, i'm also extremely sensitive to what people say to me, especially my loved ones, and i automatically assume they hate me if they express even a hint of disappointment or disagreement with me.\n  ","417351":"\n  i've ... never thought about this before. LOL.\n  \n  it's interesting because other planets' moons have actual names, but the earth's moon is just called moon. which sounds so ridiculously dumb.\n  ","417352":"\n  i'm not the biggest fan of xmas, so i don't really have any essential things to do or items to decorate, etc etc.\n  \n  i think the only thing i do consistently every year, though, is buy an ugly xmas sweater, LOL. i bought an xmas files xmas sweater this year, so i hope it delivers in time for the sweater contest at my job in a few weeks.\n  ","417353":"\n  i just use standard xmas wrapping paper, usually the cheapest paper i can find in the drug store or 99 cent store because wrapping paper is ridiculously expensive.\n  \n  i think this year, though, i might use gift bags for most of my gifts since i can always reuse them next year.\n  ","417354":"\n  i don't know anyone who faked their death, no. if they did, then they must have fooled me because as far as i know, everyone i know who has passed has stayed dead, haha.\n  ","417355":"\n  i have about 90 percent of my xmas shopping done !! i'm just waiting for the rest of my gifts to come in the mail since i did primarily online shopping this year.\n  \n  i still have to get my brother another gift, as well as my aunt because i only bought them small things and it doesn't feel like enough.\n  ","417356":"\n  i'm sorry you went through this, friend. it's difficult when a parent berates you like that because they're supposed to look out for you and advocate for you, not belittle you and alienate you.\n  \n  i've been in this position many times myself, but it ultimately depends on the situation and the existing relationship you already have with your father. if you're able to sit down with him and tell him that his words were hurtful, then perhaps you should try that and see what he says.\n  ","417357":"\n  i don't feel very ambitious. i might do laundry and a bit of cleaning, but those are things that *need* to get done, not things i necessarily *want* to do, lol.\n  ","417358":"\n  i've been in love with matt maeson lately !!\n  \n  this song is called \"put it on me\" ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/-hcAI0g-f5M\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","417359":"\n  drunk me doesn't experience anxiety, is confident in who they are, is happy (most of the time), and knows how to have a conversation without any doubts or worries.\n  \n  sober me is basically ... the opposite of that, lol. when i'm sober, i tend to get anxious a lot, i'm not confident in who i am, i'm not happy (although sometimes i'm pretty content), and sometimes i don't know what to say in social situations.\n  ","417360":"\n  probably not. i don't have the time or energy to teach someone english.\n  ","417361":"\n  i've had the same best friend for 15 years, lol.\n  ","417362":"\n  no, i've only been on SSRIs and SNRIs.\n  ","417363":"\n  i've honestly never tried, rofl. i've never been pulled over or questioned while I was drunk.\n  ","417364":"\n  i prefer using it on the computer, but i usually use it on my phone.\n  ","417365":"\n  no, it's just leigh.\n  ","417366":"\n  no, not that i'm aware of.\n  ","417367":"\n  i think it's smart. there are a lot of p*dophiles out there and i don't personally think i would post pictures of my kids if i had any.\n  ","417368":"\n  \"you say\" by two feet. i have their spotify station on.\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/GHYLePbkWaY\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","417369":"\n  idc. if you want more vodka, then have someone else pick it up for you.\n  ","417370":"\n  i'm not interested in watching a movie rn. i'm listening to music.\n  ","417371":"\n  ???\n  \n  drunk driving is a serious matter and i don't know you or your alcohol level rn. if she thinks you're not okay to drive, then don't risk driving. it isn't worth the consequences.\n  ","417372":"\n  no, i've never heard of it before now.\n  ","417373":"\n  redd's wicked black cherry.\n  \n  it's like ... a malt beverage, i think ?? all i know is that it's 8 percent alcohol so i figured i'd try it. it's pretty yummy.\n  ","417374":"\n  ???\n  \n  idk if she would like you sending this out without her knowledge, but i consider tal a good friend and i'm so so so proud of her right now. i'm not going to sit here and claim i know what it's like to have an eating disorder because i've never dealt with it myself, but i do understand addiction and now difficult it is to deal with, especially in terms of relapse.\n  \n  tal, ily. you can beat this and you're one of the strongest people i know.\n  ","417375":"\n  so i'm drinking & rocking out to some music.\n  \n  ask me questions, friends ~~\n  ","417376":"\n  it literally disgusts me -- black people have struggled with racism for ages and for a non-black person to pretend to be black is basically a slap to the face, because they've never dealt with the oppression black people have faced and its the ultimate definition of privilege.\n  \n  if you're not black, then you can't try to adopt black culture. also not to mention that blackface is one of the most racist things you can do.\n  ","417377":"\n  no, i use the free version.\n  ","417378":"\n  it's relatively new and pretty glitchy, lol. it's cute though.\n  ","417379":"\n  they're different apps and such.\n  \n  my last profile picture was from the xbox avatar creator, but i've also used bitmoji and zepeto.\n  ","417380":"\n  i like my passion and knowledge about mental health advocacy the most.\n  \n  i dislike ... basically everything else.\n  ","417381":"\n  i don't know much about her other than the fact that she played hannah montana and is a recording artist now.\n  ","417382":"\n  i've only heard it just now, and i just briefly read up on it. i don't know enough about it to form an informed opinion.\n  ","417383":"\n  i think communism makes sense in theory, but realistically it can't be applied in modern times.\n  \n  i remember researching into communism ages ago, and i agreed with a lot of it. but that was years ago so idk if my opinion has changed.\n  ","417384":"\n  i know what the soviet union is, lmao. i just don't have an opinion on it.\n  ","417385":"\n  i don't have any thoughts on it.\n  ","417386":"\n  y'all should ask me questions, i'm bored af and drinking some delicious tea (not metaphorically, i actually have peppermint\/lavender tea).\n  \n  i'll answer anything as long as it isn't blatantly inappropriate ~~\n  ","417387":"\n  i got 50 percent on the quiz.\n  ","417388":"\n  mine has a playlist too, but i haven't listened to it yet. i might boot it up later tonight on my tv for background noise though.\n  ","417389":"\n  people cheat, but if he was unhappy then he would talk to me about it. we're not teenagers anymore and we're fully capable of having mature communication.\n  ","417390":"\n  i've never heard of it before tbh.\n  \n  my biggest fear is abandonment.\n  ","417391":"\n  mine wasn't very eventful. i listen to video game soundtracks at work so that was the entirety of my recap.\n  ","417392":"\n  that's exactly my point, lol. if he wanted to cheat on me or if he was unhappy with our relationship then he would simply break up with me.\n  ","417393":"\n  i write press releases, newsletter features, and website content for clients.\n  ","417394":"\n  it's easy money, so sure. i haven't done it in a few weeks, though.\n  ","417395":"\n  i sometimes do freelance work on the weekends.\n  ","417396":"\n  if he pitied me, then he wouldn't have spent eight years of his life with me. lmao.\n  "}}
