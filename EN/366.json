that's raising awareness online, signing petitions, donating to bail funds, buying from black-owned businesses, attending protests, etc etc.\n  \n  if you're in a position of influence, then i do think it is part of your responsibility to speak out against racism for your followers even if that isn't necessarily part of your \"job.\" if you have your own private reasons to not speak out, then that can be respected, but i also don't believe that people should just ignore what's happening.\n  ","392994":"\n  people who ab*se animals are often people who also ab*se their

definitely a little haunted, lmaoo. we had another experience two nights ago.\n  \n  -- my roommate was awake around 3-4:00am, when me and my other roommate were fast asleep. he then heard a really loud sigh coming from his own bedroom that wasn't his own, nor was it his cats, but he turned on his lights and nothing was there.\n  \n  other strange occurrences ;\n  \n  -- last week, i was in the kitchen and my roommate was in his bedroom playing video games. our other roommate has a habit of making that weird \"squeak\" sound through his lips when he's thinking. however, at that moment he was at work. my roommate and i both heard that sound, and my roommate calls out, \"leigh, is [name] home?\" and i go \"no, he's at work.\" then we both realized we heard the same exact sound, but neither of us did it.\n  \n  -- one night a month or so ago, i woke up randomly at 4:00am. i heard footsteps going down the hallway, but didn't think much of it because i know my roommate stays up late. we were talking a few days later, and apparently he also woke up randomly at the same time and heard the footsteps too, even though all of us were in our beds and our other roommate was sleeping.\n  \n  -- again about a month ago, i was in my bedroom and my two roommates were in the hallway just talking. we all heard knocking. i assumed it was the front door, but it didn't sound like the front door sound (like that hard wood type of knock). my roommates were really confused and started searching around the kitchen and living room, and they were knocking on things to try to replicate the sound to see where it came from. apparently it was a knock on the kitchen radiator -- however, no one was in the kitchen, not even the cats.\n  \n  -- my roommate has been in the basement on several occasions and thought he saw shadows out of the corner of his eye, but nothing was there when he turned around. this has happened on numerous occasions.\n  ","393245":"\n  if anything, i build up emotional walls more than anything else. i'm very hesitant to talk and get to know new people because i don't know their intentions, and it's difficult for me to trust others.\n  ","393246":"\n  i would tell my 18 year old self that things *do* get better in terms of my mental health, and that working towards my goals is the strongest way for me to reach a level of being content with my life. i would tell them that i would finally move out of my parents' house and start a new life for myself, a life in which i'm free from judgment and ab*se and can live according to my own terms.\n  ","393247":"\n  chester bennington from the band linkin park. even though he d*ed three years ago, he still has a resounding influence on me in terms of his strength through adversity, his love for his fans and family, and his passion for his interests.\n  \n  when i was growing up as a teenager, linkin park's music was important to me and they essentially pushed me forward to see another day. i'll never be able to thank them enough for that.\n  ","393248":"\n  i've kept this question in my inbox for a week, trying to think of an answer. i don't know if i identify strongly with any movie or book characters, besides possibly susanna kaysen from \"girl interrupted.\"\n  \n  however, who i identify with the most is actually a video game character: chloe price, from the video game series \"life is strange.\" i've always related to her personality, actions, etc etc., and felt a lot of empathy towards her during the game.\n  ","393249":"\n  money is an important aspect to most people in terms of their happiness because it provides them with a sense of economic security, which is integral to really \"thrive\" in today's age.\n  \n  however, people can be happy without money if they have a strong support system, whether it's friends or family or their partner. cultivating interpersonal relationships is super important to an individual's happiness.\n  ","393250":"\n  i love different aspects of all three of them, aahh !!\n  \n  i think i would pick one -- mainly because i've been craving to go to the beach with a frozen cocktail in my hand. i'm not much of a fan of firework shows, but i've never seen a spin fire show before and that sounds really interesting to me.\n  ","393251":"\n  i would get a full body tattoo of all different types of flowers, perhaps a sleeve on one arm

and i don't owe any money towards it anymore.\n  ","393257":"\n  i think it's amusing more than anything else, particularly when it's online such as on askfm. when we're conversing with people online or posting things online, you're only getting the side of people that they're comfortable showing to you. you're not getting the entire person. so in that vein, it's wrong to assume that you know how someone thinks and\/or acts, because you only know what they're willing to tell you about them.\n  ","393258":"\n  iced coffee. lmaoo.\n  \n  even if i'm in a very depressed slump, the idea that i have iced coffee (or coffee in general) is sometimes enough to make myself get out of bed and start the day. it's a pretty strong motivator in my life.\n  ","393259":"\n  eh, not really. i haven't been so focused on the future as much as i've been trying to focus on the present moment. in the future, i do want to publish a book or an anthology of short stories, but that's the only major goal i

learned a lot while we were together.\n  \n  i think one of the most important things i learned is how to stand up for myself and speak my mind \u2014 he encouraged me to be honest and open communication with him regardless of how bad or angry i felt, and i slowly became more comfortable with expressing my feelings without having a fear of judgment or anger in return.\n  ","393266":"\n

a fact-checker on his tweets, lmaoo.\n  ","393713":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","393714":"\n  no, that goes against constitutional rights and he doesn't have that authority anyway.\n  ","393715":"\n  i'm sorry that this is happening -- your partner shouldn't be invalidating you like that. your feelings are real and shouldn't be disregarded, and perhaps they're in denial themselves.\n  ","393716":"\n  LOL. especially after repeatedly calling me a terrible person, as if that's supposed to ~\u00b0~ offend ~\u00b0~ me.\n  ","393717":"\n  go cry about it.\n

past few days have been out of control, lmaoo.\n  ","393720":"\n  lmaoo, i've literally never heard anyone use \"my woman\" before. it's always been \"my man\" or \"my dude,\" at least where i live.\n

One thing I'm concerned about is I don't even trust myself to not get attached. Even if he backs off and agrees nothing significant will ever come out of whatever we have, it's still natural for me to get overly attached and over think every moment. \/: it makes me want to run\n  \n  --\n  \n  i understand the feeling all too well, i often get attached to people and then i end up getting hurt because they either do something or say something that isn't meant to be harmful, but because i'm so attached, it has so much more significance to me and my mind races with everything they say.\n  \n  perhaps through that distancing, your attachment won't happen. it's also good to be aware of when you are or aren't becoming attached, so the fact that you recognize that you're the type of person to attach themselves to someone is a good thing. it means you can prevent it when you see the signs happening.\n  ","393729":"\n  you can't place blame on one specific person or thing because everyone is responsible to some degree, mainly in terms of government for not enforcing quarantine rules quickly enough.\n  ","393730":"\n  at the moment, it's \"stupid\" by ashnikko ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/VbQrhOWkonk\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","393731":"\n  that would be met with a lot of opposition, and it's easier for me to just suck it up and help them every once in a while then be faced with even more yelling and verbal ab*se on a regular basis.\n  ","393732":"\n  LOL, omg aw. this is super sweet ~~\n  ","393733":"\n  forensic criminology, especially things like blood spatter analysis and ballistics. i took a course in high school on this subject and it was super interesting to me.\n  ","393734":"\n  i think people like watching sad movies because it can be cathartic for them -- if they need to express emotion but don't know how, or they need to cry and can't bring themselves to cry, then sad movies provide that sort of release and comfort.\n  \n  scary movies are a bit similar, but i believe that's more to elicit an adrenaline rush and feeling of excitement more than anything else.\n  ","393735":"\n  ah, thank you !!\n  ","393736":"\n  (cont) ... Instead of just cutting him off. Today he brought up wanting to be with me again and I told him he needs to not be so quick to be ruled by emotion and just be realistic. I don't want him to get hurt. I also brought up talking every few days instead of everyday and he didn't want to hear it at all. He was literally cutting me off and going blah blah blah lol. I just don't want to keep talking frequently and letting his feelings grow then letting him down. I asked him what he would do if down the road I started dating someone, and he said the thought makes him sad and why would I date someone when I have him? So now I'm not sure what to do. I told him us being together isn't going to happen and he said even if I say no, he won't give up so easily. So yeah, I really don't want to cut him off & I still enjoy talking to him but I'm not sure what to do. \/:\n  \n  --\n  \n  oh man ... the fact that he says he wouldn't give up easily is really red flag-ish to me, honestly. he's not respecting your feelings, and it sounds like he genuinely believes he's going to win you over no matter what it takes (which can be alarming).\n  \n  i would be cautious. even if he doesn't want to stop talking as frequently, you have the option to not reply as frequently. you've already made yourself abundantly clear to him it seems, and he just won't accept no for an answer.\n  \n  if not replying as frequently doesn't work and he freaks out or threatens you in any way, that's when i'd cut him off completely. right now, he seems harmless but he's showing signs that he could be dangerous if not given what he wants. like i said, he obviously isn't taking no for an answer.\n  \n  please stay safe, friend. this guy is really giving me bad vibes.\n  ","393737":"\n  unfortunately, i'm not sure who the artist is. but this is a gorgeous painting rendition of the halo franchise.\n  ","393738":"\n  kudos to you -- i wish i could break contact completely, but that probably won't be able to happen until i move out of state. even though i'm not close to my parents, i still see them every week or two in order to help around the house. my mother is disabled and my father is in his mid-60s, so they require some extra help every now and again.\n  ","393739":"\n  my parents ab*sed me for 15+ years, so i try to keep contact with them on a low, as-needed basis. i feel no emotional connection to them whatsoever and i'm doing much better without them in my life as much.\n  ","393740":"\n  no, i'm not close with my parents.\n  ","393741":"\n  LMAOOO.\n  \n  well that's certainly a different opinion. regardless, no -- that made no difference in our relationship.\n  ","393742":"\n  i don't feel like explaining it again. i've explained it so many times on askfm, lol.\n  \n  we're still friends, though, and there's no animosity between us. that's all that really matters.\n  ","393743":"\n  yeah, we broke up last year. lol.\n  ","393744":"\n  my bedroom is the most relaxing spot in the house for me, lol. i have everything i need here -- my television for movies and shows, my xbox for video games, books for reading, my laptop for working and writing, my bed for sleeping, and two windows to let in all the sunlight and cool breezes.\n  ","393745":"\n  the cliffs of moher look beautiful.\n  ","393746":"\n  good morning !!\n  \n  i'm feeling fine today thus far. i woke up perhaps 30 minutes ago and just finished eating breakfast, and i have to log into work in another half hour.\n  \n  i watched the movie \"parasite\" last night for the first time, and holy crap that movie was intense af.\n  ","393747":"\n  depends on my mood in that moment. sometimes i'd rather stay home, while other times i prefer to go out or order takeout.\n  ","393748":"\n  i used to go to the caf\u00e9 with friends before quarantine started, and it was a lot of fun because the caf\u00e9 we would frequent also played live music at night, or poetry readings.\n  \n  obviously now that i've been stuck at home and working from home, i've been making my coffee at home. it's fine for me, but i do miss coffee shop coffee every now and again.\n  ","393749":"\n  i'm not the biggest fan of muffins, but banana nut muffins and blueberry muffins are pretty good.\n  ","393750":"\n  i don't have a boyfriend.\n  ","393751":"\n  LOL. yeah, that does sound pretty contradictory when you compare those two answers, huh?\n  ","393752":"\n  it's spring where i live, haha. but it's been pleasant -- mild weather, but an unusual amount of gray days.\n  ","393753":"\n  they feel entitled to other people's attention and\/or affection, and get angry when they're not given those things in the manner in which they think they deserve.\n  \n  they were raised in a society where male dominance is normalized, which tunes into their egos and makes them believe that they're obligated to be respected even if they haven't done anything respectable -- solely because they're a man.\n  ","393754":"\n  if this doesn't exemplify quarantine life, idk what else would.\n  \n  ask me questions, friends ~~\n  ","393755":"\n  i only have a small circle of friends, but they do sometimes come to me if they need an opinion on something.\n  \n  i think i'm appropriately mature for my age.\n  ","393756":"\n  probably because they're unsure of how to approach a situation and they value my input, especially since i've often been in the same positions as many of my anons who ask for advice.\n  ","393757":"\n  here ya go ~~\n  \n  (to the anon from earlier asking for advice -- i'll get to it soon !! i want to answer it from my laptop because it's a long inquiry.)\n  ","393758":"\n  i wasn't dismissing it. i was offering a perspective from another approach that could challenge your notion and make you look at it in a different manner.\n  \n  i couldn't care less about what other people think about me on askfm, and if my friends on here have a different opinion or believe that my views are problematic, then they'd confront me about them.\n  ","393759":"\n  physically ; i'm feeling relatively okay, although a bit tired and my lower back hurts. i'm laying in bed for a bit just to relax and relieve some of that pain.\n  \n  mentally ; i'm a bit anxious at the moment for some reason. i've been feeling it all day & i can't put my finger on why. i just took my medication, so i'm hoping it kicks in soon.\n  ","393760":"\n  depends on your definition of radical. half of my head is shaved (well, not at the moment due to quarantine), and some have considered that a bold move.\n  ","393761":"\n  i've seen a few articles where that is up for debate, primarily due to sociological studies where women are seen as submissive due to a past history of ab*sive relationships, and being submissive means less harm will be done to them. it's easier for the survivor to compartmentalize ab*se by being submissive to it as opposed to trying to establish dominance, which will create violence.\n  ","393762":"\n  it could be, sure. there's a difference between what a person thinks something is based on their own experience versus how something actually is based on objective reasoning.\n  ","393763":"\n  eh, it can go either way. i'd personally write \"give feedback.\"\n  ","393764":"\n  i never said you were the same anon, lol. i didn't really think that either.\n  \n  you're basing your assumption off of ... how well a series of erotic books were sold back in the day? that isn't really a logical or factual source of information.\n  ","393765":"\n  there's no reason why someone can't be both, haha. i don't exactly know what i'm interested in besides how my ex was when we were together.\n  ","393766":"\n  you can't really say \"most\" when you've probably only dated a miniscule fraction of the population of women. it may be true in your own experience, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's true on a universal scale.\n  ","393767":"\n  depends on the individual -- you can't really make a blanket statement and say \"all women want x\" or \"all men want y.\" everyone has their various preferences, and it all comes down to how well your chemistry is with another person.\n  ","393768":"\n  i'm tired, but overall fine. i just clocked out of work and i'm relaxing in bed, lmaoo.\n  ","393769":"\n  any sort of problems, whether big or small, should be discussed in relationships -- if you feel the need to ignore a problem to keep the peace, then there might be some communication issues that need to be addressed.\n  ","393770":"\n  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  \n  it isn't any of my concern, so i don't care.\n  ","393771":"\n  i only took it like ... three times, and it was INFJ every time. i haven't taken it in a long time though.\n  ","393772":"\n  i seldom buy new clothes unless i realize that i new some new shorts or tank tops or something for the change of seasons.\n  \n  i don't get embarrassed like that, and there's nothing wrong with recycling outfits, lol. i probably wore the same 9-10 outfits every two weeks.\n  ","393773":"\n  well if you're talking about users from years ago, then yeah -- they're not active anymore. i follow like 30 other people though, lol.\n  ","393774":"\n  ???\n  \n  i simply answered a question, lmaoo. there are plenty of active users on askfm who post every day. like i said, it all depends on who you follow.\n  ","393775":"\n  either cherry garcia or chocolate chip cookie dough.\n  ","393776":"\n  no, they're a bit different from each other. there are some good examples on google regarding the differences between race and ethnicity.\n  ","393777":"\n  not generally, no. there was so much drama back then, lol. and askfm is just as active now (at least for me), it all depends on your following and who you follow.\n  ","393778":"\n  that is indeed my personality type, yes.\n  ","393779":"\n  uh, you realize islam is a religion, right? it isn't a race or ethnicity.\n  ","393780":"\n  yeah, my roommates and i rent a house.\n  ","393781":"\n  i agree !! and perhaps, my roommates and i want to first invest some money into getting some outdoor patio furniture, a grill, and a firepit.\n  ","393782":"\n  this is pretty typical of the area i live in. we could plant things if we wanted to, but this is what the yard looked\/looks like when we started renting the house.\n  ","393783":"\n  i only speak english.\n  ","393784":"\n  exactly -- and even though things are being documented now through video and photos, most of these law enforcement officers aren't being punished correctly. a lot of them are put on \"paid administrative leave.\" which is so sickening.\n  ","393785":"\n  somewhat, yeah. i only really see the articles that come up on my feed on facebook and twitter. i don't regularly read the news, though.\n  ","393786":"\n  in the majority of circumstances, absolutely not. look at all of the protestors who are white who have been rallying in groups against quarantine. nothing bad has happened to them at all, even though they're breaking rules and regulations and probably even laws by doing what they're doing.\n  ","393787":"\n  i don't mind the quarantine, honestly. i've been working from home for over two months, which has really been great for me. i'm wondering if i can work from home permanently considering i don't necessarily need to be in the office and can do everything regularly from home.\n  \n  i'd like for stores and restaurants and bars to open when it's safe to do so. i don't believe it's safe enough yet where i live.\n  ","393788":"\n  i honestly don't know much, even though he's the governor of new york. i don't even watch the press conferences and i mainly just read the news articles afterwards of what's going to happen in new york.\n  ","393789":"\n  there's video footage of what happened. it's the same story as what has been happening to people of color for years upon years when they're confronted by law enforcement. this is just another example of racial prejudice.\n  ","393790":"\n  his name was george floyd.\n  \n  the entire situation is tragic, and it only proves that most law enforcement is wrongfully discriminatory against people of color. george floyd was m*rdered, and the officers involved should be reprimanded for their gruesome actions.\n  "}}
