Thanks Regina \u2763\ufe0f\n  ","946171":"\n  Idk...you mean like quality 'me' time? It's been a bit but I'm thinking since I'm finally recovering from having a panic attack all day, I might just take the rest of the evening off. Basically meaning more hw for tomorrow\n  ","946172":"\n  My stomach aches\/abdominal pains\n  ","946173":"\n  Where I'm at now, I feel like less people are....but how would I really know....I guess I just say that bc a lot of people at my school seem to be extroverts while I'm an introvert and tend to do a lot of thinking. But that's probably some other people too. My school is gigantic so it's hard to say. I do feel at the base of the lonely spectrum though meaning I am very lonely and so just end of thinking a lot, observing or watching other people and learning from that\n  ","946174":"\n  Yes, but all the ones I remember are bad\n  ","946175":"\n  I don't drink it\n  ","946176":"\n  No I'm just the same except with a years more worth of hurt\n  ","946177":"\n  Same things I do every other day\n  ","946178":"\n  I never played it before, but probably Yoshi if that's an option\n  ","946179":"\n  It already passed this year\n  ","946180":"\n  Why would I want to know.....\n  ","946181":"\n  Death\n  ","946182":"\n  Snow maybe\n  ","946183":"\n  Yeah\n  ","946184":"\n  Sleeping probably\n  ","946185":"\n  Neat\n  ","946186":"\n  Idk....maybe Avengers Endgame?

If it's super tiny, I doubt it make do anything bc the iPhone 8 is IP67 dust\/water resistant and so I don't think a very small amount of whatever you put in there can do too much damage as long as it isn't some chemical.
