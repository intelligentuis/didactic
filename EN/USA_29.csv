   Any idea where your current misery is coming from especially when you were feeling so well when you were doing weed?  Like, does your misery always lay dormant inside you waiting to express itself in your life when it can?
  ","
  because my body is uncomfortable. That's why I'm miserable. It's not an existential or emotional misery it's a pained one. My body's endocanniboid system was supplemented and my system was running smoothly and then I took away the cannabis and now I'm sputtering and flailing for a few days until I even out again.

  all I said was ""foot surgery"" lol.

  ","
  yeah I spent years talking to doctors about why my skin welted up at just the touch of my fingernail I thought maybe I was allergic to my fingernail polish or keretin itself or that it was a pill side effect or something but it turned out that it was just an allergy to sulfates so like, it's fine now and I spent all that time freaking out for a few not that important hives.

   What part does mourning play in the death of a loved one? Like, does it help even if one knows the person isn't coming back?
  ","
  I'm not sure how to answer. Everyone mourns differently and for different lengths of time. Some people need to believe in an afterlife. Some people are okay knowing that it's the end. Sometimes death is expected and mourning doesn't hit as hard because it's been spread out over time already.

  "
157314,"
   Has your skin always been great? Or only after drinking water?
  ","
  I had terrible skin as a teen. Not like, see-a-doctor-about-it bad, but definitely cyclical acne. I continued to get zits through my 20's but they definitely slowed down to one or two a month once I started showing signs of schizophrenia and started feeling thirsty all the time. So at age like- 19. My skin has definitely improved with lots of water consumption I also use very simple, natural products from the company Lush. Herbalism is a cleaning paste, and Imperialis  the moisturizer. For about 6 years now that's all I use and it's improved the texture of my skin even more.
  "
157315,"
   Do you drink enough water? How much?
  ","
  I drink soooooo much water. I have a comorbid-with-schizophrenia disorder called psychogenic polydipsea that causes me to feel thirsty constantly so I literally always have a drink in hand. I drink about 4-5 liters of water a day, at least. It's been pretty beneficial actually like I have a super healthy urinary tract and my skin is always hydrated and I never get hungover

  Apparently one of the things the did tell someone was that my spatial relation skills was particularly sharp. I agree with this, my chosen career was visual merchandising because I really excel at design within a space like a window display or whatever.  Also, I was reading at a college level by 3rd grade so that was tested a lot as well like vocabulary comprehension and understanding plot lines to complex stories

  Bernie would have won. He would have won because American loves old white men. Even though he's like a bajillion years old. Because he's not a woman. He's not Hillary. I know at least a dozen people on social media who were vocal about not not voting for Hillary and instead writing in Bernie or not voting at all because they couldn't handle a woman president.

  ha yeah. Like all the people who are like 1/28th percent native american or whatever and trying to claim that.
  
  I descend from English upper class/royalty so we intermarried with other white Europeans so I'm most probably a mix of those. I know from my research that includes France, Germany, and Portugal.

It's white supremacy in action and it's so far ingrained in us that even the most regular, normal, non-racist white people end up saying and thinking dumb shit like that under pressure

   I plan on sending out gaming related questions to everyone sometime soon. Send me the names of the games you play. They can be videogames, card games, table top games, board games etc.
  ","
  so people who have been with he here since the beginning might remember vaguely that I worked in video games. I didn't work on anything that ended up actually shipping but I was very invested in the gaming community for a couple of years because it was my job to be so. This was sadly during gamergate so it almost has become sort of traumatic for me to be honest. Like Once my partnership dissolved and all my work was abandoned, after fighting through ALL OF THAT GARBAGE that year as a woman in gaming on Milo's infamous ""SJW"" List I can hardly bring myself to care about games now.
  
  That all said, I loved skyrim and actually 100% all of the acheevos which only something like 4 percent of players did. I will def play the last chapter of Kentucky Route Zero when it comes out. My favorite modern game is Nuclear Throne and my favorite classic game is Yars' Revenge. My favorite game growing up was Carnival on Atari. I used to have recurring dreams about the mario games.

   Is your mental health improving over time or diminishing?
  ","
  I am diagnosed with schizophrenia, panic disorder, OCD
  
  I was diagnosed with major depression but I am as of last week's shrink visit in FULL REMISSION !!
  
  schizophrenia is considered ""in remission"" because I take antipsychotic medications. When I don't take those meds, positive symptoms occur. Even with the meds, negative and cognitive symptoms occur. I wouldn't say they have gotten worse or have led to diminished mental health, but they are def holding steady.
  
  Panic disorder, same thing but beta blockers are the meds, which keep my body from producing adrenaline. Without the pill, I still over produce adrenaline. So it isn't a better or worse thing either, it's just what it is.
  
  I have no current treatment for OCD and it comes and goes.

   how can you tell when someone compliments a person's youthful appearance if its a ""judgement thing"" or not a ""jugdement thing""?

  because a woman's value is in her looks still. Men ""rate"" and judge women on their looks constantly probably without even realizing it it's so ingrained. Women who are more attractive and more youthful are rated higher and therefore have more worth and are treated with more respect. I call it pretty privilege. When a buddy of my husband's calls him a babyface, it's a tease or a ""manly"" compliment but when someone tells me that I don't look my age it's because they value that in a woman.
  "
158837,"
   i dunno tbh. i know lots of people who brag that they got id checked at the liquor store who are only 25 so it's pretty ingrained all around that looking young/younger than you are is so important. anyways, i like to give compliments when i think someone looks pretty/stylish whatever their age!
  ","
  yeah it's weird. I dunno. My husband looks young for his age but when people compliment him for it it's less of a judgement thing. And then like, the only thing I saw (mostly men) talk about when Birdbox came out was that they didn't approve of how Sandra Bullock had aged. It's so gross.

  women are still judged on their looks and ""how well they age"" more than anything else. It's meant to be nice but it's also kind of a reminder that women still aren't seen as equals.

And to be able to age at my own rate without constant comment.

   No, it's not personal & you don't need to apologise for anything.üòÇ I just had some people answering in a real ""you're genuinely stupid for thinking that's the full phrase"" way and then going on to ignore what I had actually asked so I figured I'd send this to everyone instead of individuallyüòÇ

158852,"
   Okay, guys....I know about the full phrase, but I'm specifically asking about the shortened one. Please don't respond to the full phrase, I want people's responses to the shortened one, that's why I asked about it. I had planned on asking about the full phrase after but there's no point now.

  obviously I disagree with the shortened phrase or I wouldn't have brought the full phrase up.
  "
158853,"
   I was aware of the full phrase, which I agree with but I wanted to ask people about the shortened phrase bc I disagree with it, it's shortened to suit people's narrative and bc I feel like it's more polarizing.

   What's your opinion on the phrase ""blood is thicker than water""? Is it something you think family members say when they do wrong and are trying to influence you into dealing with their wrong doings time and time again or do you think its true because most people's families are who raise them?
  ","
  the phrase itself is a shortened, misinterpreted version of a saying that translated into ""the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"" which means that your bond to your blood brothers, essentially, is stronger than that of the family bond.
  
  So considering that, I agree.
  
  I'm not close to my family I feel more strongly about the people I chose to add to my life. They have less expectations and judgement

   what does it mean your depression is in full remission, and how is that accomplished? im on medications and the best i ever get is maybe a couple weeks of feeling good, then i feel like crap again.
  ","
  it means it's no longer considered a chronic illness for me. When you're in treatment you're considered in remission, and full remission means unlikely to reoccur. I don't know how this happened I spent some years in therapy I learned mindfulness I have an emotional support animal, I got older, I take meds, I smoke a ton of weed, I guess it was just a little bit of all of those things that led to beating depression. It's possible I guess. I agree with the diag, I haven't been depressed in a while I definitely feel like a weight has been lifted in that way

   Any idea why East Coast doctors and West Coast doctors are so different in that regard?
  ","
  the whole vibe on the east coast is one of constant rushing. The doctors are just booked solid without stop and they have no time to spend important time with patients. Here, everyone's (or at least many doctors) are part of clinic groups where they have good support and lots of doctors to choose from and 4 day weeks and good benefits I guess so that helps I'm sure? I love every doctor I've seen in Washington and they've all been a part of the same clinic.

  Here on the west coast I do. East coast doctors I felt like I had to fight so hard to be heard. They never had time for patients.

  yes. Birds are incredibly good at reading mood and reacting appropriately it's one of the reasons my psychoanalyst and I decided on a bird as an emotional support animal. I've adapted to stay calm and friendly around her so that she has a calm and friendly vibe all the time and it helps us both.

I started working when I was 15 and I didn't stop until I was forced to by my illnesses. Furthermore, I am doing well enough now that I planned on asking my psychiatrist about going back to a part time job somewhere because I want to raise money for some household repairs. Maybe the grocery store or the florist.

   ‚ùÑÔ∏è This winter in the UK has been mild so far, however it‚Äôs been the worst I‚Äôve known for friends catching nasty viruses and getting sick. I‚Äôve also read about outbreaks of measles in the USA and Scarlet Fever here. 
Have you managed to avoid getting sick recently, wherever in the world you are? ü¶†

   Are you doing anything fun for your birthday?
  ","
  not really! My husband works until like 6 pm so we're just gonna eat mc donalds in front of the tv lol. Which is fine with me. I plan on waking up, spending time with Bubo, drinking as much coffee as I want, and wearing something comfortable. We'll go out to my favorite Lebanese spot on Tues night, his next day off.

  ","
  Sure there's a chance.My family aren't as easy going as I am.
  "
159363,"
   Do you think that Bubo dreams?
  ","
  I don't know but I did read an article the other day that says that a parrot's brain has as many neurons firing off as a primate, despite the small brain size. So if monkeys dream, then parrots might also.
  "
159364,"
   What is it about owls that fascinates you?
  ","
  I'm not sure. I've always liked birds in general and still do but owls seem so powerful and steeped in lore. Owlbeasts as part of Native stories and the theories connecting owls and alien abduction make it more interesting. They're pretty and dangerous.
  "
159365,"
   How did you come up with the name Bubo?
  ","
  the latin name for a great horned owl is bubo virginianus and I collect owl stuff
  "
159366,"
   What are the night terrors symptoms that Bubo displays?
  ","
  she screams and flies around her cage, running into things. Get's really spooked in the dark. I worry that she'll hurt a wing.
  "
159367,"
   Does Bubo imitate other sounds like voices etc?
  ","
  no I wish. that's more of a male parakeet thing. She did start making a big parrot noise after being in boarding at the parrot store while I was out of town for a while but she rarely does that anymore
  "
159368,"
   Does Bubo have a cage cover that you put on each night?
  ","
  I don't cover her cage because she gets bad night terrors so I just leave her in a semi-dark area of the house with a night light on just for her. Since I go to bed so early it works out for us. If I stay up late I just end up having to sit in the dark while she snoozes.
  "
159369,"
   How are you with change?
  ","
  neutral. It takes some time to get used to new things but I don't fear change or dread it or anything.
  "
159370,"
   Are you ok doing public speaking?
  ","
  nooooo I hate public speaking. I don't mind being the center of attention but I hate when people expect me to say something important or relevant. Art shows in the past that required a speech got skipped.
  "
159371,"
   Does your house have dust bunnies?
  ","
  right now very much so lol. I'm not cleared to do any heavy housework or anything because of my foot surgery and my partner only helped with the cleaning for like the first 2 weeks of me being unable. My birthday is the 13th though I'm considering hiring someone to come deep clean as a gift to myself

  "
159373,"
   what is glaucoma and why do you have to toke up for it
  ","
  it's a degenerative eye disease caused by too much pressure building up in your optic nerve and causing damage to the eye. Cannabis reduces eye pressure. Since I've started regularly smoking, I've been able to give up the glaucoma eye drop prescription completely and maintain healthy pressure numbers (my eyes and field of vision are fully tested every January, I'm going in for this year's next week) .
  "
159374,"
   Which one is the proper way to say: I miss your fragrance or I miss your scent.
  ","
  either is correct.
  "
159375,"
   Ever not even feel like smoking weed so you don't?
  ","
  yeah sure I slip it here and there but I do have glaucoma so I don't take long breaks.
  "
159376,"
   Do you get the same high each time you smoke or does it vary?
  ","
  I don't really get high. Like occasionally I'll switch up strains or method of consumption and I'll get a little high but that's short lived and rare. Mostly I smoke a small amount throughout the day to maintain my health not to get high. I actively avoid high THC strains when I can choose because I'm more interested in the benefits of CBD and terpenes
  "
159377,"
   Do you think it's cruel to clip a birds wings so they can't fly away?
  ","
  no I don't think it's cruel. That said I don't clip Bubo anymore because it's just healthier and better exercise.
  "
159378,"
   Do you think that Americas military budget is justified?
  ","
  nope
  "
159379,"
   Were you ever tempted to join the military?
  ","
  nooo. The air force kept calling me as a teen though.
  "
159380,"
   WTF is military town?
  ","
  like a place with a large military base. Like I grew up in Norfolk, VA where there are several Naval stations so everyone who lived there was in one way or another serving the base population, which could be people from all over the country because when you join the military they assign you to a base and you have to move there.
  "
159381,"
   Have you smoked today yet?
  ","
  of course I smoke practically hourly
  "
159382,"
   What kinds of music do you like?
  ","
  electro pop
  "
159383,"
   Like, are you able to tell what state someone comes from by the way they talk and how they act?
  ","
  at least approximately, yes. Unless they grew up in a military town like I did. Those are more homogenous because so many different backgrounds are transported there.
  "
159384,"
   Does each American state have its own unique culture?
  ","
  yes. Some are more like others and some are resoundingly unique but each state is different.
  "
159385,"
   Do you think that everything is virtual reality?
  ","
  no. I believe we are really actually existing here right now with all of the consequences and rewards that come with that
  "
159386,"
   So why does he want to go ahead with such a crazy idea?
  ","
  because he, like his fan base, is afraid of brown people. Meanwhile at the Canadian border today over a million dollars of meth was seized, but no one cares lol
  "
159387,"
   What's actually going on with this Mexican border security thing?  Is it all that Trump is making it out to be?
  ","
  no of course not. Illegal crossing is in fact down from previous years. Most sexual crimes are committed by white men. The wall will disrupt natural habitats, run through tribal lands, and cost ridiculous amounts of money for a non-threat.
  "
159388,"
   Have you been personally affected by the government shut down?
  ","
  not directly. I worry about produce not being inspected. I wish I was flying somewhere right now because NOW is the time to fly with drugs. No one cares.
  "
159389,"
   Do you mean roller skating or ice skating?
  ","
  roller skating. I've never been ice skating.
  "
159390,"
   Do you sleep with your partner or on your own usually?
  ","
  My partner is in the habit of coming to bed at a normal hour and then waking up from something or other at 3-4am and moving to the sofa at that time. So both.
  "
159391,"
   Are you usually a good skater?
  ","
  I'm pretty good. my parents met at the roller skating rink when they were teens. I grew up skating. I am way out of practice and it takes a little bit to re-adjust to it but then I'm fine and can skate backwards and all that fun stuff.
  "
159392,"
   In what ways do you think you'll change in the next 10 years?
  ","
  well I hope to become physically stronger, now that I've addressed all of my previous health concerns and am pleased with my treatment the next step is to try to reach a healthier weight and build some muscle. So I hope within 10 years that will change from now.
  "
159393,"
   Ever do a messy bun with our hair?
  ","
  yeah. right now it's damp so it's in a particularly neat bun.
  "
159394,"
   Do they give you a reason if they reject your ultrasound?  Like, is it usually price related?
  ","
  The only thing I've ever had rejected was a blood thinner and it was cost related. My doctor had two more doctors vouch for the more expensive one because of additional benefits though and they ended up approving it on appeal. That was a few years ago though.
  "
159395,"
   What criteria does your insurance company use to approve your bone stimulation ultrasound machine?
  ","
  I have no idea. I don't deal with any of that the doctor's office submits the request and then I wait for a phone call
  "
159396,"
   What is your latest disappointment ?
  ","
  the x rays weren't good on Wed, my bone on this foot just won't fuse all the way it's like it gave up on healing. I have to postpone my roller skating party for several MONTHS and I'm waiting for insurance approval of a bone stimulation ultrasound machine to use to try to stimulate bone growth.
  "
159397,"
   Are you still awake Allison?
  ","
  nah I was sleepin. I'm up now.
  "
159398,"
   Do you believe people can change if they love someone?

   Do you take contraception even though you may not be having sex?

159402,"
   Like hot orange juice?

  yeah. but watered down. You can't just heat the oj it tastes weird. You gotta heat water and then add cold oj. and a dash of cinnamon sometimes. And if it's after 5 pm, a shot of rum
  "
159403,"
   How is Allison today?
  ","
  I'm good, relaxing my hurt ass foot with bubo and drinking a hot orange. Went to the mall earlier and picked up a fenty highlighter palette and also this year's birthday gift. Went to the parrot store and got Bubo three new toys. Went to the grocery store and got a slice of key lime pie for later.
  "
159404,"
   Opinion on modern music? Like the type you see at the top charts?

  whewwwww I have no idea. I was mandated by state to see a therapist after an attempt on my life and that was not cheap because it had to be someone approved by the local hospital and I wasn't insured. that was at age.....22? 23? from there I went off and on through the years for about $100 a pop until I was insured and then I started seeing specifically only psychotherapists because I was already diagnosed so seriously so even insured that was still about $100 a pop. and that's weekly to start tapering out to monthly and then as needed in each case.

  that certainly has something to do with it I'm sure I'm part of a 1% population with schizophrenia but something like half of the population has anxiety so obviously there is a ton of concern about treating anxiety because it just helps the bigger majority of people

  her father was also mentally ill and withheld affection and was very hard. I believe she has an untreated personality disorder and that she just really wasn't prepared to have me. By the time my brother came around a decade later, she had learned more motherly behavior but it was just kinda too late for me at that point I was afraid of her already.
  "
159541,"
   What was the most negative aspect of your schizophrenia when you saw things and stuff?  Like, did the hallucinations ever threaten to hurt you in any way?
  ","
  no, one of my main and continuing delusional threads was that everything was an omen. This included hallucinations. So like, the cat was a good omen and the birds were a warning and the hat man was a threat that bad was coming. The orphan exists mainly to run out in front of my car and make me slam on the brakes so that's really dangerous (but I still have a license somehow lulz). None of my visual hallucinations speak and like I said before, I could tell they weren't real. The vocal hallucinations, like the voices, are mainly just judgey things not scary things or anything like nothing tells me to do stuff I just mainly hear my mother screaming at me that I'm not good enough.

Were the man in the hat and the cat always the same or did they change from time to time? Also, what do you mean by Chaos and how does it relate to hallucinations?
  ","
  shadow people are just like it sounds. Shadows of people shapes that just sort of go about their biz. I still see some walking in the yard out of the corner of my eye. the cat for me is always grey like one of those pretty grey cats with bright eyes. The man in the hat is basically a shadow person but more real and with a fedora. Delusions I've had include thinking my house was haunted, that my apartment was rigged to blow up and kill me, that my hands and feet would be chopped off in my sleep, that I was being monitored by the govt, that I was from outer space and delivered here by aliens, I dunno they can get really weird. What I mean by chaos is that I just don't care as much about consequences when I'm in a psychotic episode. I already do what I want but then it's like, that to a dangerous level. it doesn't relate to hallucinations it's just the overall mood.

  I'd be easily led into delusions. Most likely mainly that the govt is monitoring me. I'd start seeing certain things in my day to day life that weren't there. Repeat hallucinations for me have been a cat, a man in a hat, an orphan,a flock of blackbirds. Shadow people. Chaos. I would stop trusting people close to me. Self esteem would plummet because of the feeling that people are out to ""get"" me. I dunno I mean I lived that life for a long time and sometimes it was pretty normal like now but there was always something I was trying to ignore because it didn't belong. My mother's voice screams at me in my head. My behaviour is reckless.

  I feel great now that I'm on meds for 5 years lol. Not all from birth, most acquired as I aged like schizophrenia doesn't generally start showing symptoms until early adulthood (19 for me) PTSD is from a period of traumatic years with an abuser, sacroiliac joint dysfunction is from a bad work injury when I was 23, osteomalacia was inherited, breast disease was inherited, OCD started showing in early childhood like 6 or so. PCOS came with puberty.

  Now I""m worried that the next egg will be the same or worse or fatal! So I don't want her to have eggs. But even though I'VE stopped cuddling with her as much and stopped rewarding flirty behaviour she now has a boyfriend perch, a boyfriend toy, my coffee mug that she snuggles with, three plugs behind my monitor she likes and basically she loves everything and wants to mate all the time and it's really silly  (and now scary)

  renting in our area is extremely expensive and gets worse every year our apartment had already gotten up to like $1300 and it was just too much so we bought, which locks in a mortgage price for 30 years so we can't get priced out of our home.

  she's had two doses each of painkiller and antibiotics so far , which she hates and it's a struggle to squirt that shit in her mouth. This morning after her meds her appetite came back so I've been feeding her all her favorites.

She's a sweet strong baby.

  "
160836,"

  I had delusions that my apartment was haunted, that I was being targeted by a demon, that I was from another planet, that government scientists were trying to destroy my life as an experiment. I had hallucinations of cats, birds, men in hats, starving children, people running out into the road while I was driving. My moods were erratic and often lashed out and did inappropriate things.

  green, socialist, democrat I guess.
  "
160893,"

  I do, like I said, I have progressive beliefs. I don't care for the parties but I generally vote democratic.

  no I don't think that at all. if anything, it feels like the older generations like boomers are the most selfish

  I like June best
  "
160909,"
   From 1-10, how chilled are you as a person?

   (you dont have to answer if too personal or triggering) how would your life have turned out and/or how would you be right now if you hadnt found your husband?
  ","
  well I'd be on disability unless I was married to someone else which is likely, I've not spent much time single in my adult life. Maybe I'd have moved back in with my dad.

  ","
  I doubt you did anything wrong maybe she just doesn't respond that quick to texts or maybe she got the message but didn't have an immediate response or maybe she thought ""I'll call them back"" and then forgot or I dunno really though as a forgetful auntie it's probably not personal

160915,"
   Is it possible to fall in love with someone you just met online?
  ","
  not ""just"" met probably but after time sure
