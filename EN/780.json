plan for how you re going to get out . because you need to . if you re being controlled and have limited access to money , make sure the money you do get you save it and hide it away . while you re saving up this money , mentally plan what you re going to take with you , i suggest a backpack worth of only essentials . you can get your other stuff later with a police officer or someone you trust . also make sure the timing is right to leave , if they lock you inside when they leave , make sure they are fully gone from the house and break a window to get out . if you have zero access to money , as soon as you find a way to leave , go to a trusted person s place . . . if you are isolated and don t know anyone , the police is going to be your best bet even though i m a little iffy with them bad experiences . while you re planning your escape , don t act suspicious , that s probably the number one way to have your plan ruined . if you have money but don t want to go to the cops yet or at all , make sure you have enough money for a ticket of some kind if you know no one in your town city and get the hell out of there . basically my advice is to get out as quickly as possible
