, i have two cats that i m currently looking after .","271953":"i prefer short fingernails on myself . i can t type on my computer otherwise , haha .","271954":"i wouldn t say it s normal , but it is common .","271955":"his death only gave further reason and meaning behind the protests and the cause for which he stood .","271956":"i wasn t planning on it it just sounded as if it would taste good in that moment , rofl . either way , i fell asleep around midnight anyway .","271957":"scrambled eggs , two strips of bacon , and buttered toast .","271958":"it can be anywhere between pm and am .","271959":"i don t like areas where there are tons of people , it irritates my social anxiety and causes me to panic .","271960":"upstate new york , for sure . i dislike urban areas .","271961":"no , i don t .","271962":"i live in a house .","271963":"mental stability , and nah .","271964":"i haven t gotten that far into it during my current game , rofl . i totally understand though . i can play it for maybe an hour at a time , but honestly i do get bored of it pretty quickly .","271965":"i just said i have sims , lol .","271966":"eh , not necessarily people will always have their reservations about past relationships , and the best thing to do is simply respect their decision to not talk about their previous relationships . if and or when they feel comfortable , they may open up .","271967":"yes ! ! i played it a lot when i was younger recently made a new world a few weeks ago , lol . i haven t played it much since then , though . i have sims on steam .","271968":"usually , yes . it really depends on if i have the time motivation to research into it , though .","271969":"i don t really remember , tbh . it probably depends on the person . mine only got really bad after the th or th year .","271970":"yeah , that s a pretty ignorant way of thinking . nobody knows everything knowledge is limitless .","271971":"yes , it s extremely common . before i quit smoking cigarettes , i had a terrible smoker s cough which was one of the main reasons why i decided to quit .","271972":"these are the ones i ve been burning lately .","271973":"autumn is my favorite season , so most definitely .","271974":"i guess , although i m not sure what would be classified as metal anymore , lol .","271975":"yes , i have a lot of candles .","271976":"i got it at the liquor store . it s usually with the pre mixed margarita bottles . because i m a lazy b tch who can t make their own drinks .","271977":"it s some sort of bacardi pre mixed drink called zombie . it has bacardi rum in it with various flavors , and it s bright blue .","271978":"i made scrambled eggs , bacon and toasted rye bread for breakfast this morning . then for lunch , i had roasted vegetable crackers guacamole . i didn t eat dinner because honestly , i m not hungry . . . and i m also drinking .","271979":"hi friends , my inbox is nearly empty , so y all should ask me questions","271980":"people judge others based on the information they re given , which may not actually be indicative of who the other person actually is . also in some situations , people judge others based on their own pre conceived judgments of those people they ll believe that the other person is x , y , and z because they want to believe that they are .","271981":"it could be in certain circumstances , yes . it s pretty common for young students with higher intelligence levels to feel bored in classes at school , for example , because it comes so easily to them .","271982":"greek culture and cuban culture . primarily because my ex is cuban , and my best friend is greek well , greek and croatian .","271983":"i m not well versed in either topic , but i would assume the prevalence of voter intimidation is much higher than voter fraud .","271984":"yeah , that s still a really weird and unrealistic situation . that s the sort of thing that primarily happens in movies , rofl .","271985":"no , rofl . i m not going to travel to another country to meet someone else for the first time live with them . i wouldn t be able to date or love someone unless i was physically with them from the very beginning . also . . . i would want a job just to keep myself busy , even if money wasn t an issue . i can t envision myself not working a job .","271986":"besides my job , i have nothing holding me to where i currently live . however , i would have to devise a plan i . e . planning on housing situations , what kind of job i would get , etc etc . relocating somewhere else with a person you love unfortunately isn t as easy as it sounds .","271987":"no , that sounds very uncomfortable and awkward . i wouldn t want the other people to feel as if i owe them , or something . i also don t have the time or money to do such a thing anyway , so it s a pretty unrealistic hypothetical .","271988":"no , i don t have the time or money to do much traveling . i ve only left the country once when i went on a cruise to the bahamas .","271989":"i m not sure where you re coming up with this statement , but i have not hung out with a dozen people in at least over a year . i only leave the house once per week , lol .","271990":"i don t really have a lifestyle . i just work full time and basically stay home keep to myself . occasionally , i ll do something artistic like paint , draw , or write , but most of the time i m working and then relaxing with music and video games .","271991":"i wholeheartedly agree , although i m not sure what this has to do with me . rofl .","271992":"thank you , i appreciate your concern . my independence after moving out of my parents house last year has been amazing , and i ve already grown and bettered myself so much since then . i could never move back into that sort of toxic environment again .","271993":"very much so . my roommate and i hung up halloween lights throughout the house , ahah . on friday , we re going to package up some candy for the trick or treaters on halloween .","271994":"both , unfortunately . i m still recovering from the trauma of my younger experiences , and also , my parents still have a role in my life particularly my mother . even after i moved out , she has still tried reeling me back in . on more than one occasion , she s asked if i was happy where i m living now and asked me to move back in with her . it s just frustrating . i ve slowly been distancing myself from my family the last time i physically saw them was july , but every time i do talk to them , it s always the same old thing of when are you going to get tired of living there and move back in with us ? ugh .","271995":"i don t discuss my personal finances on the internet .","271996":"eh , i don t really feel as if i have true freedom because i m still always burdened by financial obligations , which keeps me situated in a place where i cannot afford to do things that i genuinely want to do . i m not really sure what my own definition of freedom is , though . in the past , it used to be having an escape from my old household where i was under constant scrutiny ab se , but now that i m mostly freed from that unfortunately , not completely , i still feel a bit trapped at times .","271997":"tbh , i probably wouldn t last very long , lol .","271998":"express yourself without fear of judgment , mind your own business and don t involve yourself in situations that have nothing to do with you , and engage in acts of self care while keeping your best interests in mind .","271999":"yes , absolutely . most often , these people aren t aware of it because they were raised in environments where mental health was not spoken about , so what is actually a mental health concern may be misconstrued by them as a character flaw .","272000":"i don t believe i can affect the entire world obviously , but for me , i do try to share knowledge about the things i know to people who are willing to listen by using a platform i . e . social media . i talk primarily about mental health , because i believe it s important to open lines of discussion of mental illness .","272001":"or , we should normalize the line of thinking that there are a significant number of people who do struggle with mental illness , and mental health as a whole should be spoken about more often to erase the stigma associated with it . mental illness is just as important as physical illness to deny that fact is invalidating those who struggle with mental illness every day , and we still have a long way to go before mental health is taken seriously .","272002":"most humans are naturally greedy and selfish , which often taints their views of the world and society , as well as how they act towards other people . i think one of the better ways to really solve or improve this issue is by constantly spreading knowledge , factual information , and logic . of course , some people will always remain steadfast in their close mindedness , but trying to improve the world is better than doing nothing at all .","272003":"this sounds like a complicated situation so basically , he asked you to marry him , and when you said you weren t ready yet , he broke up with you ? that s honestly just . . . bizarre . perhaps try talking to him again and gain a better understanding of why he wanted to break up . obviously you both love each other , and just because you don t feel ready now doesn t mean you won t feel ready in the future .","272004":"this will probably always be one of my favorite videos https youtu . be favupd ijvy","272005":"not very far , tbh . i m really impulsive and spontaneous .","272006":"cashier at a drug store i was promoted a few times while i was there to photo technician , photo supervisor , and pharmacy technician . either way , the store itself was run horribly and it was a never ending anxiety attack .","272007":"it s funny you ask this because i recently watched a biden vs . trump video from epic rap battles of history prior to this , i completely forgot that the youtube channel existed . i used to like them a lot . i really love this stephen king vs . edgar allen poe it has watsky in it ! https www . youtube . com watch ? v r hu fwzy","272008":"yeah , my favorite is probably salmon , mussels , and calamari .","272009":"most of my shopping is done on etsy and amazon .","272010":"i prefer frappes like the greek iced coffee drinks .","272011":"random men messaging me on facebook and being super awkward and cringey .","272012":"yes , i volunteered a few times when i was much younger late teen to young adult years .","272013":"abandonment by my loved ones .","272014":"no , i believe his actions and words sparked a global movement . it was a catalyst for change .","272015":"anxiety .","272016":"well i ve only been awake for around minutes , so thankfully no . but we ll see what happens as the day progresses .","272017":"i have four pillows on my bed , but i only really use two of them .","272018":"yes , i ve been driving for nearly years .","272019":"eating breakfast and waiting for my coffee to finish brewing .","272020":"yes , i m currently brewing a pot of coffee rn ,","272021":"the logic with this one is strong .","272022":"i just wear a simple black mask .","272023":"take my medication .","272024":"of course not . several people have dietary restrictions and food sensitivities , and it would be against their wellness to enforce a vegetarian or vegan diet onto those people . also . . . people have the freedom to eat whatever they want , lol .","272025":"i never learned how to ride a bike , haha . however , my city is pretty big with a main street where a lot of the shops and restaurants are , so i think it would be easy for someone to get around by bike if they wanted .","272026":"no , i m not a journalist . i took journalism classes in college realized it wasn t for me . i d rather work behind the scenes .","272027":"yeah , i ve written press releases in the past for my current job before i took on the role of the managing editor of my job s magazine publication .","272028":"most likely , yeah . sometimes i have a hard time with letting things go because i can t handle facing the reality of certain situations .","272029":"i own it , but unfortunately i haven t read it yet .","272030":"i m normally very wary of the news i see posted on social media , and i always check the source of the post before making a conclusion regarding the validity of the article . lately , i ve been too busy and tired to cross examine the news with different sources , but in general , i m pretty vigilant .","272031":"yes , i always cry when i watch the version of les miserables .","272032":"my day has been all right . i honestly felt horrible for most of the day because i was hungover from drinking smoking last night in excess , and i m like certain i had a weed hangover , rofl . however , i felt much better by late afternoon and then my roommate grilled us some cheeseburgers and fries for dinner . now i m listening to bring me the horizon and checking up on social media .","272033":"the first thought that enters my mind is that i should have spoken up against the ab se that i was enduring as a teenager , but at the same time , it would have simply made things worse for me which is why i never said anything to begin with .","272034":"for me , it s a tie between having a good sense of humor and being honest .","272035":"this has been in my inbox for a while , and tbh , i can t think of anything that i ve done that would be considered interesting . lol .","272036":"i disagree with the idea of zoos because in most circumstances , the animals are treated very poorly . i m not sure about how animals are treated in aquariums , though . i love going to the aquarium , but i do admit that i m not well versed in how the animals are treated in those places compared to zoos .","272037":"i don t have snacks in between meals , so idk .","272038":"eh , not necessarily . trans men are men and trans women are women , so if you re a cis man who is heterosexual and you like a trans woman , you re still heterosexual because she s a woman . however , if you like someone and find out later on that they re trans and that dissuades you from pursuing that person further , that can be transphobic .","272039":"oh , daylight savings , you mean ? i think it s strange how daylight savings is different for various countries , tbh . i ve also never really looked into the reason behind why we do it in the first place , though . i don t have much of an opinion .","272040":"i haven t been to many places , but i feel like i would exist well in either northern new england , the pacific northwest , or somewhere down in the carolinas . i would ideally have the same job as i have now , or some sort of freelance writing position . as for a house , i can honestly just envision myself living in a quaint apartment .","272041":"uh . . . i m not quite sure what you mean by time change ? time is a construct , ahah .","272042":"i think it s easier to hate someone than to love someone , tbh . that s why there s so much hatred and greed and selfishness in the world .","272043":"yes , that s quite common for people who are insecure or honestly , people in general . i don t necessarily believe other people when they compliment me on certain things , and in my worst states of mind , it makes me feel as if they re doing it out of pity .","272044":"there is such a thing as healthy competition , but it also treads a thin line because it s very easy to become too competitive to where it can hurt you or other people .","272045":"hey , future leigh don t get sh tfaced and high af tonight , because you re going to regret it tomorrow morning .","272046":"google . com can be your friend .","272047":"no , i disagree with this notion . not everything comes with a price , whether literal or metaphorical . sometimes good , wholesome things happen with no ulterior motive behind it .","272048":"no , i ve always washed my hands thoroughly . however , if i m just coming back into the house after being out somewhere , then i ll use more soap than usual .","272049":"aahh , i have so many . here are a few girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . the gargoyle by andrew davidson . the secret history by donna tartt . the shining by stephen king . interview with the vampire by anne rice . the trial by franz kafka . american psycho by bret easton ellis .","272050":"i believe there s good and bad in everyone , it all depends on which side we act upon .","272051":"honestly , i seldom remember my dreams the ones i do remember are nightmares , ahah . i can t recall any great dreams .","272052":"i normally just have it on vibrate most of the time .","272053":"sloppy seconds , moral of the story , k ll a hipster and roses .","272054":"i ve only done it when i had someone with me to wake me up when our

the train before .","272062":"aw , thank you tbh , it s all a matter of perception . i honestly hate how i look .","272063":"i m not the best person to ask this considering all i do is wash my face twice per day , lol .","272064":"i have three small meals per day .","272065":"no , i really couldn t care any less about what other people do on social media .","272066":"i use regular text messages

.","272082":"most likely , but not to the severe extent that we ve experienced this year .","272083":"i m fairly certain that has sucked for everyone on earth .","272084":"contrary to popular belief , nobody needs their significant other to be their other half . we re already whole .","272085":"honestly , my entire brain body shuts down when i either am getting yelled at or i hear someone yelling at someone else . it s a really major trigger of mine .","272086":"no , i remembered when i was feeding the cats after i clocked out of work . i went to go get dressed randomly remembered , lol .","272087":"i impulse bought a new mug , a new wine glass , and three candles last week . whoops .","272088":"no , i m lucky if i keep up to date on my own country s news , lol .","272089":"i just remembered that i have a therapy session in minutes , which is a lifesaver because i was just about to go to the pharmacy to pick up my medication . whew .","272090":"i honestly have no idea .","272091":"i hated commuting , lol .","272092":"hurricanes .","272093":"depends on my mood . sometimes i love my life because i m finally independent , while other times i absolutely hate it .","272094":"no , i don t hate anyone that much to want to k ll them .","272095":"i don t have anything in mind besides money .","272096":"the last time i went to the movies was years upon years ago .","272097":"no , i hate the sound of my voice i constantly stumble over my words .","272098":"i m bisexual .","272099":"i delete questions that aren t actually questions , that are inappropriate , that are in different languages , or that i don t really have an answer to .","272100":"dreary cloudy , and i think it s supposed to rain . perfect type of day to light a candle and listen to relaxing music .","272101":"i haven t been in school in nearly years .","272102":"i m five feet tall .","272103":"i prefer vegetables .","272104":"yeah , i did when i went camping . the facilities were super clean , though .","272105":"i m all right , thanks for asking . i m a bit tired so i m probably going to make more coffee or chug an energy drink .","272106":"i customized it with red sauce , ovalini mozz , parmesan , cherry tomatoes , basil , and olive oil .","272107":"today , it s very cloudy i think it s supposed to rain .","272108":"i seldom wear makeup .","272109":"happy monday ! ! this morning has been a wreck so i just ordered blaze pizza to cheer myself up .","272110":"i ve dated three people , and i ve only met the parents of two of them . my first girlfriend is actually my best friend now , so i ve known her family for well over years and we get along extremely well . my recent ex s family and i also get along very well i still remain in contact with them .","272111":"because karma is a lie , and good people always get the sh t end of the stick .","272112":"from what i know , a big indicator is a high fever accompanied by shortness of breath and chest pain . i ve heard it feels kinda like the flu but with worse respiratory symptoms . thankfully i ve never had those symptoms , but i know quite a few people who were diagnosed with covid . most people i know recovered , but others passed away .","272113":"it seems like pdq is only on the east coast according to their website , with most locations in florida . their chicken is so crispy fresh , though .","272114":"tbh , i don t like popeye s . pdq has the best chicken sandwiches i ve ever had .","272115":"better tasting food ? rofl .","272116":"i know . it s my own personal choice . there are plenty of other places i can eat .","272117":"chick fil a is homophobic .","272118":"if i m honest , a good portion of my answers are written when i m under the influence of drugs or alcohol , lol . like this afternoon , for example . my relationship with my ex was great , we just drifted apart towards the end and he didn t feel as strongly towards me compared to previous years , and nothing we tried doing could really bring that spark back . him and i are on great terms and we talk often still .","272119":"yeah , you should be honest with those around you .","272120":"i was miserable for months after him and i broke up and honestly , i m still sensitive about it all . what did give me some guidance through it was when i moved out of my parents house a few months after him and i broke up .","272121":"not massive , no .","272122":"i haven t had caffeine all day , so it was a caffeine withdrawal headache .","272123":"mayonnaise .","272124":"definitely not me , that s for sure . lmfao

.","272140":"no , not at all .","272141":"we went out to eat , and then we went to see a movie . it was really sweet , actually . we had burgers and milkshakes , and then we saw one of the wolverine movies that had just come out .","272142":"can t relate .","272143":"we accept the love we think we deserve .","272144":"every few days , probably . they re not usually pictures of myself , though

pretty","272153":"idk , i m not much into fashion . i feel most confident in one particular outfit , though ripped up red plaid leggings , combat boots , a black tank top with lace on the bottom , and some sort of zip up hoodie over it .","272154":"kinda the same thing as a family thanksgiving , except it s with our group of friends instead of our families .","272155":"i don t like thanksgiving . although last year , my friends and i started doing friendsgiving , which is a lot more fun .","272156":"no , i haven t . i don t really do that sort of thing because trying to go out east on the weekends this time of year is absolute chaos .","272157":"depends on the views and whether or not i m even aware of those views in the first place , lol . for example , i won t eat from chick fil a because they re extremely homophobic .","272158":"depends on how many people are boycotting , tbh . i wouldn t imagine it would do much if it s a billion dollar corporation , but everyone has the freedom to choose not to give their money to a corporation company that has viewpoints that are problematic .","272159":"okay , this is rly off topic but it needs to be said i went to watch one of the linkin park dvds and my f ckin laptop doesn t have a disc drive ? what the fck .","272160":"i just made my first tiktok ! ! https vm . tiktok . com zmjmduncu","272161":"hello do you have a question ?","272162":"it isn t unattractive , no . honestly , if someone regardless of their gender is crying every day , they re most likely depressed and need medical attention .","272163":"personality is more important , by far . how physically attractive someone is can only take them so far .","272164":"i m surprisingly good at games of deception , i . e . poker and especially now among us , lol . no one ever suspects that i m the imposter .","272165":"i don t partake in office politics .","272166":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company . i mainly supervise my company s quarterly magazine publication , including writing or proofreading the articles , getting editorial ads together , making indexes , writing the editor s note , etc etc . i also administer to my company s online newsletters .","272167":"when did i say politics are bad ? and what does that have to do with my job ? rofl .","272168":"no , i like my job .","272169":"i spent most of a week in february without using my phone when i went on the cruise to the bahamas , simply because there wasn t any service unless we were on land .","272170":"i have notifications turned on for askfm on my phone , but not my desktop .","272171":"yeah , and that s primarily apps on the cell phone , not necessarily computer based websites . years ago , i was in college and my primary form of communication with people were over text phone call oovoo and i also used forums . i think that was also around the same time facebook was starting to become popular , but i don t really remember .","272172":"no , the internet was booming years ago .","272173":"no , i haven t been to a party .","272174":"yes , toxic masculinity is extremely prevalent in society .","272175":"i just went to the store to try to find a rack that i can put in the kitchen for more storage , and i came home with a . foot long lighter in the shape of a giant match . lmfaoo . i wanted a candle lighter , but this will do the trick just fine .","272176":"perhaps if i was more in shape , yeah .","272177":"it s been fine thus far . i haven t done much since i ve only been awake for around two hours , lol . i plan on cleaning the rest of the house later on this afternoon , but that s the extent of my plans for today .","272178":"i ve taken a few steps toward achieving my goals . i finally have a job in my chosen industry writing and publishing , and i ve been living independently for over a year now .","272179":"i woke up around am , had breakfast and made coffee , and now i m drinking coffee and perusing social media . i also just quickly vacuumed and swiffered the kitchen floor too . last night , my roommate accidentally dropped a thermos of iced coffee luckily it was just black coffee so i wanted to clean it up before anything happened .","272180":"they re probably referring to the fact that i have a job that i enjoy that s really the only thing i can think of , and my job isn t even luxurious , lmaoo . i m not even making enough money for what people should make for what i do . which really , is an indication that i should find a new job , especially with all the bullsh t that s been going down . but i love my job itself my coworkers too much to resign , bleh .","272181":"my job has been occupying my mind a lot lately because of all the turmoil going on within the company . people are being laid off , sales are dropping , they cut our salaries across the board . . . it s been chaos .","272182":"not many people can , tbh . that s why i opted to rent a house with two other people as opposed to renting a one bedroom apartment by myself . it s entirely unrealistic .","272183":"no , the only health issues i struggle with are related to mental health .","272184":"i guess so ? lol .","272185":"basic skills such as how to budget my finances , how to write a check , how to check the oil and other things in my car , how to put gas in my car , how to apply for a loan , how to apply for a job , etc etc . i basically had to self teach all of these things .","272186":"i used to believe in karma and fate when i was much younger like pre teen to teenage years . these days as an adult , i don t believe in those things anymore .","272187":"i can write eloquently when necessary , but social media doesn t fall under that necessary category .","272188":"how so ?","272189":"i have never portrayed to live a luxurious life on the internet , rofl .","272190":"last night , i had a dream that like . . . there were a bunch of us hanging around a small community where the houses were very close together , and there was one adjoining property next to where my parents live that my friends and i would go to chill . there were stairs leading up to a garden on the roof of the property that was encased in screens so that bugs couldn t get in , and we were preparing for a large party that night . i don t remember much else , but it was certainly weird .","272191":"i suppose so , it s an average suburban house .","272192":"because suitable housing is considered a privilege and a luxury in the united states , not a right .","272193":"i couldn t care less about how i type write on social media social media is a place where i relax , and half the time when i use askfm , i m not even sober . lol .","272194":"i ve always thought the legend itself was interesting , and in fact , the first time i heard about it was when i watched the marble hornets videos on youtube years upon years ago . the event of the young girls m rdering their friend based on the slenderman story really shocked , but also interested , me . . . simply because i m very much into crime stories , haha .","272195":"my current job is great for me , even though the company is going through a lot of chaos rn . i thoroughly enjoy what i do .","272196":"taking care of my own emotional and physical needs , bleh .","272197":"i also type in all lowercase on social media , rofl . how i type on social media isn t an indication of how i write professionally and creatively .","272198":"my only talent is in writing .","272199":"i like crispy chicken sandwiches with lettuce and tomato .","272200":"absolutely not . circuses are terrible places for animals because they get neglected ab sed on a regular basis . animals shouldn t be hurt for the entertainment of humans .","272201":"i m not sure if i want children .","272202":"i slept for a solid hours straight , lol . i feel really groggy and hazy rn , so i m hoping the coffee i just made will fix that . otherwise , i feel okay . i m going out to brunch tomorrow with a friend , which should be fun .","272203":"i ve never had any traditions to follow .","272204":"my friend invited me over their house for halloween , but i m not sure if i even want to go , haha .","272205":"yeah , new york at least the city and long island is extremely expensive . in my region , you re lucky to find a one bedroom apartment for less than month that isn t in a person s basement . it averages around month for a one bedroom apartment around here . houses , on the other hand , normally go for , or so if you re looking to buy , and these are just regular ranches .","272206":"a driving instructor .","272207":"slenderman .","272208":"ayo , ask me questions ! ! i have some left in my inbox , but i feel like answering new stuff","272209":"i ain t chasing anything . i m way too fat for that nonsense .","272210":"pretty much any of the deaths from game of thrones , they were brilliant .","272211":"pretty much .","272212":"i went to austin , texas , in for a video game convention , and the city itself was so cute and eclectic .","272213":"i don t really do any halloween or autumn activities . my area is really big into the pumpkin patches , farm stands , apple cider tastings , etc . i don t do any of those things .","272214":"i prefer day time because i like the prospect of waking up early and getting productive things done throughout the day . however , i do still love the night time because it s when i relax .","272215":"i don t like scary movies , but i do enjoy psychological thrillers and gore movies .","272216":"abandonment and enclosed spaces .","272217":"i love stories about the chupacabra .","272218":"no , i m not superstitious at all .","272219":"teleportation ! ! i wouldn t have to drive anywhere if i needed to go someplace , which would make my life so much easier .","272220":"wendigos .","272221":"i don t eat candy .","272222":"yes . i m usually very anxious and jumpy , and i also can t handle most horror movies because they make me super paranoid .","272223":"autumn is my favorite season .","272224":"i got high and fell asleep super early last night , and forgot to put the garbage out . whoops .","272225":"i would love to travel . i just don t have that sort of money or available time to do so .","272226":"publish a book or a collection of short stories . move into a house or apartment on my own . adopt a lot of dogs . travel . progress further in my career . progress further in my mental health recovery .","272227":"i believe it was in february when i went on the cruise . i didn t have service , so i left my phone in the room most of the day for that entire week except for when i wanted to take photos .","272228":"honestly , i would think the most difficult choice a person would have to make is if they re faced with the decision of whether or not to take a loved one off of life support , or conversely , deciding whether or not to put their beloved pet to sleep .","272229":"the lord of the rings trilogy the movies hold a special place in my heart , because they re such comfort films for me . i also hate to say it . . . but the harry potter series the books hold a special place in my heart too because they were the first book series that really captivated me when i was growing up and made me realize i wanted to write for a living . obviously jk rowling is a massive b tch now , but alas .","272230":"love is a weakness when you re sacrificing too much of yourself for someone else and they aren t reciprocating the effort .","272231":"i believe that most people do judge to a certain extent , even if they don t consciously realize that they re judging someone else . it s an ongoing effort to humble yourself and understand that you cannot know what someone else is going through because you don t live their life . as for myself , i m sure i do judge others but i m not really aware of it much . i don t interact with many people to begin with , lol .","272232":"my cell phone , my laptop , my coffee maker , my medication , and my television .","272233":"don t put effort into someone who won t put the same effort into you .","272234":"circa .","272235":"i haven t read it in years , but it s always stuck with me because of the whole big brother thing and how it applies to society now more than ever before . i should re read it again .","272236":"the spooky decorations , the seasonal movies that are promoted during this time , autumn inspired food and drinks , the seasons changing , etc etc .","272237":"by george orwell . it s a classic book and it s also eerily insightful .","272238":"ask other people that s probably the most objective way to see if you re an open minded or close minded person .","272239":"moved miles to be with them and their family during a crucial moment in their lives .","272240":"it depends on the reason why everyone is against my idea . i would hear them out and consider their reasons , because obviously there is the possibility that my idea reasoning is wrong or not rational .","272241":"i never really knew shawnie i only knew of her and we never interacted . nevertheless , i was also shocked and saddened to hear of her passing , and my sympathies go out toward her family and friends . i felt the same way towards han i don t know if anyone knows who she is these days , she was active on askfm a few years ago . she was another amazing soul who was taken from us way too soon .","272242":"i always think of things like street styled tacos and other things you can order off of a mobile truck somewhere in urban areas .","272243":"surrealism is one of my favorite art forms ! ! salvador dali is one of my favorite artists .","272244":"i d take love over money . money is obviously very important for survival , but you can always earn money as time goes on . love can be fleeting and you shouldn t take it for granted .","272245":"i like baroque and renaissance art .","272246":"i write non fictional essays for the most part , although i do have some ideas for fictional stories .","272247":"my only talent is in writing .","272248":"yes , i love candles i m burning one rn , actually . i just bought three new candles from frostbeard studios you can find them on etsy . they re pretty much literature inspired candles and the scents are amazing . my favorite scents are earthy , things like balsam , campfire , rainfall , moss , leather , coffee , etc etc .","272249":"i ve heard that people usually do dream every night , it just depends on whether or not we remember them upon waking .","272250":"i had a really weird dream last night , but i honestly don t remember what it was at this point .","272251":"part of me by linkin park https www . youtube . com watch ? v stpzhsmb n","272252":"i m intelligent to an extent , but knowledge is limitless and there is always so much more to learn .","272253":"i never tried them before , but it sounds interesting ! !","272254":"i think he does it voluntarily , but it s also enforced in new york to some degree , idk how it gets enforced though .","272255":"oh wow . yeah , my father routinely takes a plane down to florida to see his mother every few months , but each time , he quarantines for two weeks after arriving in florida and then again when he comes back to new york . thankfully , he s able to work from home the entire time .","272256":"no need to apologize ! ! i wholeheartedly agree . i don t personally know anyone who has traveled , but i don t really know how law enforcement or the government would really keep track of it all ?","272257":"the united states is the same way even between certain states , i . e . new york and florida . if you travel to florida from new york or vice versa , you re mandated to quarantine for two weeks after arriving . there are other states that implement this as well , but that s the only one i know for sure .","272258":"i would quarantine myself for two weeks because that s what the cdc and other medical professionals recommend , and they clearly know more about science and viruses than i do . if you were diagnosed with covid and you still were out and about , then i believe that is incredibly selfish and ignorant .","272259":"right now i m watching the presidential debate .","272260":"honestly , most of the time it stems from their parents or how they were raised in general . a lot of people who bully others were raised in dysfunctional home environments , and the reason they bully their peers is because it makes them feel better about themselves having that sense of control .","272261":"i have wine , beer , marijuana , and cheetos . time to watch the presidential debate .","272262":"i guess it depends on what they re stealing , because there s a large difference between stealing something from a store or stealing a car for example .","272263":"i just re checked the circular . they were actually , lol . i don t feel as bad now .","272264":"two things of planters cheese balls . . . they were on sale .","272265":"tbh , i can t even think of one particular thing because i get sent the weirdest sh t on a regular basis . i just delete them immediately and forget about it .","272266":"i don t put in a lot of effort , because there are certain things i like regardless of whether or not they re on sale , but i do usually stick to items that are on sale that week . also , i m actually kinda bad at sticking to my grocery list , lol . i ll walk past something and grab it simply because i forgot that i enjoyed that particular food and felt like treating myself .","272267":"yeah , i met the members of linkin park back in when they were doing a meet greet with fans prior to one of their concerts . it was an amazing moment .","272268":"i believe it differs depending on the person because everyone has their own love language .","272269":"eh , sometimes it really depends on how i m feeling that day , haha , particularly with respect to rational versus irrational thoughts . like , if i know i m acting or thinking irrationally then i won t rely on that gut feeling because i know it s just my anxiety paranoia coming out .","272270":"it s easier for me to get to places by driving .","272271":"i don t really support zoos unless they re actually sanctuaries of some sort . a lot of zoos treat their animals very poorly and it s neglectful , and the animals always look absolutely miserable and unkempt .","272272":"communication .","272273":"honestly ? the game of among us my friends and i played two nights ago , lol . i walked into a room with a body , and two other people standing there , so before i could run over to report it , i got k lled by one of those people . it was a damn double k ll they were both the imposters . i was so shocked and angry , lol .","272274":"that s very normal and common .","272275":"oh , i definitely thought the initial question was platonic love , not necessarily romantic love . either way , i think the best way to tell people you have feelings for them is to simply be straightforward about it , and if they don t reciprocate those feelings , then at least you have the closure to accept it and move on . also . . . ngl , the friend zone doesn t even exist , lol . if someone doesn t feel the same way towards you , it isn t some sort of insult to you or a woe is me situation . that s just how life is . people aren t obligated to like you .","272276":"this is going to sound odd , but meeting my ex . not only did we have a good relationship while it lasted , but he also ended up becoming one of my best and closest friends even after we broke up , we ve remained close friends and talk on a regular basis . he also introduced me to a lot of his friends who have also become great friends of mine , including my current roommate .","272277":"traveling , i suppose . i haven t done much traveling at all , but the few times i have were very enjoyable .","272278":"just by simply telling me how they feel about me .","272279":"my mental illnesses .","272280":"one of my favorite books is girl interrupted by susanna kaysen , but i also like interview with the vampire by anne rice and the trial by franz kafka , as well as some stephen king stories . the last book i tried reading lol was a self help book for people who deal with toxic or ab sive parents . i stopped reading it , not because it was bad or anything , but because i just lose interest in books really fast these days . i can t remember the last time i finished a book .","272281":"primarily , just telling them how much they mean to me and what i appreciate about them .","272282":"thank you , i appreciate it","272283":"there s a local taco place that has really good pulled pork tacos and margaritas , so pre covid , i would go

music , and telling stories .","272286":"drinking , tbh . i m not exactly a person who can stop after just one drink . i either drink to get tipsy drunk or i don t drink at all .","272287":"my first

comfortable and happy .","272305":"i lied to my mother about what i did over the weekend , specifically on monday . i didn t think she needed to know that i attended my ex s father s wedding and was the photographer for their ceremony , lol . that would have triggered a whole slew of invasive questions .","272306":"no , i m too old for that nonsense .","272307":"i probably was when i was younger , but i don t recall any instances . i was also bullied when i was in middle school and early high school .","272308":"they re pretty much the same thing . love at first sight is simply lust over a person you do not know , and you re subconsciously filling in the gaps of who they are based on the little bit you know about them and loving the idea of them , not who they actually are .","272309":"i guess in a way , yes ? i m usually pretty friendly towards people , but i don t make friends outside of work these days .","272310":"without a doubt . i don t have any emotional

television . haha .","272319":"yeah , it was fairly diverse .","272320":"it wasn t really a poor area , but i used to live in an area where there was a lot of crime . demolishing those towns would be counter productive . rather , those areas should be given better resources to make it a better place to live instead of forcing people to relocate and probably become homeless as a result .","272321":"i d like to believe that i m mature , but i also still laugh at fart jokes , so .","272322":"the chilly weather and the changing colors of the leaves on the trees .","272323":"axolotls ! ! they re super cute , but i don t believe i m ready to own one yet because they re very sensitive animals and require a lot of special care .","272324":"my life has been consumed by work lately , so nothing else is really going on . i feel super empathetic towards my supervisor rn , because she s constantly being tugged both ways by our department like people got laid off in the past month alone and upper management , and i cannot imagine how upset and frustrated she is . so , my coworker and i chipped in and we re surprising her with a charcuterie board that s going to be delivered to her house friday afternoon . i have a friend who makes these amazing meat cheese boards , and she said she was willing to deliver it since it s local . i can t wait to hear from my supervisor when she receives it , i hope it makes her super happy .","272325":"it s a tie between early in the morning , around am because of how quiet the house is , or later at night at like pm . i like being able to relax at the end of the day .","272326":"no , i m too fat to be flexible .","272327":"depends on their personality . being jewish or conservative doesn t dictate how someone s personality is

. i do have facebook and instagram , but they re both private accounts .","272333":"i live in new york state .","272334":"yes , exactly . all of the horror stories i ve heard about circuses , and even most zoos as well , they all treat the animals terribly and it s disgusting . parading an animal around and literally ab sing them for human entertainment is horrible .","272335":"i don t know if anyone who uses askfm now remembers liam , but it was always nice to see his answers on my feed when he was active years ago .","272336":"i ve only ever visited the bahamas .","272337":"i baked myself

answering questions , not talking .","272345":"yeah , i prefer when things are very clean and organized . i m always putting things back in their place on my desk and in my room , as well as randomly around the house if i walk by and see something out of place .","272346":"definitely not .","272347":"probably my creativity , tbh .","272348":"yeah , i see nothing wrong with that . that has never happened , though , because usually by am , i m already sleeping or i m not even hungry .","272349":"i don t really understand why students would need to take a drug test . what a student does in their free time is entirely on them , as long as it doesn t affect their school work or they go to school high on drugs .","272350":"no , i m honestly terrified to go to haunted houses , both the fake and real ones . lol .","272351":"hello do you have a question ?","272352":"i honestly didn t think i would live to see my st birthday , let alone live to the age i am now . i honestly have no clue

poker at all and i ve never had an interest in it either , especially if real money is involved .","272359":"thank you ! ! i hope you had a wonderful wednesday . my day was exhausting , but at least it was productive for the first time in over a week . my old computer at work was slowly crashing on me , and they ended up having to swap the tower out twice because nothing was working and pages would take up to minutes to load . it was ridiculous . so yesterday , they gave me a tower that has windows installed on it everything else was windows , and things have been running so much smoother and more efficient . i m so grateful to have a good work computer now .","272360":"this is pretty much an everyday occurrence in my life .","272361":"i am hopelessly obsessed with that game , lol . i play it at least twice per week with my friends . last night , we were all awake until am playing for like four hours straight together .","272362":"i just bought pumpkin spice creamer yesterday , so

little interest in it .","272367":"i haven t personally , but i do know the stories quite well from other people .","272368":"hello i m all right , just ridiculously exhausted and it s only pm . work has been kicking my ass the past week or so , i ve legit just been laying in bed for the past two hours watching tiktoks . afterwards , i decided that i wanted to make myself cozy , so i lit a candle and grabbed a beer .","272369":"my hybrid theory box set is here , i m screaming .","272370":"drink , smoke , and or sleep .","272371":"wake up , use bathroom , make coffee and breakfast , take my pills , and log into work .","272372":"because of my work schedule , i have my alarm set to am every day , but i normally wake up earlier , like am .","272373":"usually nothing , because when i feel

.","272383":"i don t have any , haha . my only plans were for today i m home now , so i can relax and drink some wine .","272384":"music is motivating to me . i usually put on a video game or movie soundtrack , and lately i ve been listening to classical music .","272385":"yeah , i like halloween but don t really do much to celebrate it .","272386":"i m usually good at giving gifts , i like finding personalized things for people .","272387":"walking around the neighborhood , meeting your neighbors , visiting different local stores and restaurants , etc etc . which . . . i haven t done since march , lol . i ve been working from home since then have barely left the house .","272388":"it wasn t crowded to begin with , lol . both of my roommates well , i only have one now work full time outside of the home , so i have the entire house to myself half the time anyway .","272389":"i have one brother .","272390":"coffee , followed closely by tea . i rarely drink soda

.","272396":"no , it isn t raining . it s actually a gorgeous night out .","272397":"oh , that s weird . aakfm doesn t allow me that option .","272398":"my old roommate came picked up his two cats to bring them back to his new house , and now the mainecoon one of the other cats whom we ve been watching is crying and running around the house .","272399":"i answered this question two hours ago .","272400":"nah , it isn t awkward at all . i m still close with my ex and his family . my ex s father has been dating the same woman for like . . . years now , i think ? so she knows me quite well .","272401":"i wouldn t be surprised if i get offered money , but at the moment , i m photographing the wedding ceremony because they asked me to and i also wanted to i was thrilled when they asked me . it s actually my ex s father s wedding , haha .","272402":"he wanted a bigger space , and also his father just moved back to new york , so they re renting a house together . the house they re renting is decently sized , and the entire upstairs is open so he has the entire upstairs as his living area , basically . right now , it s just me and one other person living in this house . however , someone else is moving in soon so we re going to add her to the lease since we re not sure how long she ll be here for .","272403":"no , it s just a hobby .","272404":"it s all right i ve known this was happening for about a month now , just didn t know when . one of my roommates moved out a few weeks ago and they re technically his cats , so he s taking them with him to the new place he moved into . he texted me a few hours ago , saying he was stopping by tonight to pick them up . i just feel bad for my other roommate who s currently out of state at the moment , he won t get a chance to see them before they leave . we can always visit them , though .","272405":"i m doing all right , although i m a bit sad right now . i really am not looking forward to work tomorrow , but thankfully i only have a half day then i m photographing a wedding ceremony tomorrow afternoon . also , two of the cats living in this house are leaving tonight to go to their new home and i m going to miss them terribly .","272406":"the standard punishment that anyone would get if they flashed someone else without their consent ? i m not sure what you re getting at here , lol .","272407":"thanks to all of these bizarre pap questions , i won t be posting photos for the rest of the night .","272408":"? ? ? i m not obligated to post a photo just because you want it . suck it up and move on .","272409":"my answer still hasn t changed from three hours ago .","272410":"that sounds absolutely miserable .","272411":"listening to music that makes me happy , although it doesn t really boost my self esteem . it s more of a coping mechanism and distraction than anything else .","272412":"my answer hasn t changed from three hours ago .","272413":"i think i know who you re talking about , but i don t remember her name . maybe it was aly ? with that being said , we don t talk anymore lol .","272414":"not that i can recall , tbh . i still connect with old askfm users who don t use the site anymore on other social media , i . e . twitter and instagram .","272415":"a better blocking reporting system especially reporting , make it more in depth . the ability to edit our answers , smh . i m tired of deleting re typing if i make a typo . the ability to post videos from our camera gallery as answers . hiding photo polls from the general feed , it really screws up the algorithm .","272416":"probably not well at all , tbh .","272417":"thank you","272418":"delete and move on .","272419":"yeah , i have social anxiety so i often like the idea of socializing , but it also frightens me at the same time , especially if i have to physically go and drive somewhere to meet up with friends . also , it has to be in a quiet environment most of the time with not many other people . too much external stimuli overwhelms me . i prefer virtual interactions , i . e . texting or video calls .","272420":"uh . . . brown ? lmao .","272421":"i assume by normal , you actually mean natural . i like the brown on myself at the moment , but when my friend has a chair at a salon again , we re going to do some dark brown and bright red balayage .","272422":"i totally feel this . honestly , i really hope aoc runs eventually when she reaches the proper age .","272423":"from camping last weekend my friends were fishing in the creek .","272424":"most definitely . i didn t know much about warren , but i fully supported bernie . and bernie endorses biden and harris now .","272425":"i m not putting my hood on taking another photo .","272426":"i m five feet tall .","272427":"i totally agree she s a strong woman that isn t swayed by negativity and does not put up with people , particularly men , who try to control or speak over her . i loved the vice presidential debates , other than the obvious fly fiasco lol , but also because she stood her ground and kept saying , mr . vice president , i m speaking . wait your turn . more people need to see that .","272428":"i m comfortable with this one , even though i look like sh t rn , haha .","272429":"your reading comprehension skills are evidently lacking atm .","272430":"yeah , i agree with you on that . biden listens to science and reason , and he s also a much more well rounded and empathetic human being than trump will ever be .","272431":"they re literally black pants . so no .","272432":"i m wearing the same sweatshirt i wore yesterday , and i have black pajama pants on . so no . lmao .","272433":"ahh , no . that sounds disgusting to me , lol .","272434":"i watched ju on the original japanese version of the grudge when i was very young , perhaps way too young to even watch the movie in the first place , and it haunted me for months .","272435":"? ? ? you realize that there is no official language in the us , and the us has already been composed of immigrants with all sorts of different cultures in the first place , right ? this isn t something new .","272436":"i m aware . but you do have to realize that the process of obtaining citizenship in the us is extremely difficult and can take years to process . not to mention the fact that a lot of these immigrants are fleeing their countries to seek asylum .","272437":"this . . . literally makes zero sense isn t even a relevant comparison . lol .","272438":"i would still be immigrating to another country if i planned on living there , regardless of the primary language of that country .","272439":"np ! ! i agree . it literally affects nobody , so like , what s the big deal ? they re glasses . they improve your vision . however you want to express yourself customize them is entirely your choice based on what makes you happy .","272440":"lol exactly . it s so contradictory and hypocritical when people use that logic .","272441":"the optometrist s office like four years ago . lol .","272442":"i have the feeling it was negative because shehitsback has been getting nothing but negative comments about her glasses ever since she first posted photos of them a few days ago .","272443":"waffles , although i never usually eat either .","272444":"anons will literally find anything to nit pick , it s just amusing at this point the lengths they ll go to try to bring someone down unsuccessfully .","272445":"i like both of them , i wish i was bold enough to suit that style , haha . i desperately need to get my eyes checked and get new glasses . cc shehitsback","272446":"not very much , but i believe he s the better alternative . unlike trump , biden emphasizes that climate change is something we need to focus on more , and he also supports the lgbtq community and the right to an abortion . obviously i also believe he s hypocritical regarding women s rights , considering he supports survivors of assault yet has been accused of misconduct himself . but he has a . . . better ? . . . track record as opposed to trump , who has been routinely accused of severe s xual misconduct throughout his career by several women .","272447":"i ve never thought about it from that perspective before , tbh . that does make perfect sense , though .","272448":"i don t play these silly games .","272449":"also , the whole thing with him referring to mexican people are drug dealers , criminals , and r pists . that should have been enough .","272450":"i only know a few latinos who support trump , and they re cuban because they were granted citizenship immediately upon entering the country which is something that doesn t happen with other people who immigrate to the us . i believe it s all based on who you know , though . i ve had more conservative republican people attack me for expressing my opinion as a leftist , and those people definitely don t treat me as equal to them .","272451":"how is pointing out internalized racism an indication that i m racist ? it s very commonplace . i always found the contradiction about immigration to be amusing , tbh . y all are against people entering other countries , yet when people such as myself express their disapproval for how trump conducts himself , y all immediately tell me to immigrate to another country .","272452":"i m sorry that you feel this way . in all honesty , you probably have internalized racism , particularly considering trump has made derogatory statements towards mexican people in the past .","272453":"i already answered this , rofl .","272454":"thank you ! ! it truly is ignorant for someone to believe that there are absolutely no republicans who are voting for biden this election , i ve read heard several people who voted for trump say that they re shocked disappointed in how he has ran the country over the past years and are now voting for biden instead .","272455":"i offer to listen to them vent if they re comfortable doing so , so that i can support them . it s important to be present in other people s lives and show them that you care .","272456":"aw , thank you ! ! you re too sweet .","272457":"i m not sure how to prove it on the internet because they re people i personally know who do not use askfm , rofl . either way , you can peruse social media and find others who are saying that they re backing biden harris instead of trump this election when they previously voted for him last election .","272458":"yes ! ! i also know people who are republicans who are voting for biden instead of trump this election .","272459":"they don t scare me , but i absolutely hate them because the lanes driving through the parking garage are so small , and i can never remember where my car is . i definitely prefer regular parking lots .","272460":"i honestly don t remember what askfm was like six months ago , lol .","272461":"they re obviously a trump supporter . and even if someone doesn t identify as a feminist , that doesn t excuse the fact that trump has only encouraged his supporters to be racist sexist pieces of sh t .","272462":"i d like to see your sources backing up that claim , lol . either way , being a feminist isn t a bad thing . the reason why feminists do not support trump is because he s clearly a racist , sexist , xenophobic piece of garbage .","272463":"i really hope you re not referring to trump , rofl .","272464":"i never stated that the us was the worst place to live among all other countries . but for a country that is supposed to be one of the top countries in the world , it s led by a corrupt and reckless administration that does not care about the large majority of its citizens .","272465":"i guarantee you that i m not the only one who is embarrassed by having the us as their country .","272466":"i wish it was that easy , lol .","272467":"i always get weird anonymous questions .","272468":"no , my family doesn t hold family reunions . we don t have a closely knit family at all .","272469":"yeah , being a citizen of the united states is pretty much an embarrassment at this point .","272470":"i honestly have no idea . . . i don t think there are any foods that i could eat for the rest of my life without having some variety . perhaps potatoes ? those are pretty versatile , lol .","272471":"listening to music , writing something that i m proud of writing it makes me feel accomplished , playing video games and getting achievements on xbox , hanging out with friends outside around a campfire , the first dose of caffeine in the early morning , and rainy days .","272472":"no , i don t mind it at all . it s for the greater good , to keep yourself and others around you safe .","272473":"of course . most places won t allow you inside if you re not wearing a mask .","272474":"welcome ! ! if you have any questions about how to use the site , let me know .","272475":"no , just a doctor s appointment and some household chores .","272476":"yes , i do ! ! i love being in the outdoors , and i recently discovered a new love for camping .","272477":"i just came back home from going to the store , and now i m going to do some laundry .","272478":"yes , i did ! ! that is what prompted me to come on this morning in the first place , and then i was super confused because it didn t exist .","272479":"i haven t done anything this morning except wake up , make coffee , and eat breakfast , haha .","272480":"i prefer texting over calling , although sometimes it is easier to just call someone .","272481":"depends on my mood and if i want to put the effort into cooking , haha .","272482":"no , i associate it with the movie white chicks . rofl .","272483":"happy sunday i hope you enjoy your day too ! !","272484":"i have a virtual doctor s appointment today , and then when that s done , i m going to the drug store to pick up my meds and other household necessities .","272485":"not yet , i have to drop my ballot off at either a polling site or the post office this week .","272486":"lol . seriously , i haven t even received opinion on person questions in years . that made my morning .","272487":"lmaooo . what the hell , i thought y all meant opinions on topics not people . we re not in anymore .","272488":"ethnically , i am jewish . i don t follow judaism though .","272489":"thank you","272490":"yeah , i have a bachelor s degree in professional writing and communications .","272491":"wine . . . i m very possessive over my wine .","272492":"having a fire with friends , or camping .","272493":"supernatural ,

inspiration or attention span , so yeah .","272500":"it s an artificial intelligence device that you put in your home that connects to your amazon account . it s kinda like siri or cortana apple and

.","272501":"whoops .","272502":"i don t have an alexa , but i figure it would be good for listening to music . my ex has one in his apartment , and he just simply has to say hey alexa , put on this song or hey alexa , play this playlist and it ll start playing automatically throughout the apartment .","272503":"an officer can take off their uniform at the end of the day . what they do is a job .

.","272505":"oh boy , y all are gonna hear it tonight . i support euthanasia for terminally ill patients . i m strongly pro choice pro abortion . i don t agree with self diagnosis of complex mental illnesses i . e . anything other than depression anxiety . addiction is not a choice , it s a disease a mental illness . gmos are not bad for you . you can love animals and not be vegetarian vegan . donald trump is a white supremacist , a racist , a r pist , and a xenophobe . gender identities outside of man and woman are valid such as non binary , genderfluid , agender , etc . beer isn t a gross alcoholic beverage , there are a lot that are actually very delicious . you re an idiot if you re anti vaxx . marijuana should be legalized everywhere . the death penalty is archaic , barbaric , and k

not educated enough on the subject to have an opinion , lol . however , i ve always found ancient egypt and its practices to be incredibly interesting .","272541":"i just realized i m probably going to have to go run errands this weekend because the cats are running low on food , which thwarts my initial plan on staying home this entire weekend and relaxing . meh .","272542":"yes , i believe so .

get worse again .","272571":"we seldom fought , and when we did disagree on something , it was very civil and we talked through it . i had me time even while we were dating , so it isn t really much different now , haha . the only significant change is that ever since him and i broke up , i moved out of my parents house so i value my me time more than ever before because i don t have my parents breathing down my neck all the time anymore . i can actually have peace , quiet , and freedom .","272572":"yes , i got my absentee ballot in the mail the other day , in fact .","272573":"sometimes i do , but at the same time , i m also not interested in pursuing another relationship right now .","272574":"the american dream died years ago , and the united states is pretty much viewed as a joke by

askfm , haha .","272577":"the only routine i have is waking up in the morning to go to work well , now it s logging into work , and then doing whatever necessary household tasks i need to do after

was in your scenario , i would honestly be angry at my partner for demanding me to respond to them immediately and not take into account that you re literally grieving , in mourning for your dog . he

younger .","272651":"i think it ultimately depends on the kind of argument and the type of person you re arguing with . sometimes it s better to simply walk away if the other person is being irrational and belligerent . other times , it s constructive to walk through the argument with facts and reason as long as the other person is open to listening to them .","272652":"i learned how to build and dismantle a tent , if that counts .","272653":"my mental health has swayed between being much better or much worse , but i m definitely in a better place mentally and with myself now compared to last year when i was just moving out of my parents house . in fact , i moved into this house exactly one year ago today . during this time , i ve definitely become more independent and grown as a person , taken on more responsibilities , and learned how to be content while alone . i learned that i do really love household chores because i get to do them at my own pace and according to my own needs instead of at the whim of my parents , who were often very demanding and meticulous as to how i cleaned their house .","272654":"i used to love buttered toast with cinnamon sugar .","272655":"i honestly feel like glamping is a cop out because you re not actually camping , you re just taking a small place you can live in comfortably and throwing it into the wilderness , lol . i like roughing it . i have no issue with sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor of the tent , waking up to the sun shining through the tent at am , cooking food outside over the fire , etc etc . i don

.","272667":"i think an easier question would be what alcohol i haven t tried , haha . the only thing i haven t drank excessively is whiskey because i m not a huge fan of whiskey at all .","272668":"lol . listen , coffee queen , i don t have the coffee drinking abilities that i used to have ever since i switched to gfuel , rofl .","272669":"lol . he had many eggs to offer for trying

eggs .","272671":"my desk is a mess rn , sorry .","272672":"my creativity , my passion for my interests , and my loyalty to my friends .","272673":"absolutely ! ! i had so much fun , and i loved the aspect of losing track of time besides watching where the sun was located in the sky and sunrise sunset . we only stayed there for two nights friday night through sunday morning , but each morning was relaxing just sitting by the fire , drinking coffee and eating food over the fire and the afternoon was spent exploring and taking photos . i went to bed super early on saturday night because i was

necessarily constitute prison time , but i do know that if you re caught owning one , it s considered on the same level as a cocaine charge .","272685":"it honestly just annoys me . i can understand why some people may consider it flattering , but also , i don t understand why people aren t comfortable just being themselves and paving their own path in life . you can look up to someone without copying them .","272686":"i don t really like chocolate , it irritates my stomach .","272687":"i don t like baths , so it s been years .","272688":"i was on a conference call at work i still work from
