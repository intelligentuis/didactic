annoying","806546":"yes . all of the above lol","806547":"i m not a pet person truthfully . if i had a pet though and i do cause my parents got one , i would pick cat because cats you don t have to take cats on walks and they are generally quieter","806548":"i m not under , i just turned","806549":"i got a wii in and then stopped using it in about maybe . that s all the video games i ve ever played lol","806550":"yes and no lol . my main phone has always been an samsung and i prefer it that way , but before i had a smartphone i had an ipod touch and literally all my songs , games and pictures were on there so then i continued using it for those things and then when the ipod touch got too old and basically unusable , i bought an iphone se to replace it and restored the ipod onto it . so i use a samsung phone and then an iphone se with no sim card and carry them both around everywhere","806551":"not many . maybe two people lol , but i m pretty sure they forgot it by now","806552":"i would definitely go with android , but i have both and i wouldn t want to give up either . they both have great qualities the other doesn t . i m a technology person and used to be a phone nerd lol and most people you meet like that will say android and there are many reasons for that , but i would say it really depends on what a person wants with their phone . apple is generally more for for lack of better words simple and basic use , but android is for more tech savvy people who like more options with their phone","806553":"not sure","806554":"hello !","806555":"airplane i guess","806556":"sleeping","806557":"same lol","806558":"rarely . i ve times this month though dec jan , which is really rare for me . i saw lady bird , and then the greatest showman twice . tgs was a

it s fine","806562":"well , only if the boyfriend is okay with it i guess . if the guy is good friends with the boyfriend then that would help , but if that s not the case , i could see the boyfriend possibly getting suspicious of the friendship and then acting upon that . he could call off the relationship , which the girl might not want to happen , but if the girl considers the friendship more important , then perhaps she wouldnt want to lose it . ultimately , it would depend on the couple","806563":"well , do you still love each other ? is it a pain to see and hang out with each other or is it still something you both enjoy doing ? do you think there s a way you could work out your problems or are they just continuous and stressing for both of you ?","806564":"honestly , you re probably not her best friend then . she s probably just saying that because you are her friend and she s with you at the time , but if you both don t hang out and you don t feel close , you probably aren t best friends","806565":"getting wiser","806566":"that they can trust me","806567":"i made an instagram when i was . i introduced it to my bff at the time who made one about wks after me . we followed lots of the same people , but then i noticed people we both knew seemed to only friend request her . her account started gaining a lot more followers , so i felt left out . i deleted my account later bc it felt embarrassing . i think what it comes down to is that we need to stop letting social media define us . we feel if we re not getting as many likes on our posts that we re not good enough and it just ends up depressing us , when really we should all love and be proud of ourselves bc we are all just as worthy individuals . idk how or why some people just receive more love on sm like that , but i try not to worry about it . i know this wasn t much help , but idk how to get oneself popular . i just know that we shouldn t look down on ourselves bc of some likes on an app . we are special , even when some people fail to acknowledge it online","806568":"no , i strongly dislike poetry , and i have tried to write it and i am terrible at it","806569":"someone i

back","806595":"i m not attracted to guys , but i like it when they just be themselves and not always trying to act really masculine , and when they aren t judgmental , but instead are kind to everyone . i don t like sagging pants and i don t care for abs , but i think pullover hoodies look hot on just about anybody lol . also , i think it s more attractive when guys have short hair . like if they want to have long hair and or ponytails that s cool and their choice , but i just personally don t find it as attractive as when it s cut short","806596":"she was trying to catch a fly that was buzzing around the classroom and she put on a hat and said it was so the fly wouldn t recognize her while she tried to get it","806597":"some of us would be sweet and others would be
