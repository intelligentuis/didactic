when i was growing up , i changed my interests and my style to try and fit in with my sister . it was so stupid looking back on it , because it s not like it mattered anyways . she just isn t a good person , and it didn t take me too long to realize that i shouldn t change myself for anyone s sake , let alone hers .","725201":"no particular thing . rather , i miss something unattainable the lack of responsibility . as we all age there s more we have to become responsible for . bills , for one . the pressure to self sustain is another one . there s so much to miss about my childhood , but i mostly miss being more carefree .","725202":"the very first thing i think of when i wake up is checking the time . so i ll grab my phone and check it ! depending on what i see , i either roll on out of bed or go right back to sleep .","725203":"milk . when you re done cracking your eggs into a bowl , before whisking , add a splash of milk ! it makes your eggs turn out really fluffy and soft .","725204":"usually , no ! i mean if it s brisk enough outside i ll wear a jacket , but that s about it ! other than that , in winter i ll wear a coat and boots that layer over my pants .","725205":"now , i ve been doing my best to skew my perspective on the world s populous as a whole to be more positive . i can have a bad habit of getting cynical about people , and i ve made so much progress in that ! and then . . . this year happened , covid hit the states , and i ve been more cynical towards people because honestly ? it s true . the pandemic has brought out the worst in people , and brought the worst people out !","725206":"heyyy i never ignore questions ! rather , i make paces through my ask box and answer the ones i feel like i can get to at that time . i still have asks from three months ago that i ve yet to get to . . a lot of my reasons for skipping around are that , and i want to dedicate proper time to thoroughly answer thought provoking questions . i d hate to just shove out answers that weren t interesting , just for the sake of answering them ! it d take the fun out of it for everyone involved . if i m to engage with the community on this app , i want to be sure i have the dedicated time to do it right on a case by case basis . side note , i also seldom ever delete asks . if you send me your username , i ll scroll through and find your asks and answer a couple .","725207":"hi there ! how s it going ?","725208":"umm i don t know what zorbing even is ! never heard of the term until i read this . so my answer to the first question is definitely no . okay so i looked it up , and here s what i found zorbing also known as globe riding , sphereing , orbing is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb , typically made of transparent plastic . zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope but can also be done on a level surface , permitting more rider control . soo basically . . riding a human sized hamster ball ? ? yeah i m in , i d do it in a heartbeat if i could . that sounds so fun !","725209":"honesty . i m not talking about the bastardized definition of it , where people seem to think being bluntly rude equates to honesty . i mean the real meaning of honesty being expressive about their thoughts and feelings , being openly communicative , letting others know what s really going on with them , not lying just because it s easier . i could go on but i think the picture is painted proper . honesty is desirable in anyone i intend on speaking with , regardless of intention .","725210":"i loathe the concept of being dirty or covered in germs , so i would have to go without internet .","725211":"actually , none that i can remember ! when i cook i make sure to be really focused on the whole process . i have a tendency to be a bit of a perfectionist with it . maybe i ve had some small hiccups once or twice , but none that actually significantly affected my meal ! not to my memory anyhow .","725212":"when you sent this , i believe it was raining ! right now it s just kind of chilly brisk . earlier this morning i could see my breath it was so cold ! but now it s just a mix of sunshine and brisk air .","725213":"there actually was one other that started up , but i am pretty sure the website ceased to exist not too long after it was put up . . it was called bloffy ! and you could theme your profile in similar ways to how you could on old good myspace . i might be wrong but i m pretty sure it s gone , at least i thought it was the last i checked . . bummer . but yeah ! i have to agree with your side note ! carrd is really confusing to work with . it took me ages to figure out how to set up mine and even then , i only set up a basic looking site on there . it s something that i d imagine takes a lot of time to really work with and get accustomed to !","725214":"there s actually a lot that i like to do when it rains , but i primarily have two halves of me that favor certain activities over others . half of me wants to favor drinking tea and reading in pure , blissful silence other than the rain pitter pattering against the house then half of me wants to run around outside and just feel it wash over me . no one s usually going around outside when it rains so the hyper active part of me craves spinning around in my backyard , judgment free , just enjoying having fun in peace .","725215":"i love to photograph moments in nature . especially animals and critters if and when possible ! i love taking pictures and videos of my local neighborhood squirrels .","725216":"chicken paprikash !","725217":"i like them , yeah ! as with anything , the berry related flavors are my favorite . i want to expand and try more than i ve had though . . maybe from more

able to see someone special again . the time it takes until you re able to see someone you love again , and the distance between closes . it s always worthwhile to be patient for loved ones who don t

depict their fluffy tails . oh wait you said i d be a master at it . . okay well i think i answered that fine then lfjdndbd","725221":"this made me think of this cite gif below i m just gonna say , , thank youuuuu ! ! idk what to say !","725222":"a vegan is someone who doesn t use or consume any animal originated products , from meat to milk ! fur also . a vegetarian is someone who doesn t consume

the time of vine","725224":"yessss good taste gaaang ! ! i swear people always think something s wrong with me for hating pepperoni . like jeez i m sooo sorry i don t want to eat a grease tainted slice of pizza . ruins the flavors for me ! no thanks .","725225":"strawberry pound cake , from bath body works ! they have all of my favorite scents , from soaps to sprays ! i have a pretty large collection of their products actually . their products smell so good you could almost eat them . .","725226":"earlier when you sent this , i was having a tough time . i was trying to keep two dogs who seemed to have gotten out of their yard from getting hit by passing cars . they were just wandering around outside my house , and i had to crouch on the side of the road and keep them company . chicken teriyaki posted a picture of them on this neighborhood report app he has , and we called animal control to report their whereabouts . they went down the alley across the way and didn t come back out ! anyways that was all very stressful . right now as i m answering this , i m . . hmm i guess i m okay ! a little bit tired but otherwise fine . thank you for asking , i really appreciate it ! how are you holding up ?","725227":"heyyy good taste , good taste ! tiramisu is a very savory dessert . it s been my favorite ever since i first tried it . do you have any place you prefer to get it at ?","725228":"then let s ! ! . i definitely wouldn t mind if you spammed my inbox with stuff . hit me up any time ! you re more than welcome here .","725229":"my eyes are blue ! it was in taking this picture that i realized how hard it is to give yourself proper bunny ears with your own hand .","725230":"heck yeah , i am ! i just like to admire the things that others create . there s a lot of desserts and regular food dishes too that you can just visibly tell are made with the utmost effort and love , and i m all about that ! the creation of food is an art in of itself that i really like to appreciate . and that i can only hope to achieve some day . plus , some pictures of desserts are just . . visually satisfying . like if something looks really soft , or has a beautiful array of colors , it s just really appealing !","725231":"thank you so much , that means a lot ! how s life been treating you ? i hope you ve been well , but if not lmk ! i m around to listen","725232":"initially i thought , yeah why not , that doesn t sound too bad . i do like candy corn , and i do like chocolate . it sounded like an interesting combination ! then i thought about how tooth achingly sweet candy corn is already . adding chocolate to it would make every piece a missile aimed right at the nerves of my teeth . oof . . might have to pass . chocolate covered apples don t sound the worst , though ! but i d most likely just prefer caramel apples .","725233":"oh ! thank you sm ! , , , ,","725234":"here s my current top three favorites ! these are in constant rotation in my playlist . . . song title artist strawberry cream oeil shalala moses gunn collective communicationissexy idkhow communicate the aquadolls","725235":"i ve always loved red roses . i just looked up a specific type , and it looks like rosa mister lincoln is what i have in mind . here s a snippet of a description about it from its wiki rosa mister lincoln , also known as mr . lincoln , is a dark red hybrid tea rose cultivar . the color is very eye catching !","725236":"i d just avoid them . i m a relatively non confrontational person , so long as i can help it . besides ! if someone doesn t like me , that s not my problem it s their problem . i live to please no one else but myself ! senseless negativity and spite is never worth the time , effort , or attention .","725237":"i don t watch too many movies to begin with actually , so i don t have a favorite franchise for horror ! but i m always open to suggestions if you have any . i m pretty open minded to try just about anything !","725238":"oh goodness i absolutely love pumpkin pie ! it s a really cozy dessert . i ve unfortunately never had the privilege of making it myself , but i ve always wanted to learn how . desserts that involve pumpkin are pretty much the best part of autumn ! pumpkin pie , pumpkin roll , pumpkin spiced drinks . . i m hungry now . anyways , i ve only ever had pumpkin pie pre made and frozen to be baked . and the warming smell it fills the house with is phenomenal . the only thing i d imagine could beat that , is smelling a pumpkin pie you created yourself ! some day , some day . .","725239":"september was a month that was full of pain for me , but it was also a month full of learning and self development . so i have to say , over the last month i ve lost some but definitely won some too ! it s not been all that bad . i m striving to have october be a much better month . so far , so good !","725240":"i truthfully believe that the going gets easier over time ! whether or not it s part of us getting used to it is totally situational , but i for the most part hold the belief that things just get better . there is so much good in the world to experience to keep stuck in the mindset that things won t ever change ! i used to struggle a lot with shifting this mentality around , but it was over the passage of time that i was able to . i don t think it was from getting used to my problems , though . i think that more or less , i got into the it gets better mindset by surviving through all of my struggles . getting through those troubles made me stronger , more aware , and more level headed so that i might cope . and now that i m better at coping , i have the ability to strive for better . it just takes time .","725241":"nope ! i ve always had android os phones . i personally find apple s product pricing to leave much to be desired . way too expensive for what you get , in my honest opinion .","725242":"actually i remember learning some time ago in high school that it was originally made to show status . if i recall correctly , it was worn as a symbol of importance and higher wealth .","725243":"definitely immortality . at first i wanted to say endless supply of cash , but that means not a thing in comparison to living forever . being able to experience so many great things for all eternity sunrise , sunset , the change of seasons , love , technological development , scientific development . . i ll take all of that over infinite money any day ! plus , with infinite time to experience the world , i would feel much less pressure . i d be able to exist comfortably , with much less stress . that has more value to me than masses of wealth .","725244":"i let it dry on its own . which i know is technically not the best thing for your hair . . but my hair goes down almost to the backs of my knees . i d be spending at least an hour on blowdrying my hair if i wanted to go that route .","725245":"i don t fully believe in either , no . a big part of me wants to , but i guess i ve just never had any sort of reading to be able to experience any truth behind them .","725246":"today , you don t have to go to work . that s right , a monday

. be more focused on yourself .","725247":"not very often at all ! i d like to be more bold with the changes i make and when , but change is tough for me . i mean , my natural color is the color i have currently . i last dyed my hair innn . . like . . th grade ? maybe ? the last major alteration i made to my hairstyle is when bleached my bang tips !","725248":". favorite movie coraline .

just downloaded today .","725250":"my favorite thing to do in the fall is hike around wooded areas and observe the way nature is taking to the change of the seasons ! i like to see the changing of the trees , and watch animals prepare for the colder months to come . at least , that s what comes to mind for outdoor activity . much more boooring , indoors . . . i like to brew seasonal hot teas , read , snuggle up in blankets , play games , ehh etc etc . you get the picture . the cold makes me want to burrow in where it s warm most of the time ! but the beginning of fall is absolutely crucial for outdoor activity . the sight of the leaves changing is the best part of it !","725251":"hmm . . i don t have any particular favorite language ! not for speaking or hearing . though in favor for learning i think i d like to learn how to speak french , or japanese !","725252":"oh god kokichi turn around monokuma going to kill you oh no he has airpods in oh god oh fuck","725253":"an important part of coping in hard times is first understanding this pain and suffering do not correlate to who we are as people . a lot of people find themselves in such deep hurt that they spiral down a path of taking it out on themselves . holding the belief that one simply must have earned it to be going through hard times is an example of this . i promise , no matter how much agony you re shouldering , it s not a punishment . it s not happening because you did something wrong . in truth , bad things happen to everyone , good or bad . it s important to understand that it s all a part of life . life is full of ups and downs , and unfortunately we all sometimes go through those downs ! some of us go through it harder than others , but all the same it s not a direct stab at us from the universe when it happens . unfortunately there s no real how or why answer to satisfy this question . what matters is that we don t take it out on ourselves or others , and that we do our best to keep moving forward . i hope you find healing soon .","725254":"i feel like a lot of people have a bad habit of doing that to try and dissolve tension . i ve let a few people i talk to know before , that s a little weird . they usually say something along the lines of how they don t know how to appropriately approach things , and they don t know what to say . but they have to know and understand that it s not a healthy way of communicating , and learn how to drop it . habits like that don t allow you to develop your social skills .","725255":"honestly ? a hot mug of mint herbal tea ! it s something that always makes me feel extremely relaxed .","725256":"i ve had bad internet provider experience no matter who i get service from ! it s primarily because no contract plans are cared the less about . we get dished out the poorer end of any kind of service , because we aren t signing our money away by contract . i ve had it the worst with at t and verizon thus far .","725257":"i ve never gone to any parties that i ve actually wanted to go to , like with friends or whatever . i ve only really ever gone to ones with family , and those i leave as soon as i can . i get people d out pretty fast unfort . working on getting better at that though ! but has certainly hampered that progress . .","725258":"i ve got to be honest and tell them about it . genuinely , most of the time if a friend or someone you know is being annoying they usually aren t aware of it . so i use an honest , but kind approach for friends particularly . hey , you re doing x and it s a little upsetting . can you tone it down a little ? something like that ! have never had a problem with that . if , however , it s a total stranger being irritating . . they are usually doing it on purpose . i m not afraid of being a little more blunt . not harsh , not brutal just blunt . forward . these people are usually in surprise that someone as soft in appearance as me can be that way so that usually ends it . if by chance they continue , i hope they enjoy being ignored . they re not worth the time or energy of even being recognized beyond that point .","725259":"my favorite season is spring ! it s when plant life begins anew , there s plenty of relaxing bedtime rain , and the temperatures are a gentle and tolerable warmth . also more critters start coming out in the spring like squirrels and such so that s always a plus ! i m also a spring baby , so maaaybe i m born with a little bit of bias . . ? hm , well ! either way . spring !","725260":"you re absolutely right ! only hoping things look up from here .","725261":"talking in front of groups of people is definitely not my strongsuit . performing , doing speeches , or presenting had always been something i would struggle with all throughout my

of physical paranormal experiences . at most , i ve seen weird stuff out of the corners of my eyes when there s poor lighting . or when i m sleep deprived . but i ve never actually laid my eyes on a spiritual entity !","725264":"i get right into my routine ! brushing teeth , using the restroom , going down to wash exfoliate my face . . then i come back up and moisturize before actually starting my day .","725265":"i m not sure who specifically you re referring to ! i assume , since i talked about going to visit him in august . . ? so i ll just answer off of that assumption ! i would go and re visit him , and re experience every single day i spent with him over and over again if i could . i play over the memories we shared in my head all of the time . . needless to say , i hold no

you d be looking forward to ? like , is there family there ? or is it just a place that fascinates you ?","725267":"generally uncomfortable , i d think . for eating , all around if were to watch me i d have a hard time not saying something about it . i can get really self conscious about the way i look when i m eating . i d worry that i m . . i don t know ! looking gross ? making a mess ? if one of my specifically were watching me sleep , i d think it was cute . and it might make me feel pretty good about myself , because i don t ever usually find myself to be all that appealing after sleep . but if i woke up to see one of their smiling faces , i d feel pretty happy . sheepish and shy , but happy .","725268":"feel free to spam me with questions any time !","725269":"i d go for tangerines ! at least based off of what i ve read . . i have never had an actual tangerine . but after what i just learned , they sound overall more palatable than oranges . they re sweeter than oranges , have less acidic contents , shorter aftertaste , and are more flavorful according to this one blog post . that sounds right up my alley !","725270":"i m not familiar with the name unfortunately . what genre does he create in ?","725271":"actually , yeah ! i noticed that i have a weird preference towards my left side . i don t necessarily think the other side is bad , per se . but i definitely have a preference of turning to show my left side .","725272":"the texture of most baked fruits really bothers me ! most especially apple . the taste of apple pie is incredible , but i can never get past the texture of the apple slices to actually enjoy it .","725273":"people around my neighborhood really don t care about the pandemic . there s still parties up the street every single weekend . i live in a relatively bad area though , so it comes to me as no surprise that no one knows how to act amongst all of . . this .","725274":"i don t have an official garden or anything like that unfortunately ! but just recently i did go out back and plant some surprise lily bulbs with chicken teriyaki ! they won t grow until next year , so it s pretty much just a waiting game . if i had it my way , if it were physically possible , i would have a massive garden full of all sorts of things . one area for flowers , and another for fruits and veggies ! image attached is not mine it s to show what type of lily we planted","725275":"not that i can ever recall ! maybe during winter if i wanted to play outside , i d have to wear a couple of layers of socks or a hoodie under my coat . but nothing unreasonable , i don t think .","725276":"plastic surgery is not for me . i don t personally like the concept of getting my natural appearance altered artificially . the thought of someone sculpting me with tools and flesh and fat makes me . . a little ill . i already sometimes don t recognize myself when i do simple new things with my hair , or wear different clothes . that can sometimes make me dissociative alone . so i couldn t imagine what going through plastic surgery would do to me mentally . however , however . i do support anyone who feels that they want to explore getting surgically done up ! it s your body , and your life , and ultimately your decision . people should be allowed to do with their bodies as they want , so long as it s nothing seriously harmful to them .","725277":"i would say so , yes ! i m in a really good mood today . it s friday , it s beautiful outside , i feel well rested . . nothing to not be happy about !","725278":"i don t have kids , and i am adamant on staying that way . and hell , i ve been adamant on that even since i was a kid myself ! the concept of having kids , whether through conceiving or through adoption is not at all appealing to me . having kids doesn t line up with any of my ideals in life . and i d never bring a child into my world , which is a world i ve not built around the concept of them and their future .","725279":"hmm . . nah , i m good . i m not trying to get a uti . i value my personal health all too much to participate .","725280":"my number one dream is to travel to different countries , such as japan . there s near endless videos and pictures online of all the neat things that are overseas . from something as simple as completely new flavors of typical candy we have in the us , to vending machines for cakes and pizzas ! well i guess i m only focusing on the food aspect . . there s a great many stores , cafes , hotels , and more that i d love to see as well .","725281":"i am dating ! and not currently searching .","725282":"it s hard to believe in forces that directly alter our realities i continously have a back and forth about this within myself . i feel . . maybe that i don t believe in destiny and karma in their root definitions . like , karma is supposed to be something good or bad happening as a direct result of a prior action , right ? and i mean not something as simple as someone committing crimes and getting the karma of being arrested . i mean that s more predictable . i m talking more or less two completely unrelated scenarios happening . for example , someone breaks a heart . they get their heart broken in the future . can we really believe that that s the universe s punishment ? it sounds all too . . coincidental . i think the concept of karma , or people getting what they ve earned is a comforting one . but it s hard to fully , believe in it all .","725283":"here s an accurate rendition of how it would likely go within minutes of me igniting the engine . . .","725284":"i learn best with a combination of watching and doing . it s easiest for me to learn how to do something if i watch it done first !","725285":"women s shoes especially fancy dress shoes are often created with the most impractical design . they re not made to accommodate the wearer for much activity other that swift , smooth , elegant footsteps . most particularly , the type of shoes cinderella was wearing . they re referred to as slippers because that s what they do slip . they aren t made with an ankle or over the foot strap , solely for the convenience of being able to slip the shoes on and off . that being said , it d be easy to lose one in fast paced activity , such as when she was running . sucker just pop ! slipped right off . there s nothing to keep it in place !","725286":"i am , absolutely ! i feel like i ve been waiting the whole year for these muggy hot temps to roll on out of here ! ! but finally , fall is here to stay and i m actually pretty excited to embrace these cooler temperatures . gives me more comfortable means to snuggle up in blankets ! ! plus , it s pretty calming to be able to go outside every day and see the leaves change yet another shade as they fall . fall is a month where a lot of nature dies and i m not always hype about it . but it s almost beautiful to watch , just knowing that it ll all come back and flourish next year !","725287":"super night vision would be so useful ! !","725288":"thank you for saying that ! ! i just have heard a lot from people in the industry and i know how easy it can be to be taken advantage of . but hey , no industry can control you if you re working freelanced !","725289":"if you put yourself up to it , i m sure you could accomplish a great many things ! who knows , there might be writing prompt competitions out there with just the thing in mind .","725290":"when i change the volume on anything with numerical value , it either has to end in a or a . if it s anything other than something ending in either number i get really bugged about it !","725291":"here you go !","725292":"heeere s salem ! he s a stray we ve been looking after since march . he stays in our yard and on our porch . came for the food , stayed for the infinite love and catnip","725293":"yes ! ! yes i do , and i have loved it ever since i watched it when i was a kid . being an adult on the internet , i have seen almost nothing but hate for it . and i never was able to understand that ! it was a really funny movie with plenty of catchy songs , memorable quotes , and good messages . what s terrible about any of that ? i loved that movie and loved it still when i rewatched it a few months ago !","725294":"one of the simplest things that make me happy is spending some time in my own backyard . i get to take in the warmth of the sun , feed local squirrels , and generally just feel at peace . well , unless it s a noisy day in the neighborhood . . but generally it s one of the smallest things that bring me happiness .","725295":"no , i don t think we should ever have to forgive someone who hurt us . the concept that we absolutely have to forgive and forget in order to heal is incredibly toxic . no one should have to put themselves at risk for being hurt again just to be the better person . the most healing thing one can do is forget our enemies to begin with . they are unimportant . it s better for an individuals personal health to move forward instead of looking back to strive for better .","725296":"it kind of does , doesn t it ? it seriously looks straight out of a cartoon ! also i wish this was my house unfortunately this is just a picture of a house i stumbled upon . i can dream , though . .","725297":"right now in the current pandemic , the hardest part of my job is being around the people . i feel concerned for my safety a lot of the time . corona cases are increasing in my state , and these freaking dumb dumbs i work around aren t wearing masks . so basically i have to avoid working in the section they occupy until they all leave , for my health and safety . it s hard to plan around them when i don t know their schedules .","725298":"i keep getting stuck on what is most desirable to me in a house . my aesthetics go from massive marble filled mansions to cutesy lil cabins and cottages surrounded in nature . i m super stuck ! but i guess i ll just post this i saw this picture years ago and every time i see it , it looks like such a dream . . like it comes straight out of a fairytale ! i think that kind of house would be the most desirable to me . a place that looks to be made out of love and magic .","725299":"i ve made a lot of progress within the last couple of years alone ! for example , i have massively worked on my former , i assure you tendency to become jealous . i no longer trouble myself with petty worries like that . it s irrational , irrelevant , and unfair to those around me . i know i m loved and cared for , and the truth in all of that is what matters most .","725300":". . . owe it to ourselves and others to be more kind , more accepting , more understanding , and more loving . hate fueled by ignorance and intolerance needs to be a problem of the past , so that we might move forward towards a brighter future . a future where our actions are not motivated by judgment and spite , but a future where we are all compassionate and empathize with one another .","725301":"su preeeeeeme all the way ! ! i have a really hard time with pepperoni , unfortunately . . i have traveled a long journey with it . i hated it , then i tolerated it for years . . then i went straight back into hating it . it just eugh i don t know ! it leaves behind so much grease on a pizza . and the taste just isn t appealing to me . meanwhile , if it s on a supreme , it s usually super small pieces that are easy to remove before baking . plus i tend to think the veggies on a supreme pizza are appealing in combination with the sauce veggies such as onions and bell peppers .","725302":"we control gadgets . inanimate objects are physically incapable of being in control of us . the only thing that manipulates what we do and how long we do something is attachment and addiction . the device itself isn t controlling us . it isn t forcing us to use it . it isn t holding us hostage . when someone gets really into using their tech , it s either because they re attached to their networks or they thrive from whatever they get out of it . when something gives you a grand amount of satisfaction , often like nothing else could , it s hard to put down . that s where the loss of control comes in solely within the individual . so basically , this notion that our devices control us absolves responsibility of the individual . it instead puts blame on the device for how much we use it . it s important to move the focal point to ourselves . and if necessary , make adjustments on just how reliant we are on these devices .","725303":"after since april ended , time from my perspective has been flying by scary fast . days feel more like hours . weeks feel more like days . months feel more like weeks . basically ever since may st , i feel like i ve blinked myself into the last stretch of the year ! it s something i ve been mad stressed over lately .","725304":"like . . which one do i prefer , or which one would i rather stave on existence from . . ? i ll answer both . food tastes better than water , so i surely prefer it . food again because you have a higher chance of survival if you try to exist just off of food . oh but you need water to survive get this . . soup ! soup broth contains mostly water ! ! it s water and flavor stock ! !","725305":"periwinkle ! well , at least that s one of my favorites . . i have several favorite colors from all across the spectrum . but periwinkle isn t one you always see , and being a person who really likes that color . . it s always a nice surprise when i do see it . i swear it s rarely ever used . . shame . it s a really calming color in my eyes .","725306":"here s my favorite youtubers , in no specific order imbrandonfharris

important to keep my head up and move on . rising above it is better than entertaining it , you know ? i ll be alright . thanks for hearing me out though , i appreciate it ! i m glad to hear you re doing okay ! hopefully you can feel better rested soon , and hopefully you re not stuck feeling drowsy the rest of the day . drowsy mondays aren t fun days !","725309":"aww but it s not christmas yet ! maybe when the holidays come , and if someone asked me again , i could share . i just usually don t take pictures of stuff like that because the family dinner table feels like a more personal place .","725310":"i love all colors of eyes ! ! i don t really get too picky about this because it s such a minute detail on someone . when it comes to the person s i love , all that matters in their eyes is that i m able to see how much love there is behind them . i love being able to see how a person feels through looking into their eyes , no matter what the color . though if you re asking what eye color the recipient has , well . . i have blue eyes !","725311":"i think it really all depends ! there is some people who put more work into their vehicle than others . there s most people , who stick with their stock setup and appearance on their vehicles . primarily because it s often seen as a financial luxury to go all out on revamping your car . those people you can t really tell much about ! not financial status , not much of anything ! however , if i see a chrome painted car with tinted windows and colored led lights i m gonna think wow , they must have a lot of money , they must be really well off , they must be passionate about their appearance and the vibes they give off . but i don t think i can read a person much further than that , just based off of their vehicle alone .","725312":"right now it s pm on the dot nope . scratch that , pm . darn . what time is it for you ? i m surprised to see so much timezone diversity among the people i follow , i kinda have to wonder what time zones the people who follow me are in !","725313":"dang . heck . i m gonna be honest , i m a little lost feeling . long story short , my supervisor who is thrice my age i hi hiiif that matters is starting rumors about me to other coworkers . i may not be a model employee , but i keep myself dutifully attached to my work and don t bother anyone . so why am i being subjected to grade school drama in my place of work . . ? ugh . enough about me . how are you today ?","725314":"honey crisp apple juice ! ! the store i used to get it from their brand stopped producing it though , so i haven t been able to have it for a really long time . it seems like they replaced it with gaia apple . . blegh . it s just not as good . honey crisp apple juice is the best kind , hands down .","725315":"i have always been more in favor of pizza rolls ! pizza bagels are so good but rrrrrrr it s always feels like they get really rough around the edges super easy . but pizza rolls are always bangin , even if you did accidentally overcook them . you can just scoop up the spilled out pizza guts with the shell and all s still good . nothing is lost .","725316":"i don t actively observe either sports , but i do appreciate the the precision and techniques used in boxing ! i recently picked up a comic on webtoon called the boxer and i m pretty into it . buuut my knowledge on the sport doesn t go very far .","725317":"i don t know sign language unfortunately . but if i did , i would never purposefully neglect to use it knowing that someone is deaf and would need to communicate that way . that s just cruel !","725318":"oh ? that s weird . is it being buggy ?","725319":"i have , only once that i can remember ! it wasn t on here , but on another platform tellonym ! i couldn t even tell you what it said because i genuinely don t remember . that was so long ago . .","725320":"from a moralistic standpoint , i don t really agree with it . i feel like it absolves the home owner of personal responsibility from their own messes . as someone who has worked in cleaning , i have seen this firsthand . essentially , once a person knows they have someone to come in and magically poof away the mess , they feel careless and free to be piggish . messes are a problem of the past to these people . they act more careless with their very own spaces because they know they no longer have to . they re paying someone else to care , after all . basically that s the kind of attitude these people who pay for personal cleaning services seem to carry . i just feel like it s important for a person to be responsible for what they ve done . like , why make a mess for someone else to fix ? so long as you re physically able , i think you not personal , i mean general you should clean your own messes . it keeps you active , and in healthy mindsets . it keeps you from becoming a slob that is reliant on helping hands to do work for you .","725321":"i am too ! i m

support you and your relationship ! one of my relationships started online , and i also am long distance with one of my partners currently . i genuinely wish you both the best love that transcends the boundaries and difficulties of distance are always worth nourishing .","725331":"loud noise , primarily","725332":"one of my favorite forms of self expression is with color themes ! i love websites that allow me to match up profile icons with theme colors . vent , carrd , tumblr , and even ask offer some of my favorite forms of self expression online . basically put , i like to express myself through themed aesthetics !","725333":"the last person i kissed is chicken teriyaki","725334":"it honestly depends on the lawyer ! there s some lawyers who are better at arguing a case than others . and of course with anything else , there s certain ones with expertise in varying areas . for example , some lawyers could specialize in defending clients who are accused of theft , or a client accused of murder . genuinely all depends on who you go to . if you are in serious trouble , i highly recommend doing personal research . not many of us here on ask . fm would be able to offer you the help you seem to need . um . good luck regardless !","725335":"i m not a lawyer , so this is knowledge i wouldn t have to be able to give ! i would highly recommend doing some poking around via google

drawing her eyebrows too high . she looked surprised .","725337":"local legend says , if you go out alone at night . . . you re going to get mugged at gunpoint , and then shot . okay that was kind of dark , totally more funny in my head than it is written out . i unfortunately don t have any interesting local legends or myths . . this kind of stuff happens to be commonplace here though . . . i don t mean to talk about it so casually , i m just numb to used to it i guess .","725338":"thank you sm ! !","725339":"i think it should go without saying . .","725340":"oh thank you ! ! i usually try to match my app color theme with my header image , but i kind of mismatched this time around with some spring colors . now that it s fall however , i m just really feeling like orange is the move . some

thank you for the follow i ll hit ya back !","725347":"saturdays are my favorite ! i don t work at all on the weekends , so saturday is my first leap into temporary freedom , independence , and fun . i don t ever schedule anything routinely for saturdays i m usually making plans the day of . but i do like to go out on the weekend , even if it s just on a nature walk . lately i ve been saving home projects for the weekend though .","725348":"i hope you re having a great weekend as well you really deserve it . so far my weekend has kind of been a mix of planned stuff , and a make plans as we go kinda deal . i went outside and planted those surprise lilies with chicken teriyaki finally ! and i got a gb sd card to back up apps with from my phone . i m not sure what to do with sunday , to be honest . but i wouldn t mind if it s just a day to relax .","725349":"okay idk how this got buried , i m sorry ! ! but i wanted to say that i m glad that you re back . you always send out really interesting questions , and you re always a joy to see in my ask box .","725350":"i just bought among us to play some time on steam .","725351":"i m pretty good actually , thank you for asking ! i ve had a semi eventful day , but i did a lot of fun stuff so i can t complain . how about yourself ? how are you holding up ?","725352":"i have a tendency to curse under my breath a whole lot more . which can be kinda risky because i can let it slip at work , , and i have a few times only to find out that there were still people there , , and even though they don t say anything i just know they heard me , , , , , it s not like i ever let anything more slip than the occasional fuck or shit . maybe a dash of dammit every so often . . but i still hate letting people witness me being frustrated

. he s one of my favorite youtube personalities !","725356":"nope ! i ve never really found cigarettes to be appealing . never even thought of trying them ! i hate the smell , i hate being around people when they smoke because it s hard to breathe . . i could never see that for myself .","725357":"you re absolutely right ! it s unfortunate but true too many people use the internet to be cruel for no reason .","725358":"obviously ! ! i think i ll just get it later on steam . i ll gift it to you too .","725359":"yes i have ! and actually it was my worst dental experience . i went to a dental office that essentially didn t give a crap about their patients . i wasn t numbed fully . and i wasn t even given laughing gas like i d requested . so i had to endure very fast cracking at and gouging out of my bottom wisdom teeth , full pain , no distraction . borderline traumatizing . oh also my bottom wisdom teeth were impacted , so can i say uhh most painful ? ? hm . yeah . never went back to that office .","725360":"me , finally ! i just got up not too long ago after about an hour of extra sleep . which i didn t even know i needed , by the way . .","725361":"i think that the scariest thing about the internet is how a lot of bad people use it as a safe haven . there s plenty of freaks who use places that allow them the guise of anonymity to indulge in illegal activity . most especially , i m talking about the dark web . like i mean , there s places there dedicated to trafficking , placing hits on people , hosting pictures videos of people dying or who are dead . . you get the idea . basically , the internet has some very dark corners that should never be visited .","725362":"making enemies out of your friends over a not so calm game of among us .","725363":"you can t extend your trust so easily . it s better to take precautions than to fix a huge mess later on because you accidentally misplaced your trust . sure , life is short and it s important to open up to people ! but i also feel it s important not to give and give and give so soon . certain people are hard to get a read on . your troubled stories can become someone else s jokes and gags at their next meet up with their real friends . that stuff sucks .","725364":"all lies are bad lies . if you keep on sprinkling in lies everywhere instead of the truth , you general may even begin to have a hard time telling what s real and what s fabricated . letting little lies slip out every so often is a very slippery slope . plus , if the lies are so little , then how bad could the truth really be ? it s better to just be honest . you ll have a lot of mess to clean up later if you fabricate every other thing . .","725365":"in my opinion or i should say my experiences , it s easier to recover from hurtful words than it is from being physically hurt . words cause mental impact that can heal over very short time . being physically hurt leaves behind marks that remind you of that moment for a while .","725366":"oof . just one thing , are you sure ? how about eeeeeeuh . . everything . haha . ha . okay i know that doesn t count , so . . i guess what i d like to change the most about family is their level of understanding . just because i feel like the majority of my family is content living a life of bias and ignorance .","725367":"no , but i really do wish i did . unfortunately with my current living situation , there s not really any room to conveniently and safely for that matter put one up in the room . but when i move , it s one of the first furnishings i want to invest in for the bedroom .","725368":"i absolutely know what is meant when people ask this , but . . i always just imagine a person going outside and shoving their face into a pile of leaves on the ground and giving a biiiiiiig sniff . but seriously yes , i do . i love the smell of the outdoors in fall . it s kind of sad to see everything withering away , but the smell of fallen leaves can be so relaxing . especially if accompanied with a little bit of rain .","725369":"when i was a teenager , i was the quiet but edgy type . i was a loner , i stuck to myself , i had interests virtually no one could relate to besides my few nerdy friends who liked anime , i was big into creepypasta characters for a while there . . anyways that was my early teen years around . i made significant changes in my personality and character from late and onwards . i feel that this was my biggest development period as a teen , because i grew confidence and bravery until those were my stronger points . i dealt with a lot of rough things around that period that my newfound strength helped me fight through .","725370":"good luck would always be welcome in my life . it seems like for a good handful of things ,

likes what !","725376":"ohh i think i know what you re talking about . i just looked it up , yep ! the black bags of popcorn , kind of potato chip bag sized . i ve only ever had white cheddar and i love it . i didn t even know there was other flavors !","725377":"nope ! it s never really been a concern for me . i know some people are allergic to certain kinds of materials , or have generally sensitive skin to some types . but i ve never had a problem , so i never usually pay attention !","725378":"i always hesitate to answer these kinds of questions with anything other than chicago style cheese deep dish pizza ! ! my favorite place is beggars pizza in chicago . i don t live there , so i haven t had it in a while . but oh my gosh what i wouldn t give for a slice .","725379":"thank you !","725380":"nnnope ! we re probably not going to . one year we left pumpkins out and a rotten group of teenage boys threw one against the window . we ve not done much to decorate the house for holidays since then . . ! but i do want to set up some halloween themed lights in my bedroom at the very least .","725381":"no , i really don t think so . i find peace and calm in the truth . the only reason people who don t know the truth about something are blissful , is because they have yet to find the truth . once they do , their whole world can collapse .","725382":"nope , it s not something that s for me ! i don t like the idea of making something bite a hook and get it painfully stabbed into its mouth just to pull it out where it can t breathe and oggle it . and i know that there s fish friendly bobbers but still . ehhh it s not for me .","725383":"criminals are made . there s a lot of psychologically challenging events a lot of criminals go through before they start committing crimes . i don t say that in any way to pity criminals or justify their actions , by the way . it s just the most typical case scenario .","725384":"talk shit about me i m gonna find where you live and i ll clip through your house . put you in a cart on the border to skyrim , cause that s what you get for running your mouth i love it because it s funny to hear todd howard threaten to clip through my house . or put me in the cart from the beginning of skyrim because like . . that was the meme for a while there . idk i love the entirety of liar liar , the whole track is gold . here s the link https youtu . be mgfxrsnzunq","725385":"i don t know who that is , but those are awfully big claims to be making with no source . and on anon too . don t you think that s harmful ?","725386":"yeah , i do . firstly because prejudices make it very easy for a good handful of people to just be hateful on sight . but also because it s possible to witness someone doing something utterly awful the first time you see them .","725387":"hell yeah , i love corn !","725388":"i m sorry to hear that i hope you feel better soon !","725389":"you re welcome ! have yourself a lovely day night .","725390":"i just said , i m not sending you any . you are getting notified that i am posting them because you have poll notifications turned on . turn them off , and you will no longer receive notifications for those .","725391":"i m not sending you polls . i never send anyone any kind of thing i post on here . i post them and move on . if you are , however , referring to you getting notifications that i have posted polls , there s a switch in the notification settings to turn those off .","725392":"definitely a poisonous snake . you know , wolves are actually freaking gigantic . . idk what happened or how i thought this , but for most of my life i thought they were much smaller than they actually are . they re very large animals , and plus ? they move in packs . i d be dead for sure if i ran into a wolf . but with a snake , with its size , i feel like it d be much easier to survive an encounter . running isn t recommended if you re super close , but if necessary one would be easy to sling away or kill . at least much easier than it would be to defend yourself against wolves .","725393":"death of loved ones , including the animals i care for . i don t need any more loss this year hell nooo , no thank you . though i suppose that s more of a perpetual anxious worry than a fear . . hm . something that i m really afraid of is sleep paralysis . i ve only ever had it a couple of times , very briefly . and they can be some of the most terrifying things to experience in a tired state .","725394":"i have and will continue to always promise my friends a place to be listened to , understood , and loved . even if i don t get back to them right away , my inbox is a few taps away . i always want my friends to feel like they have someone they can come to . that s incredibly important to me .","725395":"i will always trust my friends more than my parents . it s the way it has always been , because my friends have always been much more reliable and caring .","725396":"you should never share anyone s . . . phone number address full legal name secrets trauma personal feelings events embarrassing facts aaaaand i mean basically anything they wouldn t put out there themselves . it s important to know boundaries and not overstep . if someone confides in you for personal things , don t take advantage of that . trust cannot be easily earned back as easily as it can be taken away .","725397":"full offense ? too bad , i don t care . this is my profile . i get to do with it what i want . what you want sincerely has the same level of significance as a grain of sand to me . and considering the next question you sent in , you don t even deserve the chance to participate . i m not going to free an hour of my valuable time just because some homunculus on anon wants free jack off material . bottom line , my profile , my life , my time , my rules . you saying you wanna means not a single thing to me . goodbye .","725398":"i ve seen a few other users take on similar concepts , and i ve definitely considered it . one i remember seeing on a few profiles is honesty week , which actually might work better for me instead . if i m going to host something for the userbase to engage with , i want to be sure the amount of time is fair ! an hour is much too short for both myself and anyone who wants to participate . i want to be sure i ll have the time to get back to every question participating in that , just so no one feels left out if that makes sense . basically , i m considering setting up honesty week instead of honesty hour to really maximize engagement with the community ! when i do figure out how i want to set it up , i ll make an announcement post on the weekend prior . and if anyone misses that post , i ll have my display name set up to remind anyone who comes to my profile what s going on . so do keep a look out ! i ll absolutely work on this soon now that i see there s some interest in me doing it too . i might even start it this upcoming monday ! anyways , thanks for letting me know .","725399":"posting this because it s very solid advice . don t keep things hobbies people around that will limit you from your full potential and full happiness .","725400":"yes , and no . or , rather . . yes and then for most people there s a stopping point in that maturing . allow me to explain . the more we age , the more we are able to experience ! relationships , exploration , individuality , independence , you name it . we gain a lot of knew knowledge with new experiences . and most life changing experiences happen as we age through adulthood . but for a lot of people there s a stunt in their mental growth and maturity when they reach a certain point . it can be a lack of willingness to do new things , or a level of comfort with where a person is at . or , a complete disinterest in working on things that make us better . ugh i could have put this more simply i think , and when i re read your question i keep thinking i m going about this the wrong way . my bad ! i think what i m trying to say is yes , you do mature a lot more as you age . but there s a lot of people who aren t willing to be mature about certain things about themselves in order to keep maturing .","725401":"i ve only recently heard of blackish , but i don t know anything about it . and i never really sat and watched america s got talent , but i ve seen snippets . but since i ve not ever avidly watched either , i don t think i can answer with much more than this .","725402":"we find comfort in self assurance . the concept of being utterly wrong can make some people spiral , because they most cling to what they believe in . and for those people , in the end , who are they without their beliefs ? i think that many people are just afraid of being wrong . whether that s from trauma or just wanting to feel confident in the knowledge they ve found or something else entirely is totally dependant on the person .","725403":"i don t care for sports one way or the other . never really interested me !","725404":"this is gonna be a sucky answer , so sorry in advance ! but my high school couldn t really afford to provide its student body with any real extracurricular activities .","725405":"not to be cheesy or anything . but all i want for christmas is to be able to spend more relaxed quality time with those i love . this year has been full of so much death and loss emotional loss , physical loss , financial loss , just . . loss of all kinds . i just want to be able to spend the holidays cherishing who i still have . and hopefully being cherished back . i want to spend time with my partners , my friends , my pets , my neighborhood squirrels . . basically all of the life left that i cherish in this world is what i want this christmas .","725406":"in my area , there s still a lot of precautions being enforced , and thousands upon thousands of people here have still been out of a job . along with that , many still haven t been able to receive compensation from the state . plenty of people going poor . i haven t kept up on how many cases there s been here for a while so i m not sure actually of the current state of the virus here . . but we are still in an extremely precautionary state . don t get me wrong , i absolutely see why . it s just dreadful that so many people are being sank into poverty . .","725407":"okay . oh my god . let me tell you , i m actually ecstatic that you sent me this . i m going to be honest , i thought that i had fever dreamed that movie existing . i watched it when i was probaby . . ? ? ? and i completely forgot the title of it , so i genuinely thought the movie was a part of my overactive child imagination . but when i read the title in your ask , it hit me ! that movie uuuugh . my favorite ghost was the woman who was covered in lacerations , carrying a knife , surrounded in whispers if i remember correctly . i don t remember if she had a name so lemme look into this for a second . doo dee doo doing some research the angry princess ! ! ah , yes . one of my first bisexual awakenings i had something of a crush on her . i also just really felt for her backstory and felt bad for her . i might not have wholly understood or resonated with her , considering i was a literal child who probably shouldn t have been allowed to watch this movie . but anyways . yeah . wow that unlocked a lot of memories .","725408":"hmm . . i usually don t crave anything particularly weird ! i have pretty standard tastes in food . or so i think . . ? well , actually when i think about it , one thing people say is weird is how i like my favorite subway sandwich . i usually get a chicken bacon ranch , on toasted wheat bread just a little crispy . inside , i get ranch , mustard , red onion , and pickles . i haven t eaten subway in . . oh shit i don t think i ve eaten there at all this year ! but i just remembered the almost disgusted looks the person making my sandwich would give . one person even asked me and chicken teriyaki he d get virtually the same thing , but with different veggies is it even good that way .","725409":"i remember being asked this one a while ago , and my answer was i don t ever watch musicals . but . . since then , i have officially watched exactly one musical , and it s the only musical i need to watch . cats the original stage musical , not the film is that musical . i loved the songs , i loved the choreography , i loved the costume designs especially the design for rum tum tugger . i watched it when i was in maine in august visiting my partner ! i fell in love with it . i don t exactly seek out musicals , because they re not my thing . but i don t at all regret watching cats .","725410":"i ve got a little bit of a busy evening ahead of myself , so i wanted to share some things before i get to it ! . i m dedicating some time later to sitting down and answering questions . if there s anything let me add , within reason . . you want to know , ask away ! even if i don t get to it right away , i seldom ever swipe away questions . . i have some older questions to get to still as well , so please don t think i ve forgotten ! since i got back on the vip program , i ve been able to keep track of how many questions i m answering in a week vs how many i rack up . sometimes i purposely wait to answer more to ensure that there s plenty saved up to keep my profile active with more than just polls ! that being said . . . . so many of you ask really intriguing , really engaging , really thought provoking questions . and i do intend on getting to them all ! i feel that questions of these types are very important to dedicate time to answering thoroughly and properly , so this is why they might not be posted yet . i apologize for the wait on those . basically , i want to reward intriguing questions with intriguing answers and keep the fun going ! so don t let the prospect of me not answering them asap get you down . anyways , thank you for reading ! let s keep ask . fm alive with engaging attitudes and intriguing questions .","725411":"i followed you back ! thanks for sending a bunch of questions by the way . hope you have a good day ! !","725412":"i don t know who that is , ,","725413":"yes ! ! i was just talking to chicken teriyaki about this earlier . i keep on making more and more haphazard typing errors . i think it has to do with the fact that my nails are shorter right now , and my typing methods i m usually used to aren t exactly working with my keyboard . . i might need to change the spacing in my keyboard until my thumb nails at least grow back in a lil more .","725414":"hahaha none i don t really like them . but i m rather responsive to being offered a square of tiramisu , if that counts .","725415":"i m most likely not going to wear it out , but i have several costumes to choose from ! i could be a cat , i could be an angel , i could be a lil devil . . there s plenty to choose from . and i haven t even gotten to wear any of these yet past trying them on .","725416":"i don t feel like there s any kind of secret to having healthy and happy partnerships ! i just feel like there s things that are common knowledge that too many of us neglect . and whether or not that s a lack of care or a lack of interest is dependant on the person neglecting their love and love life . i think that what you need for a happy and healthy partnership or partnerships is finding a person you really connect with . an honest connection truly helps all that other good stuff that a relationship needs to flourish , come naturally ! these needs are love , compassion , care , kindness , understanding , and trust ! these things can t be forced . if there s no honest connection first , there s no sense in the rest .","725417":"my dreams are often so sporadic and out there that it s really hard to break down into a list exactly what s joggin up in the ole noggin while i sleep . but i can try and find some general themes that are common in my dreams animals my dogs and the neighborhood squirrels relationships things i m anxious about during consciousness general fears general hopes and aspirations games and shows i like at the moment i m struggling to think of anything else that commonly is a theme of my dreams . but i feel like it s really normal for a lot of people to have dreams like those .","725418":"i have three siblings , and i m the youngest . i want to talk about my eldest sibling because honestly ? she s pretty cool . we aren t terribly close , but she had helped me through a lot when i was discovering myself and exploring my identity . she was the only person in my family who sat and talked to me and tried to relate to me . also , she s really helpful and caring . when the pandemic reached our state , she sewed everyone in our family custom face masks !","725419":"i ve gotta pass on this one . there s nothing wrong with your question , i just don t like to dig things up that were already resolved ! i try not to dwell too much on things i ve already healed from . so i choose to not share . .","725420":"spending time feeding my neighborhood squirrels !","725421":"as of right now , nothing particular is planned ! i d love to at least dress up and do a cute photo shoot in a few of the costumes i have stored away . . but i might just binge some favorite halloween classics with chicken teriyaki","725422":"that the privacy of the people never has mattered and as far as i can see from a cynical but realistic standpoint it never will . i m pretty stressed about the government trying to make personal privacy and internet security a political issue .","725423":"last weekend . . actually i forgot , let me think . loading , please wait okay ! i remembered now . saturday , i went out with chicken teriyaki to do some shopping ! we got groceries done , and a little bit of thrift shopping done for clothes . we both found some really cool brand new original tags included clothes at insanely discounted prices . sunday , we went to home depot and got some trowels to plant our surprise lily bulbs with ! we re going to plant them soon , and they ll lay dormant in the earth until next year . that s all i can really remember that stands out the most . it was a packed weekend with lots of time spent out and about . but you know ? even if it was just routinely stuff , i had a lot of fun !","725424":"anything with more than legs is a massive red flag for me lmao . spiders ?

everything invested in you changes mind , body , and spirit . as we age , we all experience a plethora of different things that tailor us into who we become . gaining friends , making enemies , loving , losing these are some of the biggest things that change what s on the inside as we grow . and as long as a person keeps on exploring new things , and new possibilities , i truly believe there s no stop in growth . some people out of ignorance choose not to search for internal growth , however , and that s the unfortunate disconnect . but that s them . for me , however , i ll always consider myself a work in progress . up until my very death .","725431":"there s plenty of things people could accuse you of that are illegal . theft , murder , you name it . that doesn t mean that there shouldn t be laws against these things , solely because of the fact that someone could lie and misrepresent you to the face of the law . these laws are in place to encourage others to abide by them , and to keep people secure . the law itself is not the issue , the people who would supposedly be accusatory that i i m assuming you via your apparent self projection had broken the law would be the problem . also , side note but still very related . . how long are you gonna persist on sending this to people ? ? i swear through any account i ve ever had on here , i have had the misfortune of you landing in my inbox . and each time i always see you pulling this argument . no ! be done . seek help .","725432":"in a vague , general sense this is my love language words of affirmation , words of praise , quality time , physical touch more specifically , this is how i show my love their favorite perfume sprayed on love letters , poems from the heart , time dedicated to ensuring they re okay , their favorite cup of tea on a bad day , their favorite candle lit scent plugin diffusing so they come back to a comforting surprise , so much affection and praise , always being there to listen whenever it s needed , positive encouragement , , there s so many ways i like to show my love , but these are some !","725433":"i don t make a habit out of being indecent in public so , i m good . . thanks . . ? ?","725434":"of course , it s no trouble ! honestly it doesn t help that they didn t update their emails for a while to not say the removed methods for earning coins . overall it s pretty

copies of this show and a lot of others from its time without spending tons on those dvd box sets .","725437":"right now , i guess the weirdest thing idk kfjfhf in my room has to be the mouse i rescued last night ! we re waiting for the right time to be able to release her . i want to ensure that she s not severely injured and will be fine on her own . i wish i could tell you an actual thing , like an object . i m struggling to think of if i have any weird items . . ! hang on . . oh ! well maybe this counts . yesterday i bought a necklace from a local thrift store . the charm is a turtle with rainbow tiles in its shell , making the most suspicious shit eating grin . and underneath the turtle it just says trouble . it was too ominous yet cute to not buy ! like this might curse me but

crates full of amazon returns . he was buying them to pick through for anything good to resell . it was pretty interesting , but it seems like a really risky move just for the concept of making more back than you are breaking even .","725442":"i d consider going to get some then . . !","725443":"thank you , that means a lot to me ! a lot of people seem to like them . i just do them so much

pie , the texture is so gross . i ve never been able to get over the texture of sodden baked apples . cherry pie however is delicious and sweet and just a little tart but it s perfect

who are always around talk to you often . and . . ehhh i m kinda not vibing with that . it feels very pressure y and borderline unrealistic to expect a person to be available to you all the time . i just see friend or not friend . nothing more specific than that , really . i have a good handful of friends that i m relatively close to . can t precisely count but , i love em even if we don t talk every day .","725483":"my favorite homework was always no homework at all . i don t think i ve ever met a single person who likes liked receiving homework .","725484":"that suuucks i m sorry to hear

was asked something in relation to a giant micro person kink macrophilia . like , the guy kept trying to get me to fuel his fantasies of being stepped on or captured by a giantess . asking things like what would you do if you were suddenly much taller , like a giant and what would you do if people tried climbing on you and would you use your size to crush these people . . stuff like that . it was super weird . maybe not even my weirdest questions ever on this hellish app . . but definitely pretty up there as far as i can remember .","725486":"yes , i do ! chicken is one of my favorite foods . i like it battered , i like it fried , i like it grilled , i like it in soup , i like it in a sandwich . . really it s a valuable piece of produce . you can make so many different things meals with

makes me feel more calm is the stars .","725491":"i don t have any tattoos actually ! i have always pondered on the idea of getting one , but i m forever stuck on what i d even get . and if it would

recently made your account and i m talking within the last month . . . the honest truth is that you signed up at the wrong time . it used to be much easier to earn coins until just recently . staff changed the coin earning game to make it much more of a challenge . you used to be able to earn per every direct question of yours that someone asked you . now the only ways to earn coins is by people gifting you them , you watching ads , or you buy them with real money , which i d never recommend . it kinda sucks , but i suppose it levels the leader boards with a little more fairness . maybe it was a move to stop people from cheating the system . . ?","725498":"oh , summer is over ! it s fall right now . and there s actually quite a lot i plan on reading staying caught up on . here s a small

being bigoted are definitely quick ways to make me hate a person . outside of that , more direct to me , i think any unnecessary judgment of my person would make me want nothing to do with someone

feel like i either have bouts of being ticklish , or it depends on who is tickling me . this is a sudden dilemma i just recently discovered . i had always thought i was extremely ticklish because when

i have been really blissful but relaxed when i ve smoked . but there was times where i had a bad trip . it all depends on what i choose to do and who i m with . i ve thought about trying mushrooms , but it s never gone any further past that .","725518":"i have been , yeah ! when we re in the peak of winter here , snow storms can get pretty crazy . i ve never been stuck in one , but there was a time where i had to go outside and shovel in one . numerous times in the same storm . i had to make a path outside for my pups to be able to go to the bathroom . i had to use a cardboard box and a broom at first because the shovel was across the yard . . i wonder if i can expect something similar this coming winter . . .","725519":"that s really not good ! if you re able to i d recommend taking note of how you re feeling how often when you get cramps , and speak to your doctor about it .","725520":"i ll hit you up with some questions if you hit me up with some back ! you know , if you don t mind . .","725521":"one of my biggest questions for the universe is how long do we last ? how long will we human beings , all of everyone s collective beginnings and ends exist ? will there be a time where everything that ever was for us collapsed ? will there ever be a time where our history is unearthed and discovered by some other species ? i just have to know if there s an end to life s story !","725522":"o o i m getting an alarming amount of shoutouts about people having cramps . for the last couple weekends now , i ve gotten this ! i m starting to get worried . . if a warm compress , or pressing a pillow onto your abdomen for a while doesn t help , you might want to get checked out . chronic cramping can be linked to many serious issues . of course if this is a different person than

threatened among many other things . this is vague , but this is all i can see . specifically speaking of the us by the way","725525":"hey thanks , real kind if you to put that out there ! it takes a lot to not be reactive with your emotions , or numb out certain things . the biggest part for me is reminding myself , you can t please everyone , happiness is simply pleasing yourself . focus your attention on what really matters , not hateful people . they re not worth it . . stuff like that ! but it takes time to truly believe in that mindset . i wish you the best of luck in finding that for yourself . take care .","725526":"i don t let people get on my nerves . if someone acts a certain way , they don t deserve to be around me . those kinds of people aren t worth the time or energy to entertain . so i guess to fully answer your question , it would take a lot for something to actually upset me .","725527":"the hilight of my week was one of my goodnight calls with my partner ! we had one of our longest calls yet , which almost ended in him falling asleep . ugh his sleepy voice is so cute ! !","725528":"it s not up to me to correct another person s perspective of myself , nor is it ever mandatory that i prove myself to anyone . it would be a complete waste of my time to try and pacify everyone s empty criticisms . no one on here knows me past a very surface level . and if you want to weigh in on how logical you think i am with the bare minimum information you have on me . . that sounds like a you problem . not a me problem .","725529":"if you feel that you ve accidentally hurt your friend , the only right thing to do is talk about it ! communication is key for silent issues such as these . make some time to talk to your friend about it . bring it up and ask if you hurt them . hear them out if it comes to be that you did , and see if you can work it out from there .","725530":"nope ! an apology doesn t heal someone from losing someone they love . the only thing that heals a person from that is time !","725531":"i hope your friday is going well ! take care of yourself and especially if you plan on going out be safe and sanitary ! i hope this friday jumpstarts you into a great weekend regardless .","725532":"oh , do i have something to share for this question . . well . me and my partner were at the mall and we were walking about trying to find something to eat . i hadn t had a chicken panini in a while , and this one healthy food stall was selling them sooo we ate there . the food and drinks tasted off . waaay off . later , did we both find out through hours of sickly suffering that it was so bad that we got food poisoned . it hit me first , and the worst . it hit him in the middle of the night . it would not be an exaggeration to say that we both felt like we were dying .","725533":"failure used to dissuade me from trying again . but where i am right now , i feel that failure neither dissuades or encourages me . i get encouragement from knowing that i ll be better off once something is taken care of and over with !","725534":"nope ! but there was a while there where tiger king was all i was hearing about . i didn t know why , but i didn t really bother making time to find out !","725535":"i m not the best person to ask about this , seeing as i m not an emo guy . or really an emo person in general but . people who call themselves emo typically revolve their lifestyle , personality , appearance , and fashion sense around emocore . what comes to mind as emocore things are angst , moodiness , the color black , softer guitar based rock . . . that s all i know ! i can t speak for everyone who identifies with emocore but that s what the general concept has been based around iirc .","725536":"overall not too bad . the tiniest bit tired , but it s kinda on me for staying up late .","725537":"because of lore olympus more than anything , i would have to become persephone goddess of spring . i would want to use my powers to cause plant life to flourish .","725538":"i feel like it would almost be more upsetting of a fact if you keep count ! ! when i was single , i wouldn t keep track of stuff like that . i d just let it go and move with the passage of time . and eventually i found love again . don t lose hope !","725539":"i don t believe anyone needs makeup necessarily . but doing makeup is less about needing it and more about doing it because it s a hobby ! and it adds a little glam to your look . it emphasizes one s favorite features . makeup is actually really fun , even though i seldom ever do it past lipgloss lipstick . i can clearly see the joy people get from doing it having it done . and that kind of joy is never wrong .","725540":"oh , no no . i haven t been to a salon for a full cut in a long time . not since i was in th grade . i did however go to a salon to get my bangs done the first time . past that i trimmed them myself !","725541":"i wish i could get mine legally changed , but i don t think there s any laws passed here that indicates the legal recognition of nonbinary folks . shit fucks . it s really isolating .","725542":"thanks , you too ! we re another day closer to friday . let s push through this !","725543":"francis forever , by mitski . my partner sang it to me while holding my hands as we sat on his living room floor my last night visiting there . it s a song that has a special place in my heart , and i know all of the lyrics to it . even now just thinking about it i m tearing up .","725544":"things for me are going pretty okay at the moment ! i m just trying to vibe through my shift . i really hope you and your loved ones are managing to stay safe and be well ! sounds like a scary situation to be in .","725545":"nope ! i ve never really had to , since i ve not ever had much change . i usually get leftover money in bills , and any change i do get usually gets spent on the next thing paid in physical money .","725546":"i don t think that s outwardly fake , no . if anything i feel like it depends on the reason you re doing it . . ? or maybe you don t have a reason for it . i feel like social adaptation is often inadvertently something we all do . it s almost a knee jerk reaction for us to be people pleasers in our social lives , because pleasing others keeps them around . and keeping people you like around pleases you . overall , it would be one thing if you were doing it to be spiteful to these different people behind their backs and act like they re strangers when you re with others . however if you re doing it as a natural response , or to keep others happy , i don t necessarily think that s fake . you re taking in the information around you and adapting based on what you come up with in that case .","725547":"i ve really only ever been able to sleep on a sofa by passing out from exhaustion . sofas are definitely not comfortable . i always wake up in pain if i ve slept on one . gonna have to go ahead and choose a bed here . the only couch i d ever be able to fall asleep on comfortably is the big comfy couch .","725548":"you re on anon so idk who this is , but thank you !","725549":"none ! i don t at all fancy them .","725550":"the one that eats at me the most is the concept of the afterlife . i m stuck on what to think about it . because while i hope there is one , it all feels so . . impossible and impractical ? i don t mean to clash with anyone s religious beliefs , so don t take any personal offense , but i just get eaten up by the idea that this is it . that all we have is one go , and we fade out forever .","725551":"i m sorry to hear ! have you tried pressing a pillow to your abdomen ? usually when i have stomach cramps pressure using something soft like a pillow or a plush helps after a while . i feel like i gave this answer to someone else who had the same problem recently . sorry ! it s all i ve got to suggest .","725552":"i feel as though it s highly inconsiderate because that s basically sibling hopping . it s usually what someone does when they re confused on what they really want . plus i mean , it s almost an insult to your ex . she ll have to sit there miserable watching you court her sister , who she ll likely have a falling out with because she is with her ex . so not only will your ex have lost a partner , but also she would have lost a sister . that s pretty low honestly .","725553":"my instagram is in a button on my carrd . it s linked on my profile !","725554":"it kinda is though so i feel your pain . i ll do my best to explain stuff if you ever need help on something specific .","725555":"aw heck that s sad unfortunately they re really fragile . but i hope he s doing okay too ! and i m hoping to find more of these cool little blue guys to take pictures of . i ve not taken enough pictures of my interests outdoors , and i need to get on that .","725556":"barbecue !","725557":"no ty","725558":"i m sorry to hear that ! i might be late to this , seeing as i just woke up . but usually what i do when i get a stomach ache is hold something soft against my stomach . like a really fluffy pillow , or a big stuffed animal . and i make sure to apply steady central pressure to the object on my stomach . after some time passes , i usually feel better . i hope you re doing okay !","725559":"mine ? no . but the tears of my enemies however . . .","725560":"you know what ? allergies are a freaking bummer ! it s only within the last few years that i ve started to suffer from seasonal allergies . like one spring , i just suddenly stumbled into sniffly nose booger hell . and i never have been able to enjoy spring and summer the same . . . i used to never have these problems . it s like eventually i just unlocked them . even as summer is ending , my allergy problems are fussing .","725561":"isn t he ? ? aaaaa i wish he came out of his shell . it has been a really long time since i d seen one that was alive and healthy . before if i d see them at all , they d be crushed or there would only be an empty husk of a shell . i m bummed that when i finally stumbled upon a live one that i didn t get to take pictures of him fully .","725562":"thank you so much it means a lot honestly . i hope that you re able to find the prosperity in love that you deserve . i m rooting for you on that ! also , i live with . is in maine and i visited him last month for a week actually so that was fun we met irl for the first time ! ! . aaand lives a city over from me .","725563":"yesterday i took sone pictures of a cool snail i found ! i used to see these lil guys all the time when i d play in the dirt as a kid . but i haven t seen one in over ten years . . until yesterday . i picked him up and put him over in the dirt because he was in the driveway . i was worried about him getting ran over . anyways , after all these years of being curious about them i learned what they are . they re blue dark bodied glass snails ! you can t see very well in the picture , but his lil slimy self hiding in the shell is blue . yep . a blue snail . i think they re so neat .","725564":"this is such a cute question for you to ask ! ! i ll describe them a bit , using my emoji key for the sake of their individual comfort levels . . . , he him . he s like . . a true cryptid on the inside but is a total teddy bear on the outside . he has an interest in weird phenomenon and strange aesthetics . very tech savvy to nearly the point of obsession but i love him for it . quite honestly he s the smartest person that i ve ever known , and i ve been fortunate enough to know him for nearly ten years now ! ! he s on the quiet side and won t say much unless prompted , but when he speaks his feelings you can feel it in your heart that he means it deeply and truly . he has a lot of love to give and i m fortunate enough to be the sole recipient of that love . and i m lucky that i get to know him more than anyone else . he s golden hearted . , he him . the most charasmatic and fun person on the face of the planet . definitely outwardly flamboyant and proud of it and super cute for it . he s got so many stories and jokes to tell , and always references his favorite interests . like , even down to obscure specific quotes from songs or shows . he has a memory that seems to record everything , it s honestly impressive . and as big as his brain is , his heart is ten times the size with how sweet he is . he s truly a romantic person always links me songs that make him think of me , makes me collages based off of my aesthetics to match with the selfies i send him , and helps me any way he can . he s so sweet . , he him . fighting game enthusiast with every single cell in his body . he s all about street fighter , tekken , and mortal combat . actually , he s been to a couple of fighting game tournaments this year alone to participate and go head to head with some of the top local players . but outside of his passion for the fgc and fighting games in general , he s a person full of love but shrouded in mystery . our relationship is much more casual out of space","725565":"they them ! thank you for asking , and for asking so respectfully","725566":"personally i altogether feel the same age that i do physically ! a lot of people can easily pin down what they feel like mentally , but i overall can t think of a way to answer . because , what really makes out mental age ? does it have to do with interests ? your personality type ? your level of intellect ? that s all so complicated xkshdhhs i just know i m me . and my body is . i don t think my core interest mindsets have changed much in the past few years maybe not even since i was . but i ve gained a lot of knowledge and insight on the world since then , and that all makes me feel mentally aged enough . this was a really good question ! but maybe some day i can come up with a more conclusive answer to it , and not think too deeply on it jdhshs","725567":"i can only see so much from your profile picture , but i want to sayyy . . maybe ? i dunno i m bad at this","725568":"yikes i didn t even know he tested positive until just now when i looked it up . i hope he recovers swiftly .","725569":"i m definitely not perfect , so there s plenty of choices i ve made in my life that i m not the happiest with . but if my mind lingers on the past forever , how will i ever move forward ? i m not the happiest with my life choices , but that s okay . i still have a long life ahead of me to focus on ! and that s what keeps me going the potential that the future brings .","725570":"you too ! take care and be well .","725571":"love has many purposes ! first it s important that we separate the words love and romance if we are going to grasp any base understanding , however . because while romance can be motivated by love , the two aren t the same ! love by itself is to feel intense care for something or someone . i feel like the purpose of love itself is to be an influence on one s whole life . love connects us to the places we live , the locations we favor , the people we make our friends , those we choose to be partnered with , etc . most of the choices that we make revolve around it . love is a feeling that helps us find out what we want to surround ourselves with , and it helps us know what makes us ultimately happy . do i feel like love of any kind should be the only guiding compass in our subset of emotions ? no . but i do feel like it plays one of the most significant roles in choice making and path taking . we are a curious species , brought into this world to give and receive over and over again until we are done . with love influencing so much , it s one of the key elements that make that cycle continue .","725572":"i don t vote on polls comparing people . it feels really rude and unnecessary to me . just my opinion ! plus it s more often than not that people related polls are having their pictures used unknowingly , and that s a whole other weird vibe . just ehh . i ll pass . . .","725573":"i m never not tired","725574":"well , i wouldn t say i have more . i m just out here talking u u not doing anything special ! but , thank you anyways . .","725575":"i m kind of curious about the new batman movie that s coming out , actually ! the batman , which is set to come out in . robert pattinson will be taking on the role as batman . having only ever seen him in twilight , i m highly intrigued by the fact that he ll be playing a gritty dark superhero . in the trailer i hardly even recognized him !","725576":"thank you !","725577":"oh i didn t know that s what you meant , i m sorry ! thank you so much , i appreciate your compliment ! to answer your question , i basically just looked in the mirror one day and said , you know what , i m kind of alright . but also honestly , i only set my name that way because other words i was coming up with wouldn t neatly line up on the top of my base text . for example , i tried a n g e l because i thought it was a cute way to sign my asks via my name . but the l kinda gets in the way . and forget about baby angel . . look at what mess comes out a n g e l . i wish that we could make superscript letters for the whole alphabet ! it would let me make so many cute designs","725578":"i m not sure what this ask is supposed to mean , to be honest . . . nothing happened me

week ! let s start this one off on a good note","725580":"i m going to try and get some rest . it s been a really good day ! i spent some time out , going around to a few different stores to get stuff

right now , but i m about to be making up for that soon i m glad to know that you re doing well . hope you have a good week !","725582":"nope ! considered it , but never did . i was logical and kept cool headed as best as i could . i try not to ever act rash .","725583":"i could never see myself eating bugs . i know in some places it s popular , almost like a delicacy . but with all due respect it s too gross for me , i won t do it . even if it is technically something you can do healthily . no thank youuu .","725584":"in all scientific technicality , yeah happiness is something sparked by chemicals that cause that reaction . but that doesn t mean it can t be something we should all strive for . achieving happiness is everything . it s good feeling , and it s good for you ! so even if we re just weird little creatures vibing on brainy juices , it s such a special and meaningful thing .","725585":"hello ! . how are you ?","725586":"i used one of my favorite text generating websites ! https yaytext . com mini me the one i used is called mini stacked , and you have to put in what you want like this top small text bottom normal text and the generator will turn the text on top into tiny text ! but do be aware not every letter of the alphabet stacks neatly above the regular sized text ! some letters will dip below because they don t have a tiny unicode version . also , your top word should probably be smaller than or the same length as your bottom word to avoid more character dipping .","725587":"sometimes , but not all of the time ! right now it s still a little too warm to wear them . but in the winter they re super comfy !","725588":"i wouldn t be happy , no . and that s not even because i hold onto regrets for the way i ve lived my life . i mean that naturally ,

going by megabus . we were just dropped off on what seemed to be just some random road . and it was pouring rain . everyone else seemed to know where they were going but i was lost . i was in a massive city with a bunch of luggage , all by myself . eventually a woman comes up and asks for some money . she said she s trying to make her way to a woman s shelter to escape from an abusive situation . i gave her some money . i think she could tell i was new around because i looked a whole mess . she offered her spare jacket to me , and told me the ways i need to go to get to my destination . she even stopped our uber later on when she saw me to make sure that i was safe and with someone i wanted to be with . i said yes , and we parted ways .","725595":"sorry , couldn t resist replying with this","725596":"i ve been ready for a fun day for ages now . i ve been wondering when it s coming to be honest .","725597":"ah , i can t compare languages like that ! i think each different language has their own charm .","725598":"nope ! i ve mentioned in several asks , but i m taken . open , but taken . not actively searching at the moment though .","725599":"really that i don t know italian , or really that i want to learn new languages some day ? well either way , yes to both ! the only foreign language classes i ever got to take in hs is spanish . and i had gotten relatively good at general conversation stuff with spanish , but most of that knowledge is lost to time . memory problems suck .","725600":"unfortunately , i do not . some day i d like to mess around with learning new languages though !","725601":"i m watching regular show on hulu !","725602":"i m comfortable but thank you for checking to confirm that ! i ammm drumrolls . . .","725603":"i try my best to avoid clinging to the same options . relying on the same meals back to back is very exhausting ! though , i have been consuming a lot of the same drink if you ll accept that . i ve been pretty much adamant about having a hot or cold matcha latte every other day . why , you d i d n t ask ? well , matcha is a delicious bittersweet delicacy . and also , the small amount of caffeine is enough to pick me up but not overwhelm me .","725604":"coolio , thank u sm ! !","725605":"i own a ps ! and i own as well . but i ve never had an xbox before . i guess i ve never felt the need for one . i main on pc now anyways .","725606":"sure ! follow me back ? we can spam each other some time .","725607":"this is weirdly specific , but it s really one of my worst fears . imagine going to bed like normal , and waking up to find that you re the last living thing on earth . every object and building was left untouched . everything else perfectly normal . but there s no sentient life besides you anymore . it s irrational , and impossible , but terrifying to me .","725608":"i wanna say . . baseball ! i once went on a field trip to a stadium game in high school . i don t really like the sport , i was just there to not be in school .","725609":"um neither ? ? why are you trying to get funky with some nasty nasty","725610":"i think this behavior links to people having a very narrow sighted view of themselves . they don t take into account how their actions could be hurtful . they take only into account how they see themselves . and by that i mean , they seem to think they re far above their actions . at least . . . only if you mean they do this to deflect hurtful things they ve done . if you re just talking about judging what they ve done just because you don t like it . . i can t agree with that mindset .","725611":"i have clusters of memes in several different folders from downloading from different sources . and i aaalso have a bunch of memes stashed on my ssd among many other images that i hoard and refuse to get rid of .","725612":"idk , but apparently root beer does . get it ? root beer float ?","725613":"this september has been a weird one so far . the weather has been all over the place , so has my mood , and the vibes in general . . but i m chugging through it . i m hoping for a better turnaround by the end of the month .","725614":"whatever a woman wants to wear . i find attraction in self confidence and sure assertion of one s own image . also all women aren t carbon copies of each other , so it s not like one thing that looks attractive on one person is going to look attractive on everyone . what s attractive is individuality . and that s all i can think to say !","725615":"i am right now , for the time being ! i ve been popping in and out here this evening because i m at work . i realize this was sent an hour ago , but just sayin . i ll be online from time to time , and i get back to asks when i have the chance to reply to them properly .","725616":"hello there ! . happy friday to you !","725617":"p s .","725618":"i m willing to bet that i discovered memes some time around . . ? no maybe earlier . . it s been so long that i honestly don t remember . but it was whenever i first put my footprint into the world wide web . whenever that exactly was !","725619":"oh don t let them ever get to you . the only thing those kinds of anons really inform people on is how much intelligence they are lacking . in all reality and honesty , i ve seen you around on ask . fm for a while . and what i know you for is having interesting questions and a strong personality .","725620":"last night i cried because i was getting chest pains . it wasn t really even the pain that did it i ve had random chest pains for as long as i can remember so it just becomes the norm . . but i was just so overwhelmed by stuff piling on that i just had to cry a little bit .","725621":"each thing has their own perks . being deemed funny is usually a charismatic charm that furthers your social life . being smart is something that is highly beneficial in leading a person down a successful path in life . and being sexy is another kind of charm but it really depends on outside perspective if you benefit from your looks . naturally what would be better is to have it all , but i think i d go with smarts . being in a good spot in life is most idealistic for me .","725622":"spiced drinks . hot tea . fallen leaves . the crunching of leaves under feet . trees becoming barren . blanket wrapped cuddles . sleeping to the sound of rain and wind . there s so many peaceful things that the word autumn brings to mind .","725623":"i feel like i d want to name my discovery based upon what is actually visible from the planet like if it s a dust planet , or if it has life , or water , or is frozen . but most space discoveries are nowhere close enough to visit and discover more about it , so naming it would be hard . i suck at names . i d probably use a random name generator .","725624":"wait , do you mean me or the original sender ? who are you ? who are any of us ?","725625":"aww thanks ! it s nice to see someone use the shoutout feature to put some joy out there . i hope you have a great friday too ! and a happy weekend .","725626":"hihi ! i m doing okay , thank you . i had to take it easy for the rest of the night because work was exhausting . i hope things are going well on your side of the pond ! take care","725627":"ohh you need to try these . if you like their other snacks you d surely like the berries . do you have a favorite haribo snack , or do you just know of them ?","725628":"pineapple . but it wasn t very good because it was cut too close to the rind . parts of it were unnecessarily tough . i m planning on getting more soon , maybe cut in a different fashion . because of last time , i didn t get to have my cravings met .","725629":"i ve never held a python , or any other large snakes before . and you know . . i think i m good . i don t fear snakes or other reptiles . i simply don t know too much about them and wouldn t be able to properly handle one like it deserves .","725630":"i do , sometimes . but other times i get way too comfortable with alone time that i have to push myself out there and do something . it s not good for my mental health to block everyone out for extended periods of time .","725631":"you know . before last month , without hesitation , i would have said train . that s because last month was my first plane ride ! before then i d only traveled across states by train , and i d never even considered plane travel because of how scary it seemed . oh and of course let s not get into how expensive plane travel is . . anyways . hmm . . i mean i enjoyed my first plane ride experience ! it was exciting . but maybe i would just have to pick train travel , because sometimes relaxing is better than exciting . and i enjoy the mental certainty of getting somewhere safer because i m on the ground .","725632":"it s been too long since i ve written a point driven essay . i don t think i d have it in me to participate !","725633":"i would date men , women , or nonbinary persons of any race ! i have no tolerance for prejudice . skin color does not effect my attraction to or love for a person . that being said , i also don t seek out potential partners by skin color or race . i love who i love , and that s that !","725634":"i don t think i d be able to do contract based work like that ! it sounds really soul sucking . if i were to ever be offered a position , i would want it to be freelance work because i d be working on my own terms .","725635":"a spiritual gift i wish to be granted is the ability to astral project from my own body . there would be many uses to traveling the earth without a physical form ! but also i would like to have the ability to have accurate premonitions so that i could protect myself and others i care about .","725636":"sword , because learning how to battle with one would be pretty dope . and plus they re just cool . no one would ever expect someone in modern days to roll up wielding a sword . everyone will know not to mess with you .","725637":"there s only one place i ve been wanting to go back and visit , and that s maine . ever since i came back from my visit with my partner there , i have been wishing for another chance to get on a plane and go back .","725638":"i think being bossy is one of the most annoying personality traits someone can have . no one likes to be pushed around .","725639":"nope ! i don t play any sports actually .","725640":"only the best that i can ! i work hard , and i pitch in and help things run smooth when i m needed .","725641":"my core aesthetic is angelcore ! ! the imagery of cherubic entities and heavenly scenery brings me a deep internal calm . i ve also had a lot of people compare me to angels or holy figures from victorian era art , so that s how this core has stuck to me .","725642":"and here i was thinking i was sending too many questions out there , because someone the other day said that s all i do . i can spam you real quick if you really want that ! i don t mind .","725643":"aww , thank you ! ! both for how you took my response and for the compliment .","725644":"i ve had them a few times before , yeah ! we d have chicken fajitas , and the chicken was mixed with salsa . so it s not the proper way to have it but . . they were pretty good ! it s not something i d actively seek out probably , but it was alright .","725645":"everything is made up of molecules , but not everything made out of molecules is the same . you re made of molecules . so is that tree outside . you re nothing like the tree . aaand that s how !","725646":"thank you very much ! it means a lot that you took the time to send this in . i hope you have a good day .","725647":"no because i don t usually open external links , especially if i don t recognize them . i m sorry !","725648":"yep , i do ! i just re hooked it back up recently . i primarily play games on pc anymore , but i still have my old ps consoles . !","725649":"thank you so much i m going really well ! i feel like i should go to sleep soon but other than that i m on top of the world . how are you ?","725650":"so untrue ! . . i also post vs polls . also the point of ask at least to me is to reach out , ask , learn , and grow ! i think the most engaging part of this app is the ability to ask random people random things . it s a fun learning experience . for the most part , anyways . . some people aren t so interested in proper kind social interaction . .","725651":"oh heck i must have missed this , i m sorry ! thank you for stopping by and wishing me well . at the time of posting , it s monday , and it s not been a bad monday at all ! just really rainy and sleepy . i hope you re keeping well","725652":"oh hey , that s pretty cool ! i ve found a lot of useful programs and tools off of github . if you re saying you work on the website itself , keep up the good work !","725653":"i m torn between honey crisp apple juice and hot peppermint tea . they re both so tastey ! ! ugh , well i ll try and get away with saying i have two favorite drinks one favorite cold drink and one favorite hot drink !","725654":"this isn t just an issue with your partners ex wife . this is absolutely an issue with your partner too , maybe even more than it is an issue with his ex wife . all modern smartphones have the ability to block someone else s sms number . to me it doesn t seem like he wants her to stop . he s either entertaining wanting her back on the low , or just plain stupid . either way ? this situation these two are putting you in is hurtful to you . i wouldn t fight to stay with someone like your partner . you deserve better . i hope some day you put this mess behind you and seek the goodness you deserve . have a good day .","725655":"i have ! they re all dogs . so basically if you can t tell , i m a dog person . if anyone wants to know more about my pups , send some asks about them ! i d love to talk about them .","725656":"i would have to say this you can t have world peace without love . love makes the world go round . if you can t find love for the different kinds of people around you , there cannot be peace .","725657":"i ve never put too much thought behind it but you know what ? yeah , i kind of do ! some odd years back i always used to make myself omelettes for breakfast every other morning . and when i d crack an egg against the side of my bowl i d be happy to be able to split the halves and pour the egg in . also the sound when the egg splits open is just satisfying . like ahh , i didn t crack it into pieces , it opened just right .","725658":"i think that s a pretty valid reaction ! some movies can get you good even with the cheapest of scare tactics . it all depends on the type of person . for me it usually takes deep psychological horror to make me feel truly scared . but there s plenty of people who get scared from pop scares , and that s enough for them . i personally don t watch many movies , so i don t look for horror movies often . i love what the horror genre has to offer for art , however ! things like standalone pieces , or comics and manga .","725659":"yes of course ! there s nothing better feeling or better tasting than a cold bottle of water in the summer heat . water always gets looked down on for being flavorless and boring . but you need it to thrive ! plus , you can always add stuff to it if you really want to kick up a big stink about not liking it but me personally ? i like my water fresh and natural .","725660":"you did , cutiepie !","725661":"okay so , tell me why i received my own shoutout for one . and for two , why did i have to receive the deepest one . . ask . fm itself is out to get me . also i just checked and it doesn t say this is a shoutout , but it was ? ? i just sent a bunch through shoutout and this was one of many . i m lost .","725662":"i don t know of them , sorry !","725663":"yeeeessss i love pot roast and gravy with veggies .","725664":"positive me is always the better me . it s why i try to maintain positivity !","725665":"my first date was with a shitty emo guy a few grades older than me to a graveyard . so .","725666":"there s this really good chill hip hop rap group by the name of tokyo health club , and i really like their song supermarket .","725667":"i love mango juice ! ! tropical and fruity things are my favorite . i don t get to have it often because chicken teriyaki doesn t like it . and i don t finish things very fast by myself so no one can help me sip on some fruity fun juice .","725668":"introvert . with the burning desire to stop being so introverted and start expanding as a person . i am tired of enviously watching born introverts have fun . i want to go out and do the same !","725669":"beastars","725670":"i have bangs right now ! and sometimes i think about not having them , but i feel like i d really miss them if they were gone . . i d wanted them for so long that letting go is hard .","725671":"i see dreams as a way for your unconscious mind to display everything that s been on your plate for a while . dreams can show you your love , your fear , your wants , your hopes , your deepest feelings . . so when you see someone who has passed away in a dream , i think that your brain is just trying to give you another chance to see them . or to visualize how loss truly makes you feel .","725672":"my partner tells me that i could be a beauty blogger vlogger because of the products that i use and the way i talk about them . it s silly i never thought i d have the personality for such a thing but he seems to think so .","725673":"i m often torn about this , but my top favorite color has to be pastel pink . besides that , i love periwinkle ! maybe that could be my new favorite . . pastel pink is always overdone .","725674":"i think you re offering this as a free space post , so i ll take it and use it to post what s been on my mind . the seasons are turning , and i m expecting to see our neighborhood squirrels much less . they ve already been so sparse lately because of the amount of outdoor activity here . i m worried about them , and i just want for them to be well .","725675":"if i was able to name a star , i d name it after my sweetheart lars . when i see the stars in the sky he s what i think about . plus he already calls himself star in a lot of online spaces , so it just works !","725676":"i am more of a dog person , but i love both generally ! i simply am more used to being around dogs than i am cats .","725677":"actually , yeah ! for some reason , friday has the power to bring on seratonin where there was none the day before . just knowing that i ve made it through to the end of yet another week makes me feel happy .","725678":"i m sorry . i don t recognize the source name in the link , so i m not opening it . i don t open off app links usually . i can t help ya .","725679":"yes of course ! i m not the biggest fan of dark chocolate because of the intense bitterness , however . and i like white chocolate sometimes , if i feel like i can handle the intensity of how sweet it is . but milk chocolate ? absolutely love it . i don t eat chocolate often because it s not a snack i always seek out . but i m sure craving it now . . .","725680":"u um this might help u https www . google . com url ? sa t source web rct j url https m . youtube . com watch

flashy appearance . i just want something that can adhere to my needs . i don t need anything flashy .","725682":"soup , like the food ? i love soup ! ! there s nothing better than a hearty bowl of soup , especially when it s getting cold out . i used to stock up on cans during winter .","725683":"my favorite pass time as of recent is playing skyrim ! i m getting back into playing it because i heavily modded it to make it more interesting .","725684":"how are you","725685":"their dirty diapers . . ? djdjdjd i don t spend any time around babies , let alone would i ever feel comfortable enough to babysit . i m not very child oriented , so to me everything stinks about babysitting .","725686":"off the top of my head , here s what i can remember red burgundy grey black blue salmon hot pink i actually don t wear jeans all that often ! usually i look for very particular styles , because those are more physically comfortable for me to wear .","725687":"if it was ever necessary , of course ! however my posture is fine as of right now , so thankfully it s not a concern of mine at the moment .","725688":"transforms into this","725689":"that s such a hard choice ! ! aaaahh okay , i think . . i ll probably have to settle on picking pancakes . i ve always been a pancake person . i mean , have you had blueberry pancakes ? strawberry . . ? chocolate chip ? ? pancakes are soft , fluffy , good sometimes gooey depending on what you put in it goodness .","725690":"all of the time . . i feel like i have to have my phone on me because it s the only way to be in touch with most of the important people in my life .","725691":"at the time of posting this , my clock says","725692":"honestly a little drowsy , but overall fine ! i woke up a couple hours earlier than normal this morning and just decided to stay awake . i had a pretty crappy nightmare , revolving around the same topic as the night before . i m pretty much over it now , but i can t shake this sleepy feeling ! anyways , how are you ?","725693":"the most spontaneous thing i ve ever done was actually very recent ! without making many plans , i picked up my stuff and went to maine to meet one of my partners irl for the first time . and stayed with him for a week . spontaneous , crazy , new , but would i do it all over again ? absolutely .","725694":"my most recent favorite anime is beastars . it s one that i more recently within the last year got into , and i ve rewatched it times ! i enjoy it for the interesting spin on how animals with humanlike sentience behave in a world bound by instinct of predator and prey . the psychological elements intrigue me , and the characters interest me . plus the animation style is unique ! my all time favorite anime is inuyasha , however . it was my first anime . i was a tiny , restless tot that woke up one time at am . i wanted to see what was on the tv , so i turned it on and went to cartoon network . that s when i discovered adult swim , toonami , and an anime with a temperamental dog eared boy from the feudal era who said bad words on tv .","725695":"more than anything right now , i m craving honey crisp apple juice .","725696":"this is an art piece on one of the windows in the phl airport ! i love how artsy this airport is . there s so much to stop and look at between flights .","725697":"i know i m answering this two months later , and it

outside and do some gardening ! some day i d like to have a flower garden for all different types of flowers , and a place for berry bushes . that d probably be the extent of my green thumb .","725699":"it s been a long time since i ve spent a whooole day off of my phone . i usually only part with it to be away from social media for me time . that typically doesn t last the whole day through , because i have friends and a partner who i can only talk to via my phone . and i care a lot about them so i try not to be away for too long .","725700":"my favorite show of all time is gonna have to be beastars . but a big favorite right now has definitely got to be . . regular show ! i ve been binge watching it ever since i came back from visiting my partner .","725701":"hi there , long time no speak !","725702":"i last bragged abouuut . . how funny i am to one of my partners . he was inclined to agree , because i m a very punny bunny .","725703":"pastel pink is definitely the color i d most associate with myself . besides the fact that it heavily compliments my skin , it s just satisfying to look at . it s a very soft , fluffy , happy color to me .","725704":"this is a weirdly specific ask , and it isn t one i can provide an answer to . i don t seek out love interests with their job in mind . i seek out love interests for the person that they are , not for what they work as .","725705":"i like a few of her songs ! i wouldn t say i know much about her as a person , so i can t necessarily judge her character . but her music from songs i ve heard so far is enchanting . i like her voice .","725706":"i want to use this free space to say i m ready for fall ! i m done with the overwhelming sweaty gross summer heat . i want to go out walking in the woods when the leaves

ve been away for a good , long while . there s been a lot going on in my everyday life and i ll be honest i got pretty busy ! i ve experienced loss , dragged myself through grief , found new love , found new hope , traveled , made memories . . and i while all this change in my life was happening , i simply didn t have the time to check ask . fm . it specifically the app has been really funky and messed up , and i couldn t find the patience for it until now . now that i ve got a better grasp on things , i m here to socialize and have fun ! this is just me putting my reasons for my absence simply . feel free to ask more questions , as i ll be taking the time later this evening to filter through them since i m back . i ve missed n y all ! be safe and have a good rest of your week

important philosophy to me and my growth as a person .","725719":"closing mcdonald s would be such b . d . e because of their really long history of doing disgusting things . but doing that would

debate with the right crowd of weird people .","725728":"g one gone and there you have it !","725729":"chicken teriyaki","725730":"i feel like my purpose in life comes from spreading positivity where i can . i like to bring light into people s lives , and i like to take care of animals to show them kindness too .","725731":"just for anyone who gets endless slews of rude anons i promise you , it is not your fault . i haven t been rude to a single person on here , and i get things like this on the regular . keep your head up and keep shining ! people who abuse the anon function of apps like this are void of any meaningful life . just move on and keep shining ! happy monday .","725732":"of course i would . and i have . and right now i currently am ! my primary partner life partner and i met online almost ten years ago . he moved here a few years back to live with me . but one of my other partners lives a few states away . love doesn t have a distance limit , and true love is deeper than

overwork me . but that was a while ago and i put my foot down to stop that .","725736":"i ve never personally written a song , but i ve thought about it . also my brain wrote a song in a dream once . it was weird to hear a song that didn t exist played for me so beautifully . its genre is something i can only class as indie . the brain is an incredible and weird thing , isn t it ?","725737":"i will never go sky diving . both for the fact that i ll probably never have the opportunity , and i m way too afraid for all of that . knowing my luck , my parachute would probably be broken . or i
