you have to follow ?","2126":"how many rules did you break to be with geno ? ?","2127":"you said you broke several rules when you married geno , is that why he stayed on the save screen for so long

away . he s going straight to the source . . . and not peacefully","2135":"i swear i m going to k ! ll thegoddessoflife rules be damned","2136":"he s trying not to freak out entirely cause if he completely loses his cool no one will be able to hold things together","2137":"geno s now back at reaper s side , if he were still alive he d have had a soul attack at this point","2138":"wouldn t that actually be a reverse papyrus ? papyrus jumps out of buildings through windows asgore jumps into buildings through windows","2139":"asgore freaking bursts through the window to help his son lol but thankfully he s nice enough to fix the window with his magic","2140":"should i get your asgore ? could he help ?","2141":"what ! ? ? on a scale of at least a","2142":"we re fighting together remember , i won t run off , but i need to know what happened","2143":"geno finally thinks to check the supplies epic brought and finds a stimulant that he administers to reaper , it will keep him awake and more focused for a little while reaper what happened","2144":"stars i need some stimulants just enough to keep you awake long enough to tell me what happened he searches through their medical supplies but so far only finds sedatives","2145":"reaper , what happened . please , i need to know","2146":"that doesn t looke like something that will clar up with rest ! i mean that s like saying mt kill wound just needs some rest his voice is growing increasingly panicked","2147":"reaper what happened ! ? your back ! ? those burns ? ! the life flower didn t help at all ?

soft smile on his face","2159":"geno removes the blindfold and smiles looking around , he gives reaper a hug , it may not be a work of art but he clearly put a lot of effort into it","2160":"you know you could accomplish the same with an eye patch since i have only the one working eye light","2161":"what do you mean ?","2162":"the only thing wrong is i m lost in my memories","2163":"you didn t do

sure you re up for that ? i could text thebrokenglitch and see f he ll talk to ink about helping us","2200":"what are you going to do ? geno saw the wince and is worried","2201":"i might have overdone it a bit with lady death , i ll be fine , thanks to epictalesans my magic reserves are still really high , i just need rest","2202":"geno s lone eye light flicks away from reaper , probably all the answer he needs","2203":"if he behaves if he doesn t . . . well . . . it s not murder if you cause a little accident i prefer to word it as some mortal middle management","2204":"i ll be fine , any injury i got life patched up , i m just tired from well . . . the blaster beasts but he doesn t want reaper to flip out","2205":"you didn t forget nova banished him back to the void , did you ? https ask . fm entrynumber answers should give goth the scare needed to make him behave","2206":"i m trying to break them of that habit , i think it would help if you said to the kids you were wrong to teach them that","2207":"shaken , i wasn t expecting one of our kids to cause so much trouble . . .","2208":"and don t worry , gaster may be gone , but someone else is there to keep him company","2209":"geno still seems agitated , but doesn t protest more , he seems content with reaper holding him at the moment","2210":"i ll let goth out when he learns his lesson","2211":"you should ask life to heal you too you did get hit by a tree and sent through your roof","2212":"gaster never got out . . . he became one with the void because he fell into the core and he didn t have determination to save him","2213":"reaper the void isnt the antivoid ! the void is where my gaster was trapped where he tried to get me to give up to in despair","2214":"wait wait wait did you say the void ? ! ! ? geno tries getting up but has a bit of a dizzy spell and doesn t manage it","2215":"he sees all that and looks up at reaper what the stars happened here ?","2216":"what happened after i got knocked out ? ! he has no idea goth got half their house destroyed with a tree","2217":"of course i can but we should wait to make sure he s fully healed then you have some explaining to do","2218":"i have a bit of a skullache but otherwise i think i m ok goth is in serious trouble though","2219":"geno s eye opens reaper ? well this wasn t how i planned on greeting you when you got home he tries lightening the mood with a joke","2220":"i don t appreciate being ignored death . . but fine , you ll explain to me after he s healed i suppose . .","2221":"the life goddess appears in a golden light and kneels down beside death , using her healing magic on dontcallmesans death . . what on earth has happened ? don t you dare lie to me either . . why is geno like this ?","2222":"actually writes the message and attaches it to the crow","2223":"send a crow","2224":"maybe bring geno with you and go to life ?","2225":"fortunately geno doesnt seem to be in pain , if you hadnt seen the crack in his skull he could be mistaken for sleeping though the life flower healed the crack geno isn t conscious yet","2226":"he doesn t wake but he does tuck his skull against reaper s chest , so he s still there at least","2227":"given how fragile he looks right now while unconscious it s hard to imagine this is the same monster who beat lady death the other day","2228":"i suggest you punish the kid , but do it before you wake geno","2229":"your idiot eldest son managed to knock out geno , he might have hit his head pretty bad","2230":"i don t think you need to worry about thegoddess fdeath bothering geno , he really damaged her pride by beating her , unlike you she doesn t know how strong your husband can be . don t mistake this as me flirting with him , i think you two are good together","2231":"if someone tries to kidnap me they ll regret it , and aside from ganz who is dead , who is dumb enough to even try geno grins trying to reassure him","2232":"just make sure you keep me updated with texts ok ? he doesn t want reaper to leave , but he also doesn t want him to get in trouble","2233":"so you have a lot of work to catch up on then ? , on the plus side your gaster hasn t been seen since nova broke his mirror","2234":"what problems ?","2235":"ha ha , no","2236":"happy halloween","2237":"are you gonna tell the reverse reapertale gods about lady

now","2241":"he s really that butthurt over me being with you ? that s kinda sad honestly","2242":"like i said i m not going anywhere","2243":"feeling better having gotten that off your chest ?","2244":"geno just hugs reaper you didn t know , i know if you knew what they really were you would never have eaten them . no wonder you feel betrayed . . .","2245":"geno just hugs him tightly","2246":"i ve stuck with you through everything , why would this be any different , i m not going anywhere","2247":"then why won t you tell me what s wrong ?","2248":"years and you still don t trust me ?","2249":"reaper how long have we been together ?","2250":"geno sighs , he can tell reaper isn t gonna talk about whatever is bothering him anytime soon","2251":"it s good , but why did you bring some for a few days ? ? geno isn t gonna say anything on reaper saying that out loud . . . at the moment anyway","2252":"geno just gives reaper a look of concern before eating the food he brought back","2253":". . . . i mean you dont have to tell me but you are clearly upset and i want to help","2254":"then hwy haven t you been able to look me in the eye","2255":"ok reaper seriously what s going on ?","2256":"reaper , if he hasn t left you already , he s not going to leave you over soul eating , just stop eating souls .","2257":"yeah i m awake he sees all the bags think you got enough grillby s ?","2258":"oof geno has no idea what s going on but he s feeling pretty hurt by reaper s behavior he decides to go lie down once reaper s walked away","2259":"well yeah but clearly something happened between you and lady death , and i know you don t have a ton of friends to begin with it seems like she did something to betray your trust geno doesn t know about the apples","2260":"hey you ok ?","2261":"how would you introduce yourself on dating app ?","2262":"running past him","2263":"i ll be fine , though i m feeling like we re due for some lazy time","2264":"well that just means you have to do most of the work next time he is gonna suffer backlash but he ll hide it if he can","2265":"geno teleports them home and clinks reaper s cheek see when we work together we re unstoppable","2266":"i ll cover you","2267":"geno s eye lights up , reaper isn t alone this time","2268":"yeah i am , what s up ?","2269":". . . reaper i need to explain glue to you later","2270":"https ask . fm godofprematuredeath answers","2271":"no , don t worry it s not like she has a skeleton monster trapped inside her , but humans have skeletons that give them their shape . that s why sometimes people from other multiverses think we re dead humans","2272":"handplates has pictures of her skeleton if you re interested . . . don t ask","2273":"you didn t know that ? geno came over their skeletons aren t like us though","2274":"uhm , yeah , i mean it s not sentient , but i mean what did you think held me together ? !","2275":"you cut off one of my wings before did you not notice there were bones in it ? !","2276":"well he s probably just seen her arm regrow , it starts with the skeletal structure erupting from the stump which then has muscle wind around it before flesh ripples down over the muscles to finish the arm , she flexes it a few times","2277":"oh please . like i care about them , papy will take care of that and i ll get off scot free once again !","2278":"reaper ? geno calls out from their room are you guys alright ?","2279":"if this was a prank i wouldn t be about to faint from blood loss after she sliced off my arm with her scythe . . . .","2280":"mweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! chasing reaper temmie across reapertale , slashing at her furiously with his scythe i ll make you proud papy ! ! ! i swear i will ! ! ! ! !","2281":"she told you it was the soul of a frog , she lied , reaper you ate the soul of a version of muffet , i know you couldn t have known that but she lied to you","2282":"the life flower doesn t do anything , meaning the injury was inflicted by a god after dragging reaper away from his bedroom she explains what happened with lady death and the papyrus she stopped her from eating epic is looking after him right now , but you need to know that apple she gave you","2283":"not important , we need to talk outside now !","2284":". . . no i can t geno knows reaper isn t as self aware as he is and this could break the poor god","2285":"reaper ! a familiar voice shouts before the halfbreed appears in the doorway , currently missing her lower right arm which isn t bleeding much anymore she s deathly pale we need to talk now ! !","2286":"basically i was completely different in the original epictale , but since the overwrite was prevented from existing , gaster helped neutral figure out a way to change the world anyways","2287":"well are you done drooling on me","2288":"well . . . about that . . . it s more like two timelines instead of one , the second being a reboot of the other","2289":"geno just facepalms that s why you were drooling ?","2290":"geno elbows him hey you re drooling on me you goof","2291":"it s a miracle geno just smiles slightly","2292":"it takes some effort but he stops laughing fine , fine , sorry bout that after getting reaper in bed he soon is under the covers himself i m glad for a day where i can go to sleep at night not worrying about this family","2293":"geno helps him walk over though he has to stifle some laughter","2294":"need a hand getting over there ?","2295":"experiment on me ? he created me . and gave me this damn eye . then fused with pacifist frisk so he could escape the consequences","2296":"hey i only have half the bone mass you do , you were already heavy , now i might not be able to lift you without breaking something geno is joking around but bet it makes reaper worry instead","2297":"i won t , but maybe you should figure out how to use those legs of yours before one of the kids sees","2298":"i literally can t die . that wingding a hole doesn t let me","2299":"maybe geno helps him back to his feet","2300":"you don t know do ya bruh ? then again , i only ever confess to cross . . .","2301":"geno chuckles slightly did you just fall for me all over again ?","2302":"i m just worried , what if she went after our kids , i mean they all inherited some dt from me . . . .","2303":"geno helps him out , moving the machinery","2304":"welp . guess i m kicking lady death s ass . can you kick life s instead","2305":"geno unhooks the equipment since reaper no longer needs it there now you re not dragging around a bunch of extra gear","2306":"if you hadn t stepped in to defend me it might have . . . she really wanted a soul with determination , even just a fraction like mine","2307":"there were three trees tree of life , tree of magic and tree of feelings . . .","2308":"dream isn t the only guardian of a tree bruh","2309":"s sorry just remembering when lady death threatened to turn my

t know what they said , but it doesn t matter , we re still here , still together so they can all go rot","2435":"what gossip about yourself has made you laugh ?","2436":"doesn t matter , we re going home","2437":"geno followed their soulbond to find reaper what happened ? !","2438":"didn t you cause geno to hang himself when you had hatred ?","2439":"i m uhhh not from a au i kinda just exist in a universe with humans and sentient animals living together in peace mostly . . uh yeah i do ! it s kinda cold now though . gives him it sorry . . . ! !","2440":"well they asked me if i ve ever self armed so it s not just you they re being jerks to","2441":"who cares why they brought it up , that s in the past , don t dwell on it geno suspects the reason the anon brought it up was to compare reaper to ganz who keeps sensy drugged and is just shutting this topic down","2442":"when you had hatred didn t you keep geno drugged so he wouldn t leave you ?","2443":"sighs that s better . calms down that s a good thing i rather not see you do what youre suppose to do . . . is there anything i can get you scary skeleton dude ?","2444":"i just dont like the pointy thing youre holding . . . ! it triggers a instinctual fear . . . . everything feels off about you in general like youre not normal even for a monster . .","2445":"you should thank onryotatarigami for the advanced warning about ganzgztale earlier . the idiot said in front of her he was planning on going after geno","2446":"eeep ! jumps scared lol do you even reap animals ?","2447":"and you re creepier than the other skeleton i met ! i ll be sure to tell him ! hehe ! sets the box next to him","2448":"apparently that cafe sans you kidnapped when you were an error sent the bunny over","2449":"some monster name ccino ! i m jasper ! i m not a monster just a talking bunny . i dont have magic like you guys do ! this place is kinda scary . . . ! shivers","2450":"oh this is where he sent me . . . ? ! oh well ! i m just here to give you these ! jasper hops off to give reaper the box","2451":"delivering donuts to you hello anyone home ?","2452":"to be fair you can act cute when i m there . just most people don t see that","2453":"anon i think you broke him","2454":"you really are a cinnamon roll aren t you ?","2455":"how long does it take for metal to break with your death touch ?","2456":". . . who the hell could be knocking on the door geno goes to check","2457":"knocks on the house s outside door","2458":"stop being silly , just a mystery story is all , i figure it s probably better if i stay here to keep an eye on you","2459":"how quickly do things age , like could a being with a really long lifespan touch you for a moment","2460":"geno is seated nearby paging through a book","2461":"how come your scythe doesnt fall apart ?","2462":"what if the doctors wore gloves ?","2463":"is there anything thats immune to your death touch ?","2464":"i think geno should take you to a hospital you dont look ok at all","2465":"don t get out of bed , you are on ivs , nova might have stopped your soul from shattering but you clearly still need to recover","2466":"he does catch reaper , and gets the god in bed quickly hooking him up to another iv","2467":"geno turns to reaper after ganz is dust are you gonna be ok ?","2468":"gz would you trade geno to me if i gave you a doughnut ? ganz steps in the doorway not hard to get here when you have a ghost following you mel not actually a ghost but it s easier to explain it that way","2469":"do you like ketchup ?","2470":"pfft just get some rest , ok ?","2471":"im worried about you , other than that i m justtired","2472":"well i already took his phone from him , so he s pretty bent out of shape about that . . . you re gonna be ok right ?","2473":"still if we re in bed he shouldn t be pranking us to begin with","2474":"i am , i think we ve been back maybe a full day and already goth has managed to get into a lot of trouble","2475":"yeah sure geno does lie down , he seems tired , but after that scare can you blame him","2476":"geno just sighs , not one of relief one of exhaustion","2477":"geno pulls one out from his scarf using it on the ailing god","2478":"in our bedroom geno s relieved reaper is more lucid","2479":"geno literally lifts reaper with his blue magic and changes the god out of the wet robe into the dry one , before setting him down somewhere that isn t soaked there , feels better right ?","2480":"hey , you need to change out of those wet clothes , then you can sleep , ok ?","2481":"well now geno s worried , he tries getting reaper s attention death ? ! you can tell he s worried when he switches to calling him death . . . . .","2482":"geno nudges reaper hey reaper ?","2483":"geno comes back over with a dry robe reaper , here i got you a dry robe","2484":"geno sighs and moves reaper off him before getting up and going over to their closet","2485":"maybe you should change out of those wet clothes","2486":"hey dad ! think fast ! goth then sprays his dad with a water bottle","2487":"geno decides to keep an eye on him , just in case","2488":"i ll tell you later , just sleep for now","2489":"geno is half watching goth implode with palette half focused on reaper","2490":"geno puts his book to the side for the moment and just pets reaper s skull","2491":"geno sighs please dont pull that kind of stunt again , i honestly don t know what i d do if your soul shattered and you were gone gone . . .","2492":"yeah ?","2493":"so after everything that s happened do you think you re gonna try and be friends with onryotatarigami ?","2494":"while reaper was asleep geno switched out his old iv bag for a new one , without waking the god , before getting back in bed","2495":"yeah geno freaked and fainted from the panic , here s hoping none of their kids walk in","2496":"he went home with your kids since they were going stir crazy , you can call him or text him still if you re worried","2497":"well maybe monsters don t heal as well here , i don t know what to tell you , you re still in bad condition you need to recover more , so just stay put and rest up so geno doesn t have to cry over a pile of dust","2498":"geno placed you there , look if your soul is having trouble you shouldn t push things","2499":"you clearly aren t fine , if i d known you were still in this kind of shape i d have tried healing you more","2500":"you clearly aren t fine","2501":"know what i ll go home with the kids , they are going a little stir crazy , why don t you recover a bit more . . . .","2502":"this isn t helping , reaper would it be unsafe for us to return to the multiverse ?","2503":"good to know yeah i had another anon fail","2504":"you might of told geno that anon could of been him","2505":"are you ready to return home ?","2506":"which superstition you believe to be true ?","2507":"i ll ask the kids , if they all want to go home then we ll go geno lays reaper down so he s resting on a pillow i ll be back soon","2508":"her yandere certainly doesn t . . . . not marvul or alastor , an older one","2509":"geno catches him so he doesn t hit the ground i think you re staying put","2510":"well if you cant stand then we aren t leaving","2511":"yeah , we probably should","2512":"yeah , apparently it s a city full of dead bodies . . . i m worried they ll get into more trouble","2513":"reaper i know you still need rest , but i think the kids are starting to go stir crazy , raven already investigated that vesra place nova asked us to stay away from","2514":"can you move i can t feel my legs you ve been laying on them for so long","2515":"you re getting heavy","2516":"geno nudges reaper s shoulder hey reaper","2517":"it takes goth a little while but he does return with the iv stand and bags um . . i brought back the stuff","2518":"geno sighs and moves reaper off him enough so that he can sit up before letting the god rest his skull in his lap","2519":"geno sighs hey gothy gothofdeaths could you grab an iv , i think your dad needs one , there should be some in a fridge on the first floor","2520":"geno takes reaper s phone from his hand","2521":"who are you in a parallel universe ?","2522":"who were you trying to text ? and what do you mean before you pass out","2523":"reaper what are you doing ?","2524":"so i guess this is happening . . . you better be alright","2525":"well i guess we aren t going anywhere since you are currently using me as a pillow","2526":"that stutter is worrying me , you usually only stutter when you re doing badly","2527":"reaper you stuttered , you doing alright ?","2528":"yeah it kinda is . . . though it s also kinda sad that we are so used to chaos we don t know how to react to peace","2529":"where would i have gone ?","2530":"geno chuckles this place really messes with your sleep schedule , though i do want to see what a sunset looks like here . . .","2531":"yeah , i guess that s true , it s nice waking up and not having the whole family in a state of crisis","2532":"it s actually daytime at this point though since days and nights are longer here they probably sleep during the daytime hours here are you and gothy doing ok ?","2533":"i feel a bit muddled , you erased part of my memory again didn t you ? geno hasn t sat up he s still lying down","2534":"what happened ?","2535":"several hours later ngh his lone eye opens reaper ?","2536":"um . . for once i actually agree with you . . uh . . tell mom i m sorry when he wakes up . . . goth starts backing away","2537":"what seems to be a tree suddenly starts growing from the ground in front of reaper , but instead of growing into a tree it becomes a stockade . . . maybe they should stop fighting","2538":"no you ! goth sticks his tongue out at his dad","2539":"i can craft another one , just cease fighting","2540":"geno is gonna take awhile to rebound from this , as things currently are when reaper shook him geno just went limp and collapsed against him","2541":"he has heard her call it her kingdom before afer the incident with alastor if i catch any of you fighting again i will have to take more severe steps to curtail this behavior she heads inside probably confusing the absolute f ck out of the afterdeath kids who witnessed that","2542":"thanks nova . . and dad , you can shut up !","2543":"did you forget , this is my kingdom and while you stay here you are under my protection , even if that means protecting you from yourselves she places a hand on each of them causing the ice to melt","2544":"your still a pr huh ! ? goth stops and looks at onryotatarigami u um . . . b besides being chilled to the bone . . ? i h hit dad , he faked being more hurt than he was to teach me a lesson and it broke mom . . this is all his fault ! he let s out a sneeze","2545":"the temperature suddenly plunges around reaper and gothofdeaths and they see ice forming on their bones what is going on nova s voice has a tone of royal authority to it you ve never heard before","2546":"goth once free since his dad started attacking the mod , grabs a lamp from the pagoda and breaks it over his dads skull stop strangling everybody !","2547":"yeah the idea of geno possibly losing a family member at the hands of another , no way that was triggering","2548":"well all you did was teach me how to be a pr ck and get free hugs from making people worry about me when there s nothing wrong ! good job dad ! dad of the year everybody !","2549":"at this point geno s lone eyelight vanishes like someone blew out a candle , he s just silent kneeling at reaper s side , he couldn t handle hearing this","2550":"what happened ! ? ? ! ?","2551":"reaper ? ! ! ? gothofdeaths come here ! !","2552":"geno goes looking for him , trying to follow their soulbond","2553":"raven and silver still aren t back when geno wakes mhn reaper ? you awake ?","2554":"geno dozed off , the fact that days and nights are longer here has kinda thrown off his sleep schedule","2555":"reaper you aren t dusting","2556":"i hope you know asgore is freaking the f ck out about your disappearance . . . yes nova forgot to tell him until now","2557":"nope , you made it back in one piece","2558":"hey reaper","2559":"you haven t figured out i m immortal yet ? the type of hybrid i am is only mortal during their childhood ,","2560":"big sis nova ? ? goth just stares at nova i ve never seen anyone hug my dad besides mom . . everyone kinda hates or fears him . . sometimes both . . this is weird . .","2561":"i m not normally the hug type , but you looked like you needed one . did you see life yet about silver and raven or should we stop by there first","2562":"probably to reaper s extreme shock nova hugs him hey it s ok he feels warmth radiating from her and sinking into his bones , his injuries begin healing","2563":"there s a flash of violet and the half angel appears in it so what the heck happened ? geno just looked scared out of his mind and asked me to find you","2564":"uhm mr reaper ? palette looks guilty , but he s just feeling guilty on goth s behalf i m not as good at healing as my mom or dad but if you have any small injuries that are bothering you i can paint them away healing them","2565":"what you know that others don t ?","2566":"i think everyone expects some godly mettaton ex from reapertale not knowing what yours is actually like","2567":"i bet alphys , gaster or mettaton could help him , it d make sense for them to know about mortal technology . . . especially mettaton","2568":"you could teach him , he s a lot more likely to listen to you than life","2569":"guessing geno taught you how to use most of the things in your house","2570":"does asgore have a phone ? maybe you could give him one , so that way if you need his help , you can just call or text him like you do geno","2571":"depends on how it manifests , in my case and my dad s it is telepethy and a form of aura sensing , for opal it s seeing ghosts and being able to talk with them","2572":"geno might have dozed off while reaper was hugging him . . . is cute","2573":"we re not sure , we suspect she has some non human in her ancestry although a th sense isn t completely unheard of among humans , i mean my dad has a mild th sense that my hybridization strengthened greatly","2574":"i was taking shelter there , i tried to stay places humans wouldn t find me so the facility wouldn t be able to track me down . must be funny for you seeing how confidant i am now to think of me cowering in hiding from humans . and yeah opal talks to ghosts","2575":"you know how nova and opal met ? opal is a medium who helps ghosts move on to the other side , nova hid in the attic of a haunted house that she had been hired to cleanse . opal found her cowering in the attic","2576":"well based off the fact nova seemed to know something was going on i m guessing there was actually someone else in your mind as opposed to it just being voices . was it bowsoflights ? he s the only other telepath i know of","2577":"i volunteered for project evolution , i was a simple scientist before then . though i did not know the truth of the organization i worked for , if i had i would never have offered to be their test subject","2578":"i only ever saw cybernetics in alphys anime , it s when you have a regular human with robotic enhancements , a complex , well that word has a few definitions but based off the context i heard from nova it s basically a place built to survive the end of the world and keep the people inside alive","2579":"right now geno is just very confused","2580":"hmn how to put this in a way you might understand . . . the experiments they did on me to give me the abilities i have also gave them complete control of my life , they choose if i am active or dormant","2581":"considering they can turn off the neural cybernetic mesh that is integrated into my brain and thus render me comatose until they decide to reactivate my cybernetics saying i was forced to do what i did is not much of a stretch","2582":"they managed to hold nova captive for years , we have no idea what they re capable of","2583":". . . lyon and i . . . it s hard to explain , i mean he was in charge of the experiments run on me , but he also kept the full scope of my abilities at the time back then secret which was how i could escape","2584":"reaper i understand wanting to help nova after everything she s done , but please do not go picking a fight with a giant organization from outside our multiverse , we have enough to deal with here","2585":"lyon is subject one , and like me he s immune to death i could bring back lyon s account for a little while actually , he s a more skilled telepath than nova is so he could probably reach reaper just tracing the mental wavelengths nova s communicated with","2586":"i doubt they even know , only the top operatives knew anything the rest just followed orders . maybe lyon would know where the other complexes are but considering he s a heavily guarded asset i m not sure it d be possible to reach him anyway","2587":"i could take you there , but i have no idea how big the organization really is , i was housed in the north american complex that had hundreds of scientists and mercenaries working there at any given time but i heard about a european and asian complex , and i don t even know where any of them are . . . .","2588":"sorell and shino are doing ok , guess we re lucky that they re content just to play together . . . . i haven t heard from goth at all","2589":"yeah she can","2590":"geno chuckles slightly at that probably , nova said she might be able to revive them but she s already done so much , if we could get word to life somehow","2591":"just thinking about raven and silver . . . they dusted almost a month ago and we never had a chance to revive them","2592":"hmn ? he looks over at reaper , he seems upset . . . what was he thinking about as he stared outside","2593":"when reaper wakes up he s not in geno s lap anymore , the glitch was standing near a set of windows looking outside","2594":"what was the last thing you got for free ?","2595":"why dont you just rest there for awhile . . .","2596":"yeah well mine s kinda stuck like that","2597":"geno puts a hand on reaper s careful touching your skull it might still be a little sore . . .","2598":"i think you meant if they re dead in the alpha timeline , i mean humans don t live that long . also you saw me on the save screen back before frisk ended up trapped there too . back when i was completely alone","2599":"they stopped resetting after finishing the true pacifist run where they also got me off the save screen . . . .","2600":"wait have we really known each other that long ? ? i guess that means my frisk would have died of old age by now . . . . such a strange thought","2601":"i could say the same to you , you were out cold for awhile after that head injury . . .","2602":"that s . . . i m not sure , i mean now i have people who i can talk to and who are fine with me being what i am but it s still such a novel thing to me , i mean i haven t even been free a decade yet","2603":"well glad to see you re getting along geno woke up at some point","2604":"she sighs and sits on the ground nearby yeah i know far too well what you re talking about","2605":"considering ive proven to your gaster that i can take him , i doubt he d want to fight again any time soon . oh i grabbed some extra clothes for all of you when geno asked me to pick up some more ivs","2606":"not like he can do anything about it , we re outside the underverse , you guys are the only ones who have seen it","2607":"yup , i grabbed a shard when i shattered it","2608":"nova walks over and picks up a shard of mirror you might recognize this . . .","2609":"sounds like someone regained consciousness nova descends the nearby stairwell","2610":"just ignore them if they try bugging you again","2611":"anons can you please leave us alone","2612":"well the king of hell is a fallen angel . . .","2613":"do you remember the demon you tried attacking in nova s room ? apparently he told her she was overlord material . . . as in overlord of hell","2614":"i m fine , but if i have to keep dragging you around i won t be , so try not to collapse again alright geno flashes reaper a cheeky grin at that statement","2615":"nova repaired the crack . . . it was kinda freaky to watch but . . . she also grabbed a few extra sets of clothes for us from our house .","2616":"i m not the one who cracked ther skull right open","2617":"you re awake ? geno doesn t bother sitting up","2618":"geno got reaper back downstairs and is flopped over in exhaustion","2619":"nova pricked open her finger and paints a line of blood along the crack though reaper s skull , the crack almost immediately begins to fuse closed , bone regrowing to completely fill the hole at the top of his skull","2620":"sh ! t ! ! ?","2621":"geno pulls reaper s hood off his skull","2622":"which fictional character would you date ?","2623":"what the ! ? dammit death geno s back at his side checking him for injury or weakness nova sorry to ask but could you get more of the ivs from our house , and maybe a spare set of clothes","2624":"they re often places of worship and not traditionally homes but i was enamored with the style when i crafted this place","2625":"a a many tiered tower you see them in places in japan and india","2626":"souvenirs from battles . . . .","2627":"theyre not literal trophies , more things she took from the battlefield to remember her hardest battles , they definitely had that concept in ancient times","2628":"to be fair a pagoda is probably not something reaper would have encountered before","2629":"looking past nova they see a poster bed a dresser and other amenities . . . . and a room filled with trophies from difficult battles","2630":"you really are an idiot . . . what house doesn t have a chuffing bedroom ? ? ? ?","2631":"well you re still coming back downstairs this is her bedroom and we know how annoying it is to have people just hanging out in your bedroom genos just confused by the bob comment","2632":"yes and no , this is the universe of my birth but not the one i was raised in . think of it like a monster born in underswap taken to underfell as a baby and raised there instead","2633":"yeah my dad calls me lexi , he s still alive but i have to stay away from him for his own safety . if the people who experimented on me found out about him i have no doubt in my mind they would threaten him to reach me","2634":"reaper i think you need more rest","2635":"she chuckles nova still works , it s what i m used to","2636":"that s a new one , though if a demon had just appeared i our bedroom i probably would have freaked out too","2637":"i didn t find it out until much later in my life , the same time i learned about my family line , though the records all say i died during childbirth my name is ashkari od kaihoko te","2638":"yeah i think i m entitled to be lazy for awhile , what happened up here","2639":"of course the anons would bring this up , no nova is the name i gave myself when i escaped the human scientists who had just referred to me by a number for years , i had a name my dad gave me , and then my birth name . . . .","2640":"considering how much she s telling you i wonder if onryotatarigami will tell you her true name","2641":"are you guys ok ? geno finally made it up the stairs , he s still a bit tired out from the walk back","2642":"yeah . . . my mom was the youngest princess of the kaihoko te royal family , but since they re all dead now i guess the throne would be mine , if there was anyone left to rule over","2643":"she chuckles slightly you re looking at the lost princess of a dead race","2644":"sorry just some sort of instinct kicked in , the need to protect those under my watch . . . . this place isn t just my home , technically it s my kingdom","2645":"admin , your character is even more of a trigger happy idiot than angel , and i didn t think that was possible !","2646":"nova guided him out of hell after surprising alastor with her sudden royal behavior , this makes reaper and alastor the only two beings who have actually seen her act as royalty","2647":"nova finally gets to her feet it s october he was doing this to scare me and damn did it work","2648":"reaper stop he was just pranking me !","2649":"when he reaches the th floor nova s still on her ass staring at a portal to hell talking with redeyedradiodemon","2650":"you tried to erase my memory of goth ! ? a scream from floors above them stops geno from continuing yelling what the","2651":"geno sighs from nostalgia things were so much simpler back then . . . even if i did still spend a lot of time on the save screen","2652":"i d forgotten about that picture , it s sweet","2653":"she just thought seeing death flustered and awkward was cute but knows better than to say that","2654":"oh shuddup tsun is blushing","2655":"she chuckles slightly before heading up the stairs","2656":"geno wasn t expecting that and kinda fell on top of reaper","2657":"uh you do know that flame there is meant to keep you warm too right ?","2658":"i m not a fan of trouble","2659":"admin will remember that","2660":"suddenly the letter bursts into violet flames , technically he didn t nova proof it","2661":"geno drapes a blanket over reaper","2662":"admin poofs a letter to reaper , because . . . well . . . you don t have much entertainment in solflare , so i ll create some for you","2663":"yeah she left some along with pillows sure enough each futon now has a pillow and blankets","2664":"you were asleep reaper . he seems somewhat worried about reaper sneezing","2665":"describe your neighborhood !","2666":"no , i walked back , nova says teleporting in this world might not be a good idea since we know so little about it . and if we teleported somewhere far away by accident we might be stuck there","2667":"yeah ? geno s sitting nearby , a small violet flame burns nearby drying reaper s robes","2668":"well geno got them back to nova s pagoda though he needed her help to guide them from the sky","2669":"eventually they end up back on the shore , geno tsking over the fact reaper s now stuck with a soaked robe that cant be good for your health","2670":"https mobile . twitter . com minecraft status","2671":"the pair just float in the water for awhile , the calm waves bobbing them above the surface of the water as geno keeps the god afloat , geno s lone eye is closed this is really peaceful","2672":"sees that onryotatarigami has taken the afterdeath family , meaning that the hybinger is unintentionally and unaware of the fact that she s going exactly according to my plan unspeakable evil intensifies","2673":"i need epic in my life","2674":"lol xd","2675":"what is your favorite lie ?","2676":"reaper , what if you sink ? also your admin makes a good point you still have the iv","2677":"i can but i d be a bit nervous about doing it in a world where we re alone . i mean i think i m the only one here who can swim","2678":"you don t know how to swim also it s an ocean not a lake","2679":"geno just facepalms we re guests here reaper","2680":"reaper i d rather you just get some rest than do something to make me worry about you all over again","2681":"and risk you falling out of the sky mid trip ?","2682":"well i could have gotten it changed much sooner , how much longer do you think you ll need that","2683":"geno set up a new iv for reaper once he realized that was the issue and nova got the supplies","2684":"when reaper wakes back up geno had explained to nova that they needed more ivs and she grabbed some from their house","2685":"geno just gets reaper back in bed you clearly need more rest","2686":"shit ! geno helps reaper up","2687":"great so he probably go lost geno rubs his temple","2688":"well if east is out which direction do you want to go . . . . wait where s gothy ? ! gothofdeaths","2689":"in other words , deathberry is your chara , except his murder is somehow legalized . it also means this berry is less pacifistic than the others , hence his attack and his telling you to shut up","2690":"texts you out of nowhere lol if you wanna know about reaper berry . . . he s the god of premature death , meaning he reaps people before their time . as such , reaper swap keeps him under surveillance or locked up in their timeline since the reaperswap gods aren t exactly approving of berry s role","2691":"do shooting stars have the power to fulfill wishes ?","2692":"my father was never here , my mother . . . all i know id although i was born here she brought me to my dad back on earth to have him raise me she decides to tag along , this is the most she s really spoken about this place","2693":"wonder what a vesra is","2694":"the scientists don t live in this universe , they live in the one i grew up in . i was born here but i never really even saw this world until adulthood . i don t really know much either besides what i ve explored personally . . .","2695":". . . to the east is vesra . . . please stay away from there . . . she looks sad","2696":"is he gonna need those changed cause nova does not keep that kind of medical supplies on hand","2697":"yeah , i mean if you go west you ll reach the shoreline , north is plains and eventually mountains , south is a large desert i haven t fully checked out . i don t know how to get there from the ground though and you don t look up for flying what about east ?","2698":"if you go outside be careful , it s easy to lose your way in the jungle","2699":"they will get so lost if they go outside , the pagoda is in the center of a dense jungle and since her main method of traveling is flying there arent any trails","2700":"where would we go , i mean we know nothing about this world and if we return to our multiverse we can t get back without nova s help","2701":"what is at the same time funny and sad ?","2702":"i mean . . . that s fair","2703":"geno just collapses back to a seated position don t scare me like that , i was actually getting some decent sleep for the first time in months","2704":"you

actually trembling , geno might be in shock to see reaper actually shrink down and act afraid when he s nearly fearless j just have a few bad memories here . . if you can deal with yours then . . i should be able to deal with mine . . besides . . i m not alone here . . he gives a faint smile","1969":"reaper nods though he seemed really uncomfortable , he was visibly gripping at his arms . . y yeah . . he keeps a close eye on geno to see what part of this ancient house he travels to , if you know a lot about ancient greece their houses were made of stone , gasters home looked just like one of those old buildings only more in the style of classic sans and paps home , meaning the layout of the house was similar , the kitchen and bedrooms were all in the same area","1970":"reaper then takes geno by the hand and teleports off to a place in reapertale that they ve only seen briefly , it was a house that belonged to gaster , the god of magic , reaper was actually going to let geno see everything . . you remember i took us here to hide out for a bit ? . . i didn t let you look around the place since . . there was a few things i wanted to keep hidden . . but . . i think you ll get why i act the way i do if i let you see it . .","1971":"you knew ? here i thought i hid it . . . though i honestly didn t see a difference between taking from the living or dead . . nobody here has ever said anything to me about it . . . reaper then gets a more serious look and his blue eyelight vanished . . but . . i did live a lot differently than the other gods here and other sans . . i can show you what i mean by that . . if your up for it","1972":". . yeah . . don t remind me . . reaper frowned a bit . . but the gods here are all like that . . our frisk even flirts with me and with chara . . i don t know what the heii is wrong with them . . . . anyway . . it s also completely okay to take things from other timelines . . i asked before i swiped what i have from the monsters and humans i ve reaped and everyone said it was completely fine . . he then holds up his cellphone everything we have , i took from a monster or human i reaped . . here we don t have the same tech all the other timelines have . . the only reason our house does is cause i ve took it all from various aus . . nobody aside from me and painless know what cellphones are . .","1973":". . you mean you wanna know everything about our timeline ? you know , it s your timeline too now , you can say ours , you live here right along with me reaper gives a smile though . . there s a few things about timeline you might not like . . for instance it s completely okay here for all the gods to have multiple husbands or wives . . but i know you wouldn t be okay with that and i don t exactly wanna share you either . .","1974":"reaper then hugs him can t say i know what that s like but i do know it isn t easy for you to talk about the past . . you don t have to bring it up if it makes you upset . . you do have me , the kiddos and painless now if that helps , none of us want you upset love","1975":"reaper still looked somewhat confused but he does take a seat beside geno , he wasn t gonna say no to his tsun offering a seat next to him geno ?","1976":"lol he did feel really warm but it wasn t because of a fever , it was because he started blushing though it would be funny if geno mistook it as he had a fever uhh . . what are you . . ? reaper stares at his tsun looking confused","1977":"that is pretty shocking for reaper to admit that , almost makes you wonder if he s ill , he never asks let alone admit to needing help he then folded his arms and darts his lone eyelight away from geno . . n no . . maybe . . a little . . ? just . . i don t understand everything like you do . .","1978":"reaper sighs okay . . maybe your right then . . maybe i am teaching them the wrong things . . but . . he looks away from geno . . i i honestly . . don t know how to behave . . i never had a family or anyone with me before . . we don t use gold here in reapertale either . . and in the timelines i went reaping in , nobody ever said it was wrong to just take things off the people i ve reaped . . i i m trying to say . . i might . . actually need your help . .","1979":". . i know classics mettaton has some problems but i didn t think they were that crazy . . i m kinda afraid of the other mettatons now . .","1980":"hey , hey ! so i maybe taught the kiddo to behave more violently and taught them stealing was okay but . . okay that sounded worse when it s said out loud . . but i don t take responsibility for that robot , that robot was clearly insane like classics mettaton","1981":"relax love reaper then nuzzles geno","1982":"you okay there love ? reaper then hugs his tsundere","1983":"how the heii does that work ?","1984":"uh . . well . . it s not like the monster who had it needs it anymore . . makes you realize why their kiddos have poor morals not just cause they were in underfell neither","1985":"good enough for me ! your so cute when your angry","1986":"try and make me reaper just smirks","1987":". . . fiiiinnne . . but after i do that , will we get to have fun time ?","1988":"how about we seriously go back to our bedroom ? mod is facepalming","1989":"that would not surprise me . . if he ran up to dust like that . . he would walk up to nightmare trying to offer him girl scout cookies . .","1990":". . you look so hot right now reaper then wraps his arms around geno , really ? is now the time for this ?","1991":"i ll take that as a yes . . you think you would of learned by now that some of the stuff you say would tick off the wrong person","1992":"i think it is . . what if something goes wrong and we aren t there ? they ll be the first ones to bite the dust","1993":"sorell behaves similar to shino and i find them both disappointing . . he has a scythe and refuses to use it period even if he s in danger while shino thinks she can solve the world s problems by drawing and giving hugs . . . gothy on the other hand knows he can t do that and will fight when it s needed plus he has no health problems unlike the others","1994":"what are you even doing here ? someone else kiii you kiddo ?","1995":"uhhh . . sorry love . . reaper nervously rubs the back of his skull i didn t mean it that way . . and . . i m still sorry about that . .","1996":"reaper walked over to answer the door don t you know that death lives here ? huh ? aren t you that goat kid i reaped ?","1997":"simple , nobody other than geno and myself knew about silver and sorell so i dumped them off into another timeline and erased genos memory of them , the fell brothers caught me trying to dump raven off at their house though which made things complicated . . they didn t want him there especially after the last i dropped off . . so i had to let raven stay half with my brother and half with the fells , i convinced my bro that raven was life paps kiddo who needed a babysitter from time to time , he completely bought it and started calling raven his kiddo imagine his shock when he found out the truth . . my god death","1998":"i wasn t in my right mind when i had hatred , if i could actually think rationally i would of picked somewhere else but the hatred made me want to send them to a timeline they would get kiiied in , be lucky i managed to pick underfell instead of a place like axetale","1999":"reaper just blinks uh . . i get the feeling i shouldn t have said that . . .","2000":"maybe if you weren t all sunshine and rainbows and could wield a scythe . . and didn t have bones so brittle that just holding a scythe would make your arms fall off","2001":"oh sh t shino overheard him reaper looks over at shino when he heard her speak uh . . how long have you been there ? it s not that i don t love you kiddo but gothy is my favorite , he s just a little better than you omg","2002":"w who said i was nervous ! ? reaper then starts fumbling with the strings on his robe i i was just thinking of having a date later . .","2003":"ow , hey ! reaper rubs his skull lol is that a yes or a no ?","2004":"uh . . . reaper looks horribly nervous now i m pretty sure he was . . your memory is still having trouble huh ?","2005":"what ? gothy just happens to be better than the other , you gotta admit you love him more than the others too really . . ?","2006":"you and paps stopped that one geno is probably gonna end up swatting him reaper grins nervously instead of me just dumping a kiddo in underfell like i did the last time . . paps suggested a babysitter with gothy . . you being friends with fell paps called him up to see goth and had him babysit so we could have time to ourselves , i could of erased your memory no problem but erasing fell paps , his brother and my brothers memory was a problem . . i didn t get away with that one . . goth ended up coming back . . and well . . if i m honest , i m kinda glad he did , i ended up loving him more than the other kiddos incoming slap across the face","2007":"oh . . well uh . . . reaper sweats a bit and rubs the back of his skull nervously i don t know what brought this up but . . . i know i wasn t completely in my right mind when i did that . . and . . i tried to completely erase everything about them from your memory . .","2008":"dontcallmesans lol","2009":"oh hey love wondered where you ran off to , but uh . . talk about what ? a new date maybe","2010":"what s there to do ? we have plenty of time to figure things out love , everything s calmed down in the multiverse right now reaper then nuzzles geno","2011":"but you love me","2012":"reaper blushes dark blue uhhh . . . t that wasn t a bad thing though . . was it ?","2013":"uh . . weeelll . . its obvious that reaper did it lol","2014":"how do i put it ? it went something like this if i m being honest here , i just wanted to get geno in bed i didn t plan to actually have kiddos , neither one of us did , you can say we had little accidents","2015":"reaper then teleports them both to thegoddessoflife","2016":"uh . . this isn t a prank is it ? reaper sweats a bit and places a hand on genos shoulder the only healer we have here is life or asgore which asgore is kinda busy right now . . you want me to contact life ?","2017":"i guarantee the kiddo is faking this , watch him wake up in the next minutes and say this was all a prank . .","2018":"what the heii is a ferry ? reaper just looks confused , right , he s from ancient times , he won t know what that is","2019":"okay , if your that worried i ll let you check but i m coming with you reaper frowned as he let geno free from his hug","2020":"huh . . i didn t know that . . reaper just blinks well it explains why not all sans are exactly like you now . . i think that s the only thing i didn t know about you . .","2021":"huh ? raven ? reaper does loosen his hug but he looks confused is this about the anons earlier ? i think he s faking it . . him and gothy do a lot of pranks you know","2022":"not all of us are bi , i mean i am but . . i don t know ! reaper looks uncomfortable just talking about this and hides behind dontcallmesans geeennoo ! !","2023":"reaper seems all happy now and hugs geno like this i m so happy ! i was scared i d give you food poisoning !","2024":"you might wanna hide that detail from cross unless you want a elf skinned alive","2025":"uuhhh . . . reaper nervously pulls on his robe since unlike geno , he is bi so that made him very uncomfortable lol his whole skull was now blue so that s like something all elves in your world wear ? you might wanna keep that robe covered when your traveling around our multiverse , just saying it s a little different here","2026":"reaper starts blushing bright blue uh . . does that mean i did good ? i i m not that easy to tease !","2027":"twt that s nice to know . . reaper makes that exact face and lowers his skull geeennnooo","2028":"that s shocking . . uh . . kiddo ? you uh . . do you see what your wearing ? reaper points at her chest dontcallmesans is going to take those pancakes he made and hit him with it you might wanna put some clothes on","2029":"i its not that , i don t know if you want to . . reaper looks horribly nervous i didn t burn it too bad ?","2030":"uh . . . whoops . . well , he is on my list of souls to reap so if he does do that i ll have to go reap him","2031":"so that s why you pulled him out of here , you know , with his memory , i don t think it d be that hard to distract him , so what aus are you after this time ?","2032":"you uh sure you don t want grillbys ? reaper is a bit nervous since he knows his cooking skills are , well , terrible , if there is a way to burn something , he will find it","2033":"we know this but reaper is known to tease people xd","2034":"i uh . . your death or not doesn t change that i m another version of them . . i don t know what to do or say here . . reaper looks horribly confused with the basket , he isn t used to being treated that nicely , at all usually have people trying to attack me or bite my skull off . . not . . . .","2035":"heh , weren t you just nagging me for going soft ? now your going to erase a whole au just to protect a single papyrus ? reaper smirks","2036":"error ? well now i know where ink went","2037":"w who said there was any damage ? reaper smiles nervously just . . if the pancakes are too burned i can grab you grillbys instead","2038":". . uhhh . . reaper chuckled nervously yeah . . still didn t turn out like i d hope . . he tries to lie but geno usually sees through him xd he didn t set the entire house on fire but the kitchen . . you might wanna stay out of there","2039":"reaper looks at the basket with his blue eye turning huge uhhhh . . . are you sure this is meant for me ? i i m death ! you know , the guy that takes your soul when you die ? why would you give death a present ?","2040":"well , on top of getting some rest i also made breakfast reaper motions to their nightstand where you see a plate full of heavily burned pancakes that look more like tires off a car than food and there was a dead flower in a small vase , well at least he tried to make it special","2041":"morning love someone s a sleepy head reaper chuckled a bit for once you didn t have any nightmares , maybe i scared them off","2042":"thanks i think ? uh sorry i insulted your boyfriend i think ? being death you aren t exactly good with conversations . . reaper chuckled out of being nervous","2043":"huh ? reaper was a bit confused and does walk over to open their door when he heard knocking who you again ? i m kinda surprised . . i thought you were p ssed at me","2044":"yeah but it s fine , you might wanna go before error pulls you out of here","2045":"okay good point , with your memory i doubt you even remember what we were talking about now","2046":". . i m sure the kiddo is fine , you might not know them but i do , they do a skeleton of pranks all the time and cause a sh t ton of trouble , it s probably just another one of his pranks reaper then sits back down beside geno who is still sound asleep i m not letting the kiddos cause more trouble for us","2047":"don t know what a guru is but i d say it s geno","2048":"that was me","2049":"i i said i m not jealous . . ! reaper then hides his skull by pulling down his hood , yeah sure he s not jealous of their own kids","2050":"reapers entire skull is now flushed blue h hey ! ! what s wrong with loving you ! ? i i m not jealous !","2051":"uh . . what gave you that idea ? reaper blushed a bit as he clings onto dontcallmesans i just love cuddling my geno","2052":"live like we normally do ? in reapertale , electricity and things like that don t exist so . . i d just have to go back to how things were this pic is cute","2053":"oh . . well he can kiss deaths ! ! mod facepalms","2054":"it was a edit of this pic xd reaper looks like a shy guy lol hey i am not shy ! who the heii is mario ! ? uh . . .","2055":". . sorry . . reaper is now fumbling with the strings on his robes i don t fully get emotions yet . . . but i wasn t , you know , trying to do that . . didn t know it hurt others . .","2056":"reaper looks confused i don t understand . . she seemed pretty upset over my jokes . .","2057":"geno tried to silence reaper by shoving pie in his mouth when she started to leave xd","2058":"but he comes with a bag full o oomph ! ? reaper finds himself with a spoonful of pie afterwards before he could make another horrible bag joke lol he blinks and stares up at geno","2059":"he comes with a lot of baggage i wouldn t be surprised if you just made amra not like you pfft okay i ll give him some credit , stores can be real villains when they make a kiiiing off bags , that s real genius","2060":"oh . . whoops . . i didn t even know you were in the room . . i might need to rest like geno said . . reaper nervously rubs his skull","2061":"pfft okay i said i wouldn t make fun of the kiddo but . . come on , your gonna put goggles over your paper bag ? guess it s hard to see your luggage reaper","2062":". . i think i m still out of sorts , i don t even remember you coming here . . reaper holds his skull how d you even know i was having trouble with life ? i i mean i appreciate you wanting to help don t get me wrong i m just still kinda out of it","2063":"reaper just smiles okay , i ll be good","2064":"i think a llama threw him out of his house so he said alpaca the bags and bagged himself reaper snickers","2065":"maybe when he was taking out the trash he threw himself in reaper stop poor flug you must have a thing for garbage bags","2066":"doesn t he have a paper bag for a head ? you said he never takes it off reaper snickers he could easily help you with shopping just ask him to bag things for you , that s one in the bag omg","2067":"you admit it ? aw . . i need to record that next time reaper happily takes the spoonful of pie and winks at geno the only thing sweeter than pie is you i love you too","2068":"when you need a paper towel you can just rip off his head and dry your hands off ! reaper just laughs i wonder if he ll throw in the bag after !","2069":"reaper seems relieved geno helped him lay back down and takes a few minutes to catch his breath t thanks love . . i he pauses and started blushing bright blue when geno asked if he needed help with the pie , he s just little low on magic but not low enough that he s dying but he will act like he is if it means he gets babied and coddled by his tsun xd m maybe ? he now has a huge grin on his face you love me","2070":"that is probably a good thing i don t think he d take that well on the downside he finds his husband laying on his side coughing into the couch with a hand gripping onto the arm of the couch , well good news is they aren t under attack for once xd","2071":"i wonder if they say the same about toilet paper mod is very sorry","2072":". . okay okay . . reaper frowned and just slumps back down into the couch . . sorry . . . can nova even share magic like that . . ?","2073":"lol he fell asleep from reapers story telling though the poor guy might get woken up when he hears his yandere coughing , geno did unfortunately fall asleep on the end of the couch beside reaper meanwhile the death god grips the arm of the couch as he tries to calm himself down . . wheeze i i didn t . . think . . i used up . . t that much magic . . man i m tired . .","2074":"h hey ! ! limbo isn t the same as kiiiing , your not dead or alive , your trapped in between so your ageless and unable to die an reaper suddenly starts hacking and turns himself over on the couch so his back is facing towards you as he coughed into the couch , mama geno is probably gonna throw you out of their house","2075":"wait hold on a minute . . your in love with guys that wear paper bags over their heads ? i bet they come in handy for bagging things pfft ! i bet they re the type to use tea bags reaper","2076":". . not that that s a bad thing , i didn t find myself interesting to talk about . . reaper didn t even inform geno about chara wrecking havoc in his timeline , he learned later after they had goth xd","2077":"i didn t have a choice . . i used to visit him whenever i could between work , i think i would visit once every week ? until the incident with chara happened . . then i was gone for a few years . . after everything settled down i went back to him and discovered he was gone . . that s when i ran around looking for him until i found him in classics timeline on the surface","2078":"uh . . well life did bang your father so flirting with geno while still with her doesn t seem that bad in all honesty now that i think about it . . i think your right , it s just so many years ago my memory is kind of scrambled . . i know i didn t tell geno about life though . . i didn t tell him anything about myself or my timeline period . . i just stayed there to listen to him and keep him company . . originally i was sent there to reap him but . . we started talking to eachother and just clicked . . i got along with him better than any of the other gods in my timeline life included . .","2079":"reaper god daammmeeettt wait i am god i damn this word learn to type so i don t look stupid mod ! xd sorry but you look stupid on your own i will reap you . . .","2080":"bagheads ? reaper looks confused i dunno kiddo , one of the hods here made a being from rock and stone that has emotions and it doesn t seem to affect anything , i would try it with at least one of your machines so you aren t so alone but you said you have people after all so . . i dunno . . who are they anyway ?","2081":"reaper looks completely shocked i uh . . thank you ? i think that s what your supposed to say . . uhm . . i m not used to this . . even when me and the version of you here got along she didn t do anything like this for me . .","2082":"yep , our relationship ended right there . . things weren t the same since then . . i only retold the story here so geno wouldn t panic as much . . though he probably still will panic knowing how much of a toll it s taking on me . . reaper chuckled a bit it probably would of been a lot quicker and easier if i just let someone else give her magic instead of me being her polar opposite . . but at the time , i felt it was my responsibility to be the one to help her . . though my magic didn t agree with me . . i was weakened enough that i wasn t able to work for a while . . i m honestly surprised i didn t fall down or anything when i gave her magic like that . . especially when our magic isn t compatible with eachother . . she s life and i m death , it took years for me to force my magic to help her . . it wasn t easy either let me tell you . . . . i took some heavy backlash from it . . only difference is . . i have someone looking out for me now when i m in trouble he smiles at dontcallmesans their story is pretty sad , he did so much for her only for her to turn around and despise him for it , he sacrificed a lot for life","2083":"okkaaayy maybe it s a little more serious than i said but i d still say it s a small deal . . i think i should probably tell you the full story of how i brought her back the first time around . . it s a long story but i ll try to cut it short i m gonna try putting the comic in order and before anyone asks the reason life flowers can only revive life is because it s giving her her own magic back , she created them with her magic so if you shatter one , it releases her magic trapped inside and gives it back to her , reaper still ended up having to give her magic afterwards since she wasn t fully back to normal , but due to them being exact opposites of eachother , it took him years to do it solo , his magic isn t compatible with hers and with nova , if anyone remembers , reaper had no more life flowers on him , he was basically screwed and had to hope that nova could revive her without using one","2084":"it s not entirely bad , you do give life to those machines right ? they wouldn t be there without you , they re kinda like a kiddo you d have to teach things to , they could probably keep you company if you think of it that way heh . . death isn t exactly someone you d think would give a positive speech , guess this makes it death defying reaper chuckled","2085":"h hey , hey , you didn t do anything wrong love , i would of done the exact same thing in your place , if you didn t do it , i probably would have , either way we would have the same situation . . reaper forces a smile i just . . tried to revive her on my own . . i thought it would spare anyone else from having to risk themselves . . but . . my powers aren t exactly . . meant to do anything like this . . so . . i kinda ended up like this . . it s not a big deal , just needed some rest and i m back up again","2086":"lol burned xd thegoddessoflife reaper just blinks i don t think i ve ever met another toriel . . i m gonna guess geno told you about the version of you here ?","2087":"reaper stares up at geno when he heard his voice though he now looks horribly nervous . . . . that s . . not life . . ? w well . . . that would of been shocking as heii if it was . . how did classic toriel get here ? he s trying to change the subject are you okay ?","2088":". . so after you ran away , where do you stay now ? you just wander around the multiverse ?","2089":"reaper starts waking back up after toriel used her healing magic on him and looks around . . life ? ? he s confused normal tori for life how . . ? ? i thought . . but . . my magic . . it s not even for healing or reviving anyone . . last time it took years for it to do anything to help you . . was i knocked out for years ! ? how are you ! ? dontcallmesans he just told on himself , he wasn t like this from injuries , he s like this from magic loss , from pouring his magic into lifes soul to try and revive her on his own","2090":"dontcallmesans seeing geno freak out makes me feel bad the poor smol","2091":"aw when he was brought to the couch he immediately laid down on it and closed his eye sockets , he was out pretty quick . . even with knowing there was a stranger at their door , he couldn t keep himself up . .","2092":"reaper then lays his skull against genos shoulder and started falling asleep on him right then and there , i don t think he meant for you to use him to rest on mnhh . .","2093":"j just a minute . . ! reaper looks at dontcallmesans geno ? i can t see to get the door right now . .","2094":"oh . . that ? don t worry love , she s being revived as we speak , everything is all okay right now . . just don t tell the other gods about it , asgore still has feelings for her so if word reaches him , he would flip out . . reaper would have collapsed right there if not for geno holding him by the shoulders , he could feel the death god drop in his hands where are we . . ?","2095":"reaper then looks up at his tsun seeing geno had snapped back to normal when he started worrying about his yandere , it made him smile a bit your too cute . . okaay . . . i won t sleep . . yet . . but . . really tired . .","2096":"it took a while , i ve never been to the save screen at the time so it wasn t exactly the easiest place to find . . but in the end , i m happy i did i met the love of my life","2097":"reaper looks surprised or . . well , it s hard to tell when all you see is his skull bobbing up and down with his eyes struggling to stay open , it looks like he s having trouble focusing on geno w what ? nothing love . . just tired . . kiiier are deaths hours . . i could sleep like this . .","2098":"error finds everyone annoying so don t take it personal reaper chuckled faintly though that s good to know , at least i didn t break as many rules as i thought . . but even if that did happen , i d probably just erase your memory so you d forget about it","2099":"hmn ? reaper then rubbed his eye sockets , he wasn t still injured but geno may not believe that given how he s acting i m fine love . . just dead tired . . and . . . . who turned out the lights ? it s getting dark in here . .","2100":"i thought my name was reaper not okay . . reaper then leaned himself against geno , oddly that didn t sound like he was joking . . how ve you been holding up ?","2101":"huh . . but i did take him away to reapertale after he was freed from the save screen due to that pie he ate and put him in limbo which caused him to go back to his original state . . which i thought broke all of those rules . . by the way , when did you get here ?","2102":"so . . let me get this straight , your family is evil enough you had to fake your death in order to get away from them and change how you look ? talk about rough . . reaper then leans against dontcallmesans","2103":"you know the robot gothy had following him around ? this is the one who made hi ngh . . reaper suddenly pauses as he held his skull . . geno ?","2104":"hey , don t worry about it love . . like i said before , it means you still have someone you care about reaper just smiles though he looks . . unwell . . wasn t he just healed ?","2105":"geno ? ! reaper turned around to face his tsun your awake ? ? you okay love ? ?","2106":"reaper then simply taps you so you d dust whoops my finger slipped","2107":"reaper is seen talking with a certain elf whose robot goth decided to corrupt , but he s gonna try and act as though everything is completely fine so to not worry or freak out geno , actually the tsun might punch him if he overhears their conversation","2108":"well kiddo , i m literal death , either way , i m not exactly a hero or villain so it s not like i d care . . others might but me and my family ? nope . . though that does explain why you look completely different now","2109":"oof it s taking reaper a while to come back though if geno heard half of what his yandere just said , his worry would be replaced with anger and he d slap the heii out of him","2110":"uh . . . nevermind . . geno isn t like a zombie but horror is , he eats brains reaper just stop talking","2111":"i wouldn t say that . . then again , if you look at horror , he s like a zombie geno would slap the heii out of you","2112":"your the one who owns that robot ! ? you look way different from your last visit . . reaper chuckled a bit sorry about goth though , the kiddos a handful . . he caused quite a mess . .","2113":"true . . but other than that they re pretty much the same , right ?","2114":"lol i thought she would smack him if she heard him xd her and amra both would since he s saying elves and harbringers are the same","2115":". . doesn t nova have ears like that ?","2116":"wait wait . . what ? reaper looks shocked she looks a little different than what i remember . . you sure ?","2117":"oh . . so your one of gothys friends ? he does live here , i m kinda surprised your brave enough to come all the way to reapertale to visit him reaper then leaves the door open you can come in","2118":"reaper is downstairs answering their door so he s unable to hear geno but for the tsun , it might seem like his yandere had vanished , he wasn t in the room and didn t come running when his name was called but his scythe were still there","2119":"reaper sets geno in bed and goes to answer the door who s brave enough to knock on deaths door ?","2120":"when geno wakes he finds himself now laying in bed instead of with reaper , actually . . his yandere seemed to be out of sight but his scythe was seen laying against the wall by their bed","2121":"yeah i knew they have their own twitter sans au xd yes that s a thing and here s what twitter sans looks like","2122":". . not necessarily , i can still wipe their memories if any of them start to suspect anything . . but . . i won t lie . . it would be pretty difficult to bring her back with our powers being the exact opposite of eachother . . last time i did this it took years . . literal years . . my powers aren t meant to give life , they re meant to take life . . reaper sighs my bro had to lie for me since i was weakened to the point i couldn t actually do my job . . he told everyone i was busy with work . . paps doesn t usually lie so they all bought it . .","2123":"president geno has a nice ring to it","2124":"i guess i m just not used to relying on others yet . . reaper looks down at the sleeping geno in his arms i still struggle with just letting geno help me . . it s not something i m used to . . before we met i did everything on my own . . if i were injured or in trouble , i had to figure out a way to get myself out of it . . i never had anyone to rely on before . . and now that i do . . i i don t know how to act . . is it even okay to have people help you like this ? his blue eyelight then vanished from sight . .","2125":". . i said a couple of them already but i m guessing your wanting to know the whole list . . well , like i said , not being with mortals is a rule we re supposed to follow since . . well , think about it , we re immortal , we would outlive anyone we went with outside of reapertale . . that s a huge fear i had with geno . . it led me to break the second rule of not being allowed to put anyone in limbo . . i have the power to make others immortal but i m not supposed to use it . . if i did that for everyone , not only would it make my whole job entirely pointless but it would plunge the whole multiverse into total chaos , everyone would think it s okay to do whatever the heii they want since nothing you do will cause any harm , at least that s how everyone would see it , there would be nonstop violence . . that goes along with not being allowed to alter someone s fate or change timelines , if i decided to change nightmare and dreams au for example , and reap everyone there or decided to just flat out kiii nightmare before he became the nightmare we know today , it could have some disastrous effects . . dream could become a villain seeking vengeance for one . . it s just something we aren t supposed to do . . i m also not allowed to let anyone take my scythe , if you get ahold of mine or my brothers scythe it gives anyone the power to reap souls and to kiii us gods . . that weapon is powerful and in the wrong hands , as seen with chara . . it can be a disaster . . us gods also aren t allowed to fight eachother , our powers colliding can cause catastrophic damage to whatever place we re fighting in and if we happen to kiii eachother , it screws up the entire balance of the multiverse , for example if i died , there would be nobody around that s able to reap in my place , souls that die in dying timelines or in timelines being erased by error will be erased and die with it with no chance to be saved , that monster will be permanently gone , their code wiped from existence , reaping them saves them from that fate","2126":"hmn . . let s see . . gods aren t allowed to be with mortals . . broke that one we aren t allowed to change other timelines , broke that one too i m not allowed to put others in limbo , that makes rules i ve broken . . i m not allowed to alter someone s fate , which i did with geno . . so rules ? each god has their own set of rules they need to follow , if they break those rules depending on how many and how serious the rules that were broken , you can end up executed , exiled or even locked away for eternity , when you get banished or exiled , your stripped away of your powers and never allowed to come back . . so it can be pretty serious . .","2127":". . i thought he wasn t comfortable staying with me yet . . at least that s what he told me . . it could of really been that but . . i didn t think it was . .","2128":"wait . . why s he on the save screen ? ? reaper seemed confused for a moment but started grinning afterwards nevermind i think i know exactly why he went there , this dream keeps getting better and better i m coming geno ! probably scarring the kid for life , reaper rips off his robe , throwing it over the kiddo and leaps out the window , good news is he is a skeleton with no body parts xd","2129":"where s the donut city i was eating ! ? who are you ! ? where s bikini geno ! ? i have no words players reaction is accurate","2130":"snrk ! reaper actually snorts and jumps awake , toppling over knocking code to reality over with him evil donut ! ! ! aaaaa ! ! !","2131":"reaper starts nomming on the poor kiddos sleeve xd . . . thish daonut . . taest . . fooneh . . nom . . mod facepalms","2132":"reaper once healed starts hugging the child , though he s still asleep he isn t in bad condition anymore xd you can

mention of geno . .","2134":"i think mama geno just lost his cool ooooh sh t the death god was so out of it he didn t even notice geno had left","2135":". . . reaper let out a sneeze then nuzzles his face into genos leg , mama geno is not a happy geno","2136":"reaper even though he is completely out cold , he wraps his arms around his tsuns waist and lays his skull on genos lap although his bones felt ice cold to touch poor geno is trying so hard to keep calm","2137":"oof the death god had been knocked out for days now , it would be shocking if geno were able to keep calm through that , it doesn t help he s still out cold either","2138":"i now want this to be a meme lol","2139":"xd he just pulled a papyrus wait as big as asgore is , would he even fit through a window ? i think he just made a giant hole in the wall he had to fix probably freaking out the poor goat dad he finds his son out cold on the bed where geno had left him in order to seek help , honestly just looking at him you would mistake him for being on his death bed , his bones were a dull grey and he was breathing rapidly","2140":"reaper actually cuddles up to geno and rests himself against his tsuns chest , you don t hear any answer from him but you can hear him breathing rapidly , his bones shaking with each breath he takes . .","2141":"that s the same reaction i had . . reaper chuckled but his laughter made him start coughing and he ends up leaning himself against geno . . d mn . .","2142":"how do i put this . . ? you know asriel and chara ? yesterday i think . . i had to go reaping in a au called storyshift , the asriel and chara were slain there . . i was just about to reap their souls but . . i didn t expect to be hit by golden flames . . reaper holds up his wrist that were burned her powers being the opposite of mine . . it deals a heii of a lot of damage to me . . if i were a normal monster i wouldn t of taken it so bad . .","2143":"reaper starts waking back up not long after and looks up at geno what why do i feel a little better . . ? guessing it had something to do with my guardian angel thanks love . . o oh , right , almost forgot , i was gonna tell you what happened . . guess there s no point in hiding it . . these marks . . aren t exactly from the monster i was sent to reap . . rather it s from someone we know . . but before i say it , you gotta promise me you won t freak out , i don t want you rushing off in attack mode when you just recovered from using blaster beasts . .","2144":"geno is really freaking out , the poor tsun reaper meanwhile seems to have zoned out but not all is lost since epic did drop off his own set of medical supplies separate from theirs , his supply bag probably has everything geno is looking for","2145":". . i if . . i can . . s stay awake . . long enough . . to tell . . . you . . reaper then closed his eye sockets i feel . . tired . .","2146":"reaper then reaches his hand out to hold one of genos though he only managed to grab his tsuns sleeve , he s trying to calm him but he s failing miserably geno . . trust me . . nothing compares to the injuries you got . . i ll be okay . .","2147":"w what . . ? reapers eye sockets open slightly as he scans the room , noticing his robe had been moved and seeing that geno saw the wounds on his bones i i m . . okay . . calm down . . love . . just . . need some rest . . his voice sounded quiet and awfully hoarse","2148":"geno shouting like that actually managed to wake reaper a bit , his eye sockets open just enough you can faintly see his blue eyelight . . mnhh . . . ?","2149":"heh . . i didn t think i missed that much work . . reaper then lays his arms over genos shoulders and lays into him , his skull buried in his tsuns chest , he laughs faintly from the pun . . i don t think . . i can walk . .","2150":"reaper pokes his skull up to look up at geno , the god looks really tired and had a hard time keeping his eye sockets open , he even forgot to text geno y yeah . . he then reaches up for his tsuns hand","2151":"reaper had taken off after his date with geno to catch up on reaping , he returns a few days later looking extremely exhausted and collapses on the floor . . define good . .","2152":"reaper really doesn t notice he has frosting all over himself and proceeds to eat his donuts , making even more of a mess , there was frosting now on the picnic basket and starting to get on his robe i d say this is a good date it s peaceful and i get to spend time with the love of my life","2153":"reaper just blinks , staring at geno with a confused look on his face i do ? it s fine love , it s probably only a little , how about we skip to having those burgers now ? he then pulls a burger from out of the basket with a bottle of ketchup and hands it to geno","2154":"oh ! okay love reaper then wipes off genos face with his sleeve , he doesn t seem to mind he still has a splattered donut on his own face though and now on his sleeve i brought everything we like , ketchup and burgers for my love and donuts for me","2155":"napkin ? reaper looks confused now you need a nap already ? i i mean . . if your not feeling that great we can do this later . . mod facepalms","2156":"reaper smiles nervously it s hard to control it . . anyway , let s get back to our date . . and get the donuts off my dates face he starts wiping off genos face with his sleeve or i could lick you clean seriously ?","2157":"huh ? what do you mean its reaper then noticed he wasn t holding anything and started blushing out of sheer embarrassment uhhh . . . i i ll be right back ! he then teleports away for a few minutes and comes back with the actual basket , though the handle breaks , causing the basket to fall on the bed and launch a couple donuts into their faces uhm . . . w well , now i can say your even sweeter than before","2158":"and to top it all off i brought your picnic basket reaper then holds up his hand like he was holding something but it was empty , he was too busy smiling to notice he forgot the basket","2159":"aw reaper happily hugs his tsundere back , he felt proud of himself for getting geno to smile i ll take that as you like it , it s not exactly the same as being outside but it s close , right ?","2160":"that s what i had on me though , anyway you can take it off now reaper seems all proud of himself when geno takes off the blindfold , he sees cardboard trees colored green with crayon hammered into the walls with cardboard clouds with them and green confetti was sprinkled all over the floor to look like grass","2161":"reaper then puts a blindfold on geno does he seriously just carry around a blindfold on him ? wait here , no peeking either geno then hears reaper teleporting quite a bit all over the room and you hear him hammering things into the walls","2162":"how reaper gets geno to talk , start blaming himself and cry like a baby xd reaper then nuzzles his tsun i can fix that , by making new , happier memories , i know your probably too tired for going out . . but . . what if i brought outside to you ?","2163":"you sure ? reaper actually starts tearing up your the one person i really don t wanna hurt love . . if somethings wrong . . .","2164":"but . . reaper just gives him a saddened look . . i don t wanna upset you on accident . . i i know i m not exactly good when it comes to dealing with emotions . . especially now that i actually have them . . . . i didn t . . do anything to hurt you . . did i ? he nervously rubs his arm i can t always tell if i did something wrong . .","2165":". . if you barely remembered it i don t think you d have that look . . reaper frowned . . . i thought it was my job to be the grim one here . . you know if you ever want to , i can take you to visit with him . .","2166":"reaper then walks over and sits beside him i don t know how to describe it . . you seemed . . really grim when asgore came over to help us . . you sure everything is okay ?","2167":"geno . . reaper gives him a concerned look . .","2168":"thanks asgore , i think . . reaper looks really confused and just stands there nervously rubbing his arm . . uhm . . i i m not exactly sure how to act right now . . . .","2169":"yeah , i think . . reaper just blinks . . but i m worried about geno . . he doesn t seem okay . .","2170":"reaper just looks confused . . i i feel like i should be embarrassed and worried and i don t know why ! ! s sorry asgore or . . i really don t know what to call you . . is this normal ? ? he buries his skull into his hands it s hard when you actually feel things . .","2171":"love . . but reaper gives him a worried look i worry about you , you know . .","2172":"h hey , you okay love ? reaper looks worried . . i uh . . i i m not used to this . . . . i don t know how to respond . .","2173":"reaper just looks up at asgore , you know seeing him like this with his dad really makes it hard to see him as this scary powerful god of death lol they told you ?","2174":"reaper is now currently blushing bright blue out of sheer embarrassment since he was scooped up and being hugged by asgore who is his dad , yes in reapertale asgore and gaster are both his parents since they both created him uhm . . ! !","2175":"reaper actually looks embarrassed and blushes bright blue since geno is right there lol he hugs him back uhh . . . thanks dad ? how did uhm . . you know i was in trouble ? reaper then looks back at dontcallmesans d don t ever mention this . .","2176":"aw lol ink is probably screaming since he just repaired their house reaper jumps a bit when he hears asgore screaming asgore . . ! ?","2177":"reaper rubs his eye socket , he clearly isn t fully functioning yet or he wouldn t be willingly telling all of this . . . goths robot threw one at me . . i ll be okay love . . i was really scared when i got up and saw you laying on the floor like that . . you should rest a bit longer . .","2178":"reaper let out a sigh . . try not to freak out . . but . . i was hit with a tree and the impact launched me through our ceiling . . the reason our room was the only place damaged is because i crashed into it . .","2179":"reaper winces since geno sort of moved his wings by accident though that definitely woke him up o ow ow . . ! t that hurt . . . . he then looks up at his tsun . . geno ?","2180":"hmn . . ? reaper was already half asleep when he heard geno and pokes his skull up slightly to look at his tsun","2181":"reaper then climbs in bed beside geno and lays himself face down into a pillow , his broken wings now in clear view , they looked busted like a broken kite and had feathers falling off them , he can t exactly hide that now when he s right beside geno . . .","2182":"but your so cute that way . . reaper chuckled a bit before laying his skull back down . . you mind if i rest with you . . ?","2183":"reaper starts getting a blue blush going across his skull heheh he s adorable that way","2184":". . i it was only for goth since he misbehaved . . you prefer epics idea with the giant paddle ? reaper now looks confused . . what s with the cookie . . ?","2185":"reaper lays his skull down by genos feet and grips at their bedsheets , oof . . it s f fine . . it s fine . . i just need a minute . .","2186":"reaper actually shrieks and drops the burger he was trying to feed to dontcallmesans and grips at his shoulder with his skull ducked down . . . agh ! w why did you do that ! ?","2187":". . uh . . we re not trying to kiii him . . you know that , right ? i d used this reaper then hands epic a broom what is he to you ? a mouse ? why the f ck","2188":"just don t let geno know about it , he s softer than we are reaper grins","2189":". . . let s not talk about that . . . drunk reaper is genos worst nightmare lol","2190":". . no you can t ! we re busy ! reaper ignores life and just goes back to focus on geno","2191":"reaper takes his scythe and reaps you with it the only one allowed to know is me !","2192":"my guess is badly . . life and death are exact opposites of eachother , it s not exactly easy for them to get along , you see that with me and life , don t you ?","2193":". . probably not . . but in case you wanna know . . goth had his robot pal go haywire . .","2194":"hey , dontcallmesans remember when i asked you out on our first date ?","2195":"this entire situation was goths fault this time . . he decided to mess with a robot and teach it to wreck it havoc . . reaper frowned","2196":"reaper immediately teleports after geno first , that is his top priority is his tsundere","2197":"did . . did she really just reaper is now p ssed","2198":". . wait wait . . what ! ? reaper hops up to his feet , that got him to wake back up that s a joke , right ?","2199":"i can handle it love . . i think . . just let life take care of you right now reaper gives a slight smile i did originally build this house anyway . .","2200":"i m gonna fix up our house while your resting , it s in pretty bad shape . . reaper looks up at their ceiling . . i m gonna send the other kiddos with you too","2201":". . reaper then stops sharing his magic and gets up with geno in his arms though the god visibly winces . . i i can take you over to lifes so you can rest , our bedroom is kinda . . in shambles right now . . . you can t exactly lay here . .","2202":"love ? ? reaper is still very worried and he starts sharing his magic with geno , he doesn t even know for sure if he needs it or not . .","2203":". . goth , for your moms sake i hope you behave yourself . . reaper frowned","2204":". . reaper just stares at him , he looks awfully worried already from this or . . .","2205":"that s one of gasters beasts though . . right ? you ll make sure that it doesn t eat goth and just scares him . . right ?","2206":"i can t say it right now but . . we ll have to talk to them when your better . .","2207":"no kidding . . though i can t pin all the blame on gothy . . i did teach them that scaring people and harming them were okay . . . . sorry love . .","2208":". . uh . . should i ask ?","2209":"reaper just nuzzles his tsun are you alright love ?","2210":"see anons ? he said he ll let goth out so no need for panic . .","2211":". . what did i just say ? how about we don t freak geno out ? reaper frowned","2212":". . that s really helpful . . you do know i m holding geno right now . . right ? i m trying to keep him from panicking and this is the opposite . . though . . our kiddos do have determination so . . gothy should be able to get out","2213":"well . . i m sure we can get him out of there later love , don t worry about it , if your gaster found a way out we can get goth out . .","2214":"h hey . . ! don t move ! reaper holds him when he tries to move let life heal you ! you were out cold a while ! and don t worry about goth okay ? it s just to scare him . . he won t stay there long enough to turn into a error or anything serious . .","2215":". . goth had his robot friend throw a tree . . reaper isn t telling him all of it . . i don t know what the heii he did to that robot but he caused a huge mess . . and when he gets out of the void i m kicking his . .","2216":". . it s nothing you should worry about right now . . focus on yourself . . though if geno were to look around the room he would see for himself , there was a hole in their roof right above their bed which looked like whatever crashed into the roof went through their bed too , there was also black feathers scattered all over the room . .","2217":". . can you take our kiddos too ? at least the others don t behave as badly . . it might be my fault for teaching them that behavior though . . reaper sighs","2218":". . he will be . . reaper just keeps geno hugged close . . life , can you take geno to your place . . when he s healed ? . . you need someplace safe to rest . .","2219":"reaper seemed to perk up a bit when he saw geno awake and actually speaking , his lone eye started to get glossy from tears filling up his sockets y you . . your okay . . ? heh . . you scared me to death . .","2220":". . . just focus on healing him . . please . .","2221":". . reaper refuses to speak to her and just stares down at geno in his arms . .","2222":"okay . . i m trusting you anons . . reaper gave a slight glare that message better be to ask for help and not something else . . the crow takes off to get thegoddessoflife","2223":"i really shouldn t be trusting a anon with this but . . my hands are tied right now . . can you put a note on the crow ? reaper whistles and eventually a crow does flock over into their room tell life we need help . .","2224":"what if he s severely hurt ? if i move him it could . . reapers bones actually start shaking from fright . . n no , not happening . . i can t i i ll ask her to come here . .","2225":"reaper unfortunately didn t see the crack before it were healed and he has no idea if

i i m scared to move you . . maybe . . get life ? . . we don t get along well but . . she is a healer . .","2226":"reaper just lays his skull on top of genos so much for coming home and everything

this . . all those times i scared people into giving us things . .","2227":"reaper is unbelievably worried and he actually pulls geno into his lap and holds him , hugging the tsun tightly please be okay . . you promised you d stay here with me . .","2228":"oh believe me . . he s getting punished for this ! reaper gets up and gets beside dontcallmesans but i i can t just leave geno like this . . he comes first , punishment will come later !","2229":"w what ! ? ! ? reaper dashes past goth and heads over to dontcallmesans","2230":"aw , are you saying my cute geno did that ? he s both cute and strong and i love him for it if you were flirting with him i d personally rip your arms off but uh . . thanks anon . . we don t get that a lot . . . kinda shocked . .","2231":"i hope your right . . reaper gives a faint smile when your better . . maybe i ll take you with me on the job . . just . . i ll be back soon love , you still have the kiddos here to help you when you need it he doesn t want to go but he knows he has to , if he doesn t he could get in trouble with the other gods he then teleports away","2232":"reaper then hugs his tsundere i will you better do the same love , i don t wanna come back home and find you were kidnapped or something happened while i was out . .","2233":"yeah . . i could get in serious trouble for skipping this much work . . that s a lot of souls i left just roaming around . . if i fail to reap the souls i m told to reap they kinda end up like ghosts and get stuck roaming around the timeline they re in . . and depending on the timeline that could be a bad thing . . but your right , it could of been way worse if gaster showed up","2234":"reaper was startled whe he heard geno chime in , i think he forgot he was literally sitting right beside him uh . . try not to freak out . . okay love ? it s just . . i ve quit reaping for a while now . . i ve always hated the job and i loved having a break away from it to spend time with you but . . i m not exactly allowed to do that . . i always end up erasing the other gods memories so i get away with skipping work but . . i don t know if i can get away with it this time . . it s not just , or even just gods that know about it , it s all of them this time . . i haven t tried wiping that many memories before . .","2235":"aw but you d look so cute","2236":"you think i can get geno to wear this now ?","2237":"i plan to but . . i have a few problems with my own timelines gods that i might have to deal with first . .","2238":"that s because it s true reaper blushed bright blue and just smirks i love when your mad just not when your mad at me","2239":". . is it me or was geno really hot when he did that ? seriously ? he just can t keep his mind out of the gutter on second thought . . don t answer that . . i would kiii you if you did . .","2240":"that s true . . and if he comes back we ll just kiii him again . . reaper then nuzzles geno you took that way better than i thought you would . . just . . now you know why i hate the guy so much . .","2241":"pfft reaper chuckled at that well , it s true . . that s why if we go out without changing . . i kinda have us stay far away from town . . . . honestly . . you got pretty scared of him back then . . with all the chaos he caused . . i erased your memory so you d go back to normal . . you just weren t you anymore . . not after he almost dusted me . . and while i was out of commission . . you told me he tried to force himself on you . . there s a lot of problems he s caused . .","2242":"reaper then clinks genos skull i love you . . and . . while i m getting stuff off my chest . . i think i should probably tell you the stuff i erased from your memory about ganz . . . . his gaze turned serious as he stopped hugging the tsun . . the reason i have us change clothes whenever we go to the surface isn t because i care about how we look , you look perfect to me the way you are and if anyone tried to say otherwise they d have to deal with me . . a anyway . . kinda got off track . . . . the thing is . . he ran around dressed in a cloak similar to mine and caused a bunch of chaos on the surface . . now everyone is looking for a skeleton with a scythe and robe . . i ve had humans attack me and try to arrest me whenever i went out with you . . he nervously rubs his arm . .","2243":"reaper gave a nod y yeah . . i . . i really thought . . you d leave me or . . be afraid of me from that . . but you aren t . . he then lays his skull on top of genos","2244":"reaper just nuzzles geno i thought you would of taken that a lot worse than i did . . i thought you would leave me . . he starts tearing up h heh . . thanks love . . maybe we should do the whole talking thing more . .","2245":"g geno . . reaper hugs him back tightly i used to think everyone just feared her because of their title of being . . you know . . death . . just like with me . . but it wasn t the case . . . . those souls weren t from animals . . they were monsters like us and . . i ve . . eaten them . . i believed her . . and ate several of those ghost apples . . that honestly let s you know how gullible reaper can be","2246":"you say that but . . i m . . i m honestly afraid about this one . . reaper nervously fumbles with the strings on his robes geno . . the fight that happened yesterday . . with lady death . . the souls she puts inside those apples . . she originally told me . . they were just souls of animals that passed away , not animals like jasper . . i mean like the crows i have summoned to me . . that s why i didn t think what she was doing was a big deal . . but a lot of people were against her . . and i saw how you reacted when she said she would eat your soul . . i didn t take her seriously . . and tried to comfort you . . i didn t know she . . really wasn t kidding . . that she really would of ate you . . until that whole battle yesterday . . . . i saw she lied to me . .","2247":"i . . reaper then sits himself down on the bed beside geno . . t this . . this isn t something easy to talk about . . i i just . . i . . i need you to promise . . you won t leave me . . when you hear what i say .

says chuckling slightly as he grabbed a handful of plushies from their closet","2250":"only way he would spill it is if geno pulled a guilt card on him , like if the tsun told him something like you don t trust me enough to tell me that would have reaper spilling the beans in minutes but for now the god is seen getting up and heading over to their closet","2251":"reaper nervously laughs w what ? i can t spoil you once in a while ? just relax , okay ? i know you said your fine but . . on the off chance your not , your staying put , you won t have to cook for a while if i scared grillby into giving us bags of food right ?","2252":"reaper just sighs and buries his skull into his hands , letting out a groan . . ughhh ! damn it , this is frustrating . . . . pull yourself together . . geno needs you . . he doesn t realize he had spoken outloud and turns to look at geno again so uh . . how s the grillbys ? i brought some for a few days . . ehm . .","2253":"reaper looks back to geno with absolute fear in his lone eye , you could swear he actually seemed terrified about something . . . . he hesitates and ends up staring at geno for a few minutes before sitting himself back on the floor y your cheeseburgers might be cold by now . . you should eat them . . . . i ll be fine babe . . your worrying about the wrong one here . .","2254":"geno . . reaper just shakes his skull i its nothing , really . . though he s spent most the day skulking on the floor . .","2255":"n nothing . . ! nothing love reaper has been pretty off though , after handing geno the grillbys he sits on the floor beside their bed and fumbles with the strings dangling off his robe . . i . . i mean . . it s really nothing . .","2256":"shh ! ! he could hear you ! reaper frowned a bit as he folded his arms a and . . i don t normally eat them either . . i used to whenever lady death would visit but . . i didn t know what they really were either . . just . . don t tell geno . . he would look at me the same way everyone sees horror . . .","2257":"hmn . . . nah reaper chuckled nervously , he s trying to act normal but failing at it he sets all the bags down except for one which he hands to geno just kidding love , unless you want me to","2258":"ouch . . reaper didn t mean to hurt geno but he s afraid of telling him after seeing his reaction to the ghost apples knowing it was made out of souls , especially now that he knows they were monster souls and not animal ones , it s really bothering him and the fact he fell apart in battle and had to have geno save him though the god of death comes back after about a hour with more than just one bag of grillbys , he came back with about . . hey , geno ? you awake . . ?","2259":". . reaper just stares down at the ground as his demeanor changed , you don t know why but it seemed like he was suddenly giving geno the cold shoulder , he didn t even respond to what geno were talking about and just walked off . . i i m gonna go get you some grillbys . . be back in a few minutes . . it s the least i can do after that . .","2260":"h huh ? reaper looked a bit startled by that question your asking the wrong one that . . you just used blaster beasts . . remember ?","2261":"weeell , if i was gonna reintroduce myself on a date with geno","2262":"reaper then steps in front of her hey there kiddo , aren t you raven and gothys friend ?","2263":"how about you stay in bed for a while ? as much as i d like to laze around with you , i know one of us has to be up and about . . plus . . i . . i feel bad i dragged you into that fight . . i should of fought on my own . . that goddess could of really hurt you . . reaper then looks away from geno with his arms folded . . .","2264":"are you okay after that ? reaper gives him a worried look i know what using those blaster beasts can do to you . . he knows fully well geno suffers backlash from using his blaster beasts at times , that s why he always nags at him not to use his powers","2265":"reaper blushed bright blue at that and just happily lays again his tsun heh , your right as usual though . . you did most the work this time . . i barely held myself together . .","2266":"t thanks love . . reaper grips at his robe as he desperately tries to catch his breath , if geno weren t there this could have ended pretty badly","2267":"the god actually falls down in his knees and seemed entirely out of breath , he drops his scythe and started panting heavily . . i i need a minute . .","2268":"reaper then points at thegoddess fdeath who is currently swinging her scythe at him . . g geno . . i hate to say it . . and i really don t wanna involve you . . but . . i did just recover from almost dusting . . i . . i can t handle this . . the god clenches his eyes shut as he started trembling . . it s too much on me . .","2269":"a actually . . reaper looks at geno with a pleading look in his eye love ? are you up for fighting . . ?","2270":"thanks nova . . reaper let s out a sigh of relief","2271":"oh . . uh . . i honestly didn t know that . . reaper sweats a bit i thought they were made out of that glue stuff i see marked on bottles . . what exactly does he think glue is ?","2272":". . . i m not gonna ask . . . i feel like i shouldn t know why . .","2273":"they aren t ? reaper just blinks as he stared at geno","2274":"glue ! mod facepalms again","2275":"n no ! ! your made of skeletons ! ? omg geno ! ! there are skeletons inside people ! !","2276":"o or . . maybe you don t need healed ? . . wait . . you have a skeleton inside of you ! ? mod facepalms","2277":". . what ! ? reaper just stares at berry like da faq","2278":"love ? can you call dream or life ? reaper shouts back i m fine but nova got into a fight with lady death , she s in pretty rough shape , i m gonna head off and see what s going on for myself","2279":"j just . . stay here with geno . . maybe he can get life or dream to come heal ya . . i need to see someone . . reaper let s out a sigh . .","2280":"what the heii are you doing ! ? reaper steps in and blocks berrys scythe with his own that s another god ! do you know how much trouble our timelines will be in if you do that ! ?","2281":"w wait wait . . what ! ? what . . what universe am i in ? is this some kind of multiversal prank ? i i mean how did you even know about and her going crazy i i might need a minute to process this . .","2282":"reaper honestly looks shocked like unbelievably when he hears the situation , i don t think he ever thought lady death was capable of that","2283":"reaper hurries over to her and hands her a life flower you look more like death than i do . . what s going on ?","2284":"uh . . i m gonna guess you don t get it either ? yeah let s go with that , geno knows reaper all too well , that info would definitely break him if he knew they were in a videogame","2285":"w what the heii happened to you . . ! ? reaper stares at nova in complete shock before getting up out of bed","2286":"uuuhh . . geno ? can you explain ? reaper looks to dontcallmesans","2287":"not yet reaper chuckled a bit what can i say ? your adorable love","2288":". . okay , you lost me . . reaper isn t that self aware that they re videogame characters and that their aus can get rebooted","2289":"i was drooling ? i didn t even notice . . but can you blame me ? reaper just grins","2290":". . reaper actually snorts when he gets elbowed and starts waking up . . mnh . . ? but i was having a good dream with you in a bikini seriously","2291":"no kidding reaper then dozed off after teasing geno , for once things are actually peaceful for them the next day , when geno wakes up , he finds himself in a literal death hug with the god drooling on him","2292":"thanks love . . wait . . that s possible for you ? reaper chuckled a bit i thought you were a worry wart","2293":"l looovveee . . . ! i i can hear you ! the gods face turns deep blue as he buried his skull into genos shoulder","2294":". . kind of . . reaper blushed a bit , he looked pretty embarrassed just from having to lean on geno to walk not exactly used to not floating . . .","2295":". . your timeline doesn t sound like anything i thought it was . . that s actually f cked up . . .","2296":"uhhh . . . on second thought . . forget i said that . . reaper now looks more serious than joking , that did cause him to worry instead . . uh . . maybe we should just head to bed ?","2297":". . or i could have a very cute skeleton carry me reaper chuckled a bit , he was only joking , he honestly gets embarrassed as heii whenever geno does carry him","2298":"wait what ? reaper just stares at him gaster ? ? does he experiment on you . . ? actually that has happened","2299":"reaper is actually wobbling and ends up having to hold onto geno does he literally never walk ? ? talk about embarrassing . . d don t mention this to anyone . .","2300":"know what ? reaper looks confused","2301":". . pfft ! that got reaper to laugh you could say that but don t i fall for you everyday ?","2302":"love , calm down , i wouldn t allow her to do anything like that . . she would have to go through me first before she ever laid a hand on you or the kiddos . .","2303":"thanks love reaper gets to his feet and actually , since he really isn t used to walking he ends up falling right into his tsundere oof !","2304":"lol reaper just gives him a look uh . . maybe don t , she can turn your soul into a apple and eat it . .","2305":"thanks love , can you help get this stuff off me ? sorry just . . reaper points to the fallen down stand and monitor laying on top of him i can t exactly get up . .","2306":"love , i promise you , i d never let anything like that happen to you , plus she can t touch you , i trapped you in limbo , remember ?","2307":". . i didn t know that . . so it was kinda like reapertale . . ? but instead of gods they had trees . . reaper coughs a bit since the equipment he still had hooked to him kinda fell on him now i m tired . .","2308":". . he isn t ? reaper now looks shocked","2309":"love . . reaper smiled nervously y you know that would never happen . . right ?","2310":". . love . . ? reaper stares up at geno h hey , geno ? you okay ?","2311":"oh . . that s good reaper sighed in relief wait . . tree of magic ? ?","2312":"reaper then waves up at geno love . . ? can . . i get a hand . . ?","2313":"reaper just looks confused uh . . is this a ghost apple ? nonono","2314":"mmph ! ? reaper gets knocked off the iv stand from having the apple shoved in his face and falls back through the portal landing at dontcallmesans feet xd well that s one way to help , at least he took a bite out of the apple from that oomph ! !","2315":"reaper jumps from shock and clings onto his iv stand , he kinda forgot to unhook all his equipment which doesn t help ah ! ! what ! ?","2316":"oof reaper was just stepping through the portal when geno ran in , honestly should he really be doing this already ? geno . . ! ?","2317":"okay , looks like i m off . . maybe keep this between us ? i think geno would freak if he knew i m heading off somewhere i ll be back soon kiddo reaper then heads through the portal to her world to look for her friends","2318":"if you say so . . reaper then gets up and summons his scythe , creating a portal to what is hopefully jaspers world so the friends i m gonna look for is a snake and wolf ?","2319":"uuuhhh . . . i m not even gonna ask . .","2320":"what idea ? reaper blinks as he stares at epic","2321":"thanks dream reaper actually gave him a smile i ll try to take it easy . . you should get back before cross panics geno might still be majorly worried though","2322":"geez kiddo . . this might not be a good idea . . i mean . . we aren t even in your multiverse . . what s gonna stop them from seeing you as lunch here ?","2323":"but does it count when your off the job ?","2324":". . that doesn t exactly sound great . . they don t eat rabbits like you ?","2325":"reaper picks up the toy up off his skull and smacks himself with it lol kinda hard to fear him when you see him like that xd pfft ! geno ! look , it really does make a weird sound and it s floppy ! why is it floppy ! ? he starts smacking both himself and epic with the toy","2326":"a wolf and a snake ? i m surprised you made it to work without being eaten . .","2327":"reaper then yanks off epics hood just so he can see the chicken toy xd","2328":". . i could always send them to the underworld","2329":"i gotta ask . . you always say bruh . . what s it mean ? is it like the stuff fresh says ?","2330":"ooh . . okay wait geno ! ? reaper then pulls his tsun into a hug where were you ! ?","2331":"well i ll take that as a compliment , grim reaper isn t supposed to be not scary , so uh . . you still want me to find your snake pal when i m better ?","2332":"reaper just looks confused is it a cat ?","2333":"fake chicken . . ? like . . what . . is it really a rabbit or something ?","2334":"what ? ? right reaper is from ancient times , he has no idea what a rubber chicken is , he thinks it s a literal chicken made of rubber chickens in your au are made of rubber ? ?","2335":"reaper is now distracted repeatedly bonking poor epic in the skull with his scythe xd","2336":"pfft how are you doing that ? ? reaper actually starts laughing y your head heheh !","2337":"reaper just stares at him and bonks him again cause his head squeaked lol","2338":"he . . does ? ? i honestly didn t know that . . well it beats having to deal with him . . no offense . . we just don t get along . .","2339":"no ! ! reaper actually grabs his scythe and bonks epic on the skull with the blunt end i would rather deal with nightmare than any gaster !","2340":"to heii with that idea ! it would probably work but then i d have to deal with cross ! cross is his husband you know","2341":"with just me and my brother it took us years to bring her back . . our magic wasn t strong enough . . but there s not just people here now and as much as i hate to admit it . . a lot of you do outrank me on power . . reaper frowned . . nova did heal it some , it s not cracked or almost shattering anymore but to fully heal it you can t do it all alone . . i couldn t do it alone . . if paps didn t help me life wouldn t be here at all","2342":"reaper sighs . . i think i might of scared him . . i ll try to explain the situation as best as i can . . the reason i m hooked up to all this stuff is because my soul took some serious damage from me constantly using my forbidden powers . . it took enough damage from my powers now it doesn t want to accept my magic anymore . . which is a pretty big problem . . epics machines here are forcing it to take magic whether it wants to or not . . and nova completely healed all of my injuries but to heal a gods soul is pretty difficult . . last time it took both her and life to fix it . . when a gods soul takes damage its not easy to fix it , it took me and my brother forever to bring life back when chara kiiied her","2343":". . reaper then rubs his eye sockets is he with you ?","2344":"mnh . . ? reaper didn t even notice geno had left and went to go get dream , the god thought he was still beside him until he heard dream speak . . dream . . ? what . . did i fall asleep ? . . geno . . got you ?","2345":"i its fine , really . . just don t tell anyone that you saw the grim reaper get carried around . . reaper looked away , he was still a little embarrassed","2346":"m maybe i should be quiet now . . reaper then closes his eye sockets and just nuzzles into geno , i don t think that s a good idea either he might think your dead stahp scaring the smol !","2347":"reaper then pulls geno into a hug c calm down love , i m not trying to scare you but . . you have to admit it s taken a long time , it s like waiting for death itself he winks maybe not a good time to make death jokes","2348":"reaper sweats a bit h hey , i m fine right now , i m not on my death bed anymore just . . things could always go from good to bad in a moments notice , just saying be prepared if that does happen that isn t helping","2349":"but imagine a scientist like epic in real life all dressed up with a lab coat and glasses carrying a clipboard and starts talking like brrruuuuuuuhhhh ima firin mah lazer at teh moon cows are turkeys i love mah jab then they pull out a rubber chicken from their coat and start slapping people with it pfft reaper actually laughs from that it s funny cause i know you would , i don t plan on dusting love but . . i don t think i can hide how bad it is when i look like this . . reaper holds up his arm and you see a couple blue and red wires taped to it , they were running up his arm into his soul . . you know how dangerous it is for me to use my full power right . . ? and . . i ve been using it a lot when i really shouldn t have . . that s how i ended up like this in the first place , my soul couldn t handle using all that power back to back . . i m finally recovering now but . . i don t know if i ll make it through recovery . . it s been pretty rough . . it s taken literal months for it to start getting better . . geno is going to freak","2350":"aw that caused the god to blush bright blue , he didn t expect geno to clink his forehead and stares up at him in surprise u uuuh . . . i i mean that s true . . ! kinda surprised you haven t got tired of death though","2351":"epic is a royal scientist in his au so that s probably how but i don t know why they would allow a meme lord like epic as royal scientist reaper just lays his skull down against genos shoulder heh . . not that i have much of a choice , i already tried running off with this stuff and ended up put back here . . though . . i could happily dust now knowing your okay . .","2352":"i m fine love , just . . really happy your okay though that s not true , unfortunately the god seemed to need more help than geno did , he had a lot of hospital equipment hooked to him , even a monitor was brought in to keep track of his soul , he looked as bad as cq geno and i didn t even think that were possible , he even had a line stuck into his nose hole for oxygen geno might freak the f ck out in about a few seconds","2353":"reaper had forced himself to stay up all night or well he s trying to , he s been almost nodding off every few minutes until he hears his tsundere wake up geno . . ! ? y you okay ! ?","2354":"your asking me of all people for relationship advice ? i i don t even know how ours survived . .","2355":"epic ended up picking him up and carrying him lol which made reaper start blushing out of embarrassment d don t tell this to anyone ! but t thanks for trying to help kiddo . .","2356":"reaper just stares at epic . . i m gonna say i dusted and i m in some sort of purgatory . . having you of all people help us . . isn t cross your best friend ? i thought you d wanna dust us . .","2357":"reaper looks really embarrassed to be carried and starts blushing bright blue . . t tell this to no one . . b but . . thanks . .","2358":"reaper is trying to rush off to genos side but he caused a bit of a mess and ended up crashing into epic , dragging him down with him , running off with several pieces of hospital equipment hooked to you , not a good idea","2359":"though he probably shouldn t be up when he has a monitor , ivs and who knows what else hooked up , he actually falls over himself and crashes right on top of epic with the iv toppling down on them , trying to run off with that equipment , not a very big brain idea","2360":"kiddo , help me up ! reaper then holds a hand out to her though not sure how she ll be able to help him , she is pretty small","2361":"reaper then summons his scythe to pull himself out of bed geno ! ! i have to see him ! !","2362":". . is . . he okay ?","2363":". . can i dust now ? geno would probably slap the heii out of you for saying that","2364":"h hey ! ! i am not shor reaper was in the middle of yelling when he finds he s actually tall now or rather genos height ort . . ? . . am . . am i in a fever dream ?","2365":"reaper now looks dumbfounded i m confused . . has a anyone seen geno ?","2366":"what reaper now turned bright blue lol h how long was i out ?","2367":"uhhh . . . reaper just stares at both jasper and epictalesans looking completely confused . . . i . . i don t . . remember anything . . when did epic get here . . ?","2368":"reaper just stares at her confused . . . . whhyyy . . ? ?","2369":"reaper actually starts snapping out of it and starts returning to normal after epictalesans started helping his soul . . where am i . . ? why is there something in my eye ? and . . w when did you get here . . ?","2370":"reaper actually shoves the donut in his eye socket did . . did he seriously forget what donuts are ? his favorite food and he forgot what it is ? did i do it ?","2371":"you who ? yeeaaah he isn t himself","2372":"who s mr ? mod facepalms","2373":"huh ? genos the one that needs help . . i m fine . . wait . . no . . my names death not fine . . uh . .","2374":"you sound familiar . . hey love . . ! dontcallmesans do we know any bunnies ?","2375":"huh ? your not paps ? reaper rubs his eye sockets before looking at her again . . paps is my brother . . but you don t look like him . . your a lot smaller . .","2376":". . you can come in paps just don t wake gothy and geno . . they sleep what ?","2377":"when raven checks him over he also discovered bl d under his dads robe , it would be easy to confuse that to be genos except it didn t spread to his side of the bed","2378":"oof , try not to scream like that , geno is literally laying beside him","2379":"but when raven rolled him over , he saw a bl d spot on his father s pillow and it was also on his mouth , he didn t appear to just be sleeping","2380":"though the god of death is completely unresponsive , he doesn t budge at all","2381":"aw though reaper doesn t seem to be awake yet , he doesn t respond","2382":"omg wait why did epic show up in their bedroo on second thought i probably don t wanna know though it is scary reaper didn t respond that , he always has his mind in the gutter when it comes to geno","2383":"oof the death god wasn t awake yet but he would definitely be panicking if he was , when geno opened his eyes , he saw reapers hand laying on top of his own as the god laid facedown with his skull buried into a pillow","2384":". . reaper then yells for dontcallmesans which he really didn t want to do but he s going to dust if he continues to lay there . . g geno . . ! the death god cries out as he lays on the ground","2385":"i hate to ask . . but . . can someone help me up . . ? i also . . n need to get this iv outta my soul . . before i end up . . needing another life flower . . reaper winces as he rolls himself on his side , there was still bl d seen dripping from his mouth . . i can t do this on m my own . . e even though . . i m r really trying to . .","2386":"the flower glows and turns into little white sparkles that start to fade away and the god of death starts to wake back up not too long after t thanks kiddo . . that helped . .","2387":"reaper shakes his skull , when goth shoved him , he caused the needle of the iv to shove through his soul and there was visible bl d pouring from his mouth . . we . . we have . . healing s stuff . . ask geno . . to . . he points at dontcallmesans before fainting on the ground","2388":". . goth ! although yelling like that threw him into a coughing fit , he s definitely going to go check on his tsundere now","2389":"d did something happen . . ! ? now reaper is in panic mode i i thought he was asleep what happened . . ! ?","2390":"reaper shakes his skull i don t think i ll understand that . . you like someone who sees you as food . . but if you really want him here , i suppose i could do that , you did bring us donuts when you didn t have to . . you could of easily backed away from visiting death himself . .","2391":"pfft reaper actually laughs you sound like geno , but last i checked my name was death , not green . . ow . . he then hunches over and holds his skull . . s skullache . .","2392":"i m fine , one of us has to be up and about . . it leaves us open if we re both laying down . . although reaper is starting to get a green blush reappearing on his skull . . just need to be careful of my magic use . .","2393":". . uuhh reaper started blushing since he immediately went to thinking about geno is it me or is it impossible for him to keep his mind out of the gutter ?","2394":"wait wait wait . . . he s tried to eat you and you wanna bring him here ?","2395":"a snake ? that s . . no offense but your a bunny and he s a snake , i m surprised you get along","2396":"heh , so you admit your world isn t as great as you said huh ? but . . who s jax kiddo ?","2397":"reaper looks shocked at that question . . i don t think i have any nicknames . . well , i go by reaper or death but . . if your the grim reaper , do those count as nicknames ?","2398":"do you wanna go back to your world or do you wanna stay in our multiverse ? i could probably take you back to your world , i have a scythe i can male portals with","2399":"i can handle it if anything happens , you should stay put reaper then grabs onto his scythe and uses it as a makeshift crutch to pull himself up out of bed which really doesn t help genos nerves","2400":"your in worse shape than i am love , my wounds will heal , yours won t . . you should stay in bed reaper then clinks his skull","2401":". . well , i think one of us should be up in case they don t . . and there s no way in heii i m letting you out of bed right now . . reaper then reaches over the side of their bed and grabs his scythe up off the floor as long as i don t use any magic i should be fine . .","2402":"so your kinda stuck here aren t you ?","2403":"well if he touched her she be dead xd she has a reason to worry thanks kiddo . . though as much as i d like to try it , i think i know someone who could use it more than i do he then hands the slice of cake to dontcallmesans","2404":"kinda . . we did just have anons attack us . . reaper sighs . .","2405":"no it s not reaper frowned just . . don t know what to do now since neither of us are really up for moving around . . he tries to think . . .","2406":"reaper shakes his skull i its nothing . . just . . you were worried about me the whole time when your not okay . . you stay put , you hear me ?","2407":"love ? ? reaper then sits himself up and takes off his half of their blanket and wraps it around geno w what happened . . ! ? did you get sick ? ?","2408":"shesocute uh . . not really used to anyone thanking death of all people but . . your welcome ? and i still think there should be someone that should stick up for you guys . . even in my timeline i was the only one who stood up to chara and saw the kiddo for what she really was . . . . did you say carrot cake ? what s a cake ? right he s from ancient time wait he s had donuts but never had a cake ! ?","2409":"but she s also half harbinger , maybe she could make out some words but maybe not enough to fully understand her , like papyrus when he tries to figure out windings and considering sans can understand moldsmal that literally just wiggles around and doesn t speak , i think monsters could understand jasper","2410":"i think you guys should do something to level the playing field , it shouldn t be that way reaper frowned . . and you can eat here , you did bring us donuts . . plus you don t seem like a bad kiddo","2411":"that doesn t sound exactly peaceful like you said . . they eat you and attack you just because they can t understand you ? reaper frowned yet you guys haven t done anything to them . . i don t know about you but a animal that can talk shouldn t be considered food","2412":"reaper pauses when he hears that i don t think i d agree with you on that kiddo . .","2413":"when geno returns reaper was seen still laying in the same spot he were left in but only with shino sitting on the end of the bed , he hasn t moved at all","2414":"shino is a very inoccent smol reaper doesn t move from the spot he were laying in , no matter how much shino talked to him , she couldn t get a response out of him","2415":"reaper doesn t even seem to notice shino was there , he was completely out cold , though he might scare their poor daughter without meaning to , he had a green blush going across his skull and his breath sounded raspy and wheezy , he really needs to quit using his magic and let his soul recover . .","2416":"reaper doesn t even seem to notice he was put back in bed , honestly he may have passed out right then and there on poor geno , if only he knew how much he was really scaring him","2417":". . reaper chuckled a bit since that is true , he has handcuffed geno , tied him up and even went as far as putting a magic suppressor on him to make sure he was resting when he needed it . . . b but . . your in a different boat . . love . . you only have a ninth of . . a soul . . i m still in better shape . . than you are . . a actually . . right now . . it should be rever . . he trails off as he was starting to black out a bit . .","2418":"reaper just rests in genos arms with his eyes closed , he seemed exhausted . . . we . . can still . . go out . . if . . huff we had way . . for me to travel . . w without walking . . wheeze so . . tired . .","2419":"reaper then flops against genos leg when his tsun walked up beside him . . i . . i don t think . . i can . . do it . . . . .","2420":". . g geno . . reaper just waves a arm motioning for geno to come over to him , is he okay ?","2421":". . you k kidding . . me . . ? reaper then slides down on his knees with a arm wrapped around the iv stand as he takes a moment to catch his breath . . so . . tired . .","2422":"reaper is having quite a bit of trouble , he s holding onto his iv stand so he doesn t fall and tries taking baby steps to walk , it was honestly painful to watch since it took him literally minutes to hobble from their bed to their doorway , by the end of it , the god was gasping and clinging to the iv stand . . . . d did . . i get . . to the . . . kitchen . . ?","2423":"goth is busy tormenting a robot anyway xd","2424":"reaper had started breathing heavily and gripped at his chest once he was helped up . . i i think . . let me . . t try . . . .","2425":"thanks love . . reaper is trying his best to calm himself , at least enough that he isn t having a literal death grip on geno . . you think you can help me up . . ?","2426":"or . . we could text them . . i . . i really need you here right now reaper then clings onto geno , he still seemed pretty shaken up i know it s selfish of me but . . i really need you right now . . please stay . .","2427":"after what

both strong and doesn t age , we call it death metal , pun intended reaper chuckled","2462":"their gloves are made of plastic , plastic is something that can age and fall apart . .","2463":"besides anyone that s immortal ? not really . . how my death touch works is it causes things to age rapidly and fall apart . . that s why it doesn t affect clothing , it s not something that can age . . it can t affect the gods here or geno since they don t age . .","2464":". . i m literal death of course i wouldn t look okay reaper chuckled a bit jokes aside . . not only would that give geno a panic attack . . but my death touch nearly kills everyone there . . it s just a bad idea . .","2465":". . huh . . ? reaper then looks to see he does in fact have ivs in his soul now . . heh . . you really did catch me . . not in the way i hoped though . . but . . you shouldn t push yourself either love . . you can t exactly deal with stress very well . . he gives a faint smile the only thing you should

problems like this let alone need ivs . . hhnnnh . . ?","2467":". . y yeah . . but . . c can you . . catch me . . ? reaper then collapses , dropping his scythe from his hands","2468":". . reaper was honestly shocked , he didn t expect to see ganz show up and immediately summons his scythe i think i know why geno was acting that way now . . he stumbles quite a bit but forces himself up out of bed with his scythe acting as his crutch i m going to send you personally to heii . . .","2469":". . reaper was just starting to wake up when he hears this , he was seen rubbing his eye sockets . . ketchup . . ? i know that s one of genos favorites but . . personally , i ve never had it so . . can t really tell you . . my favorite thing is coffee , the ones from starbucks are so good . . with donuts . . you actually see him drool with the goofiest grin on his face what i would give for a donut right now . .","2470":"i will if you do . . reaper then starts falling asleep on geno","2471":"your always worried reaper chuckled a bit but . . it is normal to worry about someone you love . . i worry about you everyday he opens his eye a tad so he can give geno a smile maybe that s why your always tired , you do run through my mind all day","2472":"that s good . . but i say . . we ground him from seeing palette period . . that ll teach him not to do pranks like this . . and . . if . . i m being honest here . . . . i . . i really don t know love . . it s never been this bad before . . reaper then grips at his chest if i stop using my powers for a while . . it might it should be fine . . how are you holding up though ?","2473":"reaper closes his eyes true . . he shouldn t be pranking you anyway with your soul as is . . the first thing i m doing is grounding him for a month . . when i can move again . .","2474":". . heh . . i know h he s a prankster but . . he really needs to learn that some of his pranks aren t exactly safe . . at least all he did t this time was spray people with water . . the last prank he did blew me away . . literally . .","2475":"reaper then scoots over a bit so he s right beside geno , laying against his tsun you look dead tired .

unresponsive","2483":"reaper doesn t respond , he just stays laying on the bed with his eyes closed , did he not hear geno or . . ?","2484":"surprisingly reaper didn t react at all when he was slid off geno , he just stayed laying on the bed with his eyes closed , without any remarks . .","2485":". . too tired . . reaper just stays laying on genos lap , he didn t even bother to open his eyesockets when he replied back to geno . .","2486":"reaper was a bit out of sorts and didn t notice goth , alastor or the new robotic friend he had when he got sprayed with water which caused him to go into a coughing fit on dontcallmesans that s not good","2487":"aw you can tell how much they love eachother cx reaper seemed to be fine but after a little while , he seemed to wince in his sleep and began pulling at his robe . . ngh . .","2488":". . okay . . reaper yawns again before falling back asleep on geno with his hand gripping at his chest , his soul might be hurting but it is completely healed now","2489":"lol reaper then starts lightly tugging at genos hoodie , he was almost back to sleep from his tsun petting his skull . . lauve . . ? . . what z . . yawn . . goin . . on

him","2492":". . just checking to see if your still there . . reaper chuckled a bit sorry i didn t tell you about . . my problem earlier . . he motions to his soul . . using my full power just once is enough to almost dust me . . but using it back to back like that . . i m really surprised i survived it . . if you weren t here , i wouldn t of . . i hope you know your the reason i m not actual death right now he let out another chuckle if it wasn t for you and nova . . i d be sitting here as a pile of dust right now . .","2493":". . not exactly used to anyone wanting to be friends with literal

both went through the same type of stuff . . her story and mine have some similar stuff that s happened . . major difference is , my story was done by a psychotic kiddo and a power hungry god of magic while hers was by experiment happy scientists . .","2494":"aw it was a couple hours later before the death god did finally wake up and he rubs his eye sockets mnh . . geno . . ?","2495":"oof xd poor

his arms around one of genos legs and nuzzles his skull into him","2519":"mngh . . reaper started gripping at his robe while he were asleep , maybe he should of just came out and said he needed one but he didn t want geno panicking","2520":"when geno looks at the phone he sees reaper was actually trying to send a text to goth and even though the text is a misspelled mess you can still make out the words , it says gothv kan u g t q ivy fur me he might of been trying to go back and fix his spelling errors so goth would understand him more clearly but couldn t do it","2521":"dontcallmesans

geno forget about the entire incident with goth","2541":"i ll try to make sure we don t continue fighting in your home . . sorry about that and sorry about your lamp by the way , gothy kinda broke it

?","2543":"reaper just blinks in surprise at nova , honestly he didn t expect any of this . . i don t think i ve heard you call this your kingdom before . . but thanks for helping with gothy . . i

him , he duscovers the death god laying against a tree with what looked like horrific bruises , he had what appears to be a black eye in the middle of it all and had a spot of bl d on his mouth , which is all really just more marker he drew all over himself but it looked believable","2553":"probably to genos dismay , the death god is no longer laying with him , he wasn t anywhere inside the pagoda either but you can spot his scythe was laying outside near a tree not too far from the pagoda","2554":"when geno does wake up later , reaper is going to terrify the poor guy","2555":"reaper

explains why you don t fear me like most . . and why my death touch doesn t . . reaper then dozes off in the middle of his sentence which is pretty surprising auto correct put dies off lol he just freaking dies while faking to be more hurt than he really is just to teach goth a lesson xd talk about irony , that level of irony is too much","2560":"reaper actually fell asleep on nova which honestly , he hasn t let himself fall asleep like that around anyone except geno , grillby and asgore who are all considered to be his closest friends , he must consider nova to be a good friend of

unbelievably shocked with his lone blue eye light filling his whole socket , the last thing he expected was a hug especially from nova who doesn t exactly seem like the hugging type though the warmth

stone not metal like the others with flashing lights and all . . . but alphys is the goddess of knowledge , she probably knows about the technology in other timelines . . i could ask her if she knows about cellphones . .","2568":"that was before me and life became enemies though . . she never forgave me for what happened to chara . . i was hoping we could of at least stayed friends . . as you know i don t have very many . . reaper sighed a anyway , i can see about trying to teach asgore about cellphones . . doubt he ll understand it though . . me and painless messed around with them for a while before we got the hang of it","2569":"pretty much . . reaper looks a bit embarrassed now i didn t even know the names of the stuff i d taken . . i called cellphones a magic box you can use to talk to eachother . . i didn t know what stores were either , here we call them agora and it s not the same type of store geno is thinking of , our stores don t use coins , you just take what you need and be on your way . . his timeline is very ancient","2570":"i tried that with life but she couldn t figure out how to use it . . reaper frowned even though i personally tried to show her how . . i don t know if asgore will be able to learn how either . . our timeline isn t like the others , we send hand written letters to eachother using birds . . i learned about cellphones from stealing the one i have off a body i reaped . .","2571":"we ll keep talking later , i need to go get gothy and see life before i forget again . . reaper then holds his soul you would think with all the peace and quiet

about funny but you definitely don t sound like the same nova , the one we know now wouldn t hide or cower in fear of anyone , heii , you took me on and nightmare himself without batting a eye ! i can understand why you would be afraid of humans though after what you ve gone through but . . that doesn t sound like the nova i met here . . i wonder though . . if opal can communicate with the dead just like i can . . is she entirely human ?","2575":"i didn t know that either . . so opal talks to ghosts ? like divination ? or exorcist ? riigght reapers from ancient times , he doesn t know about mediums why was nova hiding in a attic . . ?","2576":"well . . not exactly . . it s someone who did experiments on nova . . geno going to freak out in minutes though from what i heard he was forced to do it against his will , the scientists there can kiii him if he refuses to do what they say","2577":"so . . wait . . you were one of those humans but . . you didn t know what they were doing . . and they turned on you . . am i understanding this right ? i know i have trouble understanding these things since . . how do i explain ? the world i m from has beds made of stone and we use water clocks to tell time , if that tells you anything . . . project evolution ?","2578":"oh . . reaper rubs his skull , looking a bit embarrassed anime doesn t even exist in reapertale . . i only learned it from you when you got gothy that mew mew book and that moving picture thing for his birthday , you call them dvds and shows , you also were the one that taught me how to use the tv i had and told me the stuff on there were called shows and movies . . . . and . . if that s what a complex is , maybe we should move into one he chuckled a bit","2579":"reaper is just kinda standing there lost in his own thoughts lol he does finally speak outloud after a bit uh . . . love ? can you explain what cybernetics are and what a complex is ?","2580":"so those humans pretty much control your every move , all the more reason why a place like that should be taken down , where i m from they don t exactly have scientists at least not the same kind and i thinks it s about time yours got their karma . . wait you said they gave you your powers ?","2581":"cyber wha ? ? now you lost me . . all i understood was the comatose part . . geno would probably be facepalming if he could hear their conversation","2582":"that s true . . but they also haven t had to deal with the grim reaper face to face . . reaper just smiles i ll be okay love , don t forget i m called the god of death for a reason","2583":". . but you called him a subject just like what those humans called you . . it sounds like he might of been forced to do things just like you were . . i don t see why else he would help you escape . . .","2584":"love , i know your worried but i don t think any normal human could stop me , even if it s a whole army , i m literal death , one touch and they all would die plus they re outside the multiverse , it s not like they can rally up more humans and come here though if they have guns , sentries , turrets , etc all modern tech reaper has never had to fight against . . it could go south , reaper is from ancient times where organizations like that never existed , geno has a lot to be worried about , this is the same skeleton that attacked a whole amusement park thinking the roller coasters were out to eat his family","2585":"that s good to know , so if i use my death to take everyone out , i ll find him , he ll be the only one immune to it . . i m gonna go out on a limb and say he s a friend of yours ? but considering nova is just as powerful as reaper and was taken down by them . . i wonder if the scientists would stand a chance against reaper or be able to capture him , though unlike nova , reaper has a death touch and a lethal aura he can unleash , i don t think they could get near him unless they manage to wear him down it would be cool to see lyon though , he s even more of a mystery than nova i don t know much about him","2586":"you forget i m literal death , every universe has a version of death out there even if they aren t seen , they re there . . they won t be able to stop me if i decide to destroy their building and reap their souls , i guarantee i can find whoever that lion guy is easily and find the other complexes . .","2587":"for as much as you ve done for us , i wanna return the favor somehow and getting even with those scientists sounds like a good way to do it , i ll try to get them to tell me where the other . . complex ? reaper pauses since he doesn t know what a complex is","2588":"well i can stop by and grab gothy while i m out , knowing him he s probably been busy with palette","2589":"then it s settled , i ll be back soon love reaper then clinks his cheek","2590":". . nova can let me back in if i head out of here , right ? the death god turned to smile at geno i can send word to life and grab our kiddos once they re back","2591":". . reaper then gently pulls geno to him we ll get them back love . . i promise . . they won t stay gone . . they ll probably be mad we took so long to revive them though . . he chuckled a bit in a attempt to lighten the mood","2592":"reaper gets himself up to his feet and heads over beside him what s the matter love . . ?","2593":". . reaper rubs his eye sockets as he started waking back up , he ended up knocked out a while again . . geno . . ?","2594":"kinda funny when they named their kid raven dontcallmesans","2595":". . okay . . but o only for a little bit . . reaper then closed his eyes as he laid on genos lap at least until the room goes back to normal . . i don t wanna sleep the whole day away again . .","2596":"true but still . . i still worry about you love . . reaper then lays himself down on genos lap , wincing a bit mngh . .","2597":"reaper just smiles at his tsundere kinda ironic your worried about my skull when yours is the one that s melted . .","2598":"i always get those mixed up . . and that s true . . now that i think of it . . maybe that s why i never saw your frisk . . it s not that they avoided me , maybe they weren t there yet . . that means when i had to take off to face chara . . it took way longer than i thought it did . . reaper rubs his skull . . ow . .","2599":"huh . . well if your frisk is still alive in the classic timeline then you ll know if they truly stopped using the reset like they promised . .","2600":"well , i did first meet you back when you were still on the save screen with your frisk though your frisk stayed out of sight whenever i visited . . i had to stop my visits for a while though when chara went ahead and killed life and my scythe got stolen . . and i dunno about that . . if your frisk still has the power to reset , load and save , they can probably avoid that . .","2601":"you shouldn t worry too much about that , i don t have much up there to hurt reaper winks and lightly hits his own skull though he winces a bit afterwards . . maybe i shouldn t joke like that . . ow . .","2602":"heh . . i ll take that as a no then , i ve known geno for hundreds of years now but . . i m still not used to it . . he still surprises me . . even in reapertale i know i had a few people nice towards me but . . the majority wasn t . . i didn t go through the same exact things you did but . . i do understand what it must be like . .","2603":"huh ? oh , morning love , glad to see your awake reaper looks over his shoulder at geno and gave a faint smile","2604":". . do you ever get used to it ? reaper looks back up at her","2605":"reaper then stares down at the floor . . i i honestly don t know how to thank you . . it s not often anyone is nice to me . . usually the only person who is , is geno and he still shocks me with how much he cares . . it s like i m living in a completely different world . . . . i bet you felt the same after all you ve been through . .","2606":"true but i m more concerned about anons spilling the beans . . they always go out of their way to make things worse . .","2607":"you might wanna keep that hidden . . he won t be happy if he finds out you took a piece of his mirror . .","2608":"isn t that . . a piece of gasters mirror ?","2609":"reaper is now embarrassed since he s currently cuddled up to geno when nova walked in and proceeds to try and hide himself by sticking his skull under genos hoodie deaths not here , leave a message after the beep . . beeeep","2610":"reaper then happily nuzzles into geno it s easier said then done . . but thanks love","2611":"t thanks love . . just . . can t right now . . skullache . . reaper croaks out as he buries his skull into genos chest . . need a minute . .","2612":"reaper starts tugging on dontcallmesans sleeve , signaling that he can t deal with anons right now","2613":"i . . don t fully remember it . . reaper then held his skull . . b but he wanted her as overlord of heii ? a angel can t rule heii that s . . . ow . . he scoots over towards dontcallmesans and buries his skull into him","2614":"maybe it s hard not to collapse around someone cute like you ? reaper winks i think i might faint if you get any cuter","2615":". . i . . i don t remember . . much right now . . but i ll thank her next time we see her . . it s healed up right ? . . did . . i ask if you were okay yet . . ?","2616":"that s a good thing . . you can t afford to lose more of your skull . . reaper just gives a faint smile before holding his skull mngh . .","2617":". . y yeah . . i think so . . reaper rubs his skull . . if i wasn t . . i think . . you would be in a dress right now . . are you okay ?","2618":"oof at least they have plenty of time to rest there , a few hours pass before reaper finally wakes back up . . . g geno ?","2619":"reaper had sort of passed out by the time nova healed him but he ll thank her when he wakes back up though i guarantee geno is in panic mode after all they ve been through","2620":"h huh . . ? reaper opened his eye slightly when he heard geno yell what . . . . what sh wrung louve . . ?","2621":"reapers skull was seen with a small hole at the top and a large crack running right through it , how did he manage to do that ?","2622":"dontcallmesans when reaper refuses to get help and it p sses geno off xd","2623":"while geno was checking him over , everything seemed to be okay until he touched reapers skull , the god winced and tries to pull his hood down further but his aim was really off , he was grabbing at the air rather than his hood ghk . .","2624":"places of worship ? i but before reaper could say another word , he throws geno over to nova as he fell to the ground with a thud , oof","2625":"huh . . you know i ve never been anywhere where i ve seen towers like this . . i know i go out reaping in countless aus but it s not like i get to go sightseeing in whatever au i m in . . i m only there to reap souls and once my jobs done i leave to get the other souls on my list . .","2626":"oh . . it s a pretty big collection , you must of been in a lot of fights . .","2627":"ah okay xd so like she has heads from demons she s slain or items from people she s fought ?","2628":"reaper honestly looks confused . . i wanted to ask what a pagoda is but . . i thought it would make me look kinda stupid with my title and all . . he chuckled nervously","2629":"granted reaper is from ancient times where trophies and ect didn t exist and their beds are made from stone before a mattress even existed , reaper only has modern day items by stealing them from any modern day monsters humans he reaps which i think geno might be creeped out to know all their stuff came from all the humans and monsters reaper has reaped he walks over to the trophy room what are these ? ?","2630":"this is a house ? ? mod facepalms and only geno can call me a idiot !","2631":"oh . . right . . sorry . . i kinda forgot where we were . . wait . . nova has a bedroom ?","2632":". . i . . . uh . . kinda did that to all of our kiddos . . . reaper gives a nervous smile b but i was under hatred and not in my right mind . . doesn t change what i did though . . just trying to say i get what your talking about . . is there a way i can get to the human universe and reap those guys ?","2633":"so he s still around and it doesn t sound like he s done anything to you or you wouldn t protect him . . they probably would take him if they thought it would get you to go back . . reaper frowned a bit . . or . . i could reap those scientists for you ? i am in your universe now","2634":"my names bob mod facepalms , that joke might freak geno out lol and i don t need rest but you do","2635":"then nova it is but while we re on the subject , you said your dad gave you a name too ? i don t really hear you talking about your parents but then again it s not often anyone hangs out with death himself and actually tells him these things , i m surprised your this friendly towards me . . i mean . . my whole job is to reap souls of the dead . .","2636":". . i just forgot what we were talking about . . reaper paused as he tried to think . . you said if . . a lemon came in our room you d drink ? . . that doesn t make sense . .","2637":"you mean you never even knew your real name until you came here ? that s gotta be rough . . but nova or ashkari , your still the same person we all know , same with geno , whatever name he wants to be called doesn t change that he s still the same geno to me i could call myself bob tomorrow and everyone will still know i m the grim reaper he chuckled a bit just depends what you wanna go with","2638":"i crash landed in heii after trying to fight a demon who i guess is friends with nova and just scared her ? she got me out of there though . . reaper then scoops geno up in his arms and cuddles him","2639":"kinda like how geno gave himself that name when it s really reaper pauses as he glanced back at geno well i think you know what i mean . . you felt you didn t deserve your real name anymore . . didn t you . . ?","2640":"nova isn t her real name ? reaper looks confused","2641":". . are you okay ? reaper walked over to geno and offered him a hand you had one heii of a workout","2642":". . sorry kiddo . . reaper sighs you went through heii with humans and find out your entire race is dead , discovering you were part of a royal family . . i don t know how anyone would take that . .","2643":"your a . . princess ! ? reaper is in absolute shock , he looks really surprised i didn t expect to hear that at all . . i thought you would of went with it being a metaphor or coming out saying your really a goddess like life but a princess ! ?","2644":". . wait . . you said kingdom ? with the way you just acted right now . . i don t think that s just a metaphor is it ? like the humans saying their home is their castle ?","2645":"hey ! ! only geno can call me a idiot ! mod is staying out of this and renrink is my creator ! the mod just narrates for me . .","2646":"reaper is in shock honestly your acting like the reapertale gods . . are you okay . . ? ?","2647":"people scare eachother in october ? i thought that was in april ? reaper looks completely confused as he sat on the floor after ramming into the wall","2648":"wait what ! ? reaper stops in place after he kinda already attacked alastor lol","2649":"reaper unfortunately is the type to shoot first and ask questions later , he immediately flies into alastor with his scythe and slashes at him","2650":"uh . . we can finish talking later . . reaper then gets up and heads upstairs even though they were told not to , he can t just ignore screaming from what seemed like a totally peaceful place though he might look a bit silly with the pink flowered blanket still over his skull","2651":". . it was but we still had some problems , nothing like now but i remember you weren t comfortable living with me yet back then . . you would spend some time with me at our house but most the time you stayed on the save screen . . gothy didn t even know he had a mom when he was older until i took him to see you . . and it didn t help i had hatred i kept hidden from everyone back then . . i wasn t in my right mind and sent all the other kiddos we had to underfell and wiped your memory of them . . i even tried it with gothy . . geno might be shocked to know that one but paps and you were both aware of that one . . you both made sure he would come back from the babysitter . .","2652":"reaper is blushing bright blue now w well , you and gothy are what make it sweet . .","2653":"reaper because of his role as death god and the way he was taught , he always has to act a certain way and keep his emotions locked away so they don t interfere with job , he only shows how he really is around people he trusts , it s not often anyone gets to see him act like that but with geno he acts like a complete cinnamon roll when they very first met he wasn t nice towards him though , at the christmas party he was kind of a jack but he did flirt with him and tease him and when they first met on the save screen he was originally going to drag him down to the underworld until they talked , if you catch him around geno he acts a lot differently than when he s alone and you d probably freak him out by calling him cute","2654":"why don t you make me ? reaper just smirks","2655":"reaper was a bit confused and talked to himself did i say a pun without noticing ?","2656":"it took reaper a few minutes to notice he kinda made geno fall on top of him and if he had the blanket off it would look wrong lol . . you know , it s not everyday i have you falling for me","2657":"reaper then pokes his skull out of the blanket oh . . right . . uh . . maybe we should sit by that . . ? . . um . . thanks for helping us out by the way . . i think i know where goth got his awkwardness from lol","2658":"reaper is now hiding himself and geno under a blanket that was definitely meant more for their kids than themselves","2659":"reaper just hides himself and geno under a pink blanket with flowers all over it xd maybe he thinks they re camouflaged","2660":"or that happened lol reaper just stares up in surprise guessing your not a fan of paper ?","2661":"reaper started blushing when geno did that but it might be mistaken for a fever lol he then uses his wing to pull geno under the blanket with him i love you","2662":"this could be either a good thing or a bad thing lol reaper grabs a hold of the random letter he finds on the ground and looks it over . .","2663":"the death god was actually shivering and he even summoned his wings to wrap around both himself and geno . . i i ll grab one w when i can . . we ll have to thank her later . .","2664":"still , you could of woke me up reaper let out another sneeze and started hugging himself , scooting a bit closer to geno h hey . . love ? did . . nova give us blankets b by chance ?","2665":"lol since the actual word is censored he says aliven t","2666":"i didn t know that . . you were also asleep but you walked all the way back with me ? i could of flew us reaper then suddenly let out a sneeze","2667":"reaper sits himself up and looks around , sure enough he spots the camp fire and sees his tsun sitting beside him how d we get back . . ? did you teleport ?","2668":"after they were back , reaper started to wake back up after a while , rubbing his eye sockets mngh . . geno ?","2669":"reaper would of said a joke in response but he had actually dozed off on geno when they reached back to land , he must of been tired , maybe it s a good thing they didn t spend too much time in the water , he would of fallen asleep while trying to learn how to swim","2670":"https m . youtube . com watch ? v bsgp qi to","2671":". . i can see why you like the water now , it really is peaceful . . and it has a great view of a very cute skeleton reaper just smiles at geno","2672":"wat what plan ? v","2673":"they are among you xd the memes have begun","2674":"xd reaper and geno would suck at the game","2675":"dontcallmesans toxintale welcometomyspecialhell crossingoutnames","2676":"i won t sink if i have you keeping me afloat and you should ignore them , i think i m okay enough to go on a beach date . . . and see my cute angel topless seriously ? well at least his mind being back in the gutter is a clear sign he s recovering","2677":"you don t need to worry love , sorell is watching shino and gothy knowing him , is probably off with palette , i don t think anything will happen with just me and you out there you still have a iv though","2678":"no but i remember someone said they would teach me welp oops , mistakes have been made lol","2679":"yeah buuut . . we could still have some alone time you think nova would mind if we had fun in the lake ? nova then proceeds to set up signs that say no reapers allowed lol","2680":"aw come on love , you don t need to be a worry wart here , nobody can get us here . . in fact . . i bet if we go into that forest , we can have some fun nova screaming in the distance god no","2681":"you could say i ve fallen for you all over again reaper winks","2682":"i could try going without it now . . i don t think geno will approve of that that way i can take you flying around here . .","2683":"geno . . ? reaper noticed his tsundere beside him with the new iv but i don t know if nova is still there . . heh . . maybe i should of told you about that . .","2684":"mngh . . sure enough reaper does finally begin to wake back up and scans around the area looking for geno and nova since the last thing he remembers is standing beside them . . ?","2685":". . l love . . i reaper couldnt help but immediately start dozing off once he was laid back in bed , he couldn t even finish his train of thought , it wasn t due to lack of rest though , his iv bags were completely empty but i don t think geno noticed it yet , other than that he would of been perfectly fine , they had time to finally rest and recover","2686":"once he was helped up , something seemed off , right away you could tell it didn t seem like he was fully conscious , from the way he walked . . he was wobbling around as if he were just spun around times like he was going to immediately fall over again . . g geno ?","2687":"don t worry love . . i can find him if he ran off . . remember , nova travels around in the sky . . and i ca although reaper suddenly collapses in the middle of his sentence with a giant thud hitting the ground as his iv stand toppled down with him ghk . . !","2688":"i was thinking we could try west , nova said there was a coastline that way , i think huh ? reaper looks around . . did he run off ?","2689":"how did you find out about death berry ? did geno tell you about it ? and did geno give you my number ? either way i guess i should say thanks for the info , he doesn t sound like anyone we should hang around he texted back","2690":"reaper just looks at his phone to read the messages he got lol","2691":"well . . my shooting star did marry me","2692":"maybe she tried to protect you ? they could of had a thing against humans like most monsters do . . . . you know . . i don t think i ve ever heard you talk this much . . maybe we re officially friends now . . didn t think you d want death as your pal though reaper s trying to joke with her to lighten the mood since he knows this probably isn t easy for her to talk about","2693":"i m curious too but i m not gonna bug her about it if she doesn t want to talk about it . . it seemed to really upset her . .","2694":"i wonder . . if you were born here . . did your parents hide this place from you ? they could of taken you out of here and hid you in the human world . . . . you could explore with me and geno , you said you never traveled on the ground , there could be something to find and . . personally . . i haven t seen much outside of reapertale . . i travel across the multiverse to reap souls but its not like i get to go sightseeing in all the aus i visit . . if you ask me what any of the aus look like i don t think i could answer . .","2695":"versa . . ? i ll be sure not to go there but . . do you wanna tell us about it or . . ? . . how about you tag along with us ? it is your home we re wandering around in and i don t really know much about you or your home other than what you told me about the scientists and your powers . .","2696":"oof they probably should of packed first before immediately running off to solflare geno is gonna end up freaking out now isn t he ?","2697":"i was thinking that your home is a lot bigger than i thought . . and i gotta admit , it s really pretty here . . reminds me of lifes garden . . what s over east ?","2698":"jungle ? reaper tilts his skull . . we re in a jungle ?","2699":"reaper can fly with her although that might be a bad idea when he still has ivs hooked to him","2700":"why don t we explore a little ? she only told us to avoid the top of this building , she didn t say anything about the rest of the place reaper then pushes himself up and offers a hand to geno once he was on his feet besides i remember a certain someone drug me around on the surface to go sightseeing before","2701":"dontcallmesans reapers parenting skills lol","2702":"reaper then nuzzles geno alls fair in love and war , well not so much in the war part . . since we re both awake . . do you wanna have a date ? nova wouldn t mind . . right ?","2703":"reaper then gently pulls geno over to him so he can hug him sorry love . . just . . with everything that s happened . . i got really worried about you . .","2704":"oops reaper quickly starts waving his arms dismissively geno . . ! wait ! c calm down . . ! i i was just worried about you . . ! for once we aren t in danger !","2705":"reaper starts shaking dontcallmesans in a fit of panic","2706":". . . how does he stay cute like that","2707":"let this be a warning . . . if anyone goes after my family again . . i m ending them . . if ganz wants geno he ll have to go through me first !","2708":"aw . .","2709":"lol and here s a mini comic where reaper catches geno taking off his scarf","2710":"you should have seen when geno was fatal error lol","2711":". . curse you and your donuts . . curse you ! reaper grabs a donut and starts nomming on it even though he was curisng tessa lol why do i love donuts ? they re so good though . .","2712":"had geno hit on me first i am not used to that !","2713":"lol i don t know who i feel more bad for","2714":"i want to . . but i also . . know geno . . he s clearly . . in worse shape but he would . . be panicking . . and trying to help me instead . . if he s saw . . me right now . . i m gonna . . tell life . . in case the life flower didn t do anything . . . and tell goth to watch him . . reaper then collapses , he had went to the next room over so geno didn t see him fall , they re still in a hospital though so that might not go completely unnoticed , doctors might already be trying to patch up dontcallmesans and flipping out over him","2715":"t thanks kiddo . . but can you offer that to dontcallmesans instead ? reaper says before walking off into another room , holding his side , oof","2716":"trust me i m planning on it ! reaper is beyond p ssed and is showing off all his hidden abilities , abilities not even geno knew he was capable of , wonder how the tsun is reacting to this i m not just gonna reap him . . . i m gonna make him wish he were in the underworld instead of with me !","2717":"i think . . just really dead tired . . who are you though kiddo ?","2718":"wouldn t hurt to test that theory reaper then takes one of the echo flowers and places it on geno , sure enough , it acts the same as the regular life flowers and vanishes into sparkling lights that should heal anything wrong with geno aside from his permanent limbo state , you know the kiii wound and ect and that did shock me too . . i would of attacked him if . . he looks at all the equipment still hooked to him , though it s uncertain if geno would be comfortable enough to have reaper up and about after the horrific condition he s recently been in","2719":"i think they would use echo flowers , it s the only other flower i can think of to be a opposite of the life flower , so in their timeline all echo flowers would look like life flowers","2720":"ripping off your own limbs doesn t hurt you at all ? ?","2721":"since it was still given to them by a version of berry , it s no surprise that they find a stack of tacos wrapped in a blue bow along with some echo flowers ? their life flowers might look like echo flowers since their au is reversed , not everything makes sense in the swap aus , temmie is flowey in the normal swap timeline after all there was also some honey bottles in the basket , most the gifts seem completely normal until they find a stack of dead bunnies underneath it all . . . . is it me . . or does that version of berry have problems ?","2722":"hey , geno ? how much gold do we have ? dontcallmesans","2723":"i i . . i don t know . . . what the heii i is a gift basket ? ? reaper is beyond confused","2724":"y you mean you really weren t here to reaper then stares at the gift basket , he s never had or seen one so he pokes it , looking entirely confused uhh . . . thanks ? ? what just ?","2725":". . . . . . . .","2726":"w wait . . wait . . wait . . . what ! ? reaper looks unbelievably shocked then what ! ? but you geno is your what ! ?","2727":"actually not only that but reaper wasn t expecting a berry of all people to be fighting his geno either , he s usually a cinnamon roll by help . . do you mean reap ?","2728":"g geno . . ! reaper is staring in shock at his tsundere since he has honestly never seen him so protective , or at least , he s never caught it before , this is the first time he s seen it","2729":"oof indeed , not only is reaper offended but hearing that probably does not help dontcallmesans i its not that bad . . !","2730":"uh . . how do you know i m not altertale reaper ? . . yes altertale afterdeath does exist","2731":"reaper is now tugging on genos hand as he tries to get his attention","2732":". . uuuhh . . riiighhht . . . sure you are . . . and nope . . i m uh . . altertale sans they do look similar lol","2733":". . depends . . w why do you wanna know . . ? reaper gave a glare to death berry , i think geno might massively freak now dontcallmesans why are you even here . . ?","2734":". . on the . . bright side . . i got . . to see you . . in that nurse . . o outfit . . reaper then tugged a bit on genos hand you wanna .
