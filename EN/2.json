How'd you even know what happened?\n  ","2242":"\n  Geno..*Reaper just nuzzles him close, he's really worried about his Tsun* it's..I wish I could say it's okay..but..it won't be if you end up..\n  ","2243":"\n  ..*Reaper is giving Goth a cold glare now as he takes the IV from him and hooks it up to\n  \n   @DontcallmeSans\n  \n  * Kiddo..be lucky your my favorite..if you were Raven, I'd have knocked you to the floor..\n  \n  *SHEESH, that's one thing about Reaper, he says whatever is on his mind even if it's hurtful*\n  ","2244":"\n  *Reaper just rests his skull on top of Genos* For someone who nags at me all the time for doing things solo..you went and did the same thing..\n  ","2245":"\n  *Reaper actually bonks Goth on the skull with a fist when he starts crying*\n  \n  Quit the water works! Why don't you be helpful for once and grab that IV for me?\n  ","2246":"\n  S-sorry Love..*Reaper tries to loosen his grip a bit though he wasn't entirely able to stop smothering Geno, he keeps him held close*\n  ","2247":"\n  ..He RESET!? This IS BAD!! When has any of this NOT been bad!? Where the HELL have you been!? Up Palettes @$$ !? *REAPER*\n  \n  Your siblings are injured, I got the wind knocked out of me and your mom IS about to be your UNCLE!!\n  ","2248":"\n  *Reaper had Geno in a literal Death hug now, it was enough to make the Tsun very uncomfortable as he was smothered in a hug, his skull was just smushed against the Gods, if Reaper hugs him any tighter he might accidentally hurt him*\n  \n  ..You better NOT!! You hear me glitches! Go away! Geno is mine not yours!\n  ","2249":"\n  ..HE WHAT!? *Reaper actually looks horrified hearing that* Goth..WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED WHILE I WAS OUT!?\n  \n  *he was almost screaming at Goth he was so panicked*\n  ","2250":"\n  *Reaper honestly looks terrified, he was trembling*.. H-hey..you..you didn't mess with..? Please tell me you didn't mess with your Determination..Geno..I-I don't know what happened.. but.. you can't leave me like this! I'd be lost without you! *he then sits on the bed beside Geno and pulls him up into a tight hug*\n  ","2251":"\n  *Reaper gets himself up in a absolute fit of panic and rushes to Genos side* W-what happened!? Geno!? F-ck--if he really messed with--L-Love! Can you hear me!?\n  ","2252":"\n  W-WHAT!? *That managed to wake Reaper and he ends up falling off his bed and landing on the floor, honestly I'm shocked the giant blaster beast and explosions didn't, he must of been really out of it* OOF!! Geno..!?\n  ","2253":"\n  *Reaper seems to have fallen asleep the moment he hit Genos lap otherwise he would be trying to comfort Geno right now or at least notice he were picked up and moved back to his own bed*\n  ","2254":"\n  ..Heh..well you'll Death there to help you wreck him..*Reaper then lays his skull on Genos lap* but..right now..Death is..dead tired..not..doing good..\n  \n  *he then closes his eyes, oof, how is Geno handling this?*\n  ","2255":"\n  ..*Reaper frowned* Geno..you wouldn't want me doing anything that would hurt me.. it goes the same for me too..I wouldn't want you doing anything that would hurt you either..\n  \n  ..Honestly..if being Fatal didn't hurt you..I wouldn't care..to me, your still Geno.. but it DOES harm you.. I don't want that..\n  ","2256":"\n  ..Love..I'm as angry as you are over this..but..I know what your thinking..*Reaper lifts himself up a bit so his skull is directly in front of Genos* and.. I don't want you hurting yourself.. you panicked when I became a Error.. this isn't entirely different..being Fatal messes you up..doesn't it?\n  ","2257":"\n  ..Wait..Love..your not..? *Reaper then teleports himself to Geno although his teleport is a bit off and he ends up landing at Genos feet* Oof..! W-wait a sec..!\n  ","2258":"\n  Wait what!? *Seems Geno isn't the only one who forgot about that*\n  \n  Get me up so I can reap them!\n  ","2259":"\n  *Reaper is honestly stunned when he sees bones erupt around Genos bed, he didn't fully hear everything but he knows something had made him angry* L-Love..!?\n  ","2260":"\n  But...*Reaper frowned a bit, he really wants to put Radier in his place but he knows with all of their family in rough shape, Geno would probably have a Soul attack if he rushed off right now, so he gives in with a sigh*...Okay..I promise..I won't go after Radier..\n  ","2261":"\n  ..I just tripped..I'm fine..r-really.. I can go take care of Radier..just need a hand up first..anyone able to help me up? *Reaper doesnt like asking for help, at all but he knows if he doesn't right now, he'll be stuck on the floor*\n  ","2262":"\n  ..WHAT!? *Geno may have been quiet but Reaper was anything but quiet, he immediately gets himself up out of bed but he crashes onto the floor the moment his feet hit the ground* Oof!\n  ","2263":"\n  Geno..*Reaper motions for Geno to get beside him since he can't really move* what do you mean rescued her..? What happened?\n  ","2264":"\n  *Reaper puts his arm down and overall looks shocked to hear what Geno said* ..What..?\n  ","2265":"\n  I wouldn't mind that either..*Reaper then holds his arm out for Genos* but first I'm reaping the ones who put us all here to begin with..\n  ","2266":"\n  ..Heh, you still are a nervous wreck..*Reaper chuckled a bit* Love..it'll be okay, from what I can tell..everyone is still in one piece..but as soon as I get out of here I'm reaping whoever hurt our kiddos..and reaping that purple squirrel for landing me here in the first place..\n  \n  ... ...I'm..I'm still sorry I..I ended up here and couldn't even go check on you.. You were knocked out just as long as I was..\n  ","2267":"\n  ..I'm always doing better with you here..but are you okay?\n  ","2268":"\n  I did..? Sorry about that Love..*Reaper just gives Geno a faint smile*\n  ","2269":"\n  Heh..\n  ","2270":"\n  Huh?? W-what happened to Geno..!? *Reaper was now worried*\n  ","2271":"\n  *Aw..**Reaper unfortunately doesn't seem to hear Geno, he's still out cold beside his Tsun*\n  ","2272":"\n  They were real princes in DreamTale?! But that means they should of ruled over their DreamTale not the whole multiverse..right?\n  ","2273":"\n  Dream is a prince?? *Reaper looks genuinely shocked about that*\n  ","2274":"\n  *It was actually easy to do, his grasp was that weak his arms just fell when Geno moved, that normally isn't the case, it would usually be a pain for him to get away from Reaper*\n  ","2275":"\n  *Geno can hear muttering that sounds a awful lot like--*\n  \n  \"..b-bikini...Geno..\"\n  \n  *Yep that was definitely Reaper, dreaming about Geno in a bikini, some things never change*\n  ","2276":"\n  *Aw..**When he wakes up he will find his yanderes arms wrapped around his skull, Reaper had hugged him when they both fell asleep*\n  ","2277":"\n  Nurse: I think I've changed my mind then..\n  \n  Dr: That sounds a lot worse than just dying..ahem we will try to help him then!

That's Geno, he's a special case..those injuries are actually permanent.. there really is nothing we can do sadly..

O.o*\n  \n  *Reaper looks half asleep, he was even drooling on himself*\n  \n  ..Asgore? What am I dreaming right now..?
