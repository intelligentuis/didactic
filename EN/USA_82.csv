  Hi

   That's a reason why I would try that formula as well. To see what another person thinks of you, their perception. Also just gaining different perspectives of life, once the formula wears off, you'll still have that memory from within the mind of the other person.

  Dropouts are dropouts.... high school and under... you dropout of high school, you drop out of college...if you drop out of college, you have no career,if you have no career.... you have no money...no money means you have nothing to support yourself or a family.... who said you don't need money to be happy.... they lied... you need money to live. and I get it if you drop out because of financial problems or because you had no choice... but dropping out because you don't wanna do the work.? ?

  it's stupid.... gangs so freaking dumb. Its like people can't find better ways to represent who they associate with.

I met a few... like little kid... if you don't sit the hell down with your delusional ass... they think they're all hard until they mama come outside and beat they ass in front of their friends because they wanna be a thug. ?? and they STILL think they're all hard despite clear evidence to the contrary... pft. weak aassss

  Lol. wow that's mean. and completely unnecessary. Parents shouldn't do that. they should be fined for that or even do jail time. Not saying parents shouldn't hit their kids, because they should, depending on how bad the situation was and not posting it so the public can see. Posting these videos can mess up the child's future and it's so embarrassing... not only for the child but the parents as well.

   Opinion on : Five Year Old Girl in Alabama Severely Abused By StepDad In Opelika, Al.
  ","
  wow... That's sad... he gon do some jail time. ? How can this little girl get severely abused without people knowing... yea somebody knew. they just didn't care enough to say anything. People see little things and brush them off until it becomes a bigger problem. Kinda like when you have a small hole in some expensive jeans and you decide to wait a long time to stitch it up and Everytime you wear em, the hole gets bigger... then you end up having to throw em away. every time someone's being hurt, authorities always take their sweet time trying to resolve the issue. Then they start caring when finally, someone's life is taken.

   ok opinion on same sex couples adopting
  ","
  Let em do it. If I wanted to marry a woman and start a family, that shouldn't be anyone else's concern... love is love no matter who it's with. I support LBT couples. You can't just take someone's happiness away because they're doing something you don't like... TOTALLY legal btw. They're human too. They should be able to adopt children. :)

  "
441425,"
   Opinion on love?
  ","
  I feel like people always confuse love with lust... love isn't about intimate desires... it's about trust, feelings/emotions, spending time with the other person etc etc... lust however, is simply being focused on ones looks. Ladies, if a guy can't see past your beauty, let that Nigga go.
  "
441426,"
   opinion on suicide
  ","
  I think people who commit suicide are somewhat being selfish... however it's serious and it happens a lot. When I was 12, I thought that was the easy way out, I wasn't looking at the bigger picture. Then I grew up... and I'm glad I didn't do it. I think people who try to take their life intentionally aren't doing it for attention or because they're in pain. They're doing it because they feel hopeless and they think there's not reason to live. You'd be surprised how many friends you know that been through depression.

Not worry about things when going about my day in terms of my appearance or if I'm doing/wearing (or not wearing much if anything) something I wouldn't want others to see, assuming I don't need to be visible for the day. The thing about what I wear deoends how the invisibility works, like if it only makes me invisible then I'd be in the nude more likely.
  
  3). Walk in the park near me or something and observe people and animals (animals being harder to do so with because they have more keen smell/hearing, but it could still help me get closer without their notice).

   What would you do if one random day an animal starts talking to you in a language you can understand?
  ","
  Probably positive feelings if it could only talk to me, negative if it could talk to anyone (I'd feel bad for it if it got captured or have to try to prevent it from being found which is a headache), I also partly don't like the idea of pets because there's not that clear two way communication.

   Do you believe some ppl shouldn't be allowed to own pets?

  Yeah, me, don't try to sell or give me any. I don't believe in the concept of pets, it feels too similar to slavery and/or a fake relationship with way too much leverage and lots of work.

   Cats or dogs?

  Cats, I don't want either as pets though, I don't want any pets myself. Sure they could give you some oxytocin, but it just feels like a fake relationship or with way too much leverage. They basically can't live without you, fully domesticated. I like animals, just not the idea of pets.

   What's the chance of getting your reply if I am unknown?
  ","
  If it's somewhere I check my messages, chances are very likely I will respond, I respond to strangers all the time. It's not like I'm a celebrity or famous in any way at all. Heck, there's even times where I start a conversation with someone that sends me friend requests on discord or other platforms because like what's up? You added me. I know some people just like to have people they like/respect on their friends list and I respect that though. I don't press people.

442795,"
   What is the most boring job you can imagine?

  Usually my brain, following my heart more than not leads to undesirable outcomes.

442799,"
   Only some of us are able to follow our heart. This is what makes people happy. Are you happy?

  I think it's a case by case basis whether you should follow your heart or mind. That doesn't mean we are good at knowing when to do which. What even is a ""right choice"" but defined by the chooser?

  I'm picky with that stuff, I'd still want to be able to do what I do now in whatever world I travel to, there's also that you could just be a background character in the game/show/movie/book/novel. That I don't mind, I would want it to be a world with things I find interesting, that isn't exceptionally harder to live in, and one in the digital age or further where I could have my own computer and such. I probably wouldn't go through any portals unless I was about to die or wanted an escape really bad.

  Too close? Oh, actually, not really. I did think of someone. Too close as in closer than I wanted them to be I assume.

   Worst thing about being ticklish?

   What makes you sad?
  ","
  Sad songs and occasionally songs that aren't sad, mostly. Other media can make me sad too. Life can also sometimes make me sad.
  "
443120,"
   Were you in a relationship with someone before???
  ","
  Before what? I've been in a few relationships.
  "
443121,"
   Who's your favorite Looney Tune?
  ","
  Me.
  "
443122,"
   What's your biggest problem of ur life?
  ","
  That it will end someday.
  "
443123,"
   What's something that can always make you feel better?
  ","
  There's nothing that can always make me feel better that I know of, loved ones wouldn't be far from it though.
  "
443124,"
   what's something you would never want to tell anyone?
  ","
  Something that I would also not air on social media most likely.
  "
443125,"
   I forgot what the question was, I don't really have any crushes, I just like said person. I don't think I've ever crushed based on how it is defined anyway.
  ","
  Correct.
  "
443126,"
   What is something you think everyone should do at least once in their lives? 💕
  ","
  Fall in love, it can really change someone without much effort, change perspective, inspire, etcetera.

   The grocery shelves will soon be stocked with seasonal specialty items. What is your favorite pumpkin spice food-item?
  ","
  Pumpkin pie. xD
  "
443130,"
   What's the craziest thing you've done?
  ","
  Most times when I do something crazy, it's because of my forgetfulness. I once forgot my glasses at work and didn't realize until I was halfway home for instance.
  "
443131,"
   What's the most daring thing you ever did?
  ","
  When I think daring, I think of bravery, and bravery requires fear. So I would say public speaking, heights, and deep water at different points. If you mean daring as in risky, that's another way it could go.
  "
443132,"
   What do you consider to be a healthy relationship?
  ","
  One where there is a good ratio for positive and negative feedback, as in, at least 5 to 1 (feedback might not be the word, I'm talking pretty general like saying positive things and actions that portray such). This is not usually something you have to worry about for budding relationships, more so after being together for a year or two.
  
  One where there is little manipulation, especially concious manipulation, and none or almost no malicious or selfish manipulation.
  
  One where there is no abuse. Abuse refers to a pattern, I don't strictly mean physical abuse either.
  
  One where each party wishes the best for the other(s) even if it might mean the relationship ending, at least after thinking on it for long enough.
  
  One where each party can have friends of any gender and hang out with them without stressing any other party out. Not saying jealousy is shameful, just that it is something you can't let take over you or your relationships. It's also important to trust partners.
  
  Assuming a traditional monogamous or non-open poly relationship: one where parties don't seek romantic/sexual intimacy with those that are not their partners.
  "
443133,"
   How many hours do you sleep at night?
  ","
  On average I sleep close to 8 hours a day. I don't have a sleep tracker though and I don't log when I go to sleep and wake up each day. I have thought of doing that though, out of curiosity and because I like playing with data. I would need a device that tracks sleep if I want the data to be accurate though. I know Fitbit does that, but I don't want to put down a few hundred just for one function.
  "
443134,"
   What harsh truths do you prefer to ignore?
  ","
  Mostly just death.
  "
443135,"
   Would you rather go out for dinner or cook at home?
  ","
  Cook at home, frugal and more personal/private. I like going out, it just costs money I'd rather spend elsewhere most of the time. In terms of eating anyway. There are ways of going out that don't hurt your wallet much or at all too or that I feel is more worth the costs.
  "
443136,"
   How do you feel about aromatherapy? You like or maybe you want to try it?
  ","
  I don't think I have the right mindset for it, because I think it works on placebo a good degree. I also don't have great smell.
  "
443137,"
   How many books you read?
  ","
  I only read books that will inspire me creatively, not super often. I prefer fantasy, medieval fantasy close to the top.
  "
443138,"
   It's not even Halloween yet and I'm already seeing Christmas stuff for sale.  What's your favourite time of the year?

  I'm a big Halloween guy. I may not personally celebrate Halloween much, but I love the styles and themes associated with Halloween.

  "
443141,"
   Who is your latest crush?
  ","
  Filipino, Brunette and Petite. Their favorite colors are teal, mint blue, and the like. Not so much cyan or neon blue. Subtle colors preferred, no high contrast or anything that pops too much and centers attention.
  "
443142,"
   Do you prefer to travel by train, bus, plane or ship?
  ","
  I assume you mean subway by train. This list does not consider cost efficiency for whatever distance.
  
  1) Plane
  
  2) Train
  
  3) Bus
  "
443143,"
   What animal is your biggest fear?
  ","
  Probably either a Komodo Dragon or whatever the most aggressive of large bear species. Gorillas are up there too.
  
  I would say snakes, but honestly, I think they are less dangerous than all of the above in the wild on average.
  
  I don't have any inbuilt fear of any particular animals that I know of, just basing it off rational fear.
  "
443144,"
   What is your favorite way to spend a Saturday?

  Dungeons & Dragons or with loved ones, which the former does not exclude. Assuming I have the Saturday off.
  "
443145,"

  "
443146,"

  ","
  I know a few or more words and maybe a phrase or two. ""Mi casa es su casa!' for instance.
  "
443147,"
   If you were going to be stuck on an island with three celebrities, which three would you choose?

  If we were just stuck for a short period:
  
  1) Daniel Radcliff

  3) JaidenAnimations
  
  If we were stranded for a long time to life:

  The numbers are just to make this easier to read, not to order most to least.
  "
443148,"
   In what case you can justify lies?
  ","
  When the result outweighs the means. There are plenty of reasons. One could be lying to an abuser that would abuse you or someone else if you tell the truth.

   How do you feel about yourself?
  ","
  Neutral with a positive lean, on average.

   Craziest childhood memory?
  ","
  There was this time I forgot about almost every childhood memory, it was crazy. The only childhood memories I can think of that might be considered crazy, I'd rather not speak of, especially or at least on social media (not anonymous here).
  "
443165,"
   What is the most dangerous thing you have ever done?
  ","
  I really don't know. I know I've done dangerous things and almost or nearly passed to the other side as most have. I don't know how to judge and it has to be something I did, I also don't have great memory. Being in a dangerous situation, inaction that led to danger, danger being imposed on me, these are not cases of me doing something dangerous. Just cases with danger involved.  Sometimes I feel leaving it at ""I don't know"" probably saves the time of everyone involved, but it feels cheap.

  An office worker. Not that I blame them. Also a lot of office electronics.
  "
443169,"
   If you see really cute person in public place standing alone , what do you do ?
  ","
  Nothing. I don't know them and they don't know me. If I have a reasonable reason to talk to someone and they don't seem standoffish, I will. Otherwise, I feel it is an uneeded invasion of space.
  
  Having good intentions is nice, but I prefer to have more than good intentions, to think things through. More than sometimes people are alone because they want to be.
  
  Maybe it's partly because I can sort of relate in that I'm usually off in my head somewhere when alone and hope people don't think I'm lonely when happily/deeply thinking or daydreaming. I also know people that want to be alone sometimes and ones that don't like being approached in public.

  You have to think if you fantasize about doing romantic as well as private, very intimate, things with them. Otherwise it's not necessarily a romantic/sexual attraction. If so, then you could see if they feel the same then take it from there.

  I mean, yes, but I don't think people should think that they can change anyone. It has to come from within, they have to want to change themselves (honestly). Often times people lie about wanting to change themselves as a form of manipulation too.

  I used a Spanish translator and it gave me ""How quickly do you fall in love?"" I don't know the answer to that question, I think I fall in love quickly, but that's also based on my experiences where there a ton of interaction and so that probably speed the process up. Talking about when there's mutual romantic interest/feelings and you are seeing them. I think if I took things slow, I would fall in love at a more average rate. Then again, I don't know what the average rate is.

  I don't think I had a hero or idolized anyone in my childhood. Same for today. There are people I admire, several that I do and don't know. Maybe that's why I don't have a lot of direction in life, I don't have someone or one person that I want to be like and follow in the steps of. Not that I'm complaining, I feel like that would be restricting. Maybe it doesn't feel that way from he inside though.

  The furthest I've gone is about 750 miles (geographic distance), in terms of actions, I can go pretty far, but if I can't sense that it is mutual then I'll shut down. If I just simply don't sense whether it is or isn't mutual, unsure, then I won't go nearly as far either. I'm not sure how I feel about the concept of love though, I'm almost a different person when I'm in love. by that I don't mean my personality , just certain things change in terms of what I want and I take a lot more risks. I guess depending on whether you look at it in a good or bad light you could say passionate or unreasonable. It's probably the same for everyone, I'm just not sure how I feel about it. It feels good, but on the other hand there are certain things in my mind that change that when I'm not in love I see differently and feel is the right way to see it.

  In terms of it being on purpose and not assumed I would say it is because they felt they were not in the wrong, because they disagree that it was wrong, or they just don't want to admit they were in the wrong as it would hurt their pride or make them feel less significant (shorter). There's also a chance they think it is just assumed depending on the circumstances. I'll sometimes not say it, but also say it indirectly and express it. There's also times I just forget or don't think to say it.

   Does one of your senses provide a more ""real"" experience for you, than the others, which and why? :)
  ","
  Maybe sight, because I love aesthetics, colors, patterns, and to create such things. Also because my hearing isn't what it used to be, I would rate hearing as my number two, especially with music and other pleasant or enjoyable sounds, taste is somewhere after and smell might be in last place (it is also my worst sense as far as I know.
  
  I'm not sure where I would put touch, I know it increases the release of oxytocin and prolongs life as well as functioning life. Well, when between humans anyway, or other similar beings. Then there's also that I would rate touch as my number one love language or at least at the top. However, it doesn't do anything for me artistically or creatively. It could inspire creativity, but it's not as much an expression of creativity I mean (not that it isn't or can't be, just not to as high an extent for me). I know it would be above smell for sure, i'd say above taste as well. When it comes to auditory and visual stimulus nothing can top the visual part. I might tie it with the sense of hearing or put it a bit above it. Yes, I can still imagine sounds and sights after losing those senses, but imagining isn't the same because you will never hear or see anything new and you'll forget details of things you have seen and heard as time goes by at least for most things. Plus for sight it would mean I couldn't really draw or design visuals and create digital art anymore, not in the way I enjoy doing such things anyway. It would also make a lot of things impossible that I enjoy doing as well, not just robbing my of aesthetics and things I would enjoy seeing alone.
  
  I'd say the sense of touch provides the realest experience to me, I don't know how to express why that is the case at least not yet, I've never thought about it. Part of it is that I don't really experience touch in dreams, not like I do with the other senses.

   Thoughts on those who have crush on you??
  ","
  I appreciate the positive feelings, I don't really have any specific thoughts on groups of people that I don't know though. I mean, In not great at reading when someone has a crush, partly because I reallt don't like to assume I imagine. Reason why I don't like to assume is because I imagine it from the other side if it was a bad assumption. Someone thinks you like them or want to talk to them for such reasons, things of that nature. This is why I rarely approach women, because heterosexual attraction is the norm and it is often seen as interest or flirting when someone of the opposite sex initiatiates interaction, especially if they seem interested in talking. This doesn't mean I never initiate conversation or interaction with the opposite sex, but only when it's automatic or seems a natural occurrence or follow-up to something that happened. Also of course if it is someone I am already acquainted with.
  "

   May real men cry?
  ","
  I don't believe in such a thing as a ""real man"" just as I don't for the term a ""real woman"". People crying in general tends to make me uncomfortable because I feel bad for them and more so if I don't know how to effort them or am not close enough to possibly know. That doesn't mean I think anyone should hold it back. I resent that I don't know how not to hold it back because it's become an ingrained habit I guess. Can't remember how to let go (I'm sure I did when I was a baby and up to kindergarten possibly). Happy crying doesn't make me uncomfortable of course.

  My favorite songs are usually ones that get me really hype/hard or sad, both is even better. I also love good creepy/horror-like music.
  
  I guess it's a cathartic sort of feeling for the sad ones and I can just dig the mood/beat in them, if that makes any sense. The hype/hard songs because they can make me feel pumped and like I can do most anything. Hopsin is an example of rap in that category, he's probably still my favorite rap artist along Tupac Shakur.
  
  I also find some songs like a decent portion of love songs sad, like A Thousand Years for instance. I guess because the associated memories with the subject.
  
  Billie Eilish, Ava Max, Lana Del Rey, Marina & the Diamonds, and DubstepGutter are some of my more recent favorite artists. I have way too many overall and would take several hours to compile them all in a list.

  I really don't have a favorite quote. The ones I reference or say/type the most are references to entertainment or media in some way (occasionally things friends have said).

  My secrets are secret.
  
  1. My personality is more calculated before I get to know whoever it is I'm around. Probably always a bit more calculated, but less of a filter or a feeling of needing as tight of a filter.

  3. I don't like rushing and usually try to make sure there's more time than I need to do things or get ready, what have you.

   What question do you ask yourself a lot?
  ","
  Recently: Who's asking me all these questions on AskFM?
  
  Overall: I don't know that there's been a consistent frequent question I ask a lot over my entire life or as far back as I can remember.
  
  Maybe this is slightly off topic, but you know that feeling you get sometimes? Maybe after you wake up or after a morning shower. I don't think I've had it in years, but I remember having it at least more than a few times all thd way back to my very young days. I don't know why these events are so significant that I remember them along with the feeling back so far when nothing even really happens in the memories.
  
  Basically, a feeling of being out of place, it's not so much an emotional thing, more physical and a feeling (not talking about after making big changes/decisions or after changing scenery/moving house). Like your life feels alien and you feel so distant from everything, especially your surroundings, everything familiar. It certainly happen even when surrounded by friends and family.

   What is the appropriate age for marriage?
  ","
  25 or so in terms of having a mostly developed rational brain and focus. Maybe not appropriate, but the best for making any long term decisions. This is not to say I think people getting married younger is inappropriate, that they are not mature enough, or that it won't last. Just that the odds aren't as good. Really, having a rational mindset doesn't even matter if it doesn't factor into your decision because you are madly in love anyway (or other reasons). So all is fair in love and war, so they say.

  Sexual orientation, just like everything welse is a result of the interaction between nature and nurture.
  
  Pets are not at all nearly as anthropomorphic as we believe or wish they were. This has little to do with the intelligence of pets. It has to do with human desire to find human-ness in our surroundings or anything that resembkes us.

   What's the first thing you notice in a person of the opposite gender?
  ","
  I'm not that consistent. I'll just list what I think are my top for appearance and otherwise five in order from what I notice first the most to least.
  
  Physical appearance:
  
  1) Hair.
  
  2) Makeup. High on the list for when it is very noticeable anyway. Contrast, deep/saturated colors.
  
  3) Faces: expression/structure.
  
  4) Height and Figure.
  
  5) Butts (would be higher if butts were on the front). Don't worry though, I don't get aroused when I look at your butt (99%+ of the time if you are a stranger, much less so if we have a sexual/romantic connection). It's more of a fascination and I will get an image in my head when I don't even look at it and it comes up in my peripheral. When I do get aroused its sometimes just that I happened to get a random erection at a fitting time or I haven't done anything in weeks.
  
  Boobs don't make the list. (probably belongs higher on the list, I just don't typically care about them. Sometimes I'll be accidentally staring at them while daydreaming or spacing out (thinking or too tired to think)). Don't get me wrong, boobs can be fun, but they are not really an object of sex in my mind. They can compliment a figure well though.
  
  When talking (even more guessing):
  
  1) Voice.
  
  2) Whether a Shy or Outgoing personality.
  
  3) Sense of humor.
  
  4) Mood.
  
  5) Connection.

  Depends how you mean it, I use to find it hard to accept that we had to part ways (friends) when I was young, now it's more that I want to make sure the goodbye is appropriately timed and mutual. I mean, I don't necassarily want to leave, or for them to leave, but my mind is more occupied nowadays of course and I'm more used to it as well as knowing I'll almost certainly see them again.
  
  In the case of saying goodbye forever because of death or another reason, I find that harder of course.

  "
443408,"
   How far would you go for the one you love?
  ","
  Further than I probably should as long as I can deduce that it is mutual. I feel as if the me in love and the me not in love are two very different people and they can both observe themselves and the other self. It's strange. A lot of my views, ideas, and desires change. In terms of ideas/views I try to be more consistent, also, how they change hasn't changed based on who the target is either. So I'm not saying I adopt the targets views.
  
  I would also say the me in love is more bold or passionate in terms of expression through art for the most part. Sort of like having a muse.
  
  Maybe you could argue that the me in love is just more honest/emotional and less pragmatic/logical. Some of it is also just biological. Like how I will change my mind on kids for instance. Where when I'm not in love I think about it logically, but also less passionately. I think about how I wouldn't want kids until I'm in an optimal place financially and once I learn a lot about raising children, child psychology, and have a good mindset going into it so that it is my best effort. There have also been times where I've thought getting a vasectomy to prevent the in love me from doing anything stupid in the future. I also feel that having kids shouldn't be as easy as it is biologically when it is a huge responsibility and that the process of adoption is closer to how it should be. I know there isn't exactly equal treatment with the adoption process in the US, but it's much closer to an ideal system than sex which is pleasurable and easy (between heterosexual or bisexual individuals of of the opposite sex).

  ","
  I recognize Muslims as a people and Islam as a religion. I've had a relationship with someone that practiced Islam, but I don't assume everyone that practices it practices it in the same way. I generally don't assume things about individuals based on a group they belong to or other individuals in that group. There's a very wide range with every nationality, religion, and more for what people believe, how they express that belief or just how they live and the decisions they make. I don't believe it's right to tell anyone how they ought to live or dress as long as it doesn't harm anyone (for those that do choose to veil in western countries).

  ","
  Huh? Does this question assume I feel most people don't like me? Maybe when I'm in certain moods. I mean... it certainly is possible. It would be rude if they made it obvious.
  
  There's two ways I'm seeing that I could read this: ""Why do you feel like so many people don't like you?"" and ""What to do when you feel like so many people don't like you?""
  
  You could also mean not liking someone as being neutral towards thrm rather than disliking them or not caring for them.

  No. They could be. They could also be a cool cat. I wouldn't necessarily say they are over-confudent either. Maybe they are, confident, friendly, and a jokester. Thinking of a certain person I know. I am not close to them, but I don't think they are shallow. I don't think they are superficial or incapable of deep thought.

I don't have the best memory and usually think about things before I say/text it, so that it won't be something I'll regret. I've definitely said awkward things to all of those that were special to me I'm sure. Off the top of my head I can't think of anything though.

   Closest friends at sn
  ","
  I don't know what SN is. Is it a physical place, a place on the internet, or what? Social Networks? I don't really have any close friends on social networking places that I don't talk to in real life face to face. I have some distant friends or past close friends that I haven't talked to in s long time. Not that anything happened other than life.

   What's on top of your birthday wish list?
  ","
  In terms of practicality probably a portable phone charger, power bank. I can't find my old one, it's probably still here I just don't know where (been a couple months) and don't feel like wasting money on another when I might find it.
  
  I know for a fact my air mattress is still here somewhere and I can't find it, that also makes me more confident that my power bsnk is still here and I just am unable to find it. I'm 99% sure I didn't have my power bank in a position to be lost at Ohayocon at any time. Only had it out when it was charging my phone or in my pocket after fully charging it rhen back in my backpack.
  
  Oh my god! I just found it in my backpack after searching for half a dozen seconds. I remember fully emptying all my bags multiple times to look for it. What the hell.
  
  So, one of the things at the top of my wishlist is probably Naokai Urasawa's Monster, the DVD set. It's not on any streaming service or anle to be purchased digitally to watch on any device either. Only streaming services you can find it on are ones like kissanime. I watched it on one of those websites because I didn't feel like dumping tons of money on a show just to watch it for the first time. Dubbed would be preferred because part of the reason I want it is to get friends to watch it and some might be turned off by having to read subtitles while they watch. I've seen both already anyway (zubbed and dubbed).

  ","
  If the pause button is unlimited in how msny times I get to pause and for how long and the rewind button is unlimited in how many times I can use it I would choose the rewind button. I'll assume there is no consequence to either and that I retain my prior memories when rewinding (not perfectly like all memory) because otherwise it's useless.
  
  I could go mad either way. If I wanted time to think, either would work (could keep going back to think). If I wanted to prolong living or live forever, either would work. If I wanted to live forever in ongoing time, one would work, if I wanted to undo/redo only one would work.
  
  Rewind is easily superior. There is nothing you can do with pausing that you can't do with rewinding given ""time"".

   A line from your😘👩👧👨 favorite song
  ","
  I don't have a single favorite song above all others. I love several songs/pieces from practically every genre of music (sans modern country). I can love a song for just vocal chords, beat, lyrics (smart, deep, or rhythmic), message, and more.
  
  I'll go with:
  
  ""Woke up this morning, heard someone snoring.
  
  Knobheads going on about modern life is boring.
  
  Bears have their own music, no-one can prove it.""
  
  You can guess why I love this track, a couple or a few reasons from the list above and not really any of the others.
  "
443477,"
   Which word do you 🙃😗😧👩👦want everyone to stop using?
  ","
  Irregardless! Nonsensical and redundant word. Why did they add it to the dictionary? Why?! Both the prefix and suffix do the same thing. Regard and regardless covers all bases, there's even disregard. Besides, without without regard being a double negative means it should be positive, double negative, negative negates negative. So irregardless means regard, not regardless. When you say irregardless, you are saying with regard to whatever it may be (not without regard to it). I might say it as a joke or as satire now and then, but never seriously.
  "
443478,"

  Respect and empathy. By that I mean a few things, respect in that they won't try to change me or anything about me (at most maybe caution me against things they see as harmful). Empathy in caring and being considerate. So basically I want my friends to be like me. xD
  
  Oh, and either fun or a deep thinker if I can add another. So we have something to talk about/do (outside of personal talk and the regular). If they are both, even better.
  "
443479,"
   What one😌😍😔😶 thing would you do to change the world?
  ","
  If I listen to my greatest fear, death. I would have there be no death or that conciousness transfers on death. I know there are beliefs that follow that thinking, I just don't believe there's anything after death. I had a neat dream recently where I died in the dream and my conciousness remained, no visuals outside of imagination. Not sure if I'd enjoy my conciousness wandering without any stimuli like that. I will say I'd rather live forever and endure that over living a finite amount of time.
  
  If I think pragmatically, I might choose something like wealth distribution to be distributed more evenly. I could also just have sympathy and empathy to a fair or high degree in everyone (for more than just your family/friends and who you know) and it could work itself out. Also for being greedy to not be as rewarding with our brain chemistry. Poverty causes or at least is linked to many ills.
  
  Is this question what I would realistically do to change the world rather than asking what I would do if I could granted no restriction? I assumed the latter.
  "

   Would you😘😕🙁😯😭👦 prefer to have the power to fly or be invisible?
  ","
  I would rather have the power to be invisible by far. I could just recreate the feeling of flying if I wanted by doing something like gliding. Being invisible has a lot more uses and you can't really experience it outside of being very stealthy which you can't do nearly as much with. Probably the fact that I hid a lot and snuck around when I was little gives away my answer (to surprise others or to not be seen). I do play stealthy classes sometimes in RPGs, but usually a tank or cleric. A class that works well with a team outside of providing high DPS. Anyway, I could even haunt others, not sure I would though, that could more likely lead to me being found out. I wouldn't move things in front of their face anyway.

  This site is way too toxic. It is way too easy for people to get harassed on here and the saddest thing about that - is that AskFm doesn't do anything about it. Their blocking option is so dumb! The fact that the person you blocked can still see your page and follow you, is stupid. People on here are extremely rude, gullible, childish, toxic, and weirdly out to get people? I would never recommend this site to anyone. This site is perfect for people who are genuinely shitty, but for people who have a heart and are genuine.... this is not the site to be on.

  So much has been on my mind lately. I took several days off of social media do to the fact my sister is in the hospital. I don't have the desire to come back fully, just want to make this post and share my thoughts/feelings. I think I'm done with social media if I am being completely honest. I don't find it to be a positive place at all, I find it to be very negative and that's not what I want. I'm realizing what is important to me and I want to focus on that right now. Who knows, I might come back to social media someday, but as of right now, I'm staying far, far, away.

  ","
  Thank you for following! And I'm glad you liked my post. Honestly, I was at rock bottom with my mental health when I had that account. Every time I would look at it, it would make me hate myself even more than I already did at the time. It was so depressing and sad: I couldn't stand the sight of it. I'm still open and more than willing to talk about my struggles with mental health and my journey of healing from my past. The reason I don't talk about it on here, is because my followers on here aren't people who followed me on my previous account. I feel like things have changed since I created this account and the people who genuinely cared are no longer on here. Plus I'm mentally stable nowadays. I'm also pretty burnt out from social media and you can tell that I really don't care anymore and that I'm not really trying.

   Is it okay for adults to swear? If it’s not, why doesn’t it seem reprehensible anymore? Should it be reprehensible? If it’s okay, why shouldn’t minors be allowed to swear since it doesn’t seem harmful?
  ","
  Swearing is a sin and goes against God. We shouldn't swear, but sense this world particularly worships the devil - we go against God. It takes worshipping Jesus, praying and spending every day in the Word, not to sin against him. But no Christian is perfect. We all sin and fall short of the glory of God. It's hard to not fall into temptation from a world that's so evil.

   How can you tell you are being manipulated?
  ","
  It's hard at first but once you know the signs it's pretty easy to tell. You first have to understand what manipulation looks like which is: Someone who is emotionally manipulating you may do so in subtle ways, like judging and criticizing your actions. They might make a mean comment about your choice of friends, for example. Another sign of emotional manipulation is trying to create feelings of embarrassment or guilt. There's Psychological manipulation too that you can look up.
  
  Here are some ways: You feel fear, obligation and guilt. You’re questioning yourself (aka they're gaslighting you). There are strings attached (If you don’t meet the manipulator’s expectation, you will be made out to be ungrateful). You notice the ‘foot-in-the-door’ and ‘door-in-the-face’ techniques. Plain Old Bullying. They pull the ""If You Really Loved Me..."" Emotional Blackmail. Playing The Victim (THIS IS A HUGE ONE). Gaslighting (ANOTHER BIG ONE). Convenient Neediness, they're always ""joking"".
  
  What to do if you think you’re being manipulated? Talk to a therapist or call the National Domestic Violence Hotline as they know what to do. Try not to let the manipulators behavior affect you personally. I know that's easier said then done but it's really important to not let them get to you.
  
  Some more: Stubborn Headedness, Knowing Your Weaknesses, Creating Confusion, & Being Passive-Aggressive. Most of the manipulators are pathological liars. Psychological manipulators are often what they call emotional vampires or parasites. That means that they will make you feel bad whenever they feel bad, or make you feel guilty because they feel bad. They pressure you. Manipulators will often yell or put you in an uncomfortable situation because of their behavior. (Stone cold/letting you take the initiative) Manipulators will let you speak first because this allows them to get to know your opinions, emotions or even weak spots.

  Both of my parents died when I was three and my grandpa died when I was twelve. Those three deaths have had the biggest effect on me.

Not only my birth parents but even with my adopted family. The holidays have always been another big struggle for me too. I guess what helped me, was that I did have some family to help me but also therapy. I might have gone to therapy for a completely different reason, but I was uncovering a lot of past trauma that I realized I never fully grieved those deaths.

  When you have so many people leave your life at such a young age, it's damaging. Both my parents died when I was three years old. My only friend in preschool moved. My best friend in kindergarten moved, my other best friend in 1st grade stopped talking to be after her dads accident. I stopped having friendships and told myself I didn't need friend and that I didn't want friends. I was so scared of losing another person that I loved and cared about that I ended up hurting myself. Even years later when I got older, I had two best friends Sammie and Michelle. They were like sisters to me, we did everything together but I was dating the worst girl at the time and she threatened them to leave my life. After that I stopped completely. Even today I find it hard to make friendships because of what happened. Toxic relationships play into my abandonment issues too; but shit... I'm ok with being alone nowadays because I know people aren't meant to stay.

  ","
  I can only speak out of personal experience. Intensive therapy helped me the most (and regular therapy). It's important to feel your emotions and identify where they're coming from. Allow yourself time to heal and do not get upset with yourself. PUT YOURSELF FIRST! Make sure the people you are surrounding yourself with care about you and are people you can count on. Sometimes the one hurting has to speak first. Let others know how you're feeling in the best way you can possibly describe it. Get out of the house when you're feeling depressed; it's ok if when you're out and about that you still don't feel the greatest. It's not always about feeling good while doing things, allowing yourself to be surround by positive does better your feelings over time. Challenge your negative thoughts. Tell them no because they're lying to you. Every negative thing you've ever felt; is a lie. Daily affirmations are helpful.

  -Avoid 'should' and 'must' statements. If you find that your thoughts are full of these words, you might be putting unreasonable demands on yourself — or on others. Removing these words from your thoughts can lead to more realistic expectations.
  
  - Remind yourself that nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes. That's how we learn.
  
  -GET MOVIN!
  
  -Do what makes YOU happy.
  
  -Celebrate the small stuff because they're important.
  
  -Do something creative.
  
  -Get clear on your values.
  
  -Heal your past.
  
  -It's very important to stop worrying about what others think and to stop yourself from overthinking.

  Nope! I would love to adopt someday. I have three kids. My eldest was conceived through r%pe and I was forced to give her up for adoption. It can at times, but it's so worth it!

   I can relate to the feeling that you'll never find the right person and you'll have to date yourself. lol. dunno why you suddenly mention in a platonic way? that would just be friends hanging out and not a date. but yeah, that's nice too. ?
  ","
  Shh... it's cuter if you say it's a date. Lol. It's kind of the only way someone is going to do something with me these days. It definitely feels like the ""right one"" doesn't exist m, you know?

  It could be a couple of different things. It could be something as simple as you calling him a man while talking, or wearing his clothes. Especially being clingy in the right. I guess you won't know for sure until you ask him yourself.

  "
443678,"
   If we want growth, why do we recoil from constructive criticisms?
  ","
  It challenges our sense of value. Criticism implies judgment and we all recoil from feeling judged.... If we're feeling threatened or diminished by another person's perceived shortcomings, providing “constructive criticism” becomes secondary to getting our value back.

  You have to grieve your relationship. Recognize that everything you're feeling is normal and over time the pain will go away.
  "
443729,"
   In your opinion, what is the worst emotion? Why?
  ","
  Depression and anger.
  
  Anger can lead to very dangerous things if not controlled and it's very damaging for your health.
  
  Depression is more dangerous because if not treated, you will be lead down an extremely dark path that not everyone can get our of. You lose brainpower,  become over or underweight. Suicidal ideation, self-arm, and at higher risk for heart attacks. It weakens your immune system and can lead to substance abuse.
  "
443730,"
   But on a serious note:
  ","
  Why do adults try to say marriage sucks and that it's not worth it? It's not my fault you're purposely damaging it by not communicating, listening or putting in the effort. Of course marriage is difficult. Everything that is worth it is. If you're both putting in the work, then your marriage could be a beautiful thing. It's when you stop, it becomes messy and hard to deal with.

  Life has taught me a lot about mental health and how important it is to put it first. Stop putting others first and realize that your needs are more important. Peoples opinions of you are meaningless, especially a strangers. Spread kindness no matter what mood you are in. Nobody on this planet owes you anything. Be teachable and open-minded. Never assume somebody's life is perfect just because you only see the outside. Time is on your side, especially for healing.

  I don't know why, but today I am really missing being in a relationship. I miss having someone I can spoil, care for and genuinely love. I miss going to bed with someone next to me and waking up in the morning to them, only to cook them breakfast. I miss randomly dancing around the house, especially with that person wearing nothing but my button up t-shirt because we feel like it. I miss being able to go to the coffee shop, walking to the back where they have a stack of old books only for a certain one to catch your eye and you pick it up only to read your favorite chapter to me. You don't know it, but in that moment I am truly, deeply, admiring you. I miss being able to take you to our favorite spots only to spend hours on end talking about anything and everything. I miss the sound of your voice, the way you smile and laugh at random childhood moments or when I say something dumb. I miss holding you in my arms because in those moments that's where I feel the safest. And I miss walking you home late at night to make sure you arrive safely and giving you a kiss goodnight. I miss all the spontaneous adventures we'd have and you turning back into a kid again as I capture all the moments with my polaroid because I'm a dork and love seeing you at your happiest. But honestly.... I just really miss you....

  Use guidlines to balance your shot, make sure your camera is on focus and then focus on one subject. It's very important to take lots of pictures at different angles. Mess around with the filters too. Embrace negative space which refers to the areas around or between the subject. Play with reflections. Look for symmetry and repetitive patterns. Capture small details and use natural light. You can mess around with color block if you'd like. Use flash only during the day and consider buying a tripod.

  1. Surround yourself with people who love and encourage you. Let them remind you just how amazing you are.
  
  2. Step outside of your comfort zone and try something new.
  
  3. Embrace and love the things that make you different.
  
  4. Realize that beauty cannot be defined.
  
  5. Stop comparing yourself. YOU are beautiful EXACTLY just the way you are.
  
  6. Follow your passion. You know that thing that gets you so excited but scares you at the same time. The thing you really want to do but have convinced yourself it won’t work. You should go do that!
  
  7. Forgive yourself.
  
  8. Don't forget to allow yourself to be human.
  
  9. Be patient but persistent. Self-love is ever evolving. It’s something that needs to be practiced daily but can take a lifetime to master. So be kind and support yourself through the hard times.
  
  10. Be mindful of what you think, feel and want.
  
  11. The next time you are feeling happy and on top of the world make a list of your best qualities and accomplishments.

People don't realize how alone I actually am and I spend 98% of my time being alone in my room. I don't do much with my life. I'm a very lonely person. I have abandonment issues. I struggle with intimacy. I have a lot I have yet to work on, but I've come a long ways from where I used to be.

  Self-love was never meant to replace romantic love. Stop telling people to “love themselves” when they talk about wanting a significant other. Both are supposed to coexist. Wanting a partner doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t love yourself.

  By setting boundaries and sticking to them. Realize the fact that it's unhealthy to hang out and talk 24/7. You need your space from each other. Your life does not revolve around them. Let yourself breathe. Learn to say no to your partner and stand up for yourself if they try guilt tripping you.

  My anxiety has it's moments but it's mainly because something triggers it. It doesn't happen very often. I'm quite stable nowadays and can enjoy my life. My mind has quieted down a lot so I don't overthink often. I do take antidepressants but I haven't taken mine in a week and I'm completely fine.

  I did have to grow up fast in certain ways. I think it's my fault that I feel the need to parent everyone and take care of them. Then again, that's how I've been treated from a young age. People used to ask for my advice all the time and expected me to crack the whip with them. It's weird because some people genuinely thought of me as like a parent figure and that I 'raised' them when I never did. I don't know.... it's all weird. With certain people I do feel the need to act more mature than I am because of the age group I surround myself by. I want people to take me seriously, I know that I'm young so I have to prove that I'm worth it and deserve it.

   why are you against moving in with your girlfriend or boyfriend?
  ","
  Because I take these things seriously and I feel like most people nowadays don't. If we aren't in a serious relationship and engaged, then don't ask me to move in with you. I'm not comfortable with it. I don't want us getting into a bad break up and me having to get my stuff. It's just awkward. And don't give me that crap about wanting to see if we'll work out as a married couple because sweetie, we aren't married. That's a whole different level.
  "
444273,"
   What do men really want in a relationship?
  ","
  Every guy is different and I can only speak for myself.
  
  What I want, is emotional intimacy, respect, some praise here and there and acceptance. A physical connection, some romance, security, emotional maturity, communication, partnership, some fun, and some space when needed. A connection, someone who is patient, someone who isn't afraid to be different and doesn't want to fit in with the rest of the world. I like independent woman, one who is honest and caring. A woman who knows how to compliment me on my personality and not just my looks. It makes me feel better about myself when one does so. Don't be afraid to be the boss and have your way with me. I have no problem with being submissive towards you. Please.... PLEASE don't hide your feelings from me or brush it off. I know I act like a therapist, but it's because I want to help and I don't like seeing you upset. Please... PLEASE know I AM THERE FOR YOU! Someone who isn't going to point out all my wrongs and lets me fix them. I'm not perfect, but please know that I am trying my best.

   This is a weird question. Were you excited when you found you were going to be a father for the first time? Hoe did it differ from the second time you found you were going to be a father again?
  ","
  Not exactly. I was very disgusted, ashamed and angry with myself. I had a lot of mixed emotions because her mother r-p-d me and that's how she was conceived.
  
  When I found out I was Amariah's dad, my family gave me no choice but to put her up for adoption. They told me I wouldn't make a good father because I couldn't take care of myself due to the situation I was in at that time. Her mother didn't want her, but was going to give her full custody to me when she was born. Obviously, that didn't happen as I was forced to give her up. It's something I regret and I wish I fought for her. There's more that i love than being a father and i am so grateful that her adopted family is so understanding and allows me to be apart of her life.
  
  With Gabbie, it was different because I was in love. I was engaged to her and we were starting a family together. It was everything I (we) wanted. When she told me she was pregnant, I was SO BEYOND EXCITED! I was crying, I was speechless, I was smiling so hard my cheeks hurt.
  
  It was perfect. It's still perfect and I can't wait for our little man to be here.

Once the matter is resolved, they forgive and forget. Be together for the right reasons. Good communication and respect. Talk openly about everything, especially what hurts. Give your partner the space they need. Be forgiving and understanding. You have to realize that little things add up to big things. Set boundaries with your partner and respect it. Ride the waves babe. A good/healthy relationship takes a lot of work. Be respectful, honest and listen to your partner. There are so many things that make a relationship successful and loving.

   Reflection.  ?
  ","
  This year.... I don't know where to begin? I had hit rock bottom with my mental health. I almost took my life several times and it had truly broken me. My strength was tested in so many different ways. I cannot tell you how exhausting this year has been for me, but it definitely has been. I truly believed that this year was going to be my last, but thankfully, I had people who wasn't going to give up on me and stuck by my side. Made sure I had everything I needed to stay alive. Put me through not just therapy, but intensive therapy where I learnt so much and am still learning so much from going through that. I truly believed that it was impossible to be where I am today at that time in my life. It's been quite the journey. I am still learning how to accept so much in my life. I'm learning so much about myself now that my eyes are open. I am no longer blind to not just the outside world, but most importantly, myself. Thank God for self awareness and figuring out boundaries. It's felt so weird to finally be stable and no longer being on such an extreme high and low 24/7. It's been interesting to have such a peaceful mind, I tell ya. But i want to thank everyone who has stuck by my side this year. I know it was not easy for you either, but i am SO THANKFUL and GRATEFUL for you all! ?

444416,"
   Why are you really single?
  ","
  Cause I have a fear of intimacy due to my past and having a lot of negative experiences with it. Definitely doesn't help and it's hard for me to accept the fact that good things can happen to me. A positive experience isn't something I experience very often so it's easy for me to react in a negative way instead of accepting the fact that it's a good thing. I self sabotage sadly.... it's something I'm working on in therapy.

   8 Life Lessons
  ","
  1. Let go of anger. When we erupt in anger we often feel much worse. Hence, it’s better to cool off and to work on staying calm.
  
  2. When people treat you badly it’s rarely about you. More often it tells you how that person is feeling, or some other issues that are bothering them.
  
  3. You’re not the only one who has struggled with this issue – so don’t feel so awful, or put yourself down.
  
  4. Enjoy the good times, and savour every moment as life is a precious gift to be enjoyed.
  
  5. Work and be persistent as it’s worth the slog and pain. In the end it makes a difference as the pay off is success.
  
  6. You need to find a passion and set yourself some goals if you want to go somewhere, and makes something of life.
  
  7. Relationships can teach us so much about ourselves. Both the good and the bad can show us who we really are. They reveal what we think, and how we feel, about ourselves – as well as what our values and our expectations are.
  
  8. Don’t put off to tomorrow what you could do today. You’ll achieve so much more if you push full steam ahead. And easing off too much sows the seeds of laziness. You’ll have much more self respect if you achieve more than you’d planned.

I don't like that I'm being put in the middle of this. It makes me shut down mentally and emotionally.

  When you've suffered with mental health for so long and am use those extreme highs and lows, it can feel extremely weird when you're finally stable enough to live your life and enjoy it. I don't remember the last time I was mentally stable and now that I am, it's been quite a journey. I have to retrain my brain of my own thoughts and emotions. Make myself realize that what I am feeling now is completely normal and not to become suddenly overwhelmed by not knowing if what I am feeling is normal or not. I am self-aware nowadays which is a good thing but I find myself filled with a lot of questions and trying to sort out my emotions and thoughts. To realize that a bad day is just a bad day nowadays and it's okay to not be okay for a day or two is still a struggle I have. Especially when I feel depressed. It scares me the most along side with my anxiety. Yesterday I had a day full of meetings, after my meetings, I had therapy. On my way to therapy I was anxious and shaking. It was my abusers birthday and a lot of others things were going on previously and I almost got hit by a semi. Once I arrived at the clinic, checked myself in and checked myself in again and got my clip board, I could barely even rate my emotions because my hands where shaking so much. It took me 15 mins of my session to finally chill out. Relaxing and using breathing techniques are one of my BIGGEST struggle.

  Truth is, we all wear capes in the real world. We all pretend to some degree. We're taught to lie about certain things yet we were born to tell the truth. Our truth comes out in many different forms. Some in a healthy way, others do it on their arms. Either way, our capes are always being warn. It's time to remove them and move on. Show the real you. Tell the real truth because it's meant to be heard. It's time for you to know that you're not alone.  You are not weak for admitting that you need help. You are not crazy for the way your mental illness makes you think and feel. You are human being just like everyone else and you are just as important as the rest of us.

   Why are bad habits hard to break?
  ","
  Learned from others.. need to reprogram yourself. Not ready to get rid of certain things. Coping mechanism. Lie to yourself about them being ""bad"" when they know that those things are bad and don't help the person. Temporary habits don't keep you in the mood forever.

  Communication, trust, honesty, having fun times together, less drama, s*x, emotions shared, knowing eachother a lot, I  don't care for screaming.. lots of other things go into it.

  Can't always blame parents for everything especially when an adult. Learn from their mistakes, learn from your own. Take responsibility for your own actions.
