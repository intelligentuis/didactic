facebook .","281270":"if i wanted to include those questions in my answer , i would have . lol .","281271":"having humorous conversations with friends makes me smile . i m serious most of the time , so it s nice to have a funny chat with my friends every now and again . they re the only people who can really make me laugh .","281272":"yes , there are a few questions i d like to ask people , but i haven t . sometimes you re better off not knowing certain things .","281273":"just the ins and outs of day to day life . not every day is a challenge , but some days are and i ve been trying to focus on the present instead of the future or the past .","281274":"food , water , shelter , clothing , and sleep .","281275":"hello do you have a question ?","281276":"? ? ? anyway , i finished writing the creative essay i was working on all afternoon i m pretty proud of it .","281277":"nah , it took me maybe minutes , lol . all i did was a neutral eye shadow , mascara , foundation , concealer , bronzer , highlight , and a neutral lip color .","281278":"there are a lot more important things to worry about than whether or not someone is using slang or made a spelling error or isn t very good at writing grammar etc . speaking of which , i m writing creatively for the first time in quite a few months right now .","281279":"precisely . i m glad i grew out of that omg your spelling and grammar must be immaculate stage . then again , i was a teenager when i thought that , lmaoo .","281280":"haha , yeah it is rather classist . also , it s just the internet it s not as if you re writing a dissertation or something . language is constantly evolving , at any rate , and there will always be new slang words congruent with time .","281281":"i don t trust politicians , but i do trust medical professionals .","281282":"i can t force you to believe me . but i suggest you do further research and listen to the cdc .","281283":"sitting outside with an iced coffee , listening to music , and sharing stories with friends .","281284":"i believe the protesters are irresponsible and don t see the big picture especially if they re claiming the coronavirus is fake . tens of thousands of people have died from it , and chances are those protesters haven t had personal experience with it at all . it s ignorance .","281285":"depends on my mood . usually my roommate and i cook , but we also order takeout if we re both exhausted or are running low on food .","281286":"no , not really .","281287":"i don t even know when celinem is online , and it s normal for people s opinions and behavior to change as they get older . perhaps in the past , i didn t like using regular slang terms , but these days i really don t care anymore . i also used to think that people should be grammatically correct on the internet at all times years ago i don t hold those same views anymore , obviously .","281288":"? ? ? on multiple occasions , you guys have seen me use words like fam and my dude . i use those slang terms all the time , lol . the ones i don t use are phrases like what s poppin ? or what s good ? and things of that nature . celinem is my friend and we re allowed to have differing opinions . not everything is as deep as you perceive it to be , lol .","281289":"i actually did my makeup last night for the first time in over a month","281290":"forensic psychology , criminology , anthropology , sociology . . . the list goes on and on . i took some beginner classes in these subjects when i was in college as electives , but because they weren t related to my major at all , i couldn t really go further with them .","281291":"all of my years have blended together , so i don t really know which age was the best for me or which age i would rather stay in forever . i would say probably sometime in my early s , because everything else seemed to go downhill from there . lmaoo .","281292":"i more often give advice than look for advice , but i wouldn t really consider myself motherly or protective . i know that people will make their decisions regardless of what is told to them , and some people will take that advice into account and some won t , but it s ultimately their decision and it s no use trying to protect them from their own mistakes . people will make mistakes , and will often learn from those mistakes . sometimes we have to make mistakes in order to move forward . i m not going to sit here and try to protect my friends from those mistakes , but i ll give them my input and then they can decide whether or not they will take it .","281293":"grilled chicken , steamed broccoli , and jasmine rice .","281294":"i ve always loved spinach and mushrooms salads , as well as ceasar salads with a small amount of dressing . i used to eat chicken cobb salads a few years ago , but i found that they weren t exactly the healthiest for you considering the abundance of ingredients .","281295":"i don t really have an opinion , because people are much more complex than what their religious beliefs are and they re more than just a religious follower . they aren t defined by their religion .","281296":"i only know of achievement hunter i ve never heard of neebs gaming before . however , in terms of ah , i think i d be the most like gavin because i m terrible at most games and i find myself in the most ridiculous scenarios , lmaoo . example i was tipsy and playing gta v with my ex and our friends , and we entered a helicopter . we play on xbox one . to enter and exit vehicles , you have to press y . so while we re like . . . feet in the air , my friend tells me , hey leigh , you can mount your gun if you press y . so i go , oh , okay ! i press y and my character jumps right out of the helicopter and fall to their death . lmaoo .","281297":"when i go to the store or , i seldom get carded so i suppose i look older than , at the very least . people usually think i look younger than what i actually am .","281298":"nah , i seldom drink soda because i don t like the taste of most sodas , and also because the sugar in them is unbelievable and the zero sugar ones taste horrible .","281299":"i d get a small rose twisting around my cheekbone and eyebrow .","281300":"i don t have any photos from my childhood .","281301":"i actually tried archery when i was upstate new york when my friends and i took a weekend vacation together . it was definitely fun , but i was terrible .","281302":"you should probably consult jim jones or charles manson .","281303":"no , i just finished eating breakfast .","281304":"i m self conscious , and i also don t have the right equipment for streaming or recording videos . i think i would be more comfortable if i played in a group , like my friends when we play together , but those times are seldom these days .","281305":"lol , yes that has happened to me on a few occasions , particularly in recent times considering i drink most nights out of the week at this point . cutting alcohol out of your intake will definitely decrease your tolerance level , so if you want your tolerance to lessen , i would suggest either cutting down severely or stopping altogether .","281306":"i wouldn t choose any , lol . i don t have any desire to be famous , whether irl or online .","281307":"i ve always wanted to set up a gaming channel , where i d record videos of my playing different video games with my camera and mic , and then upload them to youtube .","281308":"money is probably the most obvious answer . it would solve a lot of my problems and get rid of my debt .","281309":"taco bell ? lmaoo . i usually order a veggie power bowl , cheese quesadilla , and cheesy gordita crunch . i can t eat all of that in one sitting , though . i also used to love their nacho fries .","281310":"as far as i m comfortable going , i suppose . it depends on the question .","281311":"no , that would have had no effect on our relationship .","281312":"i m not sure what this means , but regardless , i answer questions that are asked to me and i reply assuming they re not troll questions or inappropriate .","281313":"i don t believe so , no .","281314":"i thought about it in the past , but it s probably not going to happen . i m already in a lot of debt from school , and i don t want to add more to it . i also don t even know what i would want to study , my interests are in a broad range of topics .","281315":"it could be either . i try not to think about it too much .","281316":"yeah , there s nobody else i m interested in at the moment .","281317":"it s slang , obviously . god forbid i m not grammatically correct of the time , lol .","281318":"lol . it s not something i can just snap my fingers and do . it takes time .","281319":"to a certain degree , i believe i still am . sigh .","281320":"i ll just be saving it , although it s not like i ll be transferring that money into my savings account or anything . i ll just accrue money like usual without

! !","281323":"i paid off the remaining balance on my car today . i m so excite .","281324":"i don t place much faith in zodiac signs , because someone s personality is dependent upon their environment , how they grew up , their interests , etc etc . it doesn t necessarily correlate with their zodiac sign , so to judge someone based on what sign they are is ignorant , in my opinion .","281325":"my parents are vastly different people , and i m more similar to my father than anything else . we re both hard working , logical to a point , and look at situations from multiple perspectives before making a decision . my mother , on the other hand , is narcissistic , selfish , and impulsive . she doesn t think before she speaks or acts , which has often led to hurt feelings . she never admits when she s wrong and she only sees things from her own perspective .","281326":"this is similar to my previous response , so please refer to that answer for what being in love with someone can encompass . having a crush on someone doesn t mean that you love them or even in love with them . it s just an infatuation with a person with feelings that may not necessarily be very strong .","281327":"you can love someone without being in love with them and it isn t necessarily romantic . you can love your friends , your family , your colleagues , your pets , etc etc . being in love with someone , on the other hand , normally happens when you re with a partner and the feelings of love you have are unlike anything else . it s different for everyone , but you ll feel a distinct difference between simply loving someone and then being in love with someone .","281328":"haha , aw . i m thankful that i still have a job amid this crisis , but having weekends is always nice .","281329":"i m doing well only . more hours of work to go , then it s the weekend ! !","281330":"i like appetizers , lol . veggies dip , pretzels and guacamole , chips and salsa , spinach artichoke dip , mozzerella sticks , and potato skins are some of my favorites .","281331":"the chemical composition of dopamine , oxytocin , serotonin , and endorphins .","281332":"i d choose metal out of those three presented , although grunge is good too .","281333":"i started an accidental collection of mugs while i was living in my parents house . i don t remember how many i had , but it was probably in excess of mugs . ever since i moved , i drastically decreased the number of mugs i own and i maybe have or at this point .","281334":"haha , i pour them into a bowl . i d like to have a serving size instead of accidentally eating the entire bag in one sitting .","281335":"my ex , my ex s best friend , my roommate , and two of my close friends .","281336":"hello do you have a question ?","281337":"new vape .","281338":"no , i don t have schizophrenia .","281339":"i ve never actually watched him before , lol . i think i ve seen snippets of things here and there , but i haven t watched enough to really form an opinion on the man .","281340":"i don t like his newer comedies , but the waterboy and the wedding singer are both fantastic movies .","281341":"i don t usually eat at mcdonalds , but i ll normally just order their fries and maybe chicken nuggets . their coffee is really good , though .","281342":"i ve honestly never heard of it before , so i don t have an opinion .","281343":"yeah , i ve been wearing prescription lenses since i was young .","281344":"i prefer regular popcorn with butter , but cheddar cheese popcorn is also good .","281345":"arrogance , discriminatory viewpoints , dishonesty , disrespect , and manipulative behavior .","281346":"taco bell , lmaoo .","281347":"i have seven tattoos .","281348":"thanks , my dude","281349":"no , not particularly . spiders freak me out a bit if they re too large , though .","281350":"i guess piranhas ? lmaoo . i ve never seen one in the wild before , just at the aquarium .","281351":"it depends on the state some places are worse than others . in new york , we re still under lockdown and places will begin opening up slowly starting tomorrow . i honestly still think it s premature , but we ll see what happens .","281352":"nope . i ve just been working , and primarily spending my time watching television and playing video games . i ve been meaning to get back into writing creatively , but i haven t had the motivation .","281353":"whenever someone feels like it . shaving should be a personal choice and not an obligation .","281354":"i have no intentions of meeting strangers from askfm .","281355":"my first car was a navy blue volkswagen cabrio ! !","281356":"yeah , this is often the case with me . i ve never had any indication that i m anyone s favorite person to talk to , for example , and i saw this post on facebook that was like , it sucks being the friend who takes candid photos of all of your friends when you re hanging out to show your love , but no one ever does the same for you . it hit me hard because that s always the case with me . i m always the person taking photos and videos , no one else ever thinks about it .","281357":"uh , i m not a girl and most definitely not a baby . lmaoo .","281358":"maybe ? i don t really think so , though . i ve always had these types of mood swings , and while they ve definitely gotten worse since the breakup , i don t think it s the direct cause behind why i feel so sh tty tonight . sometimes it just happens .","281359":"not really , i was hanging out with my roommate for a bit before he went to bed . sometimes at night , i just get this overwhelming sense of despair and hopelessness that seemingly crops up out of nowhere . the sensation that things are pointless and meaningless appear again , and i m left with the debate of either staying awake to prolong the day so that i don t have to deal with tomorrow , or going to bed and tomorrow coming quicker .","281360":"yeah , i ve been good at spelling since i was a child .","281361":"not usually , no .","281362":"it was an all right day . i didn t really do much except work , then i just hung around and played with the cats and watched television . i m feeling a bit down tonight for whatever reason , so i m debating on either staying up drinking or going to bed early .","281363":"salmon .","281364":"no , not particularly .","281365":"kitty toe beans .","281366":"i definitely agree . if we open prematurely , there s going to be an inevitable second wave of the virus , which may or may not be worse than this first wave .","281367":"depends on the reason why i dislike them , i suppose . i don t dislike many people at all , so honestly this is an unrealistic scenario anyway .","281368":"wow , that s wild . then again , it all depends on how severe the cases are in everyone s area . new york , and long island specifically , has been hit the hardest it appears . we re supposed to start re opening businesses on friday , but i also haven t heard any new or developing information about that date in a while . i don t know what the ultimate plan is .","281369":"it s for the best , tbh . beauty supply stores are not essential businesses and should not be open until everything is safe for things to begin opening again .","281370":"he s kind , otherwise i wouldn t have dated him in the first place . he put me first in most circumstances unless the situation called for something where he needed to look after his own well being first , especially when it came to his health .","281371":"empathy , in a way . i can understand people extremely well and i m always available to help other people should they need advice or a shoulder to cry on . on the other hand , my empathy is just another one of my strong emotions that can be too strong at times , and i ll often invest my time and heart into someone or something without getting anything in return .","281372":"i agree to a certain extent , but it really depends on my mood . i haven t colored my hair a red tone in a few years , which is why i m planning on returning to it once things get back to normal .","281373":"it doesn t sound like i m the one who s butthurt . i m pointing out how amusing it is , lol .","281374":"he s a hard working person who has always been dedicated to whatever he sets his mind on , and he s diligent in his work ethic . he has a dark sense of humor , and people either love him or hate him . he s blunt , honest , and has a strong aura , as well as a no nonsense attitude . as for morals , him and i are similar in that we both have the concept of what right versus wrong is , but we have a skewed perception of how we approach morality and basically do what we think is right instead of what may be universally right . it s one of the things we ve always been able to relate on .","281375":"i find it hilarious how y all have such strong opinions on a hair color . lmaoo .","281376":"i m not sure how this is relevant . i m not morgan , lol . cc dieselmom","281377":"when it comes to hair color , yeah . generally speaking , it s healthier for your hair to purchase a product from a brand that specializes in that specific area . those brands won t use harsh chemicals that will damage your hair .","281378":"he believes in equal rights , but he s never described himself as a feminist . he isn t the type of person to label himself with anything .","281379":"any type of drug store box dye is horrible for your hair . all professional colorists and hair stylists recommend against using them .","281380":"yeah , but sally s is closed until further notice at least in new york .","281381":"l oreal is horrible , lol . i d recommend searching online for brands like overtone , arctic fox , and manic panic .","281382":"i ve only colored my hair at home on a few occasions , when my hair was much shorter . and it was still a pain in the ass because i was terrified that i missed spots . but , if you have someone to help you do the back of your head , you should be okay . just use a reputable hair color brand instead of the box dye you d buy at the drug store , those are horrible for you .","281383":"no , my natural hair color is a dull , mousy brown it s often referred to as dirty blonde but it s more brown than blonde .","281384":"lmaooo . no , we broke up for mature reasons . contrary to your belief , farting is something everyone does and there s no shame in farting in front of your partner or close friends . it s actually pretty humorous .","281385":"funnily enough , the blonde wasn t even intentional . i ve only purposely colored my hair blonde on one occasion over years ago .","281386":"swimming , most definitely . i do like to swim on occasion , and i feel very natural in the water . skydiving seems way too daunting and terrifying for me , lol .","281387":"i don t trust people right off the bat to begin with anyway . but someone changing their username isn t an indication of whether or not they can be trusted . their behavior towards you others is a primary indication .","281388":"destiny ! ! i was trying to level up because you can t really do much until you reach level i think i m at level rn .","281389":"definitely not . lmaoo . i used to translate answer questions that were asked to me in other languages , but i don t have the patience for that anymore .","281390":"y all should ask me questions","281391":"my best friend and or my ex .","281392":"i reassured my roommate and gave him advice on some events that are currently happening which are affecting his relationship . i basically told him that as long and he and his girlfriend are honest and have open communication with each other , they can make it work regardless of what the outcome of this situation is .","281393":"write a legal argument using social security regulations and lexisnexis , proving that a person is legally disabled .","281394":"sometimes , yeah . in the past , i ve watched bojack horseman , bob s burgers , american dad , big mouth , and rick morty . also , do adventure time and regular show count ? lol .","281395":"it has mike shinoda s face on it , lol . my supervisor bought it for me two christmases ago . she found an etsy shop that customizes jesus candles and you can put any face on it . so at the time , i was obsessed with mike shinoda s new album so she ordered one for me .","281396":"hello ! ! this chonk is my new bff","281397":"thank you my natural hair color is a dull , mousy brown tone some call it dirty blonde . i ve never liked it which is why i started coloring my hair from a very young age .","281398":"i used to have a collection of mugs while living at my parents house , but i got rid of most of them when i moved . now i only own around mugs . this is my favorite","281399":"haha , aw thank you ! ! i m personally not the biggest fan of having blonde hair , but i was curious . my next hair color is going to be a dark brown with red balayage

never backed biden from my knowledge , i ve always been a fan of bernie sanders .","281412":"i believe one of my final papers during my senior year of college was between pages long . it was somewhat of a thesis , but i honestly can t even recall what the topic was . i ve always enjoyed writing so it didn t take much for me to complete it , and i procrastinated so i got it written in a very short period of time . i like writing and researching , so it came easily to me .","281413":"honestly , i m not entirely sure . it could go either way at this point .","281414":"it s an app where you can

gameboy prior to that . they re some of my favorite games and i m so excited that they re remaking them with the original maps and soundtrack .","281417":"i used to when i wore my fitbit , and i honestly don t remember what the highest number was . i once walked blocks downtown from penn station to a comedy club in manhattan , and then back up to penn station when the show was over , instead of taking a taxi . my friend insisted on walking , so we walked . looking it up on google , apparently it was only . miles each way . but it felt so much longer than that , lmaoo .","281418":"for a quick and easy protein packed breakfast , instead of cooking eggs on the stove , you can crack two eggs into a mug with a splash of milk and some salt , and then microwave for seconds . the eggs come out scrambled and ready to eat , and they taste just as delicious cooked as if you cooked them on the stove . it saves a lot of cooking time and things you need to wash later on .","281419":"the usa is filled with civil injustice , hypocrisy , political divide , sexism , and racism , among other forms of oppression . people may see it as the mecca of the free world , but in reality , there is so much oppression and restriction against people of color , other races , those who are gay or trans , the disabled , etc etc . the economic system is plummeting as well . many other countries view the usa as a joke at this point .","281420":"i highly disagree . ups downs of relationships include stuff like getting into arguments , enduring hardship together , etc etc . cheating is a choice and in the majority of situations , there s absolutely no excuse for it at all . if your partner is cheating on you , then there s no reason for you to stay together in most circumstances , although i known some have differing opinions . everyone deserves the respect of loyalty , and if your partner doesn t respect you , the relationship is built on nothing .","281421":"lol , i believe so , yes . despite all of the chaos has brought us thus far , the year has also brought us creative and hilarious memes as a method of all of us coping with what has been happening .","281422":"captain morgan rum , or

most definitely hurt you if you re around the wrong people . it s extremely common , though , and i m also one of those people who panic when people are angry with me or if i perceive them to be mad , so i ll apologize profusely for things that aren t necessarily my fault .","281434":"i don t know your partner , so i can t tell you whether or not they d take advantage of that . ideally , they wouldn t and they would help you work through your insecurities . they would reassure you that you have nothing to apologize for and help you see your own worth .","281435":"it s comforting , i guess ? i also have a short attention span so i don t feel as bad if i lose focus , because i already somewhat know what i missed and i don t have to rewind to watch it again . new shows are daunting to me

want to buy .","281451":"here are all of my tattoos","281452":"damn cat just discovered the shower is obsessed with chasing water down the drain , lmaoo .","281453":"i never finished the book , but i believe the fireman by joe hill would be a fantastic movie . joe hill is stephen king s son , and he s just as brilliant of a writer as his father .","281454":"yes , most definitely . there have been several people in my life who turned out to be toxic to me , and although i did eventually cut them out of my life and move on , they still encouraged me to go down a darker path that was detrimental to my health .","281455":"i m sure it s happened on multiple occasions , but i can t recall any specific incidents .","281456":"hello everything is fine , thanks for asking . i m currently on my lunch break at work . i m super excited because apparently tony hawk pro skater are being remade , and they re coming out in september ! ! those were my sh t back in the day , i can t wait .","281457":"i believe regardless of gender , a person may be attracted to someone who s expressed that they ve experienced hardship because they have a caring nature and want to help them . some people also seem to go a little further and want to save them , which can be a borderline toxic situation . on the other hand , some others are just naturally drawn to people who have had significant hardship on an innate level , because they can understand them in a unique way .","281458":"i m actually a huge fan of the new design ! ! i m a sucker for sans serif fonts , and the elongated font design is something that brings me great enjoyment for the time being . i also think the re design of our profile pages is very aesthetically pleasing .","281459":"it s fine . honestly , i probably deleted them because i thought they were terrible .","281460":"i cleared out my photos , at least the ones i didn t want to keep , prior to transferring the data to the new phone . i literally just remembered that i have an album dedicated to old phone photos , but none of my paintings are there , lmaoo . apparently i need more coffee . sigh .","281461":"i m doing well , just a bit bored at work because i stupidly did a lot of work yesterday left nearly nothing for myself to finish today . i m trying to keep busy by creating tasks for myself , but also my inboxes are very dry so it s been difficult . i ve only gotten a few emails in the last three hours .","281462":"i heard the same thing , lol . my roommate was like , hey . . . come look out the front door it was downpouring with huge flakes , lmaoo .","281463":"i agree with you ! ! i also like the font change , and the profile itself looks much cleaner and more professional .","281464":"chilly , but surprisingly sunny ! ! which is a nice change considering i feel like it s been gray for the past few weeks . did you see that random snowfall the other day ? that was absolutely wild . degrees in the middle of may , and there was so much snow coming down .","281465":"crab legs and lobster tail .","281466":"my brother and i get along , but we re not too close to begin with .","281467":"i wouldn t know , i ve never babysat anyone before .","281468":"uh , because i forgot ? lmaoo . i ve had this new phone since september , so my old phone is of no use to me .","281469":"no , i don t know where my old phone is .","281470":"i m not aware of it . i haven t been following politics lately .","281471":"i can be at times , but usually no . i value my alone time a lot , and while there are some people who i wouldn t mind talking to all the time , i also know that it s unrealistic and unfair to expect a person to respond to you .","281472":"i like answering interesting questions also educating and helping people with matters related to mental health , relationships , education , career choices , etc etc .","281473":"girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . the shining by stephen king . interview with the vampire by anne rice . american psycho by bret easton ellis . the gargoyle by andrew davidson . the secret history by donna tartt .","281474":"because i m mentally ill and a symptom of my illnesses is extreme mood swings .","281475":"of course , although i m much more apt to feel negative emotions .","281476":"every emotion has the capability of bringing me to tears , lmaoo .","281477":"threatening to m rder someone .","281478":"lol , i m probably the worst person to ask this question to because i m controlled by my emotions , especially if i m talking about emotions or a sensitive topic with a friend . if you want to remain objective , then perhaps try placing yourself in their shoes and see the situation from different perspectives , instead of basing it off of your experiences alone . take your friend s feelings into consideration and focus your attention on how they feel instead of empathizing based on how it makes you feel .","281479":"nothing interests me these days all i want to do is drink and sleep .","281480":"i m surviving .","281481":"starting to prefer the way i look in glasses these days .","281482":"i wash them every week .","281483":"i don t have any photos , haha . all of my paintings were saved on my old phone .","281484":"yes , i m very much interested in photography .","281485":"not very well , haha . i either drink or smoke , and i also distract myself through television and video games . occasionally when i m feeling up to it , i ll vent to friends about what s stressing me out .","281486":"disgusting , lmaoo . i m wearing leggings and an oversized tee shirt and hoodie . i also haven t washed my hair in like four days , so it s greasy .","281487":"when i m in the mood for it , i mainly paint , use pastels , or do charcoal drawings .","281488":"the bahamas ! !","281489":"serotonin , dopamine , and endorphins .","281490":"my birthday is november th . i don t care very much about my birthday , tbh . it s just another average day in my eyes . i don t usually do anything special .","281491":"i learned a few new things , but nothing i would feel comfortable posting on askfm .","281492":"i m against the death penalty .","281493":"yeah , going on walks through the park during the autumn is really nice and helps me reconnect with nature .","281494":"i prefer the spring over the summer . it gets way too hot humid during the summer where i live .","281495":"i m creative in writing , art , and photography .","281496":"i think i ve posted these before , so .","281497":"saturday afternoon . i had to run a few errands for my mother .","281498":"friday night my friend and i , with whom i ve known since high school , did a zoom call together for about an hour . we used to hang out on a regular basis .","281499":"i m doing all right , although i m exhausted . my friend was s icidal last night and threatening to overdose , so i stayed awake for hours talking them down and reassuring them and calming them down . their messages were more coherent the more i talked to them finally they said they re tired and going to bed , and when i checked up on them this morning , they seemed pretty okay . i m so tired , though . stuff like this is so emotionally draining for me but i m happy that they re all right .","281500":"if those things are crossing boundaries , then no . even if you love them , you also have to respect yourself and your own boundaries and well being . saying no to your loved one isn t bad , and if they take your refusal to do something as a bad thing , then they re not the right person for you .","281501":"it s hard to distinguish just one thing because everything sorta blends into each other to create this chaotic mess , honestly . between the mood swings and paranoia , the deep depressions and mania , and the unhealthy coping mechanisms and obsessive attachments . . . it all becomes hard to deal with because they re all happening at the same time .","281502":"i would keep it to myself , tbh . i know that if i told people , i would probably be institutionalized because i have a history of mental illness and it would likely be classified as a delusion or hallucination , especially because people with bpd can sometimes experience psychosis .","281503":"on youtube , the third last song i listened to was make it up as i go by mike shinoda and k . flay . https youtu . be mahif xlpu","281504":"i don t have music saved on my phone , so i can t do this , haha .","281505":"it was pm five hours ago . . . i don t remember what i was doing , lmao . probably just laying down and watching television .","281506":"by choice , unfortunately . i don t think i have an eating disorder exactly , but i ve always struggled with disordered eating habits and they come out in full force when i m under stress or feeling mentally unwell .","281507":"i only use one certain kind , but it s a charcoal mud mask that i found on amazon last year . i don t remember the name of it . it really gets all of the grime off my skin , closes my pores , and makes me feel smooth and refreshed .","281508":"worst habits drinking alcohol . smoking well , vaping now . lately , food restriction . best habits venting to friends when i m down . productive outlets to frustration , i . e . video games and writing . sleeping a lot ?","281509":"thank you ! ! i actually just did a face mask , so it looks much better at the moment than it did earlier today .","281510":"lee has always been my name since i was a teenager , and as i ve gotten older , it seemed more and more juvenile and immature to me . i stumbled across the name leigh quite a number of years ago and felt it suited me better , so i started going by leigh in my adult years instead .","281511":"i break out more as an adult than i did as a teenager , haha . this is what my skin looks like right now i have a few blemishes on my cheek that you can t really see and a big mark on my forehead .","281512":"eeeyyy , someone ask me some questions anything trollish or inappropriate will be promptly deleted .","281513":"i usually get a large iced coffee from dunkin , or a trenta iced coffee from starbucks .","281514":"they re probably about the same difficulty , although french came pretty easy to me when i first learned it as a teenager . looking back , i wish i would have chosen spanish to learn instead because i would have gotten a lot more out of it .","281515":"ah , indeed .","281516":"it s all good . some people automatically assume new york means manhattan , when obviously new york is an entire state on its own .","281517":"i do live in new york , just not new york city , lol .","281518":"i don t live in new york city . i m honestly not the biggest fan of the city because it s so overcrowded , the streets smell like garbage , and there s too much happening . i can understand the appeal from a tourist perspective as a brief visit , but i d never want to live there .","281519":", most definitely . i don t remember much about , but i was years old and i ve blocked most of my memories out and from what i do remember of the subsequent teenage years , years old wasn t pretty .","281520":"yeah , i texted her and we talked on the phone for about minutes . i saw her yesterday i m seeing her again tomorrow .","281521":"five years ago , it was and i was years old . i had just begun working at the law firm i think and my mental health was declining rapidly . it was prior to me seeking treatment for mental illness , so i was depressed almost every day .","281522":"i ve been home all day , mainly sleeping on and off . i just made a quick , very unhealthy dinner and now i m going to try to find something interesting to watch on netflix .","281523":"well i m non binary , so technically i wasn t a girl friend but regardless of that , no i ve never been a bad partner overall . i have my flaws and faults , but i ve always had my partners best interests in mind and did everything to show my love and dedication towards them .","281524":"eh , it depends on their demeanor and how they are overall . if there are other things they re doing that show they don t care about the relationship , then i would believe that not knowing your birthday or anniversary might also indicate that . however , if that s the only thing they re doing , i don t think that they don t care . they could just sincerely don t remember , lol . i m not saying that s fine , obviously , because you should remember your spouse s birthday and anniversary , but it doesn t necessarily mean they don t care .","281525":"of course , lol . we ve always been extremely comfortable around each other .","281526":"omfg they re both asleep on my bed . i m crying .","281527":"they ve never worked on me , but i m sure they work on other people . i find pick up lines to be super cheesy , haha .","281528":"the skyrim soundtrack ! !","281529":"i don t recall ever doing that with my family , lmaoo . even when i was living with my parents , we didn t watch movies together .","281530":"lol . i mean . . . the world may never know .","281531":"i already have once or twice when we ve hung out after the breakup . lmaoo .","281532":"i understand this completely , lol . i ve had a few pregnancy scares .","281533":"i d wait because if you take the test too prematurely , it s going to come back negative and possibly give a false reading .","281534":"lol , no . even if he was , it isn t my business nor would i care .","281535":"she doesn t say it outright , but she implies it sometimes and i know the consequences of me not helping her will be worse than me just sucking it up helping her , so i just do what needs to be done . she s also gaslit me for most of my life , and still tries to sometimes , so it s something that s so innate in me that i m still feeling the effects from .","281536":"we have a mutual understanding of each other , but we re also not close either . i m pretty distant with both of my parents .","281537":"i have a weird relationship with my parents , tbh . because my mother ab sed me , i feel uncomfortable being around her but i still feel obligated to help out , even though i don t really want anything to do with her . at the same time , i feel bad for my father because he s dealing with her on a daily basis still putting up with her sh t and he doesn t deserve that either .","281538":"i go over there to clean and do laundry and take out the garbage . my father has been in florida for the past few weeks , so he hasn t been home to help out .","281539":"not really , haha . i m feeling pretty unmotivated overall .","281540":"i m all right , although pretty tired . i m debating on taking a nap even though i only woke up about four hours ago .","281541":"lol , it was pretty loud . we all started laughing hysterically , but i was still super embarrassed .","281542":"i m assuming you meant armpit , lmaoo . i sometimes have underarm hair , sometimes i don t . depends on whether or not i feel like shaving that day .","281543":"? ? ? farting is natural , but i don t purpose fart in front of other people unless you re my ex , since i ve always been most comfortable around him . body hair is natural too , and i do shave but not very often . especially considering i ve been in quarantine for eight weeks and haven t had the motivation to shave . either way , neither things are a big deal . god forbid a person doesn t feel like shaving their body hair , lol .","281544":"god forbid i accidentally fart in front of someone , lol . y all will make a big deal out of nothing , i swear .","281545":"i honestly don t remember , but i was in my early s after my ex s father started dating again . lmaoo .","281546":"the theory suggests that it s a subconscious desire , something we re not aware of until we re actually dating someone and we realize that the person we re dating is actually very similar to whichever parent . the theory behind the oedipus complex and electra complex in particular , however , is theorized to be part of the young developmental stage of childhood between the ages of and . freud isn t really looked at fondly in developmental psychology anymore , though , from my understanding .","281547":"isn t that the theory behind the oedipus complex from freud ? regardless , i ve only had basic studies on the theory and i certainly find it to be interesting .","281548":"i have so many photos of when i went upstate , haha . here s one of the scenic overlooks .","281549":"obviously not ? lmaoo .","281550":"i have no clue , i ve never asked for their opinion .","281551":"how about an inspirational phrase instead","281552":"upstate new york , surrounded by the mountains and forests and lakes and streams . i feel most at peace when i m surrounded by nature .","281553":"you re not really burning a bridge by letting the friendship fade , though . when i think of burning bridges , it s more of a feeling of animosity towards the other person , like if you two were to get into an argument or something and end the friendship in that manner . by letting the friendship go , there aren t really any hard feelings involved , it s just the natural progression of the friendship , or lack thereof . however , you should do what you think is best . if you think that it would be more beneficial to the two of you if you had that conversation , then perhaps do that instead . i would just be afraid that it would lead to bad blood , but those are my own insecurities , haha .","281554":"yesterday and friday , i went over to my parents house to help my mother do some things around the house , clean , organize the bedroom , pick up her medication from the pharmacy , etc etc .","281555":"my roommate picked me up a puff bar from the gas station because my vape has slowly been dying and it s going to be a few days until my new one comes in the mail .","281556":"at the moment a large iced coffee from dunkin . a bottle of sauvignon blanc for later tonight . more time during the day to nap and get chores done .","281557":"at this point in my life , no . it s damaging to regret things that you cannot change , and you cannot move forward with your life if you keep holding onto regrets from the past . the only thing we can do is accept them for what they are and continue progressing forward , learning the lessons we were taught from the mistake and using those lessons to better ourselves .","281558":"cont . . . we text like every one or two months but we are usually just asking how are you ? she also takes days to reply me and on one occasion months . i must admit i don t feel like we both are giving any more effort into this . i communicated to her about this already , but things are not improving . i don t want to invest in this friendship anymore , i tried many times to make it work and i don t want to try anymore . the both of us have changed too much and that s okay . i just don t know how i should deal with this . we used to be best friends but i know we don t feel this way anymore . advice ? if you feel that it is best to end the friendship , then there s nothing wrong with doing so . it s natural for people to drift apart as they ve gotten older , lose interest in the same things , and end up taking different paths in life . it s just a fact of life , and it s hard to swallow , but it s normal for stuff like this to happen . sometimes it s best to just allow the friendship to fade away , since that is how it appears it s going anyway based on what you told me , at least . stop trying to put effort into maintaining it , especially if you guys have talked about it already and nothing has changed . friendships should be worked on at both ends , not just one , and it s unfair to you to keep working on keeping the friendship alive when she doesn t do the same .","281559":"i m honestly not sure , haha . i m pretty much an open book .","281560":"i don t celebrate ramadan .","281561":"yes , i ve known who he is for many years .","281562":"no , i see her twice per week as it is .","281563":"dan soder .","281564":"meh , not really . i m just using my money and paying my rent and bills every month , so as long as i can pay everything in a timely manner , then i m satisfied .","281565":"idk , i m not really embarrassed easily . i suppose one of my more embarrassing moments was farting at the dinner table when i was having dinner with my ex and his family much earlier in our relationship , lmaoo .","281566":"i prefer something in the middle range not too soft , but not too firm . i can t sleep with a very soft pillow , but too firm makes me feel as if i m sleeping on a rock , lmaoo .","281567":"i don t recall ever voting for him .","281568":"probably not , no . it ultimately depends on who else is running for the presidential election besides biden .","281569":"i m mainly spending my days working , watching television , and playing video games .","281570":"rofl . no , i m using the question as a filler . i want people to ask me questions .","281571":"anyone want to ask me some questions to distract me ?","281572":"no , it has nothing to do with the coronavirus .","281573":"i m not the biggest fan , but i can appreciate his influence on the music community .","281574":"lol , no . not everything revolves around relationships .","281575":"i m single .","281576":"lol . three cheers for horrible coping mechanisms ! !","281577":"it s pretty serious , unfortunately . i m not comfortable discussing it on askfm , for now at least . i m just sad and feeling numb and weird at the moment .","281578":"i just ignore it until it eats me up inside then i have a mental breakdown over how disgusting my body is .","281579":"it was a good morning i woke up at a decent time , made coffee and breakfast , and had time to relax . afterwards , i went to my parents house to clean and do laundry , and i had to run a few errands for my mother . while i was at the house , we received some pretty bad news so i m not feeling the best right now , unfortunately .","281580":"depends on the kind of surprise , lol . it also depends on my mood in that particular moment , because sometimes i m not mentally prepared enough and it could lead to a bad reaction on my part .","281581":"everyday life inspires me the sounds of birds chirping outside my window , the howling of wind and rain during storms , flickering candles in the darkness , the smiles of loved ones , beautiful music , the nature of human kindness , animals , stories of people overcoming great obstacles , etc etc .","281582":"attain a level of tranquility and happiness with respect to my mental health . publish a book or two or three . adopt a lot of animals .","281583":"drink , smoke , vent to friends , sleep , and play video games .","281584":"i don t really know the source of my persistence in overcoming obstacles in my life . i can only suppose it s due to me trying to prove to myself that i can do it , and simply because i also believe i have no other option .","281585":"sneezing when confronted with bright sunlight , haha . every time i go outside and it s bright out , i sneeze at least once or twice . apparently it is something that s very common , but for the longest time , i thought i was just weird .","281586":"medically speaking , finding a cure for cancer and type diabetes .","281587":"i don t know if it would count as criticism , but my roommate gave me his honest opinion about how i should deal with my relationship or lack thereof with my mother . the only thing is , he doesn t understand the full scope of how complex it is . he advised me to be truthful to her about how hurtful she s being with her demands and how she treats me overall , but i ve tried that already in the past and it only resulted in her trying to make it about how i ve disrespected her , and she gaslights me into thinking i m the bad guy .","281588":"it would be awesome to see grandson or two feet live in concert . they re two of my favorite musicians .","281589":"i m doing good today ! ! i woke up a little while ago made breakfast and coffee , so now i m just drinking my coffee and browsing social media .","281590":"i believe women . it takes a lot of strength to come forward regarding a history of being assaulted , and there are only some cases where the allegations are falsely accused .","281591":"coffee ! ! particularly iced coffee , but i drink hot coffee most days too .","281592":"i like it every now and again , sure . the more veggies the better .","281593":"you re probably better off asking a teacher .","281594":"i always get weird anon questions , lol .","281595":"np ! ! ?","281596":"you re anonymous . regardless , the answer is no .","281597":"i m all right , just a bit tired . i went to my parents house after work to help clean and do the garbage cans , and i ended up staying there so much longer than anticipated . thankfully i m home now , there s pizza in my belly , and i m just about ready to crack open a beer and watch some television .","281598":"hah , i just saw this after i answered that person s question . you do you ! ! if people have a problem with you having an onlyfans , then obviously they re not worth your time or effort .","281599":"i don t have an opinion because it isn t my business .","281600":"egotistical and manipulative .","281601":"i don t follow people on request .","281602":"i m not a big fan of chocolate , but if i m in the mood for it , then i like dark chocolate .","281603":"i love going to diners , haha . there are dozens of diners where i live some better than others , and i can t wait for things to begin opening again so that i can sit down in a booth and order some food .","281604":"i haven t had a snack yet today , but i ate some pasta for lunch .","281605":"if you think i know anything about style or fashion , then you re absolutely wrong , lol .","281606":"it would probably be immensely different , considering i would have a spouse instead of being single , lol .","281607":"mine is just gray , haha . i don t change it very often at all .","281608":"sometimes i do , sometimes i don t .","281609":"nope , i didn t even know what that was until right now .","281610":"i have one coworker who has a pet lizard that looks like an iguana , but he s much bigger ! ! i m not sure what sort of animal he is .","281611":"there used to be one coworker who got on my nerves a lot because of the way they acted they always gave the impression that they were entitled and looked down on everyone . but they recently quit , so .","281612":"mac and cheese or a baked potato .","281613":"i ve had a stiff neck for the past few days , but other than that , no .","281614":"no ? there s nothing wrong or weird about being chinese .","281615":"watching the sunrise at am while cruising through the atlantic ocean .","281616":"wolves are my favorite animals . i have a lot of favorite television series , but lately i ve been re watching house .","281617":"depends on my existing mood . sometimes i m a in terms of being calm , but other times i m filled with rage and can get as high as a .","281618":"marijuana and cocaine .","281619":"i m feeling all right . i just woke up from a . hour nap , haha . i didn t feel like making dinner so i just ate a bowl of cereal better than nothing , i guess .","281620":"probably when i was around years old , i would party all night long and go right to work at am without getting an ounce of sleep .","281621":"i m exhausted and i m planning on sleeping immediately after clocking out of work today .","281622":"i helped in raising money for a memorial service through the church s boys basketball team years ago .","281623":"no . i explained why i wear makeup sometimes . if i wanted compliments or to impress people , i d wear it every day whenever i leave the house pre quarantine . i don t wear makeup to work because it isn t worth the effort and time .","281624":"regardless of a person s ethnicity , i d rather take the other person s last name .","281625":"it doesn t bother me , but i am aware that i should be exercising on a routine basis .","281626":"absolutely , lol .","281627":"out of those options , i prefer trains . i have the most experience on trains since there are a lot of railroad systems where i live .","281628":"not very far at all . i m fairly out of shape .","281629":"i don t have any tips besides to perhaps use shaving cream it makes your skin much smoother and it s easier to shave the hair , as opposed to simply using water .","281630":"hello . i don t follow people upon request .","281631":"makeup makes me feel better when i m out , for example going to the bar . it makes me feel more put together and now like the piece of trash i am , lol . i have no reason to wear makeup because i m not leaving the house regularly , i m not even getting out of my pajamas half the time .","281632":"yeah , i drink herbal tea fairly often .","281633":"it s a generalization you can t make an opinion on an entire group of people like that , lol . it isn t being politically correct , it s simply common sense . not everyone is going to agree with your opinion , and that s fine .","281634":"pm . almost midnight .","281635":"you can ask him what you two can do together when he isn t busy , even if he isn t physically available to hang out , i . e . skype or zoom calls . it s normal for people to have busy lives , but in a relationship you have to find ways to make it work .","281636":"it makes me feel more secure with the way i look , so yeah . however , i haven t worn makeup in a pretty long time because i have no reason to wear makeup .","281637":"i don t really think it s homophobic , but i do think it s kinda infringing on the lgbtq community . however , i totally understand why you would do such a thing . most people don t take no for an answer , which sucks a lot , and it s easier to make yourself inherently unavailable to that person instead of refusing their advances , since an lot of people mainly men don t really care if you say no .","281638":"lol , my mental health has been trash lately but i m trying to take each day at a time , and i ve been taking my supplements again so i think that s been helping somewhat as well .","281639":"ask me questions , y all","281640":"depends on the person . you can t really generalize people of each gender like that because everyone looks so radically different .","281641":"discussing mental illness includes conversation about the reality of living with mental illness , including all of the negative attributes and disruptive symptoms that come alongside it . romanticizing mental illness , on the other hand , often paints a picture that makes someone with mental illness seem more desirable or beautiful or tragic in a poetic way , solely because they have mental illness . it isn t an educated discussion , it s veiling the topic of mental health with metaphors that don t quite reflect the difficulties people have .","281642":"no , i don t give likes upon request like that . i only like answers of people i already follow who already have good answers .","281643":"i ve always driven smaller cars , i ve never owned a truck or suv before .","281644":"there are too many breweries in new york for there to be one overall brand that people are proud to drink . i can t think of a universal beer that everyone likes in that regard , most breweries are extremely varied with their selections .","281645":"considering the term mad generally refers to someone in a derogatory fashion who has mental illness , i d likely conduct experiments on various mental health treatments in order to provide the most relief for those struggling with various mental illnesses .","281646":"aw , thank you","281647":"i m assuming it s just called new york pizza , haha . i ve never tried pizza from other states before , though .","281648":"usually when people refer to all men are trash , they re projecting their hurt onto the population of men usually cis men , tbh as a whole because they ve had nothing but bad experiences with them this can include all sorts of ab se , assault , and or neglect . while i don t personally believe that all men are bad , i do sympathize with people who view men in that way because it s obvious they ve been hurt greatly and it s tainted their view of men in general .","281649":"it isn t something proven or guaranteed , but there are a lot of people who cope with depression through humor .","281650":"i don t think i ve tried the spicy doritos before .","281651":"i have no desire to use cocaine again , so probably that .","281652":"i have no clue . i don t remember the first years of my life .","281653":"this is very true ! ! i never thought about it that way before . and , yeah i agree . there s nothing wrong with people having body hair because it s natural . people can shave or not shave however they wish , it s no one s business except their own .","281654":"you would have to ask my friends .","281655":", maybe ? i m not exactly weird or anything i m rather normal .","281656":"i usually wake up around am , and it takes me about minutes to roll out of bed , use the bathroom , and make a pot of coffee . i ve been working from home for about seven weeks now , so my routine is very simple .","281657":"there isn t much to see outside of my bedroom windows besides my neighbors houses , haha . there are some trees in their backyard which look nice when the sky is sunny and bright blue .","281658":"my hair is getting so long","281659":"after a few years , yeah . i got curious

government lies about a lot of things . i m also sure that i ve read or watched somewhere that the government has worked directly with certain mafias in order to execute important figures .","281664":"yeah , i ve seen a few plays at the theater before .","281665":"quite the contrary , actually . it really has no effect on someone s hygiene , which is why men aren t being told its not hygienic because they re not expected to shave their underarms . it s simply another classic misogynistic view against women .","281666":"to each their own if some people want to be a trophy wife or a stay at home wife or mother , they have the freedom to do so .","281667":"i don t have any friends personally who have posted such things , but i do see it sometimes on my facebook feed . i disagree with the notion of the post in general . this pandemic has left people either incredibly bored or incredibly busy , and nearly everyone is emotionally exhausted and feeling the detrimental effects of this pandemic . some people don t have the mental energy to check in with others , and that s perfectly okay . you don t need to prove your friendship to other people by checking in on them all the time , especially during trying times like these .","281668":"i watched cartoon network most of the time , and i remember enjoying dragonball z a lot .","281669":"no , that s quite productive and i m sure you ll benefit from it greatly .","281670":"eh , not really . i hung out with a bad crowd of people in my early s , but i don t regret my friendships with those people because we had fun at the time and it was a learning experience .","281671":"i only have one brother , and we re not close at all . there aren t any best things or worst things .","281672":"i seldom shaved my legs and armpits even prior to quarantine , lmaoo . there was no reason for it i m covered up in the winter , so it s not as if people would see it anyway . plus , body hair is nothing to be ashamed of .","281673":"there was a period of my life where i refused to sleep in my bedroom , and instead , i would sleep on the living room floor in a sleeping bag or beneath the dining room table . the memories are blurry and fragmented , so i don t remember much about those times . i m not sure why i even did it in the first place .","281674":"i was going to go scuba diving when i traveled to the bahamas in february , but you needed a license for it , so i couldn t do it . perhaps if the opportunity arose , i would get a license and do training , because scuba diving looks extremely fun .","281675":"i know quite a few people who are making decent money off of their onlyfans accounts , and i see nothing wrong with that .","281676":", followers .","281677":"i would tell them outright that i don t see them as anything more than a friend . in those circumstances , you have to be up front and honest .","281678":"i don t think everyone , but most people who qualify for it have , yeah .","281679":"i m not a teenager , so no . i m attracted to whoever i m attracted to , there really isn t a stereotype or anything behind why i ve liked the people i have liked .","281680":"usually because of their back stories villians often endure trauma or other unfortunate situations , and i relate to that more than a hero who might have had a mild inconvenience and is now determined to save humanity .","281681":"i don t have an opinion on them , haha . i ve never been stung by a bee before .","281682":", the sweatpants are comfortable but a bit too warm for this time of year . the dinner was my roommate and i ordered guacamole , chips , and tacos ! !","281683":"depends on the movie . most of the time , i sympathize with the villian , though . i can t relate very much to stereotypical heroes in movies .","281684":"does dinner count ? haha . other than dinner , the last thing i bought online was sweatpants from amazon a few weeks ago .","281685":"i prefer shopping online , haha . i don t like crowds of people and can t stand shopping in stores most of the time .","281686":"i think i m more attracted to extroverted people because i m a natural introvert , it appeals to me when other people are more outspoken and it sorta balances us out .","281687":"what am i to be afraid of ? i m overweight i eat healthy food , but i m not sure what that has to do with fear .","281688":"we discussed it this morning , there s obviously nothing left to be said , lol . people will have a difference of opinion , and that s fine .","281689":"she didn t prove me wrong , lol . i m simply following the advice from medical professionals that is to stay inside whenever possible and practice social distancing .","281690":"i do ! ! i love some covers of songs and they can be very varied depending on the genre .","281691":"i like the song death bed coffee for your head by powfu a lot . https youtu . be jjpmntxl e","281692":"i m one of those white people who use it as an excuse to drink tequila and eat mexican food .","281693":"it s cinco de mayo , and since my homemade margarita didn t work out very well , i m ordering guac tacos for dinner . yolo . ask me questions , friends","281694":"honestly , i m coping through escapism drinking , video games , and television shows . when it comes to gaming and watching television , i try to get so engrossed in what i m doing that i forget reality , even just for a little while . if anything , my job has been keeping me grounded because it keeps me busy for hours per day .","281695":"yes , i wholeheartedly believe in aliens . i think it s a bit ignorant to assume that earth is the only planet in the universe capable of sustaining life .","281696":"i don t believe i have , no . you can barely see the night sky where i live , though . there s too much light pollution .","281697":"abandonment by my loved ones .","281698":"i like earth tones , like navy blue , mahogany , forest green , dark purple , and black .","281699":"yes , i inherited two cats from my roommates when we moved in together .","281700":"chester bennington , chris cornell , and scott weiland .","281701":"i do eat healthy . i just don t exercise like i probably should . my coworker said she s been taking a walk around the block during her lunch break , so i might start doing the same .","281702":"i never said it was illegal to go out ? lmaoo . it s not advised to go out for no reason not unless you re doing necessary shopping or taking a walk around the neighborhood while maintaining social distancing with neighbors in order to get exercise . the lockdown is supposed to lift in days , so we ll see what happens then .","281703":"not usually , no . i don t usually go to bed until pm or midnight .","281704":"thank you ! ! ?","281705":"thank you","281706":"time , primarily . i m not always depressed there are also moments where i m content and where i m enthusiastic . i ve just been noticing a pattern of depression that sets in around pm for the past week or so .","281707":"i only go out for necessities because it isn t advised to go out for absolutely no reason in new york . i went out sunday for shopping for a few hours , and i also went out last night to help my mother . i m not stuck in the house like you guys seem to think , lol .","281708":"i ve been under the weather lately , unfortunately . i ve been fairly depressed most nights when i don t have work to distract me , and i m just emotionally exhausted . my medication isn t working as well as it normally does , but that s likely because of external factors .","281709":"i used a filter from snapchat .","281710":"i ve never heard of that challenge before , lol .","281711":"financial stability . emotional stability . unlimited supply of coffee .","281712":"i guess mentally , solely because i m physically weak af .","281713":"buy an iced coffee from starbucks or dunkin , usually . i haven t went out to a coffee shop in a few weeks , though .","281714":"people can be exposed through dead strains once a vaccine is produced . otherwise , it s entirely unsafe and irresponsible to continue going out , seeing friends and family , etc etc . , knowing you could be a carrier and put them at risk as well as yourself at risk . hospitals are overflowing where i live . we have among the worst number of cases of any state because people live in such close quarters to one another and it s easy for the disease to spread . obviously i don t want this to happen either , but it s the truth of the matter .","281715":"marissa , this is a new disease which means that no one is immune to it . the fact that people have been under lock down and numbers are decreasing is showing that quarantining has been helpful . the coronavirus doesn t only attack immunocompromised and the elderly , as what we previously thought . people who are also relatively healthy have been catching the disease as well , and that s in part due to the fact that when one person carries it , they could spread it to more people and then those people can spread it to even more people afterwards . it is basic biology to state that we do become more immune to certain things after exposure , but we ve never been exposed to this before because it s an entirely new strain of something we ve never seen . the only way for things to get better is if people stay social distancing from one another , use protective gear , and only go out when necessary .","281716":"i ve never heard of that show before , but it sounds like something i would be interested in .","281717":"i have zero sympathy for the protestors . they have absolutely no concept of how dangerous and lethal this disease is , and they can still practice their religion at home so nothing is being infringed . churches are even holding video conferences of their services for those who still want to attend mass .","281718":"no , i don t do that . if i ever did , it was over six years ago

waters of the bahamas were absolutely beautiful .","281725":"i ve never had one before .","281726":"the fallout series is one of my favorite video game series ! ! tbh , i absolutely hated fallout , though . i m not a big fan of multiplayer games like that . i m currently replaying fallout new vegas and forgot how much i loved that game .","281727":"omg , i totally forgot she was in the picture . lol . yes , she s adorable .","281728":"a bit of both , i think . my first instinct is to go with my heart but then i have to remind myself to think logically about things .","281729":"my ex would surprise me with breakfast in bed on occasion , especially if my depression was acting up that day night . it was always super sweet .","281730":"i liked pokemon when i was a child . i remember eevee being one of my favorite ones .","281731":"i like my current bedroom a lot .","281732":"i ve been friends with one of them for around years , so we re fairly close . my other roommate is his brother and i didn t know him very well previously .","281733":"the only thing in my life right now that takes up a lot of time is work , but i don t mind it at all because it s been keeping me busy every day .","281734":"no , not everything . i don t even know everything about me , lol .","281735":"yeah , i still work every day so i know which day of the week it is still .","281736":"? ? ? you don t even know who they are , lmaoo . have fun living in a delusion , though .","281737":"my roommates .","281738":"well , i still have feelings for my most recent ex . as for my other exes , i haven t seen one in more than years and my other ex is my current best friend . i don t have feelings for either of them .","281739":"i ve been working since am .","281740":"of course . people have the right to modify their body however they wish .","281741":"my family never took vacations together , so i don t have any .","281742":"they had their reservations , but overall they didn t try to stop me because i m an adult and there was really nothing they could do about it . however , the downside is that my mother always wants me to contact her and visit , even now when we re in quarantine . i moved out last october . i was years old .","281743":"i do both , but lately i ve just been making my own iced coffee because i don t want to go out of the house to buy it .","281744":"no , i wouldn t be able to

before when i was a teenager . i ve also met barbara dunkelman of rooster teeth and griffon ramsey .","281754":"around years .","281755":"i never had good dental coverage while growing up so i barely

should start .","281760":"aw , thank you","281761":"i wouldn t date any of my askfm friends because they re my friends .","281762":"no , i only got halfway through the first one .","281763":"i m free to text my therapist if i want to share good or bad news , but you re technically not supposed to be friends with them or go out and see them until seven years after the professional client relationship has ended .","281764":"if you ve been together for five years and you trust him , then i see no reason for him to lie to you . it s probably just something as simple as what s in the past is in the past .","281765":"yes , i saw two or three different therapists before sticking with my most recent therapist . i was disheartened at first when the first few didn t work out because i thought i would never be able to find someone with whom i connected , but thankfully i did .","281766":"no , i haven t seen my friends since mid march .","281767":"no , i have a disordered personality

i was out of work completely .","281770":"well it s only sunday so my week has just begun . i went out and did some grocery shopping before now my roommate is bringing home some takeout for dinner . last week , however , was all right my days are blending into one at this point , and the only reason why i know what day it is is because of work , haha . i m getting cabin fever a little bit at this point , i should probably start walking around the neighborhood in my spare time but i don t really think about it .","281771":"this is a complicated question for me because i don t really know who myself is , and who i am changes day to day and whoever i m around .","281772":"i don t think i would be suspicious as much as i would be concerned . he could have very well been in an ab sive relationship and doesn t want to reflect back on that time . when he s ready to tell you , maybe he will . or maybe he won t and believes that the past is in the past for a reason . either way , what s important is the now and how you two spend time together and communicate . in all truth , past relationships shouldn t affect your current relationship .","281773":"does army print count ? haha , i m currently wearing army print leggings .","281774":"eh , i ve been doing all right . a large part of my problems stemmed from the fact that i was still living in an ab sive household , so once i moved out , i started feeling a lot more stable . i still have my ups and downs , depressive and hypomanic episodes , and just all around mood instability despite my medication , but i ve been reaching out to friends more often instead of holding things inside of me . my therapist was amazing , and if she starts practicing again i d probably go and see her again .","281775":"french fries vanilla or oreo ice cream .","281776":"my weekend has been fine . i didn t do much yesterday except sleep , play video games and browse social media , haha . today , i woke up around am and had coffee

has been fine . i made breakfast this morning had a cup of iced coffee while perusing the internet on my laptop for a few hours . i also did two loads of laundry . my roommate s car broke down , so i went to pick him up and bring him home from the mechanic a few hours ago . i finished up the leftover laundry , re made my bed with the fresh sheets , and now i m debating on cooking for dinner or having leftover pizza .","281804":"bring up your concerns with her then . cc sweetnothings","281805":"i disagree i believe that gender is a spectrum , and while there are two sexes excluding intersex people obviously , gender exists in a spectrum similar to how sexual orientation exists on a spectrum . there are trans men and trans women , but also non binary , genderfluid , and agender folks as well . being transgender is also not a mental illness , and trans identities were removed from the dsm and icd i believe a few years ago . it isn t recognized as a mental illness anymore . as for the other part of her answer , i m still unsure of my stance as to whether or not trans people need dysphoria to be trans . everyone has their own views on their identities , but i believe dysphoria is a large component of being trans as least in my personal experience . i would have top surgery if i could .","281806":"it s normally used to describe an urban area with things like poverty and whatnot . but some people may consider it a derogatory term towards poor people if it s used to describe people , not places .","281807":"it s a parody of the steps , a very old movie by alfred hitchcock . from what i remember , there were only or people in the entire cast , but several more characters to play , so the actors would constantly be switching from one character to another using various props . it s initially supposed to be a spy story thriller , but the play turns it into a comedy .","281808":"all of my memories prior to the age of and at this point , even my teenage years are sporadic and

absolutely hated it , i felt like it was pointless and not funny whatsoever .","281819":"absolutely there are dozens of movies that are based on real life events , particularly historical dramas . they give a unique insight into historical events and situations that are mostly factual . there are also documentaries which are movies , which are always educational as well .","281820":"i ve rewatched les miserables and sweeney todd a lot lately because they re comfort films to me . it wasn t really a good movie , but the other day i also watched a thriller gore movie called cabin fever

experience with edibles the first and only time i tried them . i was around or years old when i tried edibles , and back then , it wasn t something you can easily buy from a reputable person or corporation , especially in new york . me and a group of friends tried making them ourselves , and i ended up having an entire brownie which likely wasn t the best thing for me to do , considering i had little experience with marijuana at the time and it was a big dose . i essentially blacked out , lol . i remember bits and pieces , such as being in the backseat of my friend s car and watching all of the street lights zoom past with the different colors , and then we ended up at one of my friend s boyfriend s apartment somewhere out of town . i don t remember anything other than that , though .","281831":"i don t see why not you can still mark things off on the calendar or planner of things you need to get done throughout the course of the week , particularly with respect to necessary errands and household chores . you can also schedule virtual meetings with friends and family instead of seeing them in person .","281832":"browse social media askfm actually distracts me a lot from stress because i like answering the questions i receive . i also like playing video games as a stress reliever , watch television , read on occasion , and sometimes i ll draw or paint .","281833":"different regions have various dialects that determine a person s accent and pronunciation of particular words . apparently , i have a new york accent when i speak , which makes sense considering i ve lived in new york for most of my life . when i lived in massachusetts , i picked up on some boston accents as well . dieselmom isn t ghetto , and it s silly to keep bringing her into conversations on my page when you already know that her and i are close friends .","281834":"i m at a stage in my life where i m not involving myself in any necessary drama or complications in terms of either my personal life or other people s personal lives . i m approaching the age of , and there are more important things to me than how someone else decides to live their life .","281835":"depends on whether or not we have mutual friends . if we have a lot of mutual friends of people i know irl , then i ll probably accept the request . however , if we don t have any mutual friends at all , then i ll swiftly deny it .","281836":"when you re married , you re legally bound to another person through the court system and have exchanged formal vows . you own a marriage license and you re recognized as a married couple . when you re in a relationship , you re simply dating someone , either with or without the intent of marrying that person .","281837":"i believe there are certain creams and oils a person can use to get rid of stretch marks for example , coconut oil or vitamin e oil .","281838":"there could be things coming out because of the whole christmas in july trend , but i could be wrong . regardless , my favorite time of year is the autumn and halloween is my favorite holiday .","281839":"pee cahn .","281840":"no , i don t know what that is .","281841":"i don t really see anything wrong with that people are allowed to have friends regardless of their gender or their friends genders .","281842":"definitely not , lol . i don t trust anyone with my hair except my hair stylist . i wouldn t even want to try to shave my undercut by myself or have one of my roommates do it . it s overgrown , but i d rather wait until everything is safe again .","281843":"the best musical i ve ever seen on broadway was rent . as for musical movies , my favorites are les miserables and sweeney todd .","281844":"i don t feel comfortable in my own skin , no . i m honestly just disgusted with myself and the way i look all the time . however , i love my eyes , my hair especially after i ve colored and shaved it , and my cheekbones .","281845":"i haven t been doing any projects at all , haha . i mainly spend my time working , doing housework , playing video games , and watching television .","281846":"musicals , thrillers , dramas , and sometimes comedies . i also like gore films , which sorta transcends into the horror realm but i don t tend to like most horror movies .","281847":"it depends on my mood . i usually watch an episode or two of a show every night , but there are some nights where i m just not in the mood to watch anything .","281848":"i love quentin tarantino movies .","281849":"no , i don t believe i have any dvds anymore . i didn t bring any with me when i moved out of my parents house because i seldom watch them to begin with .","281850":"definitely not , haha . i seldom watch movies unless i m really in the mood for one . i mainly watch television shows .","281851":"yeah , i ve used netflix for a few years now .","281852":"no , not usually . i ve seen a few disney pixar films as well as a few studio ghibli movies .","281853":"yes , i love documentaries ! ! particularly true crime documentaries .","281854":"not usually , no . if i feel myself getting too sleepy , i turn off my television and whatever lights i have on .","281855":"lately i ve been re watching house every night , so i guess that s my favorite show at the moment , haha . i also love criminal minds , ncis , how i met your mother , parks and recreation , it s always sunny in philadelphia , wentworth , and bones .","281856":"i ve met the members of the band linkin park when i was a teenager , which was a dream come true for me . i m not sure if these people are considered famous or not , but they are in the video game and internet wise i ve met barbara dunkelman from rooster teeth productions as well as griffin ramsey , who used to be in rooster teeth and is now a well known wood carver .","281857":"i don t know who that is , so no .","281858":"one of my favorite works of art is death and life by gustav klimt . i think it s a beautiful painting of the juxtaposition of the concepts of life and death .","281859":"i ve had a long history of showcasing artistic works when i was a teenager , and although i ve dropped off a lot in terms of art , i believe that a mixed media work would suit me best . i like working with pastels , watercolor , charcoal , and ink the most , and the subject matter would revolve around mental health , stigma , and my innermost feelings .","281860":"more physicians , psychologists , and psychiatrists should take their time in listening to their patients concerns and display of symptoms instead of writing them off with a simple prescription and sending them along . there are a lot of doctors who see so many patients that they only allocate minutes for each appointment , which definitely isn t enough time to really get a full scope of how a person is experiencing a mental illness .","281861":"self medication is normally advised against by medical professionals , but i do know some people who do manage their symptoms of either mental or physical illnesses through supplements or marijuana . it s always best to obtain a professional opinion , of course , but if someone is going down the dark road of turning to drugs and alcohol as self management , then that s extremely unhealthy and can lead to further deterioration of their ailments .","281862":"i believe it s acceptable to self diagnose simply cases of depression or anxiety because those signs are easy to tell , and a simple general practitioner can diagnose those issues right away and refer a patient to a specialist . however , when it comes to more complex disorders i . e . personality disorders , it s wrong to self diagnose and claim that you have a certain disorder when you haven t been professionally diagnosed with that disorder . many symptoms of mental illnesses are co morbid , so your own interpretation of your illness may be entirely different from what a professional can ascertain after a psychological evaluation .","281863":"yes , it s extremely inappropriate to assume whether or not a person is disabled . it s also inappropriate to judge someone based on the status of their disability people are human regardless of their ability or disability , and to discriminate against someone because of their health is ableism .","281864":"i m always open to learning more about both physical and mental disabilities , particularly with an emphasis on such mental illnesses as personality disorders , psychotic disorders , and dissociative disorders .","281865":"i know a few people who are disabled , on both a physical aspect as well as mental aspect . i know people who are on disability benefits for both mental and physical illnesses , and i spent a good two years of my life working at a law firm where i directly advocated for the equal treatment of those who are disabled .","281866":"mental illness can be a disability , so yes . there are physical disabilities and mental disabilities , so there s really no separation between mental illness and disability since mental disabilities are just as debilitating as physical disabilities .","281867":"without a doubt , yes . there are still so many people who believe that mental health is not as severe or important as physical health but what those people do not know is that mental health often manifests itself in physical symptoms as well . mental health is just as physical as other physical ailments .","281868":"i struggle with several mental illnesses , so my main source of treatment is through psychiatric medication . i also attended intensive therapy for three years on a weekly basis until my therapist quit her job . now that i don t have therapy , i ve been relying on my friends more often for support and reaching out to others when i m not feeling mentally well .","281869":"yes , there s an immense stigma still surrounding mental health . the stigma has been lifted somewhat in recent years due to increased advocacy and awareness of illnesses , but there are still a significant number of people who hold close minded views regarding mental illness , whether out of willful ignorance or being uneducated . it s detrimental to mental health as a whole we all have mental health , and millions of people struggle with mental illness . it s something we all need to talk about .","281870":"and though i can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable , i simply am not there . american psycho","281871":"no , i haven t set any short term goals because the future is incredibly uncertain right now , and i m already emotionally exhausted as it is . i ve been trying to live in the present moment and take each day as they arrive .","281872":"look at this loveable chonk .","281873":"sorry for the terrible angle , but i don t feel like getting out of bed for a better photo , lmaoo . this is a painting my ex commissioned for me from our friend , who s a terrific artist and musician . it s my favorite piece of art that i own .","281874":"the look of love admiration on the person s face when they re looking at you receiving texts of love and appreciation at random moments during the day or week small gestures of affection when i m feeling particularly down emotional intimacy and having the feeling that i m innately understood and cuddling with someone with whom you feel safe .","281875":"having trust issues is generally bad , but i also have severe trust issues as well . however , it s something you have to resolve within yourself and with the support of people close to you you can t go from not trusting others to trusting people in the snap of a finger , and it s also just as bad to be too trusting of others as well .","281876":"there s really no such thing as an opposite gender because more than two genders exist . regardless , people can certainly maintain friendships with people outside of their own gender or sex , regardless of their sexual orientation .","281877":"sometimes you just have to put yourself in then uncomfortable position of speaking in front of people in order to feel more comfortable doing it . it would probably be best to ease those students into it , i . e . having them do a speech one on one and then increase the number of people in the audience .","281878":"i don t even remember when i said i ve been in love twice , lol . either way , my point still stands . i don t think i was in love with either of my other exes , i was extremely young and didn t really know what love entailed .","281879":"i m just as mature as other people in my age group .","281880":"if i said that i ve been in love twice before , then it s probably because i realized that the love i thought i felt wasn t being in love at all . there s nothing wrong with changing your mind on things , especially as we grow older and learn more about ourselves .","281881":"i ve fallen in love once in my life .","281882":"i used to use the treadmill and various arm leg exercise machines at the gym .","281883":"thank you very much it s quite dreary today , but sometimes i prefer overcast and rainy days over sunny days , haha .","281884":"good morning ! ! i hope you have a terrific day too","281885":"i don t believe so , no . i simply think the coronavirus was spread naturally and no country was adequately prepared to tackle something of this magnitude .","281886":"not generally , no . when i was a teenager , i used to watch america s next top model that was one of my favorite shows because i loved the creativity .","281887":"i haven t been to the movie theatre in at least years , tbh . i can t even remember the last movie i saw in the theatre .","281888":"most of my favorite movies i ve seen at least times . they re considered comfort films for me , and it brings me a lot of joy watching them .","281889":"i prefer watching movies at home that way i can pause it whenever i need to , get a refill on food and drinks , etc etc . it s also much cheaper because movie theatres in my area are ridiculously expensive .","281890":"yes ! ! historically accurate movies are among my favorites , especially period pieces .","281891":"i m not much of a fan of horror anymore because it increases my paranoia and anxiety , but i do enjoy thrillers and gore movies .","281892":"yes , i have one of those smart televisions . i have amazon prime , netflix , hulu , and hbo on there .","281893":"if i think i ll dislike a movie , i don t usually watch it at all . however , when i was in high school , napoleon dynamite was all everyone talked about i absolutely hated it , lmaoo .","281894":"i like movies , but i really have to be in the mood for them because my attention span has been terrible lately .","281895":"at the moment , it s either les miserables or sweeney todd ! ! i m a sucker for musicals . i also love heathers , the crow , the punisher , the shining , american psycho , the saw movies , the lord of the rings , etc etc .","281896":", followers .","281897":"my friend made a typo in a text message i started laughing hysterically .","281898":"tbh , i don t think i know anyone by that name .","281899":"i found it on google , but okay . i searched blood red aesthetic collage .","281900":"i m not a wild bear expert , so i don t know where they re prevalent in the united states .","281901":"lol , no .","281902":"i miss hanging out with my friends .","281903":"the medication i take is prescribed to me from my doctor . the only homeopathic medicine i ascribe to is sleep aids if i m having trouble sleeping , i take a few capsules of valerian root to help me sleep .","281904":"i don t find much pleasure in spending money unless i m feeling particularly hypomanic in that moment , haha . in those cases , i ll impulsively spend money on things but they re not useless items , at least . i always love when people buy me candles because i m obsessed with candles , haha .","281905":"i don t think my social habits have changed much , tbh . the only difference i think is that i m sh tposting more on facebook than anything else , lmaoo .","281906":"i don t ask people questions in general unless i already follow them i m extremely bored .","281907":"i ve always loved the aesthetic of modern or rustic looking cabins in the woods . i can definitely envision myself living in one .","281908":"even after the coronavirus slows down and halts , and restrictions are lifted , i still believe people are going to be extremely cautious around others because they re unsure of everything still . it s going to still have a detrimental effect on small businesses because they re going to have to try to accrue clientele again .","281909":"well , i live pretty close to new york city so that speaks for itself , lol .","281910":"caffeine nicotine , always .","281911":"doesn t really matter to me . preferably a bully breed , or perhaps a husky .","281912":"i d love to adopt a dog ! !","281913":"i normally just wear sandals .","281914":"i don t see that very often unless they re selfies and that s only sometimes , haha . normally the most basic , obscure answers receive the most attention which sorta confuses me .","281915":"on tuesday , i finished up the letter from the editor for my job s magazine publication i m quite proud of it .","281916":"i m not sure i understand the question . what sort of suggestions are you referring to ?","281917":"the most recent ones that come to mind are the silly users who pretend to be irs agents or microsoft technicians in order to receive sensitive information from other people on askfm , lmaoo .","281918":"i don t normally remember my dreams , and i honestly have no idea what i dreamt about last night .","281919":"yeah , i ve been to a baseball game and an ice hockey game when i was much , much younger .","281920":"no , i find them to be boring . however , my father is a huge fan of nascar .","281921":"i m apathetic towards wrestling . it isn t something i m interested in .","281922":"no , i ve never tried them before . apparently they re a lot of fun , though .","281923":"i believe all sports come with a certain degree of danger , but i think mma , wrestling and ice hockey are probably some of the most dangerous .","281924":"i don t know enough athletes to have a favorite , lol .","281925":"i haven t studied in at least seven years .","281926":"i m quite aware .","281927":"reading books is beneficial because you have the opportunity to think creatively in ways that are outside of the box , you learn new vocabulary , and you can use reading as a means of escape or learning independent from the outside world .","281928":"i m mainly an introvert , but i have extroverted tendencies . being around groups of people mentally and physically drains me . however , at the same time , i m also energized when i m around small groups of maybe people , particularly close friends .","281929":"depends on my mood , tbh . sometimes i m incredibly confident in myself and my abilities especially when it comes to writing , while other times i believe i m literal trash .","281930":"having a responsible attitude , being willing to work things out , expressing loyalty to their partner and friends , and having a mature aspect on life .","281931":"i don t have any games on my phone , actually . however , the last app i installed was zoom so that i could have video chats with friends and coworkers .","281932":"honestly ? coffee and nicotine .","281933":"yes and no . i m grateful that i live on my own with two roommates , have a job , and make enough money to be comfortable at the moment . however , there are still several aspects of my life that i m not happy with and i want to improve on those aspects .","281934":"not really , no . i align with many aspects of scorpio , but i don t really place much faith in astrology in general . i have a few friends who are really interested in their signs and placements and how it s interpreted into their personality , and i find it to be interesting too . i just don t necessarily believe in it .","281935":"sweeney todd is pretty inspiring to me , not going to lie . lmaoo . i love the grim , dark atmosphere of the movie and the taboo subject matter .","281936":"no , i ve never stood anyone up on a date before . i ve also been on only a few dates in my entire life .","281937":"i see myself getting married in the future , yeah . it isn t a priority for me at the moment , though . i m not even interested in dating right now .","281938":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","281939":"occasionally , sure . that s fairly normal and common among most people .","281940":"i ve dyed my hair pretty much every color besides green . i believe my favorite colors thus far have been dark red , electric blue which also had a hint of silver , pink , and dark brown with blonde highlights .","281941":"my natural hair color is a dirty blonde light brown almost like a mousy brown . you can see it somewhat in my current profile picture because the side of my head that s normally shaved has grown out quite a lot .","281942":"depends on what the message entails . i answer most questions that are given to me unless they re inappropriate , trolling , or not necessarily a question .","281943":"i have naturally straight hair , but as it s been growing longer , it has been taking on a wavy texture , which i love ! !","281944":"i seldom wear makeup unless i m going out at night to the bar or something with my friends . i applied makeup last friday night for a zoom video session with my coworkers for a virtual happy hour , but prior to that , it s been months since i ve used makeup .","281945":"i have seven tattoos ! ! the one pictures below is one of my favorites , haha . i love traditional style tattoos and want to get more of them .","281946":"when i was commuting to work in the morning , it would normally take me minutes or so in order to get dressed , freshen up in the bathroom , pack my lunch , and take my medication . however , now that i ve been working from home , i literally roll out of bed , turn on my computer , make a pot of coffee , and sit down to work . lmaoo . it takes maybe minutes in total .","281947":"i ve only been to one country outside of the united states , so i don t know much about most countries in order to determine what a favorite would be .","281948":"i m not quite sure what you re referring to , but regardless , anything that has the word tall in them sounds incredibly uncomfortable .","281949":"i used to solely wear converse when i was a teenager , but i haven t owned a pair in several years .","281950":"i honestly don t remember , haha . i barely remember my gym classes and i seldom participated .","281951":"no , i ve never been on the news before .","281952":"fruit snacks are delicious , but i prefer eating real fruit .","281953":"i used to be pretty decent at volleyball and i enjoyed playing badminton when i was much younger .","281954":"i don t like most sports so i don t really have a distinct favorite . however , i tolerate ice hockey the most .","281955":"i haven t watched the olympics in a while , but i used to enjoy the ice skating competitions and gymnastics .","281956":"on a historical level , i think it s disappointing because the olympics is something that has existed for over a century . at the same time , however , i believe it s necessary to reduce the spread of the coronavirus .","281957":"lol , no . fun fact i used to play on an adult volleyball team sponsored by the catholic church when i was in my early s . it only lasted one summer , but it was pretty fun .","281958":"ignorant . it s as simple as that .","281959":"when i lived at my parents house and it was mild weather , i would walk and job around the block a few times per week . once this pandemic slows down and things get back to a level of normalcy , i d like to start doing that again .","281960":"definitely not , lol . i have absolutely zero stamina for something of that caliber .","281961":"it s funny and probably fairly common , but the idea of exercising is daunting to me and it s one of the reasons why i haven t started it back up again . however , i ve also noticed that once i get into an exercise routine , i actually do enjoy it and feel proud of myself for doing it .","281962":"no , i m not a fan of sports in general . the only sport that i have a slight interest in is ice hockey .","281963":"yes , i can swim although not very well , haha . i used to love swimming when i was much younger .","281964":"i haven t been exercising lately , but i try to eat healthy on a regular basis . i ve also started taking a multivitamin every morning .","281965":"yeah , sports stars definitely are paid too much money for what they do . i understand that they re talented and sports is a source of entertainment for millions of people , but i believe that people such as health care workers and scientists should be seeing the same level of pay because they re contributing to the betterment of humanity and society every day .","281966":"in the united states , the biggest sports are football and baseball , closely followed by basketball and hockey .","281967":"work , video games , and re watching old television shows that i used to love are definitely comforting to me through this entire pandemic . they allow me to escape reality for just a little while and they give me something to occupy my time . i have fairly unhealthy coping mechanisms , which includes drinking and vaping , but i ve also been trying to reach out to friends more often when i m not doing well .","281968":"i ve only seen howl s moving castle , spirited away , and kiki s delivery service . however , all of those movies are absolutely beautiful and spirited away is my favorite of the three .","281969":"i would miss working , i m not going to lie . having a steady routine every day , which includes work , is what keeps me somewhat stable and i would probably descend into a deep depression if i didn t have something like a job to occupy my time .","281970":"for me , it s a little bit of both i enjoy my job , but i also take my job seriously because it s the means by which i can afford my life and pay my bills . it isn t my ideal job , but my job is definitely something i can see myself doing for quite a few years from now . i feel fortunate to have found a workplace that not only allows me to express my creativity , but allows me to be responsible and have a sense of fulfillment at the end of the day .","281971":"i m angry at the justice system in the united states , which often blames and punishes victims of crimes while letting the actual criminals off with less time or even no time than they deserve . there s more pressure and discrimination against people of color in the united states when it comes to arrests by law enforcement , and racial bias is still very strong . as for the state of new york , i m angry that the board of elections canceled the presidential democratic primary elections that was supposed to happen in late june . we can t even do mail in ballots .","281972":"if we re going personality wise , i d probably choose a sloth . lmaoo . they re also incredibly adorable creatures . however , i ve also always wanted an axolotl . they re such interesting animals .","281973":"i m not afraid of the mistake itself , but i m afraid of the consequences of those mistakes , whether the consequences are from a higher up in a professional sense or my own expectations . mistakes are human . we all make mistakes , and most can be forgiven . however , i have such a high expectation of myself that when i do make a mistake , i beat myself up for it .","281974":"i feel as if i was born in the right era , yeah . when i was younger teenage ages and more naive , i was always that type of person to say , i m an old soul i was born in the wrong decade ! until i realized how silly that sounded . if anything , my clothing style is casual and it most resembles s grunge . but i grew up in the s , so it still fits .","281975":"very much so ! ! i have no desire to live in a huge home or mansion or anything extravagant . as long as there s enough room for me , my partner , and some pets , that s good enough for me .","281976":"i normally use youtube to listen to music while i m working , which is normally classical music or video game movie television soundtracks . i also watch achievement hunter and rooster teeth videos , and occasionally markiplier , because i like gaming videos . i also enjoy buzzfeed unsolved .","281977":"at least glasses per day .","281978":"do you mean lychee ? if so , i ve never had it before .","281979":"i have no idea what that is .","281980":"yes , i love mangoes ! !","281981":"no problem ! ! i hope things work out .","281982":"oh damn . i m sorry . i m not entirely sure . there are other sites like askfm called curiouscat and tellonym , but i wouldn t really consider them social media like facebook or instagram .","281983":"snapchat , perhaps ?","281984":"my weight . i m trying to convince my roommates to help me take apart the treadmill in the garage and bring it downstairs into the basement so i can start using it again .","281985":"i ve always felt best in neutral , muted tones pale green , black , navy blue , burnt orange , etc etc .","281986":"destroying myself in seconds flat without an utter care in the world .","281987":"mayonnaise .","281988":"rules are just guidelines , so . . .","281989":"write something creatively . i ve been struggling emotionally for a while now i need to get it out of my system .","281990":"no , i ve never been a fan of pubg . i used to watch my ex play with his friends on xbox , and it was really entertaining but i was never interested in playing myself .","281991":"twilight","281992":"checking in on me to see how i m doing or feeling . taking my thoughts and opinions into consideration during discussions . having a civil talk about disagreements instead of it escalating to a bad argument . encouraging me to pursue my goals and passions regardless of what they are . not being afraid to call me out on my behavior if i m being irrational or problematic . taking time to get to know my friends and actually be friendly with them . reassuring me and comforting me when i m having a particularly bad mental health day .","281993":"no , i disagree . a problem can still be a problem even if someone doesn t make it out to be a problem at all , and that normally happens in cases when people are ignorant , afraid , or insecure . just because they don t emphasize that it s a problem to them doesn t erase the fact that it s problematic .","281994":"i live on long island and the stereotypes are often that we re rude and entitled , are incredibly wealthy , move faster than the speed of light , and are basically either italian , jewish , or both . most of those are true , considering a lot of people born here are taught to be fast paced in their lifestyles . sometimes that can be interpreted as rude , and some people are rude , because they just want to get to where they need to be and do their business as quickly as possible . however , the only wealthy people live either on the very north shore or really far east like the hamptons , and a large majority of us are just middle class .","281995":"i ve never envisioned myself having a large wedding . something quaint in the woods or on the beach with a limited number of people is fine by me . i d rather have a band over a dj , the decorations on the table like flower arrangements and whatnot would be hand made , and it would have a rustic feel to it .","281996":"depends on my mood in that moment . right now , i feel like a because i m an utterly trash person .","281997":"not really , no . dogs are products of their environments and even breeds that have a bad reputation are usually incredibly sweet , loving pets .","281998":"i really value my friendships with shehitsback , celinem , manicmartyrdom , dieselmom , and courtneyuwu .","281999":"during my teenage years , i was mainly into alternative rock , classic rock , and nu metal . my favorite bands were linkin park , stone temple pilots , evanescence , korn , limp bizkit , audioslave , orgy , alice in chains , def leppard , motley crue , my chemical romance , sum , brand new , and taking back sunday .","282000":"this really confused me this morning because it s tuesday where i live , lmaoo . maria by two feet . coming undone by korn . my demons by starset . someone you loved by lewis capaldi . twisted by missio .","282001":"at the moment , we all should adhere to the cdc and who guidelines in maintaining social distance , self isolating , only going out for necessary items , and wearing proper masks and gloves . the people protesting for businesses to open are ridiculous and they re only going to prolong the existence of this virus and possibly even cause a second wave . we all want to return to a sense of normalcy , but we also need to listen to the professionals who are urging us to stay home .","282002":"every age i ve been have had its high and low points , so it would be impossible for me to choose one specific age .","282003":"no , that s actually never happened to me before . i don t really post as often as other people on my friends list do .","282004":"my own self destructive tendencies , lmaoo .","282005":"everything else besides my hair , eyes , and cheekbones .","282006":"my hair although right now , it looks

make the most out of my work days .","282008":"you need to heed my words and realize that your desires are unwarranted , unnecessary , and unrealistic . i won t be responding to these inquiries anymore .","282009":"like i stated twice already i have no interest in talking to you .","282010":"? ? ? no , you don t . that doesn t change anything either . i couldn t care less about your feelings towards me .","282011":"apparently you don t understand that i have zero interest in talking . if you wish to ask me a question , do so here on askfm . otherwise , i have nothing else to offer .","282012":"i don t think i would do anything differently , tbh . i m happy with the outcome of my schooling . the only thing i can think of is perhaps continuing my education to get a master s degree , but i wouldn t know what i would pursue and it would only add onto the debt i already owe .","282013":"school was typically easy for me in the aspect that i didn t really need to study in order to do well . however , my college days were also stressful but those were mainly due to external factors .","282014":"both my instagram account and facebook account are private . i don t give out my urls .","282015":"i miss learning and sitting in lectures , but school itself was rather stressful for me . i did , at one point , juggle a job as well as college but i don t think i d be able to handle that anymore .","282016":"i m five feet tall .","282017":"you re speaking with me now . if you have a question , feel free to ask .","282018":"lately all i ve been doing is playing video games and watching television . on occasion , i also like to read , draw , and paint as well .","282019":"i m fairly talented at writing , but there s always room for improvement .","282020":"perhaps my x files poster and skyrim map , both of which hang on my wall ? haha .","282021":"i m sincerely hoping you mean message . regardless , i m not interested .","282022":"hazel green depending on the light .","282023":"my instagram is private .","282024":"i m not that much of a jealous person anymore , although i used to be when i was younger .","282025":"yes , i have netflix , hulu , and amazon prime .","282026":"yes ! ! haha , they were very short lived .","282027":"i don t have one particular favorite color , but i like earth tones the most i . e . forest green , navy blue , maroon , black , gray , and dark purple .","282028":"i m a scorpio .","282029":"lol , omg i remember that completely . i don t think people in the us had those capabilities , though i could be wrong .","282030":"i never got detention when i was in high school . however , i did serve one day of in school suspension for a really ridiculous reason we were supposed to keep our id badges visible at all times and a security guard caught me with my id in my pocket instead of around my neck .","282031":"not while i was in high school , no . however , i ended up skipping a lot of classes when i was a freshman in college and failed out of two classes .","282032":"my high school wasn t too big on field trips because they didn t have much of a budget , but our senior trip was a boat ride around the statue of liberty , which was pretty fun .","282033":"i didn t receive any awards , but i was inducted into the golden key national honour society and graduated magna cum laude .","282034":"while i was in college , i really enjoyed the opportunities i had to take several electives in subjects that weren t necessarily tied to my major topic of study . i took a few psychology , sociology , and anthropology courses and those really intrigued me .","282035":"my major in college was communications professional writing when i attended my second school . when i was a freshman at my first school a liberal arts college , i majored in creative writing .","282036":"yes , i graduated from college in with a bachelor s degree .","282037":"i was a hard working student and received a s in most of my classes . i didn t have a big circle of friends because i mostly spent my time doing classwork , and my main goal was to get good grades in order to attend a college out of state .","282038":"my forensics teacher when i was a senior in high school was my favorite teacher . he was extremely open , honest , and down to earth in all of his lessons and he was more of a mentor than a teacher , in all honesty .","282039":"i absolutely hated calculus , haha . i was always pretty decent at math , but i didn t like the subject at all .","282040":"my favorite subject in high school was always english . i also really enjoyed a college level forensics course i took when i was a senior in high school .","282041":"physically , probably my eyes . emotionally , likely my empathy and compassion for others , as well as my aptitude in creative expression .","282042":"i m not interested in boats , so i don t have a dream boat .","282043":"i just shrug it off it doesn t bother me anymore , especially if it s coming from a stranger whose presence is not valuable to my life . i couldn t care less about what someone random thinks about me .","282044":"my birthday is november th .","282045":"i was born in .","282046":"good morning ! ! my plans are to finish working my normal hours , visit my mother to drop off some supplies for her , order or cook something for dinner , and relax with some television or video games tonight .","282047":"i honestly don t remember it s been a very long time . probably when i went out to eat with a coworker last summer we got a booth outside .","282048":"nah , i seldom visit manhattan . i ve honestly never heard of the place before .","282049":"i keep my phone on my bed while i sleep , but that s only because it needs to be close to me in order for me to hear my alarm go off in the morning . with the exception of the past few nights , i don t normally wake up in the middle of the night at all .","282050":"i currently live with two roommates .","282051":"it s dark outside i can t hear any rain , so maybe not ? i haven t left the house in hours and i closed my blinds around pm .","282052":"aw , thank you ! !","282053":"you can see them clearly in this picture","282054":"y all really have me googling what is trap music at at night .","282055":"i listen to lo fi beats , does that count ? lol .","282056":"maybe i m just on the older side , but i m not sure what trap music is , lol . i mainly listen to alternative rock , hip hop , nu metal , indie rock , and some pop songs .","282057":"i wouldn t go so far as to say hate , but i ve definitely gotten annoyed with a lot of songs after a while because of how much they were overplayed .","282058":"i just googled it and apparently her solo album is coming out may th . i want to say i heard one of her singles on the radio weeks ago , but i honestly can t remember .","282059":"of the time , i m answering questions . the only times i ll ask questions are if i m hella bored on a weekend and have nothing else to do . i ll send out a question or two maybe once every few weeks .","282060":"i haven t written fanfiction since like . . . . lmaoo . i honestly have no idea .","282061":"correct me if i m wrong , but isn t she already coming out with a solo album ? i thought i read that somewhere . either way , i think she has a terrific voice so i m sure she d succeed as a solo artist .","282062":"i don t remember ever listening to them .","282063":"yeah , i used to like paramore a lot in the early s . i saw them perform live at a small venue on long island before they really became ridiculously popular .","282064":"haha ! ! that reminds me of creepypasta . . . which i ve also never used . back in the day , all i did was frequent band forums , fanfiction websites , myspace , and deviantart .","282065":"i m uncertain because i haven t visited any other countries besides the bahamas , so i m not sure how i d feel about them unless i actually went there to get a feel for their culture .","282066":"i used limewire , lmaoo .","282067":"i ve actually never used chan before , haha . in that same vein , i ve also never used reddit either .","282068":"no , i vehemently oppose the death penalty .","282069":"nah , i definitely didn t draw it myself . it was from one of those trending anime avatar creating websites .","282070":"i began using the internet regularly when i was around years old , so that was around . but those memories are mostly hazy , at this point .","282071":"no , i thankfully haven t gotten the virus . i ve been self isolating since my job started us all working from home , and both of my roommates have been doing their best to be safe as well they re both essential workers . i know a lot of people who have been diagnosed , though , and thankfully they recovered . unfortunately , a few of my coworkers know people who have died though .","282072":"oh , i just googled what a rage meme was and that was evident years ago , lol . it was from the early s , not s . i don t know much about those times , i was pretty young .","282073":"i m not sure what the statistic is , so i m fairly uneducated on the subject . i d have to conduct more research .","282074":"lmaoo . i haven t gotten an anon like this in a while . the whole sunlight analogy really got me though , i m legitimately laughing .","282075":"i m not quite sure i know what you re referring to .","282076":"they re both democrats , from what i remember .","282077":"yes , i ve been working from home since mid march .","282078":"i don t have tik tok , but i ve seen quite a few hilarious videos .","282079":"i m not being condescending at all , tbh . the conversation initially started off well then you pulled a few weird analogies and totally eradicated your own point and credibility . the fact is , we re talking in circles which is a waste of time . if you can t see my perspective despite the evidence i ve presented you , then that s on you .","282080":"i m not wrong . your hypotheticals are just ridiculous and i don t appreciate the condescending attitude . therefore , this conversation is over .","282081":"fun fact i ve never seen a single star wars movie .","282082":"the new york democratic presidential primaries have been canceled , so i can t vote .","282083":"i did last year , but i don t remember where i scored . and i m definitely not doing it rn because i don t have the patience for that at the moment , haha .","282084":"oof , i m sorry . i hope you re being safe , at least ! !","282085":"i can see both aspects of it . on the one hand , it s necessary for essential workers to get to work . however , on the other hand , you re correct it s probably one of the biggest hot spots , which is unfortunate .","282086":"oh , lmaoo . i thought you meant like a mall rat , like you were a delinquent or something . regardless , i m not pushing this conversation any further because it isn t going anywhere . you re evidently not seeing my point .","282087":"where do you live , if you don t mind me asking ? it s really bad where i live too , but tbh i haven t even been out enough to know if whether or not people are adhering to social distancing isolation rules . i went out this afternoon for the first time in over a week .","282088":"do you mean governor cuomo ? i haven t watched many of his press conferences , so i m unsure .","282089":"uh . . . are you asking me to dispute facts about your childhood ? and whatever a mall child is ? your argument makes absolutely zero sense , my dude .","282090":"at the moment , it doesn t seem so . then again , i ve only lived here since october and we ve been under quarantine since early march .","282091":"haha , i don t have a skincare routine . i just moisturize after i shower . i have a nutrient rich facial moisturizer that i use after i exfoliate in the shower . i have a few body lotions and body washes , and right now i m using dove s coconut milk with jasmine body wash .","282092":"i don t interact with people irl , so no . lmaoo .","282093":"i lmao , i literally can t even with this conversation . i totally understand your point , but this is just silly . also , the whole condescending attitude definitely doesn t fly with me , so unless you have some facts involved with this , i m just going to cease this conversation . we re talking in circles .","282094":"you can google disinfectant cases or something similar on google find news articles that indicate there has been an uptick in cases since trump made his comments .","282095":"this whole i need to open up my body thing is utterly confusing , and albeit hilarious . i m going to be quite frank unless you have a valid analogy , then i m not going to take this seriously .","282096":"you re literally comparing this grave and dire situation to a television show and a weird hypothetical situation , lol . if you re trying to make a valid case , then i can appreciate that if you used fact and reasoning . but right now , people are becoming ill because they listened to trump . he s in a position of authority and he should also have a better grasp of the gravity of his words .","282097":"exactly the fact that there has been an elevation of poison control calls and emergency room visits because of people trying to ingest disinfectant right now is alarming . obviously it s common sense not to do that , but some people will anyway . it s inevitable .","282098":"they re not , but all right . i m not here to have a silly argument over semantics trump literally used the words inject a disinfectant and that s all some people need for confirmation . there have been a rise in poison control calls in the us for people ingesting disinfectants after he made that comment .","282099":"colors lilac blue and stormy gray . songs someone you loved by lewis capaldi and river flows in you by yiruma .","282100":"my bed is my cozy corner .","282101":"okay , now that s a reach . lmaoo .","282102":"even though he didn t tell people outright , hey , please do this ! he s still putting the idea in people s minds . it s dangerous to even suggest that during a conference where millions of people will be watching . he should have , at the bare minimum , explained that scientists and virologists are trying to pursue different medical paths to combat against the virus without outright saying injecting a disinfectant . https youtu . be yo ksihc a","282103":"i always have my phone on vibrate . i never set it to a sound , unless i m gaming or something and i m waiting for an particular text or call that i wouldn t hear the vibration of since i m engrossed in the game .","282104":"tbh , i ve never really had a type . lmaoo . everyone i ve liked has looked totally different from one another .","282105":"i was raised catholic , but i never actually believed in god . the idea of there being god s never really appealed or made much sense to me , largely because i ve never had that sort of faith . if anything , eastern philosophies appealed to me the most growing up , especially ones that dealt with nature .","282106":"i don t remember my childhood , or at least whether or not my parents read to me . i was told that i started reading on my own at a very young age and it s carried on through adulthood .","282107":"i know i m a scorpio , but that s the extent of it .","282108":"it feels like the past months have lasted an entire year .","282109":"i was bullied in middle school early high school .","282110":"nah , you re definitely not alone in these feelings at all . i would recommend talking to your doctor about it , if it s a side effect of one of your meds they might be able to switch you to something similar or lower the dosage or whatever they think is best . i was on a certain medication that completely erased my libido , so eventually when i stopped taking the med , my libido came back . ah , the perks of being mentally ill . ?","282111":"you re definitely not alone ! ! if it s bothering you enough , you can also ask your doctor about it too idk if you see a gp or therapist or psychiatrist . also , if you re on any sort of medication especially psych meds that will definitely alter your hormones too .","282112":"serotonin and dopamine .","282113":"i have a friend who literally cries after they orgasm not in a bad way at all , but because their hormones go wild and it causes them to cry even though they feel great afterwards .","282114":"they re all hard working , immensely loyal , passionate , hilarious , and strong individuals . they ve all been through some sort of significant hardship in their lives which they ve overcome and used those events to push them further in life .","282115":"you d have to ask my friends .","282116":"if you already struggle with mental health issues , then it s common to have a weird relationship with sex like that . all of your hormones and body functions go wild during the act of sex itself .","282117":"yes , they do . otherwise i wouldn t be friends with them , lol .","282118":"it s common knowledge that orgasms release the hormones dopamine and oxytocin , so yeah . this occurs in people regardless of gender .","282119":"i d compare it to music or certain feelings .","282120":"thank you ! ! yes , once everything opens up again , i do want to see if i can purchase tickets somewhere .","282121":"i seldom go to the beach , but when i do , i just like sunbathing and going into the water to cool down every now and again .","282122":"fried eggs , avocado , veggie cream cheese , butter , or raspberry jam .","282123":"it s been at least years , lol .","282124":"no , but i m thinking about writing creatively or drawing tonight ."}}
