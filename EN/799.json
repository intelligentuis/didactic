I pretended like I was in a movie and I was a little bit over dramatic and silly and ended up having some really really great times.\n  ","858326":"\n  I don\u2019t worry about that anymore. But when I did, I still didn\u2019t. Guys say they like specifics and they will go to what attracts them. There is no way to tell what attracts every man because every man is different. Literally being yourself, someone will notice you. Everyone is someone\u2019s type to someone. It\u2019s a big world out there. If you want to know what a specific guy looks for, ask that specific guy.\n  ","858327":"\n  Quite a few actually and I\u2019m surprised because by no means is my life together.

I would love to travel.\n  ","858331":"\n  A flip phone is still a good phone. I count a \u201cgood phone\u201d being able to make calls. Which is the prime purpose of a phone. A landline is a great phone.\n  ","858332":"\n  I don\u2019t know \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don\u2019t follow anyone on here or pay attention to anyone else\u2019s profile.

It REALLY depends on the situation.\n  ","858335":"\n  Can you word this question differently... I have no idea how to answer.\n  ","858336":"\n  You just know.\n  ","858337":"\n  Oh I don\u2019t have just one song. I have a whole \u201cdance party\u201d playlist.\n  ","858338":"\n  Oh I love most all commercials. Sometimes they\u2019re more interesting than the shows. The commercials in between the Superbowl are the best.\n  ","858339":"\n  I don\u2019t think I could be more sure.\n  ","858340":"\n  Stayed in an abusive relationship.

What\u2019s my opinion on people?! Um, they\u2019re people. Some people rock some people suck. I don\u2019t know everyone, so I can\u2019t judge those I don\u2019t know.\n  ","858346":"\n  I\u2019m not studying for anything right now.

I\u2019m a cat lady and I\u2019m known for picking the older cats because I know they are less likely to be adopted. Usually the older cats already have names and I\u2019m not trying to change a name they\u2019ve been called their whole life. But I think any pet that I get, if it didn\u2019t have a name yet, I\u2019d have my son choose.

I have no idea. I have had no desire for a boat so I\u2019ve never thought about it. Maybe: Island Girl\n  ","858362":"\n  I don\u2019t think I really know any of them. The few things I\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t really like any of them either.... and I can say that.

My grandma got rid of my first dog while I was at school.\n  ","858373":"\n  Write it for yourself first, like a vent letter. Wait some time for everything to cool off (if\/when you\u2019ve moved out) take some real time to think about everything. After a while, maybe days, weeks or months depending on your situation, read the letter you wrote. Did anything change within that time? Anything you would take out? Add? Make changes and write a new one. Then give it to her.

I had to set boundaries with her and let her know that I needed space. I recommend writing a letter to her about everything that is bothering you with your relationship. Leave nothing out. Hopefully she will respect it. If you need someone to read it out for comments\/critique before you give it to her, try to find someone... again, someone who is trusted.\n  ","858378":"\n  Warmth, good smells, a space\/time to write.\n  ","858379":"\n  Lint \ud83d\udda4\n  ","858380":"\n  Writing\n  ","858381":"\n  Yes\n  ","858382":"\n  Do you live with them?
