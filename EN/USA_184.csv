  I’m definitely missing the positivity that we need on this platform. There’s way to much negativity and people talking sh*t on this app it’s rather sad.  It would be a better experience if we could have more positivity and kindness and love spread around here. 🙂

  I would say the worst part of losing your sense of smell would be you wouldn’t be able to smell your favorite smells, you wouldn’t be able to smell the food you eat, you wouldn’t be able to smell anything
  
  I don’t believe there’s a best part of losing your sense of smell. It would be depressing.

  {My name is Nicole, but you guys can call me Nikki if you’d like. I also have other nicknames but I like Nikki the most.}
  
  { I’m currently 20 years old and my birthday is on September 7th}
  
  {I’m currently a student in college and going to transfer to a university very soon. I’m not sure which one just yet. As far as my major goes I’m not quite sure. I might major in psychology or interior design but I’m not sure yet.}
  
  { my height is 5’7 and yes I’m pretty tall}
  
  { don’t ask me if I eat lol because obviously I do. I know I’m really skinny but that’s just how I’ve always been. Im naturally very skinny.  And as far as my weight I’m underweight}
  
  {I’m from California born and raised there.
  
  { I have brown eyes sadly, and my hair is ginger, copper or strawberry blonde whatever you call the color I have lol}
  
  {I post a lot of pictures myself but now I use a watermark because people make fake accounts and use my pictures}
  
  { I am very much single until I find someone}
  
  { as far as my sex life goes that’s very much none of your business. It’s for me to know and so I won’t answer questions dealing with that}
  
  (I’m very much straight and into guys}
  
  { Maroon 5, Coldplay, Linkin Park, Dead by sunrise and thirty seconds to Mars are my favorite bands that I listen to a lot}
  
  {Chester Bennington as you all know means the world to me and I miss him very much. I hope he’s beautiful soul is resting in peace truly. Such a legend and he will always be remembered through his music and memories. Also remember to keep his legacy and spread it around too. He deserves it. Such a talent and unique voice. Very angelic and he screamed like a devil. 2 years without him already it tears me apart when I think about that💔. Again as you know he motivates me and inspires me every single day through his music. A piece of me died along with him when I heard the news. But he is always here with us in spirit and will always be in our hearts and always remembered as the legend he was💞. {Chester Bennington 1976-2017👼🏻}
  
  { you guys, can always ask me for advice or anything that you need because I will always be there for you guys!}

   How can you tell if someone's truly your friend, or if they're just using you?

  I’m very bad at seeing the signs I end up finding out at the end of the friendship that they were using me but my mom is very good at seeing the signs and seeing what kind of person they’re at the beginning and she tells me but of course I don’t listen.  I mean if they’re good at it you can’t really tell if they’re using you. Most people nowadays aren’t really your friend but they’re rather just using you because they don’t want to be lonely or maybe because they just do it to take advantage of you.  If someone’s truly your friend I think you could tell I mean it would be pretty obvious if they’re truly your friend and not just using you. It’s all about their behavior and actions and that’s how you can tell if they’re truly your friend or just using you.

   Why do you think some people love to people please, even when they know it won't work out in their favor?
  ","
  I think some people like to please other people because they’re just used to doing that. Like maybe when they were children and young they got taught to please people by their parents or just by themselves.  Or maybe people like to please others even though it won’t work in their favor because they like doing so or maybe it makes them feel happy to please others.  I guess it just depends on their personalities and how they grew up and whoever taught them while they were younger.

  "
989122,"
   When someone lashes out at you, is it a reflection of how they view themselves more than how they view yourself?
  ","
  When someone lashes out on you, I believe it’s a reflection of themselves and how they view themselves. It shows their true colors and who they really are in the inside. I definitely think it’s mainly how they view themselves and all this anger built inside causes them to finally lash out and you were probably just in their way so they end up lashing out on you. I don’t believe it’s how they view you it’s more how they view themselves.

   So my daughters best friend still believes in Santa and the Elf on the Shelf. She’s 11 and in middle school. How old were you when you learned the truth about Santa? And do you think it’s a little odd her parents still go along with it? You’d think the kids at school would of clued her in by now.
  ","
  I don’t remember how old I was tbh.  I mean if she wants to believe that Santa is real then let her believe so. If that’s what makes her happy then that’s okay.  I believe her presents should keep going along with it until she eventually stops believing it by herself.

  babies are considered innocent because I mean they just entire into this crazy life and have no idea what’s happening around them and so they haven’t made any mistakes or any bad decisions.  And people who are living in this world have experienced all the pain and negative emotions so they just become to be not innocent. The society changes them.

   But how do you stay positive but also be realistic about how the world is?  And what do you mean by living life to the fullest?  Do you mean make lots of money regardless of who it affects and what it's doing to the natural environment?
  ","
  oh believe me I’m not positive at all I just like spreading positivity even though I’m not positive. I just try my best to make people smile.  What I mean by live life to the fullest is to do the things you love in life and to go out of your comfort zone and to be happy and healthy.

   What do you think of people that abuse animals?

(If you do not feel comfortable with answering, you do not have to.)
(Use this question to vent how you feel. More than welcome to say whatever you'd like.)
  ","
  I hate/despise people who abuse animals. It’s like what did that poor innocent animal do to you?! it breaks my heart and tears me apart to know people abuse animals. I’m a huge animal lover and so when I hear that I just break apart.  Those animals haven’t done anything to deserve that. We are blessed to have animals in our world and in our homes. And we don’t deserve animals we truly don’t. They’re so loyal, loving and caring and some people treat them like they’re toys and that’s just messed up really 💔 I absolutely hate the fact people think they can hurt animals like that when they definitely don’t deserve that. 😭 it’s heart breaking.

  ","
  well I know we’ve  had ups and downs  mostly downs but it’s kinda strange how even after all of that we always somehow tend to find our way back to each other which is talking again and even though he goes and disappears and ignores me all over again I just feel I can forgive him. I definitely won’t forget but I can forgive him. I mean why would we find our way back to one another if we weren’t meant to be?¿ Like I wish I knew the answer to that. Anyways I still care about him and I know I shouldn’t care after all he’s done to me emotionally but I still do and I do wish him the best and I don’t know maybe one day he will realize what he lost. and I’ll always be here for him if he needs someone to talk to because I’m nice like that.

   😔 Secret of a happy friendship then?
  ","
  even most of my friendships ended badly like with my ex best friend and my other friend I considered best friend starting ignoring me. And the other people I considered friends stop talking to me because everyone gets tired of me.🤷‍♀️
  
  but you for example are a wonderful best friend. you actually care and want to see me happy and I appreciate that very much. You always try your best to make me smile and laugh. Also you’re always there when I need someone and for that I’m very thankful.  I don’t think you would ever ignore me or stop talking to me 🙂

  I don’t know what happiness is anymore. I haven’t felt that emotion in awhile now. But I think it’s living life to the fullest and getting out of your comfort zone and doing things you wouldn’t usually do. Spreading positivity and love to others along the way. And just enjoying your life.

   Why do we respect the dead more than the living?
  ","
  I believe we respect the dead more because people tend to start caring once someone is dead and they regret not being kinder or talking to that person while they were alive. It’s rather sad actually. You should have respected them while they were alive and treated them well. I think it’s mainly because they feel regretful and sorrowful that they didn’t treat that person right when they were alive.  It’s like they will start caring and say oh that person was so great when they’re dead but when they were alive they never really cared. We should respect the living and dead as well of course but don’t start respecting someone that you didn’t respect before just because they’re dead or care about them. That’s just sad🥺 I’ve seen that online with the legend Chester Bennington where people didn’t care or even listen to his music before but when he passed people were like he was so talented and such an amazing singer and I just thought to myself wow that’s sad you never cared about him or listened to his music when he was alive smh. That breaks my heart. 💔you should care and respect   someone when they’re alive and living on this world like 🥺 they deserve that much. It just breaks my heart really.

  well revenge is the action of actually inflicting harm or hurt on someone for an injury or something wrong they did and justice is the moral principle determining just conduct and so justice is different from revenge because justice is rightfulness or lawfulness as of a claim or title and that’s not inflicting hurt or harm on someone for something they did.

   Some people believe that if life has no purpose, then there is no reason for living.

Which side are you on?
  ","
  i honestly believe if life has no purpose that frees you to find or create a purpose and that will allow you to explore and experience so many things until you find your purpose in life. I disagree with if life has no purpose, then there is no reason for living because you were put on this world for a reason and that is to live it to the fullest and eventually in life you will find your passion and purpose. Also the first one makes me sad🥺

   Why are humans so confident in beliefs that can’t be proven? 🤔
  ","
  well because that’s what they’ve been told or that’s what they strongly believe even if it can’t be proven. That’s just how their thought process works and their minds tell them that it’s real so that’s why they feel so confident in their beliefs.

  oh yes i remember you asked this!😝 we have such a strong urge to distract ourselves from the real world because it’s sh*t and very bad right now and it’s better to not live in reality and to just live in your own fantasy dream land because this world is such a bad place that we live in today. It’s horrible so I can get why we distract ourselves from it.

   They probably think that the other person hurt them and they are paying them back for it, thinking it'll keep them from doing it again. Usually they reacted off a misunderstanding and their ""payback"" just strengthens the cycle of toxicity, but I think that's what motivates the behavior.

  I think it means to live it to the fullest and even though there’s going to be a lot of hard times in life you should always have positive thoughts and know that it will get better. To have a good life just means that you’re positive about the things that come your way and you deal with them positively even though it might be tough. You just set your mind set to think positively and then in life positive things will come your way and happen to you.

  "
990856,"
   Does a person’s name influence the person they become?

  no not necessarily. Its their environment that shapes them and makes them become who they’re. It’s also the people they’re surrounded by. Whoever they’re with and surrounded by shapes their personality into who they will later become in the future.

   Do you believe closure is important for mental health ?
  ","
  honestly yes I believe getting to close the book on your situation and the pain that’s associated with it is healthy. I believe especially in romantic relationships it’s always good that you and your ex can accept that the relationship is over and then you both can feel a sense of resolution. Also getting closure means you take responsibility for your actions in the relationship and you may feel guilty for ending the relationship but it also means that you may discover aspects of yourself, as expressed by by your former partner, that you may have otherwise chosen to ignore.

  i think society places such a high standard on beauty because they have a certain expatiation on how everyone should look.

I mean it does have purpose because with beauty people in this society can accomplish so many things.

  my mind never goes to sleep. It’s constantly on and all my thoughts keep me awake. Especially the thoughts about someone I wish I didn’t think about.
  "
991060,"
   Why are there so many people who are lonely? Why is it so hard for people to make real connections when almost everyone wants to make real connections? 🤔
  ","
  i believe so many people are lonely because everyone ends up leaving. Like the people they’re in relationships with will end up leaving and breaking their hearts and so they’re afraid to put themselves out there again because they know they will get hurt again. People are lonely nowadays because they’re afraid to put themselves out there because they got hurt once and they think they will get disappointed again.

   If science makes it possible to predict which people will be more likely to commit crimes, should the highest risk individuals be jailed or killed before they can commit crimes? 🤔
  ","
  I mean I don’t think it’s possible to predict who’s more likely to commit crimes 🤷‍♀️ but I think they should be in jail with very high security so that they can’t escape because killing them would give them more power in my opinion. They should sit and rot in jail for the rest of their lives so they can feel how it feels to suffer tbh

   What makes a person truly evil? Are they born that way or did their environment make them that way? 🤔
  ","
  I think a person can be evil by their actions and they way they show it on the outside and by their words meaning what they say to others. I don’t think they’re necessarily born evil I think it’s the environment that shapes them and and makes them act in a evil way. It’s their surroundings that shape them and make them that way.

  well if that was the case no would learn responsibility and no one would earn money for themselves to go out and buy things they would just get it for free. I don’t think that’s a good idea because people should work hard to get what they want and to learn responsibility and how the real world works.

  animals probably think to themselves what are those? lmao like they’re thinking what are those creatures and why do they look so different from us? Also they probably hate us for hurting them and love us for loving them and giving them homes and a enjoyable life.
  "
991358,"
   Why do humans have such a strong urge to distract ourselves from the real world?
  ","
  we have such a strong urge to distract ourselves from the real world because the real world is sh*t lol. It’s so hard and stressful and pure depressing. And it’s full of hate and negativity so I could see why we try so hard to distract ourselves from this sad world.
  "
991359,"
   Is it ever morally acceptable to limit the number of children a person can have if the consequences of overpopulation are that everybody suffers?
  ","
  I mean I don’t think anyone should tell anyone how many kids they could have. That should be the choice of the person having the kids. I get that we have overpopulation already but we shouldn’t tell someone how many kids they could have. That’s all up to them. And as those kids grow up in later generations you never know the world will be different and new careers will exist and those kids will change and shine in their generation.

  I do enjoy talking to my friends on here because all of them are so sweet and amazing but most of the time I don’t enjoy this app because it gets boring and because people hide on anonymous and talk shxt but it’s quite funny actually. You know that they only talk cause there’s anonymous. I would say ask should try and experiment for one day and get rid of the anonymous option and then you’ll see all the hate and negativity would stop because people wouldn’t be able to hide on anonymous 🙂 and so they would be scared to talk sh*t and badly about people. It would stop due to the no anonymous option. That would be a fun experiment lol

   If you killed someone, howwould you get rid of the body?
  ","
  well you would definitely have to get rid of the evidence so you don’t get caught. So maybe take them to a farm where they’re pigs because pigs would eat the body all up. And you have to get rid of the persons teeth because they can track it down and find out who it is from that. You would have to make sure each part of the body is eaten from the pigs and all gone. Or you can go to the middle of the ocean and drop the body that way no one will ever find it and wipe off your fingerprints get rid of their teeth and whatnot lol
