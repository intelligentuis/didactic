We lived in a three family before that so we were used to hearing noises at times. Mom and I were downstairs and we heard furniture moving. Like heavy stuff... The whole upstairs had nothing up there. Also heard footsteps like someone was going up or down the stairs. we noticed at the same time that it was obviously a ghost because nobody was up there, no furniture to be moved etc it was so freaky.\n  \n  My sister and her ex bf were there alone one day and they were going at it. Our grandpa hated him and I'm pretty sure the grandma wouldn't have approved because it was her old sewing room. The smoke detector in that room kept beeping.

I was sleeping, woke up then I saw it just sitting at the table. It was basically watching me. I sat up to get a better view. Then I felt weird like i couldn't move, couldn't say anything or scream.
