the united states has high rates of obesity, much more than most other countries, because there's this culture of \"bigger is better\" (meaning food). granted, i eat fast food perhaps *too* often because it's easier for me, but i'm always shocked at how large the burgers and drinks are. it's wild.\n  ","384297":"\n  yeah, where i live primarily consists of trump supporters.\n  ","384298":"\n  i wasn't necessarily pointing blame at the fast food restaurants in particular, but i do believe there may be a correlation, if somewhat stringent. with the fast-paced world we live in today, it's often much easier to eat fast food than cook meals at home.\n  ","384299":"\n  i never said it was. i'm fat, but i'm not terribly unhealthy considering i eat good meals. however, being obese does raise the risk of inheriting other serious health conditions.\n  ","384300":"\n  it isn't fatphobic to point out that the united states has probably the most fast food restaurants out of any other country (i'm assuming, i don't feel like looking it up rn though). the united states also has an alarming rate of people who are obese, which lends itself to a multitude of other serious health conditions.\n  ","384301":"\n  my best prediction is that because places started opening up again, people got more lenient and thought they were safe, which means they were less likely to practice social distancing and wear masks. it's also cold and flu season (at least in the united states and europe), so i expect that might have something to do with it as well.\n  ","384302":"\n  a dark

a better life for yourself after that. that's something of which to be proud.\n  ","384306":"\n  i wish i could have moved out that young, ahah. i was only able to afford my own place until after i

since then, especially with respect to work.\n  ","384309":"\n  there isn't really anything i would refuse to pay for, considering i only really buy the necessities that i need to survive & enjoy my

don't blame you, rofl.\n  ","384328":"\n  i understand. i sometimes struggle with low blood sugar if i don't eat every few hours, so i definitely needed something substantial besides the salad i had around 2:00pm.\n  ","384329":"\n  mainly celebrated the election of joe biden as the next president of the united states. obviously i did some essentials in between, like eating and showering and regular daily responsibilities, but the majority of my day was spent talking about the election.\n  ","384330":"\n  i'm sleeping in this shirt tonight, so i'd rather just throw the towel in the hamper

to 100% physically. i really think i just needed to eat something and take some pills, and the shower definitely did help.\n  ","384333":"\n  this is going to sound gross, but i didn't want to step away from my computer while watching the speeches in case i might miss something so i ended up using the towel that i have to dry my hair to wipe my nose (not blow into it, though), lmfao.\n  \n  it's okay -- i was planning on washing it tomorrow anyway. but the entire time, i was like, \"I CAN'T STEP AWAY FROM MY COMPUTER UNTIL THE SPEECHES ARE DONE.\"\n  ","384334":"\n  it has been a roller coaster of a day, my friend. i woke up this morning feeling a bit rough around the edges (i got too f*cked up last night), but ever since biden was deemed the president-elect, i've been feeling so elated, hopeful, inspired, and encouraged.\n  \n  in the middle of the afternoon, i started to feel *really* sh*tty physically -- i couldn't stop using the bathroom, i was very lightheaded and shaky, and i felt like i had a fever. but eventually it did subside, i was able to take a shower and eat dinner, and now i'm just reveling in the moment and having a few drinks.\n  ","384335":"\n  honestly, i'm better expressing my feelings via text than talking anyway, lol.\n  ","384336":"\n  when kamala harris was talking about her mother and family history, that got me choked up as well. especially when kamala said that this is pretty much only the beginning, and while she is the first woman to be in office, she most definitely won't be the last.\n  ","384337":"\n  if i do, it won't be of my face. however, i am home alone tonight so i'd be willing to respond via video to some questions.\n  ","384338":"\n  inspired, tbh. watching those speeches gave me renewed hope in this nation, and while i know what they're saying are just words for now, it makes a world of difference knowing that they're unified for a complete america -- not an america that's divided between red and blue.\n  \n  we have a lot of progress to do. there's so much left to undo and begin again, and so many issues left to tackle that were neglected under the trump administration, but i feel very hopeful right now.\n  ","384339":"\n  it wouldn't surprise me if he does.\n  ","384340":"\n  NOPE. i was elated this morning and teared up a bit, but it was more of a celebration than anything else. afterwards, when i heard that both kamala harris and biden were addressing the nation tonight, i tuned in and totally lost it. lmaoo.\n  ","384341":"\n  LOL, man i was sobbing so i totally feel you. kamala harris' speech got me choked up more than biden's speech, but when biden came out and mentioned the gay and trans communities, and how they *both* basically said that black americans were the backbone of this nation, i was in tears.\n  ","384342":"\n  i know exactly what you mean, dude. it's been four years of just ... nonsense, lies, insults, and narcissism. it got to the point where i couldn't watch trump's speeches because his voice just irritated me, so i'd read the transcripts afterwards.\n  \n  it feels weird, but also nice and amazing, to have a presidential team that is professional and eloquent. it's what we deserve.\n  ","384343":"\n  because my eyes are swollen, my nose is red, my hair is still wet & tangled, and my cheeks are pink because i've been drinking. lmaoo.\n

has a pattern of swapping between democratic and republican administrations every few years.\n  ","384400":"\n  well, no one knows for certain until it happens.\n  ","384401":"\n  no, probably not. i

that does make sense. even if biden loses pennsylvania if that's the case, he'll lose 20 electoral college votes which will still put him at 270 exactly.\n  ","384416":"\n  if that's true, then that's hilarious.\n  ","384417":"\n  i just checked trump's twitter page and he hasn't said a word in two hours prior to the announcement that biden will be the new president, lmao. i wonder if he's throwing a tantrum rn.\n  ","384418":"\n  oh wow, i didn't know that. i wonder if that still applies because of COVID, though -- that's my only question, since so many ballots were mail-in this time around.\n

to satisfy your attempts at trolling on such a beautiful day in american history. move along.\n  ","384424":"\n  you sound like the salty anon in my other thread. you do realize that under trump's administration, immigrants are *also* being isolated and ab*sed in cages by ICE and there are hundreds of displaced families, right?\n  ","384425":"\n  oh please, this isn't the time for this kind of

in this moment.\n  ","384426":"\n  she has a history of being a prosecutor in the legal system. regardless of that, times have changed. i'm not excusing her or biden for the wrongs they have done in

my opinion.\n  ","384460":"\n  this is going to sound a bit bizarre, but i look up to my ex the most out of pretty much everyone i know. our breakup was amicable and we're still on great terms, and i've always valued our friendship over the past decade. he's also an incredibly strong and resilient person who has endured a lot throughout his life, but has also managed to make the best out of every bad situation.\n  ","384461":"\n  a good friend is someone who supports all of your dreams and goals, but on the other end, isn't afraid to call you out for your behavior if you're doing something problematic or dangerous. there should be equal communication between friends.\n  ","384462":"\n  the normalcy of binge-drinking to the point where it's considered alcoholism, but people are too blind (or in denial) to see it. this is especially prevalent in the united states -- and i'm sure other countries too, but since i live in the US, this is where i see it the most.\n  \n  i know i'm not exempt from this either, considering i do drink most nights out of the week. but the fact that it's considered normalized in society is the scary part, that people are drinking on a daily basis and think that it's \"normal\" is a detriment to how we view health and wellness.\n  ","384463":"\n  \"why am i the way that i am?\"\n  \n  it's a question i posed to my therapist during one of our first meetings, because she asked me what i wanted to achieve in therapy. i described to her that i basically wanted to get to the root cause of all of my problems, which includes all of my repressed memories of the past and come to a better understanding of why i behave the way i do.\n  ","384464":"\n  my laptop, my vape, a bottle of wine, and a pot of coffee.\n  ","384465":"\n  when i

we later verified with my friend's parents).\n  \n  then while also using it, we both saw some sort of white apparition dart from one doorway to another from across the hall, which scared the sh*t out of us.\n  ","384467":"\n  video games, most definitely. as much as i love playing video games and eventually do want to try to stream or record videos with my friends, it would make us absolutely zero money, lol.\n  ","384468":"\n  ziplining has always been a goal of mine, especially if it's somewhere in the trees or mountains.\n  ","384469":"\n  i've been trying to devote more time to writing

games on occasion with my friends, which has been super fun.\n  ","384470":"\n  i understand that feeling all too well, haha. my dog when i lived at my parents' house was a rescue, but i didn't go to the place when my brother adopted her -- which in retrospect, was probably a good thing because i would have wanted them all. lmao.\n  ","384471":"\n  i love learning about medieval periods, especially as it pertains to nordic history.\n  ","384472":"\n  \"1984\" by george orwell really made me contemplate the society we live in the first time i read the book.\n  ","384473":"\n  feeling the cool breeze coming through my window while i'm working, lighting candles, having productive conversations with friends, having a cold beer at the end of a strenuous day, and playing video games with friends.\n  ","384474":"\n  in certain aspects, yes. on the rare occasion, i'm not humble (particularly when it comes to my writing).\n  ","384475":"\n  talk them through with someone close to you or a therapist and attain closure through a discussion of those feelings. that's the healthiest way to do it, at least.\n  ","384476":"\n  i'd probably just scream into the void.\n  ","384477":"\n  i do have to admit, even though eminem is a terrible human being, i still enjoy some of his music for nostalgia reasons.\n  ","384478":"\n  i just ignore it at this point. it isn't worth giving those people my time or energy.\n  ","384479":"\n  anchovies, most likely.\n  ","384480":"\n  i would 100% rescue a dog, probably an older dog because they're less likely to get adopted.\n  ","384481":"\n  i don't have a crush.\n  ","384482":"\n  going on a camping trip with my friends a few weeks ago was the most fun i've had so far this year. it was definitely worth it and much-needed to get away from

i normally feel most energetic around 10:00am to 11:00am. that's the probable time when i've had enough caffeine in me to fully wake me up, and i notice i get more work done in that hour compared to the rest of the day.\n  ","384487":"\n  i'm clingy and manipulative.\n  ","384488":"\n  i'm not much of a sports fan, so i don't have strong feelings for or against racket sports. i've never played tennis, but i have played badminton on a few occasions. it's been many, many years, though.\n  ","384489":"\n  i don't think COVID will ever be *completely* gone, and life will probably never return

as usual.\n  ","384490":"\n  BIG MOOD. \ud83d\ude2d\n  ","384491":"\n  it depends on the type of music they already like. in most cases, however, i like to recommend grandson, two feet, matt maeson,

i get home (or clock out of work considering the past eight months). i haven't felt compelled to read in a long time with the exception of a few occasions.\n  \n  i started reading \"fahrenheit 451\"

thing. i went camping for the first time a few weeks ago and it was such a great experience.\n  ","384497":"\n  i think a movie about my life prior to the age of 21 would be *much* more interesting than a movie about my life after i had turned 21, rofl.\n  ","384498":"\n  at this point, probably not. the way he has been conducting himself over the past year alone should have been enough to dissuade voters from voting for him, not to mention the obvious fact that he rolled back so many things that would have protected the lgbtq+ community, women's rights, and the general health and

rice books (i've read a few of king's short stories a few times and \"interview with the vampire\" twice).\n  \n  \"girl interrupted\" is another one of my favorites, by susanna kaysen. that has a lot

nearly nothing about european politics.\n  ","384551":"\n  no, i don't believe that. there are also so many ballots that have yet to be counted as well because there were so many mail-in ballots. we

things to quit.\n  ","384553":"\n  i knew smoking was dangerous from the very beginning. the main reason why i quit smoking cigarettes was because in the last year that i was smoking, i would wake up every morning with a hacking cough that would make me choke or dry heave, and i knew i needed to stop.\n  ","384554":"\n  that's interesting. that makes me question what happens to families who cannot afford an education in canada, considering it seems as if most jobs require higher education. then again, canadian universities are probably *much* cheaper than universities within the US, including community colleges.\n  ","384555":"\n  biden is leading at the moment, and there's a pretty decent chance that he'll win.\n  ","384556":"\n  interesting. so if someone is looking to immigrate to canada in order to pursue a better education than what is available in their native country, they cannot do so?\n  ","384557":"\n  contrary to popular belief, immigrants have actually created new job opportunities for americans because many immigrants start their own businesses and, in fact, pay taxes.\n  \n  as for the whole \"drug\" comment, even if someone *did* do drugs, that doesn't make them any less of a person because they're struggling with a substance use and mental health disorder. people who are drug users aren't \"inferior\" members of society, and we should erase the idea that they're not deserving of help.\n  ","384558":"\n  sure, i would make it so that i would have 20\/20 vision and wouldn't need prescription lenses anymore.\n  ","384559":"\n  i literally just answered your question.\n  ","384560":"\n  i don't believe so, no. the majority of immigrants come to the US to seek jobs and to seek asylum, and immigration is the basis upon which the US was founded.\n  \n  what should be focused on more are the displaced families in ICE camps who have been treated inhumanely, and the hundreds of children who have not been reunited with their parents.\n  ","384561":"\n  most likely, there would be greater understanding between humans and other animals (and probably less ab*se towards animals too).\n  ","384562":"\n  i haven't really thought about it much, tbh. i would eventually like to visit new zealand and iceland, though.\n  ","384563":"\n  yes, i have.\n  ","384564":"\n  candles, lmaoo. i finally dug out all of my candles from last year & ended up purchasing three more last week, so now i have a lot of candles.\n  ","384565":"\n  probably a bit more boring, considering several of the more \"controversial\" questions i get are from anons. if anonymous was taken away, there would be a lot less activity.\n  ","384566":"\n  probably 10 or so, ranging between boots and slip-ons and sandals.\n  ","384567":"\n  i really enjoyed visiting the american museum of natural history in new york city. i've been there a few times, and it's always a wonderful learning experience.\n  ","384568":"\n  i'm a decent driver, but also very cautious

more.\n  ","384570":"\n  when you asked me this question, i was home. i am, in fact, still very much at home.\n  ","384571":"\n  halloween is my favorite holiday, although i admittedly don't do much to celebrate it. i like hanging up purple & orange lights in the house and setting up some decor, but i don't do much other than that.\n  ","384572":"\n  neither, i don't like either of those shows.\n  ","384573":"\n  honestly, i think that POC deserve to have a greater platform to voice their disgust for people who claim to be POC and are actually white, because they have first-hand experience as to what it's like to be discriminated for being a POC.\n  \n  white people (doesn't necessarily have to be women, btw) should call out injustice when they see it too, but because they benefit from white privilege, the most they can do is offer their opinion. they have zero experience with being oppressed due to their race.\n  ","384574":"\n  raven is a single, solitary person on a dying website (i'm talking about askfm). obviously it's terrible to try to claim that you're a POC when you're actually white, but in the grand scheme of things, it's something that deserves very little of my attention.\n  ","384575":"\n  myself and my roommate.\n  ","384576":"\n  no, lol. i dislike trump, but hate is a very strong word that is only reserved for particular people.\n  ","384577":"\n  i really enjoyed all of the psychology, sociology, and anthropology classes i took. for about six months, i debated on changing my major to anthropology.\n  ","384578":"\n  i dropped off my absentee ballot last week, but prior to that, the last time i actually went to a polling place to vote was 4 years ago during the last presidential election.\n  ","384579":"\n  i haven't done anything wild for money, i've always just worked various jobs.\n  ","384580":"\n  i hate one person in my life, but that's all.\n  ","384581":"\n  it doesn't really mean much to me.\n  ","384582":"\n  continue living my life and dealing with problems as they arise, just like the past four years have been like.\n  ","384583":"\n  that i'm doing fine when i am, in fact, not fine at all.\n  ","384584":"\n  i didn't realize we went back in time to 5 years ago when people anonymously talked about one another just for the sake of drama.\n  \n  i couldn't care any less about what other people do or say on social media, unless they were a close friend of mine, of course. we're all adults now.\n  ","384585":"\n  when i was in school, i liked the process of continual learning -- sitting in lectures, having discussions, writing notes, and just having everything come together in one cohesive form.\n  ","384586":"\n  i would like to delve further into photography.\n  ","384587":"\n  i honestly don't have any strong opinions regarding social media because, although i use social media often, it doesn't encompass my entire life.\n  \n  although now that i do think about it, something that is a bit irritating is when people assume they know *all* about you based entirely on what you choose to post online. it's irrational thinking because people only post what they're comfortable posting, and it isn't 100% of who someone is.\n  ","384588":"\n  hm, interesting.\n  ","384589":"\n  i don't really have one. i like composers of various modern media, but they're not pianists.\n  ","384590":"\n  i write fairly well when i put my mind to it.\n  ","384591":"\n  in that case, then no -- i don't agree with that perspective. like i stated in my previous response, societal oppression is multifaceted and is based on several different factors -- not just class and the economy.\n  ","384592":"\n  it does make sense, and i don't really agree with that perspective. there's much more to social inequality than just class systems.\n  ","384593":"\n  do you mean native american food? then yeah, from my understanding most of the food that native americans have eaten include corn, beans, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, avocados, etc etc. basically all natural food that comes directly from the earth.\n  ","384594":"\n  i honestly have no idea -- i'm not educated enough on the subject of romani people.\n  ","384595":"\n  i can't really speak on what black men do or don't prioritize, considering i am not a black man, rofl.\n  ","384596":"\n  i would rather lose all of my money (i don't really have any valuables to begin with). i can make the money up week by week, but i cannot recover those pictures, and pictures are extremely meaningful to me.\n  ","384597":"\n  i don't remember much about hilary's platform, tbh. that was 4 years ago, lol.\n  ","384598":"\n  i don't really think wealth has anything to do with it, it's more of how much of a platform they have.\n  ","384599":"\n

the linkin park concerts i went to, tbh. the one that stands out in particular to me was when i went to projekt revolution in 2004 and saw linkin park and korn -- this was when i met linkin park as well. their 2007 projekt revolution lineup was also excellent -- linkin park, my chemical romance, taking back sunday, HIM, julien-k, and mindless self indulgence were some of the few bands performing.\n  ","384601":"\n  animals don't annoy me, including insects. i prefer animals over humans, rofl.\n  ","384602":"\n  neither, haha. i just like listening to music, and when i'm under the

from two feet, grandson, and linkin park to missio, korn, watsky, and NF. i also have ashnikko on the same playlist, as well as starset, matt maeson, blackbear, juice WRLD, badflower, cardi b, and corpse.\n  ","384611":"\n  i like psychological thrillers and fictional books with aspects of fantasy to them.\n  ","384612":"\n  my first date with my ex was to the movies and then we went out to dinner afterwards. we saw x-men origins: wolverine.\n  ","384613":"\n  i would probably still work part-time just to keep myself occupied.\n  ","384614":"\n  no, i've never ridden on or driven a motorcycle before. it isn't something i'm interested in much anyway.\n  ","384615":"\n  i think it's admirable that they're using their platform for the greater good and using their voice to speak out against injustice. no doubt they get a lot of backlash from some of their fans, but if the celebrity\/athlete is speaking for the right reasons, then it's worth it.\n  ","384616":"\n  i use snapchat regularly, but not really as a conversation app, if that makes sense. i just like sending snippets of my day to certain people on my friends list, and they'll send back snippets of their day. it's honestly mostly cat photos on my part, rofl.\n  ","384617":"\n  i used to really love bands such as def leppard, the rolling stones, the beatles, motley crue, and guns n' roses. however, i'm not really into that type of music much anymore.\n  ","384618":"\n  yeah, this defines a majority of my teenage years, and quite frankly, a lot of my adult years.\n  ","384619":"\n  no, i honestly only

","384622":"\n  no, i never have before.\n  ","384623":"\n  sure, i believe there can be multiple people out there for everyone. i don't believe in the concept of people having only one soul mate -- i think that we encounter multiple people in our lives who can enrich our lives in such a way that they touch our very souls, and this doesn't necessarily have to be in a romantic context.\n

interesting, but i don't think i would ever do it myself.\n  ","384627":"\n  yeah, that happens to me every once in a while too. it's just an involuntarily twitch -- possibly because of a muscle contraction in your body, or something similar. i wouldn't be very worried about it personally.\n  ","384628":"\n  yeah, i remember reading plenty of books when i was younger that had spelling or grammatical mistakes.\n  ","384629":"\n  waiting to use the computer because someone else in the house was on the phone.\n  ","384630":"\n  there are plenty of holidays i don't celebrate because it isn't a \"tradition\" for me (despite the fact that my family doesn't have many traditions to begin with), i.e. cultural holidays and celebrations that exist outside of my ethnicity or religion.\n  ","384631":"\n  for me personally, yeah. however, it's much different for some other people who place a greater emphasis on sex.\n  ","384632":"\n  i don't feel as if i have to prove anything to

therapist. it may take a bit to find someone with whom you feel comfortable, but they usually ask you questions about your life and that allows you to open up to them more.\n  ","384640":"\n  october, because it's autumnal weather and i like the ambience of halloween.\n  ","384641":"\n  the election & people voting today. i'm incredibly nervous and anxious, but i'm really happy to see so many of my

personally, the idea of \"living in the past\" means that a person cannot move on from their past mistakes or regrets, and that way of thinking is holding them back from progressing further in their life.\n  ","384647":"\n  chester bennington has always been a role model of mine ever since i was a teenager. linkin park's music was life-saving during those formative years, and i credit them and chester for keeping me motivated to continue living and progressing when all i wanted to do was d*e.\n  \n  even though chester passed away three years ago, i still consider him someone i hold in high regard, and i value all of the inspiration he and his music brought to me.\n  ","384648":"\n  to experience privilege is to have certain rights and advantages for being in a specific group compared to people who are not part of that group. white privilege, for example, exists because white people have always been oppressors in society who have undermined people of other races simply because they're not white.\n  ","384649":"\n  camping !! i went camping for the first time a few weeks ago & it was so incredibly fun.\n  ","384650":"\n  the only youtube channels i follow really are gaming channels, such as achievement hunter, seananners, chilledchaos, markiplier, and videogamedunkey.\n  ","384651":"\n  i honestly don't know anything about that. however, it's something i still believe, and i'm sure that the government (of not only the US, but obviously other countries as well) has the ability to keep things incredibly secretive if they choose to.\n  ","384652":"\n  i believe that the

suppose? i like watching twitch streams of my favorite gamers, and i also like discovering new people to watch as well.\n  ","384656":"\n  i'm not very confident that my privacy is being protected at all, but i don't post anything incriminating online, so it doesn't really bother me.\n  ","384657":"\n  perhaps a week or so? when i went on a cruise last february, i didn't have any service while we were on the ocean, so i couldn't access social media for the majority of the trip.\n  ","384658":"\n  i would rather be loved. money always comes and goes, and while money is necessary to survival, so is love, companionship, and support.\n  ","384659":"\n  i love my x-files hoodie, but unfortunately i don't have a photo of it.\n  ","384660":"\n  i've never tried hibachi before, although i've always

my favorite is probably strawberry banana or anything with peaches in it.\n  ","384667":"\n  smoking weed basically puts me to sleep within an hour of me smoking.\n  ","384668":"\n  i usually keep the

rifle or a hammer, but regardless, it's always fun to have a big group of people for more options.\n  ","384673":"\n  we did another one of those \"inner-child\" scenarios, which actually brought up some memories that i haven't thought about in years, so we discussed those memories and how they correlate to how i think & behave as an adult. it was a pretty productive session, and then i journaled for about 20 minutes afterwards.\n  ","384674":"\n  yeah, that's why myself & two of my other friends who are non-binary (and four men) were playing tonight, LOL.\n  ","384675":"\n  halo.\n

comfortable, they may open up.\n  ","384944":"\n  yes !! i played it a lot when i was younger & recently made a new world a few weeks ago, lol. i haven't played it much since then, though. i have sims

nearly empty, so y'all should ask me questions ~~\n  ","384958":"\n  people judge others based on the information they're given, which may not actually be indicative of who the other person actually is. also in some situations, people judge others based on their own pre-conceived judgments of those people -- they'll believe that the other person is x, y, and z because they want to believe that they are.\n  ","384959":"\n  it could be in certain circumstances, yes. it's pretty common for young students with higher intelligence levels to feel bored in classes at school, for example, because

well versed in either topic, but i would assume the prevalence of voter intimidation is much higher than voter fraud.\n  ","384962":"\n  yeah, that's still a really weird and unrealistic situation. that's the sort of thing that primarily happens in movies, rofl.\n  ","384963":"\n  no, rofl. i'm not going to travel to another country to meet someone else for the first time & live with them. i wouldn't be able to date or love someone unless i was physically with them from the very beginning.\n  \n  also ... i would want a job just to keep myself busy, even if money wasn't an issue. i can't envision myself *not* working a job.\n  ","384964":"\n  besides my job, i have nothing holding me to where i currently live. however, i would have to devise a plan (i.e. planning on housing situations, what kind of job i would get, etc etc). relocating somewhere else with a person you love unfortunately isn't as easy as it sounds.\n  ","384965":"\n  no, that sounds very uncomfortable and awkward. i wouldn't want the other people to feel as if i owe them, or something. i also don't have the time or money to do such a thing anyway, so it's a pretty unrealistic hypothetical.\n  ","384966":"\n  no, i don't have the time or money to do much traveling. i've only left the country once when i went on a cruise to the bahamas.\n  ","384967":"\n  i'm not sure where you're coming up with this statement, but i have not hung out with a dozen people in at least over a year. i only leave the house once per week, lol.\n  ","384968":"\n  i don't really have a lifestyle. i just work full time and basically stay home & keep to myself. occasionally, i'll do something artistic like paint, draw, or write, but most of the time i'm working and then relaxing with music and video games.\n  ","384969":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree, although i'm not sure what this has to do with me. rofl.\n  ","384970":"\n  thank you, i appreciate your concern. my independence after moving out of my parents' house last year has been amazing, and i've already grown and bettered myself so much since then. i could *never* move back into that sort of toxic environment again.\n  ","384971":"\n  very much so. my roommate and i hung up halloween lights throughout the house, ahah. on friday, we're going to package up some candy for the trick or treaters on halloween.\n  ","384972":"\n  both, unfortunately. i'm still recovering from the trauma of my younger experiences, and also, my parents still have a role in my life (particularly my mother). even after i moved out, she has still tried reeling me back in. on more than one occasion, she's asked if i was happy where i'm living now and asked me to move back in with her.\n  \n  it's just frustrating. i've slowly been distancing myself from my family (the last time i physically saw them was july), but every time i *do* talk to them, it's always the same old thing of \"when are you going to get tired of living there and move back in with us?\" ugh.\n  ","384973":"\n  i don't discuss my personal finances on the internet.\n  ","384974":"\n  eh, i don't really feel as if i have *true* freedom because i'm still always burdened by financial obligations, which keeps me situated in a place where i cannot afford to do things that i genuinely want to do.\n  \n  i'm not really sure what my own definition of freedom is, though. in the past, it used to be having an escape from my old household where i was under constant scrutiny & ab*se, but now that i'm mostly freed from that (unfortunately, not completely), i still feel a bit trapped at times.\n  ","384975":"\n  tbh, i probably wouldn't last very long, LOL.\n  ","384976":"\n  express yourself without fear of judgment, mind your own business and don't involve yourself in situations that have nothing to do with you, and engage in acts of self-care while keeping your best interests in mind.\n  ","384977":"\n  yes, absolutely. most often, these people aren't aware of it because they were raised in environments where mental health was not spoken about, so what is actually a mental health concern may be misconstrued by them as a character flaw.\n  ","384978":"\n  i don't believe i can affect the entire world obviously, but for me, i do try to share knowledge about the things i know to people who are willing to listen by using a platform (i.e. social media). i talk primarily about mental health, because i believe it's important to open lines of discussion of mental illness.\n  ","384979":"\n  or, we should normalize the line of thinking that there are a significant number of people who do struggle with mental illness, and mental health as a whole should be spoken about *more* often to erase the stigma associated with it.\n  \n  mental illness is just as important as physical illness -- to deny that fact is invalidating those who struggle with mental illness every day, and we still have a long way to go before mental health is taken seriously.\n  ","384980":"\n  most humans are naturally greedy and selfish, which often taints their views of the world and society, as well as how they act towards other people.\n  \n  i think one of the better ways to really \"solve\" or improve this issue is by constantly spreading knowledge, factual information, and logic. of course, some people will always remain steadfast in their close-mindedness, but trying to improve the world is better than doing nothing at all.\n  ","384981":"\n  this sounds like a complicated situation -- so basically, he asked you to marry him, and when you said you weren't ready yet, he broke up with you? that's honestly just ... bizarre.\n  \n  perhaps try talking to him again and gain a better understanding of why he wanted to break up. obviously you both love each other, and just because you don't feel ready now doesn't mean you won't feel ready in the future.\n  ","384982":"\n  this will probably always be one of my favorite videos ;\n  \n\n

used to like them a lot.\n  \n  i really love this stephen king vs. edgar allen poe (it has watsky in it!) ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=56R3hU-fWZY\n

a few times when i was much younger (late teen to young adult years).\n  ","384991":"\n  abandonment by my loved ones.\n  ","384992":"\n  no, i believe his actions and words sparked a global movement.

","385001":"\n  take my medication.\n  ","385002":"\n  of course not. several people have dietary restrictions and food sensitivities, and it would be against their wellness to enforce a vegetarian or vegan diet onto those people.\n  \n  also ... people have the freedom to eat whatever they want, lol.\n  ","385003":"\n  i never learned how to ride a bike, haha. however, my city is pretty big with a main street where a lot of the shops and restaurants are, so i think it would be easy for someone to get around by bike if they wanted.\n  ","385004":"\n  no, i'm not a journalist. i took journalism classes in college & realized it wasn't for me. i'd rather work behind the scenes.\n  ","385005":"\n  yeah, i've written press releases in the past for my current job before i took on the role of the managing editor of my job's magazine publication.\n  ","385006":"\n  most likely, yeah. sometimes i have a hard time with letting things go because i can't handle facing the reality of certain situations.\n  ","385007":"\n  i own it, but unfortunately i haven't read it yet. :\/\n  ","385008":"\n  i'm normally very wary of the news i see posted on social media, and i always check the source of the post before making a conclusion regarding the validity of the article. lately, i've been too busy and tired to cross-examine the news with different sources, but in general, i'm pretty vigilant.\n  ","385009":"\n  yes, i always cry when i watch the 2012 version of \"les miserables.\"\n  ","385010":"\n  my day has been all right. i honestly felt horrible for most of the day because i was hungover from drinking & smoking last night in excess, and i'm like 99% certain i had a weed hangover, rofl.\n  \n  however, i felt much better by late afternoon and then my roommate grilled us some cheeseburgers and fries for dinner. now i'm listening to bring me the horizon and checking up on social media.\n  ","385011":"\n  the first thought that enters my mind is that i should have spoken up against the ab*se that i was enduring as a teenager, but at the same time, it would have simply made things worse for me -- which is why i never said anything to begin with.\n  ","385012":"\n  for me, it's a tie between having a good sense of humor and being honest.\n  ","385013":"\n  this has been in my inbox for a while, and tbh, i can't think of anything that i've done that would be considered interesting. lol.\n  ","385014":"\n  i disagree with the idea of zoos because in most circumstances, the animals are treated very poorly. i'm not sure about how animals are

snacks in between meals, so idk.\n  ","385016":"\n  eh, not necessarily. trans men are men and trans women are women, so if you're a cis man who is heterosexual and you like a trans woman, you're still heterosexual because she's a woman.\n  \n  however, if you like someone and find out later on that they're trans and that dissuades you from pursuing that person further, that can be transphobic.\n  ","385017":"\n  oh, daylight savings, you mean?\n  \n  i think it's strange how daylight savings is different for various countries, tbh. i've also never really looked into the reason behind why we do it in the first place, though. i don't have much of an opinion.\n  ","385018":"\n  i haven't been to many places, but i feel like i would exist well in either northern new england, the pacific northwest, or somewhere down in the carolinas. i would ideally have the same job as i have now, or some sort of freelance writing position.\n  \n  as for a house, i can honestly just envision myself living in a quaint apartment.\n  ","385019":"\n  uh ... i'm not quite sure what you mean by \"time change\"? time is a construct, ahah.\n  ","385020":"\n  i think it's easier to hate someone than to love someone, tbh. that's why there's so much hatred and greed and selfishness in the world.\n  ","385021":"\n  yes, that's quite common for people who are insecure (or honestly, people in general). i don't necessarily believe other people when they compliment me on certain things, and in my worst states of mind, it makes me feel as if they're doing it out of pity.\n

really bring that spark back. him and i are on great terms and we talk often still.\n  ","385098":"\n  yeah, you should be honest with those around you.\n  ","385099":"\n  i was miserable for months after him and i broke up (and honestly, i'm still sensitive about it all). what did give me some guidance through it was when i moved out of my parents' house a few months after him and i broke up.\n  ","385100":"\n  not massive, no.\n  ","385101":"\n  i haven't had caffeine all day, so it was a caffeine withdrawal headache.\n  ","385102":"\n  mayonnaise.\n  ","385103":"\n  definitely not me, that's for sure. lmfao.\n  ","385104":"\n  askfm is for asking & answering questions, not for making friends. if you have a question, feel free to ask though.\n  ","385105":"\n  i woke up from a nap not too long ago and had a horrible headache, and i just drank some iced tea for the caffeine & feel much better.\n  ","385106":"\n  hello \u2014 do you have a question?\n  ","385107":"\n  perhaps. like i said, it isn't important to me rn.\n  ","385108":"\n  it isn't important to me rn.\n  ","385109":"\n  i'm tipsy, but apparently i can still draw eyes fairly well ~~\n  ","385110":"\n  hello \u2014 do you have a question?\n  ","385111":"\n  hello, i am tipsy and feeling great.\n  ","385112":"\n  i've always found it difficult to do makeup on other people, LOL.\n  ","385113":"\n  i'm currently looking after two cats. :'))\n  ","385114":"\n  not usually, no.\n  ","385115":"\n  rose gold.\n  ","385116":"\n  yes, i feel much more comfortable when things are organized and tidy. i usually try to clean and organize things every day.\n  ","385117":"\n  my ex and i dressed like sugar skulls for halloween back in, like, 2014 or so. i understand this is cultural appropriation now, but i didn't understand it back then.\n  ","385118":"\n  this was so sweet to come home to !! thank you !! you're the sweetest, kittie.\n  ","385119":"\n  no, not at all.\n  ","385120":"\n  we went out to eat, and then we went to see a movie. it was really sweet, actually. we had burgers and milkshakes, and then we saw one of the wolverine movies that had just come out.\n  ","385121":"\n  can't relate.\n  ","385122":"\n  \"we accept the love we think we deserve.\"\n  ","385123":"\n  every few days, probably. they're not usually pictures of myself, though.\n  ","385124":"\n  alcohol, weed,

idk, i'm not really interested in relationships rn.\n  ","385128":"\n  i love garlic bread.\n  ","385129":"\n  yeah, that would be a pleasant change.\n  ","385130":"\n  productive.\n  ","385131":"\n  my new wine glass is so pretty ~~\n  ","385132":"\n  idk, i'm not much into fashion. i feel most confident in one particular outfit, though -- ripped up red plaid leggings, combat boots, a black tank top with lace on the bottom, and some sort of zip-up hoodie over it.\n  ","385133":"\n  kinda the same thing as a family thanksgiving, except it's with our group of friends instead of our families.\n  ","385134":"\n  i don't like thanksgiving. although last year, my friends and i started doing \"friendsgiving,\" which is a lot more fun.\n  ","385135":"\n  no, i haven't. i don't really do that sort of thing because trying to go out east on the weekends this time of year is absolute chaos.\n  ","385136":"\n  depends on the views and whether or not i'm even aware of those views in the first place, lol. for example, i won't eat from chick-fil-a because they're extremely homophobic.\n  ","385137":"\n  depends on how many people are boycotting, tbh. i wouldn't imagine it would do much if it's a billion dollar corporation, but everyone has the freedom to choose not to give their money to a corporation\/company that has viewpoints that are problematic.\n  ","385138":"\n  okay, this is rly off

is crying every day, they're most likely depressed and need medical attention.\n  ","385142":"\n  personality is more important, by far. how physically attractive someone is can only take them so far.\n  ","385143":"\n  i'm surprisingly good at games of deception, i.e. poker and especially now \"among us,\" LOL. no one ever suspects that i'm the imposter. :'))\n  ","385144":"\n  i don't partake in office politics.\n  ","385145":"\n  i'm a writer & editor for a publishing company. i mainly supervise my company's quarterly magazine publication, including writing or proofreading the articles, getting editorial ads together, making indexes, writing the editor's note, etc etc. i also administer to my company's online newsletters.\n  ","385146":"\n  when did i say politics are bad?

bahamas, simply because there wasn't any service unless we were on land.\n  ","385149":"\n  i have notifications turned on for askfm on my phone, but not my desktop.\n  ","385150":"\n  yeah, and that's primarily apps on the cell phone, not necessarily computer-based websites. 10 years ago, i was in college and my primary form of communication with people were over text\/phone call\/oovoo and i also used forums.\n  \n  i *think* that was also around the same time facebook was starting to become popular, but i don't really remember.\n  ","385151":"\n  no, the internet was booming 10 years ago.\n  ","385152":"\n  no, i haven't been to a party.\n  ","385153":"\n  yes, toxic masculinity is extremely prevalent in society.\n  ","385154":"\n  i just went to the store to try to find a rack that i can put in the kitchen for more storage, and i came home with a 1.5-foot long lighter in the shape of a giant match. lmfaoo.\n  \n  i wanted a candle lighter, but this will do the trick just fine.\n  ","385155":"\n  perhaps if i was more in shape, yeah.\n  ","385156":"\n  it's been fine thus far. i haven't done much since i've only been awake for around two hours, lol. i plan on cleaning the rest of the house later on this afternoon, but that's the extent of my plans for today.\n  ","385157":"\n  i've taken a few steps toward achieving my goals. i finally have a job in my chosen industry (writing and publishing), and i've been living independently for over a year now.\n  ","385158":"\n  i woke up around 11:00am, had breakfast and made coffee, and now i'm drinking coffee and perusing social media. i also just quickly vacuumed and swiffered the kitchen floor too. last night, my roommate accidentally dropped a thermos of iced coffee (luckily it was just black coffee) so i wanted to clean it up before anything happened.\n  ","385159":"\n  they're probably referring to the fact that i have a job that i enjoy -- that's really the only thing i can think of, and my job isn't even luxurious, lmaoo. i'm not even making enough money for what people *should* make for what i do.\n  \n  (which really, is an indication that i should find a new job, especially with all the bullsh*t that's been going down. but i love my job itself & my coworkers too much to resign, bleh.)\n  ","385160":"\n  my job has been occupying my mind a lot lately because of all the turmoil going on within the company. people are being laid off, sales are dropping, they cut our salaries across the board... it's been chaos. :\/\n  ","385161":"\n  not many people can, tbh. that's why i opted to rent a house with two other people as opposed to renting a one-bedroom apartment by myself. it's entirely unrealistic.\n  ","385162":"\n  no, the only health issues i struggle with are related to mental health.\n  ","385163":"\n  i guess so? lol.\n  ","385164":"\n  basic skills such as how to budget my finances, how to write a check, how to check the oil and other things in my car, how to put gas in my car, how to apply for a loan, how to apply for a job, etc etc. i basically had to self-teach all of these things.\n  ","385165":"\n  i used to believe in karma and fate when i was much younger (like pre-teen to teenage years). these days as an adult, i don't believe in those things anymore.\n  ","385166":"\n  i can write eloquently when necessary, but social media doesn't fall under that \"necessary\" category.\n  ","385167":"\n  how so?\n  ","385168":"\n  i have never portrayed to live a luxurious life on the internet, rofl.\n  ","385169":"\n  last night, i had a dream that like ... there were a bunch of us hanging around a small community where the houses were very close together, and there was one adjoining property next to where my parents live that my friends and i would go to chill. there were stairs leading up to a garden on the roof of the property that was encased in screens so that bugs couldn't get in, and we were preparing for a large party that night.\n  \n  i don't remember much else, but it was certainly weird.\n  ","385170":"\n  i suppose so, it's an average suburban house.\n  ","385171":"\n  because suitable housing is considered a privilege and a luxury in the united states, not a right.\n  ","385172":"\n  i couldn't care less about how i type\/write on social media -- social media is a place where i relax, and half the time when i use askfm, i'm not even sober. LOL.\n  ","385173":"\n  i've always thought the legend itself was interesting, and in fact, the first time i heard about it was when i watched the marble hornets videos on youtube years upon years ago.\n  \n  the event of the young girls m*rdering their friend based on the slenderman story really shocked, but also interested, me ... simply because i'm very much into crime stories, haha.\n  ","385174":"\n  my current job is great for me, even though the company is going through a lot of chaos rn. i thoroughly enjoy what i do.\n  ","385175":"\n  taking care of my own emotional and physical needs, bleh.\n  ","385176":"\n  i also type in all lowercase on social media, rofl. how i type on social media isn't an indication of how i write professionally and creatively.\n  ","385177":"\n  my only talent is in writing.\n  ","385178":"\n  i like crispy chicken sandwiches with lettuce and tomato.\n  ","385179":"\n  absolutely not. circuses are terrible places for animals because they get neglected & ab* sed on a regular basis. animals shouldn't be hurt for the entertainment of humans.\n  ","385180":"\n  i'm not sure if i want children.\n  ","385181":"\n  i slept for a solid 10 hours straight, LOL. i feel really groggy and hazy rn, so i'm hoping the coffee i just made will fix that.\n  \n  otherwise, i feel okay. i'm going out to brunch tomorrow with a friend, which should be fun.\n  ","385182":"\n  i've never had any traditions to follow.\n  ","385183":"\n  my friend invited me over their house for halloween, but i'm not sure if i even want to go, haha.\n  ","385184":"\n  yeah, new york (at least the city and long island) is extremely expensive. in my region, you're lucky to find a one-bedroom apartment for less than $1300\/month that isn't in a person's basement. it averages around $1500\/month for a one-bedroom apartment around here.\n  \n  houses, on the other hand, normally go for $500,000 or so if you're looking to buy, and these are just regular ranches.\n  ","385185":"\n  a driving instructor.\n  ","385186":"\n  slenderman.\n  ","385187":"\n  ayo, ask me questions !!\n  \n  i have some left in my inbox, but i feel like answering new stuff ~~\n  ","385188":"\n  i ain't chasing anything. i'm way too fat for that nonsense.\n  ","385189":"\n  pretty much any of the deaths from game of thrones, they were brilliant.\n  ","385190":"\n  pretty much 24\/7.\n  ","385191":"\n  i went to austin, texas, in 2014 for a video game convention, and the city itself was so cute and eclectic.\n  ","385192":"\n  i don't really do any halloween or autumn activities. my area is really big into the pumpkin patches, farm stands, apple cider tastings, etc. i don't do any of those things.\n  ","385193":"\n  i prefer day time because i like the prospect of waking up early and getting productive things done throughout the day.\n  \n  however, i do still love the night time because it's when i relax.\n  ","385194":"\n  i don't like scary movies, but i do enjoy psychological thrillers and gore movies.\n  ","385195":"\n  abandonment and enclosed spaces.\n  ","385196":"\n  i love stories about the chupacabra.\n  ","385197":"\n  no, i'm not superstitious at all.\n  ","385198":"\n  teleportation !! i wouldn't have to drive anywhere if i needed to go someplace, which would make my life so much easier.\n  ","385199":"\n  wendigos.\n  ","385200":"\n  i don't eat candy.\n  ","385201":"\n  yes. :\/ i'm usually very anxious and jumpy, and i also can't handle most horror movies because they make me super paranoid.\n  ","385202":"\n  autumn is my favorite season. :'))\n  ","385203":"\n  i got high and fell asleep super early last night, and forgot to put the garbage out. whoops.\n  ","385204":"\n  i would love to travel. i just don't have that sort of money or available time to do so.\n  ","385205":"\n  -- publish a book or a collection of short stories.\n  \n  -- move into a house or apartment on my own.\n  \n  -- adopt a lot of dogs.\n  \n  -- travel.\n  \n  -- progress further in my career.\n  \n  -- progress further in my mental health recovery.\n  ","385206":"\n  i believe it was in february when i went on the cruise. i didn't have service, so i left my phone in the room most of the day for that entire week except for when i wanted to take photos.\n  "}}
