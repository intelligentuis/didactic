   If your other half did something that upset you, and continued to do it even after you told her it upsets you, how would you feel?
  ","
  My husband does that a lot. There are more ways to communicate than with words. My man needs to think over things on his own time, so I will write him little notes or letters. He responds to them very well. Much better than when I try to come at him with words. He can get defensive and I recognize that, so I do what I can to help him out while helping myself in the process.
  
  Get creative with expressing your feelings to her! :)

   Should jewelery be worn in the pool?

  Personally, I would only go into the pool with my ring on. If I wasn’t dipping my face/head in, maybe some earrings, but not dangly ones.. I feel like one shouldn’t wear anything fake that could turn their skin green. Like Cheryl Lynn would say, it’s got to be real. Unless you’re shooting a music video, I don’t think excessive amounts of jewelry are necessary.

  We lived in the same city, but about 20 minutes away from each other. Not too far, but far enough. I had to set boundaries with her and let her know that I needed space. I recommend writing a letter to her about everything that is bothering you with your relationship. Leave nothing out. Hopefully she will respect it. If you need someone to read it out for comments/critique before you give it to her, try to find someone... again, someone who is trusted.

   i often wonder, how to be in a good relationship w/ my mom. it's like i'm never enough & it's hard to say she ❤ me. evenif she must be. but, she always complaining about me to dad. & dad who usually take my side now not anymore. my mom blames me 4 everything if my dad upset. i'm sad, 've tried talk.
  ","
  Do you live with them? If you’re underage, I’d talk to someone else about what’s going on like a counselor or other trusted adult if you can.
  
  If you’re within legal age, I’d suggest saving up and moving out ASAP.
  
  Sometimes absence makes the heart grow fonder.
  
  When I lived with my mom we were constantly at each other’s necks. I moved in with other family at age 16 and 10 years later, we are closer than we’ve ever been.

  ","
  Less respectful, less educated, less patient.
  
  I don’t necessarily think people have become “more sensitive” like everyone is saying. People have a platform now. The internet. Anybody can say anything they want. Before, people would just talk shit alone or to their like-minded friends and usually keep quiet to those outside of their circle. The internet has totally messed with people’s heads. Giving the ignorant the chance to spread hate and “troll” if you will. However, the internet has also connected people from around the world, formed bonds and communications that were otherwise unheard of unless you had money to travel. It has also help spread awareness for causes and helps everyone get a better understanding of what’s really happening in this world.  It’s the best and worst invention in history.
  
  In my opinion of course.

858481,"
   Maybe your friend loves bad boys so she can generate sympathy from others.
  ","
  If you’re talking about my story, it was my cousin. She would isolate herself after she met these men. Sometimes we didn’t hear from her for years. I think if she was looking for sympathy, she would have stuck around us to spill all the tea. Truth is, she was dealing with some inner demons + having low confidence about herself. That can equal disastrous results.
  
  If you’re talking about your friend, it sounds a lot like Munchausen syndrome which is what Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s mother had. Google her if you don’t know who I’m talking about. If she is always talking about it and needing that attention, she needs therapy.
  "
858482,"
   When you go to a movie, do you like to sit in the back, middle, or front?

  That all depends on how many people are in the theater, who I’m with, etc. I usually like to sit in that front row of the middle, where the metal bars are so I can prop my feet up. If I’m with a friend, I let them choose where they want to sit.
  "
858483,"
   Would you warn your son against marrying a woman that has 3 kids from 3 men and was divorced 3 times?
  ","
  This is a hard one. I have a son (luckily he’s a toddler for now)
  
  I also had a family member who had been married 4 times. She only had kids from 2 of the men however. BUT all of the men she was married to were abusive. She literally couldn’t catch a break. She’s since passed away about 8 years ago. So I think I’d go into that situation (if it arises) with a different perspective, I would however let my son know to be cautious.... in a lot of situations it is the woman who has the problem, but I would also encourage him to try and get her side of the story. I’d also suggest he look into her more... I mean we have the technology. I know that when I would go out with guys, I would make sure I’d look them up first (social media, etc) to try and get a sense of them, their friends, family, personality, etc. I think everyone should do that. You never know these days.

  No thank you please. This chick has made a Tumblr and dedicated her time and energy on someone who doesn’t give two shits about her? Yikes. The few pieces I did read I felt bad, he treated this chick like shit. Seeing as how there are billions of people in this world, there are going to be a lot of shitty ones in it. That’s sucks she didn’t come forward with the physical harm, I can relate to that. But making a whole damn page about her shitty exes? I saw there was another ex she wrote about but didn’t feel like diving deeper. Maybe she needs to stay single for a while and figure out how to be a stronger individual. I was in a string of shitty relationships and I had to eventually stop and learn to love myself before I could love someone else. When you accept abuse of any kind from anyone, that’s some deep mental thoughts that subconsciously tell you that that’s all you deserve. I recommend a therapist and some time alone to reflect.

  If you are the father and don’t feel like paying for something you helped create, sign away your parental rights.
  
  If you are the father, want to keep your parental rights but don’t want to pay to support your child’s wellbeing, yikes. Maybe you aren’t mature enough to have sex since you can’t take responsibility for your actions.
  
  Accidents do happen.
  
  You need to be prepared.
  
  If you are the father, want to keep your parental rights but don’t have the money, do your best!
  
  If you aren’t the father, you have nothing to worry about... keep living your life!
  
  HOWEVER, if the situation is switched and the father is taking care of the child, unless the mother signs away her parental rights, she needs to pay that child support.
  
  Remember, it takes two to tango.

  I’ll probably get hate for this but IDGAF - America has always been trash. We pride ourselves on our guns and other firepower. We have the biggest egos and the smallest dicks. Hate weakens us but we keep pressing forward. Our government has never listened to the country as a whole. Only to the rich or radical, not to the everyday folks trying to make it through another day. And before anyone comes for me and says “If you don’t like it then leave” which was once the polar opposite of what we originally stood for, I’m TRYING to leave eventually. But because money is only worthy for the rich, my family doesn’t get paid enough to barely float above water and pay our bills... I can’t even think about saving to get up and leave right now. If anyone wants me to leave because of my views they are MORE than welcome to fund our move ✌🏽 $toureluxurious

  ‘Alien’ is a funny word. We use it in a sense of ‘aliens’ for people in other countries meaning those who are not like us. So it’s not the question of believing, it’s the question of whether I think there are life on other planets, which I do. I think those who think we are the only life in this entire universe are idiots. We have yet to explore all of space, there are more planets out there that we can count. We simply can’t be alone out here. I refuse to believe  that we are just floating around completely alone. I mean, we haven’t even explored all of our own oceans! There’s always new things to discover.

   What is your favorite and least favorite thing about your country?
  ","
  My favorite thing: Is the minimum wage where I live. It’s very generous.
  
  My least favorite: There are so many. The length of maternity leave, our current president, our screwed up healthcare, how divided we are as a country (conservative/liberal) and how only one side can be right which is bogus. How little teachers get paid, I can go on.
  
  This is something I never like to talk about out loud because people can’t state their opinion without being attacked for it... I’m just going to assume that whoever asked this question hopefully just asked for the sake of asking and not a debate, because mama does not have the energy for that.
  
  All in all, when I see comments about “If you don’t like it then leave” is exactly why I don’t like this country more than like it. People don’t even bother being polite anymore. But they might be right, why would I want to share a country with a bunch of people who want to kick you out as soon as you let em know you have different views than they do.
  
  This country is awesome, but it has a lot of work and damage control to do stemming back a lot of years.
  
  That’s all I’m song to say about that.

  There are so many great commercials. I miss the old IKEA commercials.
  
  “Don’t jump on the bed
  
  Don’t jump on the bed
  
  Don’t jump on the bed
  
  Don’t jump on the bed
  
  Mom can I have a cookie
  
  Mom can I have a cookie

  Mom can I have a cookie”
  
  I’ll probs never see that commercial again. But it will always be ingrained in my head.
  
  I think I actually prefer commercials to some of the tv shows.

  Well at least you told her. But she’s your past, not your present. It’s okay that she feels that way, it’s normal. I know it sucks now, but you were truthful with her and that’s what matters. You need to try and focus on the present/future. Easier said than done, but take comfort in the fact that now it’s no longer a secret and you were honest about it. Now you can grow from the situation and hopefully not do that again with future relationships..

  No. I think a lot of people years and years ago just stayed with one person forever whether they loved them or not because it was tradition or shameful to be a divorcee especially for women. I know my grandma stayed with my grandpa even through the cheating because her parents thought it was disgraceful to leave her post as a wife. She said though, when he divorced her, that’s truly when her life began. So I think if two people love each other and it holds strong for the rest of their lives, then that’s wonderful and maybe even rarer than people think. IMO.

   Advice for anyone in a abusive relationship?
  ","
  Well first you need to make a plan for how you’re going to get out. Because you need to. If you’re being controlled and have limited access to money, make sure the money you do get you save it and hide it away. While you’re saving up this money, mentally plan what you’re going to take with you, I suggest a backpack worth of ONLY essentials. You can get your other stuff later with a police officer or someone you trust. Also make sure the timing is right to leave, if they lock you inside when they leave, make sure they are FULLY GONE from the house and break a window to get out. If you have zero access to money, as soon as you find a way to leave, go to a trusted person’s place... if you are isolated and don’t know anyone, the police is going to be your best bet even though I’m a little iffy with them (bad experiences). While you’re planning your escape, don’t act suspicious, that’s probably the number one way to have your plan ruined. If you have money but don’t want to go to the cops yet or at all, make sure you have enough money for a ticket of some kind if you know no one in your town/city and get the hell out of there. Basically my advice is to get out as quickly as possible.

  Pick goals on how you wanna be better. Don’t try to hop on all of it at once, that’s too much.

For example, one of my goals this year was to drink more water because I need to for my health. I think of WHY I’m doing it... Because if I don’t, my health will decline again and I want my son to have a mother. Your WHY reason is very important. Remember your why.

  They are both classified as relationships, but to me a committed relationship of love between two people (or however many you happen to have) involves sex. Friendship in my opinion does not include sex... but if there is a friend who you have sex with, it is not only a friendship but a fuck buddy as well🤷🏽‍♀️ a twofer 😂

   Many women in America seem to have no value for men.Why is this true ?
  ","
  You are asking “Why is this true?” Instead of “Is this true for all women In America?” And the answer is no. A lot of women base their opinion of men on past experiences of men... but then again a lot of men do that about women. However, it seems to me that whatever guy is posting these things seems to have already made up their mind about women from America, in which case I don’t see any benefit of me trying to convince you otherwise because of the already twisted, close-minded views that you currently have.

   my bf and i have been dating for 2 months and it feels right to have sex with him, but would it be too soon in our relationship?
  ","
  Well I’d say “When you’re ready” but the fact that you’re asking others if you’re ready, for one I’m guessing (just guessing) that you’re on the younger side so I’d wait. Also, if you have to ask other people who are not involved in your relationship if it’s the right time, it’s probs not the right time. Essentially you know your body and you will know when you are ready to have sex with your boyfriend. You are going to either have sex now or wait no matter what anyone says. It’s never up to anyone else but YOU. Remember that.

   Many professors can't explain whether soul  exists as such, and if it exists, then what is it and where is it located. Do you think there is soul and if so, where is it located?

  IMO: I think that the soul is a creature’s life force. The soul rests within the entire body. When the soul is ready to leave, the heart stops beating and then the body dies. We are not just our bodies, we are so much more than that.

  As a mother, I would be super sad if my child didn’t want to visit me for the holidays (he’s 1 so that won’t happen for a while lol)
  
  HOWEVER
  
  From a person who also likes to have independence from their family on holiday, I get it. I’d tell her that you just honestly want to spend Christmas alone. You don’t want to offend her because you love her, but you need time for yourself.
  
  She loves you and for that reason, she will understand. She may be a little sad, but then again it’s just probably going to happen and you need to prepare yourself for it.

  If he doesn’t want to be with you because of that... it’s not worth it honestly. Hard truth. Sometimes people want other people within their own religion and that’s okay. It may actually not work out in the future if there are problems with that now.... I was in a situation like that before. it might work out but that’s only if you’re both willing to both work it out.

Study for years on a subject that you are passionate about, only to get in a classroom of a bunch of rude ass kids who don’t have any respect for you. Students complain about their teachers, but they only have to deal with a few. A teacher, (especially high school teachers) have to deal with around 25 kids PER CLASS. Gotta be strong af to do that.

  We are getting too comfortable with violence/death/etc.
  
  I mean I live for horror movies and am studying to become a mortician... however.
  
  The world is just becoming scarier and scarier because of people “playing god” and taking lives for the fun or fame of it.
  
  People are getting beat up for no good reason at all.
  
  In my area, we have cat killers that have not been caught, have killed/mutilated at least 13 cats and there are no leads. Information to their arrest is up to $46,000 and reportedly rising.
  
  Bad things have always happened and maybe it’s just because more atrocities are being put out there in the media... I don’t know. Either way, we as a society are getting worse... we don’t care about each other, we don’t care about keeping our planet alive which a healthy planet means healthier people and more generations getting to grow and thrive.
  
  Nothing really makes sense anymore.
  
  Sorry for the ramble! Didn’t know I felt so strongly about this 🤷🏽‍♀️

He had brown curly hair and a temper.

After that, getting stoned in a hot shower. However, that was before I had a child. Now I wake up to soggy diaper butt in my face. As far as breakfast goes, I’ll grab a granola bar or something... maybe I’ll get a shower that night. But it’s okay, he’s cute so he can get away with it.

  Today, I plan on experimenting with making things out of ice outside. Yesterday I filled a ton of silicon molds with water and left them outside to freeze. Today I want to see what the quality of them ended up being, to decide what I should do.
  
  The ones sitting outside right now are ""trial"" pieces. Just to see how it ends up working out. If it goes well (I hope it will), I plan on re-filling them all with colored water to make an array of different colored ice shapes. From there, my project plan is to make a small hut / igloo for the local squirrels that come to visit!

   What advice you would give to someone who think their self worth is linked with how many likes they get?
  ","
  This is a really tough thing to overcome, and I understand it well. The first thing I would do to approach this issue is check the notification settings in each app you post on. A lot of apps nowadays are making more specific, separate notification sliders for interaction types. If you see any notification sliders for likes, Turn Them Off. This will help keep you from coming back to check and obsess every time you might get one.
  
  Coupled with this, you have to force yourself to do the hardest (and I know, it sounds most obvious) thing: don't bother checking back on your posts. If you're doing things that make you happy, just keep looking forward onto the next thing to post! And then the next. Just don't keep turning back, because you can end up over analyzing and over criticizing yourself.
  
  Every time you get the urge to check, practice mindfulness and awareness. Tell yourself, ""this is an urge coming from the self conscious part of my mind, and I won't get better if I keep entertaining it"". Set your phone down and carry on with your day. You deserve better from yourself than to keep yourself spiraling down that stressful, anxious path!

You should never have to explain to a grown, sęxuaIIy active adult that using a frigging BALLOON as a CÓNDOM is unsafe. And the fact that he got mad at being turned down from sęx, even without context, that's toxic.
  
  Do yourself a favor and find a new one.. this ain't it...

   How do you feel about child bearing in these times?
  ","
  My stance on having kids has always been and will always be the same: I don't want any, and I want nothing to do with any.
  
  If you mean my thought process about other people having children during the pandemic (¿if I'm assuming correct?) — NOT MY BUSINESS. No one else's business but the person's involved with creating the child, and providing for the child frankly.

   I, unexpectedly, fell in love with someone who is taken.. they fell in love with me too but they are having a hard time detaching from their current. The current has obviously noticed something is off bc now they act like they want the relationship.  Give us some advice pls...
  ","
  I mean the only thing to say is the obvious. If the person you are in love with isn't poly / their partner isn't okay with them having other partners.. they need to dump their partner. It's a really shıtty thing of them to do — stringing their current partner around on the side while they dabble in interest with you. Thusly stringing you around as well.
  
  If they aren't willing to end it, but they still wanna keep you on the side, you should end the ""relationship"" you have with this person. They're indecisive, and likely just enjoy the attention with no real motives for solid commitment if that's the case.
  
  I mean I wouldn't even touch this situation (or the person it's surrounding) personally. People like that tend to be fickle hearted. The possibility of them tiring of you the way they are tiring of their current eventually is a possibility with these types. Just my two cents!

   Paul McCartney said: ""If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian."" What do you think about it?
  ","
  I feel like it's a really powerful quote, and it shines a light on how most animal products are ""gathered"" (using this word loosely) in an inhumane way. It's a really important issue, and I do believe that people should have awareness of how most of these places operate. And it really is terrible, how cruel we can be.
  
  BUT... I wanted to bring this up because it feels relevant to my closing point. In high school, they had this ""health ed"" spokesperson come in one day during our Health period. And all this guy was there for, was to show the whole class on the projector around a slaughter house in work. That includes close up shots of animals being sIaughtered. He kept saying (to the whole class), ""If you're looking away, or hiding your face, try and ask yourself why you're doing that"". His whole purpose for being there was to guilt everyone out of eating meat. That entire class revolved around it that day. It was miserable.
  
  People like him sicken me. I don't at all like or ""support"" what goes on before I buy the animal products I consume. But I'm not about being guilt tripped, and especially not guilt tripped into changing my whole entire lifestyle. It's not right to try and do that to people. It's not educational and helpful, it's manipulative and forceful. Using guilt as a tool in order to instill a need for change into people is wrong.
  
  In short... wanting to educate others and bring awareness to others, because you care? Good. The quote you gave me is simple, but to the point. Guilt tripping others and using how awful they feel against them to coerce them into changing their lifestyle? Bad.

  I'm not religious, so my wishes and wants aren't something I'd consider to be influenced by a God. But I do most often wish that people would show their true colors up front.

   How do you build up your self-esteem? When you have been called ugly half of your life
  ","
  The most important (and possibly even the hardest) step to take is to not compare yourself to others. Comparing yourself and how you look to everyone can be one of the most damaging things you can do to yourself. Everyone is born different, and everyone looks different. So you can't hold yourself to the expectation that you will be anything other than yourself! And just because you look different from people you idolize does not mean that you are ugIy. You are uniquely You, and you deserve to embrace that.

  This isn't a ""girls' question"", it's not only a heteronormative (assuming everyone is straight) question but a racıst question too. Keep this kind of shıt far away from me.
  
  Think before you carelessly align thoughts and share them with others. Do you hear yourself? Here's what you sound like: ""I'm not racıst, I just navigate who I love based on no other factors but the color of their skin"". Newsflash: it is racıst to base your attraction (and / or lack of) around race. If I asked you, ""would you date this black guy"" and you said, ""no because he's black"" guess what.. sorry to be the bearer of bad news but you are racıst. It's not that hard to grasp.

  Lately I've been feeling more mellow, chilled out music. Some lo-fi, shoegaze, bedroom pop.. vibes like that have been the go-to lately.

  If it was possible, I would go back and change the lack of attention / time I made for making art. I've not done much artistically since (if I remember correctly) 2018. And even then, I wasn't exactly doing it much.
  
  I would take those less productive years and turn them around, of only I could.

   Am I a narcissist if I heart my own questions? or answers?
  ","
  No, narcissism (and by association narcissistic personality disorder) is much more deep and complex than just pressing a button on your own profile. It's honestly a word that we should avoid throwing around as much as we do.
  
  If you ""like"" or ""heart"" or ""favorite"" your own posts, you're not a narcissist. If you do it, you're possibly someone who's keen on wasting free time. Or someone who is struggling with insecurities about the amount of interactions you get on social media. It depends on the person and the feelings they have!

   If you were on the airplane ...which seat would you take and why?
  ","
  So long as the flight has open seats, I would choose the window seat. Regardless of my fear of heights, I found myself wanting to look out of the window a lot when I traveled to and from Maine. I wanted to see the view from so high up above! And that's what I want to be able to see on every flight in the future, if I can help it.
  
  The airline I flew then allowed me to pick and change seats, so I made sure to set myself away from people. That way I could have the window seat, and have open space next to me (which I'm just more comfortable with).

   Does jealousy harm relationships?
  ","
  Yes. Jealousy is an emotion that is spawned from negativity. The nąsty thing about negative emotions is that they can tend to make you spiral deeper. When you spiral, despairing over worries we've picked up on can make you act toxic. Solely because the negativity got full grip of you and is telling you you're justified.
  
  There's times where we will be jealous and it's actually justified. But it's important to sit with oneself and analyze everything rationally *ourselves*. And do it before jealousy does all the talking. If you're jealous and it's really justified, make the non-toxic decision and just end the relationship.

   Do you wear your pink jeans
  ","
  No, because nothing ever seems to match with them right 🥺 they're hot pink — practically neon. And they stand out SO FAR from my very pale skin. Plus I haven't seen them in a while!
  "

   Do you play any instruments
  ","
  I don't, nope! I'd love to learn how to play some form of string instrument, though. Harp, violin, guitar.. things like that!

   Yu like black dudes ?
  ","
  I do not raciaIIy fetıshize, nor do  I raciaIIy discrimınate. In simpler terms: I don't chase people for the color of their skin, but I also don't turn people away because of the color of their skin. It's messed up to base attraction around skincolor —  actually it's dehumanızing. In doing so, you're making it out to be the only characteristic of a wholeąss human being to be worth considering.

  I'm always half-and-half about this. This is something I ask myself a whole lot, but can never find a conclusion on! I feel like I might want to be, but at the same time that comes with a lot of issues. Being internet famous is just one of those things that sounds good but has so many drawbacks.

  (First, I wanted to say that I am sorry my knee-jerk response to this ask was, ""into a glass.."")
  
  — × Every day, I pour my energy into enlightening myself, and discovering! Specifically, discovering who I am, where I should be, what my goals are, and what makes me happy. Much of my energy is going towards this journey because I feel like it's time to move into the new phases of my life. Right now, I'm welcoming all this change — warmly.

How animals are able to stick together and continue persevering through the cold. Things like that bring on positive revelations. It inspires me to see the way the world keeps on going, despite all things bad.

  Nope! I think I only ever watched tbe New Years ball drop once. And that was just in passing with my family when I was a kid, since it was what was on TV.
  
  There's just much more interesting things to do with the end and start of a year than watch other people celebrate.

   how long have you used askfm and what are your thoughts and experiences overall?
  ","
  I've used Ask on and off for a couple years. I used to have a couple really old accounts, but I can't even remember the usernames so I never got into them.
  
  As for this account, I've had it siiince.. maybe last year? And then I had a period of inactivity that lasted for a few months til August. But since then, I've been active.
  
  My experiences overall with Ask.. are not good. I'm not a fan of the way the people in charge here run their app. They don't handle the majority of features they add properly, so everything winds up sIoppy and broken! The vast majority of the userbase is toxıc ąnons with Gōd complexes. And let's not bite into the mass of problems there is with the overall security, and the moderation team..
  
  Genuinely, this app bIows. I've thought about leaving several times. But in truth, the intriguing questions that sometimes come my way help me to open up and talk about a topic. It's kind of like getting random writing prompts, but to talk about yourself and your ideas. I value that. But there's so much on this platform to hąte that makes me question if this one value is even worth it.

   my male friend told me that he weighs 104 pounds. he is 5' 10"" should i be concerned?
  ","
  It's okay to be concerned, but to a certain extent. At the end of the day it's up to the individual what they eat and how they manage themselves. But if this is a close friend, and you know he trusts you, sit him down and ask about it. Don't be insensitive and direct by saying something like, ""why are you so underweight"". Try to open the conversation a little more sensitively to form a space of trust — maybe ask, ""Are you okay"". If he asks why you're asking, say something like, ""I have been concerned about your wellbeing since you talked about your weight"".
  
  It's important to keep in mind that people can be underweight for a plethora of reasons — from eating disorders to conditions that cause weight loss. Since you don't seem to know the cause, it's important to approach this conversation by being sensitive and open ended. Don't throw around things like, ""you need to eat more"" or ""you're too skinny"" because frankly things like that are ıgnorant and not needed — they don't help. And don't pry if it seems like he's uncomfortable to talk about it. Leave the conversation open on your end, but let his responses / reactions be signs of when it's time to back off. Just let him know he has  a place to talk about it without judgement.

   Weird food combo you like
  ","
  I do have a couple of things that others find weird!
  
  First, how I like my favorite Subway sandwich made. It's their chicken, bacon and ranch sandwich with a ""twist"" introduced by myself and
  
   @chicken_teriyaki
  
  — mustard and pickles. A few Subway workers actually reacted with their faces when taking our order. 😂 I just like the added tangy flavor that the mustard and pickles bring to the table. Only if it's lightly put on!!
  
  Second, I really like dipping french fries in ketchup and mustard. But (again) only a light amount of mustard. Fries are just really good dipped in ketchup and then slightly dipped in mustard. (It's probably not as weird of a food combo as the first one, when I think about it. But it's worth mentioning I guess¿?)

  ... Well not to be a Debbie-Downer, buuut. You did say they just took it today. Symptoms aren't going to be immediate, so they're still likely to happen. Here's what I found on the web:

   Ever wonder how the world would end?
  ","
  The end of the world is something that I've always wondered about. And I pondered upon it a whole lot more during 2020.
  
  I don't even necessarily mean in a negative, doomy gloomy way. Sure there were a lot of bad days that caused those thoughts to be incredibly negative. But most of the time, I actually wonder about it because of curiosity about our own mortalıty. I'm talking about how we start a story on this planet that we will never truly Finish.
  
  Sure, our own individual stories will end. But the vastness of the universe — and heII even just planet Earth alone — makes me feel like our individual stories are just mere chapters in the whole story of life. It makes me feel like myself and all around me, is small. A lot of those feelings all tie back to the fact that we currently living beings will likely not see the end of Everything.
  
  To be honest, I don't think I'm content with that. Even if it's grim, I am always wanting to know. It would just be a funky form of closure for me to know what's going to happen to the planet I lived on, loved, and explored.

  For a while there, I was failing to get Niella to learn to use her puppy stairs! She wanted to either be picked up, or to be lifted up and set on the furniture by her bed. Or those few weird times that she used all her might to jump up by herself 😭
  
  But eventually, she got the hint! She eventually learned what the puppy stairs were there for, and started utilizing them. Both

  and I worked on teaching her how with praise and a treat as a reward for every time she uses the stairs. It was worth all of the time and patience it took! Seeing the animals happy makes me happy.

861220,"
   If you dislike someone, how can they tell?
  ","
  In person, I think a lot of the signs come from body language and facial expressions. Maybe even the person's tone when they speak to you. If these kind of negative signs keep showing up specifically when you interact with a person, it could be an indication that they dislike you.
  
  But then again, it's hard to settle on that answer because a lot of problems are started by getting the wrong idea. Making the wrong assumptions on accident, due to being anxious. I remember learning from this educational video that anxiety can actually mess with that part of the brain that reads and processes body signals. Your anxiety can make you see things much worse than they actually are, like facial expressions and body language.
  
  All of the fretting can do much more harm than good. So in conclusion, the best way to tell if someone dislikes you is to just ask outright. It's not a fun thing to do, and it's pretty embarrassing because it puts you on the spot. But hey, you'll finally get an answer straight from the source of your worry. And that's worth the trouble I think, because prolonging worry is just too draining.

   is it easier to fall in love or fall out of love?

  For me, it's much easier to fall in love. Falling out of love has never been an issue to me, as much as it seems to be for other people. I know in my head and in my heart when it's time to end things. And I've never had any difficulty with leaving past feelings of love behind.
  
  I'm someone who is very much guided by their emotions and heart. And if my emotions and heart say ""it's time to go"", then I keep on moving! My perspective is that absence and loss leaves room for newfound possibilities. That perspective makes moving on so much easier for me.

  I don't think there's any fruit I particularly hate! Dislike, maybe; I am not the biggest fan of strawberries. But that's only because of its seedy texture. The taste is usually pretty good!
  
  There's also so many fruits I've yet to try, so I'm not even sure what I'd love or hate. I know at least by appearance, I hate jackfruit. I've never had it, but it just does NOT look right. The outside makes it look like humans aren't even supposed to eat it, and the insides just look like a yellow brain.

861304,"
   Do you run from neighborhood animals like skunks, opossums, raccoons & deer?
  ","
  No, no! Never. I'll keep a distance from skunks, but the rest? I like to stick around, admire, and if I'm lucky enough to I'll feed them! Actually, since we're talking about wild animals..
  
  There's a raccoon that has taken to coming by sometimes, since a few months ago, because of the food we leave in Salem's dish. Salem is the stray cat that we've been taking care of since last year.
  
  Anyways, sometimes he leaves food behind in his bowl. And not a lot of people know this, but domesticated raccoons can actually get a balanced diet from cat food. They quite like it! So when Salem wasn't there, guess who was? A raccoon! We actually caught the raccoon sleeping in Salem's bed once. And more than a couple times did we find him snooping on the porch to see if Salem had leftovers.
  
  The last time we found him on the porch, he was ""hissing"" at us to leave him alone. Then I extended my hand down with some cat food and dropped it. And the raccoon looked at me with this weird newfound understanding, before bowing his head and patting the floor of the porch to find pieces of cat food to eat.
  
  Anyways, I would seldom ever run from animals. They are all trying to get by, just as much as we are. This is a really dangerous neighborhood, so I can only imagine how hard it is for them to survive when they're living outside in all of it. If I can extend a hand and a little bit of food here and there to help them, I will. I mean, I've been shamelessly late for work before, just because I was feeding squirrels. It's just the kind of person I am.

  I'm sorry that you've been hit with this weird wave of deleted answers too. I've seen plenty of your posts and I never see any issue! I know for a fact you don't deserve that.

  ","
  I've had so many anons try to do this with me. I don't let that kind of stuff happen, because my profile doesn't need to be full of their nastiness.
  
  They can be hateful, and all they want in return is hateful and negative energy. They don't deserve the ""satisfaction"" (I suppose that's what they get out of it?¿?) of that. If I don't just straight up report and block, I usually just post a meme and move on.

  I love thrift shopping for clothes, tbh. My favorite fashion thrift store is Platos Closet! They always have good deals. I find a lot of discounted clothes from Forever 21 there. Most of the stuff I've bought actually still has tags and everything, so it's usually brand new clothes at a cheaper markdown!

  OHHH the fire coins! I gotcha now. Yeah, they really do have no value. I mean when they were first introduced, it was incredibly easy to get coins. Then they made them more difficult to earn, trying to make them seem ""special"" and ""exclusive"". When really they aren't anything of significance. The feature is a real letdown tbh..

   Is it best to defend people, or should they do it, themselves? Is self-defense always a learned behavior?
  ","
  Self-defense is, in most people, a learned behavior. Not everyone is able to utilize their feelings (be it fear, anxiety, stress, etc) to channel their defenses. For those, it can take a lot of guidance and practice to be able to hone their ability to defend themselves.
  
  So that being said, it's important that those of us who *do* know how to defend ourselves lend a hand to those who do not. All it can take is one helpful hand to guide someone. And that helpful hand might just save a life, for one reason or the other. No one should try and ""be a hero"" — but serving acts of kindness to those in need shouldn't be looked down upon.

   Who is your favorite villain from a movie, show etc.? What makes you love to hate them? 😈
  ","
  I took a lot of interest in Oswald  Cobblepot (The Penguin) — specifically from Gotham. I never really had much knowledge of the Batman universe outside of a couple of things I'd seen, so Gotham was my biggest dive into it. A lot of the villains from the Batman universe were present, so needless to say it was my first introduction to a lot of these characters. But I really do think watching the parts with The Penguin were my favorite.
  
  For some reason, the build of his character throughout the seasons was really fascinating to see unfold. He starts off as a nobody who would eventually start conniving and manipulating his way to the top, being kicked down and climbing on back over and over.  He's a sneaky bąstard, and the sneaky bąstard characters are so interesting because they're psychologically complex. The whole journey that was showed with this character made me keep wondering ""what's next"". Genuinely, I felt that he was written out and acted out excellently.

   Do you like your local police force or not? Why?
  ","
  NOPE not at all. The local police force is absolutely useless for many reasons. They seldom ever arrive on house calls. And on the rare occasions when they do, they aren't of any help. Usually what they'll do instead is drive down the street of the house called on ONCE, and if they don't immediately see or hear anything they leave. No investigation, no matter how serious the call was for.
  
  The fastest action I've seen a cop here take is turning on their lights just to blow through traffic around reds and yellows. So yeah I mean, nothing useful.
  "
861413,"
   Do you believe in the phrase “Fake it until you make it”?

  I don't at all believe in that. If ones life and life story are faked through, then what kind of life is really even ""made""? It doesn't seem like any type of way to live. Life is hard, but living a lie can only further deteriorate mental health.

   How do you eliminate stressful situations?
  ","
  It's hard to determine how to eliminate a stressful situation. Most of the time, the best one can do is try to eliminate the stress that's being felt.
  
  In order to begin solving things, it's important to start by determining precisely what about the situation is  stressful. After that is figuring out if the cause of stress can be eliminated or avoided. Coming up with a game plan is the next step from there, but of course I know it can't always be easy.
  
  If all else fails, the only other option is to find ways to cope.

  ","
  People fear losing things they don't have, because the time and effort put into obtaining those things is also put into the equation. Surrounding oneself with high expectations on what can be achieved can be good, of course. But it can also add too much pressure. And so, combing intense desire and pressure can lead to that fear.

  When a blackout hits, I quickly shut down everything attached to my backup battery first. Second, I go around the house to see if the power is off in every other room. And then third, I rush to light a node 3-wick candle and listen to some music. Maybe I'll read a Webtoon, or mess with social media. Blackouts aren't usually the worst thing to happen for me, unless it affects my tech.

  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! Wanted to stop real quick to say, thanks for all of the interesting questions that you've sent out this year. You have some of the best ones! Also, I hope that your new year has started off proper.
  
  — – - To answer your question; there's a lot that I'm hoping and aspiring on right now. I have goals that are aimed relatively high. This year, my biggest goal of them all is to M O V E. This neighborhood has been taking a toll on my mental health for years because it just isn't safe. Last year was meant to be The Year. But COVID ruined a lot, and some interpersonal tragedies happened that took that goal further and further away from me. Myself and my partner are building back up our financial health so that we can finally find a better place to call home.
  
  Besides that, I have a lot of personal goals I want to work on. Reaching internal peace, training my anxiety, gaining weight, etc etc etc. Plenty of things I want to achieve within myself in order to reach a state of being wholly content.

  I've personally felt that for a long time, they've been getting worse. Anymore it seems like TV has two primary facets: nostalgia bait and cheaply produced garbage.
  
  I haven't had cable for years, and I have absolutely zero regrets. Television just doesn't provide the most quality forms of entertainment anymore.

   There's been a lot of debate recently where I live about whether you should set off fireworks or not around New Year's Eve. How they affect the health of animals and the environment in general has been the biggest point of contention. Where do you stand on this? 🤔✨
  ","
  Tbh I agree, fireworks do much more harm than good. Sure, they look pretty, but I don't think the tradeoff is really even worth setting them off.
  
  My dogs get terrified on holidays where fireworks are common. They often get so scared that they don't want to eat, so I can't feed them their calming gummy treats to even help level their anxiety...
  
  I'm just not a fan of all of the noise, chaos, and stress of residents popping this and that off. I don't think everyone should just be able to set off fireworks in the city. Maybe in an open field, but that still poses its own risks..

   How would you summarize your 2020? Anything good that happened in your life despite the pandemic and such? 😄🗓
  ","
  My summarization of My 2020 in one word: WEIRD.
  
  It was just a very haphazard, awkward, weird year. While there was plenty of good moments, I sure did have to go through a lot of awkward ones, and I suffered a lot.
  
  But out of my suffering, I was able to discover more about myself and what I want to do with my life. Overcoming the hardships toxic people put me through has made me aware of how much better I deserve, and what good can come from focusing on oneself.
  
  From this year, I will take the strength I've grown within myself, my courage, and my will to strive for better. And I will make 2021 a much more progressive year for myself and my life. I'm determined to!

   What would be good advice for a guy on getting to know a girl without coming off weird? We work together, but I don’t know how to approach her :/
  ","
  I wouldn't rush into confessing / asking her out or anything. Spend some time striking up casual conversations! It's a good idea to start talking about common things, like work and such. If the opportunity is present over time, talk about stuff outside of work.
  
  To ease into that, start sprinkling in some stuff about yourself during conversation. Sometimes people feel more comfortable opening up about their personal lives if the other person in the conversation does it first. Some people prefer to keep their personal lives outside of work, however. So if you get signs that she's uncomfortable breaking past that coworker commonplace talk, it's best to pull back and assess the situation. Chances are if she's not interested in talking about aspects of her life outside of work to a coworker, she wouldn't be interested in dating a coworker.
  
  Take your time, be patient, allow room for casual conversations first! And good luck.

   What do you usually do with bugs in your home? Does it depend on the kind of bug? How? 🐜🕷🦟

  What I do with bugs in my home ALWAYS depends on what kind. And I know there's a lot of people who find that shıtty but LOOK. Look. I can't deal with spiders. It's kiII or be kiIIed with them, as far as my anxiety understands. 😔
  
  I'm much more prone to being gentle with ladybugs, flies (if I can help it), and otherwise more harmless and less intimidating insects. I like to try and help them out of the house.
  
  Speaking of ladybugs though, I have a small habitat set up to house them in for the winter! Here's a gif of one I rescued from work last night. It was on the brink of dęath when I found it, and so was the other one (not shown, he was out of shot).

   If girls think that s ex is gross and disgusting (to the point they don't even wanna talk about it) why most if not all end up having boyfriends, husbands, fiancées, which means sooner or later they will have s ex everyday and getting pregnant and having babies? 🤔
  ","
  You're really that dense huh. What's your secret? Are you this stupıd naturally, or did you train yourself to act out in this level of idıocy?
  
  — Instead of blatantly assuming that people think sęx is gross because they don't wanna talk about it, why don't you try to rub your feeble little braincells together and think critically? Think in consideration of anyone that isn't yourself. Jfc it's not that hard.
  
  — Different people have different boundaries. People aren't ""grossed out"" by sęx, they're grossed out that strangers (more often than not hiding on anon) are trying to pry about their sęxual prowess and sęx lives. When nobody has a right to be that fűcking invasive!
  
  — OH also, women aren't here to ""have sęx everyday and get pregnant"". Women aren't here to please ANYONE, that includes men and yes that includes their potential ""boyfriends"". Women aren't sęx and baby machines, they are human beings.
  
  Your twisted way of thinking and your twisted ideology for relationships isn't ""the way"". Everyone Is Different. Every Relationship Is Different. But apparently, schmucks like you can't mind their own business — even when it's the easiest and most energy efficient thing to do. No, you'd rather have strangers justify not wanting to talk to other strangers about their personal shıt. And you're using your messed up ideology of what Y O U think a proper relationship is to shame people for having personal boundaries. You're disgusting.

  I don't really care for ""thought pieces"" (or ""opinion pieces"") in journalism; factual writing is the best source of information one can hope to find.

  Then there's you, sending out the same copy-paste message to numerous users for ""entertainment"". What a waste of time and ever-shortening life.

  My favorite family tradition is actually one that died a long time ago.

  Nope, not as far as I know. I don't think I've ever seen anyone be nasty to anyone about rankings. But if there is lmk, because I don't need that kinda energy around me. I'd just block people that wanna act like that.

   Could you invent a new ice cream flavor?
  ","
  Maybe! It'd have to be something really bizarre and undesirable though, because most common desserts have an ice cream flavor.
  
  I thought ""maybe macaroni and cheese ice cream doesn't exist"" but unfortunately.. it does. Okay let's see, maybe lasagna..? Yeah it doesn't look like there's ice cream flavored like lasagna yet. It's possible to come up with some ideas for new flavors, but nothing that sounds good. So maybe it wouldn't be worth trying to invent a new flavor 😂

   Would you want to own an aquarium? If you had an unlimited budget, what kind of animals would you want to have in it? 🐚🐠🐡Would said aquarium be based on a certain biome or have any themed decorations inside of it? 🏝🗽🗼
  ","
  I think having an aquarium would be neat, but it's really expensive to get an aquarium appropriate for the habitants inside. And the upkeep is a little bit too much for me to commit to.
  
  I think I'd rather have a terrarium! I'd like to have one for insects, most specifically ladybugs. If I had the opportunity to build my own, I'd like to model the pieces to be fairytale themed. I'd make colorful oversized mushrooms, maybe a couple with doors that can be opened.. It would be neat!
  
  I already take care of ladybugs, and I have a small setup for them. But nothing special just yet! When I have the room and the budget though, I'd love to craft something special.

  Also I just looked up where to watch it! It appears as though it used to be on Netflix, since there's a title webpage for it. But it leads to an error. I might be able to watch it on prime video, since I have a free prime membership. But I'm not sure since I don't really use Amazon typically to begin with. I'll find it somehow either way.

   what are your thoughts on both PS5 and Xbox Series X being $500? Too expensive? Just right?
  ","
  Much, MUCH too expensive. New consoles have been ""too expensive"" for generations now, in my eyes. And all of that cost for significantly weaker hardware and software. And neither of those are exactly modifiable.
  
  A good gaming PC has quite the expense to swallow, sure. But I'd much rather set myself up on a payment plan for a beefy upgradable pre-build (or heII just the parts for building my own). It's better than tossing $500 out the window on something that will continually lose usability once the next one comes out.
  
  A good gaming PC (and one with upgradable parts) promises support for games of the past, present, and future. I'll take that over a console any day. It's just so much more worth it!

  I'd vote rose gold. Decorating your room around a special interest is pretty cool, but interests can change! It'd suck to put so much work into redecorating and then eventually not be into the other two anymore. But that's just my two cents!

  I tend to prefer figuring out things for myself on most things. Because who's best to find a solution to a problem than someone who's standing right in the middle of it, right? But there is times where I have asked for advice and taken it. It really depends on the personal sensitivity of the situation.

  Ice cream cone!! Snow cones are pretty good, but the flavor can tend to run out of it. That can make it hard to finish eating! Also snow cones are the best if eaten before melting. That's awful to a slow eater like me. ( ੭⌯᷄ω⌯᷅ ).｡

  If it's just something I happened upon, however.. it's not up to me to call it out. Secrets are made to be secrets for a reason. If I accidentally found out something personal that I should have, I'd rather keep hush. It feels like the most respectful thing to do, if I found something out on accident. Unless that secret puts that friend in danger, anyways.

  I think the last time I got sick was when I got the flu. I believe that was some time last year! In my adult life, I find myself rarely ever getting sick. I'm really conscious of germs, and I keep myself and my more ""germy"" environments very clean.
  
  Also, I have been this big of a germophobe since long before the pandemic, so it's not like I feel much different. The only new thing I'm doing that I wasn't already is wearing a mask!

   Do you support ""free relationship""? Meaning dating multiple people at once and not being limited to one person?
  ","
  That's actually called ""poIyamory"" — and yes, I support it! There's absolutely nothing wrong with healthy poIyamorous relationships. And when I say healthy, I mean two key important things:
  
  * {Everyone is in the know} — Complete transparency. Being involved with people behind the backs of everyone you're seeing is NOT poIyamory; it is cheating. It's important that everyone you're seeing knows up-front what your intentions are.
  
  * {Everyone agrees and consents} — Everyone involved knows that you are poIyamorous, and that you are seeing other people, AND everyone is fully okay with that.  Be communicative and honest.
  
  As an example, I am poIyamorous actually. And my partner is monogamous. We have talked about my want to explore other relationships, and together we have agreed on it! We have our own specific terms of Do's and Don'ts that work best for the well-being of our relationship. And it's about as easy-peasy as that!
  
  Everyone is different though. If you yourself are in a relationship with someone who is monogamous and doesn't want a poIyamorous partner.. it's for the better to end that relationship. Limiting yourself will only make you unhappy, which makes your partner unhappy. And going behind your partner's back despite them not wanting the relationship to be that way is just as bad, if not worse.
  
  Anyways. Yes, I support poIyamory. Because just like with monogamous relationships, they can be healthy OR unhealthy. It all depends on compatability and communication!

It pays bills. And these people out here doing that work are risking their personal safety day in and day out for a living. That deserves respect.

   What is your favorite drink on cold evenings?
  ","
  A hot mug of tea, with 2 or 3 packets of sweet n low! It can really be just about every flavor (I'm a collector of teas, so I have plenty of favorites), but mint magic and caramel apple dream are cold day favorites.
  
  I also really love a hot matcha latte on cold days too; I pick one up from Dunkin' Donuts every so often before work.
  "

   Xbox or playstation?
  ","
  I've never owned an Xbox — so Playstation it is! I grew up in a Sony household I suppose you could say. We had both the PS1 and PS2, then the PS3 was given to me as a gift one Christmas. And I myself got the PS4.
  
  BUT I will say this here and now: I have no intentions of buying the PS5. I personally felt that the PS4 was a bad investment, and I do not want to continue buying consoles. I play on PC now, and on PC I plan to stay. At least with an upgradeable PC, I feel like I'm getting my money's worth for generations of video games. Both to come, and of the past.

  Tbh? Sometimes it feels like it's not my choice! But I think it might be due to my eating habits and the amount I move around during the day. I'm a very busy bodied person, most especially at work. The combination of my daily habits just kinda does that for me I suppose!

  Yeah, you'll notice that when you have anon turned on, that's seemingly all you'll get. It's why I have it off most of the time!!
  
  It makes ask a whole lot more boring, because it limits the amount of interaction. You can see who sends stuff, so you can't follow them or ask them more stuff. Interaction stops as soon as the anon stops. Then it's like... who knows if you'll ever speak with them again.

   Is eBay trustworthy for buying Computers, Gaming consoles, or phone from a 100% reliable vendor?
  ","
  No, no, no and a thousand times NO!!! Even if there's pics and vids with it powered on, there could be a plethora of problems you (as the buyer) cannot see.
  
  If you're looking to buy a computer, it could have a virus. If you're looking to buy a console, it could be quick to overheating or it won't read disks properly. Oh and don't get me started on all of the issues a phone could potentially have, besides it being someone's phone that the seller stole and factory reset.
  
  I'm really just putting out some issues that tech stuff could have when resold online. Remember: if something looks too good to be true, it probably is. Ebay is strictly person to person, and the person selling stuff to you might not be 100% reliable and honest. It's important to keep your guard up on sites like  eBay. ESPECIALLY since support rarely intervenes on purchases once said and done.
  
  Trust your gut. Be critical. Be careful.

  I don't think it's a dumb question at all!! I was recently thinking the same thing myself, tbh. If I recall, that was just the other night (I believe Friday)!
  
  Tbh I think that warm milk is rumored to help people sleep because the warmth is comforting. And the richness of the milk combined with the warmth is soothing all around. Basically I thought it was generally rumored to be that way because warm drinks are associated with comfort. And comfort is associated with sleepiness!

  There's just something so tasty about mini finger snack versions of bigger foods. And I know what it is:  They're jam packed on the flavor of each ingredient, because they're meant to be one bite ""poppers"". You taste everything at once! That's just what makes them so good.

   we made it through the first week of december !! 💖 what were some highlights of this week?
  ","
  This week's hilights:
  
  * I managed my time a whole lot better at work, even on busy days.
  
  * Tuesday we had a massive snowstorm from the previous night going into all day. And though we got stuck in the road and I had to call off of work, some kind strangers came by and helped us out. It was a nice surprise to see some good still present in this awful neighborhood.
  
  * Me and
  
   @chicken_teriyaki
  
  trimmed and bathed all of the doggos, and gave them new beds.
  
  * I got to closely observe squirrel behavior during winter and snow up close. And speaking of squirrels...
  
  * I got to feed a few of my local neighborhood squirrels.
  
  * Salem (the stray cat we take care of) has been showing a lot of affection!! On Wednesday, I spent a lot of time outside with him. He would jump up and stand on his hinds to bump his head on my hand every time I held it out. He's such a cutie!!
  
  There's a lot of other things, but these are already all over the place as it is. Not at all in order throughout the week so.. this post is a MESS.. but these were some of my favorite moments from the first week of December.

  It has been a VERY busy day. I mean wow, I really didn't expect it all to take so long!

It was really cute to see them all trot around so energized and refreshed after their haircuts. But WOW do they fight hard against getting groomed. The scissors are a fearful enemy, and the trimmer is the devil to them. (´‐ω‐)
  
  I'm exhausted after all of that!! I showered, finally got some food in my system, and have been relaxing since. Aside from how sleepy I am though, I feel like it was a fulfilling day. They're starting to slowly get into the idea of having a new grooming routine. Seeing that development in them while we work together is so wholesome!!

   Are you someone who replies to messages (such as texts) immediately, or do you wait? Do you get impatient if others reply to you late?
  ","
  For your first question, it depends on a few factors. Like if a person JUST sent the message. If that's the case, I'll wait a couple of minutes to try and leave ""breathing room"" between messages. Some other factors are where I am, what I'm doing, and how busy I am. But generally, if I see a message notification I try to be on it within ten minutes!
  
  As for your second question, I don't feel like it's fair to be impatient with people who aren't replying ""fast enough"" to your liking. It's selfish, and shows a lack of care (and general understanding) for the other person's situation. It's unrealistic to expect someone's continuous availability. And besides, we aren't meant to be clinging to our phones waiting for the next reply! Text is for the convenience of speaking to a person as soon as possible while you're doing things in your own world. It shouldn't be held to the same expectations that face to face conversation and phone calls have.

   Today is international day of persons with disabilities. What's something you feel people should know about either disabilities in general, people with disabilities or a specific disability?
  ","
  There's so many things that able bodied people need to learn about physical disabilities, and so many things that neurotypical people need to learn about mental disabilities. Ableism for both physical and mental disabilities is alive and rampant, and the lack of proper education and attention on the topic doesn't help. But here's some helpful things I think everyone should keep in mind / think about / exercise:
  
  .‎˖٭ ✩ Disabled persons do not want you to treat them differently for their disability. They want to be treated like everyone else: with human decency and respect. (Some of my points ahead will show what I mean)
  

  .‎˖٭ ✩ Maintain eye contact when you talk. People with physical disabilities will feel uncomfortable and self conscious if you gawk at the equipment that assists them. Avoid putting visual attention on their equipment unless they ask.
  
  .‎˖٭ ✩ Do not be patronizing with your interactions. Do not do ""baby talk"" or use pet names. This kind of treatment is humiliating, even if you mean well.
  
  .‎˖٭ ✩ Avoid showing pity / treating disabled people as if they are victims. Again even if you mean well, it is degrading.
  
  .‎˖٭ ✩ Always be mindful of your language when you speak about disabilities, and persons with a lack thereof. Examples: Do not call a person a ""cripple"" or call them ""deformed"" — terms like this are offensive and make disabled people feel abnormal. Do not refer to non disabled people as ""normal"" or ""healthy"" — it implies something is ""wrong"" with disabled persons. Using ""non disabled"" or ""able-bodied"" is fine.
  
  .‎˖٭ ✩ NEVER physically assist unless you are asked to, most especially with their assisting equipment and their bodies. Do not (without permission): push a person's wheelchair, physically lift them, or touch their equipment.
  
  .‎˖٭ ✩ Do NOT mess with service dogs. They are on duty, meaning that distractions away from their duties assisting a person around is dangerous to their handler.

  (Thanks for sticking through my tangent!) Now to answer your question.. I can do both!! But I tend to prefer iced. I think the cold of it and the bitterness go pretty well together.

  Also I'm an essential worker, and even if my workplace didn't require masks I'd still be wearing one. I'm not going to allow myself to potentially die just because ""UUUuu boo hoo masks aren't comfortable"". You know what's really uncomfortable? The concept of getting sick with the illness that everyone is now afraid of, being quarantined from loved ones while your body fights like heII for your survival, and waiting through tremendously awful sickness to see if you'll even survive. THAT'S really uncomfortable. I wear my mask on a daily basis with no complaints because it's so much better than the alternative.

   what do you like to do for fun
  ","
  Tons of things! I'll list off some of my all time favorite things to do. These are some of my favorite activities:
  
  * playing games - I primarily play on my PC, but I also have my 3DS. Also, I use my phone and computer as emulators for a great number of systems!
  
  * reading - I mostly read Webtoon comics and manga. But I would love recommendations for full books, as I want to do much more reading in the near future.
  
  * drawing - It's not something I do often anymore because of a lack of inspiration. But I used to draw all of the time, and still quite enjoy it! My primary method for creating art was pixel art, because I find it to be really charming.
  
  * cooking - Mostly experimentally!! I have only a few recipes down pat that I know how to make well. Like tacos, for instance.
  
  * creating small ascii - I like to make kaomoji (like unicode faces, such as ( ٥˶⩌ ⩊⩌)୨՞՞ which I made recently), animals, and sometimes small bio / drop down layouts for Vent.
  
  * biking - This is one I haven't done in a while, because the last time I did someone came into the yard and stole it. I've been hesitant to take it back out since we took it back!! Plus crime rates are really high here this year, But I really have been itching to go on a bike ride.
  
  * nature walking - Almost nothing brings on more peace and calm than a good walk through a thicket of woods! But it's also fun to me, because I get to see new plants to take pictures of. And if I'm lucky, maybe even some wildlife.
  
  * taking pictures - I like to take pictures of plants and animals! Like if I'm taking a hike and I see a neat looking flower, I'll usually take the time to snap a good shot of it.
  
  * feeding local wildlife - Strays, raccoons, squirrels.. I love taking care of them!
  
  * singing - MOSTLY by myself. I've only sung to and around a couple of people. But I do think it's fun!
  
  * discovering new music - Sometimes I'll do a deep dive through Spotify and Bandcamp to discover new music that might suit my tastes.

  Even as real as fear is, it's the mind that conjures it. And it often plagues us when there really is no fearful thing or occurrence happening.

   how true are you with all your promises?
  ","
  I'm as honest as can possibly be, and I only ever make promises that I'm sure I can keep. The only promises that are broken, are ones that have exceptions based on unforeseeable (and most often unfortunate) occurrences.
  
  An example of this is, ""I promise I'll always be here for you"". This is a promise that I make to people I love and care about, with the best intentions. An unforeseeable occurrence that would waive this promise, is if that person were being crappy and I had to cut them off.
  
  Barring anything bad happening that would stop me from keeping a promise.. I am a person of my word.

   what music u like!?
  ","
  I like all different kinds of music!! Like if I wrote down every song I have in my playlist to put in a hat and pull twice from, the two pulled have a 99.9% chance of being EXTREMELY different from each other.
  
  I just watched my Spotify wrapped for the year!! The top genres that it listed for me are:
  
  #1) Indie Pop
  
  #2) J-Pop
  
  #3) Modern Rock
  
  #4) Otacore
  
  #5) Pop
  
  And that seems like a relatively fair assessment of my most frequent listening history. But I also like many other genres such as: shoegaze, bedroom pop, classic rock, rap, metal, alternative rock, garage rock, classic rock, city pop, dream pop, alternative R&B, hip hop, emo, electropop, lo-fi.. you name it. I like a lot of stuff.

   Opinion on indigenous people hunting/killing animals
  ","
  Indigenous peoples depend on the environment / land in which they live for resources. They build their communities within that land, grow their roots there, and they have been doing that for thousands of years before we even came close to it. So with that being said, it's important that (we) non indigenous individuals respect their heritage. We need to understand that those lands are theirs to have rational jurisdictions over. And them being allowed to reasonably use the resources around them to survive is absolutely rational.
  
  Also, what actually we need to worry about is commercial hunters and poachers. These are the people who use nature selfishly and wastefully, cause species extinction, and do harm to the environment. Not people who have been hunting as a means to survival naturally for thousands of years.

  I actually just recently ended a relationship that was becoming rapidly toxic. It ended with me cutting ties completely, because the way I was being treated was poor. All of it was putting my mental health through the wringer, so when it was getting to be too painful and no hope was left— *I* left. And yeah, I did put in the effort and time to try and ""fix"" it. But I want to REALLY emphasize this:
  
  You Can't Fix Everything— and that is Okay. It's not your responsibility to try and ""fix"" someone's toxic behaviors. This kind of thing goes beyond just wasting time. Doing this always ends up with you repeatedly subjecting yourself to pain. All at the sake of trying to fix someone else's emotional misgivings. The damage all of that can do to you is significant! At the end of the day, sometimes you have to evaluate what it's really worth to try. And to also genuinely evaluate how much hurt you're getting into by trying.
  
  REMEMBER: it's up to the individual to work on themselves and their growth. That's not really something you can just give to a person.

  Something that makes me feel a really weird sense of nostalgia, though, is shoegaze music. Shoegaze is this really dreamy sounding indie pop / alternative rock mix. And for some reason, the overall tone of songs under the genre makes me really nostalgic. I can't begin to explain it!

   Do you think the weather affects your mood at all? If so, how?
  ","
  IT DOES yes it absolutely does. It also affects how my hair behaves..
  
  But yes, the weather affects my mood. I think it's a pretty common phenomenon! If I had to explain it— Sunny days bring on energy because everything is bright and warm. Cloudy days sort of make me moody and drowsy because there's never much going on. Rain evokes calm in me, so I feel naturally relaxed when it rains. Though on days where I want to be out and doing stuff, rain can put me in a demotivated state.

  It used to be a little Christmas tradition amongst me and my sisters to stay up on Christmas eve, as long as we could. And we'd usually end up passing out in blankets on the floor or on the couch, watching Christmas reruns.
  
  That was sooo long ago. I remember how hurt I was the first time that tradition broke. Because I knew that it was the end of that. And from there, the sibling drift widened.
  
  Well that kinda turned sad! But anyways it was a really wholesome holiday time thing. Back then.

  I've never walked in my sleep, but I HAVE talked in my sleep a few times when I was younger. One time was when I was a kid, and I was bedridden sick in the hospital, I was giggling and talking in my sleep. I was talking about how butterflies kept landing on and tickling me. I remember nothing from back then because I was very ill and out of it, but my mom told me that. I was also told once I dreamt about Crash Bandicoot (which I played religiously on the PS1) and collecting hidden gems.

   When does loyalty become too much?
  ","
  Loyalty becomes too much when it smothers your light.
  
  Loyalty to someone / something is how we communicate interest, love, passion, and devotion. How could any of that be bad, right? Well, when that loyalty to a person / thing you like begins to consume every part of your life.. are you really living? Do you have individuality, or is your free will motivated by who / what you're loyal to?
  
  Loyalty is a good thing. But when it creeps into every unrelated turn in our life, it consumes the individual. It's important for oneself to have the time and allowance to pursue personal interests, friendships, goals, aspirations, and dreams. To pursue *INDIVIDUALITY*.
  
  You can be a loyal person and still have individuality. You can still be loyal to what you love and still pursue different branches of your life around that. But if your reason for loyalty feels threatened by your sense of individuality.. it's time to change things up. Before it consumes the rest of who you are.

  About others: I don't pay gossip about others any mind. I like to form my own opinions of people. But that's petty gossip, you know? If someone opens up about someone else being toxic with screenshots / pics of proof, I'll usually at least check to see if I can weigh the validity of the situation.
  
  About myself: I don't pay that any mind. I seriously always stick to myself and mind my own. So if someone has something to say about me, I already know they're full of it and they aren't worth my time. And anyone who believes them on their dumb drabble, then they're too ignorant to be worth the time either.

The warmth from the meat makes the vegetables less cold, and the veggies aren't the main part of the dish.

  ","
  Cyber bullying is a massive problem. Places like this practically enable it, what with there being d¡ck all for security and administrative actions. Spite for Ask's way of handling this app aside... cyber bullying is and always has been an issue. Access to the internet allows the smartest of us to expand our worlds in brilliant ways. But for the dimmer (and more bored) of us, they use it to belittle strangers. The only solution is to block people, and keep blocking people. Which is rather ineffective on sites with minimal restrictions or no banning implemented. But it's what we have, until people all over the world collectively stop raising little sh¡ts.

  I just want to suggest you be careful asking things like this. I know you're very well intentioned and it is a thought provoking question, it's just that it can be really sensitive for some people. And might trigger dissociative / unreality episodes in some people.

  Best: Flavored solidifying shell!!! Cherry, banana, butterscotch, chocolate, peanut butter.. these come in a lot of flavors, but they're my favorite ice cream topping. When you get ice cream from a place they usually dip it in the solidifying shell, but when you do it yourself there's bottles you can buy to pour it on. Either way.. SO GOOD. SO SIMPLE. SO SATISFYING.

I see the world in a much brighter life in the prospect of living forever. Living forever sounds perfect, actually. I mean imagine actually having ALL of time in the world. My life would be timeless, so I would feel less pressure to do everything I want to do. I can space things out and find more time to relax! Also in terms of time, there's the fact that I'll be able to observe generation after generation to come. See the development of society, and technology, and architecture.. just SO MANY THINGS! Also, I'll be able to witness the end of the world. Which I know is grim, but.. I started this story and I want to see how it finishes.

  Love at first sight is a myth that's believed to be true, because we are an emotionally driven species. But emotions are complicated, so something like intense Iust can be easily confused for love. And that's really all ""love at first sight"" is: Iust. You don't know the person besides their exterior, or their appearance. You don't know their story, personality, hardships, quips and quirks; n o t h i n g. You can't love someone you do not know and have only admired from the outside. That is simply Iust in disguise.

   I'm sorry I slept. I think their main goal is to make everyone stay here on their app but not necessarily safe. 🙃🙃🙃
  ","
  Hey don't be sorry! It's always good to get some rest; I hope you slept well. Also yeah tbh? It's hard to read what the staff of this app wants / envisions. There's so many major oversights (security, privacy) while focus is being more on useless features. It feels sloppy and careless.
  "
862128,"
   I agree. It is really pain in the ass these accounts are still at large, and askfm is not doing anything against them. At times, I felt unsafe using this app because of that kind of users. I feel bad for you. 🥺
  ","
  I feel the exact same. It's no wonder why a lot of cool people have came and went away from this app. It's unable to maintain a good and diverse userbase because toxicity and obsessive behaviors are so rampant. And since staff does f.a about any of it, it's basically allowed. Disturbing. I'm sorry that you've also felt a lack of personal security from this app, it's genuinely unfair that so many good people have to deal with this mess.

  ABSOLUTELY. It just enables poor behavior like what's exhibited with this weirdo. Even other crappy apps I've used have At Least IP banning as a standard form of security.

  The fact that people are allowed to make side account after side account on this app. It's really enabling to freaks like this.

  "
862131,"
   What is something that you are skeptical about?

  Ask.fm ever improving features for userbase security and comfort. The staff on this app really just does not g.a.f what their userbase does and tbh it is disgusting. Especially when they want to ask for money for these meaningless coins. I don't think any amount of money would make staff hop to fixing features that actually matter to make this app tolerable.

   what's your advice to people who likes to have/achieve a healthy long hair?
  ","
  I can offer a few really helpful tips I've learned over the years for healthy hair. I'm not sure about achieving long hair growth other than patience though!! Anyways, here's what I do know in terms of having healthy hair:
  
  * NEVER was your hair with water that's too warm. Hot water can cause damage to the fibers of our hair, and it's the most common cause of hair breakage. Try using lukewarm / cool water.
  
  * Ensure you're using shampoo and conditioner, not 2-in-1! Picking a shampoo and conditioner set that works with our hair type is essential for increasing the health of your hair. Using shortcut products like 2-in-1 doesnt nourish and protect our strands, nor does it get it properly cleaned.
  
  * Don't wash your hair nightly! Make sure to have ""skip nights"" — nights where you won't wash your hair at all. I usually wash one day, then skip the next, and wash the day after. Following that pattern doesn't stress out our strands! Excessive washing can cause breakage.
  "

  * Springtime rain is suuuper relaxing.
  
  * The temperatures are usually mild / comfortable.

  I have severe anxiety too, and I also get anxious seeing someone type for long periods of time. But as a grown up you have to take personal responsibility! If something is actively upsetting you, separate yourself from it. Close the chat window while I'm typing. No one is holding you hostage making you watch me type! Have patience with me AND yourself.

   Are you a class reductionist?
  ","
  This is actually my first time hearing the term! But upon looking into it, I don't at all resonate with it.
  
  ""The idea in some leftist circles that all oppression based on gender, sex, race, etc. is just a byproduct of class struggle, and that once class disparity is solved, all those issues will vanish""
  
  While class differences do impact all of us, there's plenty of other forms of oppression that need individually tackled. Those forms of oppression do not directly correlate with class separation; instead they have to do with personal prejudice and hate for those who are different from ourselves. It's asinine to even come close to implying that these deep rooted social issues will vanish once we resolve class differences.
  
  Anyways I'm just providing my opinion based on what I've read on the term. And based upon what I've gathered, I do not relate to it.

  Pictures of nature shows when the scene was roughly immortalized in film. You can capture the beauty of nature in all its season.
  
  Pictures of animals show a bit of  the unique personality of the animal. Also, it kind of gives us a hint of what the photographer loves and cares about.
  
  Pictures of the self can show who you are to the world with the subtleties of your personality.
  
  Photography is a beautiful thing. The technology is in our hands, and I think it's kinda beautiful that we can share little stories about our lives, one image at a time. Anyways, pictures tell a story unique to the subject and location. What that story is, depends on what's captured! But I think one thing that we can all see from photography is a little bit of personality from the photographer.

   Do you agree with the statement, ""Never meet your heroes""? Why or why not?
  ","
  OH YES, ABSOLUTELY. There's a couple of things that come to mind when I hear of that statement:
  
  1) It's important to be mindful with *who* and *how* we admire others. Looking up to someone is one thing, but it's dangerous to idolize someone. Especially a celebrity; someone who puts on a face to the world. They're someone you truly know nothing about!
  
  2) Many people idolize celebrities, and for some people that devotion ends up with them being ""lucky"" enough to finally meet their idol! A ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity.. I have heard so many stories of this going wrong and it absolutely crushing people.
  
  Usually in these stories I've heard, people eagerly go to get an autograph from their idol, only for them to be met with unexpected ""out of character"" abrasive attitude and rude behavior. And what crushes those people is forever being left with wondering: ""Why? Why did my idol act that way to me? Was it me? Were they having a bad day? Is this really who they are?"" — they're left to despair over that for the rest of their lives. Because as I said, meeting your idol is a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity. If it goes wrong, it can be hope crushing. Permanently.

   Are funny people necessarily smart?
  ","
  I think funny people *can* be smart! I don't really think the two traits correlate. A person can be stupid and funny, a person can be smart but not funny at all, and a person can be smart AND funny! It all depends on the person.
  
  Also, a person being funny doesn't necessarily make them smart automatically. It's all relative to whom it is, and subjective depending on personal opinions (on what's ""funny"" or ""smart"").
  "
862261,"
   I've had issues with this same exact person. They have repeatedly spammed me in the past and have even messaged me on my other social media after I blocked them. I'm starting to suspect that they actually get a kick out of people reacting negatively to them, it's pretty ridiculous :/

  It's hard to disagree with it, because it's a sort of positive self reinforcement! At least for some people. It can be helpful to some people because saying it allows them to easier blow off the stressing of finding out someone hates you.
  
  But in a literal sense, it's of course not true. If someone hates you, they're of course not at all admiring you. They're just shrowded in negativity and spite. The best coping mechanism for dealing with someone hating me, personally.. well. I would just ignore them.

I felt really panicked because that had me sit in a chair with a table that comes down around the waist to keep you in. Being needled, being trapped, AND having blood sucked out of me? Yeah, not a fun time.

   When you’re sad and want to cry, do you cry or do you fight it?
  ","
  My answer to this is dependant on two things:
  
  1) where I am
  
  2) if anyone is around / with me
  
  I do my best to conceal my feelings until I might find a more ""suitable"" (comfortable is another word I'd use) place to let myself cry. I don't like to be perceived at all when I'm emotionally distressed, so I'd prefer to hold it in until I can be alone. And when I'm comfortable, if I can, I'll let it out.

   What can you get from being alone?
  ","
  Mindfulness. I think that separating oneself from any situation to be alone for a little while can be healing. Even if nothing is happening to cause you to isolate yourself, it's still generally humbling and healing. You get to know yourself, and become familiar with your feelings, and you get to understand your wants and what makes you happy better! It can be nice to be alone sometimes because it leaves us really thinking.
  
  Of course there's times where we need others, and we should seek that if that's the case. But being alone isn't always a bad thing!

  During no emergency level pandemic, I'd say my favorite way to spend a day off would be to get away from the world for a while. No messing with my phone, no hurries to get back to people.. I just want to cast myself away to nature for a while. Go on a hike or traverse through the woods.. just really calming, humbling activities.

   Even with current circumstances, do you have any fun plans for Halloween? 🎃
  ","
  The concept of a Halloween themed family gathering was brought to me, and I did highly consider it. But right now my county is in emergency watch for going into level 4 (highest rank) risk for COVID. And studies have shown that small gatherings ESPECIALLY amongst other households of your family is what is causing much more spread than what was originally thought. So I won't be attending that, or any other public Halloween event. I would be at high risk of fatality because of the other health problems I face. I can't jeopardize my life just for that.

   Which is worse, to be loved by someone you don't love or to love someone who doesn't love you?

  I believe that it's worse to love someone that doesn't love you. Why? Well I feel like the distinction comes in because it's about who's feeling what. It's not as bad to have someone love you that you don't love; you can just distance yourself from them for your own comfort. But feeling unrequited love *directly* hurts you. I feel what's worse is what brings you more pain directly.

If someone has no real chance of survival and they're just suffering to death, I feel that those people should have a right to choose their end.

  I want my account verified just because! It lets people know that I'm a genuine person. On an app full of catfish and fake profiles claiming to be celebrities, it'd be nice to be wholly confirmed so that people don't assume I'm someone I'm not.

862328,"
   Will you stay in a toxic relationship just because you get used to it?
  ","
  Nope! This kind of piggy-backs off of my previous answer buuut the point is just the same: It would be a fat waste of my valuable time. I wouldn't ever want to stay with someone who I believe would be genuinely toxic for me. If a person can't treat other people right, then they shouldn't be getting into relationships. And they certainly don't deserve to be in one with me.
  
  But this should go without saying (generally speaking) : It can be hard for people in abusive relationships to see just how bad the abuse really is. Because like you said, it's wholly possible to get used to it. It's wholly possible to be convinced that THATS what you have, and that's what you'll always have. It's wholly possible to be manipulated into believing so many good things surrounding an abuser because these toxic monsters are so good at what they do: being bad.
  
  So please don't use my answer as a ""gotcha"" for anyone who is in an abusive relationship, or to ridicule anyone who is stuck in one. That would be absolutely unfair and downright sickening. People who are enduring toxicity from a partner or abuse need support, patience, and guidance. Not ridicule. If you know a loved one who is going through this, be supportive. Be kind. Be the light they need to be able to see in the world.
  "
862329,"
   Will you ever try to be in a relationship out of convenience?
  ","
  No, and I really don't see how that's possible! I enter relationships and stay in relationships because of genuine interest. I find those who my heart wants to love and cherish to be always worth my time. But I wouldn't ever put in that kind of time for someone I don't really have interest in.
  
  Why? Well, because it's a waste of my time of course! I value my time, and wouldn't ever waste it on anyone I don't like. Not for any reason. Being in a relationship with a person I don't really like would be quite the massive inconvenience.

  Well, either way! I wouldn't really care to stress myself over people who are crappy. It wouldn't be worth my time or energy to, because I know the people who I hate, hate me plenty enough back to never do the same. It's best that way.

  JK Rowling is a garbage human being from what I've heard. Transphobia is sickening, and I don't tolerate transphobic people in any sense.

  Are you seriously putting a sick freak's fet¡sh (yes I'm referring to ¡ncest) next to being transgender?? Being someone who can't help who they are deep down inside?? Do you genuinely feel as though nasties that fxck their family members being RIGHTFULLY shamed even nearly compares to being harassed for simply being Who You Are? Get out of here.
  
  I don't know what Rowling said about fam-fxckers — never heard about that. But you (general sense or heaven forbid I actually have to refer to YOU) are not at ALL oppressed for wanting to inbreed. Transgender people actually face real problems. lncestuous freaks do not. ""lncestophobia"" is not real.

  Now, I've been doing my best to skew my perspective on the world's populous as a whole to be more positive. I can have a bad habit of getting cynical about people, and I've made so much progress in that!
  
  And then.. 2020. This year happened, covid hit the states, and I've been more cynical towards people because honestly? It's true. The pandemic has brought out the worst in people, and brought the worst people out!

   You ignore my questions! 🤯
  ","
  HEYYY I never ignore questions! Rather, I make paces through my ask box and answer the ones I feel like I can get to at that time. I still have asks from three months ago that I've yet to get to.. A lot of my reasons for skipping around are that, and I want to dedicate proper time to thoroughly answer thought provoking questions. I'd hate to just shove out answers that weren't interesting, just for the sake of ""answering"" them! It'd take the fun out of it for everyone involved. If I'm to engage with the community on this app, I want to be sure I have the dedicated time to do it right on a case by case basis.

  Hi there! How's it going?
  "
862367,"
   Have you ever been zorbing? Would you ever go?
  ","
  UMM I don't know what zorbing even is! Never heard of the term until I read this. So my answer to the first question is definitely No.
  
  •  •  •
  
  OKAY so I looked it up, and here's what I found: ""Zorbing (also known as globe-riding, sphereing, orbing) is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb, typically made of transparent plastic. Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope but can also be done on a level surface, permitting more rider control.""
  
  SOo basically.. Riding a human sized hamster ball?? YEAH I'M IN, I'd do it in a heartbeat if I could. That sounds so fun!

   What is the most desirable trait another person can possess?
  ","
  HONESTY. I'm not talking about the bastardized definition of it, where people seem to think being bluntly rude equates to honesty. I mean the REAL meaning of honesty: being expressive about their thoughts and feelings, being openly communicative, letting others know what's *really* going on with them, not lying just because it's ""easier"". I could go on but I think the picture is painted proper. Honesty is desirable in anyone I intend on speaking with, regardless of intention.

And you could theme your profile in similar ways to how you could on Old ""GOOD"" MySpace. I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure it's gone, at least I thought it was the last I checked.. Bummer.
  
  But yeah! I have to agree with your side note! Carrd is really confusing to work with. It took me ages to figure out how to set up mine and even then, I only set up a ""basic"" looking site on there. It's something that I'd imagine takes a lot of time to really work with and get accustomed to!

  There's actually a lot that I like to do when it rains, but I primarily have two halves of me that favor certain activities over others. Half of me wants to favor drinking tea and reading in pure, blissful silence (other than the rain pitter-pattering against the house) — then half of me wants to run around outside and just feel it wash over me. No one's usually going around outside when it rains so the hyper active part of me craves spinning around in my backyard, judgment free, just enjoying having fun in peace.

  Oh goodness I ABSOLUTELY LOVE pumpkin pie! It's a really cozy dessert. I've unfortunately never had the privilege of making it myself, but I've always wanted to learn how. Desserts that involve pumpkin are pretty much the best part of autumn! Pumpkin pie, pumpkin roll, pumpkin spiced drinks.. I'm hungry now.

   does it really got better, or do we just get used to it?
  ","
  I truthfully believe that the going gets easier over time! Whether or not it's part of us ""getting used to it"" is totally situational, but I for the most part hold the belief that things just get better. There is so much good in the world to experience to keep stuck in the mindset that things won't ever change!
  
  I used to struggle a lot with shifting this mentality around, but it was over the passage of time that I was able to. I don't think it was from getting used to my problems, though. I think that more or less, I got into the ""it gets better"" mindset by surviving through all of my struggles. Getting through those troubles made me stronger, more aware, and more level headed so that I might cope. And now that I'm better at coping, I have the ability to strive for better. It just takes time.

  My favorite thing to do in the fall is hike around wooded areas and observe the way nature is taking to the change of the seasons! I like to see the changing of the trees, and watch animals prepare for the colder months to come. At least, that's what comes to mind for outdoor activity.
  
  Much more boOoring, indoors... I like to brew seasonal hot teas, read, snuggle up in blankets, play games, ehh etc etc. You get the picture.

   why do good people still struggle and experience bad stuff?
  ","
  An important part of coping in hard times is first understanding this: pain and suffering do not correlate to who we are as people. A lot of people find themselves in such deep hurt that they spiral down a path of taking it out on themselves. Holding the belief that one simply ""must have earned it"" to be going through hard times is an example of this.
  
  I promise, no matter how much agony you're shouldering, it's not a punishment. It's not happening because you did something wrong. In truth, bad things happen to everyone, good or bad. It's important to understand that it's all a part of life. Life is full of ups and downs, and unfortunately we all sometimes go through those downs! Some of us go through it harder than others, but all the same it's not a direct stab at us from the universe when it happens.
  
  Unfortunately there's no real ""how"" or ""why"" answer to satisfy this question. What matters is that we don't take it out on ourselves or others, and that we do our best to keep moving forward. I hope you find healing soon.
  "
862413,"
   Why do we put ""HAHA"" or ""LOL"" in our sentence even if the situation is not funny?
  ","
  I feel like a lot of people have a bad habit of doing that to try and dissolve tension. I've let a few people I talk to know before, ""That's a little weird"". They usually say something along the lines of how they don't know how to appropriately approach things, and they don't know what to say. But they have to know and understand that it's not a healthy way of communicating, and learn how to drop it. Habits like that don't allow you to develop your social skills.

   What do you do when someone is being irritating?
  ","
  I've got to be honest and tell them about it. Genuinely, most of the time if a friend or someone you know is being annoying they usually aren't aware of it. So I use an honest, but kind approach for *friends* particularly. ""Hey, you're doing (X) and it's a little upsetting. Can you tone it down a little?"" — something like that! Have never had a problem with that.
  
  If, however, it's a total stranger being irritating.. they are usually doing it on purpose. I'm not afraid of being a little more blunt. Not harsh, not brutal: just *blunt*. Forward. These people are usually in surprise that someone as soft in appearance as me can be that way so that usually ends it. If by chance they continue, I hope they enjoy being ignored. They're not worth the time or energy of even being recognized beyond that point.

   How do you feel about plastic surgery? Do you want/need to have it someday?
  ","
  Plastic surgery is not for me. I don't (personally) like the concept of getting my natural appearance altered artificially. The thought of someone sculpting me with tools and flesh and fat makes me.. a little ill. I already sometimes don't recognize myself when I do simple new things with my hair, or wear different clothes. That can sometimes make me dissociative alone. So I couldn't imagine what going through plastic surgery would do to me mentally.
  
  HOWEVER, however. I do support anyone who feels that they want to explore getting surgically done up! It's your body, and your life, and ultimately your decision. People should be allowed to do with their bodies as they want, so long as it's nothing seriously harmful to them.

  I don't have kids, and I am adamant on staying that way. And hell, I've been adamant on that even since I WAS a kid myself! The concept of having kids, whether through conceiving or through adoption is not at all appealing to me. Having kids doesn't line up with any of my ideals in life. And I'd never bring a child into my world, which is a world I've not built around the concept of them and their future.

   Do you believe in destiny/karma? Do you think people get what they deserve, or is the world more unfair?
  ","
  It's hard to 100% believe in forces that directly alter our realities; I continously have a back and forth about this within myself. I feel.. maybe that I don't believe in destiny and karma in their root definitions.
  
  Like, karma is supposed to be something good or bad happening as a *direct result* of a prior action, right? And I mean not something as simple as someone committing crimes and getting the ""karma"" of being arrested. I mean that's more predictable. I'm talking more or less two completely unrelated scenarios happening.
  
  For example, someone breaks a heart. They get their heart broken in the future. Can we really believe that that's the universe's punishment? It sounds all too.. coincidental. I think the concept of karma, or people ""getting what they've earned"" is a comforting one. But it's hard to fully, 100% believe in it all.

  Women's shoes (especially fancy / ""dress"" shoes) are often created with the most impractical design. They're not made to accommodate the wearer for much activity other that swift, smooth, elegant footsteps. Most particularly, the type of shoes Cinderella was wearing.
  
  They're referred to as ""slippers"" because that's what they do: slip. They aren't made with an ankle or over-the-foot strap, solely for the convenience of being able to ""slip"" the shoes on and off. That being said, it'd be easy to lose one in fast paced activity, such as when she was running. Sucker just *pop*! Slipped right off. There's nothing to keep it in place!

  No, I don't think we should ever have to forgive someone who hurt us. The concept that we absolutely *have to* forgive and forget ""in order to heal"" is incredibly toxic. No one should have to put themselves at risk for being hurt again just to be ""the better person"". The most healing thing one can do is forget our enemies to begin with. They are unimportant. It's better for an individuals personal health to move forward instead of looking back; to strive for better.

   do gadgets control us or do we control gadgets?
  ","
  We control gadgets. Inanimate objects are physically incapable of being in control of us. The only thing that manipulates what we do and how long we do something is attachment and addiction. The device itself isn't controlling us. It isn't forcing us to use it. It isn't holding us hostage. When someone gets really into using their tech, it's either because they're attached to their networks or they thrive from whatever they get out of it. When something gives you a grand amount of satisfaction, often like nothing else could, it's hard to put down. That's where the loss of control comes in: solely within the individual.
  
  SO basically, this notion that our devices control us absolves responsibility of the individual. It instead puts blame on the device for how much we use it. It's important to move the focal point to Ourselves. And if necessary, make adjustments on just how reliant we are on these devices.

  I think it really all depends! There is some people who put more work into their vehicle than others. There's most people, who stick with their stock setup and appearance on their vehicles. Primarily because it's often seen as a financial luxury to go all out on revamping your car. Those people you can't really tell much about! Not financial status, not much of anything!
  
  However, if I see a chrome painted car with tinted windows and colored LED lights I'm gonna think ""wow, they must have a lot of money, they must be really well off, they must be passionate about their appearance and the vibes they give off"". But I don't think I can read a person much further than that, just based off of their vehicle alone.

  ","
  From a moralistic standpoint, I don't really agree with it. I feel like it absolves the home owner of personal responsibility from their own messes. As someone who has worked in cleaning, I have seen this firsthand.
  
  Essentially, once a person knows they have someone to come in and magically poof away the mess, they feel careless and free to be piggish. Messes are a problem of the past to these people. They act more careless with their very own spaces because they know they no longer have to. They're paying someone else to care, after all. Basically that's the kind of attitude these people who pay for personal cleaning services seem to carry.
  
  I just feel like it's important for a person to be responsible for what they've done. Like, why make a mess for someone else to fix? So long as you're physically able, I think you (not personal, I mean general ""you"") should clean your own messes. It keeps you active, and in healthy mindsets. It keeps you from becoming a slob that is reliant on helping hands to do work for you.

  I have a tendency to curse under my breath a whole lot more. Which can be kinda risky because I can let it slip at work,, and I have a few times only to find out that there were still people there,, and even though they don't say anything I just KNOW they heard me,,,,,
  
  It's not like I ever let anything more slip than the occasional ""fuck"" or ""shit"". Maybe a dash of ""dammit"" every so often.. but I still hate letting people witness me being frustrated.

  I think that the scariest thing about the internet is how a lot of bad people use it as a safe haven. There's plenty of freaks who use places that allow them the guise of anonymity to indulge in illegal activity. Most especially, I'm talking about the dark web. Like I mean, there's places there dedicated to trafficking, placing hits on people, hosting pictures/videos of people dying (or who are dead).. you get the idea. Basically, the internet has some very dark corners that should never be visited.

  You can't extend your trust so easily. It's better to take precautions than to fix a huge mess later on because you accidentally misplaced your trust.

Your troubled stories can become someone else's jokes and gags at their next meet up with their Real friends. That stuff sucks.

   Is it a bad thing to tell little lies
  ","
  All lies are bad lies. If you keep on sprinkling in lies everywhere instead of the truth, you (general) may even begin to have a hard time telling what's real and what's fabricated. Letting ""little"" lies slip out every so often is a very slippery slope. Plus, if the lies are so ""little"", then how bad could the truth really be? It's better to just be honest. You'll have a lot of mess to clean up later if you fabricate every other thing..

  When I was a teenager, I was the quiet but edgy type. I was a loner, I stuck to myself, I had interests virtually no one could relate to (besides my few nerdy friends who liked anime), I was big into creepypasta characters for a while there.. Anyways that was my *early* teen years (around 13-16). I made significant changes in my personality and character from late 16 and onwards. I feel that this was my biggest development period as a teen, because I grew confidence and bravery until those were my stronger points. I dealt with a lot of rough things around that period that my newfound strength helped me fight through.

   Would you rather meet a wolf or a poisonous snake in the wilderness?
  ","
  DEFINITELY a poisonous snake. You know, wolves are actually freaking GIGANTIC.. idk what happened or how I thought this, but for most of my life I thought they were much smaller than they actually are. They're very large animals, and plus? They move in packs. I'd be dead for sure if I ran into a wolf.
  
  But with a snake, with its size, I feel like it'd be much easier to survive an encounter. Running isn't recommended if you're super close, but if necessary one would be easy to sling away or kill. At least much easier than it would be to defend yourself against wolves.

  Death of loved ones, including the animals I care for. I don't need any more loss this year; hell NOOO, no thank you. Though I suppose that's more of a perpetual anxious worry than a fear.. hm.

I want to be sure I'll have the time to get back to every question participating in that, just so no one feels ""left out"" if that makes sense.
  
  Basically, I'm considering setting up ""honesty week"" instead of ""honesty hour"" to really maximize engagement with the community!
  
  When I do figure out how I want to set it up, I'll make an announcement post on the weekend prior. And if anyone misses that post, I'll have my display name set up to remind anyone who comes to my profile what's going on. So do keep a look out!

   Do you think you get more mature by getting older?
  ","
  Yes, and no. Or, rather.. yes and THEN for most people there's a stopping point in that maturing. Allow me to explain.
  
  The more we age, the more we are able to experience! Relationships, exploration, individuality, independence, you name it. We gain a lot of knew knowledge with new experiences. And most life changing experiences happen as we age through adulthood. But for a lot of people there's a stunt in their mental growth and maturity when they reach a certain point. It can be a lack of willingness to do new things, or a level of comfort with where a person is at. Or, a complete disinterest in working on things that make us better.
  
  UGH I could have put this more simply I think, and when I re-read your question I keep thinking I'm going about this the wrong way. My bad! I think what I'm trying to say is: yes, you do mature a lot more as you age. But there's a lot of people who aren't willing to be mature about certain things about themselves in order to *keep* maturing.

  I don't feel like there's any kind of secret to having healthy and happy partnerships! I just feel like there's things that are common knowledge that too many of us neglect. And whether or not that's a lack of care or a lack of interest is dependant on the person neglecting their love and love life.
  
  I think that what you need for a happy and healthy partnership (or partnerships) is finding a person you really connect with. An honest connection truly helps all that other good stuff that a relationship needs to flourish, come naturally! These needs are: love, compassion, care, kindness, understanding, and trust! These things can't be forced. If there's no honest connection first, there's no sense in the rest.

   does growing up change your body or also your soul?
  ","
  Growth isn't ever just a physical thing! Everything invested in you changes; mind, body, and spirit. As we age, we all experience a plethora of different things that tailor us into who we become. Gaining friends, making enemies, loving, losing: these are some of the biggest things that change what's on the inside as we grow. And as long as a person keeps on exploring new things, and new possibilities, I truly believe there's no stop in growth. Some people out of ignorance *choose* not to search for internal growth, however, and that's the unfortunate disconnect. But that's them. For me, however, I'll always consider myself a work in progress. Up until my very death.

   Somebody may falsely accuse you. Somebody may see something that was not there.

  There's plenty of things people could accuse you of that are illegal. Theft, murder, you name it. That doesn't mean that there shouldn't be laws against these things, solely because of the fact that someone could lie and misrepresent you to the face of the law. These laws are in place to encourage others to abide by them, and to keep people secure. The law itself is not the issue, the people who would supposedly be accusatory that I (I'm assuming you via your apparent self projection) had broken the law would be the problem.
  
  Also, side note but still VERY related.. how long are you gonna persist on sending this to people?? I swear through any account I've ever had on here, I have had the misfortune of you landing in my inbox. And each time I always see you pulling this argument. No! Be done. Seek help.

  ","
  If you recently made your account (and I'm talking within the last month)... the honest truth is that you signed up at the wrong time. 😔 It used to be much easier to earn coins (🔥) until just recently. Staff changed the coin earning game to make it much more of a challenge. You used to be able to earn +5 per every direct question of yours that someone asked you. Now the only ways to earn coins is by people gifting you them, you watching ads, or you buy them (with real money, which I'd NEVER recommend). It kinda sucks, but I suppose it levels the leader boards with a little more fairness. Maybe it was a move to stop people from ""cheating the system""..?

   I act differently depending on the people around me. Am I fake?
  ","
  I don't think that's outwardly fake, no. If anything I feel like it depends on the reason you're doing it..? Or maybe you don't have a reason for it. I feel like social adaptation is often inadvertently something we all do. It's almost a knee jerk reaction for us to be people-pleasers in our social lives, because pleasing others keeps them around. And keeping people you like around pleases you.
  
  Overall, it would be one thing if you were doing it to be spiteful to these ""different people"" behind their backs and act like they're strangers when you're with others. However if you're doing it as a natural response, or to keep others happy, I don't necessarily think that's ""fake"". You're taking in the information around you and adapting based on what you come up with in that case.

  I feel as though it's highly inconsiderate because that's basically sibling hopping. It's usually what someone does when they're confused on what they really want. Plus I mean, it's almost an insult to your ex. She'll have to sit there miserable watching you court her sister, who she'll likely have a falling out with because she is with her ex. So not only will your ex have lost a partner, but also she would have lost a sister. That's pretty low honestly.

   How would you describe your partners?
  ","
  THIS IS SUCH A CUTE QUESTION FOR YOU TO ASK!! 🌸💞🥺 I'll describe them a bit, using my emoji key (for the sake of their individual comfort levels)...
  
  👽 - 28, he/him. He's like.. a true cryptid on the inside but is a total teddy bear on the outside. He has an interest in weird phenomenon and strange aesthetics. Very tech savvy to nearly the point of obsession (but I love him for it). Quite honestly he's the smartest person that I've ever known, and I've been fortunate enough to know him for nearly TEN YEARS NOW!! He's on the quiet side and won't say much unless prompted, but when he speaks his feelings you can feel it in your heart that he means it deeply and truly. He has a lot of love to give and I'm fortunate enough to be the sole recipient of that love. And I'm lucky that I get to know him more than anyone else. He's golden hearted.
  
  🍀 - 27, he/him. The most charasmatic and fun person on the face of the planet. Definitely outwardly flamboyant and proud of it (and super cute for it). He's got so many stories and jokes to tell, and always references his favorite interests. Like, even down to obscure specific quotes from songs or shows. He has a memory that seems to record EVERYTHING, it's honestly impressive. And as big as his brain is, his heart is ten times the size with how sweet he is. He's truly a romantic person; always links me songs that make him think of me, makes me collages based off of my aesthetics to match with the selfies I send him, and helps me any way he can. He's so SWEET.
  
  🤼‍♂️ - 27, he/him. Fighting game enthusiast with every single cell in his body. He's all about Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Combat. Actually, he's been to a couple of fighting game tournaments this year alone to participate and go head to head with some of the top local players. But outside of his passion for the FGC and fighting games in general, he's a person full of love but shrouded in mystery. Our relationship is much more casual-- (OUT OF SPACE)

   How old do you think you are mentally, is it different than your physical age?
  ","
  Personally I altogether feel the same age that I do physically; 22! A lot of people can easily pin down what they feel like mentally, but I overall can't think of a way to answer. Because, what really makes out ""mental"" age? Does it have to do with interests? Your personality type? Your level of intellect? That's all so complicated xkshdhhs I just know I'm me. And my body is 22. I don't think my core interest/mindsets have changed much in the past few years (maybe not even since I was 18). But I've gained a lot of knowledge and insight on the world since then, and that all makes me feel mentally aged enough.
  
  This was a really good question! 🌸 But maybe some day I can come up with a more conclusive answer to it, and not think too deeply on it JDHSHS

   What is  the purpose of love???
  ","
  Love has many purposes! First it's important that we separate the words ""love"" and ""romance"" if we are going to grasp any base understanding, however. Because while romance can be motivated by love, the two aren't the same! Love by itself is to feel intense care for something or someone.
  
  I feel like the purpose of love itself is  to be an influence on one's whole life. Love connects us to the places we live, the locations we favor, the people we make our friends, those we choose to be partnered with, etc. Most of the choices that we make revolve around it. Love is a feeling that helps us find out what we want to surround ourselves with, and it helps us know what makes us ultimately happy.
  
  Do I feel like love of any kind should be the only guiding compass in our subset of emotions? No. But I do feel like it plays one of the most significant roles in choice making and path taking. We are a curious species, brought into this world to give and receive over and over again until we are Done. With love influencing so much, it's one of the key elements that make that cycle continue.

  ","
  I used one of my favorite text generating websites!
  

   https://yaytext.com/mini-me/
  

  The one I used is called ""mini stacked"", and you have to put in what you want like this:
  
  top small text
  
  bottom normal text
  
  And the generator will turn the text on top into tiny text! But do be aware: not every letter of the alphabet stacks neatly above the regular sized text! Some letters will dip below because they don't have a tiny unicode version. Also, your top word should probably be smaller than or the same length as your bottom word to avoid more character dipping.

  What comes to mind is the homeless woman who helped me find my way, my first time traveling by myself. I was going to Illinois to visit with my partner for a little while, and I was going by megabus. We were just dropped off on (what seemed to be) just some random road. And it was pouring rain. Everyone else seemed to know where they were going but I was lost. I was in a massive city with a bunch of luggage, all by myself.
  
  Eventually a woman comes up and asks for some money. She said she's trying to make her way to a woman's shelter to escape from an abusive situation. I gave her some money. I think she could tell I was new around because I looked a whole mess. She offered her spare jacket to me, and told me the ways I need to go to get to my destination. She even stopped our Uber later on when she saw me to make sure that I was safe and with someone I wanted to be with. I said yes, and we parted ways.

   Why do some people compartmentalize their actions from who they are as a person because they believe actions don't define you

  I think this behavior links to people having a very narrow sighted view of themselves. They don't take into account how their actions could be hurtful. They take only into account how they see themselves. And by that I mean, they seem to think they're far above their actions.

   So my boyfriend's ex-wife/babymomma wants to get back together with him. She flirts via text and sends titty pics. How do I get her to stop?
  ","
  This isn't just an issue with your partners ex-wife. This is absolutely an issue with your partner too, maybe even more than it is an issue with his ex-wife. All modern smartphones have the ability to block someone else's sms number. To me it doesn't seem like *he* wants *her* to stop. He's either entertaining wanting her back on the low, or just plain stupid. Either way? This situation these two are putting you in is hurtful to you. I wouldn't fight to stay with someone like your partner. You deserve better. I hope some day you put this mess behind you and seek the goodness you deserve. Have a good day.

   Do you like the cracking sound of eggshells?
  ","
  I've never put too much thought behind it but you know what? Yeah, I kind of do! Some odd years back I always used to make myself omelettes for breakfast every other morning. And when I'd crack an egg against the side of my bowl I'd be happy to be able to split the halves and pour the egg in. Also the sound when the egg splits open is just 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌 SATISFYING. Like ""ahh, I didn't crack it into pieces, it opened just right"".
  "
862820,"
   ""jumpscares""? Wow!! The first time I watched a horror movie I had popcorn all over the place. After that, I soon liked many horror movies.
  ","
  I think that's a pretty valid reaction! Some movies can get you good even with the cheapest of scare tactics. It all depends on the type of person. For me it usually takes deep psychological horror to make me feel truly ""scared"". But there's plenty of people who get scared from pop scares, and that's enough for them.
  
  I personally don't watch many movies, so I don't look for horror movies often. I love what the horror genre has to offer for art, however! Things like standalone pieces, or comics and manga.

  I see dreams as a way for your unconscious mind to display everything that's been on your plate for a while. Dreams can show you your love, your fear, your wants, your hopes, your deepest feelings.. so when you see someone who has passed away in a dream, I think that your brain is just trying to give you another chance to see them. Or to visualize how loss truly makes you feel.

   What is your favorite anime and why?
  ","
  My most recent favorite anime is Beastars. It's one that I more recently (within the last year) got into, and I've rewatched it 1½ times! I enjoy it for the interesting spin on how animals with humanlike sentience behave in a world bound by instinct of predator and prey. The psychological elements intrigue me, and the characters interest me. Plus the animation style is unique!
  
  My ALL TIME favorite anime is Inuyasha, however. It was my first anime. I was a tiny, restless tot that woke up one time at 5am. I wanted to see what was on the TV, so I turned it on and went to Cartoon Network. That's when I discovered Adult Swim, Toonami, and an anime with a temperamental dog eared boy from the feudal Era who said ""bad words"" on TV. 🤭

   So I’m pregnant and I really have been thinking about just disappearing out of the city away from everyone. Would I be wrong to ghost my child’s father to?
  ","
  If being pregnant is sincerely making you feel like leaving everything behind and running away from the life you currently have (dangerous, do not do this), I think you should sit and think about why that is. And perhaps consider the possibility that maybe having a child isn't right for you. If it isn't too late in your pregnancy, I would have an abortion. If you carry this child and go off to live a life of uncertainty by yourself, you'll be giving your child a hard life. That's not a kind of situation to bring a new life into. It's okay to be scared and not be ready to be a parent. It's normal. But there are options out there for you so that you don't have to be a parent if you're not ready. Stay safe.

  Society as a whole would not benefit from just one person, part of the reason is because human is human, everyone makes their own decisions, different decisions. some don't want to learn from others thinking that it would hurt their egos. society will always have people thinking option a is correct while others will think option b is. it will always be split.

   Is being obsessive about someone or something a good thing?
  ","
  Its a double edge sword. Being obsessive about someone could have downfalls, you could push them away as the worse thing. Usually an obsession comes from a need that’s not being met or they have trust issues. being obsessive about something has its positives and its pitfalls, deciding whether you are truly willing to go the distance is the hard question to answer. Being obsessed with someone, I truly believe is not a healthy way to live life, just all too many negatives.
  "
863358,"
   Is living life to the fullest possible?
  ","
  It is, but it depends on how you are treating your life. if one cares about what others think about you or trying to please everyone then you will have a rough time. so you can't do that, never feel inferior to anyone because no one is perfect. Family, friends, do not forget them. We all have priorities in life, but one should not forget to allocate time for their loved ones. don't be a puppet being controlled by the politics, corporations, news media, even cults. No one should dictate the terms of what you should try and take in life. last but not least, Treat Yourself. everyone needs self heal every once in a while, we are like a computer and sometimes we need a refresh and reboot.
