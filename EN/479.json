In case of IR, the beta cells will keep producing insulin. Even after the muscle and fat cells become resistant to insulin, the pancreas will keep producing more insulin to help the body cells absorb the glucose that has accumulated in the bloodstream. On the other hand, diabetes occurs when the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin or the body becomes resistant to insulin. However, in the long run, IR can lead to prediabetes, which, if not treated, can progress to diabetes. There is no evidence to show why some people develop insulin resistance while others develop a sensitivity to insulin.\"\n  ","513996":"\n  wonderful\n  ","513997":"\n  Why are you sharing your cat's pooping schedule? \ud83d\ude02\n  ","513998":"\n  arm and leg\n  \n  wouldn't surprise me if chest was bigger on the right either \ud83d\ude02\n  ","513999":"\n  uncle if his Dad's twin was going to be male.
