lol","317011":"yassss","317012":"i m happy , but my back is hurting so that s irritating , i m looking forward to seeing my horses tomorrow and having a good dinner","317013":"someone that you can sense that they know a lot , the way they talk about interesting true stuff going on in this world","317014":"puppies ! ! !","317015":"thank you !","317016":"oh my gosh , i know ! ! ! she s awesome","317017":"haha thanks","317018":"just depends ! sometimes !","317019":"oh my , thank you ! !","317020":"they attempt to guilt you and make you do something , but little do they know is guilt doesn t work on me","317021":"yes , se ual har ssment , talking about people in a movie and just being disrespectful","317022":"doesn t matter .","317023":"oh noooooo , probably the one wish right now","317024":"depends what the law was and how close i was to them , probably not unless i m like in love with them","317025":"more work possibly lol","317026":"thoughts per minute , feeling blanked minded sometimes and distracted thoughts lol","317027":"earth or fire earth because i love nature and think it s beautiful and just the best fire because i have a quick fuse , depends on who it is , but i can be quick to anger and have a short temper","317028":"not yet , i haven t !","317029":"i mean i would respect them , but probably would never date someone that was afraid of them since horses are my entire lifestyle","317030":"yasss , i actually pre ordered a game called story of seasons friends of mineral town","317031":"yes , it definitely is great to have !","317032":"nope","317033":"someone who is honest , sweet , cute , loyal , someone who plays video games and would eventually wanna come out to the barn with me","317034":"lol . . what do you mean","317035":"probably about or a bit over , to be honest lol","317036":"haha why thank you !","317037":"i ve done it before , just depends on the sofa . at one of my sisters houses it s super comfy , my other one i wake up and my arms asleep . it just depends i also usually have cats laying with me","317038":"nahhhh , rather be taking care of my horse then being girly ! though if i m going somewhere nicer , i ll wear a dress","317039":"haha thanks ! !","317040":"there is no sense of freedom equal to what i feel when i am riding my horse","317041":"yasssss , i hate it","317042":"that sounds nice and relaxing !","317043":"i love waking up early , but being able to do nothing and be lazy lol","317044":"yeah . . like if someone close with me wanted me to take a few photos of them or stuff like that i would , but for other stuff i m good at i like if i was good at drawing or something like that , i wouldn t just draw stuff for free if someone random asked . just using that as an example , i don t really draw","317045":"it s just so relaxing tbh","317046":"in my car yes , what about you ?","317047":"that s good !","317048":"yeah , i love buying stuff for her i swear i spend more money on her then i do on myself lol","317049":"just because i m good at something would not mean i would do it for free , because that s still a lot of time and effort spent doing it . when i went to horse shows more , i used to take photos of people from our barn showing and then my mom would print it and give them to them . but that s bc i m close with them and they used to help us out with stuff similar","317050":"when someone attempts to guilt you to try doing something you don t wanna do at all , like send photos , or send money this is an example , someone actually send me this to try and keep money in my bank account bc he was having issues with his","317051":"yeah no clue what it is","317052":"yes ! ! like i ve borrowed money from my mom , but i pay back when i m able to get the money ! ! i hate when people are like oh it s only much money , you don t need it ! like no , i didn t give it to you , i want it back . so now i don t let people borrow money thanks rikkii i found her on facebook lol","317053":"oh yeah , for sure ! i try not to spend much unless it s on my horse lol","317054":"what do you exactly mean by that ?","317055":"yeah definitely ! ! and it s not like we owe anyone an explanation why i won t give them money , it s like i earned it and worked hard","317056":"i love having photos taken of me","317057":"what . . ?","317058":"oookkaayyy ? then why do you hope to see me after the pandemic if we don t know each other . . ?","317059":"thank you , you too ! !","317060":"yuuuuppppppppp","317061":"uhh who are you . . ? do i know you . . ?","317062":"lol thanks ! but yeah that sucks karma will get back at them for taking the money . but i won t let people borrow from me anymore !","317063":"well that s understandable ! i just wont lend it to friends and such","317064":"it was about at a time once , then it added to over so i don t let people borrow money anymore bc i m not just giving it to anyone","317065":"definitely dog !","317066":"a friend i worked with a couple years ago , i don t talk to her anymore and i don t regret it . she borrowed over and never paid me back , so i stopped letting her borrow money , i never got it back and never talked to her again . so i feel that that would be accurate .","317067":"nahhh","317068":"thanks !","317069":"like i said earlier . i don t dream .","317070":"what","317071":"ah
