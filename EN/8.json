End of discussion!\n  ","8760":"\n  Pfft! *That got Reaper to laugh and mod is laughing for completely different reasons*\n  \n  *I'm thinking of that episode of Robot Chicken where they called Voldemort Lord moldy butt XD and everytime you said that he farted*\n  ","8761":"\n  If Life told him about you he might but I know I haven't told all the others about you yet, I've been a lazy bones about it..\n  \n  *Reaper says as he travels over to his version of Hotland that honestly looked like a forest out of a fairytale only thing is, there was a fire barrier surrounding the entrance, oddly it didn't burn anything or so it appears*\n  \n  To get through here is gonna be tricky, it doesn't look like it burns anything but *Reaper sets Geno down for a moment so he can pick up a rock and toss it into the barrier, the rock burns away into ash on impact* You'll get more than a few burns if you aren't careful\n  ","8762":"\n  Hotland..?? Oh right..it's called that in the other timelines, here it's called Sanctuary, it's the place where Grillby, the God of Hearth lives and..it's a lot different than the Hotland you know, here it's called Sanctuary cause it's really similar to Lifes garden *Geno must be very shocked* Only problem is Grillby has a fire barrier surrounding the place..I know how to get through it though..you wanna go see it?\n  ","8763":"\n  It's better to have Death watching your back Love *Reaper winks as he continues carrying him along* if C\u0336\u0350\u0353\u0324h\u0334\u0343\u035d\u0312\u0360\u0328a\u0337\u034b\u0323r\u0338\u0315\u035ca\u0337\u031b\u0316\u0326 .. *Reaper pauses as he noticed he wasn't able to say her name now without his voice glitching* ...
