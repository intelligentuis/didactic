  ","
  Very stressful. High school doesn't last forever. So you have to make the most of it. But don't do stupid stuff, just to impress people. Really people don't care what you do. My advice is try not to do stuff that could ruin your life. Don't pur your problems on other people. Most of us don't care. High school is a fun experience. Just make sure you keep up your grades. You don't want to slack off your freshman year, because it will hurt you later on in life. These last 4 years of school are important. So make them count!👌✊😊😊

  Exams are way more than important updating photos. If you were lazy you wouldn't prepare for exams. It's obvious you want to pass them.. Maybe if you do have time when you are done preparing maybe you can do it.. Most likely you probably won't.. She should understand that. She'll have the same problem at some point..

   Any advice for studying?
  ","
  I for one don’t study at all. However that changed when I hit college. For me what I feel helps is definitely going over practice problems and drilling the step by step procedure until I have it memorized. Granite this isn’t good for remembering it long term but it helps for tests and quizzes. Also I recommend going to office hours or asking your teacher/professor for help. Trust me they’ll be your best friend when you reach out to them because it shows you’re trying to do your best.

   I want to get my sisters a puppy, but she is still grieving for the loss of her dog that past away 8 years ago. Urn with dog ashes are are on her bed and I don’t know how to get her out of it. I suggested a new dog but she is absolutely no attitude. But yet she cannot sleep. Any suggestions?
  ","
  Mhm that’s really hard to say. So in my life I had 9 dogs in my life. 5 which passed away due to age. For all my dogs that passed we got them a urn for there ashes and a stone engraved with there name as a rememberance for them. As hard as it is to move on from a death of an animal it’s similar to a heartbreak. Yes you grieve a lot during it but in the future there’s a chance for the empty space in your heart to be filled again

   What gaming system do you think is the best? And do you have one?
  ","
  This question is like a political debate. Personally I love playstation. I’ve been with playstation ever since ps1. Now I have all gaming systems like Xbox, GameCube, psp, game boy, snes, etc. however I think when it comes to how a game runs I think PC is the best option for that. However I don’t have the free time I used to to play video games so to build a PC that will dominate for about $3,000 is just a waste of money for me. So I just stick with getting the new PlayStation and Xbox consoles when they come out about every 7-8 years

  ","
  Yea for sure. All I ask is that if you are interested please don’t waste my time cause remember this is a business for me. It’s basically my only source of income. So each time I spend explaining the program and showing the results does take time out of my day especially with my studies.

  ","
  So fitness programs is my own side business. It’s extra income for me because I’m. A full time student in college and I’m in debt so every little bit helps. So the $15 will go towards my school fund. The program itself which if you do buy will be $50 it includes a month full of workout 5-6 times a week plus a meal plan absolutely free. It also includes my personal number if you have any questions about certain exercises.

  No. Those I have on my camera roll on my phone. There might be some pictures of my friends on my Instagram lol but I can’t remember. I haven’t posted on Instagram in awhile due to covid. Just because you’re really nice and you seem like you really want to get results in fitness... I don’t normally do this but I’ll let you buy a month program and I’ll through in a second program free however you’ll have to pay for the second program meal plan which is a small fee of $15

  Created. Let’s take a second to reflect. We learn from what we see from the actions of people we are close too. We see these actions without knowing whether they are used for good or evil.

  Depends... I mean does he know he can have sex with you? Do you show that you want to have sex with him? It’s all factors. Maybe ask him what some of his fantasies are. I really don’t know. Maybe he’s just bored if you guys do the same thing for Sex everytime

   Would you every give her an other chance tho ? I know you have your reasons but , I want your honesty opinion

  But mine isn’t between two girls though. There’s only one girl I currently have feelings for right now and she’s trying to figure out herself whether she’s going to get back with me or her ex. So it’s her who has to make that decision between two guys.

   No it’s between 2 girls

  I don’t have a first girl to go back too. It’s the girl option to choose between me or her ex

  ","
  Do you think it’s fair if I’m in that same situation? When I did a lot more than what her ex did for her in 6 years?
  "
718453,"
   Is that what your doing ?
  ","
  Well actually I’m more on the side of being the 2nd person. The girl I was with is going through what you’re going through however she dated guy 1 for 6 years where we were only together for about 6 months.
  "
718454,"
   But what if they told you that they still loved you. What would you do ? Say you were seeing some at that time but , you broke it off with them because you still care about that other person.
  ","
  Then maybe the best thing for you would to just give yourself time from a relationship and rethink your feelings over for both people
  "
718455,"
   Which one would you go back too ? Number 1 or number 2. Let’s say you were with number 1 for 11 month and number 2 for 6 months

718461,"
   Say you like someone and they liked you back. You dated for a while but , you guys broke up. Then they find out that your in a relationship or it’s other away around. Say they just got out of relationship that person. Why would they quickly go back to them and not you ?

   Basically im 18 and i finally graduated highschool and i realize that life is about to get real and yet i still dont have a clue what i want to do . I have my first job working at McDonalds and dont get paid only 400$ a month and thats not crap i dont want to be here forever! My parents never really
  ","
  Relax. When I was 18 I worked at publix. I only made $200 a month there. I’m in my 3rd year of college and I still work at publix because it’s the only way for me to help pay for my schooling. I recommend after your first year of college depending g on your major try to go out and get internships. Those can normally start you off with a minimum of 12-20 hours a week based on your college schedule and pay raise anywhere from $12-22 an hour. For example I’m an engineering major and I have an internship at universal studios for the fall for design and my starting pay is $21 hours based on my knowledge and the classes I’ve taken and I have to work a minimum of 12 hours and a max of 30. So money is not an issue and your parents should support you to help push you in college to excel

  ","
  You’re over here judging people just by the way their face looks... what makes you different then when people say “why don’t you just buy better clothes, etc.” you’re basically saying that people should get face surgery to have the best looking face.
