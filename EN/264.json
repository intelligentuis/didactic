the function they do not value whatsoever . my demon function is ti , meaning i do not understand why people use that function at all , or how they can even bear it . as such , i hate things like physics with a passion . it also depends on which function other people perceive you as failing in . considering ne is my th function , i struggle with interpreting things correctly a lot of the time . i think someone is speaking to me in a malicious tone when they are not , and go on blocking sprees . someone with high ne , on the other hand , would say something like the possibilities are endless regarding life philosophy , and abide by that in a healthier way . i hate hypotheticals , and when i bother to think of them , they are delusional hypotheticals , if that makes sense ex what if this obese youtuber is actually wearing a fat suit and is truly very skinny ? . . . yes , that s an actual consideration of mine . now , if you are an intp , that would mean you struggle to use se in a healthy way . you can become detached from reality and act insensitive without knowing it . if you are an enfp , that would be ti . that manifests as indecision and issues with having arguments be consistent and logically sound . you may sound convincing from fi , but what you say lacks verifiable substance . you are blind to evidence . an infp would struggle with se , much like an intp but like an isfp myself , they do not care about ti , and even demonize people who utilize it . i made a post the other day about how i hate when people use the phrase self truth , for example . that is me demonizing people with ti . i can t stand it when people suggest facts and the truth can possibly be subjective . so , i would suggest determining which function you demonize in other people . an intp would demonize those who use fi , seeing personal values as useless , as well as absolute self expression . fi , after all , focuses on expressing itself to its greatest abilities . as someone with dominant fi , i go against language conventions in my writing , using verbs as nouns and such . someone with dominant fi does not care if what they do is seen as unconventional or even controversial . they just want to express themselves . an intp would be more rigid and look down upon that sort of thing . but also keep in mind that people can mistake type for fi . if you have in your tritype , it can resemble fi , especially if it is a primary type that is , not a wing . while those with fi and those who are type can both be idealistic and prioritize self expression above everything , is more about appearances than fi . fi does not care about how it is perceived from the outside , but a type person wants to be seen as unique .","244201":"https www . youtube . com watch

else who forgot ? i assume the first one , but the wording could be interpreted either way , so i m not sure . it s understandable to want to help someone , and to worry about them . being in another country can make you feel helpless . you wish you had more control over the situation . but just remember , there are other people caring for this girl your friend ? . so while you cannot be there for her in person , other people are . don t dwell too much on things you have no control over , because dwelling doesn t give you more control , it only makes you lose control of yourself . if you feel very anxious , i would recommend grounding techniques saying something you taste , something you smell , etc . worry about what you can do , not what you can t . what you can do is make yourself feel better .","244203":"there is , to me , no such thing as self truths , only the objective truth . if two people give opposing stories about something , the truth isn t somewhere in between . one of them is telling the truth , simply . if peron a s car was crashed into , that is the objective truth . if the person who crashed their car into the other person s car person b insists that person a was in fact the one who crashed into them , that is not a self truth , that is a lie . but this is hard for people with the ti function to understand . they find everything to be subjective when it isn t . if an apple falls on your head , that s the objective truth . someone can say it didn t happen , or that it was actually a pear . and that is not a self truth . there is no such thing . it s just a fancy way of saying you re a liar , or that you misinterpreted things .","244204":"this is directed at random people . . . just a rant i think it s unfair for anyone to see shakespeare s writing as pretentious . he wrote for the common man , meaning not the upperclass . of course , his plays were difficult to understand at times even for the common man , because he created many of his own words , which are still used today . but that was how people spoke at the time . it is like taking a random book of this time period and saying it s pretentious or so years from now , just because english has advanced past that way of speaking . english has become overly simplified , but you have to take into account how the language was back then , and see shakespeare s works from the perspective of the time period . just because english sucks so much now and you cannot understand his writing doesn t make it pretentious . he wasn t writing for highly intelligent people . you will not , however , find very similar writing to his , precisely because he invented words and wrote in iambic pentameter . i find both of these things to be impressive .","244205":"all the time . i get weird speech issues from my schizophrenia and forget what i was going to say in the middle of saying it , or have a confusing disconnected way of speaking . yesterday our washing machine stopped working and flooded the floor . i meant to ask if i could shower and still put my dirty clothes in the laundry to go in the washing machine . but instead i asked if i could use the washing machine , which made it sound like i was going to be the one doing the laundry . and i just stopped in the middle of saying something , not sure how to end the sentence . i try to be careful with what i say , otherwise i get the wrong thing across . but this carefulness gives people the wrong idea and makes them think i don t have a speech issue . i really do , i struggle to talk .","244206":"it has helped my ocd , and my relationship is in the best condition it s ever been in . i of course have some complaints , like about not being able to go to the amusement park or have a proper vacation . i was in a very shitty state before school got out in march , but i don t think i ve self harmed since then . so is the year i stopped physically harming myself , and my mental and relationship state have both improved .","244207":"not going to college sounds like one of those things . or dropping out of high school . i like the idea of marriage , because weddings seem beautiful . i know some people say it s just a piece of paper , but it s also more convenient on taxes and such . you will also get questioned if you never marry your partner . it s awkward to have a house and kids together but not be married , i think .","244208":"i ll translate and maybe do homework . i also want to finish omori . i was playing it for hours today .","244209":"i think it depends on the location . of course you should not set off fireworks around many trees , for instance . but if it s just a grassy field , or even concrete , i don t see how it d harm animals much . as for the environment , fireworks do emit greenhouse gases , but it s also not like they re being set off every day of the year . it s better for many people to gather together and watch fireworks not during the coronavirus , so they are not individually setting many off . there is less damage that way .","244210":"uh . . . i have a hard time telling someone if they made me sad , so i ghost them . i also interpret many things as being attacks against me , so i block people who probably weren t even saying anything mean . like , if they have a passive aggressive tone of voice , i block them . people have to talk in a very gentle tone of voice to me or i will feel depressed or paranoid . i m also jealous in love . i used to be pretty controlling . i m still controlling when it comes to things such as group projects , and can be domineering . when i m in a good mood , i become insensitive and have little patience for people s complaints . i do not care about giving them sympathy and perceive them as whiny . i feel guilty over minor things , mostly things that are not even my fault .","244211":"pretty good . i love solitude and hate going outside , so quarantine has been great for me . my compulsions from ocd are not bothering me much physically being in school would trigger them again and again . the first three or so months of were terrible . there were some terrible days after those months , as well , but overall has not been the worst year for me .","244212":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v hec eqdlt ab channel kubzscouts","244213":"all the time . i often know who sends things based on how they talk , or if they like the response to that question . but i know the like thing isn t always reliable , because people might just see that answer on their feed and like it without being associated with the question . however , how they talk on their page is usually how they talk in questions , so i can put the two together that way . i do lurk on people s pages sometimes to make these patterns . anyway , sometimes i m too lazy to lurk , so i don t always know . the best indication is emoji use . i pick up on the emojis people like to use .","244214":"i don t think it s that bad for most people . definitely painful , but it goes away . i think it triggered my schizophrenic symptoms , though there is evidence to show that head injuries can cause hallucinations . and it greatly impaired my memory . i don t remember much of anything from , and my short term memory is the worst . it also made me become homicidal for a long time , because the headaches drove me crazy . i still get those headaches , but not as often .","244215":"no problem . here is a terrible picture of the last cat , lol .","244216":"i don t have a pic of all three of them together , but here s two of them .","244217":"people can t handle pain and having someone rely on them . relationships naturally come with pain and conflict , as well as some degree of emotional reliance . many people also hate commitment , so they re quick to leave a relationship if their partner wants it to be serious . many people also seem to not want a meaningful relationship , instead wanting one for validation and the appeasement of loneliness .","244218":"here is one of them .","244219":"because people are selfish in different ways , whether it be monetarily selfish , selfish with belongings , selfish with friends , etc . they aren t selfish in all realms of life . but i would say there is always a motive with helping others , whether it be learning more about humans themselves , making yourself feel or look better , having people be indebted to you , etc .","244220":"eh , it depends on if you mean jealousy or envy . people use the terms interchangeably , but they mean different things . envy is wanting something you can t have i think materialism encourages this emotion . people often assume others are better off than they are , but that s usually not true . so i would say it s also a misunderstanding . as for jealousy , it means you are afraid that what you have will be taken away . people naturally fear abandonment , so jealousy isn t unusual , especially if you have worked hard to get what you have .","244221":"my mom got mad at me for drinking sunny d one time . . . claimed that it s an emergency drink for if grocery stores shut down . but the stores aren t going to shut down . she buys things in a panic and blames us for using what she buys . they become expired because no one is allowed to use them . it s her problem for participating in the panic buying phenomenon . and plus it s sunny d . she could have a child who drinks alcohol , but instead she has one who drinks sunny d . it s not something to get mad about . she s lucky i m not someone who drinks alcohol , vapes , etc . she should be more grateful . as for other things , there was an entire fight not with my mom over me writing a certain line in an essay , which was only a placeholder . i was going to go back and change it . i was threatened over it , and it wasn t even a final draft .","244222":"yeah , anything to make themselves feel better , and to get people to sympathize with them and take their side . they just get away with everything like that . it s sad . you re better off not bothering with it at all . try to disconnect yourself as much as possible . they are just desperate for gossip , and by responding to it you feed into it more . not that not responding makes it any better . it never made anything better for me , but it brings me more peace of mind .","244223":"it s online , not in real life . older people act as if it s as simple as blocking the person , but it isn t . blocking doesn t change the things they say about you , the things they can do to you . it s just censorship , but not an effective form . i had to leave the site i used entirely because it got so bad . then i got doxxed months after leaving . no interaction with people minor interaction with friends , though . you can t escape what happens . i have cptsd because it s an ongoing nightmare . as for why it happens rumors , projections , etc . they will try to destroy your life without it being warranted . and they ll make you out to be the perpetrator , the harasser , when it s them . it s awful . i m an extremely conflict averse person , so it s even worse for me .","244224":"a support system . it doesn t necessarily have to come from a lover , nor a family member , nor a friend . it can be anyone , even a cat . whatever makes you feel better when you re upset or stressed . whatever keeps you stable and makes you happy . that s more important than money . yes , money provides financial support , but it cannot provide the same emotional support . it won t defend you from cruelty , it won t console you after something tragic happens unless you decide to go on a shopping spree , i guess , it won t make you feel less alone , it won t understand you , etc . it is just paper , plastic cards , coins , and numbers , at the end of the day .","244225":"i see , that sounds difficult to deal with . . . i hope your uncle will recover . i haven t had a close family member die before . my grandparents died , but i didn t know them very well . maybe it would help to remind yourself of the good memories you have of him ? smile because it happened , don t cry because it s over , that kind of thing . hm , at least some friends and family members are well , though , right ? now they deserve your attention most .","244226":"i really like this one .","244227":"i understand . that s why it s important to recognize cognitive distortions you can have positive thoughts . hm , damaged how ? i know from experience that people can have memory loss if their memories are too unpleasant to hold on to . it s important to have an outlet , though . maybe you could rant in a notebook somewhere private ? i know you will get through this . just don t let past bad experiences ruin future good ones .","244228":"some favorites are this includes visual novels and some games that can be found on both steam and actual consoles we happy few , missing children , the convenience

meds , i hope they help . maybe you should increase the dosage ? just remember , there are always people like you out there , who don t want to hurt anyone . and you will be alright . try to understand accept that your delusions do not reflect reality , otherwise you will become closed off to everyone . that will end up upsetting them . but i have hope in you ! you already recognize that there is a problem , which other people could not do . it takes a lot to want to change , and even more to work toward that change . you re on the right path !","244230":"read about cognitive distortions . recognize which ones you use , write the phrases down , and modify them so they are no longer distortions . example black and white way of thinking or exaggerations . everyone is out to get me . more realistic statement some people have betrayed me before , but they don t amount to everyone . not everyone has bad intentions toward me , and not everyone is conspiring against me . a few people doing that is not a reflection of everyone in the world . minimize your scope . if you re having hallucinations alongside these delusions , you may be schizophrenic , in which case you should take meds . either way , you should definitely see a therapist and maybe a psychiatrist as well .","244231":"i drew this .","244232":"i can t do much nowadays . in the past i spent hours writing very long messages to people in order to help them with suicidal thoughts and such , but because i typed so much , i ended up injuring my wrists . it s been three years and my parents have never taken me to get surgery for them , so i can t type as much anymore , and thus can t help people like i used to .","244233":"hm . . . i ll never be religious , haha . i think people tend to think in extremes they either believe in an afterlife or not . i do not believe in one , but i think reincarnation is a sort of middle ground there . i don t think people become other creatures , such as dogs or horses . rather , they start a new human life , in which they learn new lessons . these lessons are passed on with each life , until they reach their full individual potential wisdom . anyway , i am an atheist , but i agree with the buddhist philosophy . i don t practice it as a religion , but the philosophical teachings are nice . the buddhist concept of reincarnation differs from mine in that humans can become various animals , from what i understand . buddhism is commonly seen as a religion devoid of any diety , but there are in fact minor dieties in it . i don t believe in a diety , afterlife , or the concept of sins and such . those things are restrictive and assume that you are dependent and pathetic . like here s a moral code for you to abide by . no , i am purely an individual , with my own set of morals and path to growth and happiness . i don t care if people think i m going to burn in hell for being in a same sex relationship . it s an extremist concept to begin with .","244234":"i went to biltmore in november .","244235":"they wanted to cram the whole series into episodes , so they created a different ending for it . in the manga there is a scene on a bridge , rather than that roof , and it s more expanded . but essentially yashiro commits crimes because he likes to observe satoru s fighting spirit . he is used to people giving up , but satoru is an exception , and thus fills the hole in his heart . i don t remember the whole thing about the cancer patient very well , but it s probably a last attempt at getting satoru s attention . knowing yashiro can t live without him , satoru threatens to commit suicide . yashiro falls for it , and the police come to arrest him . in the manga at the park place , yashiro lures a girl to a building , but satoru predicts what he will do beforehand and teams up with kenya to get him . yashiro and satoru meet on a bridge , which yashiro sets on fire . satoru tackles him and they fall in the water beneath the bridge . yashiro ends up getting arrested because there is evidence of attemped murder with that girl .","244236":"eh , as long as my intentions are good , i don t think much of it . i have few moral standards , and they mostly relate to personal relations and social injustices . like , i believe in always being honest , and i m always loyal to friends . i hate things like homophobia and racism . but a friend of mine could be a serial killer and i wouldn t care . i have a strange moral compass . i would be friends with a cannibal but not a trump supporter , lol . i like anyone who is interesting , but i don t like liars , hateful people , those who are unloyal , etc . as for me , i don t do much that could be considered wrong , unless people have a problem with the porn i m into . but i don t break any laws .","244237":"bird feathers , stuffed animals , medicine bottles i want to make a tower out of them , origami cranes , calendars , books , stickers , gogo s

aquarium , perhaps with some additional siamese fighting fish . i like aquariums with little towers in them . i think something along the lines of spongebob s house and such a bikini bottom aquarium . it becomes too murky if you add too many plants , though the type of biome likely depends on the environment those particular fish would enjoy most . before i get an aquarium , i d like to have sea monkeys .","244239":"finding new music , creating things art , caring for someone and giving them all your love , pursuing your career , exploring the world , experiencing what nature has to offer ,

know research states that schizophrenics die early , but i assume that is due to factors such as having a higher chance of committing suicide or doing drugs . i ve never done any drug , and i m not feeling very suicidal , so .","244241":"correct me if i m wrong , but it seems to me that the timeframe is glitched . the tasks are supposed to be a week long , but it s cut short to six days . anyway , the key is to send about five shoutouts per day . as for completing the thread task , you can spam inactive users with questions . i mean users who haven t posted in like a year . don t pester active users , unless i guess they want you to . but it pisses me off when someone spams me with things that aren t questions emojis , for instance . with inactive users , you can just say hi again and again . wastes less time .","244242":"yeah , this is why i prefer to ask how are you feeling ? rather than how are you ? . it has the same meaning , but people are so used to saying fine or good to the second that attaching the word feeling probably catches them off guard . pleasantries are so annoying , i wish society would do away with them already . how are you ? good . no , you re not well , shut up . it s not even grammatically correct , either . well is a state of being , while good isn t . good refers to the quality of something . the movie i watched was very good . people are content with not only lying about how they feel but also being grammatically incorrect , essentially . and yes , maybe you truly are feeling well that day , which is why that sort of response is occasionally alright . and if you are on the asking end , don t get offended if the person tells you they don t feel well . they don t owe you a superficial answer . don t ask if you don t care .","244243":"i don t think veganism or vegetarianism are healthy . i remember reading about a certain substance that can only be found in real meat , not fake meat or supplements . my lifestyle of never going outside and thus having a vitamin d deficiency is , to me , unnatural . taking supplements shows that something about my life is unnatural . so , i think any diet that requires you to take supplements is not good . supplements mean you are missing something that could otherwise be achieved , if you had the right diet lifestyle whatever . i m aware that people don t always need supplements with these diets , but i would say a majority of them do . if you simply dislike meat , okay . but these people tend to have some savior complex . i m saving animals ! no , and eating meat is not animal abuse , because the animal is already dead , and you have no direct contact with it while it s alive unless you are a farmer , yourself . it s just like saying that using paper is killing trees news flash , the trees are dead , and paper is evidence of that . anyway , the whole moral elitist aspect of it is very off putting . but if they do not impose their diet on other people then i guess it s fine .","244244":"sure thing !","244245":"the thing about this is that if you say what you admire in people , then it s assumed you are not like that , yourself . as in , if i say i admire people who are , say , intuitive , then it s assumed that i am not intuitive , myself , and admire people for something i lack . but no , i admire people who , like me , are dedicated , always

on me and gave me heart shaped paper cutouts . i threw them away . in high school , i was cold to anyone that i knew had a crush on me . i would refuse to even say hello to them . i hate it when someone has feelings for me .","244248":"edit because i forgot something lol i m begging you to take the sakinorva test and not the personalities one i m assuming you took that one , like most people . personalities is utter garbage and gives the infj result out like candy . and if you take the sakinorva test and wonder about the results the grant result is your true type , the myers function type result is a type that s similar to yours from what i understand , and the myers briggs type isn t your actual type but is a type whose dominant function you really like basically . anyway , here are

completely","244249":"i think it can be both , or one of them . i ll use it in the scenario of relationships it depends on the nature stability of the relationship . for instance , a relationship that is full of control , gaslighting , jealousy , manipulation , etc . , is one of chaos , because it destabilizes both parties and is ultimately fragile and damaging . a relationship that is full of encouragement , reassurance , independence , acceptance , trust , etc . , is one of order , because it provides growth and stability . having order in life means feeling you are in control , and being disorganized means feeling out of control . a relationship in which both people or all , if it s a polygamous relationship , i guess support each other and are on the same page brings a sense of order , but if there is no support and the people in the relationship have different motives , it s disorganized . now , love is a culmination of various feelings , rather than an individual feeling . love can make people become jealous and controlling scenario of chaos relationship , or it can make people become nurturing and stable scenario of order relationship . thus it depends on the accompanying emotions . but i believe relationships can be bred from chaos and become healthy , or they can be bred from order but become chaotic . i believe that people are quick to leave a relationship if they consider it toxic , but not all toxic relationships stay toxic forever . because a toxic relationship means that someone , or both people , or all people , in that relationship is are unhealthy . they have the capacity to become healthy , if they so choose . but if they never do , the relationship stays toxic , or chaotic . love can drive some people mad and unstable . they want to know what their partner is doing at all times , they want to protect their partner from the perils of the world , and so on . but love can also make people happy , and provide a support system . love can make you gain confidence in yourself and learn to thrive . love can deplete all life , or it can bring life . this is because love has a dual nature . it is both birthing and murderous . an unhealthy person s love can be ruinous , while a healthy person s love can inspire improvement and maturation . but things are not always so rigid people are not always healthy or always unhealthy . this is how love can be ruinous at one point and inspire improvement maturation at another .","244250":"yeah , here s one of them .","244251":"carve and awkward by dance gavin dance , my girlfriend by lil xan but i love

on partner in life . that is , you can never be in more than one relationship throughout your lifetime . you can never have sex with more than one person , either . if you break up with your partner if they break up with you , you can never move on from them . if they die , you can never move on , either . they are your one and only , forever . this is how i am , at least . i have no ex . i will never have a future relationship , only the one i m in . but i am with my soulmate . i am forever hers . there is no such thing as fleeting love , in my opinion . there is love and there is infatuation . infatuation is temporary , but love is permanent . my love will last forever . if you can move on from someone , it means you never truly loved them . i know my idea of true devotion is idealistic . there are some factors that could impede it , after all what if someone dated a person when they were young and regretted the relationship does it even count at that age ? what if they believed they found their soulmate but realized this was not the case ? and well , i still believe your first relationship should be your last . you need the proper intuition insight to know who your soulmate is , too . your lover also cannot have a previous lover that would be evidence that their devotion is superficial . you both have to exclusively belong to each other . when i came to hold this belief . . . i think i was ? i developed feelings for my lover at the time , we were not together yet . i thought that even if she never loved me back , i would want only her forever . she did end up loving me back , but i maintained this view . yes , i will always think this way . and in case anyone asks , no , this is not about waiting until marriage . i do not believe in that stuff . you only have to wait until you meet your soulmate . also , i am not imposing my belief in true devotion on other people . i understand that everyone has their own definition of what it means to be devoted . this is mine , simply . it would be nice if other people felt the same way , but i know they would see this as unrealistic .","244265":"from what i have read , conspiracy theorists are more

secretive person online . that s why i ve gotten harassed i m too open . i ve done it many times , so it means little to me in the grand scheme of things . but after taking such a long break , it s nice to do it again .","244267":"i ll try to answer your three points on morality here . what you say about slavery is true , but the purpose of enslavement in nature is different . yes , a parasite can take control of its host , but it does that to survive . when we consider slavery among humans , slaves are used for labor . in nature , animals do what they must to survive their primary goals are to find food and reproduce . humans have more complex goals . do they share the same goals as other creatures , yes . but other creatures are not concerned with currency , for instance . certain creatures would die if they could not take control of a host . but people will not die without slavery , you know ? that is the difference . now , we can of course have the discussion of all humans being slaves , in a sense . slaves to the media , to the government , etc . but when i talk of slavery , i mean it in a literal sense that of forced labor . and yes , i agree that morality is instilled upon people at birth . but they are also capable of producing their own morals , independent of influence . my parents , for instance , are rather homophobic people and deem homosexuality immoral , but i am quite the opposite of that . i am in a same sex relationship . they also believe abortion is immoral , but i do not . and i could go on . you do not have to be majorly influenced by your parents , but many people are . when i mentioned humans being more intelligent than other creatures , i meant they have an expansion of perceptions , ideas , etc . they can invent a variety of things . they have greater necessities . they require more developmental attention think schooling . they have more responsibilities . they can run , jump , dance , do cartwheels , swim , and even fly . this is because they can make so many devices and how ? their knowledge and intellect . yes , some animals are notably intelligent , undoubtedly . and i would not say morality is intelligent . but i believe it prevents chaos . morality breeds laws . many laws are unreasonable , but others are of significance . human nature is not exactly benevolent , thus there would be crimes upon crimes . murder , torture , looting , etc . eh , i would not consider cloning or the use of stem cells to be immoral , personally . i m not the morality police , though .","244268":"hm . . . regarding letting my feelings out , yes . i have no real outlet other than writing . i m not the type to , say , punch a pillow when i m mad . i just keep it inside . that s why writing is so important for me . do i find writing to be the most relaxing thing , no . probably playing games watching videos , instead . when i first became truly aware of my emotions , i began writing . it has been crucial for me during times of contemplating suicide . the first time i contemplated it was when i was around , i remember . back then i wrote in journals , using them as a sort of diary .","244269":"i get quite annoyed when they victimize themselves . addiction is a disease uh , okay , but you chose to do drugs in the first place . if addiction runs in your family then it s even more reason to not touch drugs . people are fucking dumb , though . they like to blame mental illnesses but i m mentally ill and have never done drugs . it s just bad decision making on their part . i wouldn t say i hate them , but i do not feel bad for them , either .","244270":"hm , i haven t heard of it . but it s an antidepressant , so no wonder . i ve helped myself with my ocd , and suppressed my eating disorder when

wonder how you can become more comfortable with change . . . .","244271":"i do not have an interesting background . i am not very familiar with it , actually , because it serves no particular relevance to my life . i know i have some irish blood , as well as some native american blood , but these are somewhat distant things . you could not determine either of them from my appearance , i mean .","244272":"well , i m not in the mood to give a major analysis on anyone right now , but i ll try to give an analysis , nonetheless . you seem like the type of person to have intense and long lived obsessions . people can often be separated into obsession length groups . it indicates the use of si on your part . based on your use of si , i presume you are the sentimental type . you appreciate practicality and store many facts and bits of information . kind of like a walking encyclopedia , that type of person . you have strong opinions on things and make objective decisions . you have high standards in life . you value personal space and solitude . you are serious and responsible , and you honor promises . you have great concentration and are a reliable friend . you are cautious and appear calm during crises . you are very detail oriented , perhaps even stubborn . you can be perceived as cold by others , as well as neglectful , and must explicitly express your feelings , otherwise they will not understand . you attach special value to past experiences , and may recount the same story multiple times . you tend to be nostalgic and can recall things in vidid detail , despite how long ago they happened . you can relive past experiences not only for the sake of nostalgia but for fact checking purposes . you are always being reminded of things oh , that dog is similar to one i had in the past ! you may often have a confused yet resolute expression . there is a dull feeling about your eyes , because you are lost in thought much of the time , not placing a particular focus on your environment . your internal world is most immersive . you have a steady stare . it may seem as if you are often scowling . your head makes unusual movements when you speak your neck may jerk backward or forward . there is thus a certain sway to your body . but if i got the si part wrong , this whole thing could be wrong . . . anyway , it is an analysis based on an individual function . there are others to take into account .","244273":"yeah , you must ve used the unreliable personalities site . the whole t and a thing is nonexistent in actual mbti . that awful

claim i m an intj or istj , but i m an isfp , so .","244274":"hm , i d say both are at fault , to an extent . it s unrealistic to believe everyone will disappoint you . it s rather egocentric to assume everyone will betray you , everyone will lie to you , etc . there are many honest and loyal people out there , and it is unfair to group them in with everyone else . you become very close minded , assuming everyone is out to get you . and that you are important enough for them to want to betray you and such . i wouldn t say their expectations are high , unless the disappointment concerns something minuscule . they are just delusional , in the case of disappointment meaning betrayal . but yes , sometimes people s expectations are too high , and anyone who does not meet exceed those expectations is disappointing . other people are at fault for disappointing this person in the past , certainly . that is assuming the disappointment was realistic . it s hard to think of an example . . . but let s say you make a friend in class , and you ask them to give you the homework answers , then they refuse . that s a disappointment . you make another friend , and they , too , refuse to give you the homework answers . that s another disappointment . you adopt the belief that everyone will disappoint you and not give you the answers . in this case , you are expecting people to help you get away with not doing the homework . it isn t their fault for making you do the work , yourself . it s your fault for not doing it .","244275":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v wwo qv aqbq ab channel equalvisionrecords","244276":"i initially had a very literal style of writing . it was straightforward and not difficult to understand . however , as my hallucinations and delusions worsened , my manner of thinking became more metaphorical . i had to change my style of writing to match how i perceived the world . it was first made evident in the last chapters of a story i wrote . people enjoy that story because it is simple , but near the end i started using more metaphors . the book i m currently writing is highly metaphorical . the first chapters are less so , because i was still becoming accustomed to this new style . the metaphors and complex vocabulary perhaps seem out of place in comparison to more recent chapters . i find myself creating constant analogies to understand the world , and i want to project my vision on to my writing . as such , people complain that it s hard to understand , and expect me to dumb down the language for them . i ve created entire transcriptions of chapters to explain metaphors to people . i once read something , i am not sure where it was from a book ? , about how the average person , when approached with a word they cannot understand , look at it . they feel the need to look up the definition in the dictionary . they complain if they do not understand words . schizophrenics , however , look through words . they can interpret a word s meaning without having to look it up . my writing is largely reliant on the five senses . you should focus not on what something means but how it makes you feel . my intention is to make people feel things , to make them feel how i feel . i think this uncertainty over the meaning of my phrases creates a feeling of confusion in the reader . mental illnesses are a confusing thing . i suppose i m somewhat emulating the feeling of schizophrenia for my readers . that s how i see it , anyway . simple words , naturally , do not suit abstract thoughts . this is why i use obscure vocabulary words . i am also appealing to a large audience , in a sense , through both vocabulary and metaphors . i use vocabulary metaphors relating to many areas of life architecture , law , sociology , pottery , painting , economics , chemistry , biology , physics , math , weather , psychology , meteorology , medicine , religion , history , music , astrology , astronomy , topography , oceanography , zoology , cosmetology , photography , food , etc . i take terminology from many fields in order to create a very well rounded book . i am certain not many people are fond of the topics i write about my main interest is moral depravity , after all . but there is something in it for everyone , because i hope to appeal to a number of interests . people cannot conclusively say this isn t my type of book . because there is something for them to like about it , whether they recognize this or not . i am learning about many different things while simultaneously painting the images i want to paint .","244277":"hm . . . but isn t it boring living that way ? in the end , you realize how much time you wasted worrying about this and that , when you could have been enjoying your life . though i understand it isn t so simple , especially if you ve had this disorder for such a long time . you become so accustomed to it that you cannot release it , or imagine living without it .","244278":"i understand . at the same time , it s hardly something to live for , if it brings you pain suffering . there are more peace bringing reasons to live . i believe you mentioned having a lover , yes ? unless i misunderstood . but why not live for them , instead assuming you have a lover ? what are you passionate about ? and how often do you create goals unrelated to your disorders ?","244279":"yes , though at the same time , we cannot be reduced to primal creatures , unless perhaps we are uncivilized . i know people would consider my sense of morality to be skewed . i do not consider things like cannibalism , beastiality , incest , etc . , to be immoral or disturbing , and in that sense i fall within a minority . it takes a lot for me to see someone as evil . it s not a term i often use . people frequently rely on religion as a moral compass , but i do not care for it . i m not sure what exactly will be considered immoral by many in the future that is not already considered immoral . technology ? who knows .","244280":"i recall replying to a question like this in the past , but it was quite a while ago . i do not remember my answer , though . the thing is that morality shifts over time , but nature remains the same . in the past , people did not see slavery as a big deal , for instance . today we see it as something barbaric and cruel . it took an entire war to make slavery illegal . you would think people could agree on its immorality , but that was not the case . i do not believe nature can be deemed immoral . what is immoral is something manmade and harmful . a phone is manmade , but it is not harmful at least not in the slavery sense , therefore it is not immoral . slavery , on the other hand , was something men enforced . it is not commonly found in nature . and because it is harmful , it is immoral . i will use cannibalism as another example . cannibalism is found in nature , unlike slavery . certain praying mantis species cannibalize their mates . mother hamsters sometimes eat their young . so is cannibalism immoral , no . it is harmful , but because it is natural , it is not immoral . immorality is something people assign to actions , because individuals have a conscience and are capable of complex thoughts . other creatures can think , as well , but they are of lesser intelligence . i do not think everything harmful is immoral , unlike other people . my criteria is thus is this thing manmade ? yes is it harmful ? no it is not immoral is this thing manmade ? yes is it harmful ? yes it is immoral is this thing manmade ? no morality cannot be ascribed to it i think it s a fair system , at least .","244281":"yeah , it sucked because i was promised to be taken to a hospital where they d give me intensive therapy for like two weeks and finally let me share my situation with someone . that did not happen , however , because all the beds in that hospital were full . the hospital i went to has a mediocre rating , and a therapist ? i saw there was not understanding of how i felt whatsoever . i think going there was a waste of time , really . three weeks sounds like a long time . do you see a therapist ? i assume you see a psychiatrist , since you mentioned meds . or maybe therapists prescribe meds where you live , i m not sure . luckily i ve only been to the hospital one time . it was over two years ago , but it feels like only a few months ago . i genuinely cannot remember much of .","244282":"it was in late , probably around october or so . i was sensitive to light and sound for quite some time afterward . i remember bringing earplugs to school because the lunchroom was so loud . you never realize how bright the lights at school are until you get a concussion . i did not take any time off . i tried going without the internet for a while , to recover , but it made me feel too depressed . shortly after i got the concussion and still had it , i was at my locker when a boy slammed his locker door against my head . it was an accident , but it naturally made my head feel even worse . i thought i might ve had a brain bleed at that point , so i went to the hospital i m pretty sure this was days later , because my parents did not care , but it was alright . for a concussion to go away , you have to avoid sources of stimulation , but i could not avoid them . i had never experienced a headache before i got this concussion . i ve had headaches ever since i got it . these headaches used to be rather constant . i m no longer sensitive to light sound , but my head starts hurting if i listen to certain music . after i got the concussion , i started seeing these floating black dots , kind of like what you see if you rub your eyes for too long or look at the sun for too long ? . i did not think too much of the dots . but eventually i started seeing hallucinations . this makes me wonder if maybe my hallucinations were caused by the concussion . or maybe it s just a coincidence . yes , thank you for making it less confusing now .","244283":"i suppose a mixture of both . but if i am to get any recognition , i d rather it be the good kind of recognition . i do not imagine my writing will amass a large audience . it appeals to a very niche group of people , and i have no interest in changing the subjects i write about in order to attract more fans . i write as self expression . all of my characters are based off of me , in one way or another . some of their emotions are also very much my own . this is my one outlet for unpleasant feelings , i d say . or pleasant ones , for that matter . other ambitions , well . . . i want to be a multi skilled person . i have many interests , and i might as well make use of them . my plan is to have several jobs psychologist main , author , photographer , translator , and taxidermist . plus even more . i plan to get a ton of money so i can travel and enjoy life to the fullest .","244284":"i liked the movie adaptation of it . i believe this author deserves more recognition , and it is strange that his works are so obscure despite all the scandals surrounding him . he was an interesting man , and i want to do his books justice by translating them . i plan to finish translating this book and then move on to a more personal book of his . yes , i think people should find more words , because the average ones are not specific enough . the word for love and cupid are the same in french , so i accidentally kept translating something as love rather than cupid .","244285":"yeah , some people are like that , they just want to be polite . i wish they d show a genuine interest . it s annoying to share writing with friends , too , because they re often like send the next chapters , without expressing what they like about the story . of course , i d rather people say nothing than say something critical . but it s always the same non constructive criticism , so i m kind of used to it .","244286":"it s nothing , really . i m used to talking about this sort of thing . yes , but at least i got on medicine relatively early compared to other people . it seems like depression and eating disorders run in my family , but oddly no one has hallucinations like me , or ocd , or manic episodes . i know they say mental illnesses are hereditary , but in my case they hardly are","244287":"i prefer to write spontaneously . i think it creates more suspense unpredictable scenes . because if i can predict what will happen next through planning , the reader probably can , too ! that s my weird logic , anyway . it probably depends on what type of stuff you write about , too . you should probably study how people interact irl and learn to read facial expressions and body language to get these things across in your writing . my main issue with people s stories is that the dialogue is so incredibly unrealistic . think , would anyone actually say this ? consider how realistic the characters themselves are , too . they are bound to be more realistic if they re based off of you people you personally know .","244288":"hm . . . well , i see no reason to learn how to drive before i m in college . i ll forget how to . i m scared of driving because of hallucinations , too . i was once in the car not driving , obviously and i hallucinated a man standing in the middle of the road . imagine if i were driving and stopped the car , then everyone crashed into me . so i m scared . about getting a job , most of them require you to stand walk around . my back hurts if i stand or walk for too long , though . i d be happy with some office job , but they do not really offer those to someone who is young , from what i understand . they would rather i work in retail or food service , but my back wouldn t allow that . so i m kind of stuck .","244289":"wow , that s a long time . i haven t had issues with it for nearly as long as you . i d say my body image issues started around , but i didn t get an eating disorder until . i ve mostly curbed it by now . i have come to realize that eating disorders are driven by ocd obsessive thoughts about food , calories , and your body , and compulsions regarding weighing yourself , only eating a certain amount , exercising , etc . , and thus if you focus on your ocd itself , it s easier to help the eating disorder . i noticed that my eating disorder came around the time when my ocd sprang up , so there must be a correlation , keeping these symptoms in mind . i wonder if ocd meds help ?","244290":"getting accepted into a university , improving at

introverted , extroverted if your dominant function is an extroverted one , it means your cognitive focus is on the environment external relations . it does not mean you are socially an extrovert . similarly , if your dominant function is an introverted one , it means your cognitive focus is on the internal you are more introspective brooding . it does not mean you are socially an introvert . for an example , se stands for extroverted sensing , and si stands for introverted sensing . my functions are fi se ni te . notice how there are not two introverted or extroverted functions beside one another it s impossible . because my dominant function is fi , i care about personal values over everything else . te is my weakest function . infj functions are ni fe ti se . i would say ti and se are functions that are more enjoy the moment . si focuses on the past , and ni , ne ? , and te focus on the future . thus if your dominant function is ni , you have a very particular focus in life , you are future oriented , and you are metaphorical . someone who has ni in general is metaphorical , but not as much as someone with dominant ni , unless they are mentally ill because some mental illnesses cause you to think more metaphorically . i hope this isn t too complicated ! i m not too well versed in mbti , so i have a hard time explaining it . i just think it s nice to get into . but if you d rather not , that s okay , mbti isn t for everyone . it s more convoluted than enneagram . the functions are overwhelming .","244292":"est . if you mean my government teacher , she seems very laid back . she has a tendency to expose herself to opinions she already agrees with , rather than venturing out , but she tries her best . whatever her political affiliation is , she is the type to feel strongly about what she believes in . perhaps she is only laid back in videos , however . she seems kind of . . . vengeful , maybe ? there is something beneath the surface .","244293":"when i say something along those lines , i mean that i can predict when someone will disappoint me . i often give them the opportunity to prove me wrong , but they disappoint me , as i thought they would . not everyone is disappointing in life , but many people , yes . i think it should be changed to most people disappoint me , or even some people disappoint me , to sound like less of a cognitive distortion . but we are considering everyone out of a given group those who seem as if they will disappoint in the future , not those who seem promising . in reference to other people , though , well . . . it is a cognitive distortion , in the end . unless you have a great instinct , it s an unreliable statement . i hate it when someone says they cannot trust anybody . that is a major distortion , no matter who you are . it would be more realistic to say i ve had a hard time reading people correctly .","244294":"i see , i don t think i ve heard that reason before , so thank you . i would say i have changed in some areas , but perhaps not others . i went from experiencing little to no empathy to experiencing an excess of empathy . neither of these extremes are good . i remember how , at the height of the blm movement , i wanted to write poems for every individual impacted by police brutality . but it s impossible for one person to write so many poems , you know ? i wrote rant after rant on the injustice of police brutality , and cried again and again . and it was like . . . damn , what is happening to me ? i try to stabilize my empathy , but i m someone who s prone to extremes in life , so it s hard . oh , this empathy is overwhelming me . it d be better to go back to having none . that kind of thing . hm , i attribute this transformation of empathy to my lover . the issue with society , i have realized , is this someone acts out , or intends to act out , and rather than empathizing with that person and trying to help them out of that state , people condemn them , harass them , and so forth . people are quick to title someone a sociopath and such , too . but i believe the majority of sociopaths are people who did not receive adequate empathy care throughout life , and thus do not know how to empathize with or care for others . was i ever a sociopath , no , i was an unhealthy schizophrenic with low empathy . but i can apply my former situation to that of others . i use this analogy quite often if you have never eaten a strawberry before , how can you be expected to explain the flavor of it to someone else ? this is how empathy works , in my opinion . i found myself empathizing with my lover this is before we got together , because she empathized with me first . i lacked this empathy from other people . for a while she was the only person i could empathize with , but she helped me to share my empathy with other people . i would say i lost my empathy in late early , and gained it back , somewhat , in late . it did not develop properly until around mid . but i still clung to this image of being a very sadistic person and such , perhaps as a defense mechanism . i thought no one would bother me if they were intimidated by me . but people fear what they do not understand , and fear leads to hostility . i would not have been so attacked if it weren t for how i portrayed myself . my portrayal was never deceptive , i think i just neglected to update my image , so to speak . i went from watching a video of kittens being murdered and enjoying it to crying over injured kittens . leaving behind traumatic memories , and traumatic places , helped me to grow and become more peaceful . it was a combination of wanting to create a new life for myself and having my lover assist me along the way . i know some people have crude things to say about her , because they do not know her well enough , but i genuinely mean it when i say i wouldn t be here today without her .","244295":"hm , but isn t it kind of counterproductive ? without my eating disorder , i would die . but eating disorders kill people . it is something to emotionally cling to , understandably . i have a hard time letting go of my tendencies , as well . i am probably too dependent in love . the thought of a breakup scares me , because i know it would absolutely shatter me . i m lucky it s never happened to me . in the past my main driving force was my career goal . i do still value it , but it isn t all i have .","244296":"i do not separate people between good and evil in the sense others often think . and i m an atheist , so there s no such thing as sin in my book . for me it is more about who has good and bad intentions . if you are a good person , it means you have good intentions . you can do bad things without necessarily being a bad person . thank you for reading my answers .","244297":"thank you , i appreciate it . and you taking the time to get to know me . not many people do that . it was only one time , for a few days in october of . i was missing school from being in the hospital , so i had to be taken home . it was an unpleasant experience being at the hospital . you were not allowed to cry there for more than like five minutes . i saw a girl beat another girl s head against the floor . the shower was very dark , and there was little privacy . my roommate kept staring at me all the time . i made a few friends there , but i had no way to keep in touch with them . the food was great , so i can t complain about that . i did not feel safe , though .","244298":"thank you ! i was very dedicated to entertaining myself . i was not writing with the intent of publication back then . my current works , however , i wish to publish , so i actually put more effort into them . i consider myself to be very ambitious , and once i have a goal , i do not back down from it . that included writing something with over , chapters . now i just want to finish the book i m writing , haha . i m not really sure . back then i wanted to publish a book at a young age , for instance . i found it impressive that children could write and publish books . but the circumstances did not allow for it . i have come to understand that books written when you are very young tend to not be very good . it s important to have significant experience before publishing . by now i have an abundance of experience . i ve been writing for years and years , and my style has changed for the better in my opinion . i wanted to have something to show for , i guess ? i haven t achieved many things in life , at least from my perspective . i ve never won a contest or anything like that , i mean . i do not have a university degree to represent academic achievement . i do have , however , a high gpa , and my essays have been lauded throughout the years . my writing has been compared to that of shakespeare and edgar allan poe , by teachers , classmates , friends , parents , and so on . i think it is very different , but i can see the parallels . poe s works were very morose , like mine . shakespeare wrote in a rhythmical way , as i do and his style is not easily understood . it s funny to look back on my old writing , because it s just so bad . that s to be expected , though , when you re like . i had this belief that i was a very strange and misunderstood person , despite the fact that there was , at the time , nothing to indicate such . i wrote about demons who were ostracized from society . it was kind of prophetic , because now i actually have reason to feel that way . the writing is kind of cute in how overly dramatic yet simplistic it was .","244299":"i agree . i m not fluent in french , so i rely on french dictionaries and such to find the meaning of words . i use google translate when i am unsure of the formatting , but it isn t reliable when it comes to specific words , because a single word can have multiple meanings . i once tried to translate a phrase through google and it said he shot his cannon , but the true meaning was he blew his nose . there are expressions you have to pick up on . i used to translate on sticky notes and then type up the translations , but the book is too thick from the sticky notes and will probably fall apart if i add more , so i moved to just translating on the document . the document itself is over pages long now .","244300":"it depends on the day . sometimes i like my appearance , and other times i do not . i would say i have a nice nose . i like my eyebags , too . i know that s a strange thing to like about yourself , and most people want to hide their eyebags , but i embrace them . it s mostly my legs and hips that i dislike . i also have acne . if i go in front of a mirror , it s often to ensure that i do not have any rheum . i try not to look at myself too often , because i d rather not . i even covered the mirror in my room with drawings because i do not want to see myself . i either feel self loathing or i am happy with myself . sometimes i feel that people would rather i not be in this world , but other times i feel that i make important contributions . i think i have the capacity to feel a deep appreciation for things , and i often do feel a deep appreciation . i m a very passionate person , and i m worthwhile . hm , i m hard to be friends with in the sense that i have a hard time maintaining consistent contact with people . it s easy for me to open up to someone , so they can certainly be my friend , but i have this compulsion to not reply to people . it s nothing personal . so i rarely talk to my friends . i m loyal to them , though . that s the good part about being my friend i ll never betray you . and i do not enjoy conflict , so i will not start fights , either . you just won t hear from me much , unless you re in a discord server with me . but i m hesitant to join any servers , so . don t apologize for your questions ! i like them , and thank you for showing an interest in me .","244301":"i rarely ever go outside . the last time was actually not too long ago , though . it was on the th of november . but it probably doesn t count much , because we just went to a restaurant , lol . i didn t spend time outdoors . i went outside days before that to go skating , which i hadn t done in probably two months . i would say i go outside maybe once a month , just to be driven somewhere my mom might drag me shopping . sometimes once every like three months . over the summer but not this latest summer because of corona i go to the amusement park basically every week . we go on vacation to south carolina and go to the beach there . other than going outside during the summer , i only really went outside to go to the bus stop to get to school , wait for my bus to take me home , etc . i stay home more now that i m not in school . i go out to eat every now and then . hm , maybe . i am afraid of leaving my house in the sense of not actually going somewhere . i can t go for a walk , as an example . i get paranoid about cars passing by . i can go if i m not alone , but i still find it unpleasant . public places usually make me hallucinate , too .","244302":"i m still not very good at it , haha . i was doing it wrong this whole time , in fact ! i rarely skate because my mom has to help me , but she is usually in some kind of pain or too busy . i follow about people , and i have , followers . i follow these people for any or all of the following reasons they asked me to follow them in exchange for following me i do not always comply it depends on their content , they ask good questions , or they give good answers .","244303":"i think it was a gift for my lover . i had a ruined roll of film it did not develop properly , but rather than throwing it away , i sewed drawings to it . i do not write very often . i try to , but i get distracted . i end up writing like two sentences per week . then i have random days where i suddenly am not distracted at all , and i write several paragraphs , or even several pages . it takes longer to write than it used to , because i have to find the perfect words for what i want to express . there are only so many dictionaries online , and most of them do not have the words i want .","244304":"i ve accidentally made like three accounts on this site , but i remember officially using it in i think late . well , i enjoy answering questions , and sometimes asking them . some people on here are mean , like anywhere else , but there are some great users , too . i wish they had an ip banning system , and that they d tell you what you got a ban warning for . they should have phishing scam as a report option , as well as the option to report inappropriate profile images . they should censor certain words to combat harassment , but be more lenient on certain rules . for example , i once got a ban warning for i think using a picture of an anime style character smoking , lol . they never said what i got the warning for , but they have some strict rules on this site regarding the wrong things .","244305":"sure . my hallucinations primarily revolve around bugs , because i have a major fear of them though i should mention it s improving with time ! . i hallucinate moths and other insects . when i wasn t on medicine , i hallucinated maggots everywhere . i d pour a bowl of cereal and see maggots writhing inside of it . i even saw maggots in a random tiny body of water . i ve never actually seen a maggot in person before , which is ironic . but we had a moth infestation in the past . the moths originated from some expired food . i believe the moths grew from little worms , or maybe the worms were separate . but you d see these worms crawling on the ceiling , and if you were unlucky , you d see them in a box of cereal , too . this is where the fear of maggots must have started , though those worms were not maggots because if i m not mistaken , maggots are fly larvae , not moth larvae . i hallucinated walls shifting and closing in on me . for a while i saw random objects falling a yellow ? pillow fell from the ceiling of my room , and as i was showering i felt a bar of soap fall beneath me , too . of course , there was not actually a pillow there , nor a bar of soap . the thing about these hallucinations is that they could be plausible . it s not strange to see a pillow in your own bedroom , or for soap to fall in the shower . but they just weren t real phenomena . while waiting at the bus stop one time , i hallucinated an entire bus rounding a corner . i pointed to it and told my brother it was there , and he said there was no bus . these hallucinations look very real , and it s hard to determine whether they are real or not . i have a sort of mistrust toward my perceptions now . i hallucinate a certain smell and taste at times . i can t really describe it . imagine smelling dust , and tasting it . that s kind of the similarity . i once hallucinated a fork hanging from a classroom ceiling . i have a foggy memory of this next thing , but i ll recount it as i remember it a few months back , when i was still physically in school and keep in mind i was on meds , i went to the bathroom . i saw that a stall door was closed , and someone was in it , based on their feet from under the door . i went in the stall beside that one , as such . when i came out , i saw that the other stall door was in fact open , and there was no one in there . it wasn t that someone had been in the stall and they left the bathroom . no one had ever been in there . i was alone the whole time . and it was no surprise , given that i was staying after school that day , and most people had left already . i also hallucinated some people sitting on a bench while i was on the bus . every now and then i hallucinate a corpse either inside or outside of my house . as for auditory hallucinations , they are mostly male voices screaming at me and telling me to die . sometimes they weep . i usually hear multiple voices at once .","244306":"a combination of both . i have some child like interests , and i enjoy things from my childhood in general . my brain is comparable to that of someone who is older than my actual age , since my early puberty increased my stage of development . despite writing about mature subjects and having some notably mature interests on top of the more childish ones , i sometimes struggle to feel older , because i do not have much independence yet . i m not quite in university yet , for instance . no driver s license or permit , no job , can t cook . . . . online people mistake me for someone older , but i would say i look younger than i am , or maybe i look my age .","244307":"yep , i m that type of person . i m very accustomed to solitude . from the age of around and onward , i started to isolate myself . our house , at that time , had a third floor , with only a single room this room featured the computer . i stayed in there all the time , away from everyone else . i rarely experience loneliness , and i have fun on my own . i do not require friends to feel happy . i would say i m less content with never seeing someone again than i used to be , because i couldn t imagine never talking to my lover . i need her in my life . as for everyone else , i do not really need their company though i do appreciate the company of some people , of course . i m not someone who craves physical contact or anything , either .","244308":"hm . . . when i say pure , i am not talking about morals , more so decisions , interests , and the like . i do not believe in the concept of sin , which i know dictates , for most people , what makes something pure or impure . for me it s more someone or something minding its business and doing as it pleases without really bothering anyone . take a heron , for instance . i think they are very underrated , and i consider them to be pure . they go unnoticed , and you do not particularly think of them as harmful . i think they have a special sort of beauty , given their unimposing nature . i would say certain animals are pure , and young children . some adults , as well . it s harder for adults to be pure because they have knowledge of harsh things which they may resort to , and they are more imposing . people also become less idealistic hopeful over time . i would say idealism and a sense of hopefulness signify purity . for instance , if terrible things have happened to you , but you are hopeful you must also be harmless . being harmless , being idealistic , being hopeful , being carefree , having childish interests . . . i d say those things are pure . someone would probably make the argument that nothing is impure , then , because everyone is harmful in the sense that they kill for food and such . but i more so mean having malicious intent . if you blackmail people , doxx them , etc . , you are not pure . those things represent ill intent . anyway , i do not think purity is a single thing , it encompasses several different traits . an idea or non living thing can be pure , as well . a rainbow , for instance . because it brings happiness while not hurting anyone .","244309":"my day has been alright . i ve done some physics assignments , and i watched a government lecture video . i need to read part of a play for english and answer questions on that , as well . other than assignments , i ve been answering questions on here , haha . i m kind of worried about my wrists , though , because they start to hurt if i type too much . i look forward to writing soon , when i have the time . i m worried about my teacher not responding back to me .","244310":"i think most films are boring and a waste of time . my attention span is rather short , so i do not find myself watching movies very often . that should be evident with how i get distracted while writing . the last thing i watched was midsommar . before that it was juno . i m not quite sure of what i would like to watch next . i will watch whatever my lover wants to watch together . i decided to watch juno after hearing about elliot page s trans identity , so spontaneous things like that will make me watch something , too .","244311":"yeah , i can t stand people who go on about how they re so morally correct and good , but then they go around harassing people and being bitchy . if you are a good person then you wouldn t feel the need to mention it every two seconds . i consider myself to be a good judge of character , yes . i sometimes befriend people whom i know will disappoint me betray me in the end . why ? i have no clue . i think i want to assume the best in people , and for them to pleasantly surprise me , but unfortunately things always turn out as i think they will . i should trust my intuition more , certainly . i can read someone with minimal information , just a little description of who they are . it s happened before that someone has given me a sentence about someone and i ve done a complete analysis of them .","244312":"i was a very unstable and delusional person , because the schizophrenic aspect of my disorder was very prominent . i was not on medicine back then . i believed zombies were real , that maggots were colonizing my body , that there was a man living in a wall in my closet , etc . i had very irrational beliefs , but i did not impose them on anyone . i care about not being perceived as someone who is illogical . i came off as very logical and composed , and helped people with their psychological issues while sort of stifling my own . one of the symptoms of schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder is having a lack of empathy . i could not empathize with humans , nor living creatures in general . i watched the most extreme porn i could find violent , depraved . nothing was hardcore enough for me . i began to want to commit a crime , and confessed to this . the most infamous crime , i decided . one that everyone would remember . i gained this reputation of being twisted , scary , even a potential threat . others suspected i was trolling or just trying to be edgy , but that was never the case , i was just genuinely very mentally ill and homicidal . i was adamant on committing a crime to prove those who doubted my ability to do so wrong . but you know , i think i ve grown a lot since then . now i have too much empathy , and cry over the slightest things . i m still a sadist , but not as much of a sadist as i once was . i no longer want to commit a crime . back then i just had no reason to live . it was either commit a crime and go to jail or commit suicide . i saw those as my only choices . i have a reason to live now , though . i think i have a lot more to offer than having strange fetishes . i am haunted by this version of myself because it s the version people still make me out to be . oh , this is yaoi , she s a very mentally ill fetishist who plans to commit a crime . and i admit i still somewhat cling to this part of myself , too , because i ve convinced myself it s what makes me interesting . or they will completely lie about me , and suggest i ve already committed crimes . people refuse to get to know the present me , and to acknowledge my development . i ve moved on in life , but it seems like they never will .","244313":"hm , they re pretty manageable . it used to be difficult because i d go to school for hours and then go home and study for hours . there was no time for hobbies . now , however , i only have three classes , and while they consume a decent portion of my day , i do not spend hours studying anymore . too lazy , i guess . as long as i get good grades , i do not mind . i sleep roughly hours a day . i hardly have a support system . my parents support me , to a degree , but i am not on good terms with other family members they believe false rumors about me , like most people seem to . . . or i ve given them the real story but they choose to misunderstand me . my younger brother is nice to me . my mother is the type who rants to strangers . she s very dramatic and emotional . she obsesses over certain people for a long time she knows everything there is to know about michael jackson and prince , lol . my father is the stoic type . he reads many books , and he rarely ever cries in front of anyone . but he s impatient and has a short temper . he s an alcoholic and a smoker . he does not seem to care about his health , or the health of others . he lies a lot and denies both smoking and drinking . he s a fairly dangerous person . yes , i have eight siblings , but i only live with my younger brother and our parents .","244314":"hm , i think when it comes to things i enjoy . i do not mean that in the sense that i have few hobbies things i enjoy , though . i consider most writing to be horrendous , for example . i like to read , but people write such painfully repetitive and boring things . i m picky with how people phrase things . i m picky with friends , finding most people boring , just like most literature , movies , etc . i m not a picky eater . i m picky about what i like and dislike , in various realms of life . but i can also see beauty in practically everything . i m proud of my writing skills , my intuition , my honesty , my dedication , the fact that i m a good friend , my morality , my self growth , my knowledge , my open mind . i m ashamed of my past , and how passive i can be . i would say i m ashamed of how i used to self harm , but i never left any marks on myself , so there is no visible shame i sought the most painless form of harm , which no one can see . i m ashamed of some things i said in the past . i m ashamed of giving some people the benefit of the doubt and assuming the best in them . yeah , i m not very nice to myself . i call myself an idiot and such without noticing . i have negative thoughts about my body , and experience a lot of guilt for things , even things that are not my fault . i m quick to blame myself , and to hate myself . i quickly spiral over anything that is remotely upsetting . well , i used to harbor hatred for the world . i hated how people treated me . but it s too overwhelming to hate the world , so the anger turned inward , and i hated myself instead . i m not as self loathing as i used to be , though .","244315":"my ocd is mostly compulsions rather than obsessive thoughts , but lately i ve been having more of those thoughts . it became full blown during , when i developed the compulsion to watch anime episodes per day . i became very anxious if i watched less than . i refused to go to a friend s house during that time , because it would interrupt my schedule . i turned down other things , such as going to the pool , too . this compulsion took over my life . i completed anime after anime , but not joyously . i would say it was a way of taking control in life . at the time i did not have my own computer , so i was on the downstairs computer all the time . as i ve said before , my parents are always fighting , so i was exposed to their fights downstairs each day . there have also been many bug infestations in my house mostly moths , fruit flies , and carpet beetles . one time we had fleas , because one of my sisters worked at the zoo and likely brought them home . i needed to compensate for my environment , to somehow keep myself stable . it took until late or early , i believe , for this compulsion to go away . while my compulsions once contributed to cleanliness , i now have compulsions related to messes . the compulsion to not put up my clothes , for instance . i developed obsessive thoughts about diseases . if i merely see blood , and don t even touch it or anything , i panic , thinking i have contracted hiv . i know it sounds irrational to people , but that s how ocd works . or if someone accidentally spits on me because you know , people sometimes spit when they talk , i start thinking i have hepatitis . i have obsessive thoughts about walking on the street . i think someone will stab me with a diseased needle . i have some small but annoying compulsions . when i was physically in school , i repeatedly checked my backpack throughout the day , in fear of my phone falling out . a bracelet i wear often fell off , so i had to keep checking for that , too .","244316":"no problem ! i like sharing . yeah , it s kind of a contradiction because i d consider myself to be a fairly spontaneous and unplanned person , yet i also abide by a rather strict schedule . it s not as bad as it used to be , though . translating time is at pm , for instance , but sometimes i m forced to translate later on . at least my ocd prevents me from procrastinating .","244317":"i m not anti meds , i m anti substances . if that makes sense . i do not support the use of cocaine , vapes , alcohol , etc . i ve never done any substances , personally . not interested in weed and other harmless drugs , either . i m also anti med abuse , of course . i do not support the misuse of painkillers and addictive meds . i have no problem with the reasonable use of meds . i mean , they re necessary for my conditions . i do not take meds for my ocd , because the primary meds for it are ssris . i consider ssris to be terrible , because their side effects are usually not worth any help they provide . some conditions i believe you can treat without meds depression , for instance . i take meds for both hallucinations delusions and extreme moods , because they cannot really be treated without them . i tried to treat them on my own , of course . but there is no self cure for hallucinations , you know . i m not sure how well the mood meds help , but i haven t been to a mental hospital since , so i d like to think they work . i went from having constant auditory and visual hallucinations , as well as unremitting derealization and the occasional depersonalization to having auditory hallucinations only when distressed or in public places , if i do not listen to music . . . music seems to help a lot , and a visual hallucination maybe once every two weeks or so . i no longer feel derealized or depersonalized . i still get catatonic episodes , though , and sometimes psychotic episodes but again , only when distressed . also , i m not sure why people always seem to suggest i need professional help . i ve been seeing a psychiatrist since , and a therapist since . i saw a different therapist in , but he did not take me seriously enough , despite the fact that i had major issues . he was ageist or something . anyway , i already have professional help . people assume stupid things , even though i talk about taking meds again and again .","244318":"well , i wrote it when i was around . each chapter was not very long , essentially a big paragraph of text . i did not care about traditional formatting , so i never used quotation marks until the very end . it ended up being a mess , as such . i did not even separate dialogue into its own lines . i was writing it solely for my enjoyment . no one else was reading it . and i m rather glad they did not , because it was an embarrassment . i never actually finished it . it was an ongoing story with various parts . the first story in the series , the prequel , was roughly chapters long . the next story was around , chapters long , but i do not remember finishing it ? or maybe i started a third story in the series . anyway . at first i suggested , but when i went back and checked , it was over . i lost a good of that story . the writing website i used was taken down without any prior warning . i salvaged a more recent story . i requested a file copy of what they had archived from my account . it s a massive file , but there are only bits and pieces of random chapters here and there . so i might have chapters , , , , etc . nothing complete . it s evidence that it happened , but it s all i have left . i also have various notebooks i wrote parts of chapters in . i had over , chapters of content on that account , from starting various other stories along the way . i had a little rhyming book , and a book of rants . i took a break from the , chapter long story , which ended up being permanent . i m kind of glad i never continued it , because even more chapters would have been lost . it took me about a month to start writing again , after this major loss . i could have stopped entirely , but i didn t .","244319":"mostly little animals , such as squirrels and birds . it would be nice to preserve their beauty . i actually wrote a little thing on being enamored , for a college application . it goes as follows i find that people often have the same favorite word something simple like love or hope . mine is enamored . i consider myself to be quite romantic i ve written roughly love poems . at one point i even collected roses . roses dwindle in beauty and die , unlike love , which i perceive to be a permanent emotion . i do not believe in second or third relationships , nor do i believe you can fall out of love with someone . perhaps i would be considered an idealist , in this respect . individuals often harbor such superficial emotions . if love is able to die , it means it was never true love to begin with . i am forever enamored , both by my significant other and the world itself . i am able to see beauty in everything , and my love is peaceful and sincere . i admire from afar and love in close proximity . i prioritize my lover above all else . knowing my love is reciprocated , and that i alone am not enamored , brings me serenity and prosperity . i enjoy the taste of certain foods , but not when i am upset . then it becomes a struggle even to chew , and i spit the food up . that probably sounds gross , lol , but it s true . i simultaneously have a bad relationship with food , because of my eating disorder tendencies . my physical health is not very good . my body tends to hurt . i ve had back pain for years . i figure it s because of the vitamin d deficiency . that s the root of my physical problems , i ve determined . i started puberty early , and ironically have growing pains to this day . it s like my body wants to continue growing but it cannot .","244320":"trigger warning for anyone reading when i was , i began starving myself . i counted calories all the time and weighed myself again and again . i exercised frantically . when my mom found out about my problem , she threatened to take me to the hospital and force me to have a feeding tube . . . she did not bother to try to understand me . my parents have this attitude in general , of not wanting to deal with anything and not wanting to give support . anyway , i ended up weighing less than i did in th grade . but because i knew no one would actually help me get better , i helped myself . gained the weight back , but still skipped meals sometimes . i have this tendency to want to do it all over again . i hate eating in front of people . i almost always feel fat , even though i m objectively not . i can t even get a snack without feeling guilty and hating how i look .","244321":"i fell off my scooter this was when i was like , and i broke my ankle and part of my leg . my growth plate closed . i needed surgery for the other one to be closed , too , and to insert some screws ? to protect the injured ankle . this meant that my feet could not grow bigger but i could still grow taller . if the other one was not closed , i would have grown on only one leg . my feet were already a size adult , so it was fine . even years after the surgery , my ankles are fragile . i cannot run or jump much . i still have scars from it , too .","244322":"i compare it to their fears and statements about things . i know people who do not fear needles and sharp objects , for example . girls tend to have some or all of the following fetishes being slapped , having their hair pulled , knifeplay gunplay , and being choked . i have no such interests . i am a sadist , not masochistic in the slightest . i would say the prevalence of these fetishes shows that other people tend to have a higher pain tolerance than me . even just getting pinched is too much . but i would gladly hurt someone to their heart s content .","244323":"i have a friend who is pretty much exactly like me , but i would say she does not use her intuition in the same way and has trouble reading people s intentions toward her . we get along very well . i ve never had a conflict with her not that i ve had them with other friends , really . i tend to disagree with people on things , but she and i share the same views .","244324":"no problem . yeah , that s alright . the last thing that made me cry was probably one of my teachers using capslock . i know it sounds dumb . but she sounded very passive aggressive and angry at me . i got a on an essay in english which i consider impressive for an ap lit class , given the essays i ve read from other people , and the grades they got , so i guess those things cancel each other out . it s still sad , though . and sorry , i can t talk about my age because of unpleasant memories associated with it . i m old enough to vote , so there s that .","244325":"hm . . . but would you describe yourself as a very metaphorical person ? infjs have a dominant ni function . ni is future oriented , focuses on a single task not scattered , relies on metaphors for communication . it is a convergent function . they have an inferior se function , meaning they struggle with living in the present . infjs also have fe rather than fi . this means pleasantries and small talk do not bother them . they are inclusive when it comes to groups , and do not particularly want to stand out . they value social norms . infjs have ti , which is a subjective judgment function . this means that they consider self truths rather than the objective truth . a type with a ti preference is often more biased than someone with te si is also a relatively biased function , but if we consider the eight function model , it s the infj s weakest function . . . ni is more objective , and because it is so prominent for infjs , they tend to be pretty realistic . when it comes to goals , they care more about the process than actually reaching the end result . because they have a strong fi function since fi is their sixth function , which is even more prominent than the fifth , oddly , they can seem to be less of a fe user . they are more well rounded than some other types . while they have a preference for abiding by social norms , they can at times go against this . just because someone has a preference for fe does not mean they are superficial , they are just more tolerant of casual things . they would rather say i m fine when asked how they are , because that is a convenient response which makes people comfortable . someone with a fi preference , on the other hand , would be more open about how they truly feel . they are more likely to go on tangents . anyway , just thought i d share some info on infjs , haha . not doubting your typing .","244326":"take care not to believe the majority of people who claim to be an infj . i m an isfp , personally . but i just wanted to state that most people are uneducated on the subject of mbti . they go with whatever result they get on personalities , which is an unreliable , sorry excuse for a site . someone who types themselves as an infj is usually an infp , or at the very least enneagram . after all , they read that infjs are the rarest type , and both infps and type fours have a tendency to want to be seen as unique . these people do not have the dominant ni function . their fi is all over the place .","244327":"it depends on the day , really . i do homework practically daily . i try to write , but get distracted by various sites . i sometimes play games , and even record videos . i stay in my room for most of the day . on a terrible day , i have a psychotic and catatonic episode . on a better day , i probably cry over something minor , because i m too sensitive and have a mood disorder . on one of the best days , i am at peace with the universe . i kind of have a porn addiction , so there s that , too . and i live with trauma , and the perpetual feeling of never belonging in society . i m rarely bored . my parents fight all the time , so it s best not to go downstairs much . i do not have a job , so that responsibility isn t there . hm . yeah , if you want to be in my shoes , just have fun trying to regulate my moods be stable . it s hard , even with meds . but friends say they would never want to be in my place , because they d rather not deal with hallucinations and such . my living environment isn t exactly the best , either .","244328":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v syxmnji goq ab channel zettairyouiki","244329":"i always wanted to be different characters , to the point where i even put the name of characters on sticky notes each day and wore them . i told people to call me by a new name basically every day . the characters were mostly ones from anime i had watched mello from death note , for instance . why male characters ? i don t know , i just never find myself liking girl characters . i never wanted to be a guy , though .","244330":"i don t think things are that black and white . some good people suffer , and some bad people get off the hook . some good people do not suffer , and some bad people get what they deserve . it s probably some false perception , anyway . the only people i know who insist they re good are bad . then you end up with bad people who whine because they suffer . but because they think they re good , and maybe sound persuasive enough to make people believe that , they seem like a good person who suffers more . but some truly good people suffer , yeah . and i d say it s a matter of gaining wisdom experience . people can complain about their struggles or learn from them . it s up to them , really . some bad people do more to not get caught than other bad people . it s a matter of how cunning they are , i d say . but some bad people are in plain sight yet no one cares . i think they will care in the end , however . i wouldn t even suggest that all bad people deserve to suffer . i believe in rehabilitation over punishment . i do not believe in the death penalty . as for happiness , well , it s reliant on perceptions . you can be poor and still be happy , be in jail and still be happy , etc . or you can dwell on all the bad things . it s how you choose to see your life .","244331":"when my lover is offline for too long i m the type to spiral , so it s like omg , what if she died ? , any kind of conflict , when someone says something ambiguous to me , getting yelled at , hallucinations , being somewhere that has many bugs , being stared at , hearing people whispering , hearing footsteps in my house , being around a bunch of moving cars . . . .","244332":"i think it s fine . it s a transition phase , i d say around ages and . but the brain supposedly does not stop developing until , so you have years to mature , nonetheless . some suggest it does not stop developing until , even . i wouldn t say youth is an excuse to make a bunch of bad decisions , but the decision making part of the brain is still rather undeveloped . as long as you are focused on improving . i would say that represents maturity more than anything . immaturity would be accepting things as they are not wanting to change . don t worry about always making the right choices , because you aren t expected to . just aspire to make better ones in the future .","244333":"eh , if you are and a senior in high school , you are legally an adult , sure , but i think people would argue that going off to college is the start of adulthood . you can also be and in college , though . at the same time , not everyone even goes to college , so it depends on independence more than anything . but people are also on varying psychological developmental levels at that age . for instance , boys mature slower . so basically , it comes down to how mature you think you are , as well as whether you feel independent or not . i d say it s normal to feel lost , though .","244334":"people do not understand how attractions work . not only that there are different types or degrees of feeling but that everyone has a preference of some sort . if someone is attracted to the same sex , a certain age group , etc . , it does not mean they can t have a preference when it comes to appearance and such . they are not attracted to everyone in that group . this logic seems to fly over people s heads .","244335":"i think it s childish to have a black and white way of thinking and to believe that if someone commits a wrong action then they deserve to suffer forever . but if we re being hypothetical , probably hell , lmao . not because i do bad things but because people would consider my very existence to be sinful . i think it d be cooler than people make it out to be , though . just a bunch of devious people together , in this place that probably looks like the nether in minecraft . i d be discussing life stories with people .","244336":". showing humility being modest especially if you want to get a job and such . confiding in others . being honest no matter what . focusing on the present letting go of the past . thinking before you speak . cutting off toxic friends family members etc . . finding a creative outlet for negative feelings . not overworking yourself but also not doing too little . having a sense of order in life through a schedule , through taking care of your needs , and so on . trying new things well , they may not be the wisest of all , but i think they are useful .","244337":"i ll be frank this seems like a silly immature mindset to have at your age . your tendencies shouldn t be justified by ocd . i don t believe your meds made you healthy . it sounds like you could be a controlling person who is trying to find excuses for it make it out to be a good thing because you re just trying to be protective . and i m sorry if this sounds mean . i have ocd , myself , but i don t think this is a healthy way of thinking , even keeping that condition in mind . read about unhealthy enneagram type you might relate .","244338":"i think you act kind of obsessive . you wrote this i know i can protect her against this cruel world while providing the love she needs forever . and it reminds me of this character quote , which is why i chose it . but that character is very unhealthy obsessive , you know . . . it s not wrong to want to protect someone , but it can become kind of excessive .","244339":"yes , there are many resources ! i can summarize the types for you type main desire is moral correctness being correct in general , main fear is moral decline being wrong . type main desire is being loved helping others , main fear is being rejected and feeling helpless . type main desire is success being admired , main fear is failure being seen as pathetic . type main desire is having a special identity being seen as unique , main fear is being seen as boring having an uncertain identity . type main desire is knowledge , main fear is incompetence . type main desire is security , main fear is insecurity betrayal . there is such thing as phobic and counterphobic when it comes to type . . . essentially the unhealthy projects on to others , is vicious , and so forth type main desire is having fun being happy , main fear is boredom negativity . optimistic type type main desire is being in control of environment and self , main fear is losing control . type main desire is peace , main fear is conflict . the types each have a wing , those being either of the numbers beside them . for instance , a type can have a or wing . this means a type can have traits of a or traits of a . a type has an or wing , a type has a or wing , etc . the wings cannot be different than either side number . you cannot be w or w . everyone has a tritype a type in the heart triad , , or , a type in the head triad , , or , and a type in the gut triad , , or . my triad , for example , is , meaning is my predominant type , is my second type , and is my last type . my wings are w , w , and w i suggested w in the past , but i think you can have two types with the same wing . anyway , there are various enneagram tests , but i wouldn t recommend them over reading about the types themselves and identifying which ones you agree with most . the site crystalknows . com seems to have a reliable test , though . they got my enneagram type correctly , while other sites do not . here are some resources to get started https hedjumacation . net considerations uniqueness temperament enneagram https www . types . com writeup theory . htm there is a book called discovering your personality type by don richard riso and russ hudson , and i find it useful for beginners . there is an enneagram test in it that you can fill out . it explains how the different types can become healthy , what kind of relationship problems they may have , etc . it also goes into detail about the instinctual variants sx , sp , and so . the whole triad wing thing can get confusing for people , so i think you should start off with finding your type itself , , , etc . , then seeing which wing type you relate to more . people often say they relate to several types , and that s normal , given the triad . wings and the triad just explain why you relate to multiple types .","244340":"no problem . you can also figure out your enneagram type and read about it . enneagram focuses on your main desire fear , and the integration into peace or disintegration into stress . it identifies what stresses you out personally and how to manage it . it s simpler and more applicable than something like mbti . it s used in workplaces and life coaching .","244341":"well , not really , unless it concerns me . you have to help your partner , if they are not in the best state . my ocd is mostly just an annoyance . i had a compulsion to watch episodes of anime a day , so i could not visit a friend or anything always too busy . i felt anxious whenever my schedule was interrupted . my compulsions are not as extreme anymore things like repeatedly checking that a bracelet has not fallen off , or not touching doorknobs with my bare hands . my obsessive thoughts do not ruin friendships have not ruined my relationship . if someone is judging you for what you cannot change , you shouldn t be friends with them , or be in a relationship with them . if they are dwelling on their own past and their own things that cannot be changed , you should be there for them . that s what i think .","244342":"my delusions are common ones . that i m being watched , that my food is being poisoned , etc . paranoid delusions , delusions of persecution . i have had some unusual ones that bugs live inside my body and are creating a colony . i thought there was a man living in the wall of my closet , and that he took over my mind . well , i m an odd type of person . i did not share my delusions with people , did not impose them on anyone . my parents didn t know about them until i explicitly told them . when you think of a schizophrenic , you think of someone crazy who goes around ranting about having special powers and such . i kept things to myself , though . i did not appear irrational or illogical on the surface . i felt very detached from reality , however . how i felt was a great juxtaposition from how i presented myself , on this subject . i find it hard to openly lose composure . my grades haven t suffered from any symptoms , i ve never had a psychotic episode in public , etc . i m a very suppressed and seemingly collected person . the delusions made me distrust people , but they did not impact relations on a significant scale . i ve been more affected by the lack of empathy i experienced for a long time . it s given people this false , fixed image of me one of someone who is immoral , deranged , and so on . but the empathy has developed significantly these past few years . i m someone who is prone to extremes , either all or nothing . so , on the contrary , i now tend to feel too much empathy , and cry over the smallest things . the derealization depersonalization i experienced were the outcome of the hallucinations and delusions . i ve had a difficult time in public places , and sometimes just around other people in general , despite medicine . i become rather catatonic , and start having auditory hallucinations . but none of these things are as bad as they were in the past . and people oddly do not notice them , or remark on them . i am very good at fitting in , i guess ? even though several things are off .","244343":"well , if we re thinking in terms of evolution , sure . but i think people should wait for love , personally . we aren t like other creatures , who have to perform dances and such to attract a mate . i mean , i wasn t seeking a relationship , but i ended up in one . you never know what will happen , really . though i understand that there s this perceived ? social pressure on men to make the first move , while women are expected to wait . that s silly , though . people should wait or actively seek as they please , without regard for expectations gender norms . hm , but then you would call yourself indifferent more than hopeless when it comes to recognition being undesirable , i think .","244344":"yes , that must be what differentiates it from other fields . other fields rely more on theories , like chemistry , but given that psychological things originate from the brain something concrete , the brain is able to be studied , and analyses can be made . there are some interesting things that deserve greater study vision issues among schizophrenics , for instance .","244345":"you can consider it in two ways . hopeless romantic is a term , but it consists of two words . a person can be both hopeless and romantic hopeless not necessarily in romance but in life itself . similarly , a hopeful romantic is just someone who is hopeful and romantic . i would consider myself to be a hopeful romantic . i m not single or looking for a relationship , but i think i m hopeful and romantic . i write love poems and such . however , we can consider hopeless romantic and hopeful romantic as terms rather than individual words . a hopeless romantic , to me , is someone who has either given up on romance altogether or wants what they cannot have . a hopeful romantic , by contrast , is someone who is wishing for romance and or is actively seeking it .","244346":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v qfcncip yo ab channel benoitpioulard topic","244347":"yeah , might as well make use of my passions instead of pursuing only one , monetarily speaking . i had some other jobs in mind in the past , like being a detective or officer in narcotics . i really like research on drugs . but these jobs sound too demanding for what they re worth , i guess . i value free time . i ve been interested in psychology since i was probably around , and it heightened around . it s good that you ve discovered your passion , despite the timing . i think people try to get into the field for the wrong reasons to help themselves no regard for helping others , to learn to manipulate well , or because the human mind is so interesting . it s fine if they go into research with these interests in mind but i wouldn t recommend psychology for manipulators , of course , though they tend to have actual counseling in mind , which is the issue . i suppose it s alright to initially have superficial thoughts about psychology and then study it and expand on these thoughts , but it seems to be one of those fields that people regret majoring in , because they never cared much to begin with . anyway , i m rambling , sorry . that s true .","244348":"eh , it mostly depends on when you choose to have children . you should be financially stable before starting a family . of course , that isn t a always predictable matter . people have accidental pregnancies , or lose their job while pregnant , so while they were financially stable in the beginning , they are not by the time the baby is born . that s not really my concern , though . i m in a same sex relationship , so there s no chance of pregnancy without a sperm donation . and i ll have several sources of income psychology , book writing , translating , taxidermy , photography , and some other side hobbies to make money from . my partner is someone of various ambitions , too , so the finances will work out , i think .","244349":"i m unhealthy even with medicine , heh . but not to the extent that i used to be . not necessarily . maybe not greater relationship opportunities , but greater opportunities in other areas . though , i don t believe in breakups and such . well , there s no use in thinking about it now . what s done is done , after all . who knows , maybe you can get back together with her in the future .","244350":"some people would argue that monogamy relationships are unnatural , though . i wouldn t , personally . not really . someone who is being abused in a relationship would probably feel miserable . it s not their fault that they feel that way . of course , they are responsible for leaving the relationship , in that case , but people have a tendency to cling to both unhealthy habits and unhealthy individuals . that makes sense . . . but it s best to not think of the past in the context of regret .","244351":"i think i reject it rather than running from it . i reject anyone s feelings for me if they aren t those of my girlfriend . i am crude to anyone who expresses having a crush on me . but is a crush truly love ? doubtful . do i run from love in my relationship ? no , i am quite affectionate , and i accept affection in return . i find it unpleasant to talk of loving family members . i guess i run from that love , to a degree . i struggle to say i love you back .","244352":"well , not really . . . some natural things include reproduction and killing prey for food . following these things doesn t mean you will be happy . people get married , have kids , and get divorced , for example . it s better to be happy on your own than miserable in a relationship . what is most natural is satisfying your needs , and i think happiness is a need . you have to learn to be happy without anyone else s help . of course , that s difficult , though . at least for those who have tasted what it s like to be with someone .","244353":"publish books poems , get a psychology degree and become a clinical psychologist , photograph abandoned places around the world , taxidermize animals , translate novels and publish translations , master roller skating , get married , move and have a great house , have kids , create a game , make a documentary , get what is necessary to become a youtuber make videos , learn origami , create and sell leaf pressing art , learn to paint and draw , sew stuffed animals , become a good cook , learn to knit , birdwatch and take photos of those birds , learn about different rocks and minerals , maybe animate something . . . anyway , i have many plans .","244354":"ignorance . people choose not to educate themselves on things . it s more convenient to repeat what everyone else hears than to take the time to do your own research . i see even the people who claim to be open minded and hate ignorance saying ignorant and close minded things . few people are genuinely open minded . everyone should make a habit of looking into the validity of different things .","244355":"i mean , it kind of is . people have a tendency to wallow in negative feelings instead of getting better , because that sort of thing is addicting . they have the ability to feel better , through things such as perception changes or medicine , but they reject such things and choose to suffer . that s referring to mental health , though . things like a terrible financial or environmental situation can t really be helped , thus you aren t choosing to suffer . but when people use the word suffer , they tend to be thinking of mental health mental illness es . i have several mental illnesses , myself , but i don t like the phrase i suffer from insert conditions . it makes me sound weak and helpless . i m not disabled from these conditions . i can function just fine , due to medicine and personal will . these aren t minor conditions . do i let these things impact school ? no , i get all a s , and take advanced classes . do i let these things impact my health ? no , i brush my teeth and shower daily . you can wallow in your despair , in your symptoms , or move on . i do my work even when having a panic attack or going into a psychotic state . if i can do that , other people can , as well . i know it is difficult , but i also know they have it in them to do it .","244356":"something like this , lol . i love old cars .","244357":"grounding techniques . remember that the past is the past , and it s time to move on . you can t truly live your life , or appreciate it , if you re always dwelling on the past . use your mistakes as inspiration for growth , instead of seeing them as something harmful . emotional stagnation leads you nowhere . this would be easier for someone with a high se function , like myself .","244358":"yes , a fear of bugs , needles , fire , and diseases . my fear of bugs has been so bad that i can t leave the house . . . i think it s better than it used to be , though . i also hallucinate bugs . the fear of needles probably stems from my fear of pain . for some reason i believe i will die by fire . . . whenever i see a big one , i feel anxious . but these fears are still nothing compared to the fear of bugs , thus i wonder if i would call them phobias . to me , a phobia has to bring distress and i mean distress on a daily basis . i have a form of ocd in which i get obsessive thoughts about diseases , particularly stds . i once believed touching a marker after someone else touched it would give me hiv , for instance . even if i simply see blood , without touching it , i fear i have contracted hiv . i logically know that you cannot get an std so easily , but well , it s an irrational fear . sometimes a person accidentally spits when they talk , and it gets on me , and i convince myself it gave me hepatitis . i think like of people with ocd have these kind of thoughts . and i don t take meds for that condition , so .","244359":"with friends and strangers , direct . in love , probably a combination of all . i m not sure what exactly avoidant signifies , though . i mean , i avoid conflict at all costs , for instance . but another meaning of avoidant is ignoring avoiding how someone else feels . i don t think i m like that , though ? if they are mad , then yeah , i guess . . . . at my worst i m a hidden messenger . i start talking in cryptic ways .","244360":"strange .","244361":"i believe people naturally imitate others . they will stand like them , use their tone of voice , and so on . others deliberately imitate , through mocking the person s words and such . i do think naturally harmlessly imitating improves social skills . if you act like someone through borrowing their mannerisms while interacting with them , they will probably like you more . and that s fine , no worries ! you can give when you have more .","244362":"thanksgiving is a holiday rooted in the suffering of indigenous people . it is commonly romanticized , with portrayals of pilgrims having a pleasant feast with native americans . however , any educated person knows that was not the case . the europeans took over this land and slaughtered the natives . it isn t a holiday to be celebrated . but most people , i assume , do not care much about the actual celebration that is , feasting with the false pilgrim native encounter in mind they just like the food .","244363":"i think it depends on the hardship . if you get lung cancer from smoking , that s your fault , and it isn t about life being unfair . other things , like being born into poverty , are a matter of unfortunate probability , and thus things being unfair . probability is about luck . decisions , on the other hand , are personal and a matter of self control and freedom .","244364":"it s just my household eating together , and my girlfriend . i doubt anyone will be visiting . people shouldn t have gatherings at this time , anyway . we ll eat some great food and desserts . looking forward to the stuffing and pie .","244365":"here s a list of my hobbies roller skating reading about birds want to get into birdwatching writing reading manga watching kubz scouts videos playing horror games playing old flash games playing vns mostly yaoi ones reading about mbti reading about enneagram reading about astrology watching porn reading memoirs usually about mental disorders taking care of plants doodling not so much now that i m not in school reading about drugs reading about abandoned places want to get into taxidermy , improve sewing translating sometimes watching anime a show a movie eating spicy ramen it s a hobby , yeah watching youtube videos in general going on twitter nice bird pictures finding new words i love dictionaries answering things on ask bowling sometimes playing mini golf sometimes i also want to press leaves and make jewelry in the future .","244366":"i mean , people can do it before they get married , but i don t see the point of doing it with someone you do not plan on spending your life with . . . you can spend your life with someone without ever getting married , though . then again , i also don t believe in ever having a second lover . true devotion is only being with one person in your lifetime . but i can t impose that idealism on other people . they do what they want . autonomy .","244367":"they love playing with these cotton balls . this is a random pic of them from google . you can buy several toys but they ll always go after these balls , as well as things like dum dums . they slide them across the floor .","244368":"well , i see both a therapist and psychiatrist , so there s that . it s important to appreciate the little things in life , and to go on a journey of inner peace , and peace with the world . people often hate the world , but because this is too painful to accept or live with , they internalize the hatred . some mental illnesses do not require meds , in my opinion , and can be overcome without them meds can make those conditions even worse . but meds placate my hallucinations , so i don t really struggle with them unless i stop taking meds , which i do not plan on doing . i take medicine for my extreme moods , too , but does it help much , i m not sure . depressive episodes are usually caused by , or exacerbated by , cognitive distortions . these are also the catalyst for my catatonia and auditory hallucinations both of which i get despite meds . i would recommend reading about these distortions , seeing how they apply to your life , and rectifying them . i strongly believe in the fact that perceptions influence emotions , and fixing these perceptions can change how you feel . when it comes to ocd and fears , systematic desensitization is best .","244369":"i think i ve been productive because of my belief that feelings should not interfere with responsibilities . it is also my belief that people should be given the benefit of the doubt , which is why i ve given some individuals whom i knew would become bad a chance at being friends with me . i think writing should be spontaneous rather than planned , which is why my stories are the way they are .","244370":"i m always honest . i also do not lose interest in things easily , and i have many goals and passions . i appreciate things no one else likes , and can see beauty in everything . it s easy for me to focus on the good things in my past instead of dwelling on bad things . i do not break promises , and i fulfill anything i have to , setting my feelings aside . i understand how people function , and can predict what they will say and do . i do not reciprocate malice .","244371":"balancing what i want to do and what i must do . i don t believe in being productive at all times , regarding school work and other obligations . everyone has an obligation to make themselves happy , and to be productive in that sense . i want to be productive through both means , so i fulfill responsibilities while also fulfilling the responsibility of my own well being . this consists of things such as eating my favorite spicy ramen each week , reading only what interests me , and so on .","244372":"yes , if it makes something easier , or if you have some groundbreaking idea that cannot be executed within the existing rules . some rules exist for our safety , but others are more of a guide . this guide can be changed and made more convenient . for instance , your teacher may tell you to solve math problems in a certain way , but the way does not matter , as long as you get the same answer . in that case , the rule is more of a guide . there are rules everywhere , including when it comes to parenting or relationships . some rules that should never be broken are the following do not abuse your children , do not cheat on your significant other , and do not gaslight . these are immoral actions , after all . but math rules are not immoral , so they can be broken . if that makes sense . i suppose bending rules has more to do with following the rules and slightly deviating from them ? you may follow a recipe which is essentially a set of cooking rules but decide to add your own ingredients . and that s great , as long as you like what you ve created .","244373":"my mom hit a rock with her car and had to get it towed , so we ended up with little time to visit the mansion . it was a nice place , though . a woman who worked there gave me a free book , and an officer gave me a free collector s coin since it was my birthday . i ate some chinese food in the hotel because we couldn t drive back to the ramen place . i got some nice presents ! several games , a bunch of gogo s crazy bones , a couple books , etc . the trip has been interrupted by not having a car . but we have a rental now .","244374":"thanks . yeah , i don t think people should be very restricted . laws are in place for that sort of thing , anyway . everyone should think for themselves and develop their own sense of right and wrong instead of abiding by an already established moral code that is flawed and outdated . people can be divided more by prejudiced and non prejudiced than sinful and good . to me it s immoral to believe anyone deserves to burn for all eternity in some afterlife . i also think the death penalty is immoral . because these things aren t natural , they re man made . people enforce the death penalty , and people create the concept of an afterlife . these things do not exist on their own , unlike groups of people . my morality revolves around natural unnatural things . by unnatural i do not mean things that are commonly disagreed with but things that are cruel and enforced by people themselves . like slavery , for example , that is unnatural .","244375":"i think of everything as part of nature . even aberrations are natural . people try to ascribe morality to everything , but anything natural cannot be immoral example homosexuality . i believe in what is tangible . other creatures do not appear to have a god , so there is no reason for humans to believe in one , either . i don t rely on some god s moral code . i like religions that focus on individualism , such as buddhism , rather than ones that make an effort to restrict human nature with the concept of sins and such . but i do not belong to any religion . some just make more sense than others . i do not believe in an afterlife , but i do believe in reincarnation .","244376":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v eys klmuxde list pl f e c

of those stories are gone . they were not well written because i was young , anyway . they were mostly about demons angels and such , nothing interesting . i later wrote a story about two boys in an insane asylum . it kind of went in a strange direction , because i was writing it solely for my own entertainment . it transitioned from being about the asylum to being about the main character and a drug addict . there s a lot of murder and such . and the characters are gay . it s chapters long , and the only story i ever actually finished it says chapters , but i accidentally skipped one while counting , lol . it s not very well written , either , considering i started it when i was and finished it when i was , but it s interesting and entertaining , nonetheless . people tend to like it a lot , for what it is . i ve reread it multiple times . i also wrote a little incestuous short story about a boy who is in love with his mother . it was supposed to be an entire story , but i took a possibly permanent break from it , so for now it s just a short story . there is a book i ve been writing since with the intent of publication . i m on chapter right now out of around . i expect to finish it in , but i love having someone to read it while i m writing it ! it s about a pedophile serial killer and his stalker coworker , who is in love with him and wants to eat people . it s very complex and the best thing i ve written so far . my writing style completely changed , from being very literal to highly metaphorical . i incorporate metaphors from many areas of life , such as chemistry , biology , physics , psychology , sociology , meteorology , pottery , religion , math , history , music , astrology , physiology , psychiatry , economics , topography , oceanography , architecture , cosmetology , zoology , art , food , and so forth . i dedicate a lot of time into finding the perfect words for any given situation . this novel goes more in depth with human relations , social deviations , etc . the characters emotions also tend to be a direct reflection of my own mood while writing for instance , if a character exhibits jealousy , it s because i was feeling jealous at the time of writing that part . the beginning chapters aren t very good , because i was still transitioning into my new style , but the latest chapters are .","244380":"i privated it , so i

even deserve to live , and so on . hardships create a desire for validation . someone may ask themselves if they deserve love after a harsh breakup . it s a normal human desire . by normal i do not mean healthy , but it comes with being human . its origin is self doubt , or not feeling accepted by society . other animals are incapable of such feelings , but humans are prone to them . a degree of self doubt is healthy , though it can become severe . a desire for validation is created by society itself . validation for grades , work performance , and so on . society teaches people that they are not good enough unless they are perfect . perfection is intangible , and it s important to understand that and take pride in your work , regardless of how others perceive it .","244385":"one of the

all about how you perceive things . let s say you have acne , for instance , you could start thinking acne is beautiful instead of ugly . because people are conditioned to find certain things ugly when they aren t . it helps to agree with the nice things people say about you , because denying those things is a form of self rejection , and you create a cycle of loathing this way . you have to see life through the perspective of many cycles to really understand it , i ve noticed . people choose to ignore cycles , but breaking an unhealthy cycle , whether personal or impersonal , is the key

are just some nuisances who did not live here first . . . it s quite sad . it s a very overlooked issue . native american oppression is real and serious .","244403":"of course . it s important to increase your world view and see life from various perspectives , and i think visiting other countries gives you that opportunity . for instance , visiting an impoverished country and comparing it to the luxuries of your own . you can also see how they make use of what they have . i think culture has to do with creating things , and to create you must have supplies an imagination .","244404":"well , like i said , you can determine something is immoral if it harms someone else . of course slavery harmed people , as well as internment camps . back then it took guts to realize and express that these things were wrong . most people simply accepted them and didn t care . even if something is legal , it can be harmful . harmful immoral . but say , alcohol is legal after a certain age , and people wouldn t consider it to be immoral , because you harm your own body with it rather than harming someone else . drinking and driving , on the other hand , would be immoral , because you can severely injure someone else due to your own recklessness . if you are causing someone else pain suffering , chances are you are doing something wrong .","244405":"you can t really judge someone s morals , that s the thing . people judge based on comparisons . that person has different morals than me , therefore they re weird and dangerous . it ironically often comes from the people who act like they re so open minded . people can agree on morals as a collective murder is bad , for instance . but if you have a moral not based on social values and what you ve been taught while growing up , it must be individual based . let s say you think murder is good , then you very evidently have a socially unacceptable moral . the thing is that laws generally exist to back common morals , so you can judge your own based on such laws . murder is illegal , for example , so if you condone it then you have an unusual moral . i guess you should ask yourself if your morals agree with laws or not . but then some things are immoral without being illegal . cheating in a relationship , cheating on a test , backstabbing a friend , etc . and we know these things are immoral because they harm someone or involve deceit . those are two other factors to decide the morality of something .","244406":"i m a strong believer in people doing whatever they want , but that s actually not a good thing . what distinguishes humans from other animals is that humans have morals . you become quite primitive without them . human nature should not be suppressed , but you shouldn t stray too far from morality . however , morality should be individualistic rather than social based . think for yourself and develop your own sense of right and wrong . i think people should protect each other , sure , but only if it s wanted . no protection leads to anarchy . wanting to be safe is a basic desire that the majority of people have , if not everyone . in other words , laws are necessary to keep human nature in check , but suppression can lead to distress . so it s kind of a difficult situation .","244407":"focusing on the present instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future . you have limited control in life , so give up on trying to have more control . enjoying the small and special things in life . it isn t about something being major or simple but special to you . we all want excesses and things we cannot have , so instead we should take interest in little things that are overlooked . particular aspects of nature , for instance .","244408":"i haven t really consciously

think i am simple in comparison . but i know many , many words , from incorporating them in my writing . this includes random medical , weather , chemistry , historical , hair , architecture , pottery , religious , etc . , terminology . this is the only reason why i miss school , i like learning new words in various classes . it s nice to be called logical , considering my feelings can be quite irrational . and i admire your willpower and cheerfulness . it takes a lot not to be pessimistic when you are depressed .","244442":"it s inevitable with the lack of research people are willing to put in . for instance , if you asked the majority of people , they would say a pedophile is attracted to teens , when actually they are attracted to prepubescent children . people throw words around with the belief that they mean a certain thing when they mean something completely different . and they are the same people who claim ignorance is terrible . some people really think stomach fat protects the uterus , or that it takes years for body cells to be replaced . then they go around spreading misinformation . if they were actually educated then they wouldn t hold as many harmful preconceived notions . we are naturally judgmental , but we do not have to be .","244443":"i do not believe in the concept of sins . ignorance is bliss when it concerns people talking shit about you , because hearing what they are saying can destroy your mental health . choosing to be ignorant about something because it disturbs you the truth about something is unfavorable . i think this kind of ignorance corrodes your so called open mindedness . i find that the people who hate ignorance are very ignorant , and i can only chuckle at their hypocrisy from a distance . in general ignorance is good if it saves you from mental harm , but it is bad if it is causing someone else harm .","244444":"no , i literally never even leave my house , aside from sometimes during summer to go to the amusement park and such , and going to school is required during the year . i go out to eat sometimes with my family , and go to appointments . i eat alone at lunch , i do group projects alone , and i have no friends or social life . i have a few friends online , most of whom i haven t talked to in probably over a year . i had a group of friends in middle school , but once i started high school i stopped having any friends . no , my friends back then weren t dropped by me , we ended up going to different high schools .","244445":"it used to be that i had to go home and watch anime and could not mess up my schedule , but now i have no excuse other than not wanting to hang out with anyone . no one asks me to come over anymore , though . i went to the mall with a girl from school months ago , though . she actually did invite me to her house , but i said no because i was not acquainted with her friends that were coming over .","244446":"i went to this place practically every saturday before school was closed . i ve been twice since then . not to the same one we usually go to but one a bit further away . the manager wears a mask but doesn t even cover his nose with it . . . do people believe you only breathe from your mouth ? the cooks were not wearing masks , and two customers did not wear them but didn t get kicked out for it . they have plastic things for picking up utensils , but people did not use them , regardless , so you have many people touching the same spatulas . i hope i haven t been infected from their negligence .","244447":"yeah . one guy told me my opinion mattered like of everyone else s because of my age . i do not actually remember if he said , maybe it was or something instead , so excuse me if i have ever said a different fraction in the past . there were general insults like this one , as well as guys explicitly asking me for nudes and such despite knowing i was . when i stopped being open about my age , i stopped receiving harassment for it , but about a year and a half later , when i was , i started being accused of lying about my age , even though i wasn t even open about it anymore . first they were saying i was something and pretending to be , even though i never even said i was , and now they insist i am despite years passing . they act like my age defies time and i am permanently , like i ve found the fountain of youth . i m almost in college , i m not in th grade anymore . and the fact that they are like and harassing someone who they think is is very sad , to me . and they have some twisted , unfounded delusion that my lover is something , even though she is not much older than me .","244448":"in , when two friends abandoned me , and when i got a concussion . in , when i got on medicine for my hallucinations delusions , when i met my lover , and when some guy harassed me for something i didn t do and apologized for it . some unknown time , when i started self harming . in , when my lover visited me in person , when harassment from someone else became severe and i went to a mental hospital because i was very suicidal , when i was put on mood stabilizing medicine . in , when i stopped using that terrible site , and when i stopped self harming . in , when i was doxxed , and when i gained a sense of peace . . . hopefully it stays .","244449":"it was horrendous . i hate my legs , but they forced us to wear shorts , which made me feel self conscious and was a factor contributing to my eating disorder . the pe teachers forced me to run , too , despite a doctor note saying i couldn t because my ankles are fragile . as a result , i ended up getting a foot injury after running the mile and had to wear one of those special boots to heal it . i always tasted blood in my mouth after running , and i almost fainted . i never enjoyed any of the games they made us play , because i hate sports .","244450":"hm , you rarely see teens on here , though . ageists are so annoying and spew generalizations when not every young person is immature and not every old person is mature , maturity and knowledge are both individual based . plus i swear they never get over your age . i still get people thinking i m or , for fuck s sake , like just admit you can t move on and go away .","244451":"years of harassment over it . back when i was years ago , mind you , i was open about my age , and older men kept sexualizing me for it . plus people treated me a certain way for the simple fact that i was young , and they did not take me seriously enough . so ever since then i haven t wanted to expose my age all over the place . despite it being several years ago , i am still being harassed for it .","244452":"online harassment got so bad that i stated i would stab myself in the stomach and had to go to the hospital over it . that wasn t even bad , though . i was already strangling myself practically every day because i was so suicidal , and attempted to hang myself more than once . but i was scared to go back there , which compelled me to stop harming myself . took over a year to finally stop , though .","244453":"when someone reveals your location and other personal info about you with the intent of harm . so , my appearance is one of the few things that are actually private , because people want to invade my privacy so much . plus people on this site can be very disgusting and sexualize someone when they have pics of them . i already get gross sexual questions as it is .","244454":"if you mean in real life , well . . . in nd grade or so , i forget when , we had beetles and grasshoppers in a jar as class pets . it was my turn to take the jar outside during recess and watch over the bugs . however , i saw beetle and grasshopper legs everywhere . they had started eating each other . if you mean online , i have seen many disturbing videos , like a man s heart being torn out of his chest and eaten .","244455":"https youtu . be tc glssu m","244456":"just all the hypocrisy i see every day . people have contempt for gay conversion therapy , but they believe people with worse attractions can be cured through therapy . overall i see a lot of gay people didn t choose to be that way , they don t deserve hate ! oh , but this other person definitely chose to be this way , attack them . double standards regarding sexuality versus paraphilia . this deluded mindset that paraphilias are more corrupt and devious , i suppose . it s all the same , to me . no one chooses who or what they have sexual feelings for , so no one should be attacked for any sort of sexual attraction . that is what you call equality .","244457":"i do believe in zodiac sign compatibility . i think it s been true to my own experiences . but i think it does not take into account same sex compatibility . for example , they say scorpios and pisces are compatible . i am a scorpio but i find i am not compatible with pisces men , yet my lover who is a girl is a pisces and i am compatible with her . similarly , i have had good experiences with female pisces friends .","244458":"i answered this a long time ago , and i would have to write a long rant once more . . . . so i will summarize . i became very detached from reality and lost the ability to sympathize with others , due to a sense of severe ostracism from society , along with my father s alcoholism and other stressors such as bug infestations that triggered visual hallucinations . before this wave of depression and psychosis , i was quite cheerful and had a feeling of love for the world . i met my lover in , though i did not talk to her much until . our relationship was unstable for a long time because we were both in an unhealthy state . then came terrible online harassment in , though i had been harassed before on many occasions , whether sexually harassed or just normally harassed . anyhow , this harassment drove me extremely unstable and landed me in a mental hospital because i was so suicidal . i had started self harming around late ? because i felt so distressed , and it didn t end until december of , though i had a relapse in like march of . thanks to my lover , i was able to manage my sadistic feelings , and my desire to commit a crime because i had nothing to live for was quelled . after being on medicine for mental illness and experiencing her love and care , i regained my feelings of sympathy and fascination with the world , which were more intense than ever . videos of paralyzed kittens made me sob , and they still do . i am so sensitive it s not even funny , i cry over people s pain all the time , and animals being in pain . i cry even when a plant i have loses a single leaf . basically i am still a mess , but my emotional state has greatly improved . i feel peaceful , and i hope my lover feels the same way . but i guess this is long for a summary , lol .","244459":"i followed back . here s a list of some people i follow . there are others , but they don t reply to my questions , so . or they re inactive . or a couple other reasons . if someone who is following me sees their name isn t on this list and wants to know if i follow them or why i didn t mention them , just respond to this and ask ! sometimes i like someone s answers but don t follow them and need a reminder . this list isn t in any particular order . sorry if i tag someone twice .

what my therapist says about my ocd is that i feel anxious and thus my mind creates compulsions completely unrelated to that anxiety . i may feel anxious about school and studying , so i develop a compulsion to keep checking that my phone is still in my backpack , or that my bracelet is still on my wrist . what do these things have to do with my studies ? nothing . you feel an internal sense of dissonance and your mind seeks control on the outside , which creates even more problems . because then i have not only school anxiety but these checking compulsions i can t get rid of . i think our brain produces more problems if we cannot understand and solve the ones we already have . for instance , you might refuse to face your issues and overcome them , so you drink alcohol to distract yourself . well , now you have a drinking problem as well as the problems you are attempting to run from . we as humans struggle to deal with certain things , and we face the consequences . the reason why i say certain problems in the beginning is because some things are simply out of your control . like do i choose to have hallucinations in response to my environmental stressors , no , here it isn t a matter of running from anything . though to a degree , perhaps , considering with the derealization depersonalization triggered by these hallucinations , i was detaching myself from reality , rather than remaining grounded and having to suffer from it . i think this detachment is even more insufferable , though . the mind has self sabotaging defense mechanisms .","244461":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v mjag woae","244462":"exactly , this is why i think it s a form of self harm . even if not visible , it is still internal harm . i m very anti alcohol because my father is an alcoholic and i ve seen what it does to him . it just seems like a terrible thing . maybe if you have it on major holidays then it s okay , but if you re drinking every week or every day then it s a problem .","244463":"i think it probably happens with celebrities . you can see that someone is kind on camera , and you just know that they must be a great friend in real life . if you mean relationship wise , i m not attracted to people my age , so not really . i ve only ever been in one relationship the one i m in right now , and i found her interesting , but she was the one who contacted me first , so i suppose the feeling would be the other way around . i did have crushes when i was younger , like years old or so , but i ve always been an obsessive person and thus wanted to learn everything about them .","244464":"deep down in the dark loving you six feet underground eternal love i m loving you six feet underground i kiss your bleak lips part by part in light as in darkness my favorite pieces la carte in light as in darkness my love will last longer than death and night by night you ll be my skin and flesh","244465":"yeah . i mean , i wasn t okay before i was on medicine , i was very detached from reality and hallucinating on a constant basis . i was convinced that zombies were real , and that everyone around me was a robot and i was being experimented on . i rarely have visual hallucinations on medicine , but i hear voices whenever i become distressed . delusions are rare , and i no longer feel detached from both my body and my surroundings , but i m still paranoid , to a degree . i struggle with things like eye contact because i convinced myself people can read my thoughts just by looking into my eyes . and i still struggle with my moods , despite medicine . someone being even slightly mad at me can trigger a breakdown , and the smallest arguments can lead to a psychotic episode where i become catatonic and such . plus i take no medicine for ocd , since really the only medicine for it is antidepressants , which can have terrible side effects . my compulsions are mostly triggered at school , but obsessive thoughts are just there in general . i remember how when i went to the hospital , i was paranoid that touching a marker another person touched would give me an std . my thoughts can be irrational like that . but in case you get the impression i am very dysfunctional in person and it s obvious to others that i have these problems , that s completely false . my parents had no clue what was going on until i explicitly told them . it s hard for me to express how i feel , and everything happens behind closed doors . the only person who has witnessed my psychotic episodes is my girlfriend . and my symptoms do not interfere with my school work , i study a lot and get good grades . i m just your average person on the surface . i should note that i haven t self harmed in months , though . was the worst year . was very bad , and wasn t too good . has actually been fairly nice for me , even though most people probably hate this year . anyway , i ranted too much , lol .","244466":"thanks ! i m trying my best . i even talked to a friend until he was the one that stopped replying i figure because he is busy with work . . . i hope i didn t upset him somehow , instead of me . i m not sure how to have conversations , i m just so used to writing long messages trying to help people out of suicide . and i have wrist problems from typing so much . i talked to some british users back in the day , but i don t think i was ever really friends with them , so that would make you the first , too .","244467":"me reading the stupidest questions on here .","244468":"you just figure out which functions you have and which order those functions are in . like , intjs have the functions te , ni , fi , and se , and do do isfps , esfps , and entjs . but all in different orders . intjs have dominant ni , meaning they are mainly focused on the future . esfps have dominant se and are mainly focused on the present . isfps have dominant fi and are mainly focused on personal values morals . entjs have dominant te and are mainly focused on different goals and effectivity . it s basically a which do i relate to most ? type of thing , i guess . but it requires sufficient research , you can t just randomly decide on your type .","244469":"yes , the same people stay with you in each life . this explains why you may feel as if you ve known someone all your life you knew them in the past . yes . and they are underrated , to me . herons are so beautiful and graceful but overlooked . it would be nice to be a heron standing on a log , waiting for fish to swim by . or a squirrel climbing trees and hiding food .","244470":"i think that s more of a hindu concept , though ? i m not sure if people can become animals . i quite like buddhism , but i m not a buddhist . i think you are with the same people in each life . your lover in this life might be your parent in the next , that sort of thing . that would explain incest . but if i could be an animal , i would want to be a squirrel or heron .","244471":"the one i wrote from around was about two boys in an insane asylum , but then it became about one of those boys and a drug addict , and it was just a big mess . but i finished it . the stories i wrote before that one are basically all gone because the writing site i used shut down without any warning . i started writing one in about a boy in love with his mother , but i gave up after one chapter . i ve been writing another one since , and i m almost on chapter . it s about a serial killer pedophile and his stalker coworker who is in love with him and wants to eat people . i intend for it to be around chapters , and i want to publish it .","244472":"yeah , but it comes out of nowhere . intj and isfp are mbti types , and w and w are enneagram types . mbti types explain the cognitive functions you use to process the world in my case fi se ni te , in that order . the functions are complicated to describe . fi is all about personal values and prioritizing them over social norms . se is about living in the present and valuing physical sensations someone with dominant se would probably enjoy things like sports a lot , but mine is not dominant , so . ni is about insight and focusing on the future , and it emphasizes a single goal . te enjoys the end goal rather than enjoying the process of achieving that goal . someone with te is more decisive than someone with ti . te is also an objective function , while ti is biased . the other functions are fe , si , and ne . those functions are not in my stack but there are such things as a th function , th , th , and th . . . it gets convoluted . enneagram is more about fears and desires . as a , my greatest desire is peace , and my greatest fear is conflict . i have a wing , which means i also emphasize things like what is right wrong , and correcting myself and others . ones are perfectionists . i am essentially a nine with one traits . there are enneagram types and mbti types . there are enneagram type triads , those being gut anger , head fear , and heart shame . type falls under the gut triad , so the unpleasant emotion i feel most often is anger . while an is expressive of their anger , a represses it . a s anger is often expressed through criticism . eights are controlling and domineering people .","244473":"yeah , tinnitus is permanent ear ringing , i got it from an ear infection . i ve never had the

yourself . though people harass others and then wonder why they hate themselves so much . the energy you put out is simultaneously the energy you put in . naturally you will have a negative perception of yourself if you possess a negative perception of others life itself . as i say , you must look on the outside before being able to look on the inside and appreciate yourself .","244482":"it s all just stuff i do in my spare time . i used to do research on illegal drugs , namely meth , every single day for about a year , alongside research on abandoned locations . i do research on psychological conditions because i ve had an interest in helping others with them , and i have mental illnesses , myself . i do research on various physical conditions and medications for my writing , as it is full of metaphors . i feel like by the end of it i might as well qualify to be a doctor with all the knowledge i pick up along the way . i ve also been interested in pursuing detective work or being an officer in narcotics , but i ve decided to be a psychologist as it is my predominant interest . though i m a workaholic , so i also plan to be a photographer , author , and taxidermist , and i m translating a french book and plan to translate other books in the future . i m only fluent in english , so it takes about an hour to translate a single page , though i do it every day . i m not in university quite yet , but i will be soon .","244483":"i am able to set my feelings aside to do my work , so even if i am distressed and having a psychotic episode , i still do my work properly . it seems like not many people are capable of this their emotions overwhelm them and they get nothing done . i am very studious , and my photographic memory helps me . i also write well and thus score well on essays i got a the highest score on my ap lang exam , for instance . i can also read and type quickly . i m not quite sure how my faults fare in regard to succeeding . i m very conflict avoidant when it comes to arguments and basically have a breakdown whenever someone fights with me , but as i said , i do not let my state interfere with my work , so even when very unstable i get great grades . i am quite the determined person . but oh , there is one fault , like how i absolutely hate time limits , so while i am good at writing essays , i panic when i have to write one in minutes . i also develop these compulsions related to school , such as repeatedly checking that my bracelet is still on , and checking that my phone hasn t fallen out of my backpack . but these compulsions do not get in the way of succeeding , so .","244484":"i tried taking an antidepressant once and it gave me a big panic attack , and the next day i was unable to imagine anything my mind

certain medication i think seroquel , which i am still taking , and my entire body had this odd burning sensation . my vision became incredibly blurry , and i threw up in the sink i was showering , at the time . every now and then i have the same sensation despite not taking too much , but it s rare these days . one morning while getting ready for school i ended up throwing up from it . but yeah , those are my unpleasant medicine experiences . i have practically no side effects from seroquel , aside from the occasional nausea and burning , and my feet feel restless from it sometimes . i have

son of a gun , megalomaniac , professional killer , anarchy , wwiii , and stray bullet . with german industrial metal , i like rammstein , stahlmann , and oomph ! . my favorite rammstein songs are ich will , sonne , feuer frei ! , du hast , engel , mein teil , mein land , mein herz brennt , amerika , sehnsucht , deutschland , keine lust , zwitter , ich tu dir weh , radio , du riechst so gut , mutter , and links . on that note , the lead singer has his own music under the name lindemann his last name , and i particularly like his song skills in pills . my favorite stahlmann songs are judas , bastard , military lapdance , nichts spricht wahre liebe frei , angel der dunkelheit , leitwolf , w chter , and hass mich . . . lieb mich . my favorite oomph ! songs are labyrinth , gott is ein popstar , ready or not , augen auf ! , das ietzte streichholz , and sex is not enough . sexschuss by heldmaschine is a good song , too . if you re interested in post hardcore rock , i recommend any song from dance gavin dance , though i prefer tilian s vocals to the vocals of old band members and in relation , i recommend tilian s solo songs , as well . secret band is also great , and hollywood undead . and i like soil the stillborn by infant annihilator , though it took me a long time to get into it . some other bands are hail the sun , a day to remember , and i the mighty . paranoia is my favorite song by a day to remember , and my favorite song by hail the sun , too , ironically . not sure what my favorite i the mighty song is , but i like their whole where the mind wants to go where

degree of self worth . the intelligent thing would be to leave such a person , and certain people are capable of this , while others are too hopeful and imagine more favorable conditions . because if

the plague and such . julius caesar , they kind of skim over him in school but he seems like an important figure to read more about . native americans , because they inhabited this land before us and created such beautiful things . i think they deserve much more respect and attention their cultures are rather overlooked and their contributions and presence disregarded . basically anything i reference in my writing , from weather terms to aspects of space , because i love the world and want to learn as much as possible about everything i can . i enjoy very obscure vocabulary and want to find the various definitions and meanings of a word . i want to learn more about stds , mostly because i have ocd and reading about an std helps me to shrug my obsessive thoughts aside and not think touching a marker after someone else has touched it will give me hiv . using information to combat irrationality , that sort of thing . i want to learn more about criminals , because they all have a

does he play ? i don t know , at first i thought it was because i cleared my cookies and so the save file disappeared , but when i got to the elementary school and saved it , then kept playing and saved again before closing the site , i would go on it and my recent save would be gone . the school is a cursed location , i think . well , i guess they re all cursed since there are monsters

his own version of sh on the computer . you can actually play sh online , but for some reason my game wouldn t save past something minutes .","244521":"if you cannot see yourself being with someone forever , then do not bother dating them , for dating either ends in a breakup or a lifelong connection . do not mistake your love becoming less passionate as you losing feelings . in the beginning love may be intense and passionate , but it becomes more subdued over time as you grow more comfortable . if your relationship is always intense , it is one build from infatuation rather than actual love . a peaceful relationship is not boring , it is normal .","244522":"the common answer would be that it isn t harder to be connected to people , we are simply gaining a connection through different means . it is difficult to connect in real life someone invites you to their table to eat with them , but they are on their phone and do not speak with you . the only bonding is over whatever is on their phone . but on the other hand , you can easily find friends online . some may say online friendships are shallow , but that is dependent on the type of people you befriend , as i ve personally had some meaningful friendships . technology infringes upon us , but it also grants us greater opportunities . as for me specifically , i find most people and conversations boring , and i do not need friends . i also find it hard to relate to others , as they tend to be less open minded about things .","244523":"in response to your questions i m not quite sure how to answer your first question , because i do not know much about the economy economic programs that are currently in effect . and i apologize but i know little about the economic situation in other countries right now , only the united states , so my answer will revolve around the conditions here . regarding the coronavirus , i think the government has been foolish in their decisions , given that they provided money for individuals who are deceased , rather than giving those stimulus checks to people who are alive and struggling . if the virus were not so extended , they would not have to give out these checks as i have heard they will give out a second round in the future ? , considering we are already in enough debt and these checks further ruin the economy , not to mention the influx of unemployment precipitates those checks in the first place . in my opinion , there should have been more severe restrictions regarding people leaving their houses , visiting others , etc . quarantine has been more recommended than required , not to mention our incompetent president has perpetrated the notion that the virus is a hoax and acts as if the leaders of all countries decided to conspire against him with a fake virus , being that he is a narcissist . his reassurance that the virus has been dealt with is the reason why people are not taking things seriously , and why the virus is spreading and people are losing their jobs . to summarize , the virus continuing to spread due to the government s negligence more jobs being lost , stimulus checks being required failing economy . i believe the biggest factors instigating poverty are our terrible health care system without insurance , medical fees can be thousands of dollars , thus it is easy to go into debt and not be able to pay your bills and the minimum wage being too low . you cannot live sustainably on an hour , after all . anyway , i hope this helped even a little . as i said , i do not have much knowledge of the situation .","244524":"i disagree . there is a subjective truth and an objective truth . for instance , when i hallucinate a bug on my computer , it does not mean there is truly one on my computer . because no one else can see this bug my senses created , it is not credible . if i hallucinate a smell , others will not be able to smell it and thus i cannot convince them it is there . there is no evidence , my senses just betray me .","244525":"i like to write stories , whenever i feel inspired enough to do so . it s been an outlet for my own entertainment for years , and recently an outlet for my feelings , as well . i love to read definitions of words and tie two entirely unrelated concepts together in an abstract way . i want to convey the metaphors swirling in my head , and depict myself in the form of various characters .","244526":"assuming this love is genuine and is not backed by malicious intent , yes . i think people mistakenly believe hatred and a desire to correct others is somehow soothing and will heal a person , when on the contrary the primary factors in healing someone are love and understanding . controlling and abusive love will not save you , and will instead exacerbate your state and instill trauma . but gentle love both saves and heals . i can attest to this .","244527":"it s kind of a tie between we happy few and silent hill . i love the dystopian aspect of we happy few . the last couple of chapters of a story i wrote were greatly inspired by that game . as for silent hill , i love james delusional state and how his guilt attacks him in the form of pyramid head . the game accurately portrays suicidality , in my opinion , not to mention the soundtrack is beautiful and the proper ambiance is created .","244528":"i know that many people prefer socionics , but it s rather confusing . i think the type descriptions are accurate , however . but involving superego , ego , and id functions makes it hard to understand . i d need to read more about it . well , people do not bother to read about cognitive functions and thus believe they can switch between an extroverted and introverted type depending on how they feel that day . they just take the personalities test and go with whatever result s they receive , even though that test is unreliable garbage . this is why you find so many infps who mistype themselves as infjs , because they tend to be type fours and hear that infjs are the rarest type and want to be unique . and hm , i feel like the function definitions themselves aren t inconsistent , but the interpretations of them can be . it can be difficult to determine if a certain function is higher or lower than another .","244529":"i admit i do not know much about socionics , though . me , too . i hate when someone is like i m both an enfj and infj depending on my mood , as if your cognitive functions magically change , lmao . or if they use their result from the terrible personalities site . i thought i was a w intj for a long time , which makes sense considering they have the same functions as an isfp , just in a different order .","244530":"korea , i quite like the clothes there . i do not have exact names of people who wore clothes i liked , but something like this is beautiful","244531":"i still get depressed , but not as often , and not as extremely . well , there were several factors . i felt rejected by society , and experienced guilt for simply existing , which led to self loathing . my lover helped me with this . but then someone online started harassing me , and spread various false rumors about me for no reason . i became very depressed and suicidal , to the point of wanting to cut off my limbs . and my lover was distressed , herself . i have a tendency to feel what she feels , so her being distressed made me distressed . i ve been depressed since i was like , though , because i was emotionally neglected by my parents . and my environment hasn t exactly been stable . my parents fight all the time , and my father is an alcoholic . i became very paranoid that he was going to kill me . he s never hurt me , though . but i did witness him abuse my mother one time . anyhow , the perpetual ostracism from society , as well as never ending online harassment , is why i am depressed .","244532":"there have been many . but maybe when i was hallucinating all the time . i hallucinated maggots in my food , corpses , walls shifting , walls closing in on me , objects falling , animals and people in the middle of the road , bugs crawling or flying in various places , someone s face in my room , and more . i also heard several male voices screaming at me , telling me to kill myself , and convincing me that everyone was out to get me . i had the delusion that zombies were real , that everyone was a robot and i was being experimented on , that i was being watched , that there was a man living in a wall in my closet , that everyone was conspiring against me , that maggots were building a kingdom in my body , that people were plotting to kill me . . . i became detached from reality . yes , i started taking antipsychotics and now i rarely hallucinate have delusions , and i am no longer derealized depersonalized at all . it will all return if i stop taking them , though .","244533":"hmmm . i m not sure why , really . but i think two issues are the health care system and minimum wage . if you do not have health insurance , a minute visit to the emergency room can cost around , . different types of medicine cost thousands of dollars a month without insurance . i saw a hospital bill a teacher received after giving labor , and it was over , without insurance . people go in debt because they cannot pay their medical bills , and if you cannot pay off your debt , you end up without a house , without your car , etc . if you have no transportation , you cannot go to work , so you end up jobless on top of homeless . and if you are getting paid an hour , naturally you cannot pay your bills .","244534":"yeah , i have a lot of experience . i used to write three pages of text in notebooks back in the day . and i had small handwriting . then i d go online and type all of what i wrote . my teachers all said i was talented . i ve had a couple of my poems published in a school magazine . it takes a long time to write a poem , though , so i don t enjoy it much . at least you ve saved it !","244535":"here is just a portion from a rant i made on another site days ago because in reality sociopaths are people who have not felt adequately loved , and thus cannot love others or sympathize with them . as i ve said before , if you have never eaten a strawberry , how can you be expected to explain what it tastes like to someone else ? if people do not sympathize with you , you cannot sympathize with them . that s where the problem lies , and the reason why sociopaths deserve sympathy like anyone else . this denial of sympathy for them because they are terrible people merely for existing only exacerbates their failure to sympathize with others . if you do not want someone doing immoral things , not caring for others , and overall being cruel , then accept , understand , and sympathize with them . those things prevent criminality and the emotional ostracism from society . i wish people would understand that their constant rejection of a certain group of people inspires aggression . and i don t care about your statistic regarding minorities causing the most crime . even if that s the case , do you care to think about why ? i ve said it before and i ll say it as many times as i have to , your oppression of minorities and mistreatment of them is the reason why they commit crimes and act out . if you beat an animal enough times , it s going to attack you . that s what society does , they are vicious to these people again and again , and so close minded , that they commit crimes . are you really that dense to not see that your actions have consequences , and that this statistic is the consequence of your behavior ?","244536":"on my phone , or ? i play animal crossing pocket camp , crashy cats ,

excuse people make in favor of physically going back to school despite the coronavirus some children are abused at home . yes , but have you forgotten about bullying in school , or school shootings ? not to mention you haven t seemed to care about children being abused at home until just now , when it s convenient for you , in order to seem like a caring person on the surface . and if you ve never been to public school or if you went as a child but it was a small school with about students , then you have no right to interject on this subject given that there are schools with , students and over teachers , where hallways are cramped and people are pressed against each other . everyone is shoving one another because there is no room . not to mention there are bus shortages , in which there ends up being three students per a single seat . based on these factors , the virus spreading is inevitable , and going to school for two days a week rather than five days is not going to help it , because the virus can spread tremendously in a single day . janitors do not bother refilling the soap dispensers in bathrooms moreover , they neglect to replace the paper towels , so you re left with only water to wash your hands with and nothing to dry them with aside from toilet paper . and there are students who juul in bathroom stalls together . also take into consideration the fact that not everyone bothers to wash their hands , and people would sneeze and cough on each other as a joke . you prioritize children not being abused over them not being killed or falling very ill , that says something about your character . and school opening would not end the abuse , anyway . if teachers become sick and die , who is to teach the students ? school is not a safe haven as long as bullying and school shootings exist , neither is home a safe place for many . but it truly is ironic how people only care now . if you are so concerned about abuse , investigate . and do not act as if guidance counselors are so helpful with everything . many people have stated that they are useless , and when approached over someone being suicidal or getting harassed , they would just ask how their grades are and suggest that the reason for being depressed is not having an a in a certain class . that is how incompetent they can be . if you are so empathetic , take into consideration those who have their mental health ruined by going to school , rather than raving about children being abused at home , as if you ve ever cared until this moment . going there greatly triggers my ocd , while at home i m just fine and not fraught with compulsions .","244538":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v q yx qwjfdm","244539":"i dislike how you have to look someone in the eyes when you speak to them . i m schizoaffective , and one of the negative symptoms i have negative meaning it takes from you rather than gives something like hallucinations to you is avoiding eye contact , because i become paranoid and have this delusion that they can read my mind if i make eye contact . but people have this misunderstanding that if you do not make eye contact , it means you re lying . no , you could just be mentally ill . it s the same with autistic people , they struggle to make eye contact .","244540":"i am good at writing , typing quickly , getting things done on time , focusing on the present

remember it well , but i have no significant complaints about that particular year . though i think that was when a boy in school stalked me . i became more in touch with my devious nature in , though i joked about it and did not take it too seriously . i had an eating disorder in either or . in i lost the ability to sympathize with others . i was immensely distressed by my attraction , and this feeling of being rejected by society for who i was inspired an abundance of anger toward the world that became suppressed sadism . i was very emotionally unstable , paranoid , and depressed , and i experienced hallucinations and delusions , but on the surface i was logical and stable . i did not let my instability affect my interest in helping others with psychological problems . i was much too open and honest . i became a porn addict , and no form of porn was extreme enough . i met my lover near the end of that year . we were both unstable . i started taking medicine for hallucinations delusions . she accepted me for who i was , and it was through her that i could sympathize with others again . my sadism was alleviated . i became a much gentler person who loved birds and little things in life . but was the peak of me being suicidal , as i started being severely harassed online , which landed me in a mental hospital . i do not remember very well . i was still self harming then , but i was gradually becoming more stable , and so was my lover , to a degree . i still experience depressive and manic episodes , despite mood stabilizing medicine , but i no longer self harm , and i rarely have hallucinations paranoid delusions . i accept myself , just as i accept others . i remain open and honest , though i am more reluctant to give out certain information , as i am still being harassed stalked . i would say i am more peaceful as a person . in i was interested in committing a heinous crime , but i have no such interest anymore . the past few years have been traumatizing for me , but i think i have definitely changed for the better . i feel more in touch with the world around me . in , i was also depersonalized derealized . i currently love nature , and i consider myself to be a very understanding and empathetic person . unfortunately people do not take the time to get to know the current me , so they still see me as that immoral person i was in . some people just never move on from the past . it is sad when someone who never changes projects that stagnant inability to change on you , as well . i remain mentally ill , and maintain certain stances that are perhaps morally incorrect , but i am a much more caring and lawful person than i was .","244542":"well , assuming pause means stopping time , i would like to stop time in order to be able to do things i enjoy , because it is annoying for there to be only hours in a day , and for of them to be spent sleeping . i wish i could pause time when my lover visits , too . the time passes too quickly . i d rather not rewind because there were too many unpleasant moments in the past . there were good ones , too , of course .","244543":"well , they do not disturb . they are not particularly loud creatures , more reserved , from what i ve observed . i think it is the fact that they are so overlooked , rather than an animal that many people obsess over . there was a sense of purity about them , to see them standing in a green and murky body of water , all white or somewhat gray . something that is present and prominent but disregarded . and they are not malicious . in fact , they fly away if you approach them , similar to other birds . i think this retreating nature is something innocent .","244544":"i love going to south carolina and visiting the beach . the food there is also

intelligence , and grades only measure the ability to memorize information and regurgitate it . those with a bad memory or with a tendency to second guess themselves perform poorly in school and get called unintelligent for it . but they should know that it is not their fault . school does not measure the different types of intelligence , merely memorization . it is thus not education .","244547":"here is my personal view on religion as a concept , though i respect those who are religious . i posted this on another site . with religion , you are seeing everything from someone else s eyes . rather than am i doing the right thing in my opinion ? , it is am i doing the right thing according to my god s opinion ? it is all about how someone else sees you , rather than how you see yourself . it takes caring what people think to a completely different level , because everything you do revolves around your god and pleasing them . why not please yourself ? why not do what you want , instead of what you are expected to do ? this is why i think any growth is limited , and your views depend on what is sinful versus not sinful . this automatically leads to being close minded , because anything you perceive as bad must be corrected and forgiven , rather than just accepting that bad things are natural and thus not sinful . i feel like you aren t moving on in life if you re constantly asking someone for forgiveness with every little bad thing you do . you fail to recognize that things just happen , and things simply are . instead it s this perfectionist thing where you have to be pure and worthy of going to heaven . separating the world between pure and impure is already an issue itself . in other words , i think being religious inevitably leads you to be dependent on others and what they d think of you . you rely on someone else s moral code rather than developing your own morals , thoughts , and beliefs . you aren t living your own life but rather the life someone else wants you to lead . and that , i think , is what is so restrictive about religion , and this sort of thing is what breeds ignorance and shaming others for how they are rather than just accepting nature . it s like condemning a murderer because they ve committed a sin rather than trying to understand what led to it , what their psychological state was , and other things that are based on their environment . you are not focusing on individuals themselves , only their actions and the morality of those actions . moreover , there is this statement that if you are living without being religious , that is delusional . but keep in mind that all animals aside from humans live without religion , and they are just fine . religion is a man made concept . i don t think it s delusional to live without religion , i think it shows you do not rely on someone else s guidance in life , and to me that represents your own personal strength . religion assumes you are submissive to someone else and need them to show you the way . with no religion , you are in control of your own life , morality , feelings , thoughts , beliefs , behavior , and so on . so , that is why i am not religious , though as stated , i am fine with others being such , because we all have different views on things . i just find it restrictive for the aforementioned reasons .","244548":"hmmm . vocaloid

linked to survival tactics from thousands of years ago , proving that our bodies perceive loneliness as a life or death situation . however , rather than being a positive , this defensive response drives inflammation in the body that can be toxic . research returned from eisenberger s analysis of social isolation via the study of online gaming uncovers how the brain reacts when people are excluded from a game of catch . the results ? those who reacted negatively to the rejection returned brain scans showing neural activity linked to physical pain . these findings emphasize how emotions are more than just surface reactions and are key to a deeper understanding of the human condition and , thus , should be taken just as seriously as physical pain and sickness .","244550":"a solid ,

when i was not on medicine , i hallucinated walls shifting and pulsating , and hallucinated random things such as a fork hanging from a classroom ceiling . i was paranoid and had delusions of persecution , as well as delusions that zombies were real . i constantly wore wrist braces from injuring my wrists after typing too much . gym clothes always made me feel self conscious about my body , and teachers did not understand i had ankle problems and could not run . i spent years not knowing how to tie my shoes and had to ask random people for help . when i was very young i had trouble reading and had to take a special class for it , but as i grew older i read many books , which annoyed my th grade teacher given that i read books rather than going outside during recess . in middle school i got a concussion and was sensitive to lights sounds , which teachers did not care about , so my head hurt all the time . i became friends with an anorexic girl who was mean to me , and i haven t been able to shake her off since . teachers have not understood that i need to be listening to music at all times because my ears ring permanently , i become distracted without it , and i also hallucinate without it . not to mention years of being suicidal , self harming , and at one point going to a mental hospital . and being stalked by a boy who had a crush on me , having my seat at lunch stolen by a different boy who had a crush on me , and being stared at by other boys who had crushes on me . so obnoxious . my friends ostracized me in th grade for liking yaoi lmao . then years later they were like i accept homosexuality ! ! ! such hypocrites . i also had a porn addiction for a while and fantasized during school . and had homicidal thoughts because my head hurt and everyone irritated me . i m good now though .","244567":"oh yeah , the difficult thing is going back and trying to translate what i was expressing because even i forget what i was trying to say and then i have to guess . i do it after i finish each chapter , but seeing as how it takes me forever to finish a chapter , i forget much of what i was saying . i m trying to do it as i go along now . the first chapters are nothing compared to the recent ones , i m using more advanced terminology and metaphors . here is just a random paragraph i ve written niveous days swept across the windshield of a peripatetic vehicle . sho s former conduct susurrated in shades of braille . those derailed headlights still flashed in my dreams . exhaust pilfered me at the site of debitage . the airbag was a mere monosyllabic god in the firmament , yet a phyllid blood clot atrophied any sense of impending danger from panorama . i caracoled atop misery s cleft palate . his morality , once trabeate , hiccupped itself into a sanitation bin , arcuate under the pressure of various sinful syringes . it was contaminated i was stabbed by his diseased verity , unable to prevaricate in the decadent face of the death penalty . how i dreaded the redient opportunity of radiant malversation in the office of sho s tendencies . nonetheless , my solicitude was but a soliloquy the feculent thought meeting was adjourned , yet a coruscation of qualm could not be bailed out of prison . and here s another random excerpt while my thoughts caprioled , i loitered down the stairs , body furnishing maintenance issues . i recognized this permutation of an occurrence descend , then discover something askew and panic . however , the allele of unearthing was altered each time , jousting me in an altercation of virtues . the perilymph within the cochlea of my incorporeal soul issued a treaty between the floorboards as my frame articulated itself in vain . at times my emotional homeostasis was unamenable , placidity and disconsolation molding in tubal ligation .","244568":"i m not sure exactly how realistic you d consider them to be because in my head the characters look like anime guys lmao . they re all based off of me though . but the setting is kind of a european like japan . and no , because no one could capture my vision properly and the main factor of my writing is all the metaphors that would otherwise be lost on film .","244569":"because life is sad .","244570":"i made this statement on another site . not directed at anyone in particular but people in general . so , the thing about small talk is . if you are older than elementary school aged , or perhaps even older than you were in nd grade , you are capable of forming complex sentences . therefore this constant reversion to simple sentences that a child could create , how are you ? and hi , is elementary . you are an adult and can create meaningful long phrases , yet instead you choose to act like you have no understanding of the english language . and that is what is so pathetic about it , as well as the assumption that others are as shallow as you and so superficial to stoop to an elementary level , themselves . it does not make me boring for not wanting to respond to your ridiculously mundane question with okay , it means i am mature enough to want proper and effective communication that does not resemble a child s . i do not care what is convenient or comfortable for you , you act like a child and i do not want to participate , simply . and for reference , favorite questions are also elementary given that when you just begin learning french , they teach you to say things like my favorite show is or i prefer over . french teachers repeatedly remind you that this understanding of the language is extremely minimal and likened to someone who is or something . therefore the argument can be made that you repeatedly asking someone what their favorite movie is and them replying my favorite movie is blah blah is comparable to this meager french comprehension . if you would like to be treated as an adult then use more detailed sentences and stop using lowercase . it isn t cute , it isn t interesting , it s lazy and proves you have the mentality and intelligence of a child . how can you act as if you are so superior when you have evidently not learned to capitalize letters ?","244571":"assuming i am understanding your question correctly . . . . no , there are difficulties even with love , such as how you may love someone who does not reciprocate it . then your feelings are being held back . while love may be liberating for some , it can be restricting for those in an abusive controlling relationship . love is like a bird , but if it cannot find a nest , what is it to do ? you are free to love , but those feelings may not go anywhere , in other words , and there may not be any application .","244572":"i m not sure about common necessarily , but here are a list of misconceptions nonetheless , common or not . no , you do not pms during your period . pms stands for premenstrual syndrome , meaning before your period , so please men , stop using the argument that a woman must be on her period just because you made her angry . it does not take years for cells to be replaced . cells die and are regenerated at different rates , some taking a couple weeks , others taking longer . this means that you do not have to wait years for the touch of your rapist to be gone . and god this makes me so angry . no , pedophiles are not attracted to teenagers , ephebophiles and hebephiles are . pedophilia is an attraction to prepubescent children , meaning they haven t started puberty yet often ages and below or so . also , being attracted to someone does not mean you have offended , so you are not automatically a sex offender . as well , no one chooses their attraction , especially one that they would be condemned for . homosexuality isn t the only thing you do not choose , stop cherry picking where to apply logic and where not to apply it . also , not every minor attracted person was sexually abused as a child , that is yet another misconception . just because women have the right to vote does not mean sexism has vanished . just because segregation has ended does not mean racism has vanished . being mentally ill is not the same as being disabled . ocd is not being a neat person . you are most likely not hearing voices but rather your internal voice . auditory hallucinations are different from your internal voice . depression is not feeling sad sometimes . psychotic is not a synonym for crazy . schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder . psychosis delusions and hallucinations . zodiac signs and horoscopes are not the same thing . no , stomach fat does not exist to protect your uterus . your uterus is not where your stomach is . please learn basic female anatomy before making this statement . not everyone drinks does drugs . weed is not a saintly drug without negative side effects . there is such thing as weed induced psychosis , for instance . not everyone has a hymen .","244573":"perhaps not directly , but i believe people may unintentionally live up to the stereotypes behind their name whether good or bad . the name may affect certain aspects , such as how if there are two girls by the name of abby in a class , the teacher has to call one abby e . versus abby f . and such depending on the last name . i imagine that gets annoying . my name is rare where i live , so i can never find it on a keychain , heh . that is annoying , as well . apparently someone s name can influence how you perceive them , too .","244574":"no , he was planning on kidnapping someone , but i think he was too much of a coward to actually do it , hence why i did not take him seriously . he was going on about kidnapping a girl and having her develop stockholm syndrome for him . it was very strange . he played games all day and dropped out of college . he was very controlling toward me and took advantage of my kindness . i still have trauma from it even though we only talked for a month .","244575":"no , i think he wanted help with getting away with the crime . i just thought he was being an idiot . i m not sure if he ever went through with anything or not but i assume otherwise considering he messaged me yet again about a year later and i essentially told him to leave me alone . he contacted me because i would not judge him , most likely . but i severely doubted him .","244576":"yeah , they re pretty trashy at teaching about presidents in school . the main complaints about nixon were his reluctance to withdraw soldiers from vietnam during the vietnam war , his bad economic decisions , hiding information from the public , and taking certain actions without the consent of congress . but i feel as if he had a good character regardless , after reading quotes from him , reading articles about him , and watching a couple interviews of him . he did not have bad intentions and genuinely cared about the public . he also set the precedent for establishing peaceful connections with other countries , which i find important . he seemed to be in favor of feminism and ending segregation . he did not enjoy conflict and , despite being in denial of his actions for a while , eventually admitted to his wrongdoings and expressed remorse . in other words , he was able to set his ego aside , which corrupt people like trump are unable to do . i feel like nixon has had a bad reputation due to his actions but his character is often overlooked . in my opinion , someone s character is their most important feature .","244577":"they seem rather interchangeable . money is power , power is money . someone who is powerful is often perceived as being dominant intimidating , but it is the powerful people who tend to have money . money can silence the masses . a person can only do so much , but money controls the world . while we are not all influenced by a single powerful person , we are all influenced by money .","244578":"i dislike how people throw the word phobia around casually . a phobia is something that harms your quality of life . it is not something like oh , i m afraid of spiders . a phobia is actively avoiding something , constantly thinking about it , etc . i have

maggots in my cereal . i also have mysophobia stemming from my ocd . i see counters and such as being infected with germs . i fear touching something after someone else has touched it . i have obsessive thoughts that sitting on a toilet will give me a disease , and struggle to touch doorknobs with my bare hands . i fear that everything has microscopic blood on it . as for fears , rather

authentic .","244581":"it isn t possible . please read about cognitive functions to solidify your type . you never switch types or can be more than one type . one major difference between isfps and isfjs is that isfps have dominant fi , meaning all decisions are based around their personal values morals , and they do not wish to conform with society . they greatly care about self expression and individualism . one example of an isfp is prince . isfjs have fe , meaning they value social values more than personal values and their morals are aligned with commonly accepted morals . they prioritize the values feelings of others over their own values feelings . isfjs are also more traditional due to dominant si , and emphasize the past , whereas isfps have se and thus focus on the present and being spontaneous . which sounds more like you ?","244582":"yeah , the majority of tax dollars go to the military . the military here has more money than all the other countries with the highest amount of money spent on their military . a lot of it also goes to social security . whereas the least amount of tax dollars go toward things such as space exploration , which i feel is important . but people here are delusional and think socialism is a bad thing and we should not become like european countries with free healthcare , because taxes will go up . if the government cut military spending then maybe they could actually pay off the national debt . hospital bills can be over , , and medicine can cost thousands , too , but we do not get paid enough to deal with those expenses . they act like everyone is rich . and we already have socialist things in our society , such as public libraries , the post office , public schools , etc . socialism is not dangerous like

causing lung cancer it s all about profiting off of tobacco . people get paid an hour and cannot feed their children . millionaires and billionaires hoard all the money . i have no job or money ,

of necrophilia , suicidality , pedophilia , and other interesting things . i started writing a story about a boy who is in love with his mother , but it was just a chapter long as i kind of gave up on

do not rely on some higher power for peace and happiness , though i have no problem with those who do . some people use religion to answer life s basic questions . why am i here ? who created me ? how should i live ? who am i ? but i do not care to find an answer . i know who i am , from my own self observation , and i am here because my lover wants me here . anything else i find irrelevant . i

so badly that i had to go to a water fountain and cried there . you know when you re coughing and tears come ? that kind of thing . well , sometimes the sky makes sounds that do not resemble thunder , they are more like strange noises , and i couldn t explain it . that s not even the worst of it though .","244593":"something i wrote a few days ago . i modified it . you decide what is moral or not , and to begin with , any attraction is moral because no attraction is chosen , all attractions are nature based , and what is natural is moral by default . otherwise you begin to argue that a cat killing a mouse is immoral because murder is immoral . but it s natural for a cat to kill a mouse , because it needs to do that to survive . any urge you have is moral , because any urge is natural . we shouldn t ascribe morality to emotions . the feeling of arousal cannot be immoral because arousal is natural . natural moral . morality can be ascribed to actions , however . but we as humans also choose which actions are moral or not . in other words , you are not corrupt for any feeling or urge you possess , but some would argue that your actions are corrupt . but what is corrupt ? something harmful . therefore if you are not inflicting harm , there is no immorality to your feelings or urges . morality only concerns actions . and what is truly immoral ? denying yourself emotional expression , denying yourself the ability to act upon that urge . restriction , painful and torturous . so then , again , what is immoral ? corrupt actions , as well as the suppression of one s urges and feelings . but then , you see , the more you suppress them , the more likely you are to explode and to act upon those urges feelings . both suppression and actions are detrimental . such is law , both suppressing and provoking various urges . nature does not care for this so called social morality , this your actions are corrupt mentality . nature goes , here is how you feel , now free those feelings to be at peace . immorality is suppressing nature . it s an interference with what has been determined of you . understandable criticism your actions are immoral . extreme , unnecessary , unnatural criticism your feelings are immoral . feelings are moral , actions are either moral or not , immoral meaning corrupt , but what is most immoral is the denial of the self and the suppression of your feelings , leading to self sabotage , depression , etc . no feeling , no urge , is more disgusting than another , nor more corrupt . i do not support corrupt actions , but i will support all feelings , no matter their nature . it is only if the feeling becomes an urge and the urge becomes a harmful action that there is a problem , or if the feeling is distressing to oneself . you are a man attracted to another man ? there is no shame in it , for feelings are feelings . and this mindset is not limited to the accepted feelings that are not chosen , but all feelings that are not chosen . not just homosexuality but far more socially unacceptable desires . i accept all and criticize none . only those who choose to accept this desire over that one . all desires are humane , but all actions are not . yet i am understanding of actions , as well .","244594":"it sucks , it feels too awkward , i have nothing to say to anyone . i know people who eat in separate rooms , while watching tv , etc . i just eat as quickly as possible and then run upstairs . it takes me forever to bring trash downstairs , i couldn t imagine eating in my room . yes , and i hate when you cough in class and everyone has to hear it . i always have like two bags of cough drops on me at all times , though . they do not allow cough drops in school but would you rather hear me cough or ? ? ? so foolish . at least the sky tried . being sick is not cute though ! but you know what is cute , i always called it the sky making sounds because i did not understand the sounds were from thunder . it took me until like last summer to realize , i am quite dumb . my girlfriend still laughs at me over it .","244595":"because here we all eat at the table , and no one speaks a word , because there is nothing to say . ohhhh , i see . here it rains often during the summer . it rained today , in fact . yes , i get sick maybe twice a year for about a week each time . though it s just a cough sneezing , no vomiting . i think the last time i threw up was years ago . surgery for what ? what is cute .","244596":"that s not so bad , i get sick for maybe days or so , i d have to count . i never exercise so i try not to eat too much so i won t gain weight . i used to have an eating disorder and starved myself . now i just have tendencies . smh , you are exaggerating , you are not fat . you have me , though . same , i never leave my room or house . my parents always complain that i only go downstairs to eat .","244597":"rather than a single event , i wish i could undo the years of self loathing i ve endured as a result of feeling ostracized and hated by society . consequently , i wish i could undo the various attempts at my life and strangling myself out of desperation . what i regret is not the things i said in the past , nor any action , but how i ve treated myself . i have done nothing to deserve the mistreatment of others , nor the mistreatment of myself toward myself . i regret the suppression of anger that was thus turned inward . i would like to undo driving my lover unstable due to my own instability , and having her deal with me during catatonic and psychotic episodes . i cry when i reflect on what i ve done to myself .","244598":"this whole thing about not trusting anyone is so edgy , i have a great instinct and know who to trust who not to trust , a black and white mindset is so foolish . i can know practically everything about someone based on very little information , my intuition is much too good . people are very predictable and their intentions can be read from far away . if you do not have the natural ability to sense whether you can trust someone or not , you should improve upon your observation skills . luckily that sort of thing is easy for me because i have always been an observer . i have been betrayed in the past , as well as abandoned , but i predicted it each time , precisely because i am able to see through everyone . not everyone is out to get you , i promise , and persecution complexes are ugly .","244599":"the people should overthrow the government . but i guess that s only an american concept , really . still , it s the people versus the government at that point . that s true , but it s a matter of being safe where you live . i don t remember all the names of them , but i ve listened to many of their songs . a friend of mine showed me the music video for animal i have become in th grade and i was like this is so edgy . and goodnight ! don t get robbed while i m away .","244600":"oh no , my browser history is a mess , though i m not ashamed of anything recent , so maybe that s fine . the last pics involve pics of me , so i d rather delete all pics of me before making those images public , i just take pics of my cats otherwise . if i can t remove pictures of me before the go public then my search history is better . i think i cleared it not that long ago , anyway .","244601":"i ve only had one lover . i ve been with her for two and a half years . i ve never been interested in relationships . i am not attracted to people my age whatsoever , and hardly attracted to anyone older . i thought i was incapable of loving someone or being in a relationship , because i was so unfeeling at the time . i thought no one would accept me for who i was . luckily she accepts me , and even understands me better than i understand myself .","244602":"i do . my best friend from rd th grade understood me well , but i moved before th grade and we hardly talked that year , then i lost contact with them completely , aside from one occasion . my friends from middle school were great , i miss them , too , we ended up going to different high schools . i never made any friends in high school , but i feel friendship is unnecessary . i do not crave friends . i stopped talking to all of my online friends . they disappointed me when i needed them most . some of them did not , however , but i struggle to maintain consistent contact with anyone because everyone bores me and i have this inclination to leave conversations immediately after they begin . it s difficult to trust them after what i ve been put through , even though some of them are genuinely nice people . but as i said , i do not require friends , anyway . i do not experience loneliness very often .","244603":"not really . if i write a memoir about my life , that is factual information . facts do not all have to be little pieces of information , they can be a series of information that is verifiable and lacks discrepancies . what you are referring to are things without bias . like how spiders have eight legs . that is factual information that cannot be refuted , and there is no bias involved . so sure , if you d like to find unbiased information , read such reference books , but otherwise information comes with bias as it can be told from various points of views and people with varying intentions , emotions , beliefs , etc .","244604":"so many things , i don t know where to start . well . when i was , i was open about my age online , because i wanted to be as open as possible about everything . people praised me for it . i ended up hiding my age as a result of repeated sexual harassment by men , as well as ageism i faced on a daily basis . i never lied about my age , however , i just wanted to hide it , but then idiots spread rumors about me lying without any evidence to prove it . it has been years since then , yet some people still think i am thirteen or fifteen , even though i stopped talking about my age after thirteen . i discovered my unusual sexual attraction when i was thirteen and was in denial about it for a year . i went into a state of distress when i finally accepted it , and this guilt for who i was triggered auditory hallucinations , as well as worsening the visual hallucinations i had developed months prior . an important friend abandoned me on christmas eve of . as a form of coping , i became emotionless , though not intentionally . i began to struggle with manic and depressive episodes . i acted very logical on the surface , and stopped feeling sympathy for anything . if you feel no one cares about you , you can t care about others in return . but i was quite unstable and emotional behind closed doors . this emotionless appearance was a facade , not created to lie but created as a defense mechanism during a state where i was vulnerable . i met my lover later on , and she genuinely cared about me . she took down this barrier i had created , and i started feeling sympathy and other human emotions in the most intense manner , given that i already had a mood disorder and felt intensely . but people have not seen this growth , because they haven t talked to me personally . they act like i am still that very sadistic and immoral person , but i have actually become very moral and caring . the sadism is still there , but not as strong as before . at one point i even wanted to go to jail , feeling i had nothing to live for , anyway , but i no longer feel that way or have that desire . never have i lied about my age , or anything online whatsoever , for that matter . unless you count when i was and told people i was a guy rather than a girl , lmao . there is also a misconception that i m autistic and lack self awareness , but the issue is i have too much self awareness and i m way too open and honest for my own good . my psychiatrist and psychologist have explicitly stated i m not autistic . i think quite figuratively , while autistic people are literal . my writing is full of metaphors . schizophrenics are like that in general , their lives are very symbolic . and yes , i still have my attraction , it hasn t gone away as some believe it would . and why would i lie about having it , who lies about something that they know would cause people to harass them nonstop . like hello , i m a sadist , not a masochist . and no , i have never harassed anyone who has harassed me . yes , i did go to a mental hospital over the harassment .","244605":"interests helping people , writing long messages , writing stories , conducting research , learning , watching pornography ,

i met my lover online , but it was not love at first sight . i actually almost blocked her in the beginning because she was underestimating me , but about a year later we finally had a lengthy conversation and i fell in love with her shortly after without ever seeing her appearance , mind you . we ve been together for around and a half years . and no , it isn t an online relationship , considering we ve met in person numerous times , and she has spent two summers at my house . i do not believe in love at first sight in real life because you cannot love someone without knowing anything about them that is , the feelings people develop upon first sight are based on appearance . people are more open online , and you know that if you love someone without having seen their appearance , the feeling is more genuine .","244607":"basically any dance gavin dance lyrics , they re very reflective of the flaws of society . i like these lyrics from joy division , though i ve been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand , could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man ? these sensations barely interest me for another day , i ve got the spirit , lose the feeling , take the shock away .","244608":"it s rather presumptuous to assume all of them were molested . certainly , if someone experienced ongoing rape molestation as a child , they may normalize either the sexualization of children or family members , but that is a matter of probability , as not everyone does . there are various factors , but all sexual romantic feelings are natural given that they are not chosen . no one chooses who they are attracted to . i wouldn t necessarily call it dysfunctional . perhaps a learned behavior , or perhaps just a natural phenomenon . if it is a learned behavior , there may be a chance of breaking the sexual romantic association with family , but i haven t read much about it so i m not willing to suggest that it s curable . if not a learned behavior , then certainly not treatable . nor worthy of condemnation , in either case . no one deserves to feel guilty for any sexual or romantic feelings they harbor , no matter the object of those feelings . of course , there is a difference between having incestuous feelings versus acting upon them . i have no judgment either way , though offspring with a family member can result in birth defects , so i wouldn t recommend having children with someone you are related to .","244609":"veganism is like some infection that is rapidly spreading these days , perpetuated by people with superhero complexes who think they re saving animals from harm . abstaining from eating meat does not fix the animal abuse within the meat industry itself . maybe you were hurting yourself in your sleep . good afternoon . i don t know what the time is there .","244610":"the majority of anime i ve watched have been comedies . i don t care for sad series . none of my siblings watch anime , aside from one of my sisters every now and then . there are plenty of people who enjoy watching anime , and like sad anime specifically . your logic is flawed and you re making far reaching statements with no evidence behind them other than a single shared interest that doesn t even exist . i don t think this guy even comes from the same country as me . so shoo .","244611":"she appears in various dreams . in a dream not too long ago , she was married to another girl at school and they had a baby who could only eat vegan food . . . it was so confusing . they wanted me to find food in a store . i see , i wonder if it represents wanting to hurt yourself somehow ? how were you really hurt ? and goodnight , by the way ! i hope you have a nice rest of the day .","244612":"it s hard to say . i think it s all about the intention . some things are obviously offensive , but i think people should be allowed to share in another culture s beauty by wearing their clothing . the whole this is ours and you aren t allowed to have it mentality is flawed . shouldn t it be about wanting people to appreciate your culture , rather than alienating them from it ? but anyway . i think it is offensive for a white person to dress as a native american , for instance , unless they bought the clothing from a native american seller , because if they are selling it then they do not mind you having it , clearly . but keep in mind that not everyone has bad intentions , and if they make a mistake and you find how they dress inappropriate , point it out to them so they can fix it , rather than acting like they had malicious intent when they did not .","244613":"hope this works .","244614":"notebook ? i m using my pc right now . i am either on my bed or sitting in my chair , but both become painful eventually . i see . it s kind of taboo not to shave as a girl , but if my hair isn t dark , i see no problem with it . so , you wouldn t use contacts because they are dangerous , but you would ride a motorcycle despite it being dangerous ? i like that car , it s interesting .","244615":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v ftnzdwkokjy","244616":"i have a place online where i write rants , criticisms , and general statements about life my feelings . i think it is essential as something to rely on and return to in the future . like i stated in one of said posts either yesterday or the day before , imagine if someone has committed a crime and you are a witness , and a police officer asks what were you doing on that day ? and you can show them all the things you were saying , doing , and feeling that day . it s evidence . it s thinking ahead . plus if someone asks you for fun , what were you doing on january rd , ? , you can show them exactly what you were doing that day . i do not have a positive association with writing in a legitimate journal , however . my family members betrayed my privacy time and time again , reading my journals without my consent .","244617":"i spent hours and hours typing very lengthy messages practically every day for months , and my wrists eventually gave up . i no longer type as much because my wrists hurt all the time . this is partially why i struggle to maintain conversations with people and leave randomly . but isn t that an app for your phone ? so you are typing on a screen , not on the computer , right ? phone typing is fine , but computer typing is painful . how , though ?","244618":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v f qldgkxoxe","244619":"those who seek constant intensity in a relationship are only seeking exhilaration . the beginning of a relationship may be intense , but it will naturally become more subdued and calm over time . unfortunately this is when people give up on the relationship , finding it boring , not understanding that it is not supposed to be intense at all times . if all you want is intensity , do not bother being in a relationship with someone , because you are likely to cheat on them . passionate love is mere infatuation , while peaceful love is genuine .","244620":"that s understandable , they give my girlfriend a headache , too . but maybe there is another issue with your eyes , then ? there is an eye condition that gives you headaches . when was this ? and how did they get into your house or was it somewhere else ? well , i just never wanted a phone . it was offered to me before , as i recall , but i said no . then i decided i wanted one . i m glad you understand .","244621":"they seem inconvenient , like if you want to ride a roller coaster or something and cannot see where you are going , when the scenery is the best part . it s a shame how some people have bad vision and others do not . but they are dumbphones to me . i mean , i imagine the story i m writing would be hard to read for a non native english speaker , as it s a struggle for even native english speakers , but maybe my old story ? who knows . it s long and entertaining , at least . i finished it years ago .","244622":"venus in th house jealous , domineering , a tendency to get into toxic relationships to get info on your empty th house , you need to see which planetary ruler is on the cusp , but generally it means that there is less of a limitation , as in you do not have to adhere to the traits of the planet in that house . essentially it signifies that marriage relationships are not so rigid , but in this case both individuals might be jealous , controlling , and abusive in the relationship , and even seek that behavior in each other .","244623":"yeah , i fell down the stairs in my house . i was sensitive to lights and sounds for a long time after , and felt very angry because everyone around me was unintentionally bringing me pain . my head hurt all the time . i am no longer sensitive to lights sounds , but i continue to have headaches , just not as frequently . i had never experienced a headache prior to the concussion .","244624":"my favorite is my writing . i like talking about mental illnesses , illegal drugs , paraphilias , abnormal fetishes , personality types mbti and enneagram , criminality , schizophrenia , murderers , birds , and anything devious depraved . i hate discussing favorites such as favorite movies , bands , shows , and so forth . i hate talking about politics , celebrities , history aside from the middle ages , how my day went , food , shopping , drawing , instruments , school , and any small talk subject .","244625":"i started using the internet for the first time . i played animal jam and was paranoid because i was stupid enough to give someone my password and they hacked into my account and stole my items . i think i was taking dance lessons back then . i had a friend in school who copied everything i did and stabbed me in the neck with a pencil , but i got in trouble for her stabbing me . we stopped being friends .","244626":"i hate when someone does not cover their mouth when coughing sneezing , it s like they intend to infect people . no , not for very long . i never had an inhaler or anything , i used a breathing treatment machine at home , and it contained steroids , which doctors suggest was the reason for my early puberty . they can be cured if you treat them early enough , but some people have asthma even into adulthood . i ve had a skin condition called psoriasis all my life , though , and it s incurable . what . people are always critical of at least one part of their body , it seems . my legs look okay in pants but ugly in shorts .","244627":"i feel like i just never go outside enough to get the flu . but people in school get it all the time and yet i never get it from them , so . there was a flu that went around years ago and my sister was the only one in her class who did not get it , everyone else was sick and absent . so maybe it s hereditary . not to mention we were breastfed for years after being born , and you get antibodies from that . lol how would religion cure you . no , i had asthma when i was very young but it went away because i had breathing treatments . i love legs but mine just aren t good .","244628":"it s strange how you can get sick despite it being hot outside . i always get an ear infection around the time summer begins . true . i get what you mean . have you listened to phem s cover of it ? she has a beautiful voice . while the song is about being detached from society , it is also quite self loathing for various things like appearance , which isn t fair . but who am i to talk , i just said in another post that i hate my legs .","244629":"wow . at least you weren t one of them . in my state around people die per day . or maybe that is how many people contract the virus , i m not sure . i never go outside anyway . yes , and they come up with conspiracy theories that the virus is fake , as if the leaders of all these countries just decided one day to pretend there s a global virus . those people must be more schizophrenic than i am or something . you are not trash though . someone who is trash does bad things , like harassing innocent people and trying to justify it . if you do not have bad intentions , you are not trash .","244630":"no , but school already ended on its own , anyway . they are opening things up here but now even more people are dying because the way they deal with things sucks . other countries are at least smaller and can manage a virus , but the united states is very big so it just spreads from person to person . not to mention people here are negligent and self centered . you aren t ugly though .","244631":"one true pairing . your favorite ship . mine is yashisato .","244632":"not my meme .","244633":"i hate hot tea , i can only drink it iced and sweetened . drinks should not be hot in general , unless it s hot chocolate . that s true , but water is lame , it doesn t go well with most foods . i had this compulsion to pick at my cheek , and it went away , but now it s back again and my cheek is all dry and gross . he s a gray tabby . you always complain that it is too hot .","244634":"yeah , that s why if you go see a doctor and they cannot find your vein to draw your blood , they make you go drink water . they can never find mine because i m always dehydrated . that s kind of weird , it should be the opposite . i love my cats . he was licking plastic in my room and it was annoying , but now he s being cute so i forgive him . i want to let him lie there but i need to shower . chicken is good .","244635":"the more hydrated you are , the more prominent your veins are , too . i hardly drink anything so my veins do not show . i understand your struggle , you cannot do anything with bad internet . you upgrade yourself by fixing cognitive distortions . i m just worried because my phone will not charge no matter what and i hope it s alright . my cat is sleeping on my foot . i ll shower in a few minutes .","244636":"i hope this turns out as a gif , my computer is funny with gifs .","244637":"i always think that if i went back in time , i would not join a certain site that brought me much distress , but i met my lover on there , so i could not simply never go on it . i regret sharing information that was too personal , and letting people take advantage of my kindness . i probably should have asked for therapy sooner , but it really is not my fault that i was showing signs of mental illness and my parents did nothing about it . they have always been blind to my well being . i wish i saved my stories on documents , because at least then i would still have them , but i lost everything i had years ago , aside from one story . i wish i did more to maintain contact with my best friend . i also wish i did something about my compulsions sooner .","244638":"it depends on the app site . in certain places i never even check my notifications for fear of someone saying something mean to me because i m so conflict avoidant . on here i block obnoxious people whose polls i hate seeing , but it does nothing , so i guess there is no point . on social media platforms as a whole , i generally block people who argue with me because i have no time for that .","244639":"it s not really an age thing , anyone can be attached to their abuser . this is why married women who are abused by their husbands do not get a divorce immediately . they hope that something will change , i suppose . a lot of it stems from behavioral conditioning during one s childhood . like if you hear if a boy is mean to you , it means he likes you all the time , you begin thinking that abuse love .","244640":"so , you attract mean people either way . but they will either harass you or try to befriend you . and then despite befriending you they will harass you behind your back , because they hate everyone , especially themselves . and someone who resembles them in the slightest would thus be hated . even those who are very different from them , because they only wish they could be nice . the world is run by envy .","244641":"yes . not horoscopes , though . people seem to misunderstand and think zodiac signs and horoscopes are the same thing . they also only know of their sun sign , and thus think it is inaccurate solely based on that information , when there are many other signs in your birth chart . i personally find it useful regarding self understanding and growth . another thing i find foolish is when someone bashes another person for believing in zodiac signs . it s like attacking someone for their religious beliefs . why not just allow people to be happy about what they believe in ? just because they fail to do research on the rest of their birth chart does not mean zodiac signs are inaccurate by default . uneducated people will always make ignorant statements .","244642":"eh , there s no reason not to trust anyone , though . not everyone is out to betray you or treat you differently . i try to treat everyone equally , at least , unless they ve wronged me somehow . there are double standards all over the place , and people with an inferiority complex will always try to treat you as inferior , because they project . it is important to avoid people who project .","244643":"uh , yeah , me getting in trouble for using shotacon pictures on another site meanwhile guys used lolicon pictures all over the place and got away with it , but when it came to me it was suddenly breaking the rules . when a guy does something it s fine but when it comes to a girl it s unacceptable . those guys used very suggestive pictures while mine were nothing in comparison .","244644":"i eat ramen between pm and around pm every saturday while watching a certain show for now it is big time rush . i translate french from pm to around

like words and patterns . ever since i started hallucinating , my writing has shifted toward being metaphorical , because there is a connection between hallucinations delusions and a metaphorical way

should take pride in their loneliness , as it proves they can feel normal human emotions . it is only natural to be bothered by a lack of companionship . i m not the type who seeks friends and such .","244650":"when i was about or , i started reading fanfictions , and not knowing what plagiarism was back then , i copied someone s fanfiction . they understandably got mad at me , and even removed their fanfiction from the site entirely . i apologized to them . it was not copied word for word , however , and i turned it into my own story about demons and people who lived in a house together in the middle of a forest . i ended up writing over , chapters of it in total they were not very long , but years later the writing site i used went down without any prior warning , so i lost everything . i was interested in supernatural things , i guess . i always forget that i originally started off writing fanfictions . i only write original works characters nowadays .","244651":"maybe he had a

school dance via a letter of sorts , but i threw it away without even reading it . he cried during class that day . it was kind of funny .","244652":"yeah , i think guys and maybe girls mistake

time . i do not understand this mindset of if someone s nice mean to me , it means they like me , i guess . i think you ll find someone when the time is right .","244653":"yes , i write about characters who are primarily based off of me , so my inspiration aside from my lover has a lot to do with my own emotions . my characters feel whatever i feel that day , you know . what is your screenplay about ? i m not good at planning ahead for my writing , it s very spontaneous , which is why i get stuck all the time . i hate when people go just brainstorm to get rid of writer s block when not everyone enjoys brainstorming . everyone works differently . pages is still a good amount , though !","244654":"typing tests suck , i get anywhere from about wpm wpm because they use a bunch of numbers , quotation marks , etc . i started using the internet at a young age , so i learned to type quickly . i m sure you ll finish it if you dedicate time to it , though it can be hard to find time . not to mention writer s block exists . i ve been writing a story since and i m only on chapter , so i feel you . talent isn t wasted unless you waste it , in my opinion .","244655":"i love this picture .","244656":"here is a statement i wrote yesterday that sums up my thoughts . i definitely support the black lives matter movement , and i think everyone is protesting for a good cause that being the unnecessary murders of minorities . but i also think people are using the protest as an excuse to wreak havoc and steal from stores start fires . . . in other words , a breeding ground for criminal activity . i do not really support stealing from large businesses , even if everything may be insured , and i especially do not support stealing from small businesses that would be in much greater jeopardy . the stores are just scapegoats for everyone s anger . and while i understand the mentality behind them , and this whole riots are effective belief , i do not support crimes as a whole , both perpetrated by police and civilians . i imagine that people feel they must resort to violence because the police are gassing them , shooting them with rubber bullets , etc . , all acts which cannot be justified if groups were peacefully protesting there is evidence to prove the protests were truly peaceful before the police came along and started further accentuating that they are brutal and abuse their power . i am not in favor of the all cops are bad acab statement because i believe generalizations are harmful , even if they may be used to get a point across , like in this case . and i find that there is an abundance of twisted logic , like individuals suggesting that white people are all racist to varying degrees , or cops are all racist by default simply for being in the police force . it is like stating that if you work at chick fil a , you are homophobic , because chick fil a supports homophobic organizations . where you work what your job is does not necessarily reflect your own values and beliefs . your job does not represent who you are and what you stand for . you are just trying to make money . now , do not get me wrong , i do think that the police instigating violence by running over protesters and shooting them blind with rubber bullets are part of the problem . but being part of a certain system organization job is not an indicator of your character , and it is wrong to criticize an entire group rather than the ones inflicting harm . it is like punishing the entire class of students when only a handful were acting up . racism and other things work the same way . why treat all blacks like they are threats , or all police like they are threats ? this is why i believe both mentalities are dangerous .","244657":"based on the chart you gave me , this individual is very sensitive and empathetic due to their moon being in cancer . they prefer balance and dislike conflicts , and may act as a mediator in life . their sun is not balanced with uranus they are eccentric and socially unconventional . they may act impulsively and prioritize their own needs . their sun is also discordant with neptune , meaning they have a tendency to be slothful and lack willpower . because they strive for peace , they may be indecisive and slow to respond to stressful situations . they are easily upset taken advantage of because they trust others and have a strong sense of compassion . their venus is in harmony with other planets , meaning they are very passionate in love and commit themselves wholeheartedly to a relationship . they are helpful and attractive , but could use their charm as a manipulation tactic . they are imaginative and believe in soulmates . they are idealistic and thus may be disappointed when their partner does not live up to their expectations . their jupiter has a negative influence on uranus and neptune they can be too impractical , irresolute , emotional , sentimental , and close minded . they may focus on many things at once and thus never get anything accomplished . they are independent , determined , and creative , but can be unrealistically ambitious . their uranus is in harmony with pluto , thus they care about reforming society and engaging in charitable acts . they are fair and compromising . because jupiter is in harmony with saturn , they can indeed balance ideals practicality , if they work toward it . they are reliable , persistent , and a good friend . they sincerely care about the feelings of others . they are sensitive to criticism , and have a strong sense of intuition . others may admire them for their emotional depth . they enjoy pleasing and nurturing others . you could think of them as a gentle parental figure . because their venus is in virgo , they are perhaps shy and hesitant to express affection . they desire mutual trust in a relationship and can be a great listener . they are an observant perfectionist who likes order . considering their mercury is in scorpio , they dislike superficiality and can easily see through others . their mars in scorpio causes them to be very competitive and prepared for challenges . they are the type to appear calm on the outside but struggle with intense emotions on the inside . with their pluto in scorpio , they likely have a fascination with sexual taboos death , perhaps wanting to learn more about various crimes . their jupiter in libra may bring good fortune and success in life . they love to learn , and favor things that are aesthetically pleasing . their saturn is in aquarius , thus they may enjoy scientific information . they struggle to let go of their problems due to their inability to be open about their unpleasant emotions . they might feel that no one understands them , and that they are too different to fit in and be accepted .","244658":"the mixture of uranus and neptune brings a sense of spirituality to your life you are not afraid of the unknown , and instead seek to learn more about it . you may take an interest in conspiracy theories , the occult , etc . after looking at your chart , it seems the combination of jupiter and saturn will be detrimental to your life , in that you may lose passion and become depressed over a chronic boredom . you may try to alleviate this boredom with material goods , thinking it will solve your problems . you will criticize yourself for not achieving certain goals . it is important to lower your standards for yourself at times and not be too unrealistic or harsh . most of your planets are balanced with each other and will not create discord in your life . for instance , mars is in harmony with jupiter , meaning you will maintain enthusiasm and vitality , and physical endeavors will greatly fulfill you . the th house is all about death , mystery , and dealing with life struggles . venus in the th house means there is a sense of death macabre mixed in your relationships . as i stated earlier , this could mean one of your loved ones will die . but it could also mean that you can learn to cope with trauma pain through your relationship . you may also be forced to let a past part of yourself die for the sake of keeping your relationship afloat . this is , after all , the house of rebirth , meaning you will have to change and let go of things from your past . you might be controlling in a relationship and develop unhealthy habits such as manipulation , which you will have to relinquish . you will need to focus on bettering yourself as a person if you want a healthy relationship , is essentially what the combination of saturn venus in house suggests . your mercury is in harmony with uranus , meaning you enjoy intellectual stimulation and focusing on many projects at once , rather than limiting yourself to only one . you are interested in scientific knowledge and modern technology , and you dislike a slow paced environment . your sun in aries and mars in leo combine in a positive way , making you confident , ambitious , and optimistic . your pluto negatively impacts venus , causing you to be jealous and overly possessive in relationships . your anger can be explosive , and you are likely to hurt your partners with your painful words , if you are not careful . you should certainly focus on what you can do to prevent toxic displays of emotion from letting loose . remember , saturn is all about self improvement and preventing yourself from harming your relationship through psychological abuse . because both neptune and uranus are in harmony with pluto , however , you have the ability to make a positive impact on society and change your environment for the better . you like to be of service to others , and it is important to apply this same energy in your relationships , in which you are kind to your lovers and not too controlling .","244659":"if your th house is empty , relationships might not be very troublesome , and you do not require them to be happy . it is natural to have at least one or two empty houses . this means there is no single sign that affects the house however , the th house holds some influence over it . venus in pisces is quite a contrast to your moon sun in aries in that you are sensitive and emotional towards love sex . it is a highly intuitive experience , and given that it is in your th house , you might experience death related to a relationship partner , or a loss of some sort . you likely will become wealthy through some means . you prioritize money and could find yourself shopping excessively . you are passionate about romance and like to give gifts to your partners . because of this interest in obtaining money , you could be seen as superficial and greedy . you might even find yourself in a relationship with someone solely for their wealth . you like uncovering mysteries and learning your partners secrets . you possess intense sexual energy and desire commitment from others . you will be passionate in love , but do not need it , if that makes sense ?","244660":"i am an aries moon . someone with their moon in aries experiences a lot of anger , and will be ambitious and full of energy . this coupled with an aries sun creates an individual who enjoys confrontation and arguments . there is a sense of passion and intensity in life , and also maybe aggression . there is also a desire to compete with others . because the moon sign is all about your emotions , you may feel impatient , impulsive , and easily irritated . you may walk quickly and not think before you speak . you focus on physical activities , such as different sports . you are spontaneous and always seeking thrill . your sun sign is about your ego and how you perceive yourself , so you may think you are exciting and adventurous . your rising sign is about how other people see you , and the first impression you make on them . leos are seen as confident and kind of pretentious . you come off as powerful , authoritative , and charming . you seem to not accept criticism and only talk to those who agree with you . you are optimistic and outgoing , and people might see you as extroverted and a bit domineering . you have a compelling vibe and seem confident on the surface . your aries moon likely brings confidence , too . you are perceived as a leader who likes to be in control of things . you can be dramatic at times , and good at acting . you enjoy your independence and expressing yourself to others . you are capable , responsible , and hardworking . you are also blunt and honest . you are assertive and feel strongly about your opinions . others might be overwhelmed by your passion for life . you could find it difficult to apologize and back down from a fight , leading others to believe you are insensitive . but you are brave and not easily scared or intimidated . you are action oriented and take pride in your achievements . you prefer not to dwell on things you are perhaps not very secretive or sad . you love new experiences and hate routine and repetition . you are enthusiastic , but you might struggle with feelings of wrath or envy . you try your best , because you feel success is important . your venus sign tells about how you behave in a relationship , if you re interested . sorry if my response wasn t the best !","244661":"i cannot sleep if there are sounds around me . my sibling always talks to a friend on the phone at night , so i use a white noise machine that drowns out the sound , and it allows me to sleep . if i ever had trouble sleeping at night in the past , i played a certain audio of music specifically made to help you sleep better . most of them do not work , but that one did .","244662":". . blue . . no . any memory of being with my

forgetting that i went outside to see a doctor because my ear was ringing and i could not hear out of it well ! it was maybe two weeks ago . i cannot keep track of time . before that i went out to get food from burger king , as i mentioned in another post . and then weeks ? before that i went to sonic . so i ve been out three times . i d rather stay inside every day , though . i got ear drops but they haven t been working . i ve had constant ear ringing since a year or two ago , but it s been quiet . my left ear is ringing loudly these days and i just want it to be quiet like the right one .","244665":"i will not even begin to act like i know how to end it . but i think fixing our health system is a start . even spending a few days in the hospital after giving birth can amount to over , without insurance , as i saw from a teacher s actual post pregnancy hospital bill . it is easy to go into major debt . medicine can cost thousands of dollars without insurance , as well . i assure you that a month s worth of medicine did not cost , to produce , so why does it cost that much to buy it ? many people do not even make that much money in a single year of working .","244666":"yes . i think it is a miracle that i was able to fall in love with someone me , who felt no sympathy or care for anyone and that i was loved in return . it is miraculous that i finally gained essential emotions , and that i could connect with other things . and it is a miracle to go from strangling myself , trying to hang myself for years , to where i am at now , in harmony with the world . . . for the most part .","244667":"repost to fix an error at first i thought you were asking if native americans from mexico are the same as indians from india , and the answer is no . . . but mexicans and indians are not the same , either . mexicans are a very diverse group of people sharing the genetic makeup of pre columbian groups such as mayans and native americans . other mexicans are mestizos , and many are of a european descent . many indians have the genetic makeup of middle easterners due to an ancient migration . indians primarily genetically resemble other south asian groups , but there

, i understand how it feels . but to me it makes little sense to be suicidal over something you have control over . rather than complaining about making mistakes , make better choices to redeem yourself . instead of calling yourself a terrible person and such , maybe work on becoming a better person . it is only natural to be suicidal over unpleasant things one has no control over , but you

beach multiple times . on one occasion , one of my sisters had her friend come with us . i went out to sea with them and the waves dragged us far away from the sand . we could not swim back to shore

we destroy and torture out of greed i wish i could give you something else i wish i could give you something else","244680":"i am not attracted to females but i am in a relationship with one . it is what you call going gay for someone . i think if you truly love someone as a person , you can overlook their sex . i find it superficial to not be with someone solely because you are not gay . it is not me being in denial , i am simply not attracted to females . if i were , it would make no sense to deny that rather than deny my taboo attraction that is frowned upon . considering i am open about that , if i were attracted to my own sex , i would also be open about that .","244681":"i think it depends on who you ask . writing can be literal or figurative , and poetry is a form of writing . poetry could mimic song lyrics and have a certain beat . music can be literal or figurative , as well . art can be abstract or realistic . music often requires different instruments , much like painting requires different tools . with writing you just need a pen pencil and paper , or a computer keyboard and document . writing a novel or something is more like music in the sense that they generally both involve words , and writing song lyrics is of course a form of writing . i guess they coincide . paintings are about the image , songs tend to be about the emotion , and writing is often a mixture of both . i would say it is more like music , though .","244682":"habit ? i do not really have habits but rather compulsions , like constantly checking that my phone is in my bag ,

stall so i can avoid it i think some girls use period blood as self expression , and so on . i used to have the compulsion of watching at least anime episodes a day . i became anxious whenever i watched any less than that . i did not really have obsessive thoughts like if i do not watch episodes then my family will die or anything . these days i have many obsessive thoughts , however . not the one mentioned , that is just a common example people use . in the past it was compulsions and no obsessive thoughts but now i have both .","244683":"repost because i forgot something favorite

coming up with ritemo and shenzo , they are good names .","244686":"you should not measure your worth and beauty based on whether you are dating someone or not . i believe love only comes when necessary , and when you are not searching for it . people are also inherently drawn to someone who is hopeful and optimistic . but well , i have trouble understanding in this regard because i was never interested in being in a relationship , it simply happened . this is why i believe it is best to wait , if you are someone who desires a relationship . good things come to those who wait , after all . unless you are a bad person , then karma will eventually beat you .","244687":"chips because i cannot live without them on my sandwich and i think their presence there represents how no one wants me on their sandwich who knows what this means metaphorically but i want me there . the fact that people eat soft , squishy sandwiches instead of putting chips on them amazes me because it is so disgusting . i have yet to meet someone else who puts them on their sandwiches even though it is superior .","244688":"the only thing that works is resolving the problem at hand . if that is impossible in the sense that you have no control over it then all you can do is alter your perceptions by focusing on more favorable aspects of life . look at the smaller things that make you happy . herons make me happy , and eating spicy ramen every saturday , for instance . things could always inevitably be worse , and it is good to keep that fact in mind . i was suicidal for years and even had to go to a mental hospital but i feel great nowadays , you know , and i ve grown to the point where even major things do not disrupt the peace . there is always light at the end of the tunnel , even if there remain obstructions obscuring it from view . what i ve learned is that you need to appreciate little things more , like plants or birds . distracting yourself from your sadness is not beneficial nor does it accomplish anything . i think all you can do is prevent yourself from getting sad in the first place . it is understandable to be sad in response to certain things , such as the death of a family member , but even then things could be worse . what if two family members had died , rather than one ? i think every bad incident is a lesson and sadness leads to growth . even if a plant wilts , it can always thrive again . certain plants end up dying , but if you are the wilting plant , all you can do is provide yourself with the proper care needed to prosper . the best care is achieved through meeting your own emotional physical needs . anyway , i m rambling too much . just ask why am i sad ? what can i do about this feeling ? if there is something that can be done , you need to do it . do not wait before things worsen . if nothing can be done , all you can do is change your internal dialogue and think positive affirmations , as well as focusing on more pleasant things . feeling sad for no reason ? think again . there is always a reason .","244689":"i was obsessed with big time rush when i was younger and a boy from my sociology class mentioned watching the entire show a week or two ago , so i thought to look it up again . the band and show bring so much joy to my life again and i feel very pleasant these days . it further reinforces my philosophy that joyous experiences should not be left behind but rather brought back . did a particular show make you happy as a child ? watch it again . was it a game ? immerse yourself in the game once more . do not leave your happiness behind . relive whatever made you happy in the past so long as it is not unhealthy .","244690":"it depends on the severity of the autism . some autistic people are highly dysfunctional . in any case , such crazy parents focus on the rare severe allergic reactions to vaccines rather than understanding that they help the majority of people moreover , the vaccines cause autism belief stems from an old article without conclusive evidence behind it , so they care more about their convictions than data and logic . it isn t bad to be autistic , but i think they are referring to more extreme cases . i think these parents have a fetish for endangering and possibly killing their own children due to their own passion for ignorance .","244691":"the fact that people have more than one lover sexual partner throughout their lives . it is not true devotion if you give yourself to multiple people , and your feelings were never truly sincere if you can love someone

in monogamy very strongly .","244692":"make them be more stable , but that would require several things . i wish my father would stop drinking and smoking , and drunk driving while i m in the car with

people i would never get into a relationship because it seemed impossible , especially considering that my atttaction to adults has been so limited . i did end up falling in love , however , when i felt truly understood and cared for . finally someone accepted me as a person . i suppose i tried suppressing it because i thought my feelings would never be reciprocated . but eventually i did provide a confession of sorts . i ve always found it miraculous that two people traditionally attracted to certain groups could love each other despite the fact that we happen to delineate from said

only acceptable if they re a family member , sitting on someone else , writing anything romantic to someone else , suggestively lying down with them , basically doing anything remotely physical or too emotional .","244695":"i understand . i think that you may want to reconsider your career choice if you feel your current stress outweighs any possible gratification from said job in the future . that is , if you feel it isn t worth it to keep going along this route . but if you truly love what you plan to do , then you will be able to overcome any obstactles preventing you from getting there in the meantime . however , it is difficult to know if you will love it until you get there . but it is likely that what you are studying is reflective of the type of material you will be needing when

thing .","244697":"sorry for reposting this answer , it had a few grammatical errors some repetition that i wanted to fix . it s alright , thank you for listening and being willing to learn more . it s very hypocritical of the gay community to go on about how they can t help who they re sexually attracted to but then they turn around and discriminate against pedophiles hebephiles ephebophiles for the exact same thing . you would think they would be understanding when really they treat others with the same contempt . not every person who is attracted to children intends to offend in any way , as not everyone has low self control , which society seems to assume . most people who are attracted to children are also not exclusively attracted to them in fact , only a small percentage are . this means they can be attracted to adults and have families . and no , that does not inevitably mean they are attracted to their own children . if you would not be sexually attracted to your own sibling , why would they be attracted to their own child ? they re people like anyone else . it is a myth that they were all sexually abused . certain maps minor attracted persons just had an early puberty , and i do believe there is a correlation there . they tend to also be distressed by their attraction who would not be distressed if society condemns them and wants them to be tortured and killed for something they did not choose ? some of them go on to commit suicide . in general they suffer in silence because they have no choice . they have no parades as homosexuals do . i do not believe i know of any who do not have some sort of mental illness schizophrenia , autism , and bipolar disorder are common . immense guilt can actually trigger hallucinations and the onset of schizophrenia . people have this odd belief that therapy will cure them , but just as it cannot cure someone who is gay , it cannot cure someone who is attracted to children . most maps realize they are attracted to children when they are between the ages of . women may also be maps , but people assume only men can be maps , likely because they associate an attraction to minors with sexual violence , and men are more commonly perceived as violent . if you want more information , there are research articles available online . or you can ask me something and i ll reply .","244698":"all you hear is people being ignorant , but it does not take much to actually look into something . if you did , you would learn that only about of people who are attracted to children are sex offenders . and ignorant idiots also believe pedophiles are attracted to teens when they are attracted to prepubescent children . hebephiles are attracted to children who are about and ephebophiles are attracted to children who are . ages may vary slightly . but no one cares , they just make foolish generalizations and act like they are correct . it is ignorance and the demonization of these groups that causes them to offend in the first place . naturally if society hates you then you will act out . it is unjustified to hate someone who has not even committed any crime . no one chooses who they are attracted to .","244699":"i think when someone becomes satisfied with their relationship , their feelings are of a more peaceful nature , rather than a very passionate obsessive one . maybe you are mistaking this complacency peace with feeling nothing ? indifference and peace are somewhere on the same spectrum . but if you think this is not the case and you are genuinely feeling nothing , i guess you never truly loved him to begin with , because true love lasts forever and superficial love dies .","244700":"no . i find it foolish to sacrifice your health for the sake of your superhero complex where you delusionally convince yourself you are helping animals and shit . these pathetic people end up not getting the proper nutrients they need and yet they claim their diet is natural , when something that is natural is physically fulfilling , and that is simply not . we have some sharp teeth because we are meant to consume meat , and opposing your biological needs is irrational and quite frankly i believe these people have an eating disorder . you have vitamin deficiencies but your hysterical self wants to believe you are actually helping animals . how funny to ruin your health for the sake of helping animals you are not even helping . your diet is not preventing them from being killed and eaten . you are nothing .","244701":"i m not really sure . i think i am happier now , but more stressed than ever . i m just glad my medicine works . i have left unpleasant people behind . my states are less severe . winter is gone , luckily . and that boy who took my seat at lunch is gone . i do not have to deal with certain classes anymore . i feel less paranoid about bugs outside . i am less angry .","244702":"i love horror movies , but i find jump scares to be predictable and cheap unfortunately producers have a tendency to rely on them as a means of providing their intended effect . movies in general should set a better atmosphere , and i wish they were more abstract and interpretative . i love figurative works , but many movies are very direct and in your face . to me , there is little point in watching something unless it really makes you think . not to suggest i only watch very thoughtful movies , but i think they are far more interesting . something atmospheric and beautiful like nekromantik or tommy .","244703":"i really want one of those loot crates that come in the mail every month , but i do not have any money for it . dresses i like can be rather expensive . the things i want are generally around , i d say , so not too expensive . i want to collect anime figures , but they tend to be very expensive and i do not have the money . my family is rather broke and i do not personally have a job because i have no time for it and i have too many physical problems to work cannot stand for more than like minutes without back pain because i have low vitamin d , but vitamin d supplements are not helping me . . . i have neck pain , wrist problems , always pain in the most random parts , etc . . i do not come from a background of wealth .","244704":"relatively quiet , aside from when people decide to throw a party . no crime here . the houses kind of look the same . the neighbors are nasty bitches , and the people who run the neighborhood have ridiculous rules , such as how you are not allowed to paint your mailbox a different color . the people who own the neighborhood also threatened us for having a car on the road in front of the house , even though many other people also have cars there and they are not threatened , so .","244705":"i try to focus on the major tasks first , and think about the fact that there will be better times where i am less overwhelmed , and for now i just need to do what i must . i think it helps to think about each thing individually instead of how many things you have to do as a whole . the big picture can be overwhelming to look at , so it is better to look at small sections of that picture .","244706":"there are of course some bad scorpios out there . but one thing that is misinterpeted is their manipulation . it does not come from a place of ill will . scorpios are very private people , not because they are trying to hide things but because they feel as if they would be misunderstood if they spoke about themselves , anyway . people also mistakenly associate secrets with lying , but scorpios are very honest and blunt people .","244707":"i m glad !","244708":"i mean , i understand if they cannot afford a therapist and they are trying to reach out to someone , but many of them just want attention , sadly . validation that it s okay to feel as they do and they re so amazing and a great person . they love being fed those superficial words and delusions . like we understand you re depressed , you don t need to make it a personality trait and remind everyone all the time . it gets old .","244709":". i collect feathers . . i have a photographic memory . . i always have lucid dreams . . i ve been writing stories since . . i like doing research on illegal drugs i am opposed to drug use and like to be informed . . i have three cats . . i am schizoaffective and have ocd . . my favorite food is spaghetti . . my favorite animals are squirrels and rabbits . . i ve helped people out of suicide . . i have a very figurative way of seeing things . . i have constant ear ringing tinnitus . . i eat spicy ramen and watch the bates motel every saturday . . i have problems with short term memory but can recall things from long ago kind of counteracts my photographic memory . . i ve been in a relationship since late . . i have several paraphilias . . lil xan is my second favorite real person in the world . . lastly , gaku yashiro is my husband .","244710":"many things are unhealthy but do not apply to me . as for the things that do , well , it is just obvious they are unhealthy , like self harm and such which i did not do , prior to , really . i think my porn addiction was unhealthy , not because it warped my perception of sex or anything , but because i was very desensitized to hardcore genres and always needed to find something even more extreme , like videos of people being killed and their body parts cut off , or animals being injured . i was always watching eel porn , defecation porn , etc . all i thought about was watching porn . i had difficulty focusing on things due to my fantasies . i still watch porn , of course , but generally milder forms , and i do not spend nearly as much time on it as i used to . as well , certain fantasies were distressing , but i learned to get rid of them . i was aware my hallucinations , delusions , and derealization depersonalization were all unhealthy , which certainly makes me more self aware than other schizophrenics . thus i requested to be put on medicine , which i am still on . i think what is most harmful is the denial of the true self . initially i was in denial about my attraction , for instance , but quickly grew to accept it . denial does not make things go away . some people have this notion that it will just go away over time . but i have consciously been aware of such feelings since early . there is no cure , and you cannot choose for it to go away , just as you never chose to have it . apart from self denial , the most unhealthy things in the world , to me , are assumptions and ignorance . they are absolutely everywhere , unfortunately .","244711":"it depends . i generally refrain from discussing certain things that bother me . i do not wish to embarrass myself by speaking on something i was not asked about in real life , i mean . sometimes i feel ambitious enough to share my views on things and actually speak up for once , but most of the time i do not bother because nothing comes of it , anyway . i am bothered by many things , but no one wants to hear the long list of irritants , so i do not really talk about them . you of course know of all the things that bother me , but generally if i am not asked about my opinion on something , i am not compelled to share it . one thing i find very annoying is when someone goes on and on about the things that bother them when no one fucking asked . it is one thing to write of your likes and dislikes in their respective place , and another to spew your thoughts wherever you go . there is a time and place for everything , and if it is not the correct time and place , i am not interested in discussing what bothers me . but if asked , sure , i would be very outspoken i have no qualms about sharing such things if asked .","244712":"yes , tremendously so . last year my feelings of empathy and care had just started developing , really , but at this point i have gotten used to them . last year i was incredibly unstable and suicidal , and my moods were unpredictable and very intense . this is as opposed to , when i suppressed how i felt , did not harbor feelings of empathy or care , and was essentially robotic and highly derealized . i started feeling more attached to my surroundings in , but i was very scattered and disoriented as a person . as of i am gradually becoming more peaceful and composed without constantly suppressing myself . i was suppressing my anger in , and frequently had homicidal thoughts . i found ways of dealing with this anger in that did not involve homicide or injuring anyone anything without their consent . now in i do not feel very angry at all but i remain easily irritated by people who choose to be ignorant and incorrect , as i am compelled to correct everything . it is not as hard to deal with my emotions , and though i have days in which i despair again , they are not as common or intense as they used to be . i am not as interested in others lives at the moment because i am still working on straightening out my own . i am not that cruel and very devious person that people likely still believe me to be . it is not my problem if you are still obsessing over the past me , but hey , at least i ve always been honest about myself . i still have the same interests as always , but in the span of a couple of years i ve gone from an immoral porn addict to a very lawful and moral person who just has a high libido . not a porn addict anymore as stated , i am still interested in the same things , sexually speaking , but i am just paying less attention to them . in the past i planned to commit a crime and go to jail , but now i am not interested in such a thing . if i was , i would continue to state such i have always been open about things i wish to do in the future . i am not a danger to society anymore , as some would suggest . i am more interested in collecting bird feathers and smiling over the rabbit plushie hanging on my doorknob and watching cat videos all the time than i am in indulging in anything criminal or wrong . now i am just someone who cries over videos of physically injured animals , cries when they hear that a stranger died . i am only human now . my innocence is just more prominent than my deviance these days . i still have many paraphilias , and the same taboo attraction i ve had for years , which others condemn me for . but i do not spend time fantasizing about things as i used to . i just want to write , take care of my plants , read about astrology , drugs , and disorders . these days i am thinking about the numerous animals i want to have in the future , not how i want to torture and kill someone someday . and that is all there is to it . i am a better person now , whether anyone wants to accept that or not . yaoi","244713":"i think they refer to any mild crush as them being in love , as they use it even when they know nothing about the person . yes , i think they are too quick to form a concrete opinion based on a single bad experience . i wouldn t quite call my relationship an online relationship because we ve spent months together in person , but it is long distance and we talk primarily online . i think online dating also depends a lot on trust and faith in the other person , that they would not hook up with someone in real life while being with you online . because certain people rely heavily on the physical aspect of a relationship and could never go months or even years without touching their significant other . you need to have patience and be devoted , otherwise things are bound to fail . but that is all my opinion on the matter other people do not take online relationships seriously and then wonder why a breakup happens . anyway , thanks for the question , and i hope i answered it well enough !","244714":"i agree , and i think people are becoming more and more superficial and materialistic over time . not to mention the rise of casual sex and people spewing the word love so easily and without a second thought to the true meaning and value of the word . i think it is ignorant of people to claim online dating will never work out , just because it did not work out for them personally . experiences are subjective and you cannot assume someone else s experience will be the same as yours . i think whether a relationship works out , online or not , is always dependent on the people within it and certain environmental factors , of course . just do not hook up with someone who will not value you and the relationship to the same extent that you do . i m glad i was one of the people who answered logically , haha . i wish people were more considerate and thoughtful about things . it s just like them saying that true love doesn t exist simply because they had bad experiences . do not project your own experiences on to other people , because they are not the same as you .","244715":"most people are too superficial and impatient for an online relationship to work out . but if you and your significant other are both mature , serious , and patient individuals , then things may work out . the issue is that flippant people jump into a relationship and expect it to work out without putting any effort and care into it . in other words , it s an individual case when it comes to whether online dating will be good for you or not . but i ve been with my lover whom i met online for almost two years now and things are working out fine .","244716":"when i went to the beach and collected dragonfly wings . i am very afraid of bugs , but i m trying to gradually become less afraid of them . i cringed when i got home and had to pull the wings out of a bag because the fear returned , but i m proud of myself for collecting them in the first place . and still having them . yes , the wings were floating in the beach water , alongside many stray seagull feathers which i also took .","244717":"yes , i went to three different elementary schools because we kept moving . i was in one school during kindergarten , and i was often sick , from what i remember . then we moved and i was in another elementary school from st th grade , and moved again where i went to a different elementary school for th grade . however , i only went to one middle school and high school .","244718":"no problem .","244719":"i have not achieved anything and you are the cute one here .","244720":"i only know of your cuteness !","244721":"what do you mean , my memory is just bad , so information gets distorted in my mind .","244722":"i wish . can t even remember something i did a few seconds ago , much less a script . absolutely no french , but japanese someday , yes . i do not have an accent and i cannot speak russian .","244723":"yes ! ! ! lil xan is everything .","244724":"my friends were always very high energy and obsessive about their interests . i have a very particular sense of humor that is kind of hard to understand , but they got it . one of my friends actually barked at people and attacked them . she was goth and a heavy metal fan . my best friend , she liked watching wrestling , and she raved about different youtubers all the time . she always wore black , and her mother was intimidating . she was traditionally weird , in a funny way , while the heavy metal girl was weird in an outcast sort of way . i had another friend who was nothing like those two . she was obsessed with animals and rather feminine , but she was weird , too , in a humorous way . she was always searching for hot guys to obsess over . then there was my friend in rd grade , and she was very sexual and a scorpio like me . unlike me , however , she was interested in the outdoors and actually doing things , and i just wanted to be inside all day and stay on the computer . we grew apart because she and my best friend hated each other and were always fighting over me . there was a girl i was friends with in th grade , and our common interest was anime . but she was extroverted unlike any of my other friends and very clingy . she was very touchy feely and made me feel uncomfortable a lot of the time because i knew she had feelings for me . she was exuberant and lively , but easily irritated . i was stubborn and she was always making me do things i did not want to do . i m not quite sure which trait all of my friends shared , because they were generally different from each other . i got along with masculine girls with dark interests and feminine girls who were very lively , i d say . i just prefer to become friends with someone who is not judgmental , and who understands my energy .","244725":"um , i do not think they are on my phone . cute .","244726":"when i was in th grade , my teacher was always annoyed by me reading books all the time , and it also annoyed her how i always had my hair down . so on the last day of school , she made some students braid my hair . i hated it , and when i went home , it was all tangled and i had to rip my hair out . the thought of braiding my hair does not sound very promising now .","244727":"just giving things some thought .","244728":"uh .","244729":"i swear i did . i don t know .","244730":"i think they should do away with the mindset of the more stressful the classes , the better you are as a student . they act as if you are more competent by default if you take difficult classes that will inevitably make you overwhelmed and ill . it isn t preparing people for the future , it is driving them unstable before they are given the
