   Do you like lakorns? Girls are treated really bad in them.There's lots of violence, there are rape scenes too. This is not only in Thailand, but also around the world. Even kids can watch it on the TV. Do you find it acceptable or do you think they should be banned?

  I haven't said anything because I have my own thoughts about it and right now our fandom is not the fandom we have worked hard to spread so much love, hope, and positive in. To the dauren shippers - I appreciate those who understand its just a sister thing. For those who are commenting rude things like ""laurens crying in the corner"" and other stuff just stop right now and please go somewhere. I think you guys have forgotten about the video Dani posted awhile back. The one were she was crying and just so broken. The one were she said she couldn't even log onto social media anymore wirhout seeing the hurtful comments and messages about her. I think we tend to forget that any one who is in a position like we are, are still human. We still had the same life as everyone, we all have feelings. I grew up as a sister to her, for 19 years Danielle has been in my life. I seen her at her at her lowest points, the worst times and through so much. I think we forgot Danielle is one of the most precious souls to walk on this earth. We grew up in the spotlight so we couldn't be actually kids and say whatever and do whatever without getting hate for it. She's not a kid anymore, but a 19 year old who is legal, can make her own choices and decide what benefits her. Four years ago, she was with a member of a ""man band"" she really cared about him, he hurt her pretty badly she broke down in tears while performing before octobers gone. Same thing happened two years later with a different guy but in the same way. Then the hate from everyone who always says she's annoying, to skinny, etc. Got to her. Emmyn came into her life at a period where she needed him the most. And I can tell that is true love. She has helped him just as much as he has helped her. And I never have seen happier and glowing. So sorry I haven't  said anything on any posts or whatever. Right now there's just so much hate and that going on that is not needed. Spread love and positivity. Be kind to those whom you do not know and let them be happy. #weloveyoudanicimorelli

  They're coins. That you can give to friends or collect and save for yourself.

   Do you think that rather than advanced science and mathematics, schools should teach more practical skills such as cooking, cleaning, managing finances, first aid, etc.? Why/Why not?
  ","
  I do believe so because most children are not taught the basic fundamentals of life and lack basically needs because they were never taught how to cook or manage money. And some families struggle in life so they don't have the knowledge or money to make a meal to eat. And sadly alot of I'll say 16 because you can getaway from family and live on your own but you have specific guidelines that come into play. Lack the knowledge to cook,clean properly because they live and are cared for by adults until the parents decide to dump them on their own
  "

  IT’S OUR BIRTHDAY!!!!! We turn 29 and 21 today!!!!!!! I say this every year but Lauren is the best birthday present I ever got! I am so grateful for her. She’s a phenomenal human being. The world is honestly a better place because of Lauren! I’m super super excited to be turning 29 and getting so close to 30! I have REALLY enjoyed getting older and growing in my life and although 28 was one of the most painful years of my life, it was also the year I grew the most mentally and emotionally in my entire life. I am truly a different person than I was last year in the best way. I am so grateful for the opportunity to grow and change every day. Here’s to the last year of my twenties!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉

  I'm laughing at the fact marian wishes christina a happy birthday  but ignores the fact to wish me. When we used to be best friends, I went to prom with her, I bought her to vidcon with us and everything 😂 so honestly I'm glad I no longer consider her a friend. Have fun with hudson you clout chasers 😂

   Are you a songwriter aren't you?
So could you tell me how do you find inspiration to write a song?
Going for a walk?
Take a coffee?
Listening to songs?
Talking to your friends?
  ","
  Alot of my songs come based on how I felt during a certain time and my experiences. I normally write when I'm upset or hurt. Pressure was about being frustrated and stressed out feeling I needed to level up to what everyone else expected and I was killing myself trying to be ""perfect""

  &@lauren!!!!!! 🎂❤️🥳 you two are so different but so similar. Passionate, driven, uptight HAHA but both have the same amount of weird outbursts 2-3 times a year, smart, fierce, protective of others, frickin beautiful and both of you are very sneaky ladies!!!! HAHA I’m glad you two get to share this day with each other and I’m so glad I have you both in my life! In very different ways, I wouldn’t be the person I am today without either of you. You both have brought such value and love to my life and I wouldn’t trade you for the world! Love you both so much and hope this year is full of growth, love, peace, meaning, change and FUN!!!

  You can love someone and not be together. They can be your sister, best friend, brother, whatever and you will love them. Same thing for soulmate doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a guy you had feelings for or a girl. Sometimes we have to let those things go even if we know they fit that category. Jack and I decided it was best to remain friends for now. No bad blood or any ounce of hate towards each other. I will always support him. But felt that it wasn't good to remain together when we werent sure what we actually wanted. And I disnt want there to be broken bonds and arguements over someone else who I consider a friend liking him. Guys and girls can be just friends.

  TEN YEARS OF CIMORELLI!!
  
  Wow. I definitely can’t fit into one caption the crazy ups and downs, the emotions, the lessons, and the unforgettable life experiences I have had with these five amazing women I call my sisters. I can’t believe it’s been 10 years since we posted Party In The USA. Little did I know how much things would change! Our journey has been magical, painful, heartbreaking, miraculous, triumphant, meaningful, and especially, life-changing. I wouldn’t trade a second of it.
  
  Thank you, to the members of the Cim Fam, past, present and future, for giving us the incredible privilege of being a part of your life. To know your stories and to forever be changed by them. It’s not just a “job” to be able to make music and videos for you. It’s an honor, and one we will never take lightly.
  
  I’m so grateful, so honored and so HAPPY to celebrate 10 years of Cimorelli!! The best is yet to come 🥳🌟💜✨

  This week with Lauren - 8/4
  
  hey guys so other than your usual anxieties and trying to take on more than you can do, I actually had a great week this week !!! had a pretty good amount of energy, exercised almost everyday, was very productive! but towards the end of the week I started to lose it lol my brain turned into mush and I couldn’t process anything so here’s what I did: I canceled my Friday afternoon plans. I went for a short run to get all the anxious energy out of me, then I took a shower with the lights off but I lit some candles and listened to my most chill and dead playlist, then I made myself some food, and then took a nap for 40 minutes. Didn’t really go on my phone or do anything that would take up mental energy for a whole like 2 hours and was able actually really reset my mind and body and then went out and had a great night 🥳 some quick points: 1. i don’t know where that 4th pic came from I think in my friend group chat we were all sending selfies lol 2. Thank you for getting my EP #ORANGE to a million streams!!!!!? 🧡🧡🧡🍊🍊🍊 3. I like to stand on my chair during band meetings sometimes. I think it makes me feel powerful lol 4. This was the beginning of my instagram story on

  A total of 30 something dead in a week and 50 something injured. But heard two people passed away from I believe the el paso one that were being treated for injuries at the hospital. Its really heartbreaking and sad I feel like this is only going to get worse over time, it seems like we are stuck back in the past when we had the shootings at the atlanta night club, christina dying , and the bombs in manchester. Our country needs to do something and sadly our president doesnt want to do anything but split up families when there's bigger problems going on in the world

  Deep down we are still going to be the person we once were. But everyday we learn, we do something new, we change our appearance. But at Miley says ""you can change your hair, you can change your clothes, you can change change your mind its just the way it goes, you can say goodbye or you can say hello, but you'll always find your way back home"". Meaning yes we change, yes we grow but part of us is still that small person we grew up to be

  ""I’ve been writing these songs since I was seventeen. They are the result of heartbreaks and anxiety and mistakes. They’re also the result of magic and excitement and of taking risks. They came from me sitting in my bedroom making something up on my laptop and wondering if it would be good enough to be a song. When I listen to all of these songs together, I get a distinct feeling. A feeling of nostalgia and excitement. A feeling of pain and disappointment. A bit of a bittersweet feeling. Sometimes I see feelings as colors, and this feeling is the color Orange. 🍊

  Honestly don't believe everything you hear!! It hurts people. No one knows the full story. We only know one side of it. And that's Kays side. And lets be honest she's in the wrong for posting it on social media for the world to see when it couldve been resolved in private between them. Zach cant tell his side because of the management rules. We just need to let them be to figure this all out.  My prayers go out to them and hopefully it gets worked out.

  Trump is to worried about building a wall with a barrier high enough so people cant climb over it. But it doesnt stop the fact that the other countries can build stairs on their side, will try to fly or go around the barrier in water. Or the tunnel that connects the borderd together. .. Theres still terroist in the country or people that are working here in the usa for them or are associate. Our gun control could be stricker then it is but he's not focusing on it. But yet we have I.C.E officers in every state trying to get rid of ""ILLEGALS"" that literally know their rights and can refuse any form of communication with the officers unless theres a legal documentation saying they have to be removed.  And then locking innocent children from other countries into cages and letting them die in the camps ... But yet fails to recognize the actual danger in our country

   Really great lyrics to ""Brown Eyed Boys"" and I find it interesting that you placed the song in a ""sea of sound"". Brave and interesting. How did you decide on what I have called the ""sea of sound""? Were you inspired by any other songs? Hope you do great and keep up the good work! :-) :-) :-)
  ","
  Honestly I just mostly write songs when I'm sad its like healing in a way. And sometimes what I'm feeling can be placed into a song lyric and I normally wrote it down and just base it off that. Like pressure for example, I was feeling like I was dying trying to measure up to everything society expevted. When I looked around I seen people who were in a better mindset then I was. With brown eyed boys well... I don't really want to talk awhole lot about the reasons behind it because there's two reasons. And with the track and the way the beat and instrumentals are I like different, but catchy. I like making it sound fun and happy even though the lyrics are sad.

  ""I'm shattered
  
  Please let me see that way
  
  I hate the rules, I love the game
  
  I'm so addicted to the pain
  
  I dont wanna be in love , I wanna be in
  
  The eye of the hurricane
  
  Rip me open
  
  Leave me lonely
  
  Find somebody newer than me
  
  I live for the chase and I hate to be safe
  
  I run and I run and I run until I break
  
  A freshly painted door keeps on
  
  Closing in my face
  
  But I'll pick the lock and open up
  
  And disregard the wet paint
  
  Baby come and hold this gun
  
  Yeah, don't you want to be in love for little
  
  Just for a little?
  
  You're the sea and I'm the moon, yeah
  
  Feel that attraction pulling me to you
  
  Make the currents strong and rough yeah
  
  We don't even have to touch
  
  We could be sweet like mary Sheen
  
  As long as you don't choke on the stem
  
  Come be with me, but look before you leave
  
  Cause sometimes a bomb looks just like a present
  
  Bottle me up but don't take too much
  
  Cause you know that sugar is just poison
  
  So innocent just hold my hand
  
  Take me on a ride through candy land
  
  Ignore me, bored me keep your distance
  
  See her, love her, keep me wishing
  
  You were mine, I'll long for you, I'll dream of you
  
  Thats all I'll do
  
  Hold me, know me, paint me pictures
  
  Say I'm yours, and you don't love her
  
  Tell me I'm not like the others
  
  I'll pretend I believe you, I'll pretend that you will stay
  
  Baby come and hold this gun
  
  Now don't you want to be in love for a little?
  
  Just for a little?
  
  You're the sea and I'm the moon, yeah
  
  Feel that attraction pulling me to you
  
  Make the currents strong and rough, yeah
  
  We don't even have to touch
  
  I know that I'm crazy and I wont stay for long
  
  I just get so scared that you'll
  
  Fall out of love (before I do)
  
  Sometimes I get so anxious I'll overthink to the death
  
  But right now it feels nice to be here
  
  Please keep looking at me like that

  Where to even start? .. Kian and I been best friends since I was like literally a fetus. We met at digi fest and I was like 13 at the time. Kian was apart of O2L and I used to be super shy, shyer than I am today. So I literally wasnt all talky talky. But he wasnt just at digi fest to hang out he was also a performer who also happend to be staying in the same hall as us. At the time I only associated with my sisters, our ex friend ryan beatty, and Andrea russett. As the tour went on we talked more and hung outside just being random.. Came to find out kian and I had a lot of things in common amd eventually we became friends. He was in a video of ours as well and through a banana through the window. In 2015 I was JCS summer crush as I put it and will never forget the day JC ( we were kids at the time) but asked me to marry him (ring pop wedding anybody). Through the years if living in california  we always hung out and just had a good time. He's my best friend till this day, always there for me, supporting me, and loving me. We get a lot of people who want us to be together but I don't think that will ever happend and if it does well hello heaven I guess ahah but hes literally like another brother to me and I'm so glad I met him, just an amazing person to be around and cherish

  Here's the thing if you like someone, ASK THEM OUT ! Not like oh I want to date you now type of stuff but invite them to a movie or to get lunch etc. If they don't hang out with you then they're not interested and you should probably realize that and just move on. Also good things take time to build in order to know if its real or not. So just chat for awhile and get to actually know them as well

  The wars are part of our history and how we gor to the point in life were we are now. Many lives were lost and still continue to be lost. The soldiers that make it alive come home with PTSD and other things that makes them believe they're still there witnessing that thing but they risk their lives to keep our country safe. Violence with kids is awhile different thing. Instead of talking it out now a days kids would rather pull out a weapon and shoot them to death.

  Lol no you take milk and eggs and mix them together like u would for scrambled eggs and you can add cinnamon in with it as well or like fruit etc. The you take a piece of bread that is soft and dip it onto the mixture on both sides. You get your frying pan, melt butter then put the bread in and cook it until its done then top it off with syrup or whatever :) you can also bake it

  So little recap for DAN since he wants to be rude.
  
  I been in the band since I was 8 years old. My parents Lynne is a musician and my dad michael runs his own construction company WHICH is based out of CALIFORNIA. Obviously being only 8 i didn't have an actual job BEFORE hand. But was in school getting an education like the rest of the children were as well. lisa was in college and finished school early. We did do summer jobs (the older girls). But since being in the band we earn our money that way. The merch, the patreon is were we all get money from as well to be able to do yours, meet and greets, release music, videos etc. So o earn my OWN money by WORKING. Something you probably don't know the meaning of anyway.

  - we hugged you,cried with you, and listened to your stories
  
  * AFTER the European tour we REALIZED:
  
  - our number one purpose is to CONNECT with you guys, and to be a source of HOPE and POSITIVITY  in your LIFE.
  
  * in 2015, after 5 YEARS in L.A:
  
  - we decided to LEAVE our RECORD LABEL and move to NASHVILLE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT ARTISTS.
  
  - Moving to nashville was TERRIFYING but also EXCITING
  
  *We were on our OWN for the FIRST TIME
  
  - running a BUSINESS together.
  
  - MAKING MUSIC
  
  - and TRYING to figure it all out.
  
  *we even FILMED a REALITY show called, ""LIFE AS CIMORELLI"" when we moved to nashville! ( you can check it out on youtube )

  - Then we TOURED europe for a SECOND TIME!
  
  It was a CRAZY tour. 17 CITIES IN ONE MONTH!
  
  * we PERFORMED on a girl group COMPETITION show in CHINA!

  In 2017, we came out with OUR PODCAST, "" THE CIMORELLI PODCAST ( You can Watch all of season 1 on youtube.com/cimorellipodcast) and every OTHER episode of season 2 as well! To watch the full season 2 you have to be a member on PATREON.
  
  Let's just say its not your ordinary podcast 😂
  
  - its been a LONG CRAZY journey since we started back in 2007! WE LEARNED ALOT, GROWN ALOT, and we are GRaTEFUL for so much. We are so grateful for you all weather you been here since the beginning,years or just joined the cimfam and found us. YOU are the reason we do what we do!

  * the responses were INSANE. Messages started pouring in. People we're opening up and sharing their deepest darkest secrets with us.
  
  * In 2015, we went on OUR FIRST EUROPEAN TOUR ( CONTINUE)

   Potentially controversial question, what are your thoughts on the ""body positivity"" movement?
  ","
  Every ne ia beautiful in their own ways. Shape, form, smile, hair, eye color etc. And its a sad thing to see so many people discrimize because they're not 6 feet tall, a size zero model, have a face clear of acne and scars,freckles, beauty marks, etc. Because their smile isn't perfectly straight and white as a pearl, because their face isn't perfectly straight without any medical issues or birth effects, or the perfect perky breasts and so on. So I'm kind of glad more modeling agencies and hollywood jobs are giving people with different skin tones, disabilities, body shapes a chance to live out their dreams and spread awareness but there's still so much that can be done

   If you had to choose, would you go to the Light or the Dark side?
  ","
  Okay so if I was playing a role for a TV show where it was like a vampire series or something I think I would want to play the role of the dark side being that in real life I kinda live on the good side and every now amd then its nice to see what the other side is like. Plus I have a love for wearing black clothing so .... I think that would fit in. My sisters and I all had a role in a movie but only Danielle, lisa and amy were seen the most. My character didnt come in until almost the end at the party scene and I didn't really have a important role or something memorable. But they played kinda the mean girl role.

  Out of sight, out of mind
  
  Tell me why you make that so hard
  
  Crash and burn every time
  
  'Cause I always take things too far
  
  I don't want to be helpless
  
  Right when I'm getting so close
  
  That's when you disappear
  
  Lately, I'm feeling reckless
  
  But I don't want to burn out
  
  Guess I gotta hold on tighter
  
  I don't even know what's real now
  
  I wish that I could calm down
  
  But I don't really have a choice
  
  When I'm falling for these brown-eyed boys
  
  Sweeter than the rush I'm getting
  
  Deeper than the pain I'm feeling
  
  Suddenly I'm destroyed
  
  All because of these brown-eyed boys
  
  You're stringing me along you know exactly what to do
  
  I know that you don't want me but I still want you
  
  And every other night when it's late up in my room
  
  I'm looking at the stars, wish I was looking at you
  
  Sunlight just right on your face
  
  Just like a videotape
  
  I just want to rewind
  
  Maybe I'm going insane
  
  I know the end of this game
  
  I lose it every time
  
  I don't even know what's real now
  
  I wish that I could calm down
  
  But I don't really have a choice

  Sweeter than the rush I'm getting
  
  Deeper than the pain I'm feeling
  
  Suddenly I'm destroyed
  
  All because of these brown-eyed boys
  
  Maybe it's masochism
  
  But I don't know any different
  
  Than losing my mind, oh
  
  You're fading further away
  
  But you know I love the chase
  
  I don't think that I should catch you anyway
  
  I don't even know what's real now
  
  I wish that I could calm down
  
  But I don't really have a choice
  
  When I'm falling for these brown-eyed boys

   Is it wrong or natural to not want a nephew cousin uncle etc around? My nephew is driving me up the wall!

  Its considered as jealous by other people but truth is with some family there's favoritism between siblings etc. And the other one gets sorta treated badly while the other sits at the table eating off a golden spoon enjoying a five course meal.

  Moved around. We used to live in el Dorado hills in Sacramento california. A few years later when a manager from the uk daughter found our videos she had her mom call us and arrange a meet up in los angeles. We went there and ended up getting sign to universal island records. Which made us move to Malibu , california. Which lasted until 2015, did many opportunities and neet many awesome people but there was also some bad mixed in and one of those being we were being pressured by the la music industry to become something we will never be and they never really understood us or the message we wanted to create for our fans. So we ended up Splitting away from the label and going independent. We were presented with the opportunity of moving to Tennessee which we all voted for except kath was gone at the time so someone else like called her or something and the vote was in we werr moving away for the place we called home since basically birth. On may 25, 2015 we moved to Tennessee where we have been for four plus years. And this is home now

  PSA: just want to give a huge shoutout to the cimfam members who are trying to get mine and Dani's channel : Daniandlaurencim to 100k in order to collect a silver play button. I'm not sure if we will be rewarded one if this ever happens being that the channel has been inactive for ATLEAST 7 years now. But I do appreciate you guys for trying and subscribing it shows how much we all have come over the years and that channel meant the world the world to me and dani being that we were the youngest and we were trying to show our individual voices as well at the time. Hopefully one day there will be a return of sugar & spice 💛💛💛 (we may or may not have something in the works ) xoxo we love you guys and thank you for everything you guys do to get us to the place we are now and to help up continue on this journey

  No the fact you literally ATTACK a member of the band, insult them and say a hurtful comment towards that said member.

But also continue to act like everything is fine when really its not and sadly you're not a true Roadie at all.

  Can you just take the bands name out of your user completely. They don't hate you. Its what you said to one of the members that is completely rude and unacceptable. For you to even say that towards a boy who is literally one of the sweetest souls that I and anyone else knows. A boy who works nonstop and tries his best to make ALL his fans happy everyday whether he's busy or sick. He still tries his best, and for you to make a rude ___ freaking comment to him just because he Was BUSY and out having time TO HIMSELF for once to be on ask.FM at the moment. God forbid holy hell breaks loose! And since you want to make a rude comment without knowing the actual facts and just jump to conclusions ... Heres what was going on today : the boys, andy and brook went to IKEA to buy furniture for their rooms since they ALL moved house, jack was with sonny visiting family, and Rye was somewhere as well. They also been busy filming nonstop videos for everyone to enjoy but you know let's get mad at them for not having wifi or a second to answer a nonimportant question at the moment :))

  MY FIRST EP “Orange” IS COMING OUT ON JULY 26TH
  
  Featuring: Running, Flames, Pressure and A NEW SONG called Brown Eyed Boys 🧡
  
  I’ve been writing these songs since I was seventeen. They are the result of heartbreaks and anxiety and mistakes. They’re also the result of magic and excitement and of taking risks. They came from me sitting in my bedroom making something up on my laptop and wondering if it would be good enough to be a song. When I listen to all of these songs together, I get a distinct feeling. A feeling of nostalgia and excitement. A feeling of pain and disappointment. A bit of a bittersweet feeling. Sometimes I see feelings as colors, and this feeling is the color Orange. 🍊

   How are you doing today ?
  ","
  Just feel so much anxiety for no reason today
  "
932187,"
   Oh ok. What made you want to be a skater? And what changed your mind? Also how come it takes you a long while to reply?
  ","
  I was like really young and just enjoyed doing things that were not youre typical girl things. And skateboarding was like my biggest interest. It wasnt until I was like 8 that my life took a different direction. Christina my oldest sister wanted to be in a band but it wasnt working out with her friends. My mom has a degree in music and vocals so we were all taught how to sing from a very young age. Originally .... It was just me and amy and christina who started a band at the time but it didnt really take off at first. In 2010 that when my mom suggested we just started a band as a sibling group since our schedules were all the same and we lived together. The band consisted of our brother michael, christina, katherine,lisa, amy and me. Dani was to little at the time to join. We all took musical theater as well so we knew the basically foundations and kinda picked up on playing instruments the further we went. Our grandmother used to book us gigs at nursing homes as well at the time. When Danielle was a little bit older she joimed the band and Michael eventually backed out from being a member but still helps with the sound and technically things for our concerts and what not today. growing up I wasnt really motivated or focused on actually being a singer and it took a long conversation with christina to actually get me to stay motivated and focused on music. I just thought it was never going to work out but then kath suggested we post a cover on youtube of party in the head which went viral at the time ... And left us shook ... So we kept doing more and more which more views kept coming ... Etc. You can read more about it ... But I think I really realized that I wanted to be a singer around the age of 18 when I decided to go to college and realized I was basically wasting my time because I already had a career that I had since I was 8 ... And I'm just doing extra work for basically nothing... And was really stressed out. There were times when I wanted to quit the band but thank god we took therapy sessions and we are all in a good place now...

  I don't want to sleep
  
  And I don't want to eat
  
  I don't really want to do anything
  
  I don't want to live and I don't want to die
  
  I cant feel any sadness and that makes me cry
  
  I don't deserve to fall inlove
  
  Nothing that I do is good enough
  
  Exhaustion is my new best friend
  
  Cause all the other ones are forgotten
  
  Oh, my cup overflows but its Bubbling with
  
  Liquid loneliness
  
  Liquid loneliness
  
  And time is a man -made construct
  
  And we are just a bunch of atoms
  
  And nothing really matters to me
  
  I'm just existing, I'm not living
  
  And I don't understand how everyone
  
  Seems to have it figured out
  
  There's to much pressure I never asked for
  
  And I was never strong enough
  
  So I pushed it away
  
  Cause its easier to just be
  
  NUMB
  
  I play with his hair
  
  And he plays with my heart
  
  I don't really like him
  
  It doesn't go far
  
  Relationships soon end quickly as they start
  
  He never gets too close so I don't fall apart
  
  All that I want is attention
  
  It doesn't matter who
  
  I don't care how It ends
  
  If I had feelings I would
  
  Cry everynight
  
  Because I'm always self-sabotaging my life

  I'm tired of telling myself
  
  Things are going to change
  
  Then I live my life exactly the same
  
  How can I expect to feel alive
  
  If I treat myself like I already died
  
  I get my hopes up, pretend that I
  
  Know what my life is gonna be
  
  But everytime I love someone
  
  They end up leaving and I tell myself
  
  Its them but maybe its just me
  
  I'm just existing, I'm not living
  
  And I don't understand how everyone seems to have it all figured out
  
  There's to much pressure I never asked for

Then we got a record label with universal island records and moved to malibu.

   How are you celebrating the 4th of July?

  Went swimming by myself first then went  to the family house and helped my oldest sister christina and our friend kiera make a bunch of snacks for a small get together. Alex one of my older brothers did a firework display and we just enjoyed that, and went to the lake and got attacked by mosquitos. Nothing really to exciting being that two of my sisters were out of state on vacation and ome was sick

   A little PSA:
  ","
  I'm literally sick..sick of the hate that is coming my way based on who I like/love/date or even am friends with. Being told if I'm ☘ girlfriend that he is a cheater, and hes going to cheat on me and hurt me just the same as the others. I really think its messed up. I have feelings to, and he always been my entire world amd has always meant alot to me even when we were just friends. So for people to come after me because I choose to love him is wrong. I never once have been disrespected by him or even hurt by him. When I was down he was the first one to check on me and ask if I was okay. He was always there to talk to and lean on when I do desperately needed it. ... So its really wrong you guys believe a tea page just literally digs and digs for one little thing to cause ""drama"" out of. The other girls involved love the drama... Other ones had no clue about it... But were directly out into these allegations even though there was literally nothing said on their behalf. Y'all just want to believe a drama/tea page instead of the actual person or an ex girlfriend that loves the attention and making up stuff for clout. The other ex said it was ""ages ago"" meaning it may or may not have been that person you assume is a cheater. And just because they no longer follow eachother doesnt necessarily mean the claims are true. It could be just to get away from the drama or try to just let it fade over time. No one really knows. But it literally hurts recievinf those messages saying if I'm him girlfriend hes going to do the same thing to me. another topic that's super annoying,  the roadies .... Some of them not all.... But give the other guy a break hes been through a lot as well with allegations being thrown at him to basically having to adjust to not having a member he spent tons of time with leave and another one joining shortly after... I know how I felt when lisa was home sick and we were on tour and ahe wasnt rhere beside me I literally was wanting to cry every second ... But the nonstop hate and disrespect towards all of them need to stop. They work so hard to try to give everyone what they want and expect to make them happy the best they can... And going to a show that they have worked so hard on to do and just try to make it a grest fun night for everyone and being a total fake is wrong. Literally calling yourself a roadie. The boys may or may not have made a mistake, but theyre humans, we all make mistakes get over it. But if you're just going to their shows, listening to their music etc. Just to pull up and allegation about them cheating on ""___ ""  and change the lyrics to the song YOU ARE NOT A TRUE roadie because a true roadie would not even think about pulling that card. And if that is your intention and you still are calling yoirself a true roadie I advise not to go a show, listen to their music, or even mention their names because the boys do not deserve any of this or to be loved by fake fans or any negativity. They deserve happiness and love💛

  This week with Lauren - 6/30
  
  Took this week to ~ relax ~ bc I definitely needed it. I’m usually pretty bad at relaxing bc I tend to feel restless / guilty if I’m not being “productive,” but I had to remind myself that in order to be productive in the future I have to recharge!!! We had 2 celebrations this week with Amy’s birthday and 4th of July, and although I like to celebrate things, parties and big groups of people tend to tire me out 😴 so I had to hibernate a bit after both of those days ahaha but instead of watching tv for 8 hours straight, I decided to go to the book store and read !!! it was so fun and I went a couple days in a row and actually finished a book 🙌🏼 (I’ve only read 3 books so far this year so I gotta step it up 😩) I also went to the lake and the river, but that’s probably the last time you’ll see me swimming in the river cause I got like 30 mosquito bites after that 🥴 ALSO WHEN DID STRANGER THINGS BECOME A LITERAL HORROR SHOW??? I started watching it last night and i was like .... ??????? This is so much. Soooo don’t watch it if u are not looking for a horror show !!!! Anyway, if you need some time to relax, frickin do it man. Cancel your weekend plans, go to the pool, go to the book store, take a bath, get off of your phone and let yourself recharge <3333

   What do u think about what Scooter Braun has done to Taylor Swift.

  I havent read much into it but being that a few people I love and adore have also came out talking about what he's done makes me so sad but also glad I escaped from the la mysic industry even though our old manager was from the uk and she was truly the definition of girl power but just makes me sad seeing how a small fragile life basically lost everything she had because she was signed to scooter as a teen ...and that's Madison beer..
  
  Noticed justin also been fading and he used to be the biggest teen popstar as well.... What happened to carly rae jepson? No one really hears about her anymore. And it seems justin career is basically gone as well

  Yes I have. Like two years ago around october time I was on a trip in cuba with my youngest sister dani and our father to learn more about the living waters for the world organization and to see how they are able to help provide safe fresh clean water to people in need all over the world. We were warned not to drink, eat, or even bathe or use the water to brush our teeth because it wasn't clean water that came from the church or a place that has clean water. So I was super cautious when it came to this and even took the precaution. But I ended up falling really sick when we came back to the usa and I went to the hospital were I was hospitalized due to being exposed to tainted water. But I'm okay and now we have more knowledge of that kind of situation and why living waters does this kind of thing to be able to provide clean water

  The ones that are very sad and have a story behind it that the fans also can connect to.
  
  You're worth it, good enough, acid rain, before octobers gone. Alot of our songs connevt or the story behind it just overall wasnt good. You're worth is deals with trying to reassure assure you you're not what others are saying or even the negative things you believe you are. Pretty pink same ordeal, people care if you're not okay even though you're struggling youre still cared and loved. Good enough, a story about a little girl that lisa used to babysit told her about her life st home and lisa was inspired to write the song which also kinda ties in with how she was feeling at the time. Acid rain I wrote about a boy who was just way to toxic and eventually broke my heart and no matter what I did I would never be good enough for him and at the time I was addicted to the pain while he was addicted to the chase. Before October's gone, was written about danis ex which i will not name because he already got bunch of hate years ago and we all get along but it also repeated with someone again a few years later.

My song ""pressure"" being released finally was a major highlight and I'm so glad sooo many people can relate to it and like the song. Just the feedback is totally shocking.

  Every one has their own demons that they fight on a daily basis that we know nothing about. Which is why so many people are the way they are because everyone assumes they know what that person is going through or theyre ignorant like you and push them way to far that they actually hurt themselves!! Its not a flipping joke. Depression, mental illness, bullying all these factors into self harm and insecurities. Instead of being rude and ignorant and telling people the world would be better without them in it or theyre freaks because of what they do why not show some kindness,support and love? Why not even try to see her perpective of life? Im nkt saying self harming is definitely the answer but neither is sending hate to someone you don't exactly know personally. I'm so sorry alot of you recieve such hurtful rude comments like this... And if you ever need someone to talk to I'm always here to listen and help. I hope things get better and you can be happy once again. Never be afraid to ask for help at your darkest times because there are a lot of people who are willing to help friends, family, professionals and even strangers. I'll leave this here .... :

  U gotta stop thinking of yourself as something to entertain people.  Instead of trying to say interesting things, just to ask people questions about themselves and their life!!! People who genuinely want to connect don't care if you have a ton of ""interesting"" things to say, they just wanna hear about you  and your life. Everyone has their own unique personality and story and no one has ever heard the same from someone else. Give ypurself more credit.

  No. But I do try to work on speaking up more and being more personable ayah I like my chill/quiet demeanor though.
  "
932776,"
   How do you stay chill in stressful times?
  ","
  I don't ahah and I don't think being chill should be the goal. Sonetimes things are just stressful and you're gonna be stressed no matter what! But stress is acrually your brain trying to help you because it's causing you to hyper-focus  on something important that's coming up so you can be prepared. Rather than not being stressed, I try to just put it into perspective. How important is this REALLY? And WHY does it seem like such a big deal? What REALLY matters to me? When I put whatever  I'm stressed about in context with the rest of my life, I'm able to tone it down a few notches, but usually am still at least a little bit stressed if it's something important to me.

   Bianca had to have vocal surgery ... she's ok now and singing better than ever but it must have been a huge scare. I just think it's a bit dangerous to push your voice too hard when you're still a kid.
  ","
  Which seems to happen with younger kids a lot because yes their voice may be very good, or they're trying their hardest to compete against others who may or may not be slightly better than them to impress others such as a judge. Which is why justin bieber for example in his one movie people were worried with him being so young and singing and touring and loosing his voice, singing through strep that he would permanently damage his vocals because he wasnt matured or train to do that. As seen here ... Lisa was sick in 2014 and we were on tour, my sister lisa is a high in the band as well as me but my voice wasn't fully matured or trained to hit her vocals at the time and I was also dancing as well and I literally felt like I was going to pass out and even forgot a part

   Got a message from a possibly fake Bianca Ryan... her performance at 11 on AGT is indeed stunning, but I'm thinking she might have been pushing her voice too hard at that age. Thoughts?
  ","
  It depends ... For a few years even though I was super young my voice was higher than Lisa's. It just depends on vocal range and if shes literally forcing to hit those notes. Like choking off or a voice crack or seeming like she's out of breath and about to pass out. I'm not a vocalist so I cant really say I just know on my experiences and my sisters when one of us are trying to hard to hit it or I have to be face to face with someone to tell if their pitch is okay

   Well that’s a big lie, because I don’t know you, my family doesn’t know you, I’m gonna guess you don’t know Beyoncé personally. There are TONS of people in the world who don’t hate you. Don’t give a select few the power to control your mood so easily. Carry on w/ your jokes & (likely) awesomeness.

   Quote:**
  ","
  When there’s a fresh wound in your heart, keep it open until it heals. Air it out. Understand it. Dive into it. Be fierce enough to become it. If you ignore it, it won’t be able to breath. If you ignore it, it will merely deepen, spread, and resurface later, wanting to release. And when later happens, it will hurt even more, because when later happens, you won’t know what you’re bleeding for … Remain open to feel free.
