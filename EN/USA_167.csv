  It has helped me learn how to express my emotions in a healthy way instead of bottling up or avoiding them till a later time, taught me to coworkers in positive ways with my siblings and learn how to play a role in the band amd listen to others ideas. It also has helped me learn how to love myself and grow as a person through out the years as well and learn how to set boundaries that are healthy not toxic. While it has helped me in my life consider that therapy isnt always an easy fix for others 🧡

   What was the funniest way that you have been injured?
  ","
  Probably running after my friend at the park and tripping and spraining my ankle on top of the growth plate. While in a way it was something that was ""weird or funny"" the pain hit me later on the sec ok and time around when I tried to run after her and it cracked again and then I just walked back to their house on it. Another way which I still dont know how it's possible.... I was leaning against a door and kept rocking back amd forth (someone was behind it preventing it from hitting) they ended up moving and I once again tried leaning against it but ended up losing my balance and fell straight down onto a hard tiled floor and strained my back. I was fine but everytime I went to go bed or move a certain way pain ran through my back and I would wince. I shrugged it off and tried to act like nothing was wrong for 3 days until I went to go help a neighbors child ride her bike and finally I said it hurts to bad

  Falling to my death ... I think that's what scared me the most as a kid and I used to hate heights for the longest time after falling straight onto my face onto a hard gym floor when I was doing water polo. The teacher pushed the bleachers in so students used to climb them and sit on top. I did it once and when I went to go get down I lost my grip and fell. Then I got stuck at the top of a roller coaster that only had the bar and seatbelts across your lap and I panicked because I felt I was falling but after that I kinda been okay with heights.

They didnt share earnings and one person controlled it all. 5. Awkward as heck because I'm very good friends with most of them and even dated them

  Happy birthday to myself (30 years old!!!) and one of the best people I’ve ever met!!!! And now ONE of the best birthday presents I’ve ever gotten. Lauren is truly an amazing human being. I can honestly say that a large majority of what we’ve been able to accomplish with the band and what I’ve been able to do on my own is because of Lauren’s support and encouragement. Even though she was so young when we started things, her constant enthusiasm and support drove me to take risks and put myself out there for us when I was terrified and we would NOT be where we are today without her! She is one of THE MOST creative people I’ve ever known. She contributes SO MUCH not only with artistic ideas but also strategy. Her ideas for music and aesthetics are INSANE and I’m constantly in awe and impressed by everything she does.
  
  I’ll always be so beyond proud of her and wish I could pick out outfits the way she can haha. She’s SO wise, caring and empathetic and her friends are the luckiest people in the world! And how could I not mention how HILARIOUS she is. Her sense of humor and LAUGH are spectacular haha.
  
  Happy birthday to one of the best people on the planet LAUREN CIMORELLI! Our bond will NEVER be broken! Haha
  
  And wow, I’m thirty years old and I have a child! Here’s to a brand new decade and the biggest life change ever!! Make sure to say happy birthday to Lauren! Can’t wait to celebrate with her today like we always do!!! We now just have an extra little buddy with us to celebrate! 🥰 ~♡christina♡~

  Happy birthday to me and also to one of my biggest role models
  
   @christinacimorelli
  
  !!!! For those of you who don’t know, me and Christina have the same birthday! I think we always had kind of a special bond because of that and I always looked up to her soooo much. We have some natural similarities such as we both like to plan ahead and know what’s going on at all times, same kinda taste in food, and we’re interested in a lot of the same topics, but I would be a completely different person today if it weren’t for Christina. She taught me how to think, how to keep asking why until you get to the truth. She showed me what strength looks like as she constantly carries the weight of the world on her shoulders and never complains about it, but also as she’s always willing to take a long hard look at herself, acknowledge her flaws, and put in the always difficult and sometimes terrifying effort to change. She taught me resilience as I watched her get kicked down by life over and over and she never stopped getting back up. She showed me that being fearless doesn’t mean you never get scared, it just means you have the courage to do it anyway. She showed me how to stand up for myself and also to ALWAYS stand up for others who aren’t standing up for themselves. The amount of faith and trust she has in God is something I aspire to have. She is selfless, generous, extremely empathetic, and has an exceptional amount of moral character and integrity. She’s the kind of person everyone would want in their life. On the outside, I don’t think people see how giving and kindhearted she is because she doesn’t try to put it out there and let everyone know that she is because she actually has real humility !!! Amazing. I could go on all day but I think you get the point.... Love you C ❤️❤️

  Ohio's governor made an oopsie the other day when trump was due to visit for the rally ? He had to take a mandatory test to be around trump, it came back positive. Reminder this is the same governor that manditated masks, stay at home orders, the reason national guard is in the city of Cleveland and wants the last call for alcohol and digested at 10 pm no later. He then took a second test not even 30 mins to an hour later and it came back negative? Although they were both different styles of testing they should still give the same results like a drug would tbh. How is that possible? Major red flag thrown there. Also the fact they continue to count one person as each new case each time that one person gets tested? How many people do you actually know that is sick bc of covid? My friends mother died due to a heart attack and on the death certificate they wrote covid...

  Because it's such a intimate moment that should only be shared between the person you know you're going to be with for the rest of your life and you.

   Me I think that if a real thing that people can get sick from but I think the numbers that they're spitting out are lies and that there is far less deaths than what they are saying they just want to use that a scare tactic so people will do mail-in voting
  ","
  Basically they're trying to distract us from something bigger is what I feel like. Like making us wear mask seems like a control thing, enforcing the 6 ft apart rule, or us quarantining for 14 days or staying st home and bringing in the national guard. Plus the explosion in Lebanon didnt seem like a warehouse explosion due to explosives being stored there. It wouldnt have been that big to flip cars and injure people miles away. Plus the fact that other people heard it miles away?? Doesnt sit right with me. Kinda fishy how the presidents are traveling by aircraft to their rallies and all of a sudden boom explosions. It also looks like a bomb or missile coming down to hit when you look at the videos.

  I hope it's nothing to bad. It's just that one gum tissue on my lower teeth/ front if that makes sense is pulling back kinda like a hang nail does but it's not a hang nail it's a gum tissue.

   There are there just a waste of money and buying a 44 million dollar house I'll be happy if I can get a house for $50,000
  ","
  The thing is they just built their ""dream home"" or their ""forever home"" not even a year ago. A project they wanted and worked on for like 3 years almost. And even had like a particular style that they wanted and had to choose between two houses they built but then combined. Mr Kate, a famous designer on youtube did the girls rooms the way they wanted and the playroom. She was suppose to do the entire house as I heard but austin got impatient and just decorated however he wanted and his wife allowed it. Now they're like looking at other houses on the market bc they're ""bored"" and want to make it a ""series"" but they literally wanted to buy the 44 million dollar mansion bc it has a sauna, indoor and out door movie theater, 6 rooms and 16 bathrooms I think he said.  And a vip pool and stuff. When the house literally looks like a 5 star hotel and is mostly all white... they have three children who are not even over the age of 5 yet.

   why aren't you in more interviews let me be your manager and ill make some phone calls and get you on jay Leno lol
  ","
  Back in the beginning of our career we were always being interviewed and stuff. Because we were signed to a record label at the time and our manager was based out of the uk. However, living in california and being in the la music industry just became this thing where we were left unhappy bc they were trying to change us into a band that we didnt want to be ( sex, alcohol,  drugs, dressing revealing wise and stuff). And didnt understand we wanted fun, clean, helpful and relatable music. Music with a message of hope. Positivity and love. And while we had many great experiences through that time we were left unhappy and wanted to quit music for good. Until 2015 came around and gave us an opportunity we had to react on which involved moving to nashville and going independent. Which we did and since moving their we have put out more than 2 albums, toured more than we did in la, eps and so on. Just this year has been hard on everyone and last year was as well. Our oldest sister christina was pregnant with her first child and didnt know she had a genetic thing that caused blood cots at first. She ended up loosing the baby a week before our biy tour kicked off. It was an emotional time for all of us. We wanted to push back the door but somehow even through the pain and lost christina pushed through and went forward to do the shows. At the time we also were rebranding and redoing our band and who does what in the band and looking for a graphic designer and so much more. We knew dani was leaving the band for good at the end of December after being in it for 10 years. Our youngest sister the last to join was the first to leave and it just kinda hit us unexpectedly at first but with time we found what works best for us. As for this year, christina is pregnant and due any day with a baby boy. So we didnt want to do another tour and risk anything that may cause any insufficient to her or the baby. Katherine and lisa were both engaged and planning their weddings for this year. Which katherine married at the end of may. Lisa should be by the end of this year hopefully. Katherine was busy moving into her new house with her husband. Christina has been busy preparing for the baby and the rest of us just felt with everything going on it was best to take the year off from touring or doing to much activities and projects to spend time with our family and friends and just relax a bit. Even though christina is pregnant we planned ahead and worked hard to film, record, edits etc. Content and videos for everyone. And well with covid, it kinda ruined everyone's plans with concerts and festivities and so on.

   I think adoption is a good idea but I don’t think it’s fair that the perspective parents should be able to just pick a child from their looks and see which child they want? I don’t think that is right since we all know which majority of kids get adopted and which ones do not. What do you think?
  ","
  While it's unfair most people look for similarities that will blend in with theirs. Example : husband has blonde hair and blue eyes. Wife has curly hair and blue eyes. They'll most likely want a child with blonde hair or blue eyes. But their is some families like thomas Rhett and his wife who adopted a little girl from Uganda with a different skintone then theirs and they love her and their other children equally. Sadly this is the issue with our society... they think we cant love and accept others because we dont look the same. Have the same background, do the same things or have the same skin tone. And we need to change the way we love and see eachother

  I think it's better if we all just did online schooling until the spike decreases. By forcing children to wear masks, you're taking away their one feature of being recognized in a crowd when needed. Without seeing their full face and appearance it's making children easier to go missing and their abductors will have an easier way to just grab them as well. Also small children dont have the patience to wear a mask all day and will likely take it off or play with it and so on and then you'll be hearing ms teacher he stole my mask and ms teacher my face hurts ms teacherrr

  When we started YouTube I was 11 years old. 11 years old getting getting thousands and thousand of comments about me everyday. A lot of them were good comments, talking about how I was pretty and cute and they liked my voice. Some of them were bad comments saying that I couldn’t sing, or that I was annoying or boring or nothing special. This experience of being commented on by strangers has continued for the last 10 years. And it’s only multiplied in size. These comments RAN MY LIFE for so long. Chasing the approval, and being heartbroken over any disapproval. Reading reading reading. Scrolling scrolling scrolling. Is it good enough? Did that come off right? Do they like me? How many likes? How many dislikes? How many views? How can I be just socially acceptable enough to not get hate but also be interesting enough to be something special? My self esteem was like a roller coaster that was tied to the unpredictable and ever-changing opinions of other people. I eventually had to realize that this is a game I cannot win. I can’t please everyone and I can’t get everyone to like me. I am the person who needs to like me. I need to know who I am and what I stand for and I need to be okay with what other people think of that. Because whether people love me or hate me, I’m still the same. Their feelings towards me and their opinions actually don’t do anything to me. They don’t change my worth, they don’t change anything. Literally at all. Especially since different people can love me or hate me for doing the EXACT SAME THING. This is what our new song #IAmEnough is about. You are enough regardless of what anyone else is saying about you right now. Whether you’re at the top of the world, or you feel like the world is crushing you. Your value doesn’t change ❤️
  
  “Confidence is not ‘they will like me.’ It’s ‘I’ll be okay if they don’t.” #IAmEnough go listen to it on Spotify! 🎶

  I would definitely want to be remembered for the good things I've  done in life and not my mistakes.

Maybe someday someone will find something of mine that I left behind and become interested in knowing who I was and then I'll become this person everyone loves and remembers again

   It’s not adultery when the marriage is between three or more people 😉 and it’s all consensual, of course. Ethical non-monogamy. — And why can (in your point of view) someone only love one person? You said yourself: we have multiple friends, maybe multiple children, etc that we all love. 🤔

   What you think of girls who post bikini pics on social media sites? Be honest?
  ","
  I used to see a lot about a year ago but it kinda died down and I'm sort of glad it did. Posting tons of pictures in your swimsuits or lingerie and so on makes it seem like you're okay with everyone in the world seeing your body when it should only be you and your husband or wife seeing it. How would you feel if all of a sudden you found out a bunch if 90 year old males fap off to your pictures or hang them up to plaster all over. Or say your little niece or a kid comes over to someknes house and sees you naked/ half dressed. A child that looks up to you and idolizes your every move and so on. You wouldn't be happy to know that the child saw what you were doing and went and did that themselves would you? It's time people start having more self respect for themselves and realize anyone can be watching

   Hi Lauren. I loved the song :)  Which of you does the music, or is that an outside producer that does that for you?

  We all write down ideas and lyrics and sometimes we will either take one song fully written by someone or it's like 50/50 divided. This song was written by my sister lisa 🧡 and normally it's me that puts together the track and demo.

   Why You Should Stop Comparing Yourself With Others! (and How to Do So)
  ","
  Bc no one is the same and we all are different.  Stop trying to be someone you are not and never will be. Sure the other person might have good traits like pretty eyes and a smile but that's how god created them. And you probably have the good hair and a good heart that others may envy. My point is everyone sees something in eachother that they desperately  wish they had while they fail to realize that they are perfect the way they are already. You don't  need to try to change in order to be accepted or fit in. Because someone out there appreciates and loves everything about you and you just need to find them. We all have our strengths and weaknesses  as well and together that's what makes the dream team. Work together and stop comparing. And learn to love yourself and your flaws

  Theres a total of 6 of us. We don't like being annoying and the center of attention because well we come from a big family so everything was divided and we had to focus on eachother and help out when needed.

And our mother raised us to where we have respect for others of all ages and treat them with the respect we would want in return because we never know someones situation or why they're acting a certain way until we are put into their situation to relate.

  Growing up we worked with choreographers for various shows we did for tour especially digi fest. And some original shows. But our voices were still improving and not as strong as they are now that we would become choked off or out of breath from dancing at the time. That we stopped doing it for a few years and would choreograph certain dances ourselves for a cover or something. It was recently on the ILYOW PART 3 tour that we decided to bring dancing back into what we do and so far we kinda been nailing it. Lisa was the one who first started taking classes and well I wanted to try new things so I also been taking classes. I also dated 3 professional dancers growing up and know the William's family who we collaborated with a few times over the years that I also learn from

   Maybe 10 years ago you would have had a chance since he was in young money. How about Shawn Mendes, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horian where do you stand with them and do you like their music?
  ","
  I probably  have more so of a chance collaratong with shawn due to the fact me and shawn used to talk and there was even a joke we did one time. Camila cabello was also ""discovered"" by my older sister lisa years before she became part of 5h and they used to talk and be friends. As for the ex 1d members oof I would die

   How do you feel about knowing that Tristen is married now?
  ","
  Honestly. I'm a bit disappointed he moved on quick but we havent been together since February and everytime we tried to talk or work things out it would always result in am argument and none of us were ever satisfied or truly happy. And I've come to the realization  that no matter how much effort or whatever you put into something that you're not always going to get exactly what you want. And that's what was going on. I was inlove with him but he didnt feel the same way about me anymore and he moved on while I was still holding onto something that wasnt meant to be. And I'm glad he found someone who he loves and they love him back. Eventually I'll find my forever person or someone who I love just as much and get the same respect and that back. Somethings just aren't meant to be or isnt the right time and I think for me and tristen although I loved him it just wasnt the right time or place and who knows what may happen in the future. I have no hard feelings towards him at all and wish him the best. But right now I'm focused on myself. My career and doing what I want to and having a path I want to follow along. I'm totally fine with us being friends or just checking on eachother but I dont see us being together ever again

   I've been sober for 2yrs now. Last night was one of the worst I've ever had. I was contemplating if I should break my sobriety, lock myself in a room and drown my pain away. My 7yr old niece called me out of randomness and told me she loves me and is so proud of me. She saved me. God is so Good! 💙

  I'm glad you are okay now 🧡 stay strong and always give it one more night bc you never know how much change can happen over night.

   What would be great and what would be terrible about all humans having translucent skin and muscles so that you could see all the organs working?

  Great bc you can see easily what's causing pain or discomfort or needs medical attention. Bad bc people dont like seeing blood and organs and stuff all like that

  My friends cousin who was like 8 at the time and her and her aunt and stuff were all hanging out with eachother and my friend was like 13 at the time and an early bloomer so she had like her time of the month and stuff. And well her birth control (she had a cyst on her ovary and her organ prescribes her them). Was at her other cousins house and she couldnt grab them right away so the kids got into the pills and like messed them all up and stuff so she just took whatever was remaining in the package and wasnt expecting a period as she already had hers. Well she went to karate like 3 days later and they were doing training for a yellow belt and she went to use the bathroom afterwards and noticed she started bleeding again and she told her aunt about it and her cousins friend who was around the same age but they were like whispering it and her cousin wanted to know and started to cry because she said they were keeping secrets from her ... she was to young to understand

   If you were a character in a typical horror movie and was stuck in a house with a group of other people with a monster lurking around somewhere, how well do you think you'd do? Why do you think so? 😈🏚
  ","
  I would try to hide somewhere that people wouldn't really look like under the stairs in the corner. I think I would last longer than most tend to do because when they hear a noise or something their first response is to shout hello whose there and go looking for the person or whatever which gets them killed. Your first instinct should be to run or hide and get to safety
