  Well I am married, but I never had a proper wedding- we were going to save that for our five year anniversary but Covid hit and now we are in our sixth year 🤣 so we plan on 10 years, a renewal and first wedding! At first we wanted a masquerade theme, darker sides of colors like red, purple, black. Now, we'd probably do an ocean-y theme. I'm studying to be an Oceanologist and my husband and son love the ocean too. I also love the analogy of our relationship being like the ocean. It can be calm or rough with us, but we just keep going with the flow and it's a beautiful journey. Our colors would probably be more on the cooler side now... blues and purples. Maybe some sea greens.

  As adults, we can warn kids and teens about the effects of certain events they may choose to do, but ultimately, they have to experience it for themselves. Sometimes a fuck up is what someone needs to actually get the picture. I WISH I had listened to the adults in my life, but you have less care when you're younger and feel almost invincible... until you reach the age or maturity or shitty experience to realize you're not.

  No no no no no do not fall under the stress of that. After I had my son, I was considered obese. No doctor mentioned it so it must've not been too concerning. I was 160 and if I can toot my own horn for a sec, I think I looked bomb af. Now, 3 years later due to a stupid fast metabolism, I've been dropping weight and it sucks. I looked up the weight I would have to be in order to fit into ""normal"" and it was 125. IMO, if my body would have allowed me to stay at 160, I would've. I felt so much more active and I had more energy. I think 125 is too small for myself personally.. (for reference, I was 88 pounds when I got pregnant)((not by choice)) -  numbers don't matter if you're **taking care of yourself**. We all have different body types... no one knows your story but you.

  This sounds awful but it worked out for me in the end. One of teachers when I was younger had a fling with my mom. When I found out that he was married, I threatened to call his wife (I even had his number highlighted in the phone book) unless he gave me good grades and rides when my mom wasn't feeling well. Now, I would never do something like that, but I was young and found some dirt. What do kids do with dirt? Have a little fun. I don't feel bad about it because the school I went to was in a hick-racist town. I'm surprised anyone even touched my mother knowing she had a half-black child.

Within the last few months I have been exploring it and it's been amazing.... which says a lot coming from someone who thought that believing in anything bigger or beyond us from the celestial front was ridiculous. Did not go any sort of traditional route but I am learning so much more about myself than I think I ever have. Also, actively expanding my career, making healthier eating choices, and trying to welcome more positive energy into my life/home. Next on my list that's been hanging over my head like an old dead goose is decluttering. Got too much crap that doesn't serve me anymore.

   Is it possible to still find love even if you lack any physically attractive qualities?
  ","
  We are pushing 8 BILLION people on this planet. It's safe to say that everyone has a chance. However, with our life spans, we have about 80 years to find at least one. But a skeezy old man I watched on TV once who married 20 years his junior (when talking about love) said something like, ""All that time I looked for someone to love and she wasn't even born yet!"" Yeesh to think about, but is very common with people marrying someone with quite a large age gap between them. Internet dating, or maybe traveling the world to gain experience and maybe some true love along the way! In short, yes, it is possible.

  I think there is classier pda then a lot of what happens in public. But then again, it's very personal. Having full blown sex is pda and so is simple hand holding. Line-crossing is easy with how many opinions are out there.
  
  For me, it gets a bit inappropriate when the making out starts. Then again though, in certain places, if it's not to much, it can be appropriate. Saying goodbye at the airport, train station, etc. This is hard question for me because it's so circumstantial 🤣

   When you had a personal issue that felt like it was damaging your life, who did you go to for answers
(I don't mean to sound rude for saying this but plz don't say god)
  ","
  There's many options here. Counselors, therapists, etc. If you don't have the money or means, a *true* close friend or family member you trust to get advice. I also suggest some sort of community app if you cannot do the first two options. You can be as anonymous or as forthcoming about your identity as you want to be. If you are going through something specific, and can find more people who have had that issue, you have that ""expert advice"" so to speak.
  
  I hope that helped a little!

  ","
  If you are already to a point where you are feeling this need to step back, do it! But let him know why and that you need some space. It's completely on him how he chooses to react, remember that. If distancing yourself is best for your mental health, do it.

   So I just found out today myself that my boyfriend while at work will sometimes watch pornhub because he works overnight and gets bored sometimes when he doesn’t have anything to do. I looked on the web search history and that’s how I found this out. I need advice - What do I do?? Is this ok??
  ","
  At work, ballsy lol - In general though, you have to ask yourself if you're okay with it. People have their reasons why it's okay for them and others why they don't like it. Either way, it seemed to shock you, in which I recommend talking to him about. Ask questions, after all, he's not only your boyfriend, but his own separate person who thinks, behaves, etc, differently than you. If you have Q's, ask him. However, you must also accept that this might lead into other discussions about other parts of the relationship. Accept many alternate outcomes before jumping into a topic that *can* get dramatic. I don't know how long you both have been together, but what I do know is that the sooner you express your feelings the better. You don't wanna be sitting in them. Now, you might get a response back from someone accusing you of being insecure, as porn in relationships is such a personal thing. Sometimes yes, it is because the person is insecure, but other times, just like anything else, it's just because you don't like it. Your moral or values go against it and that's okay. It's all okay. But nothing will happen if you don't make things happen. Sit with how you feel before you talk to him. How important is this to me? How am I going to react if he has a bad reaction? You do what's best for you though. Every time.

  I've met many other Olivia's, and I've hated every one of them. So I feel like yeah, maybe those with same names have similar traits.

  The good people are waiting for you to stop looking. They will find you. The moment people see you loving yourself, focusing your love fixation on yourself and doing good for you, that's when someone will come along and match that energy.

  The only babysitters I've had for my son are family and close friends. They've all been great with him as expected. I love when I would either pick him up from somewhere or I would be coming home to him, he always needed a mama snuggle after we got settled in. Now of course with of this pandemic nobody has babysat him since March. It's just been me and him! And daddy in the evenings and weekends lol - but we love it! He gets snuggles anytime he wants💕

To the point where I needed food but I also needed to not have food lol - at this point in my life, my great great aunt/very best friend, who was alive at the time, was sitting in her chair watching the news and I, who was sleeping on the couch at the time, tried to look as normal as possible while making my way to the kitchen. I wanted Ramen. I boil the noodles and when I go to lift the pot up, I grab it with my bare hands causing me to drop it leaving a big ol black dent in the floor. I know you probably meant a cooking incident but none of those were big deals.

   Why is love so difficult?
  ","
  Well so many reasons.
  
  When I studied childcare, we talked about nature vs. nurture and just how many factors can alter a child's existence. I feel like it's the same with adult relationships.
  
  First, we were all children once so we grew up different off the bat from varied living situations, people who showed up, people who didn't... Then we grow up, and enter into other people's worlds whether it's for a short time or a long time, taking away lessons, physical items, and even mannerisms.
  
  We are always changing; our age, who is in our lives, where we live.
  
  Relationships are hard because it's (usually) 2 very separate lives coming together.. and that's a lot of experience to pack into one place! Learning how to navigate each other can be difficult at times!
  
  I hope that made sense! Maybe this was more rhetorical, but I found it interesting :)

   What do you do when you have a panic anxiety attack and you feel like you can’t breathe?

I had one and I thought I was going to die. I ended up going to the hospital today.  it was so scary ;-;, any defense mechanisms that  help you that I could maybe try?
  ","
  I GOT YOU.
  
  I have had anxiety/panic attacks since I was a child.
  
  First, you gotta make a kit of some sort so when it happens, everything to help you is in one place. Or just throw everything in a backpack 🤷🏽‍♀️
  
  •Stress relief drops.
  
  I take Rescue Remedy drops by Bach.
  
  •Some sort of calming essential oil scent, roller or bracelet you can use to smell. It helps. Especially in labor but that's not something you need to worry about lol - they recommend lavendar, but I'm allergic.. just find some that you find pleasing.
  
  •Something cold on the back of the neck is also relieving for me.
  
  •Look up breathing techniques and practice them so you don't forget next time an attack happens. I usually write myself a note, ""Don't forget your breathing!""
  
  •Find a focus object while you are doing your breathing or close your eyes and try to visualize something you find calming and happy.
  
  •Pressure points are a big thing for me. I find that ears are a hot spot. Have someone (or yourself) massage up and down your ear, as there are many pressure points on your ear that relieve stress, pain, what have you. I rub on my ears for many reasons. It's also comforting.
  
  •Natural muscle relaxation. Start with your toes and mindfully relax each body part moving up. I was told to go from up to down, but I find that if my body isn't relaxed first, my brain definitely won't be until then.
  
  •I like mantras. I've memorized this one:
  
   https://youtu.be/wIZqghmN24U
  























  I'll repeat it whenever I need it. Sometimes just in my day to day when I need some grounding, healing energy.
  
  •Hydrate after. Very important. It's very stressful to the body, obviously.
  
  •Take a shower or bath afterwards to relax your muscles even more. Having an attack is very straining on your body.
  
  With all this, it's very personal, as we deal with ourselves how we see fit..... but I hope at least one of these suggestions finds you relief when the time comes :)

  I would say, ""cool"" and move on. Stripping has a reputation but it's still a job. Some people do it because they enjoy that kind of work and some do it to support themselves or children. Maybe both. If you are uncomfortable with the act of stripping for money or any other kind of profession such as this, before you start dating, a good first question would be, ""What do you do for a living?"" If she was hiding it, I would ask about it, supportively, and we'd have a discussion about it and how we both felt about her career choice now being out in the open. I would then ask what I could do to help her to feel more comfortable about the situation, and if there was anything else she wanted to get out in the open.

   Thoughts on Amber Heard abusing Johnny Depp?
  ","
  She's 🌌trash🌌 period. She is part of the problem why people who have actually been abused are afraid to come out and tell someone. This situation also makes it harder for men who are being abused to speak up openly without judgment. The only people who will truly know what happened between them is them, but I have looked at what has been said, and I have read the opinions of others online about confusing parts in her story which I had also agreed with. In short, I think she's to blame but is getting off easy because she's a female.

  I don't mind housework in general, but there are parts of it that I groan at the thought of doing. Such as, unloading the clean dishes...it's the constant bending over after I already loaded them an hour ago to be washed. Also the folding of clothes, an actual enemy of mine. We are investing in a slimmer vacuum because lugging our ancient one around is just so awkward with the flow of our house.

  I had an ex who did nothing BUT that. I am not into hunting as a sport whatsoever. If you live somewhere thats far from civilization and you need to hunt for food, fine. But I don't support hunting for sport. If it's illegal for humans to hunt humans for funsies.... not counting snipers... then it should be illegal to do that with animals plain and simple. Fishing I found quite fun though because we either did catch and release or we'd actually eat the fish we caught.

  ","
  Without this virus, my neighborhood got maybe 20 people. This year, I know that there are parents who are still hellbent on taking their kid out, so I made see-through treat bags... that way, there's less germs from little hands touching everything. I'm going to keep them on a card table outside. I'll probably decorate the table, maybe put some music out there, but I don't expect much traffic. My wedding anniversary is on Halloween, so we are a big Halloween family. We have one upped ourselves every year, but this year, we are doing it simple which is fine. The inside of our house is super decorated though! When I was a child, usually, my mom would take me to the rich neighborhoods... they had the best and biggest candies. Rarely I went with my friends because I had to walk in the cold with them and I'd rather be called ""lame"" in a nice warm car while getting giant-sized chocolate bars, than outside freezing with some acquaintances in an average neighborhood getting the cheap stuff lol

  Well I would usually get a babysitter (my mother), then a hotel at my favorite place for the weekend with my man. Maybe go out on the town for the evening, clubbing, with however many drinks turn me into Bambi when he was learning to walk. Go back to my hotel, have a dip in their hot tub, then go to my room, order a ton of food and pass out in front of the TV watching Harry Potter. However because of COVID, this year I stayed inside my house, had a Disney Jr. dance party with my little guy, and passed out in my own bed watching Harry Potter. It was still good though!

  ","
  Have someone else in the room while you talk then maybe, like I said? Someone older than the both of you and someone your brother will listen to. Or there's the timer idea maybe with a reward of some sort. Children respond well to reward systems (take it from a decade long teacher.) Basically, he's bugging you because he loves you, obviously alot. My son is the same way with me. It just really comes with the territory of having a small child around. I use distractions sometimes with my son as well. I also use bribes though too.. if he behaves during something, I take him to the park. You have to find out what works for your brother.. it's very individual.

  How little are we talking? What's the age difference? I'm a little confused about the last part of this 🤔 Have you sat him down and talked to him about boundaries and why they're important? Maybe a step further if you've already tried that, like having a guardian mediate.. if your brother is maybe too young to have a conversation, maybe setting some sort of alarm for how much time you need for yourself, when the timer goes off, he can spend time with you. If you're not above bribes, candy, a $20. Think outside the box.

  No. We are in this mess because of greedy money hungry people don't care about anyone else.

  Hi! That's okay, experiences you have with things you can't see can be confusing to whether it actually happened or if it's in your head.

   I think people make the argument that children shouldn't be exposed to the harsh reality and that history should be sugarcoated until they're older. I didn't know the truth until they told us in high school. The education system is responsible for giving the truth, though.
  ","
  My mom always told the complete truth about everything I asked which may or may not be super effective with most kids lol.. but not even in high school did my teachers or any of our history books told the full truth. I think high school is the perfect age to learn about it... however I also believe we should let children know what has happened in the past (not as gory) but as a lesson that hate and discrimination does nothing but divide us.

   What do you feel when someone is copying you? #CopyCat😺
  ","
  Unless they are trying to be me online to make me look bad, I take it as a compliment. I would love someone to love what I'm doing so much that they want to do it. The things we do as a world influences everyone else at all times. It doesn't make sense when people have a bad attitude about someone copying them when that's literally what we all do with everything. The movies we watch, the clothes we wear, piercings, tattoos, etc. I don't think my mother would have ever gotten a tattoo if I hadn't of told her I was getting one. Plus, if you think about it, if I had green hair and then other people got green hair because I did, they didn't really copy me exactly, because there are many people out there in the world that have had green hair before me and will continue to do so after me.

  Hello!
  "
855063,"
   I'm a 21 year old male and I have a co-worker who is in there early 50s female. I'm sexually attracted to them and they are not married but does have three kids. We flirt here and there. Should I try perusing it?
  ","
  If you want. But keep in mind, and I'm just assuming, that if she wanted anything from you, it would probably be mainly sexual. If she is looking for something serious, she probably wouldn't go for someone so young. If the relationship is purely sexual but feelings happen mutually, you also have to think of her kids. If they are adults or teens, might be having to then deal with them and their opinions because they're most likely gonna have one. Is she 50 with children? Are you prepared to possibly play daddy to 3 kids at 21? I don't know the whole story but, pros and cons my man.

I also don't have to wear pants when I shop online which is rad. I hate not being able to see if the clothes fit me, but I also hate trying on clothes so I'm biased. I just don't like shopping period, online or in stores.

  Well there are people out there who don't like to ""share"" persay, but calling someone unattractive after having told them that they are attractive before finding out something they don't like or support is clown shit. If someone isn't comfortable with something that another person says or does, make the other person aware of why things can't continue and respectfully make your exit.

  Oh man so much. Most importantly though, sex isn't talked about in depth. It's ridiculous. Talking about sex does not automatically make everyone have sex. There would probably be more safe sex practices among teens if they had the proper knowledge. I'm glad my mom answered all my questions because my school absolutely failed...  we had to open a childcare room for our school because of so many teen pregnancies. I'm so glad that I'm able to educate my siblings about safe sex because I already know their school won't do it properly 🙄

  People actually take the time to do that?! I guess negativity never stops in an angry soul. What I do when I get crap on here, is to post a gif that has nothing to do with what they're saying. Usually they will continue to get angrier and I just keep sending gifs and laughing at them getting more mad. People like that just want a reaction. Don't give them one! You're just giving them what they want! If it becomes too much, keep blocking them and completely ignore their harassment. 👌🏾

Nah. I've had dogs, they cool but they needy. And expensive. I got a child, he is enough 🤣 - Cats are chill, they fit my personality perfect, and sometimes when life gets in the way, I don't have to worry about the cat, it's probably asleep in the window sill minding its own business.

   Do you need/Would you need to communicate with your significant other every day? (Text, phone call, in person)
  ","
  For example with my man now, when we didn't live together I didn't care if we didn't talk everyday. Now that we live together, I prefer daily communication if I need something while he's out or what time he will be home so I know when to start a meal.
  "

  Blue's Clues

  ","
  People starving right now, being abused and held captive with no escape. The thought that someone is probably being tortured right now or a kid is being currently stalked by a deranged person only to be kidnapped and never heard from again. Yeah I think it's all worth it.
  "
855617,"

  You're really hurting your own feelings at this point. You're anonymous. I don't know you or the question(s) you asked. I answer questions in the order I choose. Some questions require a little more brain power and I don't have that much these days in quarantine with a toddler. Never take anything online personally.... you'll end up getting many hurt feelings.

   What's your weirdest date?
  ","
  This guy asked me out to this pizza/bar.
  
  His words were, ""I'm trying to get to know you.""
  
  We're sitting there eating *in silence* as he's literally shoveling in food and staring at the game on one of the TVs.
  
  Every time I try to ask him a question he gives me short, vague answers.
  
  During my last attempt at a question of trying to get to know this guy he turns to me and goes,
  
  ""oH i sHoUlD wArN yOu i DoN't TaLk wHiLe i EaT""
  
  .....even though us eating was the entire date.
  
  So I sat there in silence for 45 minutes while he inhaled his meal.
  
  When we got in the car he gave me two options,
  
  ""I can either take you home now or we can go to my place and I can DICK YOU DOWN.""
  
  I told him that I wanted to go home because I don't do that shit on the first date.
  
  He got MAD AT ME, told me to get out of his car, and long story short I took the bus home.
  
  Moral of the story: Take your own damn car on dates lol - first and last time I ever did that 🤣
  
  I did end up giving the rest of my pizza slices to a homeless guy which felt worth it in the end.
  
  The end.

  Move on obviously. Why would you want to waste your time sulking over someone who doesn’t want you? Find someone who does. Put your energy into that. If you continue to suffer, remember, you are the only person who is suffering over this. Not worth it in my opinion.

   Based on how you look, what kind of person do you think people think you are when they first see you? 🤔😅 Why?
  ","
  I honestly don’t know. I have such a skewed view of myself as it is. Sure if I’m feeling pretty I’ll take a selfie and post it, but the reality is I don’t look like that all the time. 95% of the time I look like a homeless man. I’ve been asked if I was fake or not which I still debate with myself if that’s a compliment or insult. I couldn’t actually tell you what people thought of me because of the way I judge myself on a day to day basis.

   Thoughts on people who constantly post about how they are single on Instagram
  ","
  I think that trying to make these apps be you’re own personal diary is obnoxious. I’m not necessarily saying to suffer in silence, but if you’re having a hard time, y’all to your friends about it... not every single person on your friends list. It looks pathetic. Occasionally mentioning your status is fine. Actively complaining about it is why I don’t have FB anymore. I have a private insta where I can control the content more IMO.

  Running late for something, it’s getting too late and they need to go home, they need to feed their cat, they fell out of love, maybe they have an appointment to get to or their hungry and want to get some food. There are many reasons why people leave.

  That all depends on the person and their willingness to change.

  ","
  I don’t think we should freak out about it, but stay smart about it. All these high school/college students on the news like, “I’m not going to let this virus ruin my spring break, if I get it I get it.” Just pisses me off.... like well damn, I hope you get it! Take this seriously but like everyone is saying, do not overstock your shit, there’s enough supplies to go around if we don’t over buy. There will be less deaths if we start thinking about others instead of just ourselves.

  Oh okay! But what if your friend who had cancer, also had a good percentage of living? Would you risk it by saving his life for the chance he may make it, or would you go for the cure because you’d need a for sure answer that he would make it out alive.

  Unless you signed up for part time, you have a shitty job it sounds like. If you feel like you’re being discriminated against, I would write down examples and evidence over the course of a few months (date it too).

  Put the shotgun and the shovel in the closet, jam the door with some of the boards, I would stack the boxes in the closet where imma hide, take off my shirt and put it on the opposite side of the closet, stick our part of it so the monster thought I was on that side.... so I guess when the monster goes one direction, imma slide that bear trap over to it, try out the shotgun and start the damn boxes on fire. If we both die in the process then at least it won’t hurt anyone else 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️ is use the shovel to try and beat my way outta that room 😩😩😩

   What are your thoughts on Dr assisted suicide? 🤔
  ","
  I am 110% for it. Yes, I definitely think you should think of your friends and family first, but in reality, it’s your life and your body. If you are living in pain and will be living in pain indefinitely, I think you should have the option to end the pain. If you had a disease or condition you couldn’t control, I think you as a person should be able to decide how you’re going to die. That movie, Me Before You is so heart wrenching but necessary. The man was in pain everyday, he had tried to gain the life he knew back but after a while knew he wouldn’t get it. He chose the Dr. assisted suicide. Of course loved ones are going to be upset, but they also have no idea how your body/mind feels. I feel like if you’ve tried other options and they are not working, you should be in control of how long you’re on this Earth. I’m not sure what’s on the other side, I’m spiritual but I’m no way religious, but wherever the soul goes, I have enough faith to believe it’s someplace amazing for the good of heart.

  I always wanted someone who had almost no similarities to me. “Opposites attract” but more extreme.. I had it in my mind that we’d have more to share/give to each other. Well the more we learned about each other the more I realized we liked a lot of the same stuff and ended up with a strong bond because of it. It’s a weird expectation, but that’s what I wanted. There’s many other little things, but that was a big thing. Most of the guys I dated before were very much the opposites of me and that’s what I thought I wanted.... as I look back I realize that those relationships weren’t as fulfilling as this one is.

  For cold weather, a coffee shop is lovely :) not at Starbucks though, somewhere that’s local to you... IMO it makes it more special and important.
  
  For a playful date, a comedy improv is perfect. You’re laughing, the actors are interacting with you, and you can really see the personality of the person you’re going out with!

   Tips to counter insomnia?
  ","
  Nothing ever actually worked for me, I had to be put on prescription meds for it.
  
  What I’ve tried:
  
  -Non-caffeinated tea helps.
  
  -Also I found a podcast that helps fairly well called, Sleep With Me. This older gentleman just talks about random boring content in a very monotone voice, puts my friend right to sleep she said.
  
  -I also make a playlist of relaxing music (instrumental) that I’m not familiar with. I find that if I know the music, even if it has no words, I’ll tend to want to hum it lol
  
  -Lastly, it’s recommended no electronics at least an hour before bed. Not the most popular, but if you’re desperate and tired enough, this may work for you.
  
  Melatonin helps for very temporary use, but it can cause longer term affects such as leaving you with more insomnia than when you started.

  Strength of course. Everyone says that pain is weakness leaving the body, but I feel that tears are also directly related. Tears can be because of pain or because of happiness and the same goes for pain.... pain can be necessary (tattoos, pleasure, whatever) and it can also be because of hurt (physical or emotional) we as humans need to cry. It’s helpful for healing and in my opinion, very necessary.

  ","
  There are a lot of things in my life I wish I could go back and change. One main part being high school.
  
  I dated this guy all throughout high school (thought we were going to get married) and I invested my ENTIRE time on him. I wasn’t interested in school whatsoever and ended up dropping out.
  
  I eventually graduated years later, but I never graduated on time with my friends, I never went to prom, I never experienced the rewards of being done because I hadn’t earned it.
  
  Now, as an adult, I realize that learning is amazing, the best part is, there is ALWAYS something new to learn.
  
  Maybe I don’t retain every little detail, but I am fascinated by everything.
  
  I love learning about animal interactions in the wild, ancient empires and their rulers, deep sea exploration and what’s going on in space.
  
  Explanation kinda long but hey, I have time 🤷🏽‍♀️

Plus, I thought to myself, if I had really liked this guy would I have been able to constantly eat in silence with him every time? Ultimately the answer was no. I hope he finds an equally silent girl though... or one who doesn’t mind utter silence... if he hasn’t already. 😊

  ","
  Exactly what my ex did to me... total mental abuse/control. They do it because it’s one of the most ultimate power moves designed to make you feel like they can get anyone they want but they are choosing to be with you, lowering your confidence and thus being trapped to stay with them because you don’t feel like you deserve better....

  ","
  I made it clear to my man that that’s NOT a joke to me whatsoever. So if he ever tried that “joke” with me, I’d have to believe him. When you’re in a committed relationship, no matter how much you joke around with each other, I don’t think that stating you slept with someone else is a tasteful joke. Sometimes when people “joke” they are telling the truth, wanting to see your reaction, and if they don’t get the reaction they want, they play it off as a joke. That how my ex boyfriend did to me and refusing to believe he would do something like that to me, I let it go. Turn out he was not only sleeping around with many women, he was sleeping with my best friend (former) for the 3 out of 5 years we were together. I think I’d ask you... what does your gut tell you? Can you trust the person you’re with or when you heard the “joke” did you immediately get a strange feeling like it wasn’t just a joke?

   What is your favorite quote?
  ","
  There two. Both by Dumbledore. It’s cliche, but have gotten me through a lot.
  
  “Dark times lie ahead of us and there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right.”
  
  This quote helps me get up everyday. The “dark times” can mean the world or within ourselves and I always use it as a tool to look inside of myself. It would be easy for me to stay in bed all day and waste however many days/weeks/months/years I have on this planet.... OR I can get up and do shit. I fight through depression and anxiety everyday to raise my son. I hold down two jobs, have started the process of going back to school  and I still think I can push myself more. I wasn’t put on this planet to waste my own time.
  
  The other quote:
  
  “Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”
  
  This is a more well known quote that hits home. It helped me through the death of a family member. And still helps me process it years later.
