extremely lonely .","782611":"figure out what s wrong . go through all the major categories of your life friends , relationships , school , work , family , emotional state , mental health , etc . and think about how they re going and exactly why they re going wrong . then think about how you would like them to be instead . figure out what steps you need to take to get them where you want them to be and start taking them .","782612":"ahahah the best thing to do if you don t wanna start a convo is just look at them until they look at you not in a creepy way but in like a cute way and then smile when they make eye contact . do this a couple of times and if they re interested and have the confidence they ll find a way to talk to you . that worked for me","782613":"i know that s really scary , but you are not alone ! ! ! and being diagnosed doesn t change anything about how your life is . you are still the same person and you still do the same things , you just have a better understanding

depression and anxiety is manageable ! ! ! and there are so many of us right there with you don t lose hope . you will be just fine keep fighting","782614":"do everything you can to move on ! ! ! most likely , you probably don t know this person that well and you ve built them up in your mind to be this perfect person that they actually are not . but even if you do know them well , you don t actually know if they would treat you well ! ! and if they don t like you , clearly y all ain t a match ! if you are super devastated and torn up about it , that means that you were putting unrealistic expectations on this person to either make you happy or fill the void inside of you or make you feel like you re worth something , but the reality is no one can do any of those things for you . you need to love yourself , fulfill yourself in healthy ways , and cultivate your own sense of self worth and self love !","782615":"i talked to him about it already thank u though","782616":"choose something that you are interested in . something that you would be excited to wake up and and do everyday . don t tell yourself you can t do something you really wanna do .

something , you don t have to stick with it forever . you can change your mind and you change your course and it will not ruin your life . and don t let people choose for you . you know what you need

body were all our memories , thought and knowledge is stored and the brain sends messages to other parts of our bodies so our arms can move , we can speak a sentence etc . but we also need our heart . if our heart isnt working as the partner in crime for our brain then our brain shuts down because our heart isnt working and our heart needs to be pumped blood and beating to survive","782747":"congratulations","782748":"same time i usually sleep to unless i have like an off day were i didnt sleep well etc","782749":"tristen","782750":"yeah because on really sure you would sit around for a month waiting on someone who only talks to you when it was convenient for them or they actually missed you . you can try to call me out all you want and accuse me of cheating but in that whole month i tried to contact him , i tried to keep him in the loop , i left messages and everything . only to be completely ignored . i didn t cheat i simply let go of someone who wasnt worth wasting my time on and moved on . there is nothing wrong with that . you can not make a relationship work especially if only one person is doing all the work . he could ve told me he was busy or whatever but never did . half the information i found out by looking at his profiles . oh and let s also not forget that he s the one who actually cheated . . . and blocked me and wouldn t explain why or whatever till months later . let s remind you how he claimed over and over he loved me but completely fell of the face of the earth for months before i even got a simple hi from him . and then you claimed to love me but then go on to post you lied and are is still obsessed with an ex who is in a relationship and i was like the rebound . i m sorry but i will not stand to be used , manipulative , lied to , and a rebound for someone who doesn t value me . sorry i found better and sorry that person treats me the way i want to be treated . but its his screw up because i m way better then the girl

did almost all of the chords and melodies and put the lyrics together and then i produced it ! dani wrote the first lyrics we used for first verse and chorus and we went from there . . . and lisa tweaked a couple melodies after christina had finished the song ! and lisa and christina both wrote the harmonies . a true collaboration ! ! dani was inspired to write believe in you because emmyn her fiance has been struggling with things in his personal life and not seeing his true value and that in life so while she was thinking she was thinking about him and what she sees based on what he does and how she could remind him that she like believes he can fix or imorive things . and then we all kinda tied it in with our own meanings . because when do we ever tell ourselves that we believe in us ? and say positive things . we always let things tear us down or we are our own worst enemy . christina was thinking about a friend at the time who also been dealing with a lot of road blocks in life

last weekend ! ! was so special thank you to everyone who came on a more personal level , i had a big realization just this weekend . i ve always had an issue with people pleasing and putting others first to the point that i completely forget to take care of myself and my needs . i ve done a lot of work over the past few years to get over that and i was doing a pretty good job for a while recently but this week i realized that it was coming creeping back in . and i was doing things solely because i didn t want to upset people and almost every conversation was so exhausting because i was hyper focused on how the person i was talking to was feeling and trying to respond in a way that i thought they wanted me to respond that i was completely losing myself . i ve been running myself into the freaking ground trying to prove myself to everyone in pretty much every way you can and stressing myself out so much that i ended up getting sick and basically being forced to take a break and take care of myself . all that to say i decided that for this next week i need to protect myself and make sure i have the time i need to relax and decompress and be alone . i don t have to be there for everyone all the time and neither do you ! ! ! ! if you relate to any of that , i really urge you to take a step back , take a breath and start putting your mental and physical health first

also forgetting that jack has a baby now and she only gets to see him about maybe times out of the whole tour schedule and actually spend time with him . sometimes he s only there for a day before

awful atm","783373":"we actually met her at the teen choice awards years ago . shes a very sweet lady","783374":"hollywood related things are a sin","783375":"when we had to film official music videos for the label or go to red carpet events or photo shoots , we had different teams of stylists that would do the girls clothing , hair , and makeup . they always brought clothes over to try on a couple of days in advance of the event , which was fortunate , because rarely was there anything acceptable to choose from . everything was too short , cut too low on top , and the shoes were all stiletto heels . how is any of that appropriate for a year old or any minor , for that matter ? ? i told the girls from the start to not be afraid to tell the stylists that they were uncomfortable with clothing like that and that it was off brand for them , as they had built their huge fan base off of clean covers and good , clean fun . it was a good lesson for my daughters to learn to stand up for themselves and their values , and of course , i was standing right there behind them if anyone were to give them any grief about their stance . the stylists would then return with a new haul of better choices although sometimes only slightly better , but this scenario happened time and time again , so clearly there was an industry norm or a directive in there somewhere that ran toward the inappropriate , even for minors . when we did our first professional music video with the label , i received an email asking if the older girls would wear something a bit more revealing . i showed the email to my daughters , and they were horrified . they wanted to sell their music on its own merits , not based on showing some skin . we put our foot down , and the outfits finally chosen were ones that my daughters were comfortable with .","783376":"https youtu . be fktddknrwjk","783377":"no lol we kinda just roasted eachother","783378":"my mom actually wrote about it kinda on her blog and we

universal island records for a few years and had a lot of great times , opportunities , and met some amazing people . but a few years after they were trting to change us and turn us into something we will never ever be . and it left us devastated , lost of hope , and wanting to give up on our dreams for good and quit music . then in , we broke away from the la music industry and went independent artist under our own label and moved to nashville tennessee for a fresh start on life after we were given an opportunity that we had to act fast on . since then we came out with bunch of music , which shows our true selves and found out purpose of doing music again and the message we want to spread to our followers .","783387":"home","783388":"life","783389":"a small jack o lantern pumpkin bucket
