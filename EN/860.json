social media pages geared to dance and that s kinda fun , but the problem is i don t really know how to get there . plus , i don t currently live in a state that has many big dance opportunities like california . i also feel like to get a job in that industry that isn t dancing would probably require a business degree and i don t wanna get a degree in that mainly bc i don t wanna take all the dumb business classes they force you to take at school that have nothing to do with what i want to eventually do . i ve seen some business classes and they did not seem fun . i wanna find ways to do what i want that doesnt involve college , but i kinda feel pressured to get a degree bc it feels like its what everyone expects . another option for me would be to try and just find a job i like that doesn t require any degree and take a break from college . i have a job currently , but not one that i like , but i could try that and hope smth hires me . . . . but today i ve just been feeling kinda

haha","796400":"it s actually a little hard to answer that bc i have a friend who i have grown up with we knew each other since we were practically babies , but nowadays , i know we don t tell each other a lot . we live across the street and her family used to always have dinner with mine and we have summer activities we do together so we were pretty close , but then as we became teenagers , we both became a bit more reserved with our separate lives i think . i knew there were bigs things in her life she wasn t telling me so i kinda stopped trusting her . i would consider her my closest friend , but at the same time , i have told some of my deeper secrets to other friends bc i felt like i could talk to them more . they told me their sh t so i told them mine and that made us closer . if we lived nearer to each other , we might be really close by now . but since this first friend lives across the street , we are always being in each other s lives , so i may not be the closest with her , but she s the one i see the most , hang out with the most , known for longest . . . . so basically , it s hard to answer that question .","796401":"if they are surprises that i like hahah","796402":"that s sweet . i don t really know any kind thing for me to do tho and i would have to fight the feeling that i don t deserve anything kind these days","796403":"which one ?","796404":"idk maybe it s that i don t message people back very timely all the time , but the people i don t message back quickly are typically the same who don t message me back quickly , so idk . . . . and that s not really a habit . . also , my quietness might tick people off","796405":"it does . and i go by jaye a lot because it s j but with a spelling so that s it not just one letter .","796406":"no","796407":"hmm . neither rn , but typically , toast","796408":"some people call me j bc my name starts with a j","796409":"instagram","796410":"oh gosh , idk , i don t wanna be a part of this","796411":"sorry , what ?","796412":"yessss","796413":"yeah , for some people i think there s definitely a big difference .","796414":"nah , it came from two of my younger cousins . we were all in the car going to my aunts and their dad has nicknames for them and so they were calling each other them and then decided that i needed a nickname too . i assume one of them came up with chips bc there was an empty bag of chips near us in the car and so they voted that that was gonna be my nickname . after that , it just kinda stuck , but i use it more for online things no one really calls me it , but i like it . it kinda reminds of like a computer chip bc i really love technology , so it s kinda fitting . a nickname that people call me a lot is j tho","796415":"haha","796416":"you can t really love someone else unless you really love yourself first","796417":"i really want some root beer rn","796418":"i don t really know any ngl","796419":"hi","796420":"difference to what
