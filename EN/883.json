Maybe you're wrong.

What's crazy about wanting to achieve something new?\n  ","947400":"\n  I believe and follow my morals. That way I don't lose my integrity. As you see in the my last post or online if you did your research, hardly anyone follows the \"law\" of God completely.\n  ","947401":"\n  What qualities from my imagination? I'm only going off of the God that your saying right now.\n  \n  Here's some of the thing God thinks are sins. If you're guilty of any of this, apparently you're going to hell. And there's a lot more too, like showing your skin (think about times people go to the beach). You can do your own research on Google.\n  ","947402":"\n  Haha alright, maybe\n  ","947403":"\n  Maybe you live life as a test. I don\u2019t live my life as a test. I live it as if it\u2019s the only chance I get (which sucks), but that\u2019s what I believe bc again, I don\u2019t believe in afterlife. Most people live their lives as if they only get one life (yolo) because no one knows what truly happens after death.\n  \n  Then why make the person disabled in the first place? Why do they have to wait till another lifetime to excel? All that does is bring a lot of pain to the people who lose the person who God decided to kill off for no reason, for the rest of their lives. You can come with \u201cperhaps\u201d and \u201cwhat if\u201d for anything for the rest of your life doing so, but the point here is, there\u2019s no proof or anything that leads to God thinking gay people are bad. Anyone can die. People die at different times with different amounts of innocents. That\u2019s just how life is. If God is controlling all of that because of who God likes and who they don\u2019t or whatever reason, then there\u2019s no explanation that you or anyone can think of to justify God not being an a** in some way or another for doing so. Every possible way, as you are showing an example of now, leads to God being unjust in some way. So either God is overall a bastard or your theories about God are all messed up in some way and it\u2019s time to rethink.\n  ","947404":"\n  And who says people decide whether they live or die right before puberty? Where did you get this from? And the mind is never complete. Time to do some research. We are always trying to find ourselves and are always learning more about ourselves and becoming wiser.  That definitely doesn\u2019t stop at puberty. So that kind of disproves this theory of yours you just presented.\n  ","947405":"\n  I don\u2019t want to be somewhere where I don\u2019t belong and I don\u2019t belong in world where I can\u2019t be myself and be accepted. I don\u2019t belong somewhere where it\u2019s okay that people I love get oppressed. So I am proud not to go to your God\u2019s \u201cheaven.\u201d The way you put them, both heaven and hell sound like dystopias. So being in hell wouldn\u2019t be much different for myself and all the other gays. There is nothing that makes every single person happy in the same way. So there is no one place wirh certain and restricted conditions that could fully satisfy everyone. If God says I will be happy in heaven then that\u2019s because I will be with the people I love there. If they aren\u2019t there and I can\u2019t be proud for being myself there, then I won\u2019t be happy and in contrary to what you say, God does not know everything.\n  ","947406":"\n  Then God is still an unjust a** for giving some people the chance to get better prizes in the end than others. You said God does not favor anyone, but he has to be either favoring people who are gay or people who aren\u2019t gay in that case because some people are being born able to succeed more than others in the end. That\u2019s an unfair set up. And desire is a feeling, so that part of what you said does not make sense. If we can\u2019t control our feelings, then we can\u2019t control our desires. If God does not create something without a goal, then maybe open yourself up to the possibility that God created gay people because God is okay with them. Why do you demand that being gay has to be a bad thing in God\u2019s mind? (This brings us back to where our conversation started). Might I remind that not everything in the Bible is followed to this day anyway and God does not seem to mind. If he did, then just about everyone would be getting punished.\n  ","947407":"\n  Each of them would be to have 3 more wishes. Then I would have 18\n  ","947408":"\n  December because it\u2019s winter break and the city is happy and thankful and cheerful because of the holidays and everyone has lights up and we have eggnog and pumpkin pie and sometimes it snows and the snow looks pretty (although I hate having to go places in the snow)\n  ","947409":"\n  In addition to my answer for your previous question: if you can make it float in the dessert, then why not? That means you are doing above and beyond what others were capable of. Sounds like you\u2019re made to thrive and achieve great accomplishments.\n  ","947410":"\n  It is designed so that it CAN have sex with men and reproduce. It does not have to. There is no rule that we HAVE to. At least not where I live \u2014 the US. I understand in different countries there are different expectations and the places where getting pregnant is one of them, I feel sorry for them. But that\u2019s not a worldwide rule, that is just a government expectation in those places.\n  ","947411":"\n  You\u2019re going back to where we started now because the fact is, just about everyone disobeys God. This is something I brought up before, near the start of our conversation. There are a lot of things in the Bible that God says is a sin, that people do in modern times. I\u2019m sure you are guilty of several of those things.\n  \n  I will proudly disobey someone who is bigoted and selfish and oppresses people for nothing but their own amusement (or just who oppresses people at all), and I will do it along with the millions of others who support me and agree with me and fight for equal rights. I don\u2019t think anyone who is gay finds going into this God of your hell a punishment.\n  \n  And these are your beliefs. Not everyone believes the same thing you do and everything you believe about death and afterlife could quite fairly be false.\n  ","947412":"\n  Who are the people you mentioned? I say that this version of God that you seem to believe is not fair because they aren\u2019t ting some people be born either better futures than others. This God you say, makes some people have to be oppressed and not allowed to be themselves for their whole lives while others can be themselves. That is unjust.\n  ","947413":"\n  Now you\u2019re implying that everyone who was born decided to live, but then not everyone who was born lives because some people die early. So that makes no sense still. So, the five-year-old who caught cancer lost their chance and are now being punished? Why? They did nothing wrong. They were just an innocent five-year-old who never got to live their life. Let\u2019s say they were battling this cancer for 3 years before they past away. They never got the chance to even walk yet. So that\u2019s just God being an a** in that case.\n  ","947414":"\n  But I am proud of my belief and so are millions of others. So, you are therefore incorrect. It cannot be happy for me to live in God\u2019s Dystopia that God calls Heaven either, if God is such an a** as you say, so I might as well be unhappy in the same place as the people I love than just unhappy.\n  ","947415":"\n  Exactly, actions can be controlled. That\u2019s what I have been saying (geez, you\u2019re impossible). No one has to have sex with someone of the same sex, they can control that. But they can\u2019t control their feelings about that person. If they are in love with that person and that gender, that is how they are. If they choose to have sex with someone of the same gender, that is because they are just choosing to be their true self and express their genuine feelings instead of faking their whole life. So, people should not have to hide who they are for their whole lives just because they were born a certain way. They can\u2019t control how they were born; they can\u2019t control how they feel. So how is that fair? That\u2019s I\u2019m saying God is an a** if they are purposefully setting some people up to fail before they are even born. And I don\u2019t want to be living in God\u2019s place if that\u2019s the kind of guy God is.\n  ","947416":"\n  It's not changing nature because nothing is changed when you have sex with someone of the same gender. Nothing happens except joy from the two individuals. A vagina doesn't have to go into a penis. That's just how making babies works. If you want to have a baby, you put your vagina in a penis. If you don't, you don't. Not everyone has to have babies, in fact, not everyone can. And putting your dick in a vagina is a sexual desire. If people aren't sexually desired to do that, they won't (or they will, but they will feel like trash while doing so). If they are sexually desired to have sex with someone of the same sex, they will do that instead.\n  ","947417":"\n  We already established that love is feeling and feelings cannot be controlled or changed by ourselves. Our feelings are involuntary and are part of how we are born. I am gay and that cannot change. I'm am attracted to women and that's how I was made. Just like you were made attracted to the opposite sex of yourself (I assume). You can't just change yourself and decide to be in love with someone else. That's not how love\/feelings work. So stop going in circles and get that through to yourself.\n  ","947418":"\n  What's to say I haven't felt in my heart that I'm doing the right thing?\n  \n  Let's just say there is a right and a wrong way. It just brings us back to the question why would God create gay people at all if it was the wrong way? This seems to be something you don't have an answer for and if you can't find it, it makes more sense for you to question what you're believing rather than me.\n  \n  Since I'm here along with millions of other gay people, it must be fine. Otherwise how did we get here?\n  ","947419":"\n  But why doesn't God not want to give the people who die earlier more opportunities? That's just unfair. You think all young people who die early wanted to die? You think Nipsey wanted to die? Martin Luther King wanted to die? Trayvon Martin wanted to die? I've wanted to die, but I'm not dead so clearly just wanting to die isn't the answer here.\n  \n  You can keep trying to come up with answers, but you will realize there's no logical explanation. There's simply nothing proven scientifically and\/or Godly that leads to being gay as bad. You're just making guesses now to try and defend something you don't even know as to be true and every time, there's an explanation that questions what you're saying completely.\n  ","947420":"\n  I say I prefer hell if that if God is bigoted and sets some people up for failure while others are just naturally born with \"better\" fortune.\n  \n  I will be happy in hell knowing I lived life as my true self and not someone someone else wanted me to be after creating me a certain way in the first place, or in other words, just trying to make my life harder on me for no reason.\n  \n  I can't be happy in some place where only people like me who can't live geniunely go. That's an after life dystopia.\n  \n  So then I will be living in eternal happiness in hell where I can be myself and be able to be proud of who I am. And the people I love will be there with me.\n  ","947421":"\n  Again, killing people is not an emotion or feeling, that is an action. You are confusing actions with feelings right now and you will be confused until you learn the difference. Try a dictionary. We can't control what we desire, but we can control our actions. Obeying, killing, walking, running, shouting....those are ACTIONS. I said that already. Instead of just talking, maybe go back and start actually reading what I'm saying.\n  ","947422":"\n  How is it a change in nature if people are born gay? That is nature.\n  ","947423":"\n  I like them as friends but have never felt romantically attracted to one. I've fallen in love with women and I find them attractive.\n  ","947424":"\n  How will that tell me the right way? What's to say I don't already pray to God? And I'm still gay so.....\n  \n  If God doesn't prefer one person over another, then why would some people go to a good place and others a bad after death then?\n  ","947425":"\n  That makes no sense and sounds more like you're making things up as you go along.\n  \n  That still unfairly limits the child for getting as much reward as someone else who just happens to be more luckier and not have cancer.\n  \n  What makes the child not have the option to try \"the test\" but other's do? If God can see the future and they know who will be good and bad already, why not just kill off all the good people right away and send them to a happy place right away? Why not send all the gay people and whoever else is or becomes \"bad\" to the bad place right away?\n  ","947426":"\n  I\u2019m really not worried about afterlife because I don\u2019t believe in it. I believe that when we die, we die and are nothing. Our bodies decompose and we cease to exist. But if there is an afterlife, I would rather go to hell or \u201cthe bad place\u201d and know that I lived my life advocating for my rights and loving whoever I was truly and deeply in love with instead of faking everything just to please some selfish being who wants to punish people for truly being and embracing themselves. If God is gonna punish people for being gay, then that means God set every gay person up to fail in afterlife before they were even born which would make God a bigoted a**hole more than anything else.\n  \n  Again, if God created everyone, then gay people would not exist if God had not created them. Being gay is about loving someone the same sex as you. Love is a feeling and feelings, as we already went over, are not a choice. They aren\u2019t controlled by us. So, to punish people for being gay is punishing them for being something God themselves created them to be. Something the individual cannot help, control or change about themselves. So that\u2019s just messed up.\n  ","947427":"\n  What are the resulting actions and how are they bad? There is no evidence of consistently bad things happening to every gay couple.\n  ","947428":"\n  What about men? Men have romance. Every gender has romance. I personally am only attracted to women, I have never fallen in love with a man. But that doesn't mean men don't have any romance.\n  ","947429":"\n  That's not what I said at all. You should go back and re-read if that's what you think I said.\n  ","947430":"\n  So now God chooses favorites? Why doesn't he want me to live my life the way I am?\n  \n  And why did he create me the way I am in the first place if he didn't want me to be this way?\n  \n  I think I do not need your help for the same reason you think I do. Because I have different beliefs than you.\n  ","947431":"\n  (see past response)\n  ","947432":"\n  (see past response)\n  ","947433":"\n  (see past response)\n  ","947434":"\n  (see past response)\n  ","947435":"\n  (see last response)\n  ","947436":"\n  So young a five-year-old who gets cancer and dies but is completely innocent has to die and get less rewards then others who are more fortunate? That just seems purely unjust. The five-year-old may not be able to overcome cancer, but that\u2019s only because either they are young and aren\u2019t very physically strong yet or the cancer is just really bad. It is not the fault of the child in any way. So, it sounds like you\u2019re saying now that God sets some people up to get rewarded in the end more than others just because.\n  ","947437":"\n  Stealing is not an emotion, it's an action. We can control our actions.\n  \n  -Someone who is deeply in love with someone else should not have to hide it their whole lives and pretend to be in love with someone they are not for their whole life. If that were the case, then those people are being punished before they are even born, which makes no sense and is simply just wrongful.\n  ","947438":"\n  -We can\u2019t control our feelings. Our feelings\/emotions are involuntary. They are just part of us. It\u2019s a mix of our intuition and logic that leads us through life.\n  \n  -If good people die because they deserve a \u201cbetter place\u201d, then why do some good people die really young and others die when they are old? Why do some people deserve a \u201cbetter life\u201d sooner than others when they haven\u2019t done any more good in life? And why do many people who have consistently done \u201cbad\u201d things live very long lives?\n  \n  -No one who is gay wants or needs your help and telling someone being gay is gross is not helping in anyway. You\u2019re not showing anyone the right path; you\u2019re just showing people what YOU think is the right path. You are trying to enforce your beliefs and your religion on other people who simply don\u2019t care because they have their own. No one here know what\u2019s happens afterlife. Everything you think is just a theory from your religion or your community. You can never really know because you haven\u2019t experienced being dead. The best way to help people is to accept and love them for who they are instead of demanding that if people don\u2019t live their lives based on how some being who (supposedly) wrote an outdated book thousands of years ago says, they will forever be doomed when there is no evidence to prove that, in fact, more evidence on the contrary.\n  \n  -I know I am lesbian because I am and have always been only romantically attracted to women.\n  \n  -We have more neurons in specific places in our brains that allow us to be smarter than dolphins in the ways that we are. So, this distinguishes us from animals (aside from humans) which proves wrong what you said about being gay makes us no different than being animals. Clearly, there is a lot more that makes us different from animals than just loving whoever we were made to love and being proud of it.\n  ","947439":"\n  You left a lot of my questions to you unanswered still \ud83d\ude44\n  \n  I am a lesbian. But my support for gay rights ofc applies to anyone who is gay, man or woman. Or anyone in a homosexual relationship for that matter, no matter what their pronouns are.\n  ","947440":"\n  People who continue to do bad things they still get away with it though. Nothing happens. There are many racists in this world who are thriving right now for example. Why? Where is their punishment? If their only punishment is after death, then why does it matter at all? If all gay people are just gonna be punished after death, then why are you concerned? What does it matter?\n  \n  So there\u2019s innocent people who get cancer and die really early because God is saving them? From what? How is stripping the rest of their lives from them by letting them die from cancer saving them?\n  ","947441":"\n  People are connected to anyone they love because they love them. Otherwise there wouldn't be a loving connection between the two. Nothing but the feeling of being in love can make two people love each other. We are not robots being mind-controlled .....(yet) haha\n  ","947442":"\n  You provided no valid evidence or reasoning to that there is defect though, pretty much negating what you said. If there is no actual example of this, then how is it true?\n  ","947443":"\n  Well then answer my question about why many gay people have thrived in life.\n  \n  And why do so many people who have done terrible things get away with it?\n  \n  And why do many people who have done great things die early?\n  ","947444":"\n  That's just false.

The main reason was bc I didn\u2019t get the classes and time schedule I wanted and it\u2019s frustrating that my major is so competitive and I\u2019m not the smartest person, so I already have very little chance of getting in even without only 30% of people getting in and I never took any running start, which I\u2019m mad at myself about and added that to the list of mistakes I\u2019ve made concerning my future, so therefore I\u2019m a freshman by credits (one of the few freshman by credits at my school, cause like everyone else did running start) so my class selection time is gonna be last pick all year, which means the classes I need to be in to fill my prerequisites will either be full or fill up super fast by my selection time, so I won\u2019t be able to apply for my major in time (but I guess that shouldn\u2019t matter, cause I\u2019m not gonna get in it anyway). And then today, I didn\u2019t get a score I was aiming for on my Calc test, even though I felt like I didn\u2019t do that bad and my first test also wasn\u2019t a score I was aiming for and I hardly have the time to put more energy into that class than I\u2019m already doing so, so I\u2019m not gonna get a very high grade in that class which will look bad when I\u2019m trying to apply for my very competitive major, so basically my future is f*cked.
