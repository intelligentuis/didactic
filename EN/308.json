involved for me at least but i can never pinpoint what the fear is it s like a sense of impending doom .","284951":"yes . they re using drinking as a coping mechanism to deal with their mental health , which isn t healthy . that s how a lot of people become dependent on alcohol or any other sort of substance for that matter .","284952":"a bit anxious , but otherwise fine . i m just listening to

it doesn t correctly portray bdsm practices and could lead to dangerous situations if people model their behavior after those in the book . things like consent , safe words , etc etc . also , apparently the man in the book is a manipulative person this is all that i ve heard from other people though , i ve never read it myself .","284962":"no , we just did our normal grocery shopping on thursday night . we already have an abundance of hand soap in the house anyway , which is what s most important .","284963":"depends on the context of their argument . if they re denouncing every organized religion and are simply voicing their opinion , then i see nothing wrong with that . however , if they re targeting a specific religion and being discriminatory , and you feel the need to challenge their views , then i think it s appropriate to discuss why they perhaps feel that way .","284964":"i m sure it s already banned in some places , lol . but i don t personally believe so it is a very problematic book and movie , i m assuming and i think people should be more aware of how dangerous it is , though .","284965":"it isn t a matter of shying away , because there are some schools with s x education courses . the problem is funding , i believe , because most schools do not have adequate funding to provide comprehensive s x education courses .","284966":"p rn objectifies women because it gives off the impression that women are simply s x objects and not a living , breathing human being . there s more of an emphasis on male satisfaction than female satisfaction .","284967":"no , it s an absolute terrible way to learn about s x . it doesn t teach you about consent or foreplay , and there s no communication involved . for proper s x education , there are informative videos you can watch as well as being honest with your partner about your likes dislikes . even s x education in schools is lackluster .","284968":"i believe the oldest game i ve played is duck hunt on the original nes when i was a child . i remember being in my cousin s living room playing it with them when i was very young .","284969":"plaid leggings with rips in them and fishnets underneath . i don t have a picture , but they re super comfy and also my aesthetic","284970":"eh , somewhat . it entirely depends on what the person did to screw up the first chance they were given . every situation is unique .","284971":"i ve always wanted to travel cross country via car and stop at all of the scenic rest stops and other various nature preserves along the way . nature and traveling are both deeply important to me because i believe they help in a person s development . i m not sure if i ll ever have the chance to actually travel cross country , but if the opportunity presented itself , then i would totally do it .","284972":"eventually , sure . not necessarily in the form of children , but i would like to have a partner and various adopted animals .","284973":"there is an idea of a patrick bateman , some kind of abstraction , but there is no real me , only an entity , something illusory , and though i can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable i simply am not there .","284974":"i m doing well . i m listening to a fallout ambient soundtrack while working on some freelance writing for my job for extra cash . i m trying to be productive today because it helps my mental health , so i have some laundry going , i made a pot of coffee , and i cooked breakfast earlier this morning . i m thinking about cleaning the house a little bit later on in the afternoon .","284975":"struggling writer who cannot finish a single piece of work while also relying too dependently on things such as drugs and alcohol in an effort to enhance creativity .","284976":"i believe it s different for everybody . some people are ready for marriage at a younger age , while others are comfortable waiting many years to find someone with whom they click on an intimate basis . i believe a person may be ready for marriage if they simply cannot fathom a life without the other person in it somewhat , if their communication is pristine , and if they re able to navigate through disagreements without hostility . there should be a sense of emotional intimacy there , and ideally your partner should not only be your lover , but also your best friend .","284977":"i try my hardest not to , but it s inevitable for everyone to judge a person based solely on how they look or present themselves without getting to know them on a personal level . it s something i m cognizant of we re humans and we re not perfect , and as much as we all know that it s wrong to judge someone at face value , we do it anyway .","284978":"mobula rays can leap multiple meters into the air and belly flop back into the water . some scientists believe that it s to attract a mate , but there are also some sources that believe they simply do it just for fun .","284979":"go through life at your own pace , regardless of how other people show off their lives especially on social media . there is no exact timeline for how you should and will complete things , and everything will settle in its place when the time is right .","284980":"perishing alone with no one by your side , whether it s in an emotional or physical context . my worst fear is being abandoned by others , so if i were to pass away , it unsettles me that there s the chance i will be completely and utterly alone .","284981":"yes , there s a significant difference between being honest and being rude . it all depends on your intention and how you phrase things , how you come across to the other person and how cognizant you are of your tone of voice . being honest is always a good thing , within reason , but you should be careful with how you word your thoughts if the other person is sensitive or in a bad mindset . being rude , on the other hand , is when you have no regard for the other person s feelings to where your honesty is hurtful .","284982":"i ve always felt most at peace in the woods so going on vacation in a snow covered region in a small cabin in the forest sounds most ideal to me . i recently went on a tropical vacation , and while it was certainly fun , it wasn t really me , so to speak . i liked laying out in the sunshine and having a stiff drink , but i would much prefer scenery such as mountains and forests and streams .","284983":"having a mental illness doesn t excuse you from exhibiting poor , problematic , or toxic behavior . you cannot blame mental health on your inability to uphold friendships , relationships , etc etc . , because you re acting in the wrong . of course , some mental illnesses explain the behavior but it does not excuse it . you still should be held accountable for your actions .","284984":"yes to all of the above . someone s sex , gender , race , religion , disability , etc etc . , should not determine what rights they re entitled to .","284985":"yes , depending on the situation . obviously every situation is unique , though . there will be some situations where it works , meanwhile other situations where it doesn t .","284986":"i m not sure i understand exactly what you re asking . you answered your own question in the former half of your statement .","284987":"it depends entirely on the situation . sometimes a conclusion does not necessarily justify the means by which a person goes to accomplish something because it could hurt others in the process .","284988":"the answer should be quite obvious , if you know what equal rights means . if not , i suggest you google it .","284989":"rights that involve equity for all people regardless of their gender , sex , social status , race , disability , religion , etc etc .","284990":"it s been my default means of coping with difficult situations and trauma since i was a pre teen . eventually it becomes ingrained into your subconscious , and it s hard to break the cycle .","284991":"similar to my last answer from you , i believe people deserve equal rights , including oppressed minority groups such as the lgbtq community , women , trans people , disabled people , jewish people , etc etc .","284992":"mayonnaise , ugh . i can t stand the sight , sound , or smell of it .","284993":"i haven t checked my wishlist in a long time , haha . right now , i have various books on there , as well as a small treadmill , a backlight for my television , and candles .","284994":"yes , i believe so . feelings of love should be mutual in relationships , and if one person is feeling less strongly or more strongly than the other , and it s causing a detrimental effect to the relationship , then it s a conversation worth having .","284995":"i m not in a bad mood i m actually doing okay this morning . i just made breakfast , and i m about to start working soon .","284996":"things like swim suits , perhaps mesh shirts that show the entirety of a person s upper body , things of that nature that would be more appropriate in a going out , adult setting rather than being in school . please be advised that i m in no mood to have a heated discussion about things , so if this conversation turns hostile , i m going to simply delete your message .","284997":"being disloyal and disrespectful to your partner by establishing another relationship or otherwise cheating on them , and then lying about that relationship to your partner . any healthy relationship would establish trust and communication , and if someone was feeling a certain way other than love towards their partner , they should feel comfortable talking about those feelings . there s also the issue of domestic violence against spouses and partners , which obviously is terrible and more than just a mistake .","284998":"that s your opinion , and i respect that . i believe quite the opposite .","284999":"i m pretty sure it s this one . i chose it because it s a gorgeous photograph that i took when i was on the cruise .","285000":"it takes a lot of time for me to be comfortable around new people , especially because most of my friendships are at least two or three years old at this point with my longest friendship because years old .","285001":"i believe people can wear whatever they want to school , within reason , and crop tops aren t really that big of a deal in my opinion . school systems just have a tendency to chastise women and girls for wearing certain clothing items because they might be distracting , meanwhile they don t chastise other people in the same school systems for items of clothing they might wear , especially men and boys .","285002":"it s not really an ornament , per say , but my favorite aspect of my house is my bedroom particularly a painting my friend drew for me on a commission that shows all of my favorite fallout characters and other things from the video game . i don t have a picture of it since i m on my laptop right now , unfortunately .","285003":"i don t go to restaurants enough to really have a favorite . i used to like ihop , though .","285004":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","285005":"striving for a better life turns unhealthy when you re more focused on your goals than you are on our own self care , when you don t know how to take time out for yourself because you re too worried about progressing forward in life . self care is absolutely important , and as motivated you might be to better your own life , it s essential to make sure you re emotionally and physically healthy too .","285006":"i don t generally make bets with people , so i honestly can t remember the last time i did something like that . if anything , it was over seven years ago .","285007":"no , i m super impatient and even waiting on line at the pharmacy or grocery store is very frustrating to me , haha .","285008":"i judge others by lower standards than i judge myself . i m super critical of myself and i always set high expectations for myself , which sometimes is my downfall because when i don t meet those expectations , i become extremely disappointed , frustrated , and angry .","285009":"i believe that i would rather have one intimate soul mate with no close friends rather than having no soul mate with a lot of friends . i ve never liked having a large circle of friends because it s difficult to keep up with everyone , and the idea of having one person who understands your soul better than anything else is extremely appealing to me .","285010":"eh , i have both healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms . i wasn t doing well last night , so i drank semi heavily . however , i also find that talking to other people and distracting yourself with work and hobbies is effective as well .","285011":"i believe they re equally as important to love means to show vulnerability and compassion towards others , whether in a platonic or romantic way , and it also keeps us humble . to be loved by others is also important because it s crucial to have a support system of others to have around when you re going through difficult times .","285012":"freedom is having the rights you deserve in order to think , act , or be treated equally to others without any interference or restraint from other people .","285013":"i hope you have a lovely day as well ! ! my day has been short thus far i only woke up maybe minutes ago , haha . i just made a pot of coffee , and i m perusing social media before starting on my weekend work .","285014":"no , i believe having rights and having responsibilities are two entirely different things . to have rights means to have equality among others in both a social and legal aspect , such as civil rights , gay rights , women s rights , etc etc . responsibilities , on the other hand , are obligations we have on a daily basis to live our lives successfully . responsibilities are often seen as things like paying bills on time , going to work , making time out for ourselves , fixing things when they go wrong , etc etc .","285015":"depends on my mood in that particular moment . i like alternative rock , indie rock , hip hop , classical music , jazz , the blues , heavy metal , and nu metal .","285016":"yes i have a black lace shirt that i wear with ripped camouflage leggings with fishnets underneath , as well as combat boots .","285017":"my best quality , in my opinion , is my compassion for others as well as my passion in my hobbies . my worst flaw , on the other hand , is being self critical and self destructive .","285018":"i prefer tattoos over piercings . i don t have any piercings , but i have seven tattoos with plans for a few more at the moment .","285019":"i m not much of a fan of edm , they all sound the same to me , lol .","285020":"no , i tried a few vr games in the past and they just made me incredibly dizzy .","285021":"i ve only ever watched movies such as spirited away and howl s moving castle , but i thoroughly enjoyed them and i m more than interested in watching more of his productions .","285022":"i m almost too good at convincing other people of things , tbh . i have quite a good poker face and i can tell someone what is believed to be a fact and have them believe me without any corresponding evidence whatsoever . it is both a blessing and a curse .","285023":"true crime , writing , literature , video games , music , the arts , politics , television shows about law and law enforcement , civil rights , alcoholic beverages , animals , the supernatural , conspiracy theories , and comedy .","285024":"no , i wouldn t want anyone famous subjected to the horrors of askfm .","285025":"my aesthetic","285026":"my personal favorite , yet very unhealthy , coping mechanism is drinking alcohol . however , if you do not want to be like me and drown my sorrows , i would suggest healthier coping mechanisms such as venting to friends family , partaking in hobbies which you enjoy , and working .","285027":"i m not doing the greatest , but i m better now than i have been in the past few days . i also took two shots of jack daniels and have had four beers , so . . .","285028":"i would say a , giving myself the benefit of the doubt . lmaoo . i enjoy singing , but i m aware that i m absolutely horrible at it .","285029":"no , he can simply sign away his rights to the child . it all depends on the situation , though , as to whether or not i personally think it s appropriate . if a man doesn t want to be involved in his child s life at all but doesn t sign away his rights , and then falls behind on child support payments besides , then that shows that he s basically a sh tty human being .","285030":"i used to watch listen to the rooster teeth podcast or off topic by achievement hunter , but it s been quite a few months since i ve turned into their podcasts .","285031":"i ve never really lifted weights before , besides doing regular arm exercises on the machines at the gym . i mostly have done cardio in the past .","285032":"i listen to the radio every morning , actually . it s easier to turn the radio on in the morning rather than plug in my phone to use spotify . i also like the different programs on various radio stations that they do in the mornings .","285033":"yes , without a doubt . i would try to fix my past relationship and ensure that it wouldn t have failed at the end .","285034":"i used to think it was twice , but now i only believe it has been once .","285035":"i don t like cooking , but i like making scrambled eggs , bacon , toast , and sausages in the morning . i like breakfast foods over anything else .","285036":"perhaps the basement . i only go in there once per week or so in order to do laundry . the other option would be my roommates rooms , haha .","285037":"i had thought i left my lamp on all night when i woke up this morning , but it turns out it was just the sunlight seeping in through the window shade . it was a lot later in the morning than i had expected it to be .","285038":"i do not have a tiktok account , nor do i cosplay . so this is inaccurate on both accounts .","285039":"i like the combination of beards moustaches , but it really depends on the person and whether or not it suits them .","285040":"i ve always had differing tastes of people , so it depends entirely on how they portray themselves . i don t have an ideal image of what someone should look like in order for me to be attracted to them .","285041":"i m in the process of reading you by caroline kepnes .","285042":"i don t foresee myself dating anyone else , at least at this time , so this is a pretty unrealistic hypothetical .","285043":"lol . i wish i was on your level rn . take care of yourself .","285044":"his blatant happiness .","285045":"urlsareshittbh is cute . i admire him and his passion for what he s interested in so much .","285046":"not really , no . i do the same boring things every day , lmaoo .","285047":"attraction is based on more than just whether or not someone has hair on their head .","285048":"it would be interesting to see who all of our anons are for hours . their identities just magically revealed .","285049":"no , i don t believe so .","285050":"not personally , no . i have a friend or two who have been arrested for duis , though .","285051":"if those were true cases in the scenario , then it sounds like he was in a manipulative and ab sive relationship . regardless , even if she did try to trap him , a miscarriage is still a traumatic event and there s no excuse for abandoning someone at the hospital where they ll have no means of getting back home . they d both be wrong in that example .","285052":"it s literally illegal to serve underage people alcohol , and i think arrests are warranted in these situations . there are so many ways to ensure that an id is real the bar i go to , for example , has one of those id scanners they place the id inside and determines whether it s real or fake . obviously not every place will have that sort of technology , but i believe underage drinking is a serious matter because of how normalized alcohol is in today s society .","285053":"i like cheeseburgers with lettuce and tomatoes . i don t like onions or ketchup or pickles or anything else on my burgers .","285054":"new belgium s fat tire or voodoo ranger . i also like yuengling , corona light only with the lime , and montauk s wave chaser ipa . i also drink a lot of local beer since long island has a hell of a lot of breweries , but i can t remember any of their names .","285055":"i feel as if this question is a bit inappropriate for me , at the very least . i m uncomfortable sharing my darkest thoughts because they re quite grotesque and i don t want to implicate myself .","285056":"no , i m not interested in sports .","285057":"i m terrified of places that are alleged to be haunted , haha . i wouldn t want to stay in a haunted house or hotel or anything , even if i was paid money to go there .","285058":"i m just listening to music , answering questions in my inbox , and drinking a beer .","285059":"i haven t been to the store to assess the situation , but there have been suspicions of some cases on long island and they re carefully monitoring everything . upper management at my job sent a company wide email yesterday about taking precautions about the coronavirus and how we re going to all be setting our computers up to work remotely from home if the office building ends up getting shut down .","285060":"i wouldn t wish to live to the age of , regardless of how i looked . that sounds like a terrible existence .","285061":"wow . . . that was such a d ck move on his part to abandon his girlfriend at the hospital ? to not support her i m assuming through a miscarriage , which is normally traumatic ? he sounds like a terrible person . i would have cut him off too . i wouldn t want that sort of person in my life .","285062":"i could never go into a customer service position , where you have to deal with irate customers or clients on a daily basis . i wouldn t be able to emotionally handle that .","285063":"yes , haha . five years isn t much time in the long run , and i would rather be confident in myself than live a longer life where i m absolutely miserable .","285064":"get an actual alarm clock , set it to a particular time , and place it across the room so that you re forced to get out of bed in order to turn the alarm off .","285065":"coffee , haha . it was the only thing keeping me motivated to continue working this morning .","285066":"i think it s silly , but it s a good way for people to receive extra coins , if they care about that sort of thing . i ve never paid coins to view someone s secret answer .","285067":"everyone i know isn t looking forward to it because we lose an hour , but tbh , i m happy about daylight savings because now i don t have to worry about driving home from work in the dark anymore .","285068":"abandonment by my loved ones .","285069":"no , if you re already healthy then wearing a mask won t affect you , and it s better to save those resources for those who are at risk of getting the virus and health care workers . i ve been washing my hands , sneezing into tissues , using hand sanitizer , opening doors with paper towels , etc etc .","285070":"if both partners are supportive of the activity , then i see nothing wrong with it .","285071":"no , it s because i hate my body and don t want to expose to anyone how disgusting i am . lmaoo .","285072":"no , i m not making an onlyfans account .","285073":"i remember reading a few articles about the subject a couple of years ago when i was initially learning about problems within the sex industry .","285074":"i m not exactly sure what your intentions are at this point , but if we re summing up this discussion , i should note that afterwards i discussed consent . there s little consent in terms of porn and prostitution , which is why i made a separate paragraph in my initial response discussing the difference between things like onlyfans porn prostitution .","285075":"the initial question i was asked was about onlyfans sex workers . lol .","285076":"my prior answer was about consent in the sex industry . i ve worked for below minimum wage as well , and i believe i do understand the parallel you re making . but just because the same can be said about every industry doesn t mean that the problems in the sex industry aren t significant too .","285077":"i apologize for giving off that impression , i m definitely not shaming anyone because i have friends who are sex workers and i support their ventures . it s difficult for me to really describe the distinction because like you said , some people use sites like onlyfans to get out of poverty as well . but i think what it comes down to is consent . there s seldom consent involved in sex work like porn or prostitution , meanwhile when people sell pictures and videos , they re giving their own consent to release that content to subscribers unless they re being extorted or something . hopefully this makes it clearer .","285078":"i never said anything about one thing being better than the other . i just said there was a distinction between selling photos videos online from working as a porn actor or a prostitute . a lot of people in the latter professions fell into it for one reason or another and feel as though there s no way out .","285079":"pockets on women s jeans are useless , lmaoo . i can normally never fit anything in them unless i put my phone in my back pocket which i seldom do .","285080":"i agree .","285081":"my three biggest interests are true crime , writing , and video games . i ve been interested in them all for as long as i can remember tbh . i ve always loved writing as a creative outlet and i ve been playing video games since i was young . as for true crime , it developed from a formative intrigue with serial killers and then it grew from there .","285082":"no , i disagree with sweetnothings s views regarding onlyfans sex workers in general . i think people not just women should have the freedom to do what they want with their bodies , including making money off of pictures and videos and whatnot . i m also of the understanding , however , that a lot of people in the porn industry and prostitution don t want to be in those industries , so it s a bit different from people who sell photos videos online . it s still along the lines of sex work , but there s a clear distinction .","285083":"not any busier than any other time of the year .","285084":"mental health illnesses , true crime , video games , television shows , literature , the arts , alcohol , writing , my career education , relationships , etc etc .","285085":"anyone want to ask me questions while i wait for steam to update ? i was going to play stardew valley , but my computer has other priorities it seems .","285086":"i agree with sweetnothings anywhere between the ages of and .","285087":"several different television shows or movies , chocolate and candy in general , and manicures pedicures .","285088":"i m not sure if i believe in the concept of evil , it seems a bit archaic and biblical to me . i believe people have both good and bad in them , it just depends on which side they decide to act upon .","285089":"this question has been my inbox for a solid month , and i can t think of anything else to say besides the trauma i endured when i was a teenager . it obviously isn t the most glamorous of responses , but it s the only thing i could never forget . i have flashbacks on occasion and get so wrapped up in them that i forget where i am , and even though i m not in the same environment anymore , the memories still haunt me .","285090":"thank you i fell back asleep after calling out of work and ended up sleeping for another . hours or so . then i cooked some breakfast , made a pot of coffee , and i ve been on my laptop drinking coffee and listening to relaxing music since then . i might gather up the motivation to play some video games later .","285091":"i m honestly not doing so well . i had a terrible night last night , where i was crying for the majority of the night and then i ended up falling asleep and sleeping through all of my alarms this morning . i woke up feeling horrible , so i decided to call out of work and give myself a mental health day . i m feeling slightly better than i did last night , but i m still rather down and just trying to distract myself .","285092":"from my understanding , capitalism mainly only benefits the wealthy .","285093":"i don t normally watch comedies . but i remember laughing really hard at movies like jump street , get him to the greek , and pineapple express .","285094":"a quality friend is a person who is there for you when you need them most , especially if you re going through a rough time . they ll check up on you occasionally and listen to you when you re upset while giving productive and supportive feedback . at the same time , a quality friend is also a person who will call you out if you re being hurtful or problematic because they have your best interests in mind .","285095":"i never have , and i have no interest in it either .","285096":"i m content with waking up in my home , as long as i could sleep for as much

chainsaw massacre the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring","285098":"i guess my mental illnesses are both a blessing and a curse . it s a curse because i m obviously mentally unstable , and i m prone to episodes of depression and rage , which can lead to me hurting myself . my mood swings are rapid and unpredictable , which is exhausting . however , it s a blessing because it s helped me empathize with other people more who struggle with the same things and i ve become an advocate for mental health awareness and reform .","285099":"i listen to video game instrumental music , like this skyrim ambience one that i m listening to right now https www . youtube . com watch ? v ou pl xnrs t s","285100":"i ve never been to a festival before , and it isn t something i would be interested in doing in the future . there are too many people , too much noise , and no sense of organization i feel like when it comes to festivals . it would make my society anxiety and sensory overload flare up .","285101":"yes , i agree with you , especially in terms of the homeless . a lot of homeless people are mentally ill or even veterans who may have ptsd or other mental disorders , but society views them as inferior to those who are more privileged or better off like having homes , jobs , etc etc . i do think it s disgusting and shameful , and there needs to be more awareness and advocacy on behalf of groups who are more susceptible to mental health problems .","285102":"being wise is having insight in problems and learning to deal with them accordingly . you may reflect upon past issues and use those lessons learned to approach new problems with a different perspective . to be cunning , on the other hand , means to achieve results through manipulative , toxic , or deceitful ways .","285103":"somewhere around hours , from what i remember .","285104":"i feel as if we re advancing in terms of the sciences , medicine , and technology . but as a social group in a sociological psychological aspect , i don t believe we re advancing just remaining stagnant , like you said .","285105":"i don t think that s controlling , no . that s just you trying to set two friends up together because you think they would be compatible . it would be controlling if you insisted upon them getting to know each other if they were resistant to the idea , or if one or both of them weren t looking for a relationship .","285106":"yeah , i delete some questions that don t necessarily apply to me , that are trolling or hate messages , etc etc .","285107":"i don t really celebrate easter

would be able to handle a long distance relationship . i need to see the person i m dating , spend quality time with them in person , etc etc . long distance relationships work for some people , but certainly not all . i require physical intimacy no , not just sex for me to feel loved and comfortable .","285110":"i actually like my bedroom the way it is now . i have paintings , posters , and tapestries on the walls . i have a cute bedside table , a big desk , and a stand for my television . i have blackout curtains for my window so that i don t wake up early every time the sun rises . i have string lights above my bed . it s overall my sanctuary .","285111":"no , that isn t the definition of wisdom to me . i believe wisdom is having the ability to learn from past mistakes and utilize the lessons you ve learned to apply them to future issues .","285112":"i like beef jerky , but i never buy it really because it s stupid expensive .","285113":"depends on how soft the sand is . i like

pop up on your phone every time a friend makes a poll .","285115":"taking a few xanax before bed .","285116":"this view was gorgeous . this was the smoking section of one of the islands in the bahamas

.","285120":"guilty pleasure , although carbs in moderation are okay . i m a sucker for pasta and buttered bread , lmaoo .","285121":"i ve never heard of that person before .","285122":"i need to color my hair again . it got really light after being in the sun and water when i went on vacation .","285123":"i ve been re watching bones and criminal minds lately .","285124":"of course . if you don t have trust in your relationship , then that s a serious problem that you need to work on .","285125":"it depends on the relationship . sometimes they re not growing at the same rate as the other person , or perhaps their priorities don t align anymore . in some cases , it s just a matter of distance and growing apart because interests have changed , or there s a disruption in the chemistry , whether it s emotional or physical .","285126":"no , i never once indicated that , lol . my weight had nothing to do with our breakup .","285127":"i think so ? i m not really sure , i don t know what the ingredients are in cannoli cake , lol . i just know it has cannoli cream filling and mini chocolate chips , which is so delicious .","285128":"yes , she s a bit on the chubbier side .","285129":"i went on vacation two weeks ago for the first time in over years . i don t buy gifts for people unless it s a holiday or their birthday . drinking every week isn t necessarily expensive , i can buy a rack of beer for and it ll last me a while .","285130":"i m not from new york city . regardless , it s an ideal tourist attraction but completely terrible to actually live in .","285131":"i think you meant to type ex boyfriend . regardless , we have similar features but obviously we re different .","285132":"appearances can be deceiving .","285133":"unfortunately , that isn t my decision to make . in addition , a few of our kind have been kidnapped by earthlings in a desolate location which we believe to be named area , and our priorities are recovering our fellow brethren .","285134":"lol . i ll consult the authorities and inform them that we need better disguises prior to our earthly takeover .","285135":"no , that s just manipulative ab sive .","285136":"quite the opposite , actually . i m respectful toward others , as long as they return the same sentiment .","285137":"you caught me i m actually an extraterrestrial in disguise .","285138":"lol , no . it s just ridiculous and irrational to assume someone would go so far as to m rder someone over something so insignificant .","285139":". . . wtf .","285140":"her and i have never talked about that we ve only met on a few occasions in social settings . regardless , that isn t a conversation i would have with her because it seems a bit inappropriate .","285141":"yeah , my face has the tendency to be fairly emotionless , even when i m upset . it s natural for me to hide my emotions because i don t want to be a burden on anyone else .","285142":"well , i still love him but i m also concerned about his own happiness . i m not wishing for his current relationship to end because that would make him unhappy , but if that does wind up happening , i would probably be willing to give him a second chance under certain conditions .","285143":"this isn t true there are plenty of drugstore makeup products that are high quality and are healthy for you , while there are also higher end makeup products which are lower quality and not necessarily as healthy for you . you re essentially just paying for a brand name that s recognizable . additionally , self respect has nothing to do with the amount of money someone does or does not have . you cannot assume someone has no money or is broke simply because they use drugstore makeup .","285144":"uh , my ex isn t married . lmaoo .","285145":"i had an emo phase and a scene phase , since i was in middle school and high school in the early s .","285146":"yes , that is quite rude and pretty classist as well . there s nothing wrong with using drugstore makeup products .","285147":"i don t answer questions of a sexual nature .","285148":"yes , that s completely common and normal . when people get older , it s natural to become distant from old friends because we re all our pursuing our own lives separate from who we were when we were younger .","285149":"why would i be creating a problem ? if she had a problem with me , she would have confronted me or him directly .","285150":"yes , we ve hung out on a few occasions .","285151":"it s fairly rare , but it s completely possible . when a panic attack occurs , people often become very dizzy and lightheaded , so it could potentially lead to someone fainting . i ve never fainted myself , but i ve definitely felt close to it because of how bad the panic attack was .","285152":"no , that isn t the reason why we re friends . we re friends because neither of us can imagine a life without the other person in it , and we simply wish to remain friends because we ve always had a great friendship , even prior to our relationship . it isn t something either of us want to lose .","285153":"if i had a dollar for every time someone has said this to me , i would be quite wealthy .","285154":"before i was on medication , yes . i was terrified to leave the house , and also due to my depression , i did not have the motivation to leave my house either . i wouldn t say that i could have been diagnosed with agoraphobia because i did leave the house to go to work , but other than that , i stayed home .","285155":"no , we re still friends . i value our friendship i don t know what i would do if we cut ties completely .","285156":"no , it isn t a habit . it s just a feeling that comes goes depending on my mood .","285157":"thank you .","285158":"i m not quite sure what you mean by this question . i have habits , but nothing is in relation to my former relationship .","285159":"they really do , i m grateful for the few friends i have who have helped me endure this , as well as the support from a few coworkers of mine with whom i m close .","285160":"we re still friends , so we talk about the breakup every so often and he always reassures me that nothing was my fault . however , i do still blame myself to some degree when i m feeling down , because i wonder if there s something i could have done differently to save the relationship .","285161":"aw , thank you so much . it s obviously been really hard on me , but i ve been surviving and basically focusing on work , my friends , and my hobbies .","285162":"you can t put a time frame on moving on from someone you once dated . everyone has a different method of moving on , and everyone gets over people at different rates . i don t know how long it will take me to move forward , if i even do at all , so i m just taking each day at a time .","285163":"the three cups of coffee i had this morning , as well as feeling productive when i finished up my freelance work earlier .","285164":"of course i still love him .","285165":"it doesn t hurt me , no . i care about his happiness , and while i wish that it was me , i also know that he s doing what s best for himself and that s all that i can ask .","285166":"no , he s been dating someone .","285167":"years .","285168":"to a certain degree , yes . however , i ve been trying to focus more on the present moment because living in the past and dwelling on the what ifs is unhealthy .","285169":"thank you , i really appreciate it . obviously i m not feeling the best but i have both good days and bad , and today i feel relatively stable .","285170":"yeah , it was partially the reason why i felt comfortable sharing my breakup on askfm .","285171":"i received this same exact message yesterday . no , you cannot contact me on instagram or any other forms of social media . if you wish to ask me questions , you can do so here on askfm .","285172":"i m not really sure what you mean by cross the line ? regardless , there has been no cheating involved . we re respecting each other s boundaries .","285173":"in a heartbeat , but under certain conditions . he would have to be sure about his feelings towards me and be willing to do this for the long run . i m sure he s still confused about his feelings at the moment but hasn t spoken to me about them directly , probably because he doesn t want me to get my hopes up and not move on .","285174":"they re not the same thing , no . there was no sense of intimacy towards the end , and we acted more like friends than anything else because he wasn t in love with me anymore , and honestly he almost felt obligated to be with me because he was afraid of what i would do if he broke up with me . but he couldn t ignore or deny his feelings because he simply wasn t the happiest that he could be with me , and he does deserve to find someone who will make him happy . we re not in a relationship anymore , but we re still friends . just because we re not in a relationship anymore doesn t mean that things haven t changed . everything has changed .","285175":"i m not angry at him , no . like i said he didn t do anything wrong , he was open about his feelings , and we tried everything we could to fix the situation but he couldn t just ignore how he was feeling . i still love him , and i probably will for a long time . i m sad more than anything else that things didn t work out , but we re still friends and i m grateful that he s still in my life because i don t know what i would do without his friendship .","285176":"that is indeed true , but she made it seem like he did something wrong when he didn t actually do anything wrong . people fall out of love it s common . she didn t really talk about or ask about how i was feeling about it , and that s why she apologized afterwards .","285177":"my best friend said good , you deserve better anyway , which pissed me off a little bit until she thought about what she said and apologized for not taking my own feelings into consideration . everyone else has been rather supportive , though .","285178":"no problem ! ! i ve always enjoyed your answers .","285179":"i love everyone i follow , but these people seem to be the most active on a regular basis shehitsback kittiemeowsie astoldbyjoanna asgardarts fauxkitten","285180":"in a way , yes . they never treated me well or with respect , and they even went so far as to ab se me while i was growing up and all the way into my teenage years . i haven t forgiven them and i don t think i ever will .","285181":"i try to buy organic food as often as possible , yeah .","285182":"yes , there are some ex friends of mine whom i ve outgrown over the years after i got over the whole partying stage of my life . we simply did not have the same mindsets or goals anymore .","285183":"i ve created multiple tumblr accounts in the past , going as far back as . i don t currently have one , though .","285184":"the last song i sang somebody you loved by lewis capaldi . poem i wrote i don t remember what i titled it , but it was about love and loss and i wrote it last year . dream i dreamed i had a dream that the bartender was hitting on me last night , lmaoo .","285185":"both ? haha . in the morning , i usually eat parfaits with fruit in them or oatmeal .","285186":"i like anon questions as long as they re respectful . i actually welcome anons , it s a nice change from the regular spam i receive from people like yourself on a regular basis .","285187":"no , i never learned how to roller skate .","285188":"i don t like sports , but i ve been to an ice hockey game once .","285189":"i ve considered it , but i don t believe that i would ever go through with it .","285190":"thank you","285191":"it was fun ! ! it was just me and my roommate , though , everyone else bailed on us , haha . and no , i have no desire to have a one night stand .","285192":"i believe that s normal , yes . you can break up with someone for whatever reason and still miss them because you miss what you had together , especially if you ve realized things wouldn t work in the future . as for texting , it depends on what you re texting them and why . they need a chance to move on as much as you do .","285193":"aw , thank you .","285194":"going out drinking tonight","285195":"apparently you don t know the meaning of private .","285196":"no , my instagram is private .","285197":"you re writing me now .","285198":"as my bio indicates , i m non binary .","285199":"work is my main motivation to get up in the morning . i don t love my job , but it s definitely the best job i ve ever had thus far . and i like going into work and feeling very productive most days . also , coffee is a strong motivation of mine . i wouldn t consider myself to really be strong , especially lately . i m just going through the motions and seeing what happens on a daily basis . i m taking each day at a time .","285200":"i never have before , and i m not sure if i would be willing to try it .","285201":"pretty sure buildings literally cannot be built that tall . the empire state building , for example , is only , feet tall or so . i ve been to the top of the empire state building and it was exhilarating , however .","285202":"like , the meyer briggs personality types ? infj .","285203":"anyone want to ask me questions ? i have some stuff in my inbox , but i don t feel like answering them . any topic is fine , i just don t answer questions of a s xual nature and i delete hate , trolling , etc etc .","285204":"moving out of my parents house into my own place , especially when i was in such a bad mindset at the time . it s probably the best thing i could have done for myself . i think it s a dumb accomplishment , mainly because people move out of their parents house all the time and it isn t really anything too special . but it s been so important for my mental health .","285205":"perhaps i m misunderstanding the question a bit , but i think being a part of someone may be a bit unhealthy . you should ideally be your own person outside of your relationship , not that you re a part of someone else s identity .","285206":"i have zero materials too , haha . i would just need to buy a tent and a sleeping bag or an inflatable mattress , or something . the rest of my friends have pretty much everything else . i wouldn t buy anything until a date is set in stone , i don t even know if a camping trip will happen but it s something we ve been talking about .","285207":"i ve never been camping before , no . i ve always wanted to try it , however ! ! it seems like a lot of fun .","285208":"yes , he feels the same . he doesn t want me out of his life either and he considers me his closest friend .","285209":"i m not interested in dating .","285210":"get another promotion at work . get back into photography . read more books . go camping with my friends . start exercising again .","285211":"thank you so much , friend . i truly appreciate it .","285212":"i wish i knew how to sing well . music is one of my passions , and i think i would have pursued music as a career if i could sing .","285213":"i used to take a multi vitamin , but i haven t taken them in a while even though i probably should get back to it . i didn t really notice a difference in my health .","285214":"you can follow me if you d like . but i have no intentions of following you considering most of your answers are in a language i cannot understand .","285215":"i m not worried about the coronavirus , haha . at least for myself personally it may become an epidemic in the united states soon enough but i m healthy and there s a low risk of me contracting it .","285216":"yeah , we broke up a few months ago . it s all right obviously i m not doing great , but i have both good and bad days and i find it s been best for me to distract myself with work and my hobbies and being with my friends .","285217":"no , has been miserable so far . granted , the end of was also relatively bad considering the breakup , but has been terrible because i ve been sick for half of the past two months and my ex s dog was put down . the cruise was a nice distraction and vacation from everyday life , but it was difficult to come back to reality when i returned home , haha .","285218":"waking up early and having a cup of coffee at my desk while i play video games or browse social media . doing some easy household chores to make myself feel productive . perhaps going out to brunch or day drinking with a close friend but not to the point of oblivion , lol . taking a walk through the park with my camera and taking in all of the nature and elements . playing video games at the end of the night and going to bed at a reasonable hour so that i can get a full night s rest .","285219":"i can t envision myself five months from now , let alone five years from now . everything is so up in the air and unexpected .","285220":"i never thought i would have the opportunity to go on a cruise before . i never thought i would be renting a house with my friends . and i also never thought that i would actually find a job in my field where my writing has been distributed both online and in print .","285221":"my self doubt holds me back from being more successful than i actually am , at the moment . i m constantly questioning myself , and lately i ve been allowing other people to somewhat take the reins instead of making independent decisions myself .","285222":"my favorite songs always change , but lately they ve been to die for by sam smith . somebody you loved by lewis capaldi . peaches by grandson k . flay . ocean eyes by billie eilish . die for you by starset .","285223":"my ability to express complex thoughts and emotions into the written word .","285224":"i honestly don t know anymore . i ve been trying not to think so deeply into things like that because i feel as if my life is almost meaningless most days .","285225":"linkin park , hands down . i ve seen them quite a few times in concert prior to chester bennington s passing , and they were the best concerts of my life .","285226":"yes , one of my better qualities is my loyalty and ability to keep secrets of my friends .","285227":"i would like to believe so , yes . this time last year , i didn t have as much responsibility or leverage at my job , and i ve gained two promotions since that time . personally speaking , i don t really remember what i was like one year ago , so i can t really say much to that .","285228":"it s all right . i only woke up minutes ago , though . i just made a pot of coffee and i ve been sitting down and doing some freelance work for my job this morning .","285229":"the piano is one of my favorite instruments , especially since it s so versatile . i would choose the piano however , i also love the sounds of a violin , they re equally as beautiful .","285230":"they re aesthetically pleasing to look at , but i don t wear acrylic nails . i keep mine bare most of the time .","285231":"i ve always considered the carolinas or virginia as an option , or perhaps massachusetts , new hampshire , or vermont .","285232":"i seldom ask people questions , and when i do , they re only to whom i follow .","285233":"life is too short to deny yourself simple pleasures . it s okay to treat yourself and do things that make you happy within moderation . we don t know when our lives will end , so we should ideally live every day with our best interests in mind .","285234":"my roommate and i go grocery shopping every two weeks , and it usually comes out to around depending on what we need .","285235":"when you love the idea of someone , you re not in love with the actual person and you realize you re unhappy when you re actually around them or they continue to disappoint you . being actually in love with someone means loving them wholeheartedly , including their flaws , and being enamored with the time you do spend together , whether it s physical presence or just talking to them .","285236":"right now , the pizza i m about to eat , an ice cold beer , and my bed .","285237":"i don t know what that is .","285238":"no , i m in love with him . i know what it feels like to love the idea of someone and this is completely different .","285239":"from my understanding , the people who are getting sick dying from coronavirus have compromised immune systems , are young , or are elderly .","285240":"no , there s a low risk of me contracting it .","285241":"no , if there s something independent i want to say i just use the random question generator .","285242":"i ve never even heard of those before ! ! that sounds perfect . and probably much cheaper than a caribbean cruise , lmaoo .","285243":"texting and in person .","285244":"i m not sure if i do , i don t think i ll do another day cruise like the one i just did . it seemed almost too long , especially since out of the days we were just cruising the ocean and couldn t leave the ship .","285245":"my sick tan lines when i was on the cruise , haha .","285246":"plot twist i always want to go to sleep .","285247":"i didn t think that was a new thing ? i ve had cherry vanilla coke in the past and it was pretty good . i m not really a soda person , though .","285248":"i m sorry you re going through this . you re going to ultimately have to decide what you want to do with the relationship either forgive her , or end the relationship completely . being cheated on isn t something that should be taken lightly and it s normal for you to feel distraught .","285249":"grocery shopping and doing my taxes . how exciting","285250":"i m not sure what there is to do , i m not an expert on the subject .","285251":"i m sure it was one of the main reasons , yeah . i m not really doing so well i have good days and bad days , and most of my bad days happen in the evening when i have nothing to occupy my time . during working hours , i m relatively okay since my mind is busy .","285252":"i used to love the mario games when i was younger , yes . i don t have any merchandise from the games , but it was essentially a staple of my childhood because i developed an interest in video games at an early age .","285253":"sushi , veggie burrito bowls , hummus , cheeseburgers , halal food , chicken parm , jerk chicken , picadillo , etc etc .","285254":"i think a better way to phrase this would be not dealing with the coronavirus , haha . apparently the government doesn t think it s a threat , despite the cdc saying otherwise . which i think is foolish , because it s only a matter of time before there s also an epidemic in other countries .","285255":"yeah , many times . i m not the biggest fan of bowling , though .","285256":"sweatpants and a tank top .","285257":"not very often , thankfully . it s always in my pocket .","285258":"i can t fall asleep with the television on , it only keeps me up more .","285259":"i m looking forward to staying home and sleeping in , lmaoo . i don t have plans except grocery shopping .","285260":"it depends on the relationship . sometimes it helps , sometimes it hurts .","285261":"i believe i m mature enough for my age , yes .","285262":"sometimes i ll reach out and just say hi , i won t tell him i miss him or anything because i don t want to put him in a weird position . other times i ll just distract myself with television , books , and video games .","285263":"i want another promotion at work and perhaps go camping and more photography excursions , but other than that , no .","285264":"my close friend .","285265":"no , he would just say he didn t feel like talking and needed time alone . it would be the same if we were together at times too , we would just sit in silence sometimes but it wasn t that comfortable silence that we used to experience in happier times .","285266":"both . i didn t know if i was being too clingy , so sometimes i let it go , haha . i didn t want to appear smothering or overbearing .","285267":"you only see the anons i post . the hate messages get deleted .","285268":"depends on who i m around , but generally yes . i only have a close circle of friends and i m always honest and open with them regarding my feelings and life circumstances . it hurts me more than anything to keep things hidden away within me .","285269":"yeah , we broke up in september .","285270":"yes , they re aware of it as well as the fact that he s currently dating someone .","285271":"somewhat , but not really . like i said , i still love him . that feeling overpowers everything else despite everything .","285272":"there s a difference between being comfortable and being stagnant . when i say stagnant , i mean that there wasn t much excitement anymore , we didn t go anywhere together anymore , etc etc . even two years back , we were going on vacations and to the park and out to dinner and then it slowly dwindled and stopped , and all we really did was hang out and watch youtube together .","285273":"of course , we both did . but you cannot control your feelings , and i can t make him love me when his feelings were not there anymore . we had to learn to accept it .","285274":"no , my mental health prevented it from appearing easy at all . it s been months and i still break down crying every now and again , perhaps times per week and especially when i m listening to music . i just keep thinking about what could i have done better ? or what went wrong ? even though he s reassured me a thousand times that i did nothing wrong and he still values me greatly as a close friend .","285275":"no , we didn t fight at all actually . there wasn t any conflict between us , we just kinda existed together , if that makes sense . even though i ve been progressing in my own personal and professional life , as well as he in his professional life , that doesn t necessarily mean the relationship got stronger .","285276":"they ve been in settings where i was drinking heavily , so . . . lmaoo .","285277":"yes , i m still very much in love .","285278":"i m still in love with him , so no . but i understood that he needed distance and i didn t want to force him to hang out when i knew he needed alone time . like i stated yesterday , the relationship just grew stagnant and it felt like we weren t growing together anymore .","285279":"probably , lmaoo . i ve been very unstable ever since the breakup despite taking my medication every day .","285280":"i m happy that he seems happy in his current position , and i m not jealous of him or her at all . i still care about his happiness , and yes i do wish it was still me . but there s no use in feeling jealous because it s a toxic emotion and it will only hurt me .","285281":"about two months or so , i believe ? so it s evident that they were talking , but he didn t cheat on me and i think his feelings developing for her was a catalyst that made him realize he wasn t in love with me anymore .","285282":"i ve hung out with her a few times , yes . she s honestly a hilarious person , and i can relate to her a lot . we struggle with a lot of the same things .","285283":"we both grew a bit distant from each other and started seeing each other less , and i think that was his way of processing his feelings to know whether or not him falling out of me was actually happening or not . his actual behavior didn t change , but our chemistry did .","285284":"they ve known each other for about a year . and no , it isn t awkward at all like i said , my ex and i are still friends and there s no animosity between us at all . we all hang out together on occasion .","285285":"it was a long time coming , and we finally had an opportunity to sit down and have the time to talk sincerely and deeply about our relationship with no interruptions . it just came up in conversation because we both felt the difference , and it needed to be addressed . obviously i was very upset , but things like this massive life changes , etc etc . don t really hit me until days or weeks after the fact , so i was numb to it for a long time .","285286":"lmfao , to be fair i think everyone is more attractive than me . but yeah , she s pretty and she s our age .","285287":"no , i have no desire to start dating .","285288":"the fact that we re not dating anymore ? lol . feelings change it happens , and people fall out of love or grow out of them after a while . it s an unfortunate part of life , and as unexpected as it was , i can t do anything but accept it for what it is .","285289":"he already has . like i said , this happened months ago and i ve just been not talking about it on social media at all . it isn t a break up that happened recently .","285290":"work was on my mind most of the day for obvious reasons , but now that i m home , i m planning on playing stardew valley for a few hours .","285291":"i eat muffins occasionally , and blueberry is my favorite .","285292":"no , i haven t done that . that seems pretty rude , tbh .","285293":"depends on the man , haha . some men are more attractive with and some are more attractive without , and levels of attraction vary because everyone has a different taste .","285294":"yes , i don t regret anything about the relationship at all . he s helped me in so many different ways .","285295":"yeah , we re still friends . we don t see each other very often , but we text nearly every day .","285296":"i m not going to lie i ve come pretty close , and my coping mechanisms haven t exactly been the healthiest , which i m also ashamed to say . it s just natural for me to hide it , and i do it extremely well . . . almost too well . thank you , i appreciate it .","285297":"i honestly don t know . there s still a large part of me holding out hope , but i know that isn t healthy and i should try to focus on myself instead of a relationship that has already ended . i m taking each day at a time , focusing my feelings on my friends and career , and spending time delving into my hobbies to make the time pass . at the bottom of my heart , i want things to be different and us to get back together , but that isn t reality right now .","285298":"he fell out of love with me we were stagnant , our relationship wasn t really going anywhere . and as much as he tells me it isn t my fault and i did everything i could , he says that he doesn t think he can love me to the same extent that i love him . i m not really sure how he feels , despite him saying that . but i do believe it is best for us to spend some time apart , if anything to figure out our feelings because we were stagnant for so long . i was just terrified of things ending because of mental illness things , i didn t want to lose him and that s why i kept holding on so desperately .","285299":"i did , i went with him and his family . we made these plans last spring , way prior to the breakup . everything was already paid for , and we re still on good terms , so i figured it wouldn t necessarily be a bad thing if i turned down the trip last minute . and regardless of the break up , the cruise was hella fun . it s just bittersweet .","285300":"yeah , it s weird how things like this have been happening for a lot of people i know , especially my online friends .","285301":"i m going to be brutally honest here i m currently in this situation , and it is terrifying . it s heart wrenching . i ve been at the lowest of the lows and it takes so much for me to drag myself out of bed in the morning , knowing what i had is now lost . and i don t know if i can ever get it back . my boyfriend and i broke up , a few months ago . i ve been hiding the breakup on askfm because i didn t want to deal with the backlash from anons and the snotty comments , but comments like these and learning of my friends from askfm breaking up with their partners makes me feel more confident to finally say this out loud , outside of my small circle of irl friends . so , yeah . i understand exactly how you feel . he s still my favorite person . we re still friends . and it hurts more than anything has ever hurt before .","285302":"neither . i would rather be an anti hero . someone who does morally questionable things for a greater cause , kind of like a vigilante .","285303":"i m not doing well tonight . i m thinking of having a liquid dinner , tbh .","285304":"i am not a parent , so i have zero thoughts on the matter .","285305":"within reason , sure . i m nice to those who are nice to me , but i m often cautious of people until i begin to trust them so i ll keep my distance .","285306":"skin picking dermatillomania , that would be the biggest one . it s a terrible habit and my skin is littered with wounds and scars .","285307":"i eat both fish and meat , so i don t really prefer one over the other . it really depends on my mood that day .","285308":"my only exceptions would be perhaps meth and heroin , like i ve stated earlier sometime yesterday , i believe . i have too many personal experiences with people overdosing on those drugs , and nothing good can come of legalizing such dangerous drugs , especially considering how cheap they already are anyway .","285309":"new jersey to the bahamas via a cruise ship just over , miles .","285310":"i don t do anything to maintain my hair . i just wash it , condition it , and put in argan oil after i ve washed my hair before it dries .","285311":"for the most part , i agree with sweetnothings . although i do not believe all drugs should be legalized , i do agree with her opinion that addiction should be treated as a disease which is what addiction actually is . people who are addicts are often thrown in prison for possession , etc etc . , and they re not given proper help for their addiction , which only increases the rate of recidivism in the community . addiction is a health care concern , and money should be allocated towards rehabilitative purposes to better treat drug addicts so that they can recover .","285312":"i care about both , but moreso my physical appearance these days . i ve been really unhappy with how i ve been looking which isn t unusual , just more intense now .","285313":"i ve only ever eaten sushi with chopsticks , haha .","285314":"i prefer using askfm on my computer as opposed to the phone . it s easier to me to type on my laptop than on my phone , especially considering my answers are normally on the longer side .","285315":"a hot drink i m currently drinking a cup of hot coffee rn , actually . i also don t like physical affection with most people .","285316":"you would have to ask your partner it could mean either thing depending on the individual , and the only way you ll know if they re breaking up with you is if you ask them directly .","285317":"i was doing fine while i was at work since my mind was being kept busy , but now that i m home , i m pretty sad .","285318":"according to cadence s page , she hasn t posted anything in days . regardless , if svspicion had an issue with my thoughts , she would simply tell me herself .","285319":"it s illegal , but that doesn t stop people from doing them . if you re going to choose to do drugs then it s better if you re in a safe environment and do them in moderation .","285320":"not only happiness and contentment with yourself in general , but also the journey you take to pursue that tranquility and acceptance within yourself .","285321":"i m never around elderly people , so i don t have the opportunity to listen to their stories or advice . i don t believe it s something i would be interested in , though .","285322":"i prefer answering personalized questions about my life , particularly about my job or education , my hobbies , mental health , etc etc . i also like being asked opinion questions , even controversial ones .","285323":"no , my memory is honestly terrible and it only gets worse as i age .","285324":"raising awareness of mental health and advocating for mental health reform is one of my top priorities and passions , so it s very important to me .","285325":"i used to know how to play chess rather well when i was much younger , but i haven t played in many years so i don t think i remember how .","285326":"i have an anxiety disorder , so basically everything makes me nervous .","285327":"oh please . if you truly believe i m going to answer questions of this nature , you evidently don t know me .","285328":"yeah , i ve had acai bowls on occasion in the past . it s pretty delicious .","285329":"everyone has the freedom to experiment with drugs , as long as they re doing it safely and in moderation . obviously this excludes horribly addictive and lethal drugs such as meth or heroin , though . drugs won t make you get to know yourself , though . most people honestly just use drugs to mask their own feelings for a temporary period of time .","285330":"i have to go to the bank on friday to take out money for rent . it s a quick , minute thing , but it s just annoying because i hate making stops on my way home from work .","285331":"i would consider myself to be open minded , but i also know that there is always more to learn .","285332":"yes , i have the tendency to be very romantic at times . more than anything , i enjoy having intimate conversations with my partner and spending quality time together .","285333":"bold of you to assume i use onlyfans .","285334":"i have the capacity to be quite friendly in situations that warrant it , yes .","285335":"when someone is fake , they re essentially pretending to be something or someone they are not in order to appease the masses , particularly on social media such as their followers .","285336":"everyone that i ve been interested in over the years have looked completely different , so i ve never really had a type . i also don t place too much emphasis on physical looks , especially since when i m attracted to someone s personality , their physical looks become even more attractive to me anyway .","285337":"hello do you have a question ?","285338":"i ve been cheated on once although i do have suspicions that my ex cheated on me too . i ve never cheated on anyone before .","285339":"no , most asmr videos actually irritate me .","285340":"making a murderer on netflix was pretty good if you re into true crime .","285341":"it s one of the more reliable sources of news , especially in terms of politics , so occasionally i ll visit their website to read up on things .","285342":"menthol and blue raspberry , considering those are the flavors of the vape juice i smoke every day . lmaoo . but in all seriousness , i honestly have no idea . i wear body spray occasionally , but it changes depending on my mood .","285343":"i don t believe in karma , so no . regardless , this isn t the first time i ve had car issues , haha . it happens every now and again . i ve been driving for almost years , after all .","285344":"most definitely ! ! there were so many things to do on the cruise ship itself , as well as four course dinners every night that was included in the cruise price , so it was well worth the money i spent on everything .","285345":"no , not really . it was a lot of fun , but i wouldn t call it my happy place . the beach is beautiful , but i m more of a woodsy person .","285346":"hello i m doing well , although not looking forward to going back to work tomorrow , haha . i m just about to go to bed considering it s pm and i need to be up early tomorrow .","285347":"i don t have patience with children in general .","285348":"perhaps followers that i m already friends with , yes .","285349":"anyone use steam ? i just logged back in after not playing for , like . . . four years . i m debating on downloading stardew valley .","285350":"hm , interesting .","285351":"i don t follow people upon request , and i seldom ask people questions .","285352":"nah , i ve never played call of duty but i ve watched countless other people play the game . i m not a big fan of online multiplayer games like that , especially considering i m usually terrible at them .","285353":"where did i go wrong ?","285354":"as of last week , the bahamas . i was born and raised in the united states .","285355":"duality basically means there are two parts of opposites . when i think about music in terms of duality , it can both comfort me and make me inquire about my life . it s an all encompassing feeling that is also set apart in opposites because music can be so different from song to song , artist to artist , genre to genre .","285356":"i ve actually never seen any star wars movies before .","285357":"i got my first tattoo a week after i turned . it s a yin yang on my back with the two dots for bass clef symbols . for me , it represents the duality of music and how it s a balancing force in my life .","285358":"yeah , it happened to me the other day . i said something to the extent of how have you been ? and i looked at the word been and it just . . . looked so weird to me after a while . i questioned if i even spelled it right .","285359":"if you look at a word long enough , any word will seem weird and bizarre to you .","285360":"nah , i haven t purchased an actual magazine since i was a teenager , lol .","285361":"apparently , leigh means delicate weary meadow or pasture . i think it does suit me to an extent i m delicate in my emotions , and i do find passion and comfort in nature , such as meadows or pastures .","285362":"hello . no , i have no intention or desire to vote on your photo poll .","285363":"eh , this is difficult for me to answer because i have a personality disorder . but i find that certain aspects of being a scorpio i was born mid november resonate with me , especially when it comes to loyalty and being passionate about things in my life .","285364":"most of the cruise was just cruising in the ocean unfortunately , and i only spent days in the actual bahamas . we visited nassau , bahamas , and spent time at blue lagoon island . then we went to the cruise s private island on the second day . i spent the entire time on the beach , haha . i also had the opportunity to play with stringrays , and that was a lot of fun . the guides taught us about them , how to hold and comfort them , etc etc .","285365":"i have zero clue , tbh . askfm is for asking answering questions , nothing more . there are other sites and apps specifically for dating and hookup purposes , haha .","285366":"ah , i m sorry you re going through this . i think it really depends on the person s own personality and what they re into and how they generally handle hardships . i ve only been through one bad breakup in my life , but i found that delving into my hobbies helped a lot . i wrote a lot , painted a lot , etc etc . i also listened to a lot of music that helped me identify how i felt . also , having a strong support system like friends or family helps significantly . don t feel guilty to rely on them for the time being .","285367":"no , he s light skinned . his father is darker than him , but because he s only half cuban his mother was italian , he has a lighter skin tone .","285368":"yes , i know quite a few people who don t get nearly enough credit as they should . they re all hard workers who put into everything they do , but they re constantly put down or face hardship despite everything they ve worked for .","285369":"i would like to see more understanding and progress reform towards mental health , especially in social and clinical settings .","285370":"i don t think i believe in life after death , although my beliefs do correspond with some sort of life . simply put , i believe our souls live on after our physical bodies have perished . i believe that these souls cannot be destroyed because they re composed of energy , and they get transferred to a different medium , whether it s somewhere out in the universe or on our own planet .","285371":"self doubt and an inkling of an inability to move on .","285372":"somewhat , yeah . he s light skinned compared to other cubans .","285373":"i don t distribute coins to anyone , especially to those who blatantly ask for coins to complete strangers .","285374":"sliders are delicious ! ! i normally just eat the regular cheeseburger sliders with just cheese on it and maybe lettuce and tomato .","285375":"i m mostly a homebody , haha . ever since i moved into the new house , i ve really enjoyed staying home and taking in the silence . it s comforting to me . however , traveling is also extremely fun and i seldom get to travel , so when i do it s an exhilarating experience . i just came home from an day cruise to the bahamas , which was most definitely an interesting and life changing experience .","285376":"i went to an art show a few months ago and purchased a pin from a local artist that says femme and fluid . i thought it described me fairly well , and i think it would be great to have on a tee shirt . i also like the phrase recovery is not linear with respect to mental health .","285377":"probably my laptop . it has all of my work files and resumes , as well as pictures that i ve taken over the years .","285378":"yes , i have a pewter necklace with a tree engraved on it , and on the back it says head in the clouds , roots in the earth .","285379":"can we talk about how gorgeous my new desktop background is ?","285380":"not to my knowledge , haha .","285381":"no , i m overweight and would like to lose perhaps pounds .","285382":"she sounds like she s a bit insecure about her own weight but obviously i don t know this woman , so i can t say for certain . people s insecurities about their bodies are valid , and instead of reassuring her that weight doesn t matter , you should politely inquire what about her body she desires to change and then perhaps help her achieve her goals .","285383":"no , i don t have any children .","285384":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","285385":"a little bit , but not much and it turned into a tan within hours . i used a sunscreen with spf for a change , haha .","285386":"that s good ! ! it isn t even something i ve ever considered before . i don t even remember the last time i wore a bandaid anyway , lmaoo . i usually just leave the wound open to the air because i heal faster that way probably isn t the healthiest thing to do , but whatever .","285387":"lol , it s all good . i used to be the same way . i enjoy thought out answers and elaborate thoughts .","285388":"nah , not really . there are a few songs i enjoy , but overall i don t go out of my way to listen to country music .","285389":"sitting in the sunshine on a tropical island with a cocktail in my hand is pretty heavenly to me .","285390":"my ultimate ambition is to help other people struggling with various obstacles , i . e . mental illness , through my own poetry and non fictional essays . i want to aid in other people s understanding of mental health through my writing .","285391":"don t compromise yourself for the sake of anyone else s happiness . if your friends , family , and or partner truly love and care about you , they wouldn t put you in a position where you would feel the need to lessen yourself or your own happiness just for their own sake .","285392":"i would pay off all of my debt and put a down payment on a house .","285393":"take the time to educate yourself on their diagnoses and ask questions . the best way to fully understand your partner s mental health is to become totally invested in their symptoms and behavior , what triggers them and what comforts them , etc etc . there are so many resources online and books to gain a higher understanding of the mechanisms behind most mental illnesses , and it s best to remain as educated as possible . also , always try to be there for them and validate their concerns when needed and as much as you can . an important part of mental health recovery is having a strong support system , and you should be able to provide them with unconditional support within reason , i . e . unless they re exhibiting problematic behaviors .","285394":"i have fairly unhealthy coping mechanisms that i ve been working on for quite a while , however sometimes i drink alcohol in excess to quell my anger or smoke marijuana . my healthier coping mechanisms include listening to music and venting to friends about what has made me so angry .","285395":"i m very much a fan of dark humor , or things that are borderline controversial . i believe that life shouldn t be taken as seriously as it currently is , and it s fine to poke fun at certain things obviously not everything if you re in the right position to do so .","285396":"urlsareshittbh his answers are always so magnificently worded and on point , and he also takes the time to fully elaborate on his opinions and perspectives on the world . i always enjoy reading his answers .","285397":"i ve never considered this notion before , but i do believe that it could be . i rarely ever see anyone practice calligraphy , and i only have one friend well , she s an acquaintance at this point who was interested in it .","285398":"travel to europe and visit such countries as england , ireland , spain , france , italy , etc etc .","285399":"yes , i believe art can have multiple purposes depending upon the intention of the artist .","285400":"the power of unconditional love and friendship . the value of communication and trust in all sorts of relationships , both romantic and platonic . the healing powers of music and art . the sense of spirituality and freedom you feel from being immersed in nature .","285401":"to preface this , i personally wouldn t agree to make a choice between two friends and would likely either remain civil with both of them , or cut them both off completely . i think it s incredibly manipulative for a person to force you to choose between them or someone else . however , for the sake of answering the question , i think i would weigh the pros and cons of each person s personality and who i connect with better , have better times together , and in general who serves me better in my own pursuit of happiness . i would look to see if either of them have any problematic viewpoints or behaviors that would lead to betrayal or sadness in the long run , and then go from there . in all honesty , you shouldn t be friends with a person whose presence doesn t fulfill you .","285402":"your opinion is irrelevant to this conversation .","285403":"if you knew me at all , you would know that i don t answer questions of this nature .","285404":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","285405":"seeing loved ones laugh or smile . forests with expansive greenery and tall trees . the beach with rolling waves at sunset . classical music , particularly piano and violin pieces . art in general , especially mixed media works and oil paintings .","285406":"you and hidden bodies by caroline kepnes . i started reading you on the cruise and got about halfway through it , and it s really intense . it s actually a bit different and better than the television show the one on netflix . you get real insight into each character because the descriptions take their time instead of being rushed , and even though i know what happens at the end of the story , i m still enjoying it .","285407":"the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring . it s honestly just a fantastic film , and one of my all time favorites . the acting , scenery , special effects , and range of emotions are superb and you automatically get sucked into the storyline .","285408":"i m mostly a clean organized person unless i m going through a depressive episode .","285409":"yes , i believe there is some good in everyone but also some bad as well . it entirely depends upon which side of yourself you act upon .","285410":"i m not entirely sure , actually . it would ideally be pleasant to have no more hardship in life but at the same time , hardship and obstacles are what make us stronger and more versatile , wiser even . we learn from our hardships and mistakes even though they may hurt us or other people , and it makes us more well rounded .","285411":"without a doubt , yes . i would absolutely be willing to relocate to a distant location with my loved one , even if it meant not seeing my friends or family often at all . i m not close with my family by any means , anyway , and i know i can always make new friends .","285412":"for the most part , yes . i have a few friendships that i ve been questionable about lately because they do not bring out the best in me , and we re sorta bad influences on each other especially in terms of drinking and making bad decisions , haha . they re a great friend and i m also very attached to them , which makes the situation harder for me to process .","285413":"music , most definitely . music has always been one of my greatest passions , and i try to listen to it as much as possible , whether it s an instrumental song classical music , hip hop , indie , alternative rock , etc etc .","285414":"yeah , that has happened to me on multiple occasions , lol . sometimes i sleep with my arm under my pillow as my head rests on the pillow , and i ll wake up in the middle of the night with my arm completely numb . i also get stiff necks sometimes when i sleep the wrong way , but that usually only happens when i get little sleep .","285415":"i actually went on a ferry last week to go from the cruise ship s dock to one of the islands in the bahamas . it was an interesting experience , and i didn t feel as sea sick as i thought i would . i was on the top deck so i got to see the entire ocean and scenery as it passed us by .","285416":"tbh , i m a white person and i feel like this question would be better answered by someone who s a person of color . as a white person and a very pale white person , at that , i ve always used either the beige bandaids or translucent band aids and never thought twice about the color .","285417":"i liked the show friends when i was much younger , but after re watching it within the past year or so , i didn t really find it to be spectacular or funny really . it was majorly hyped up during its time , which makes sense because it kinda pushed the boundaries in that time period i think it debuted in the s ? . i m apathetic towards the reunion episode , i have no intentions of watching it because i simply don t care . i don t really think it will ruin the original series because i ve heard that it isn t going to be a real episode , just a sit down with the actors actresses as they reflect upon the series .","285418":"the person i admire the most has faced so much adversity in their life , but they ve still managed to come out stronger in the end and utilized their experiences as a stepping stone toward the success they re garnered today . they ve also been humbled by their past experiences and obstacles , and it has equipped them with better knowledge and understanding of how the world works .","285419":"in a general sense , no . i don t believe so . social media simply allows people the opportunity to exhibit their rude callous behaviors , particularly when it comes to anonymous question asking sites like askfm or curiouscat . people like to hide behind anonymous identities and show their true colors because they re too ashamed to show that side of them in public .","285420":"i m basically an open book for the most part , but i do keep some things to myself unless asked in a respectful manner . i like sharing my experiences with others especially with respect to mental health in order to help them understand their own emotions and behavior .","285421":"yes , for most of my life i ve done certain things knowing that they weren t the right decision to make . things such as stealing , hurting other people intentionally , etc etc .","285422":"haha , yeah i got a decent tan ! ! i was out in the caribbean sun for about hours for two days straight .","285423":"honestly , a lot of the people seemed really snooty , and it was mostly families with children since a lot of schools had last week off for winter break . i didn t make any friends , which i m perfectly fine with . it wasn t my intention anyway .","285424":"no , we took a cruise ship from new jersey all the way down to the bahamas .","285425":"thank you ! ! it was so much fun so relaxing it was an day cruise to the bahamas , so i spent one day in florida and then two days in the bahamas . the ship was huge and beautiful with so many shops and bars lol , and there was also a casino so that was interesting too . here s a photo of the edge of one of the islands we went to as we rode in through the ferry .","285426":"my ability to empathize with other people through the written word .","285427":"i offer them my time and shoulder to cry on , for them to have a space to vent and receive feedback if they want it . i mainly try to be a source of comfort and consolation for them so that they don t feel alone in their thoughts . i want them to know that they aren t struggling in isolation .","285428":"last week , i visited the kennedy space center in florida , which was very interesting a lot of fun ! ! i saw shuttles and other space equipment used in the early apollo missions , and then the tour guide drove us to a different part of the center where we could see the former launch sites .","285429":"my roommate bought lunch for us earlier today , so i bought him two puff bars from the vape shop in return , lol .","285430":"i forgot to bring a physical copy of my resume to a job interview right after i had graduated from college , and the boss wouldn t even start the interview and sent me out after seconds of talking . i cried the entire drive home . i should note that the company already had my resume on file i had e mailed it to them the day prior so i was pretty upset , both at the company as well as at myself .","285431":"i don t carry one with me , but i have one at home and one at work . my home bottle is just a giant purple insulated thermos , while my work bottle is a gray cold thermos with the hogwarts crest on it .","285432":"yes , it was with his family .","285433":"yes , it was terrific ! ! i didn t really have any expectations , though . i ve never been on a cruise or left the country before , so it was all new to me .","285434":"returned home from vacation , went to the diner and vape shop , unpacked all of my clothing and belongings , and watched some television .","285435":"yes , i ve had people steal my identity before . it was an absolute nightmare and i m sorry you have to go through it as well .","285436":"depends on the situation and context . some hate is better off ignored , while other forms of hate should be addressed . personally speaking , when it comes to online hate like on askfm , i just ignore it most of the time . it isn t worth getting riled up over a stranger s opinion on your life , and it also isn t worth giving that person the privilege of seeing you get upset over their comments .","285437":"sunsets . ?","285438":"cheetos , lmaoo .","285439":"i used to be a night person , but now i m definitely more of a day person thanks to my job . i don t stay up late like i used to anymore , and i feel much more productive and happy when i wake up early and get things done during the day .","285440":"no , there s no use in being afraid to voice your own opinion . by making your opinions known , you ll garner a more authentic group of friends relationships , because then you re not basing your inner circle on something you don t necessarily believe in . i ve always been pretty open with my opinions .","285441":"i tried escargot for the first time last week ! ! they were in some sort of olive oil and pesto sauce as an appetizer .","285442":"i prefer to be behind the camera , most definitely . i m only occasionally comfortable with selfies if i m feeling okay that day , and i would rather take photos of scenery and nature than see photos of myself .","285443":"i didn t do anything for valentine s day because i was at work and then packing for my vacation .","285444":"i don t like turn based games , even though i ve tried some in the past .","285445":"i like walking around various parks and nature preserves , but i seldom go these days especially now considering it s winter . there are quite a few beautiful parks on long island .","285446":"i have a youtube account , but i don t post videos or comments . i only use it to watch videos and have other videos recommended to me based on what i ve already watched .","285447":"i have an account on medium , but i wouldn t consider it to be a blog because it s mostly a compilation of personal essays i ve written over the years .","285448":"i have the most followers on askfm , actually . lmaoo . i ve had this account for two years , i think , and a lot of my followers migrated from my older accounts since i ve been using askfm since around or so . i m not sure why so many people follow me but i can only assume it s because they find my answers interesting or entertaining .","285449":"i ll speak on behalf of last week , considering today is sunday . but the happiest moment of last week was sitting on the beach in the bahamas with a cold drink in my hand and the sun shining down on me with the smell of ocean all around .","285450":"none of my pullovers have holes in them , but i do have a few really old like years old hoodies that i can t bear to throw away .","285451":"not very often because a lot of my concerns are recognized as irrational , but quite a few really horrible fears of mine have come true .","285452":"mondays are usually the busiest day of the week for me , because i normally have to catch up on emails from over the weekend when i m at work , as well as set up weekly routines and whatnot . i find that i m most productive at work on mondays i guess because i feel recharged from being off during the weekend , lol .","285453":"i seldom block people on social media with the exception of a few family members whom i feel uncomfortable knowing my business .","285454":"i don t buy new clothing often at all , but occasionally i ll splurge if i really see something i like . i normally wear the same clothes for years , lol .","285455":"i m not sure what i m having for dinner tonight , let alone tomorrow night , lol .","285456":"it s a difficult situation to be in not every situation like that is going to be the same . in some cases , it may help if you do tell your ex that you still have feelings for them , but only if you think there s a chance things could be different going forward . if your ex is clearly happy with their life and or in a new relationship , then it s better for both of you if you simply tried to move on . you deserve to be happy as well , and hindering yourself by remaining in love with an ex who doesn t reciprocate those feelings only hurts you .","285457":"hairbrush , toothbrush and toothpaste , deodorant , body spray , vape pen , car , internet , etc etc .","285458":"i went to the vape store and purchased a new vape pen because my original vape pen died on me during my vacation .","285459":"i have dimples if i m genuinely happy smiling big enough .","285460":"i d love to adopt a dog and a few reptiles , like a bearded dragon or a chameleon .","285461":"my roommate and i went to the diner earlier this morning , and i ordered a spinach omelette .","285462":"people can absolutely befriend and remain friends with those of other sexes and genders , and it isn t inevitable that feelings would develop between them . platonic relationships are extremely common between people of different sexes and genders , and i personally have several friends who aren t of the same sex or gender as me .","285463":"it would depend on the context of their relationship and current friendship . if my partner s ex still had feelings for them , then i m not sure that i would be comfortable with the idea of them being friends still because it isn t giving the ex a chance to move on or it might give them hope that my partner would break up with me in favor of them . in most other circumstances , though , i see nothing wrong with exes being friends with each other .","285464":"it doesn t work for me most of the time when i ve tried using it , but it depends on my mood that day . some days i m more comfortable than others , so i ll be more apt to consider video responses on good days .","285465":"i have the samsung galaxy s right now , and it has the best camera of all of the previous phones i ve had . the quality is very high resolution and i like how the camera recognizes the setting and adjusts for the photo accordingly like for sunsets , for example .","285466":"i write magazine articles , press releases , and online content for my job . i also write creatively as well , usually in the form of personal essays and poetry .","285467":"yeah , i like some sour things . i don t usually eat candy , but warheads used to be my favorite .","285468":"this was last night s sunset on the cruise ship .","285469":"i don t play any sports .","285470":"i don t usually go to caf s , but there is a local coffee shop that i ve visited with friends a few times .","285471":"i eat steak occasionally , and i order it medium rare .","285472":"yes , i wear glasses every day .","285473":"it can be either or . sometimes , i crave solitude and will shut myself off from everyone . other times , i ll be craving social interaction and text my friends incessantly , talk to my roommates , make plans to go out , etc etc .","285474":"no , lol . her sister has a husband . sorry , family relationships are often confusing .","285475":"yes , i find painting to be very relaxing . i haven t painted anything in a long time , though .","285476":"i have to be in the mood for them , which most of the time i m not . when i get home from work , my brain is essentially shot and i don t have the energy to do deep thinking exercises .","285477":"i don t drink monster anymore i used to drink the energy tea i think it might have been raspberry or something ? , but it didn t give me any energy at all .","285478":"i m obsessed with spinach . lmaoo .","285479":"yes , i love broccoli . it s one of my favorite vegetables .","285480":"productive .","285481":"absolutely disgusting . it s a transphobic slur and shouldn t be used . trans women are still women .","285482":"i had general tso s chicken and thai spring rolls from the chinese food place .","285483":"i like plain strawberries on occasion . however , when i do crave something sweet , dark chocolate covered strawberries are delicious .","285484":"haha , no the coronavirus is extremely rare and basically only happening in wuhan , china right now . i got diagnosed with strep throat on sunday , so i ve been recovering from that . then i developed a head cold , smh . i ve been watching netflix and drinking water since i ve had an insatiable thirst since i got sick . this is the most water i ve drank perhaps in my entire life , lmaoo .","285485":"i ve wanted to try it out , but haven t really felt the overwhelming urge to . if anything , i ve been trying to avoid processed foods and eat more home cooked meals . with the exception of tonight . lmaoo .","285486":"thank you ! ! i m glad too , i was feeling horrible between saturday night and yesterday . i still woke up with the sweats this morning , but i haven t ran a fever all day and i m not as in pain or as congested as i previously was .","285487":"yes , this happens to me all the time . when i m verbally speaking , i constantly blank out and lose track of the words i m saying and some words don t even come to mind .","285488":"the only things i ve watched out of that list is the movie the notebook and the show you . i don t even know who noah centineo is , lol .","285489":"after getting over being sick , tonight i washed all of my sheets , comforters , blankets , etc etc . , to get the sickness out . i m excited to actually fall asleep without a fever and sleep in clean , sanitized sheets .","285490":"airplane window photo flying from texas to new york at sunrise .","285491":"my day has been fine , although rather hectic . i ve been scrambling to get last minute things done at work prior to my vacation this weekend so that there s less stress on everyone else .","285492":"general tso s spicy chicken . which is appropriate , considering i just ordered chinese food for delivery not too long ago . lmaoo .","285493":"i ve never owned an iphone , so i honestly have zero clue . you re better off asking someone who uses apple products .","285494":"i honestly don t remember when it was or what it was about . we seldom argue .","285495":"no , i m not quite sure how you can successfully wear a shirt upside down .","285496":"my day has been fine . i m still sick , but after tonight i won t be contagious anymore so i can go back to work tomorrow morning .","285497":"ugh , myself . i pick at my skin compulsively , and i really wanted to try to clear up my skin before my trip since i ll be wearing short sleeves bathing suits and stuff . but i ve been so bad the past two days , it s going to look horrible .","285498":"i d rather not have internet access , haha . i work on a computer at a desk , and i can t imagine standing working the entire time . also . . . standing driving would be hella weird .","285499":"yes ! ! i m leaving to go on a cruise to the bahamas this saturday .","285500":"i love art , especially surrealism whether it s painting or digital or photography . i m also an avid fan of writing literature , as well as music . i haven t drawn anything in a while , but here is a skull i drew last month after not drawing for like . . . a year .","285501":"absolutely ! ! i would love to meet shehitsback , celinem , littlesha , misphire and heartofstitches .","285502":"i don t use wax melts or incense , but i have a lot of candles . my favorite one right now is a bergamot scented candle .","285503":"? ? ? i don t know what you re talking about .","285504":"well obviously not the killers themselves , but i find the psychology behind it all to be intriguing .","285505":"i engage in writing , photography sometimes , and drawing painting . i consider them to be an outlet for my emotions , when it comes to writing at least , but also an urge to create something , which is evident in my recent drawings . i ve already developed my interest in writing into an occupation , for which i m quite thankful . i m currently a writer editor for a publishing company , and i do freelance writing on the side .","285506":"no , i rarely get offended . not much bothers me these days because everything seems rather insignificant .","285507":"i m very open emotionally , to trusted people at the very least . i m open with my boyfriend and close friends , and i openly express my worries and insecurities and concerns because i need the validation that i m doing the right thing .","285508":"they very seldom have family gatherings because the family is literally spread out across the entire country , lol . most of them are actually in florida , but they seldom travel to new york . these days , the family gatherings consist of just my boyfriend , his father , his father s girlfriend and her two daughters , and his father s girlfriend s family a sister , her husband , and two daughters . it isn t really that many people , but it s still a significant amount .","285509":"i usually just ignore it , but it does get on my nerves sometimes .","285510":"idk , i guess wendy s ? their spicy nuggets and crispy chicken sandwiches are pretty tasty .","285511":"i don t agree with the death penalty , so i disagree with this notion . however , i do believe that drunk drivers whose actions result in fatalities should get life in prison .","285512":"i dislike shopping a lot , especially in crowded places like the grocery store or the mall . i can only be out for perhaps an hour maximum before i get overwhelmed . it takes a lot out of me .","285513":". i m obsessed with true crime documentaries shows about serial killers . . i have a degree in professional writing with a minor in english literature . . my current occupation is a writer editor for a publishing company . . i don t like regular water i only drink flavored seltzer water . . my favorite video games are skyrim , the fallout series , the bioshock series , and the assassin s creed series . . i quit smoking cigarettes last september after smoking a pack a day for years . . i prefer beer over wine , and wine over liquor . . i m diagnosed with several mental illnesses and prescribed multiple psychiatric medications . . i ve been in a relationship since . . i currently live with two roommates and two cats .","285514":"confide in my boyfriend and or close friends about what had happened to me .","285515":"idk , probably something similar to what i m doing now with more of a focus on creative writing . perhaps a freelance novelist or poet .","285516":"i ve just never been interested in sports .","285517":"household chores , particularly cleaning or doing laundry . also , driving . i have nearly an hour commute to and from work each day .","285518":"yesterday , i was playing skyrim for most of the afternoon .","285519":"definitely not , considering i was a smoker for around years . smoking is extremely harmful to the body and there are literally zero benefits to smoking .","285520":"yes , i am currently in love .","285521":"thanks for the follow","285522":"i don t believe it was rude at all you obviously don t know him , lol . it most definitely needed to be addressed because it was a lot of weight in such a short span of time , and he was concerned for my health . i don t even remember how he said it , it happened two or more years ago .","285523":"no , i knew it wasn t in a negative way and he was just bringing it up because it needed to be addressed . the weight gain was so quick that he was concerned for my health and wasn t quite sure what had happened . obviously he doesn t care if i m fat or skinny , i m still me , but i wasn t hurt by it because i had also noticed it too .","285524":"hello do you have a question ?","285525":"i don t like watching or playing any sports .","285526":"i don t follow people on request .","285527":"i don t follow people on request , sorry .","285528":"he expressed concern when i first initially started gaining weight as a result of my inactivity medication , but it wasn t in a negative tone . he was more worried than anything else .","285529":"coffee , true crime documentaries , serial killers , mental health awareness , art , writing , and animals .","285530":"i think read in a distinct voice , but i ve never been certain of whose voice is it i don t recognize it as my own , but i also don t recognize it as anyone else s either . i also read and think with the words appearing as images in the forefront of my mind , like i can visualize what i m thinking and often i fixate on certain words .","285531":"depends , it s constantly changing . right now , i m pretty neutral not happy , but not sad either .","285532":"yes , i agree ! !","285533":"i believe that a combination of healthy eating routine exercise is much better and healthier for losing weight than following a fad diet , like the keto diet for example . the keto diet certainly works to a certain degree , but it s a lifestyle change and people who stop doing keto end up gaining their weight back most of the time . it isn t long term .","285534":"i would suggest that they focus more on obtaining more sleep instead of exercising . they re going to wear themselves out completely and get sick .","285535":"it s around degrees fahrenheit and it s raining .","285536":"ninegdxfour and i don t talk often , but i wouldn t be opposed to meeting her ! !","285537":"you can easily google this information like i just did , lol .","285538":"you re going to have to be more specific . what exactly would you like me to describe ?","285539":"my boyfriend used to be really messy , but that s gotten a lot better as he s gotten older . other than that , he doesn t really have any annoying habits other than things like sucking on his teeth when he s stressed , lmaoo . if you re worried about things amplifying when you move in together , is there a way for you to talk to him about it all ?","285540":"definitely , there are quite a few people whom i d love to meet . i m closest to littlesha , shehitsback , celinem , and misphire .","285541":"yes , i ve heard of the term before know what it is .","285542":"no , i m not interested in that at all .","285543":"i love tattoos i think they re a terrific means of self expression and form of art .","285544":"in bed , unsuccessfully trying to take a nap .","285545":"? ? ? i m definitely not famous all i did was answer a question . lmaoo calm down .","285546":"sarcastic with a hint of dark morbid .","285547":"mine has been fairly active . i also have a lot of leftover questions in my inbox , so i ve been answering those occasionally .","285548":"i honestly would have no clue unless the situation presented itself . i don t have children and i can t fathom the idea of even having kids .","285549":"depends on whether or not it s actually plausible . most vacations are paid for x amount of days ahead of time , so there s no possible way to change that . i would explain that to the child and tell them we ll go on another vacation soon .","285550":"i think three days can be sufficient depending on the individual . then again , i work nearly every day of the week so any time off is beautiful to me , lmaoo .","285551":"i have around questions in my inbox . which ones were yours ?","285552":"lol . you literally brought this upon yourself by questioning logic when all i said was that i wanted to see a movie . have a nice day , anon","285553":"uh . . . you were the one who brought up the subject of logic ? it s just a movie , dude .","285554":"i m not being defensive and my intent isn t to appear defensive either . it s just silly to look into this so deeply when it means nothing .","285555":"okay ? just because i don t care about the oscars doesn t mean that i can t be interested in seeing a movie that s supposed to be really good , lol .","285556":"cold hands , since my hands are always cold anyway .","285557":"no , i haven t visited a library since high school .","285558":"i don t . i didn t watch them , but i saw on twitter that parasite won a lot of awards so that made me interested in seeing the movie .","285559":"i m paying for myself , lol .","285560":"abortion is a health care concern and anyone should be able to obtain an abortion regardless of the reason behind it .","285561":"we ve been together for around years . i m not really focused on marriage , it isn t a priority for us .","285562":"my boyfriend and his family .","285563":"we started planning it last spring . it was originally my boyfriend s father s idea and his girlfriend and we all agreed that it would be a once in a lifetime trip .","285564":"i saw that it won a lot of awards last night , so now i m curious ! !","285565":"depends on the day whether or not i m going out to see people .","285566":"well , my week is definitely far from energetic , but i appreciate the message .","285567":"it means that you re out about being gay instead of closeted .","285568":"going to the pharmacy to pick up antibiotics so that i can start to feel better .","285569":"joker parasite .","285570":"who said i was rich ? lol . god forbid i take a vacation for the first time in over five years . granted , i had to do some magic tricks with my money and work overtime , but nevertheless i deserve to go on vacation .","285571":"i enjoyed them a lot , and i found the stories to be very compelling . obviously there s some dramatization to the stories , but i m more focused on the actual story than whether or not it s entirely true .","285572":"i used to watch those a lot , but haven t in a while ! ! they weren t so much documentaries , but i used to watch shows like paranormal lockdown , ghost brothers , ghost hunters , ghost adventures , etc etc .","285573":"i don t usually eat cheeseburgers , but when i do , i just order a regular burger with cheese , lettuce , and tomato .","285574":"i already know who my real friends are . i don t need to cease contact with anyone to verify that .","285575":"no , i wouldn t do that at this point in my life . that would mean no contact with my boyfriend or close friends , and that would be upsetting .","285576":"i m pretty sure that s standard protocol ? depending on how much they ve stolen , i . e . a significant sum of money from the lockbox or cash register .","285577":"yes , i think minimum wage in general should be hour and all other jobs will be increased as well . the cost of living is too high for the current minimum wage , it isn t considered a liveable wage anymore .","285578":"thank you","285579":"possibly . i m still debating on it , because i know i won t be checking my account during my vacation . getting all of the notifications will be aggravating , unless i simply turn off notifications on my phone .","285580":"i ve never seen any of the lego movies or even played any of the lego games based on movies , haha .","285581":"if you re friends with a coworker , then i believe that you need to compartmentalize your feelings of friendship with the relationship you have with them as an employee . you shouldn t discriminate against other employees to whom you do not have a personal relationship , and you need to separate your personal feelings from your professional feelings .","285582":"neither . i m a realist above all else . i weigh the pros and cons of various situations and understand that every situation has different sides to it .","285583":"i don t know much about either character . i ve never really been interested in marvel or dc .","285584":"i m not sure i understand the question . my dynamics with my friends are different from my dynamics with coworkers , and if an employee was doing something wrong , i would have simply pulled them aside , explained what they were doing wrong , and teach them to do it right instead . if they were still being lazy or insubordinate or whatever , then i would refer the situation to a higher authority .","285585":"i don t smoke cigarettes anymore . i vape occasionally , though .","285586":"my boyfriend s family got some sort of group deal perhaps groupon ? on the trip , so it wasn t very expensive , considering it s an day cruise . i m going with my boyfriend and his family .","285587":"both , but i suspect that a lot if not most humans are fueled by greed .","285588":"i m going to the bahamas .","285589":"it s somewhere different than i ve ever been before , and i think it would be interesting to experience a culture that i ve not been acquainted with . one of my closest friends from my teenage years is chinese , and she went to hong kong a few years ago to visit family . she said it was a really fun trip .","285590":"i m not going to hong kong , lmaoo . the question asked where i would go if i had to choose a hour flight somewhere .","285591":"i wouldn t risk it even at that , there s an abundance of sickness going around the office and my immune system is already low right now , so i could easily catch something else . unfortunately , my time off is unpaid right now because i used up my pto for the month to take a day off from work after my vacation . i used up all of my vacation time for my vacation next week .","285592":"that i m a strong , capable , and compassionate person despite all that i ve gone through during my life . i don t give myself enough credit where credit is due , and i m constantly criticizing myself or trying to overcompensate when it isn t needed at all .","285593":"much better than yesterday , thank goodness . i took two doses of antibiotics so far , and the doctor at the clinic last night also gave me some steroids for the inflammation , so i was able to sleep well . i haven t had a fever since last night either , and i feel functional today . if i wasn t really contagious , i would have gone to work , lol .","285594":"physically , the hardest and most painful thing i ve ever had to do well , not had to , but wanted to , lol was get my ribcage tattooed . by far the worst pain i ve ever been in .","285595":"nature , mainly . i love forests , beaches , sunsets , waterfalls , and mountains .","285596":"you can t really generalize people in such a broad sphere like this because everyone has different motives in their lives . some people value money , while others value love , while there are even some people who value both equally .","285597":"depends on the child some children are more responsible than others , and while some kids may need their homework checked , there are also others whose homework doesn t necessarily need to be checked because the parents already know that they ve finished it .","285598":"personally , i don t think having a friends only option would benefit me because most of the questions i receive are anonymous , and i prefer the public platform . i often have anonymous people come to me for advice and whatnot , and they prefer their identity to be unknown for privacy s sake .","285599":"my boyfriend and i would probably fly to hong kong , since that s one of the few flights that are hours long coming out of new york .","285600":"the fourth edition of my job s magazine was completed for online production last week , which is the collaborative efforts of myself alongside a graphic designer and a print production manager . nearly everything in the magazine was written , proofread , and cross examined by me , and i accompanied the magazine with an editor s letter , which introduced readers to what they re about to read . my supervisor read my letter and said it was superb , which made me feel really good about myself .","285601":"when it comes to creative writing , i seem to derive inspiration from the events that are currently going on in my life , whether it s heartache or a sense of accomplishment or negative thoughts stemming from poor mental health . i ve always seemed to write more eloquently when i m not in a healthy frame of mind , for whatever reason , but it s very cathartic to let those emotions out in a constructive manner .","285602":"i ve always wanted to travel cross country and visit the redwoods national park and the grand canyon , both in the united states . i would also like to see the badlands and yosemite national park .","285603":"dragons , most definitely . i ve been obsessed with dragons since i was young .","285604":"i respect my boyfriend and a few close friends the most , as well as one or two coworkers and my supervisor . it takes a lot to earn my respect , but once someone does earn it , i m forever loyal to them .","285605":"listening to relaxing music in the mornings . having the first cup of coffee of the day . hearing my boyfriend and close friends laugh hysterically . writing something creative and being proud of it . grabbing food and drinks with people i love . taking walks in nature preserves and on the beach . playing video games , especially skyrim or the fallout series . watching true crime documentaries essentially learning new things about forensics and criminal psychology .","285606":"beginning to self harm . i wouldn t have started in the first place . dating my ex boyfriend . it was a really toxic and unhealthy relationship . beginning to smoke cigarettes . it turned into a year addiction that likely worsened my health greatly and compromised my immune system .","285607":"neither , to a certain degree . when you truly love someone in a healthy manner , you push them and motivate them to remain consistent with their natural selves but to also improve upon their natural selves . you re not changing them , but you re seeking to watch them gain the confidence to be the best version of themselves they can possibly be .","285608":"i haven t heard anything about it in quite some time , so i assume it hasn t gone very far at all . it s common knowledge that the earth is spherical , so flat earth conspiracy theorists are pretty ignorant .","285609":"i never have , but it s something i ve always wanted to do ! !","285610":"i usually avoid people i dislike as much as possible , and if i do have to interact with them , i do so on such a professional cold basis that all it takes is to get the job done , and then we part ways . i have no time in my life for silly politics or drama , and if i don t like someone , i won t explicitly make it known to them because that doesn t help anyone .","285611":"i think alien invasions are more likely , since i don t really believe that humans can turn into zombies unless someone has a source stating otherwise ! . i ve always believed in aliens however , at the same time , i feel like they already know about our existence , and if they wanted to invade us , they would have already .","285612":"a video that my roommate showed me yesterday on tiktok , lol .","285613":"normally , i hate mondays . however , today isn t such a terrible day because i m home from work although i am sick and this gives me a chance to catch up on some last minute preparations i need to do for my trip this weekend .","285614":"i would much rather have all white hair as opposed to no hair at all . i ve always contemplated on shaving my head , for example , but i feel like i wouldn t be able to pull off the look .","285615":"i don t know how to make much , but scrambled eggs are the easiest and one of my favorite meals , lol . i prefer breakfast food over basically any other food , so it works to my advantage .","285616":"i just started listening to this ambience hour video of tundra by jeremy soule with a winter background . https www . youtube . com watch ? v abkl cxvq","285617":"my boyfriend coffee .","285618":"halloween is my favorite holiday .","285619":"hearing a loved one s laughter , going out on a coffee date with a close friend , traveling , relaxing to your favorite music at the end of a long day , putting on sweatpants and an oversized shirt after getting home from work , reading a compelling book , going on vacation with loved ones whether it s friends or family or your partner , etc etc .","285620":"i don t really have many apps except for social media , so my favorites are probably instagram askfm . i don t have any apps that i dislike , if i did then i would simply uninstall them .","285621":"mondays are normally the busiest for me , because it s when i usually have to check up on all of the missed work from the weekend and start the weekly routine plan for what i ll be doing for the remainder of the week .","285622":"i love that i m creative .","285623":"the best time of today was waking up and having a cup of iced coffee this morning . the worst time was the moment before i decided i needed to go to urgent care , because i literally couldn t move or breathe and i was sweating profusely from a fever . right now is pretty good too actually i took my first dose of antibiotics and steroids , and i feel almost normal .","285624":"i prefer brand names when it comes to medicine , but virtually everything else is generic store brand .","285625":"depends on my mood . lately , i ve been using one from bath body works that i got for christmas called winter snow .","285626":"sounds disgusting .","285627":"i exclusively wear sweatpants when i m home .","285628":"i definitely will , they said i can t go back to work until wednesday , haha .","285629":"thank you ! ! i just got home from urgent care i have strep .","285630":"i don t care i won t be watching .","285631":"idk cleaned , cooked a healthy breakfast , did laundry , ran errands , etc etc .","285632":"drinking lots of tea and watching criminal minds .","285633":"i m coming down with an illness and i slept for most of the afternoon . i was supposed to go to my parents house to celebrate my aunt s birthday , but i could only bear to be there for like minutes before i had to go home . i feel terrible and i don t know if i m going to work tomorrow . i ll see how i feel in the morning , but if not , i m going to urgent care .","285634":"probably ? i honestly have no idea , lmaoo .","285635":"that makes sense . it isn t a priority at the moment , though . i ve been doing okay without my therapist so i d like to see what transpires first .","285636":"i don t think i ever believed in god in the first place . according to my parents , apparently i told them after my confirmation which happened when i was younger than years old .","285637":"she was my best friend and we shared common interests .","285638":"just one . i ve only been in three relationships , lol .","285639":"at times , yes . mostly , they were very possessive and controlling .","285640":"depends on the person . i ve never had a specific type .","285641":"i don t have any memories of it .","285642":"i can t . all i know is that it happened , lol .","285643":"it was well overdue . i ve been wanting to move out since my early s , and i finally had the capabilities to do so after obtaining a promotion and a raise at work this past summer .","285644":"i m bisexual , so i m attracted to various genders .","285645":"i don t know what my parents believe .","285646":"no , whenever we do see each other , we get along pretty well .","285647":"somewhat , sure . he s still in new york state .","285648":"no , i ve never experienced that . i m also in a relationship , so the only person i ve had feelings for is my boyfriend .","285649":"no , he isn t married either .","285650":"no , he doesn t .","285651":"i never accused them , it s something i ve known was happening to me since the age of .","285652":"yeah , you re considered a minor .","285653":"child ab se is a crime , so obviously yes .","285654":"i m not close enough to him to really know his personality .","285655":"they didn t practice catholicism , i . e . going to church and whatnot , but i know they believe in god and we used to go to church . i got confirmed and everything .","285656":"i moved out last october . i was years old .","285657":"no . i have no desire to even bring up the subject with my family , and i don t value a relationship with my family at all . it isn t something that s important to me , and i ve been working on improving myself ever since .","285658":"i only remember my teenage years , so i know i struggled with ab se when i was a teenager . i can only assume that also applied to my childhood as well , considering those memories are repressed .","285659":"so so . we only talk when necessary , and we only see each other at family gatherings .","285660":"i honestly have zero idea . he s significantly older than me .","285661":"not to my knowledge , no . i never brought it up to anyone .","285662":"i m not quite sure what you mean by this , i don t know what transference means .","285663":"we re in this together ! ! i m sorry you ve had to experience this stuff too , though .","285664":"this is inappropriate and a bit invasive , so i won t be answering this question .","285665":"he s been living his own life for quite some time , and he isn t close to my mother or father .","285666":"s icidal thoughts , self harm , impulsive decisions , racing thoughts , etc etc .","285667":"i have one brother .","285668":"i ve distanced myself from them due to a general lack of trust in them stemming from my teenage years after sustaining years of ab se .","285669":"yes , they re still married .","285670":"she s pretty , but obviously i wasn t attracted to her , lol .","285671":"she s involved in case management for children with intellectual disabilities .","285672":"no , a therapist is a licensed counselor or even a psychologists with multiple degrees who has been trained in particular techniques to help clients navigate their feelings and develop productive means of coping with their negative or harmful thoughts and behavior .","285673":"i m not close to my parents , so i don t remember what religion i was raised in . this occurred prior to my teenage years .","285674":"based on its presence on social media , and especially the older presence feminism had on askfm , it has been given a bad reputation . legitimate feminists are not taken as seriously because younger , more ignorant people who consider themselves feminists have sorta taken over the movement , and there are so many subsections of feminism that a lot of people simply don t understand .","285675":"they re catholic , from my understanding .","285676":"cont . . . cont . . . i have tried to say this several times in a gentler way , but it doesn t seem to make any difference . it s making me want to delete both social media platforms . what would you do ? any advice would be much appreciated , thanks ! that s a really difficult situation , and it seems like your friend is overly dependent on you for one reason or another . if you ve tried to say something in the past in a gentle way and they didn t get the hint , then i think it s appropriate to approach the subject again in a more straightforward way so that they know how stressed their behavior is making you . friendships shouldn t make you stressed out or unhappy , and your friend definitely needs to know that they re being over bearing and perhaps even a little obsessive . you have your own life , and they have theirs , and they need to understand that you re being pushed away from them because of their obsessive need to talk to you . if they truly respected you , they would respect your boundaries .","285677":"no . even when i took classes in religion when i was a child , i ve never believed or been religious .","285678":"i still hold the same opinions , but i stopped associating with the feminist movement in general at least the new feminist movement of the s because most feminists focused on insignificant issues , spread misinformation , cherry picked arguments to support their own causes , and were just in general giving the whole feminist ideology a bad name .","285679":"it would mean starting over from scratch , and i have such history with my old therapist we saw each other for three years that it seems like so much effort to start from the very beginning and guide the new therapist through the ins and outs of my life starting from my early teenage years until now .","285680":"we clicked instantly and had a great connection , and even when i couldn t find the words to describe what i was feeling , she automatically understood and filled in the blanks , so to speak .","285681":"she quit her job . she was slowly transitioning from her job into a new job by keeping her long term clients on a part time basis , but eventually she quit her job as a therapist to pursue new ventures .","285682":"i used to consider myself an intersectional feminist , but i haven t associated with the feminist movement in quite a number of years .","285683":"some people turn to religion because it was simply an environment in which they were raised , and they were taught by their families and community to believe in that religion because it answers questions , i . e . do we have a higher purpose , why are we here , etc etc .","285684":"it isn t a political ideology , no . people who are feminists usually have opinions about politics , however . it depends on the particular person .","285685":"you re asking me something that occurred more than years ago . i honestly don t remember .","285686":"cont . . . i decided to let them know anyway just so he wouldn t have to live with the tortured secret for so long and could move on . i sent them screenshots of the texts for proof and whatnot . he found out and was extremely angry with me , cussed me out , said very hurtful things , and cut me off . why do you think he was being so sensitive and overreacting to it ? it really bothered me when all i was trying to do was help . i feel like he was being really ungrateful and i m better off without him . your thoughts ? if this is real and i really hope it isn t , then you re honestly a terrible friend . i can t tell if this is actually someone trolling or not because it s simply common sense to not out your friends to their friends and family it s extremely dangerous . not only did you disrespect your friend , but you but them in harm s way by outing them to their friends and family . if their family was extremely homophobic , it could be possible that they could have kicked him out , disowned them , and severed ties with them . it isn t your decision to make , and you should be ashamed of yourself for taking this into your own hands . he was not being sensitive or over reacting at all . i m glad that he cut you off because you need to learn how not to cross boundaries , and he s better off without you in his life .","285687":"feminism isn t a religion . feminism at least intersectional feminism is the advocacy of equity among all people , regardless of their gender , sexual orientation , sex , religion , or race .","285688":"i honestly don t know what my parents believe when it comes to the separation of church and state , haha . i remember being taught about it in school , however , and it resonated with me .","285689":"because religion has no significance in politics , and a political system should not be guided by a particular religion , especially when there is no official religion in the united states to begin with .","285690":"i m doing fine , although i do miss my old therapist a lot . i still don t know if i want to find a new therapist or not .","285691":"no , i firmly believe in the separation of church and state .","285692":"i certainly have the ability to , but that doesn t mean i want to .","285693":"no , i ve never done that before .","285694":"i think i m getting sick , so i ve been exhausted and sleeping for most of the day . i had a pain in my chest when i woke up around am , then i was tired again so i napped from to pm and woke up in a puddle of sweat . i took a shower to regulate my body temperature , and then i started getting a lot of sinus pressure in my head . i feel a bit better now after taking advil and robitussin , but i really hope this passes quickly .","285695":"a few days ago when i saw my boyfriend .","285696":"i try to take time out of each day to do something for myself , whether it s relaxing with a cup of coffee or tea while doing something i enjoy or playing video games or trying to purge myself of my feelings through writing .","285697":"i received various awards in high school for art and academics , but that s it .","285698":"i ve never tried it , no . i don t generally eat fast food . it s something i would definitely try , since from my understanding it s a plant based burger .","285699":"we say hi to each other if we re both outside at the same time , but that s the extent of it .","285700":"picadillo and empanadas .","285701":"i m more of a morning person now than i ve ever been in the past , mainly due to working a job for the past four years , lol . when i wake up late , like i did today , i feel horrible and like i got nothing productive done . i wasted half of my day sleeping when i could have been doing something else .","285702":"ginger tea and soup in bed , while watching television .","285703":"listening to music , drinking coffee , and answering questions on askfm .","285704":"cont . . . like they would say i wasn t this super lazy before but now i got super lazy with you . isn t that wrong though ? it s like you wanna say then don t be with me lol breaking up with them is entirely your decision i don t know the dynamics of the relationship , and it isn t something for me to decide like , yeah , you should end the relationship . it isn t in my place to make that judgment . do what you think is best , but i always believe communication is key . ask them why they feel that way , think of ways to make it better , etc etc . try to fix the relationship before ending it completely , not unless there s absolutely no hope left .","285705":"i ve been to a few comedy shows , and i enjoyed them a lot ! ! one of my close friends is really into comedy , so i ve gone to them all with her , and we had such a good time . we saw dan soder twice . we were watching a few comedy specials on hbo last night , and we came across a comedian named daniel sloss . he was absolutely hilarious and i would love to see him .","285706":"protective is being concerned for your partner and wanting to shield them from harm s way , but also recognizing that they need to make their own decisions . you should also trust them that they ll make the correct decisions too , out of respect . a possessive relationship is borderline ab sive and causes you to become too obsessed with your partner and prevent them from living their life according to their own terms .","285707":"they ll probably get angry , but it s the truth and they ll have to learn to accept that . obviously you should phrase it in a nicer way , but it is true that ultimately they re in control of themselves and if they believe that they re lazy , it s in their own power to change . they cannot deflect their own insecurities onto you and blame you for something that isn t your fault .","285708":"shehitsback urlsareshittbh kittiemeowsie celinem youcuntx psyquietrist misphire littlesha","285709":"well , if they re literally saying that you re causing them to be lazy , then that s definitely wrong in itself . we are responsible for ourselves and ourselves only , and ultimately they need to make that choice to change themselves . they cannot rely on you or hold you responsible for something that s entirely their decision .","285710":"get over it and move onto someone else .","285711":"it isn t really wrong , but it s pretty pointless , lol .","285712":"well , a considering i m currently in a relationship .","285713":"it doesn t necessarily mean that they re not interested in you anymore , but they re realized that the relationship hasn t progressed any further and they want to do something to change that . i would be upset , obviously , but i would try to work things out to make each of us feel more accomplished in the relationship while still moving forward and bettering ourselves and our lives .","285714":"no , it doesn t happen very often to me because i don t follow many people who post photo polls .","285715":"i prefer autumn sunsets . i like sunsets better than sunrises , anyway . ones in autumn are just more beautiful .","285716":"i live in new york . i m a writer editor for a publishing company .","285717":"i didn t watch the superbowl or the half time show , so i really have zero idea .","285718":"last night , i had a friend come over and we watched comedy specials on hbo while drinking .","285719":"i don t follow people on request .","285720":"my roommate was quoting a meme , and it made me laugh .","285721":"perhaps my loyalty to my friends . i ve always been a loyal person , and if someone tells me something in confidence , it doesn t escape my lips .","285722":", followers .","285723":"my moods fluctuate greatly throughout the course of a day , lol . i would say it s ranged between a and an , though .","285724":"mayonnaise freaks me out . it literally makes me gag just looking at it or hearing it or smelling it .","285725":"depends on what you re asking to begin with . i reply to most of my anonymous messages , though .","285726":"yes , i would love to keep receiving your questions ! !","285727":"at the moment , i m drinking iced tea , listening to music , and answering questions here on askfm .","285728":"i ve never had a desire to try it before .","285729":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope you have a great weekend as well . i m glad that friday is almost over , lol . work today was a bit stressful , but i survived that s all that matters .","285730":"yes , i ve been in my relationship both prior to and after i started taking medication . he s always been supportive of me , even though there were some aspects of my mental illnesses he didn t particularly understand . but during my darkest episodes , he always has tried his best to comfort me even though i was basically inconsolable .","285731":"i m doing well . i just got home from work , and i m looking forward to doing absolutely nothing for the next . days . sunday is going to be a super busy day , unfortunately , which will no doubt make monday come by faster . . . but it is what it is .","285732":"well , it s pm on friday , so my weekend has just begun . i have no plans for the evening except to relax and catch up on some television shows , so i suppose it s going well so far .","285733":"yeah ? that would be very controlling and manipulative if i didn t allow him to talk to other women .","285734":"my boyfriend .","285735":"i usually show up minutes early , but traffic was so horrible that i ended up being minutes late . but there was an accident on the freeway , so a lot of people were late today . so it wasn t a huge deal , but i still felt so bad .","285736":"of course doesn t everyone ? lol .","285737":"occasionally , yeah . just not them .","285738":"i ve never heard either album .","285739":"i prefer cooking them on the grill outside . it tastes so much better than way , compared to cooking them in a pan on the stove .","285740":"yes , that is completely normal . i do the same exact thing when i rely on my boyfriend or friends for support when i m going through an episode . i also hate placing my burdens on other people . but when you need the support , you need the support . and those who are good for you will provide you with that support regardless .","285741":"yes , lmaoo . it was when i was an angsty , depressed teenager . i wanted to paint my walls black , but because my room was already small , i knew it would make it look even smaller so i settled with red and gray .","285742":"thank you so much .","285743":"well , there s a difference between cheating on someone and then sending pictures to people as a form of monetary compensation . if your aim is to cheat on your boyfriend , then that s obviously wrong . but if people are paying for your pictures , then all the more power to them .","285744":"eh , not really . the only hard liquor i like is vodka and tequila . i ll sometimes mix vodka with flavored seltzer , and then i like margaritas .","285745":"i m technically off from my normal job on weekends , but occasionally i ll pick up some freelance work on the weekends that i ll do saturday and sunday mornings at home .","285746":"literally staring at the slogan right now . lol . it s all right it s pretty flavorless , but it s still tasty .","285747":"i love lagers and ipas . however , i m not really picky about the beer i like . i mostly drink ipas , but i do drink light stuff on occasion , miller light and corona light being among my favorites .","285748":"i was drinking new belgium voodoo ranger , but there was only one left . so now i m drinking miller high life .","285749":"i don t feel like answering the current questions in my inbox , so ask me interesting questions while i drink some beer ! !","285750":"the dmv ? haha . i absolutely loathe going to the dmv , and i m going to have to eventually go there to change my address that s on my current license .","285751":"yeah , there was a picture of a tree that i took which i submitted to a nature themed tumblr , and it garnered over likes reblogs whatever . i was so taken aback by it because i didn t think the picture was anything special , haha . it was this one , actually","285752":"probably , if i wanted children at least . i m still on the fence about the entire ordeal . adoption would be the best option for me .","285753":"the name leigh means delicate or a meadow .","285754":"this isn t recent , but . . . when i first got hired at my job two years ago , one of my coworkers had a conversation with the ceo of the company . the ceo walked into our department and asked if anyone had any pickles note he s addicted to pickles , and my coworker said yeah , i have a spare jar in my trunk . the ceo says , i ll give you for them . go and get them now . so , my coworker leaves the office and comes back minutes later with a costco sized jar of pickles . it was the weirdest f cking thing , especially considering i had only been working there for two weeks when it happened . lmaoo . who keeps a spare jar of pickles in their car ? in case of an emergency ?","285755":"climate change , most likely . we re already feeling the effects now , and it s only going to get worse with each generation .","285756":"you re going to make it out of this alive , and most importantly , you re going to thrive . you re going to escape . you re going to make a life for yourself and leave the past behind .","285757":"thank you","285758":"last week , i was struggling greatly with grief the grief of my boyfriend s dog passing away , a dog whom i ve loved for more than years . it was such a significant hit that i couldn t bear the thought of being there for when he was put down , and i still feel so guilty for not being there for him during such a critical moment . however , my boyfriend keeps telling me that it s perfectly fine . i saw his dog the night before he passed away and he took his last pain med from me when he refused it from everyone else . he went outside to use the bathroom with me leading him when he wouldn t go out for anyone else . my boyfriend said i did more for him then than if i were to have shown up at the vet clinic .","285759":"i haven t rescued an animal directly , but my former dog was a rescue dog from an animal adoption agency . she was rescued from an ab sive family and was taken in by the adoption center , and no one wanted her for some reason probably because she was a bit on the older side .","285760":"a person who is straightforward expresses their thoughts in a way that doesn t degrade the person to whom they re speaking . they re considerate of their feelings , but they also understand that their words are necessary for the other person s growth and understanding . someone who s an inconsiderate a hole , on the other hand , says things without any consideration for how the other person feels , and sometimes it s more of a means to make themselves feel better than to make the other person feel better .","285761":"being untreated for mental illness versus being treated for mental illness . prior to delving into treatment medication therapy , i was lower than miserable and was actively planning my own death . i laid in bed for weeks straight . i didn t eat . i didn t shower . i had no emotions whatsoever , and i missed so much work and was lucky that i never got fired . after a few weeks of treatment , even though it took quite a few trials of medication experimentation , i definitely began to feel the effects of both medication combined with weekly therapy appointments . i felt lighter like i had something more to live for , i had a purpose and that was to help other people who have been in similar situations and show them that living life is possible afterall .","285762":"someone you loved by lewis capaldi . https www . youtube . com watch ? v zablecsr ue","285763":"well , my most recent big purchase was the payment owed for my upcoming vacation . i m not sure what my next big purchase will be , though , besides whatever attractions i want to be part of while i m in the caribbean .","285764":"classical piano and or the violin . preferably together .","285765":"i have resting b tch face , so apparently pretty good . i rarely show emotion on my face unless i m , like . . . hysterically crying or super angry to the point where i m seeing red .","285766":"no , not all religious people that s a broad statement that certainly doesn t apply to everyone from any kind of religious group . i know plenty of people who follow religion who are open minded individuals .","285767":"i took the money from my savings account . i would rather use my money for life changing experiences than have it sit there and do nothing , especially considering i realistically don t know when i ll pass away . why pass up a once in a lifetime opportunity just because i want to save some cash that i ll eventually earn back anyway ?","285768":"i think it depends on the man , because it depends entirely on genetics as well as stress levels , from my understanding .","285769":"we re going to a few different places ! ! i think nassau is one of them . i don t remember , i d have to look at the itinerary .","285770":"yes , i agree . the senate is controlled by republicans , who will obviously support trump . i was happy when he was initially impeached , especially considering its historical context , but i knew it wasn t going to go anywhere , unfortunately .","285771":"we re not exchanging gifts , especially considering we just paid for the vacation a few weeks ago and are struggling with money right now . we re going to the bahamas .","285772":"why would i feel like a loser ? lmaoo , i haven t heard that term since high school . the senate acquitted him , which is what i expected to happen anyway .","285773":"any sort of ab se and r pe , terrorism both domestic and international , minority groups that you re not a member of , etc etc .","285774":"i was years old in , so i can t remember . i m sure there was more emphasis on face to face interaction , but online socialization is just as valid as irl socialization .","285775":"it s verbal harassment , so yeah .","285776":"eh , yes and no . there are obviously terrible things going on in the world , which is what the media primarily focuses on when reporting the news . however , there are also great advances in science , medicine , and technology that aren t reported upon nearly as often as the bad news .","285777":"i prefer mexican or any sort of spanish food over chinese food . chinese food is good comfort food , but there s nothing better than homemade cuban food from my boyfriend s father or grandmother after a long day .","285778":"we have a few pieces of art , but we haven t hung them up yet . i have a work of art hung in my room that was actually commissioned for me a few years ago .","285779":"my boyfriend s face .","285780":"well , my boyfriend i are leaving to go on vacation the day after valentine s day so i guess that counts ? lmaoo .","285781":"no , i absolutely hate grocery shopping . the store is always congested with other shoppers , and it makes me really overwhelmed .","285782":"cheeseburger sliders , mozzarella sticks , cheese crackers , and chips dip .","285783":"i ve never tried a meat pie before .","285784":"possession of illegal drugs and or drunk driving .","285785":"the number and the truman show with jim carrey . he s one of my favorite actors , and i prefer his dramatic roles over his comedic roles .","285786":"haha , no . i don t miss anyone from my past in general they re in the past for a reason , and i don t regret the friendships relationships that have ended , whether it was their fault or my fault or some sort of compromise in between .","285787":"i can say with confidence that cashiers give literally zero sh ts about what a customer is buying . when i worked as a cashier and in retail in general , i wasn t paying attention to the particular items as much as i was paying attention to whether or not the coupons correctly corresponded with whatever items they were for and if the item was on sale .","285788":"i honestly have zero clue . i don t own many things that are yellow , it isn t a color i like on myself .","285789":"that seems . . . counter productive ? the purpose of askfm is to ask and answer questions , and to unlock certain answers with coins seems pretty ridiculous to me . it prevents users from seeing answers , and therefore , gives less attention to users .","285790":"no , i m not close with my grandparents at all , and they re super close minded and conservative . we don t generally agree on a lot of things , and i only see them perhaps once per year around the holidays .","285791":"yeah , i used to play the sims a lot when i was much younger .","285792":"yeah , i personally believe that would be considered trolling activity . trolling is generally defined as posting something with the intention of angering or upsetting people , especially if you target a certain demographic with a controversial or demeaning post .","285793":"yeah , obesity is a major health concern in the united states . it s been studied upon frequently because of the prevalence of fast food and generally unhealthy food that a lot of people gravitate to .","285794":"for me , it s usually youtube and chill , lmaoo .","285795":"yeah , that s perfectly fine . it s very informal , but it s technically correct .","285796":"i ve been really nostalgic lately , and also nervous for my upcoming vacation for some reason . tonight is the type of night where i ll put on sad music just for the sake of making myself cry for some kind of release .","285797":"mayonnaise . it literally disgusts me anyway .","285798":"i was relieved when i left my previous jobs . my first job well , technically it was multiple jobs in one , just all within the same company was extremely overwhelming , stressful , and i wasn t respected , so i was very relieved when i quit that job . my job prior to my current job was also a relief when i quit , because there was also a lot of stress , extremely short and unrealistic deadlines , and irrational management . they favored certain people over others , and we were constantly being scrutinized . i miss my old coworkers from that job , but i still keep in touch with a few of them .","285799":"no , i didn t watch the superbowl . i don t like most sports .","285800":"i ve been more stable the past few days than i have been since my boyfriend s dog passed away , so yeah . i still have other personal concerns and dilemmas going on , so i have been a bit moody , but that isn t out of the ordinary for me .","285801":"my day has been going fine thus far . i was late to work this morning because of traffic , which wasn t too great , but the day was overall very productive . i got home from work about an hour ago , and i quickly did some dishes and took a long , hot shower . i m just relaxing on my laptop listening to music for now .","285802":"eh , i wouldn t pay anything more than for an entree . i feel like that s a bit too much , unless i wanted to really splurge on some sort of steak dish with multiple sides .","285803":"i never realized there were different types of coffee cakes , haha . i m not much of a fan of coffee cake in general , though .","285804":"besides my mental health , which is a chronic condition , then no . i don t have any physical health concerns at the moment .","285805":"for me personally , it s much easier to warm myself up when i m cold . you can layer on as many layers as you need . however , when it s too hot outside , there are only so many layers you can take off .","285806":"yeah , but only on floors of rooms i know are safe , like my bedroom floor , for example . and only if it s only been on the floor for less than seconds , lmaoo .","285807":"it s really compelling ! ! i watched the first season a while ago and enjoyed it , and the second season just came out .","285808":"they re equally as challenging . you cannot compare mental illness to physical illness because they both come with their own battles .","285809":"coffee motivates me to get out of bed in the morning most mornings , at least . sometimes there is no motivation whatsoever , but thankfully i haven t had a relapse in depression in a few months .","285810":"because i enjoy it . i do a lot of things that are bad for my health . having a drink once or twice per week isn t necessarily a bad thing , at any rate .","285811":"if you re asking if i drink alcohol , then yes .","285812":"not very often . this is the last photo i took sometime last week .","285813":"tbh , i never get that much money back whenever i file my taxes , and i m afraid to file my taxes this year because i did so much freelance work in . if anything , it would go towards my credit card bills and loans .","285814":"no , i ve never been fired from a job before . i ve given two weeks notice for every job i ve had and then quit thereafter .","285815":"it s nearly pm , and i m not even hungry so i don t know what i want to make for dinner yet . i ll probably just heat up some rice and vegetables , or i ll order takeout . i haven t had sushi in a while .","285816":"i m not in college . when i attended college , i studied professional writing , communications , and english literature .","285817":"shaving half of my head is one of the many rash decisions i have made for myself .","285818":"ah , well you re right at least you did your part . perhaps the future will hold a different story , but for now the only thing you can do is continue living your life .","285819":"probably , it s bound to get a bit chilly at night .","285820":"definitely not enough water , that s for certain . lmaoo . i ve been trying to drink more often , though . i ll have two big glasses when i get home from work , and i try to drink a thermos or two while i m working .","285821":"i am a killer on netflix . it s a documentary about inmates who have m rdered other people .","285822":"i haven t ! ! i didn t know a previous movie existed , haha .","285823":"i have a bachelor s degree in communications professional writing and a minor in english literature .","285824":"i don t really know the dynamic of your relationship , so saying it s been two days doesn t really mean much . for some people , two days is a lot , while for others , it s such a small increment of time . do what you think is best . if texting her after only two days is what you think is best , then try that . personally , i believe things are better discussed in person though ."}}
