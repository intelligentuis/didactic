  If you are still in high school party the fuck up. Make mistakes. Live it up. Because once you are out of it and actually accountable for shit, you gotta be careful. Just maintain good grades so you graduate but it truly does freak me out how to most people our rest of our lives is based on our teenage years and i dont agree with that at all. Theres so much living amd learning for people to do theres now way your life should be determined by your high school life. Have fun and enjoy the freedom of not actually being responsible for the things you do. Adulting is actually really hard. I remember when i was 17 i wanted to be an adult so bad i moved out and started taking care of myself - it wasnt easy at all and i ended up making stupid choices i wouldnt have made if i was still at home. So dont rush growing up, trust me theres DECADES where youlll have to be a grown ass adult - dont make your teen years.

  Its a beautiful place its like the Sun and the Earth had a big fat baby. The homes, my castle is gorgeous. Its made out of crystal and a mineral earth doesnt create, giserrila. It looks like as if glass had led lights in it. The secret to all our homes is that they are underground. And inside the planet is light blue as if we were looking at the sky. We are way more advanced than Earth. We have technology you couldn't ever dream of. Our air that we breath is our food and water, so we dont need to worry about eating or drinking and because of that we dont have waste. We have the ability to telepathically make molecules into whatever we want. Lets say i want to make a chair, i can telepathically force molecules to combine to create a chair, exactly how i created it. The part of Saturn im queen of is the fun, goofing around side. The side thats living in a huge party. But i do have to go to the other side because we have to protect your planet from being destroyed by the nebulans.. which is the whole reason im on earth.. when i could be basically living in a crystal ball with real magic powers.  I miss seeing zeciro jumping into a water park pool, which is as big as earth, and they always come out shaking their little butts. Life is good in my kingdom

  Freedom of choice is pretty sweet. Not saying we have it perfect, theres a lot of things that need to be fixed.
  
  But if you want to shove dick down your throat - you can and nobody will stop you.
  
  If you wanna consume all drugs - you can.
  
  You can dress however you like.
  
  You can talk however you like.
  
  You can eat whatever you want.
  
  You can be whoever you want.
  
  You can create art however you like.
  
  Theres really no limits as long as you arent hurting anyone else.
  
  You even have the choice to hurt yourself if you want.

   Hey guys and squad! :) 
Here your question: What's your point of view about life? Feel free to go into details.

-Stay classy awesome peeps-
  ","
  I honestly believe people should live their lives how they want too. No matter what it is. If you want to travel the world, travel it. If you want to shoot up heroin, shoot up. We deserve to live life freely. Thats the beauty of life.
  
  People need to stop arguing about whos right and whos wrong. People need to stop worrying about what others do, say, or think. Surround yourself with people who enrich your life in the ways you think your life needs enrichment.
  
  I dont believe theres a right way to live or a wrong way. Of course people who love touching children and murdering people are gonna be a different story but thats about it.
  
  People need to wake up, do what makes themselves happy (as long as they are harming others) and live their lives. End of story.
  
  People need to stop trying to prove to other people that their lives are the right ones to live - just fuckin live it and shut up.

But people dont get past the face for some reason. And ive noticed its the people with insecurities that only choose crushes that are really really good looking. As if their crush will show how ugly they are if the celebrity isnt attractive. But its not about looks for me, i dont really give a shit about looks the older i get.

  Too me it doesnt feel that fast because i was the generation that was born like right in the beginning of it starting to go super quickly. The generation after me (the people in high school now) they kinda have no idea what life was like before all this technology so they think its normal.
  
  The generation before me (people born in the 80s or before) experience the speed of technology. My siblings are still in complete shock with where are world is now. And dont even get me started with my parents.. they cannot believe what we are capable of doing, they thought microwaves were a huge deal ??

   Why does it annoy men when older women dress young for their age or when fat women wear outfits that only look good on healthy sized women? I'm 21 and overweight but I don't wear tight fitting clothing or skinny jeans, I wear baggy clothing because no one wants to see my fat.
  ","
  This is a really hard question for me to answer because 1. Im not a male. 2. I dont think i have the right to assume what others are thinking. 3. It confuses me when people wear clothes that dont look good on them, as if they dont know what their body looks like.
  
  Speaking of you, you dont have to wear super baggy clothes.. just dont wear things that are super tight. They have super cute dresses for people who are a little bigger. I like it when someone whos kinda thicker wears a flowly dress with cute little booties.

   Share something artistic that you have created.
  ","
  I wrote this poem in 2015. Its called Sometimes;
  
  Sometimes, I get these thoughts.
  
  Thoughts, that can become so vivid.
  
  Sometimes, I think they are too real.
  
  Real, in a sense I can feel the emotion to an extreme extent.
  
  Sometimes, it leaves me broken.
  
  Broken, like the freshly cracked glass around my heart.
  
  Sometimes, I think I’ll never get those pieces back.
  
  Back, in the happier days I was living a fairy tale.
  
  Sometimes, I still believe in magic.
  
  Magic, what really happened that night.
  
  Sometimes, I play the memory in my head on repeat.
  
  Repeat, is how my soul felt when I laid eyes on him.
  
  Sometimes, I hope he really is my soulmate.
  
  Soulmate, someone you love in every life.
  
  Sometimes, I wonder it its true.
  
  True, that some people are just meant to be.
  
  Sometimes, I start to think I’m delusional.
  
  Delusional, a distortion of reality.
  
  Sometimes,
  
  Sometimes,
  
  I think to much.

  I fucking hate when people say ""get a life"" are you implying im not living? That i wasnt born and im not breathing? Am i a ghost? Or that theres a certain way to live life? Because it doesnt matter what a person does, its still their fuckin life. Maybe the way i live my life isnt up to standards to how you want to live, by why the fuck do you care YOU ARENT LIVING MY LIFE. Worry about your own life, cause clearly if you have enough time to judge mine you obviously arent living your life right.

  I learned that i needed a lot of healing, like mental healing. I was in psychological pain, there was something subconsciously hurting me. I learned that no matter how hard i tried to make myself look like i was confident, i hated myself down to every single cell of my body. And i needed to learn to love myself, because if i dont love myself - how could someone else. I learned that i have a beautiful imagination, that i can feel things deeper than most people and im a lot stronger than i ever believed. I learned that i was capable of so much more than i was giving, i had potential to offer this world. I learned that those who called me worthless were intimidated by me and were making sure to bring me down to their level, so i wasnt becoming the person i should be.

Here your question: What's your story? Feel free to go into details.

-Embrace Yourself-
  ","
  I was adopted into a very well to do family. I have two older siblings, which made growing up super fun for me. I had a nanny till i was 4 years old, and because of her i met my best friend because my nanny was their maids best friend so she would bring me over and thats how our lifetime friendship has started! I sadly didnt have a mom really, she stopped being a parent to all of us. My dad was never around, he was constantly working. Luckily, i had my brother and sister who always were there, and my neighbors who all had kids the same age as me.
  
  I went to a school that was filled with millionaires/billionaires. A lot of my friends had a tough time fitting in, either they werent wearing oufits worth $500 everyday or they were just kinda weird but for me i was pretty much accepted by everyone and because of that i was friends with everybody. Ive always been that really shy kid who just happened to be super adorable. School was easy for me, which lead me to just not try and slack off all the time. I didnt find out till later that i was actually considered popular lol.
  
  My home life was hard tho. My brother was my best friend but my dad thought i was stupid because i wasnt trying that hard in school. I was just getting by, and my teachers always told him im super smart, i just rather talk to other students.
  
  I remember my first bf was a model and in commercials. We were in 4th grade but i actually went to his house and shit haha
  
  High school for me was a journey of heart break, depression, and partying/drugs. Nothing about high school was really easy, except my grades. But i was way too focused on doing drugs and hanging out with friends and scoring the hottest guy at school. Graduating high school was the most shocking thing for everyone i grew up with, because i was just the definition of REBEL.
  
  When i got my first job, it was the best experience ever. Granted i only got hired because ""i was insanely beautiful"" but it ended up being the best time of my life.

  Ive had friends who were 110% sure i could communicate telepathically lol because i was capable of saying exactly what they were thinking that moment, and it wasnt like 1 time.. it happened at least 50 times in a day.

  "
628877,"
   I have mixed feelings about being clairaudient, sometimes I either wish I was clairvoyant or nothing at all as it causes spirits to become frustrated that I can't see them, but can only hear them. Though having said that, I witnessed my first one only yesterday I think - I'm still uncertain!

  I feel like its necessary in the sense of keeping people from killing and stealing from each other. Also this world is filled with leaders and followers. Every leader needs followers. Its kinda just human nature for us to have religion, even if we didnt have the religion we had today - we would still have some other religion. Its just psychological. People need to feel purpose.

  Ok so for my 18th birthday i went a rave, Hard Summer, with my sister. And it was the best time of my life. Well there was this guy with his group of friends across the audience. We didnt know each other but we looked each other and pointed and met each other in the middle like we knew each other. He was soooo attractive like unbelievable. He puts me on his shoulders, we dance together, makeout. All his friends were like giving him gestures that i was hot, even the girls were obsessed with me. Well they decide to leave and the girls were like ""are you coming with"" and since i was with my sister, i said no. But from then on i was hooked on raves. I felt so free. You free real freedom at raves.

  Why are you pretending you have any idea what ive been through? You have no idea about my life or what ive gone through. What if i might have seen people blown up in front of me? What if inwas kidnapped? What if i was a hostage? You have no idea. How dare you say things like this. You are a perfect example of someone who helps people who want to commit suicide. Ive gone to therapy for over a year and half for ptsd. Ive had it since i was 17 years old but wasnt fully diagnosed till i was 19. It was the reason why i was doing so many drugs. It was the reason why i was 74 lbs. almost destroyed all my relationships with my family because of it. The fact you think im using ptsd to get attention is sickening, its the most difficult thing ive ever gone through. It has ripped years away from my life. My life isnt perfect, im not perfect.

   Thoughts on Love?
  ","
  Love is the closest thing we have to magic.
  
  Its capable of taking away pain, making you feel like you can fly, you can comprehend the world and achieve greatness.
  
  Lots of people believe theyve felt love, but its one of those feelings thats so overwhelming that you truly feel like your soul has been lifted. That everything is finally ok. You actually feel like the world is spinning for you.
  
  If you havent felt this deep tingling feeling in your chest or a thousand butterflies in your stomach, you havent experienced love yet.
  
  If you havent come to terms with death and have said ""im no longer afraid because i have felt love"" then you havent felt love yet.

  1. They cant afford a 4 year college

   how do u get ur skin so clear tho? :O
  ","
  When i was younger like from 12-16 i had really bad acne, like it was terrible. I use to wear a lot of foundation to cover it up (used clinque), i also did lot of sports so id wash my face in the morning, and when i came home from school/sports (used Neutrogena) but nothing was working. When i was a senior i lived with my brother and he had this apricot scrub i started to use that and i started to use Olay face lotion with sunscreen. My face cleared up. For foundation i switched to Neutrogena which helped as well, and that helped. The secret for my skin was using face lotion WITH sunscreen.

  They've done experiments about this with kids, and from what I've seen it can influence a way a person acts. You can guess what shows a kid grew up watching based on the personality they have as an adult. Now, with more aggressive shows and movies, a child can become more aggressive after. But i think its really based on the child themselves and how they react to something. Television really influences kids more than adults.

  Dear my favorite people,
  
  Thank you so much for always putting a smile on my face. For knowing that when im sad all i want is for a person to make me laugh instead of asking if im ok and trying to tell me how not to be sad. Thank you for making me feel like 1 in a million with all your compliments and praises. For constantly telling me what my strengths are, how im capable of doing anything, how special i am, and that im intelligent. Thank you for bringing out the best in me by being the best. Thank you for being chill, drama free, fun, loving, trustworthy, and caring. Thank you for never giving up on me and pushing me forward. I love you all of you, the best people ive ever met.

  Omg, im gonna tell you my dream i had last night. It was fucking weird.
  
  Ok so i had to get some sort of surgical procedure so the nurse started putting numbing stuff all over my chest at first. I started to feel really weird, my face felt like it was starting to sag which i guess was suppose to happen. This procedure you can be awake to have it done well in my dream i blacked out and then i woke up with little wires sticking out from my heart, my intestines, and my thigh. And they had to do one more into my lung so i got to be awake for that and i saw them shove this long medal wire into my side. Having no idea what the fuck this was all for. Then i had to walk home.. numb, unable to feel any part of my body. With wires sticking out of me.. then there was this middle school boy he comes up to me and goes,""you had the surgery... ill help you home."" And he walks me all the way home.. but his mom sees freaks out and says he cant be around that monster. Then i look at myself in the mirror and i look amazing, and i think i need to take a selfie, my face is on point. Then i told the boy to go home, i can get home and he goes, ""ill see you again savannah. I promise"" had no idea how he knew my name.. then i woke up.

  ","
  What you need to understand is a person can do what they wish on their own page. If she doesnt want to answer, she doesnt have too. You are not entitled and its not required. & idk if you noticed but a lot people on ask actually like seeing random shit, kinda makes it into a very interactive blog.

   God is superior sure when Satan was kicked out of heaven God could have destroyed him but God was lonely so he created  a man and a woman they sinned God gives us a mind He doesn't control us we decide what we want to do good or bad the end result if we die in our sins we go to Hell if we accept

   He is all powerful He had no idea that Satan was going to rebel against Him nor did He know that Adam and Eve were going to do what they did heaven is real someday when we all die its either Hell or Heaven

  Its not real like its just not.
  
  Also, God is all knowing and all powerful. He knows the decisions we are going to make. With that being said he KNEW the choice that satan was gonna make and adam and eve. The fact you think he didnt know kinda proves that you dont understand what being superior means.  He has everything all figured out. So like when you pray for something its either already his plan or its not. Hes not gonna change it just cause you asked him too. So my point, he knew what satan was gonna do but decided to just be like ahhh fuck it, Free will.

   Is God Jesus? If He is then there is no Trinity
  ","
  Heres what im trying to understand, so God this superior being decides that he needs to essentially possess a human to make people follow after him. So he creates a son (even though we are all his children) that is actually just him in human form but first he had to go down to earth as God and impregnate someone (even though he made adam out of sand or whatever) so he could have his son (him) born. And send himself on a suicide mission thats gonna be the most painful experience ever but its ok cause God is doing it to himself and he will just rise himself in 3 days but only let 12 disciples see it and its all just to show people that he died for everybody's sins so we must love him unless you sin then he will punish you even tho he is all forgiving and loving... am i the only one who sees the utter bullshit?

   What's your favorite movie quote?
  ","
  This is my fav quote ever, which is why the first line i have tattooed on my forearm ;
  
  ""They never planned for the future. They weren't supposed to get old and we were never supposed to grow up. The lost, the unwanted, and the abused came here with the purest of intentions, to build a place where there would be no rules, other than a peaceful existence. There are no couples for them. For them, there is only the moment. They tried to raise us to be perfect in their perfect new world and for a moment, maybe it worked. But I think they finally saw their own shortsightedness and failure in us. We always saw it in them. They attempted to unlearn jealousy, want, and hate, to not possess anything, including each other. They tried to free themselves from materialism, but soon they were drowning in it. Finally, we all saw failure in each other and everyone was looking for a way out."" - Happiness Runs

  What makes me feel loved is when someone comes to me and says, ""i thought of you and so i bought this for you"" or when they bring me my fav food. Or when someone messages me saying they were thinking of me and wanted to know how im doing. Stuff like that makes me feel loved.

   Why the fuck did Hustler offer a contract at age 16? That doesn't sound legal at all.
  ","
  Youre right, it wasnt legal whatsoever. But offering a contract is very different than signing one, which would be extremely illegal.
  
  I used to go to the Hustler store a lot because theres a huge one in san diego, they thought since i was with a bunch of people in their 20s, that i must have been in my 20s as well. So the guy who did management for modeling came up to me and asked if i wanted too and i had to tell him i was 16 lol he couldnt believe it. But now people cant believe im actually in my 20s, LIKE WHAT THE FUCK.

Here your question: How would you define ""freedom""? If you want go into details.
  ","
  Freedom is being to choose who you should love. Freedom is being about to follow your dreams and find your passion. Freedom is being able to form your own beliefs and opinions without being killed. Freedom is being able to make good or bad decisions for yourself. But freedom is never free, freedom is given from ones who sacrifice themselves so everyone else can have those pleasures. Freedom is fought with blood, sweat, and tears.

   Yeah,it was even harder when I was 15,most tattoo parlors didn't allow you to have tattoos until you reached the age of 18.But like I said,while it's not common to see 15-year olds with tattoos,it's totally uncommon and not all of them are gang members.
  ","
  Tattoo parlors are super strict here, like you cant be younger than 18. Like they photocopy your id and shit or they will get shut down.
  
  People who are getting them at 15 are getting parental consent or not going to a parlor to get them.
  
  The schools dont allow them, even if you cover them up. Its just not appropriate.  Theres private schools that dont allow piercings either.
  
  Its pretty fuckin rare to see a 15 year old with tattoos lol theres really not that many parents who would allow that.

  1. My parents would never let me have tattoos at 15, and in the time i was actually 15 - it was hard to get tattoos and its stupid to get a tattoo from someone who isnt an artist.
  
  2. All the schools i went too, its against the rules to have tattoos. You would have had to go to a shitty school if you had tattoos. I wasnt gonna be stupid and do that.
  
  3. The only people i know who were 15 with tats, were gang members but they all got kicked out of my school.

  Omg i heard about this, ok so like what cracks me up is literally a week before this shit hits the fan i heard a radio broadcast of someone talking about Amazon and how amazing they are for inventing a way for them to track what you look up and they made sure that the ads you see are something you would like based on the previous shopping you do, all the taxes blah blah blah then A WEEK LATER they get in so much trouble for it and its this fuckers fault for saying anything like if they just kept their mouths shut nobody would have known they were doing this cause they have been doing it for YEARS.

  And because of this we had a falling out because she wouldnt let me around her bf (now husband) because she was afraid i was gonna charm him into like me and she would be compared to me.
  
  She also wasnt wrong about this, ive gone through life being shocked by how easily i can smile and twinkle my eyes at someone and they are just bewitched. People i would never believe i would seduce them without even trying.

  I feel like being a parent is harder because with siblings you can kinda be straight up with them and for the most part they grew up around you and understand the society they were raised in. Parents usually are stuck in the society they grew up in so its hard for them to understand what a kid is truly going through because things are always changing and if you dont change quick enough, you wont catch up.
