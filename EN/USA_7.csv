  Yes! We must do our best to not spread the virus and try our best to stay at home and do our everyday health routines. Always wash your hands multiple times throughout the day.

Sanitize platforms and anything that you touch before and after. Try to wear a mask and gloves if you can and more.

   Hello how are you I hope you are doing okay with all this craziness going on
  ","
  Yeah. I'm doing okay.
  
  I had a really bad day yesterday at work.
  
  I had people screaming at me over bread. There's a limit on the bread and this lady wanted to get six and I can't give her more because last time I gave someone one more I got in trouble. But yeah she tried to get more and I had to tell her she couldn't get it because my upper management told me no. So she started going off on me. Taking it out on me when it wasn't even my fault. I know that she needed them but we had a rule that only a limited 2 per customer any kind of bread it didn't matter if it was different kind like hamburger, hot dog buns, or loaf bread. But yeah I had about around three or four customers that got aggravated. It really made me mentally exhausted. I ended up going home early because I was just still upset and really tired from all of it.. It is definitely been crazy. I'm really ready for all of this covid-19 stuff to be done. 2020 was supposed to be dedicated to adventuring and traveling and so far I haven't been able to do anything much. It's really upsetting because I love to do these things. It's okay though. We will get through it. But thanks for asking. I hope that everything is okay with you and that everyone is healthy.

  I do but I've been being careful with what I have been wearing lately because of all this covid-19 because when I get home I immediately try to clean and wash away anything just in case if it has came in contact. A lot of the things that I wear on my wrist mean a lot to me so I don't want to expose it to anything. Just taking a precaution. Probably something I needed but I don't know. I just don't want to be sorry in the end. I guess I'm just being cautious more or less.

  I have answered many forms of this question and I always say the same thing. You two should always talk together about things if you're questioning things. That's what relationships are about.  working together and talking things out. Communication. Constant communication. Not partly.

   What was one of the best days of your life? ? ?
  ","
  Learning how to ride my bike for the 1st time. Falling and getting up. I remember my mama and my step telling me to ride in the grass so if I fell I would fall on the grass and not skinned my knee and arms up. I remember going so fast that I busted one of the training wheels off and that's how I learned how to ride.
  
  I remember learning how to play baseball for the first time and basketball.
  
  My sister Samantha teaching me how to skateboard for the first time.
  
  Rollerblading and then ice skating eventually too. 1st learning.
  
  Cooking with my mom and my grandparents anytime. Best day.
  
  Many different birthdays and different events when I was younger. And one's today.
  
  My 10th birthday.
  
  Graduating 8th grade. ❤
  
  Easter egg hunts with my cousins and sisters.
  
  School field trips.
  
  Swimming in the pool and jumping on the trampoline with my sisters.
  
  My sister Emily always experimenting with different types of hairstyles with my hair. Because it was so long. Looking in the mirror and seeing how well she did even though she was only 8-12 years old.
  
  Me and my sister Samantha always singing together in her room. I remember me standing on the chair and pretending that I was on stage and singing in front of hundreds of people. Thousands. Her teaching me a few pointers on my voice.
  
  I remember growing up with Angel. She was the best darn dog ever. That was my mom has baby. Me and her share the same birthday. she was one year older than me.
  
  Graduating high school when they said I wouldn't make it.
  
  Not only being in the church choir but leading it. Especially when they thought I would never do that.
  
  Those were the good days. In the old days. These were the best darn days of my life.

  "
37796,"
   You don't have to answer it too personal but has there ever been a moment where you thought your relationship was going to end? And how did you solve that problem and stay together?
  ","
  No not really but if I did feel like it was going to end and for a stupid reason that I would just go ahead and end it because it's not worth saving. But I'm not sure what's going on with your situation so I'm not sure how to answer it. Hopefully everything works out for the best. Whether is the best to come apart from each other or whether it's good to stay together. Best luck.

   Lovely pic ! And soup sounds good to me ? depending on flavour choice of course :)
  ","
  What do you like? I like almost about any type of soup.
  
  I am honestly not a fan of taco soup unless I am the one making it. A lot of people make it very strong tasting and I don't like that. Taco flavor is very very strong. It has to be kind of send out in my opinion. If it's a super duper taco flavored then after three bites I'm like I can't have no more. Very rich in tasting.
  
  But I love a gumbo. Of any kind.
  
  Broccoli cheddar soup is delicious!
  
  Potato celery soup is good.
  
  Shrimp and corn soup is probably one of my most favorite because you can put many different types of cream of soups in it to make it flavorful. I like to make this soup real thick
  
  Chicken and dumpling soup is so so good!
  
  Regular chicken soup is good as well. You can also make it with the bones and you can make it boneless.
  
  Beef tip soup is good as well. Especially when you just have a tasting like beef soup and then sometimes when you add different types of tomatoes.
  
  Oxtail soup is great! You have to really cook down the oxtail before putting it into the soup because oxtail is very tough you have to really marinate and tenderize the oxtail. But it's really good. It almost has the texture of tough tough beef. Like a ribeye kind've. Very tasty indeed. I say...  Don't knock it unless you've tried it.
  
  3 bean soup is cheap and good and is good for hard times when you don't have a lot of money.
  
  Red beans and rice! Can be watered down to a soup. Very good!
  
  And these are just a few. There are so many more.

It's a lot of fun seeing smiles on people's face but it's also really hard seeing them going through those things. Especially when it randomly happen to them, it could happen to us. Any of us. Some of the situations. It really makes you rethink everything. Really makes you appreciate what we have.
  
  And I also have helped the natural disaster thing also. I have myself went into houses and help people savage what they could. I have helped people with floods of almost 40 ft. It's scary. I've been through Katrina, Rita, Gustav and many more other hurricanes. Tornadoes. It's nuts. Real.

   I heard that ants don't like citrus smells or flavors so if you have an ant problem in your house or in your car and you don't want to resolve to using poison maybe try sprays that have citrus smells in them. Spray them in the cracks of your car and maybe even put a little bit in your cleaner or use a citrus smelling cleaner and clean your truck or house with it. Maybe get some sitrus smelling wax melts and have them going by your front door. After all they smell good anyway. At least your visitors will have a good aroma when they walk in the house.

  I would start up a food bank and a side natural disaster team. A team that would go and help go in and people when tornadoes,hurricanes or floods happened or any type of natural disaster for that matter. And if they needed us to supply them with food, water, clothing or some where to stay, we got them. But at the same time they have to make an effort to try to start over again. And we got them there too. Help them with getting new jobs places food and the things they need all over again. Help guide and re-establish. We also would try to provide classes for them to help them turn around. With all of this going on in their lives I'm sure that they would have some sort of depression. We would try to give them that boost again.

   Do you often use the voice recorder?
  ","
  On our paranormal explorations? Absolutely. Very often. We use, what are called EVP recorders. These are very small skinny recording devices that are very sensitive to hearing. Very good for hearing abnormal sounds. Sounds that the human ears can't hear. Sounds that are so quiet that only the record can hear. You have to be careful and try not to breathe too hard when you're using it. Because it can detect even the sounds of your breath. Or try not to make any type of sudden movements or walking. It can hear a pin drop for sure. Even if you were to wave your hand around the area could hear the air moving.

  We want so much more for us. Yet we can only do so much.
  
  Wedding dresses are so expensive also. I never went to my own prom because it was just so expensive. People were paying for senior and Junior Rings almost $1,000 a piece... and prom dresses that worth thousands of dollars and graduation dresses the same. I just did not have all that kind of money... It was not that important to me to look stylish and high grade. I knew how much the situations/moments meant to me. I did not need to express them through expensive dress wear. Especially something and I'm probably only going to wear once or twice in my life and then it's going to hang in my closet for the rest of eternity or given to someone else.
  
  I do not judge other people for wanting to do this. If you have the money I would definitely do it! But I do not have the kind of money to pay for such expensive wear for such events. And that's okay. I am happy no matter what. Because I love him. I'm not here for all of that. And that beautiful blouse I still have in my closet and I love very much. Every time I wear it or hold it it makes me cry because I love it so much. I remember that day. Getting to tell him that I was going to be with him for the rest of my life. I never more made a better decision. No regrets. My life. No never. I am happy. Yes. Very. ?❤

  It's crazy to know that all these people are buying all these cleaning supplies and soaps like they've never washed their hands before.
  
  I always have a bar of soap, regular liquid soap and a thing of hand sanitizer by our sinks and our house. Why so many different things? Because different people prefer different things when they are washing their hands. Some people like bar soap and some people like liquid soap and then even after washing your hands I like to sanitize my hands. Was never different, never changed. Always the same. Still is. In my house. I even have a thing of wipes nearby is somebody for first just a hand wipe or something instead of a hand sanitizer considering sometimes it drys your hands out.
  
  Always had a ton of bottles next to my toilet to clean the toilet throughout the day. Never understood why these people are buying all these Lysol cans and Clorox like they have never cleaned their bathroom before? Very confusing...
  
  And then lastly all these people buying all this bathroom tissue. T p. They aren't sharing. They don't need 25 things toilet paper. Now people that really are running out of bath tissue don't have anymore at all. And now they're buying all the paper towels. All this sickness stuff is just going to show how selfish people really are. We definitely should be taking precaution but we shouldn't be buying absolutely everything in their stores and hoarding it in our houses with only a few people in it.

  I am honestly from south Louisiana and I don't understand it either. The state is getting shut down and everyone's having to stay quarantine. It makes no sense to me because we were one of the last states to get cases and now all the sudden we're being shut down and are in the red for being one of the states that have the most. It just doesn't make a lot of sense to me honestly.

  Of course they always keep all services everywhere in the store cleaned constantly, multiple times throughout the day and now we do it even more. But there's no cases around where we're at, so we are not wearing masks really yet. There are a few people that are but those are people that are being told by their doctors to wear them now always. But there aren't a lot of them even wearing. And the one I have is big and flashy so I'm going to wait until we get more cases to wear it so I don't look like I am overreacting. That is what people are making it seem like and honestly it's not.... we are honestly just taking precaution and being careful. I have a grandparent that lives with us and they cannot handle this virus. It's perfectly understandable to wear a mask but under certain circumstances atm with this stuff going around. I'm trying not to make our customers panic at the same time. Wearing a mask makes them panicked. So yeah. Just being careful. They are not requiring us to wear masks at in our workplace. We are kind've wearing gloves.

So bad that they have to go on that person's account and block you. And if that person's okay with it then they both need to not be in your life. They're not meant to be in your life

It's also very intriguing and interesting to learn about. Not a lot of people take on this challenge. It's very scary and can be very dangerous. But you definitely have to know what you're doing.

Learn go online and research things. Start a new series on Netflix or something. Learn to play an instrument. Develop a new hobby. Sing. Entertain one another and play with sisters and brothers and animals around the house. Joke around. Play Uno cards charades. Maybe work out at your house. Build something or paint.

  Definitely at a few stores. A lot of times a lot of people are very unappreciative towards me they're not appreciated of the things that I do. But sometimes people don't know how to to show their appreciation for someone. They don't know any better. Or they show it in a way that is different or not very clear.

Everybody's been wearing masks at work because we have so many people that come in... So yeah. We have been cleaning areas and surfaces even more than we did before.

  Right now everyone's life is getting put on hold because of all of this coronavirus stuff. So I think that is definitely something that has became popular that is ruining a lot of things. People are not being able to go back to school because they're canceling some kids schools for the rest of the year. So these seniors are not going to not get to experience the rest of their senior year. They are getting things taken from them and it's really sad. I hope that I answered your question correctly.

  I honestly don't mind cranberry juice mixed with vodka. When I do go to the bar, the one I usually go to is in Louisiana and she usually makes me some diesel orange juice cranberry juice and she puts some other stuff in it I think she put some lemon juice. I can't exactly remember. All I know is it tastes good. It's very potent. It is not give me a hangover like you probably would other people. She does not understand how I drink for five glasses of it but I do. LOL and I'm still good. When we go up there we usually playing pool.

  Helping this one person that could not be helped. I tried for years. Wasted a lot of time.
  
  Realizing that not all these people can be helped. Some people are unhelpable. Some people are stubborn and let some words go in one ear and out the other. They want everyone to listen to them but then when you talk they don't want to listen.
  
  But in the end I do feel like I might have helped them a little bit... who honestly knows. I feel that I made a bad decision by sticking around but at the same time who knows if I really did make a bad decision there. I may have helped you just don't realize. But I go with it as a bad decision.

  That is definitely strange considering the only way that she could call your mom her mother-in-law is if you two were married. That definitely looks like a sign ooor like she's just being friendly towards your mom and is trying to make it seem like she's like family because she really likes your mom. But I don't know because I'm not there.
  
  Is she showing maybe in any way shape or form any type of flirting signs that you? because theen.. more than likely that could definitely her throwing signs at you.

   What do girls think of guys giving them rings while being asked out? Maybe a romantic commitment? What would you think about the ring?
  ","
  Depends on the girl. That's the answer.
  
  I could like it and the other girl could not like it or another girl could not like it in another five girls could like it and then another 20 girls could think is awesome and then one girl could think it's really weird?! ? It's literally unpredicted on what a girl exactly want/like unless you actually do it and find out yourself. Or you ask her what she likes but it's supposed to be a surprise. You don't want to be expected. You just need to have a lot of confidence in yourself. Just go with it. If she doesn't want kids and maybe she's not the kind of girl for you. There's also a way you can go about it too but it doesn't mean that she still might not think it's weird. But I honestly wouldn't think that's a bad gesture, just depends on how you feel about it of course. You guys are definitely Young. Definitely don't make it seem like you are proposing to her. Because then three weeks later you find out that you did the wrong thing and they turn out to be crazy and you get stuck lol. Just make it literally 100% a commitment ring. Like a promise ring in a way. You really need to be serious about it tho. Her. Like... if you are going to make that commitment say that you need to live up to it. She also needs to understand that you're not around playing games and that she needs to be on board like you are. She doesn't exactly have to have to make the same commitment but you would like her to try to be on board about it. But this is like I always tell everyone. You're young. Don't take it fast. Be one day at a time with her. Because then one day if you do make it with her and y'all are married and having kids y'all are going to wish that you guys left that first stage last longer.

   Thoughts on this coronavirus? ?
  ","
  People are being too much about it buying absolutely everything in the store and being greedy and not leaving some items for other people. Like today we have someone coming I think they bought 75 to 100 things of Clorox. Now I don't understand that at all? Why does one person need that in their house... I definitely think people need to be more cleaner considering how much cleaning supplies have been bought since this outbreak. I almost feel like they haven't been cleaning themselves the whole time. Because I always buy hand sanitizers, soaps, different types of disinfectant sprays and wet wipes and toilet paper. It kind of makes me wonder if they've been doing the same or have they not?

  I mean what is there not to like question mark is really the question. I honestly couldn't think of anything.
  
  He's always just looking after me and making sure I'm okay. Always protecting me no matter what. Always knows what's important and sticks to it. Wants to have a family with me and raise them together. Wants the world for me. He spoils me. I try to do the same back as well as much as I can. He's always making sure I'm good and got everything I need. Is always cuddling me and trying to cheer me up when I am feeling down. Is always trying to do special things for me. I love it when I cook for him and he compliments my dinner. I also love seeing the smile on his face when he tries my food. I also love when he helps me clean after. Just really goes to show that he wants me to do it all over again and that it was good. I love it when he cooks with me. He is extremely smart. Just naturally knows how to do things and fix things. He is a very very good with people. Very talented and skilled full. Very good add cooking and building things.  of course he's very very sweet and extremely handsome. He is tall and strong. I trust him with the world and he is literally my best friend. I fought for the world for him. If you remember, me and him for the longest were in a long distance relationship to four and a half years so you can definitely see what I mean by he is literally my everything.

  I absolutely agree with this comment. A lot of people think everyone is weird for being themselves and doing the right thing. A lot of people get shamed for doing the right thing and maybe not always agreeing with the ""cool kids."" They always down people for that. But then one day you hear that those people didn't make it... and something happened to them... Well then the question arises. Why didn't we listen to them? But that was the lame person remember? Never put someone down for their gut feeling. Because you never know the person that is being ""lame"" might be making a life saving decision. By the way the lame person is symbolizing the person being their selves and following their gut feeling. A person that might not be wanting to take that risk for a reason. A risk is a risk. But some people want to live longer. They might take more risks than others. Considering like I said a risk is a risk. Doesn't always mean you might make it. You only live once. But really... you only live once. 1 time. You go. You done. So Choose Wisely with the decisions you make. Don't pressure someone else into doing something because their gut feeling tells them not to. Because at the end of the day. They could be right. And maybe you should have followed them.

  ","
  Yeah. I regularly probably wash my hands around 12-15 times a day and now I'm doing it even more. 20 to 30 times.  And even after I wash my hands I try not to touch my face too much. Considering its pollen season as well here.
  
  Definitely try not to touch your face or get in anyone's face for the next couple of months. Try to keep a distance of 4 to 6 feet or more from someone unless you're in a car of course. I would not get into a enclosed facility with alot of people really for too long.... if you're in a car with a few people especially people you don't know or see a lot maybe ride with the windows down. For the next few months... These are the kind of things we need to watch out for...
  
  People are traveling and going to different places. They don't understand when they go a few miles away from where they are used to and their environment, their body has to adapt to it. Especially if they go almost a hundred or two hundred or even more miles away from their original used to environment.... That is one thing that can make you sick is if your immune system is not at a key with the new environment you are in.
  
  Atm.. people just need to kind of be chilling at home and try not spread bacteria around person to person especially.
  
  But people do not need to go in the stores and buy everything. They need to share these items. You only need one or two I saw cans of Lysol in your house. I have seen people grab 10 are more cans. That is selfish. Then other people can't get a can if they need it. Especially people that are dealing with sicknesses and their houses. Or maybe people that just want to clean their house. Or people that just use Lysol cans on a daily basis. They can't get a can because you decide to take them all for just yourself. Especially if it's just you you only need one can. Not 10 not 20 not all of them.
  
  Same as any other item. We need to share these items. Not buy them all for ourselves. Help others be safe and prepare.

  Just a fruit diet for an entire month would actually not be the greatest for a human being considering juices are full of acids and sugars and a lot of acidic juices and sugars can mess up your teeth and fruit are the same full of acids and juices and sugars. Even though fruit is good for you it still contains natural sugars so you're still eating sugar. It's good to eat it in moderation because it is good for you because it's natural and has natural juices and sugar but to only eat for an entire month would be a treat for sure but it would exactly not be the greatest for somebody. But yeah fruit is good. But yeah fruit is good and I try to eat a decent amount of it but not too too much. It's a better choice over a sweet junk food snack.

  Some really bad cooking. But it's all good. As long as it won't kill me I will try it. I will not be rude about it. I can't stand plain tasting food. I am always trying to critique the flavors of the dishes I make so people never have to pick up the sugar, pepper, salt, hot sauce. But then again everybody has preference. Some people don't like your food salted at all and some people like their food super salted. So I never win.

  ","
  Honestly this is what they're doing. They have been shutting down schools different types of businesses. People are not allowed to go to concerts or places with over a 100-250 people. Schools have extended spring break and even when they return to school they're only going to be schooling online. Some schools have been shut down for the rest of the month if not longer. I heard some schools are going to be closed for the next four to six weeks...
  
  That's why everyone I think is buying all of the stuff in the stores is because they think that the industries are not going to deliver anymore or something? Or for awhile... Because of course some of them are closing but I'm not sure if all of them are? But people have been buying all of the bread and buying a lot of meat they're buying all the water, baby formula...toilet paper.. paper towels...napkins and just any type of tp type things.. Clorox...Germ X and hand sanitizers an type of baby wipes they are buying all of that any type of soap... even dish soap?! buying all the juice and gatorade... any type of cleaning or Lysol type stuff. People are fighting over Germ X bottles?!? Some people are going as far as selling multiple Germ X bottles online. Going for hundreds of dollars and it's only like 4 to 12 bottles. Some toilet paper is even going for 25 to $40 a pack online... 100 bucks?! I'm sure some! I work at a local grocery and literally all day the lines have been backed up and ginormous buggies have been coming through. We literally ran out of buggies and had no buggies available for most of the time. Walmart's have been completely wiped just any type of cleaning TP products. Places are completely out of water. Lowe's stores are completely out of water. It is definitely being taken way out of hand. I completely understand being prepared and making sure you are cleaning you're self so you are well. But at the same time we should always be washing our hands & keeping clean no matter what's going on.

You would have to pay a decent price to be able to stay at this hotel but you would have a lot of fun when you did stay. And you can party and everything but any type of damage to the rooms you would have to pay for completely. But I would probably have anywhere from 25 to 50 floors to pending. Because considering some games have gotten way more huge than others I would probably have more than one floor per those types of games. Like for instance games like Mario Halo for the Call of Duty Star Wars Minecraft GTA Nba games. Forza. Zelda.

You'd be really surprised there are a lot of stalkers and people that are trying to get all kinds of information about you. I have seen it firsthand with some people. Definitely insane. People have way too much time on their hands. Even with the secret tab. The only time I used to secret tabs for creepers and people that are really annoying. Sometimes for anonymous people. It just depends. I don't like using it on my followers. There's no reason to make them pay for coins to see my answers.

  Well just be careful with those kinds of people because sometimes they jump person-to-person.

  I don't know if you have seen the map but it's almost affected every area on the map now.

It really really sucks. Every hour there are thousands of more cases being created. It is spreading crazy. I heard that it's really mainly attacking low immune systems and older folks.

  ","
  I will tell you what my spirit animal is. And it took me a long time to figure out what my spirit animal was. I really wanted it to be a dolphin but for some reason something was telling me it wasn't a dolphin.
  
  My whole life growing up I was a tomboy like kinda like person and I was always made fun of for being like the guys so I was always treated like one of the guys which I was fine with that but I got made fun of a lot for it but as I grew up I haven't exactly grown out of that tomboy stage. I still have that tomboy like attitude and style but I definitely grew up. And that resembles to me the lifestyle of a swan. They aren't the most beautiful creatures when they first are born and growing up for most of their life but when they get to a certain part of their life stay blossom into a beautiful bird they get their wings and they learn to fly. My spirit animal I saw in my dreams when I do have my dreams and for some reason came up a lot. I never really was a fan of swans until the past couple years coming by. So that's why I feel like my life is mostly resembles a swan and my spirit animal is a swan.

   In your opinion, what age is best to become a mom? ?
  ","
  Any age when you are ready honestly. But I definitely would not have children too young though. Like too too young like... 10 11 12 or 13 years old....
  
  But a lot of people mess up and have children so young but they are able to take care of them then why not? If that's what they want. But I would not encourage young young pregnancy. Maybe about around the age of 18? That would be the youngest.
  
  The only thing about having children really young you are going to have to learn how to make sacrifices and learn different types of responsibilities. You are going to be different than other people around you. You may miss out on things but you will also have good experiences yourself. Having children changes you in good ways most of the time.
  
  But honestly anytime that you are mature enough to take care of another person is when I think you could start having kids.
  
  I just choose to wait because I want it to just be me and my husband for a while and he feels the same. Plus I just want it to be me and him around when we are taking care of the kids. Not having multiple people living with us or anything. No roommates.

   What is your favorite childhood memory? :) Story time? *sits criss cross apple sauce on the colorful puzzlepiece ask.fm carpet* :P
  ","
  Lol. You are silly.
  
  One really good childhood memory was playing outside and throwing water balloons at each other and drinking out of the water hose, when it wasn't a weird thing. Jumping on the trampoline and teaching each other how to wrestle and how to defend ourselves so if we ever got face-to-face with a bully or something we knew how to take care of ourselves or at least try. But these right here we're definitely really good memories. I remember racing each other on our bikes up and down the street that we lived on and it being the world every day to do that. I remember going out in the fields and making baseball fields and playing with all of my friends out there and sometimes going inside when it got too hot and plays video games with them. Even playing basketball sometimes.
  
  I remember finding white rocks and using them as chalk when we ran out of sidewalk chalk and we would write with the white rocks and draw stuff on the cement.
  
  So many good memories. Wrestling in the mud with my cousins and sisters and friends. Playing board games and swimming in the pool with my sisters. Playing role play games in the living room and some all the time. Also playing video games with them in the room too sometimes. Going spend the night at my grandparents house with them. All the birthday parties. Wonderful wonderful old school memories. ❤

  I mean of course if maybe the virus is out breaking in their area maybe get a few things? and just be careful make sure you wash your hands... take plenty of showers... and change your clothes maybe a bit more often then normal... don't get in people's faces... make sure you probably wear a mask definitely considering the viruses really deadly but I don't think of any to go to the store and buy all of their toilet paper? and sanitizer or soap and masks... maybe one or two masks? maybe some soap and sanitizer but save some for everyone else? Share? No? Lol? ? I don't really understand the toilet paper thing? Get the regular amount of toilet paper maybe? Or maybe an extra roll but don't buy all of it?

  Definitely a 10. I've been through a lot of stuff where I had to be patient to get to the good outcome. Especially cuz I was in a long-distance relationship for about five years. We're together and happy. Married and stronger than ever. Now I'm always distant from family and friends and always have to be patient to see them. Patience is definitely a virtue. Things will work out if you are patient. My greatest family and friends are all from all over the world. Some more than definitely I am always distant from someone that I love. I am used to it. Patience plays a very big role in my life. I had to learn it.

   Unpopular opinion: “People pay too much attention to other people’s business.” Your thoughts?
  ","
  I 100% agree with you. People are so focused on other people's business that they don't focus on themselves.
  
  A lot of the times people will get jealous of other people's successes. Why get upset at someone else's successes??
  
   Why not instead... they get out and succeed themselves instead of making fun of someone else's? And how they got there and how they like to do it. Because obviously they're doing just fine. They don't need you to tell them how and what to do. Constructive criticism is fine but rude and unnecessary and too much criticism as I said is unnecessary.

  ","
  I used to love playing with Tinker Toys and I have always wanted to own another set. My whole childhood I asked for a set of them over and over again but for some reason they were always so expensive. So I never really bothered with them. I didn't really want my parents to spend that much on them. And I mean they were really expensive. I guess because everybody was buying them. They weren't worth the money they were asking for. Honestly being the age I am now even I would still play with them if I got the opportunity. I love  Tinker toys. I like building. Building never gets old. Creating never gets old.

  "
38627,"
   How much do you eat in a typical day?
  ","
  I honestly don't try to eat too much in a day.
  
   Breakfast is definitely important. I try my best to drink a lot of water. Sometimes I like to make infused water. Infused water is basically adding fruits or vegetables to your water. Naturally flavors your water in a healthier way. Or get me some juice, but I like to add a little bit of water because sometimes the juices are a little strong. So I kind of water down my juice a little bit. I always add ice. Ice cold juice is the best. Not drinking soda for a while..  you get used to drinking water and then when you go to drink juice, juice gets to be really strong tasting. So to calm down the strong taste I water it down or add a lot of ice. Usually I do both. It works out for me. Drinking juices is really good for you because it goes through your body really quick. Helps your metabolism ALOT.
   
   Sometimes I like to get me a little almond milk or regular milk it just depends on what I'm in the mood for? I usually drink 1% or skim milk. I like to eat some yogurt in the morning. Sometimes I splurge and I get me some fresh fruit in the morning. But honestly in the morning getting sugars is really important. Sometimes I'll make me some eggs. Just depends.
   
    I try to go on a morning walk and walk my dogs. If I don't do that I usually clean around the house and I end up walking myself to death. And then I end up going to work anyway and walking around all day there. Then I come home and still work out. I usually always do stretches right when I wake up in the morning.
    
     Then for dinner. I do love to cook. I love Seafood. I tried to eat small portions. And I make sure that I eat dinner very soon not right before bed or anything. Absolutely love stir fry and I really like vegetables.  For lunch I try to eat usually just eat a snack. Maybe get me some crackers? Sometimes I like to make a smoothie? Or maybe eat some celery? Maybe a granola bar with that. But yeah. Light eating in the morning. Snack lunch. Light dinner. So yeah. Lol.

  ","
  How people don't realize how free they can be in this free country. And then also how unappreciative those people are about their freedom. It's embarrassing to a person that is not blind from any of it.
  
   And then people that don't have that type of freedom... that are restricted to what they can say, they can do, what they can believe and what they can be in other countries... see what I mean? Those people in the other countries understand that they are unappreciative here (in the USA) because a lot of things that we have in our country.... you can't do some other countries..
   
    I feel... that people should be more appreciative in our country. Appreciate their rights and abilities to be able to do certain things. Some people would die to be here in the USA. Where they can fully express themselves without having to hide and be  persecuted for things that they want to be.
    
    For me, being unappreciative of those types of things here in the USA seems embarrassing.

   Is it normal for a parent to want to know what their child is doing online and who they’re talking to, if the child is 20 years old or older?
  ","
  They are 20? 21? 22? Or even older? Well... It's nice to include your parents in who you are talking to... But when you are ready... but they don't exactly have to tell you everything every minute of the day everything they're doing who they're with where they're going because they're old enough to do what they want on their own. It's good to tell someone where you're going for your safety when you go out with someone new. Though understanding of the concern from an adult / parent but they are old enough to do what they want and on their own and what they do and make their own decisions

We washed the truck and cleaned it out. The bed and everything. We made some food, all of us. We made mini weenies, fried sweet potato slices and turkey bacon. Before that we went four wheeler riding and now we're about to go and meet a friend up in a few minutes. They made us some bracelets for a very good close friend that passed away.
  
  We've had a long and productive day for sure. Tomorrow I have to work all day but we will probably go four-wheeler riding again. Game.

   Are you aware that someone has it worse than you do?
  ","
  Absolutely. And there are people that have it even worse than they do. There are some people that don't have near to no clothes and live on the street and have to hide. They fight everyday just to be able to find something to eat. Or at least be able to eat once a week.
  
  I know this one guy that loved his job very much and he loved everyone he worked with. The upper upper management ended up all quiting eventually and moved on. They got new upper management and they were horrible and mean to him all the time. Apparently on the job he was working with them one day and one of the upper management people's ended up busting something and millions of pieces of glass got stuck in his skin. He had to go to the hospital and was recovering and they ended up firing him while he was still recovering days later. He did not have money for a lawyer. Because obviously he got fired.. no money.. he was struggling Had a Wife and Kids.... and then pain and suffering he was still trying to get better from the glass incident. He ended up having to move away he ended up losing his family because he wasn't able to come back from it all and his whole life literally went downhill from being fired for no reason from a  incident whether it was an accident or not that was caused by someone else. The world is literally horrible place. There are good things about the world and there are bad things about the world but one thing's for sure this world is getting worse day by day. We must be the ones to improve it and turn it around. Keep our environment around us better and take care of one another.

   What was the most silly award you got in school? Apparently one of my nephews is getting an award for being KIND ?
  ","
  Most tomboy person in school. ? Senior superlative award.
  
  The best. I was nominated I think and then voted in. And then I had some girl that was trying really really hard to win over me and was campaigning and everything and I didn't even campaign at all and I won. ? she was even trying do I tell them to not vote for me. Lol and they said the reason why they didn't vote her as the most tomboy because they said that she looked like a man! That there was a difference between acting a little guyish and like one of the guys and then looking like a man and I was like y'all are wrong for that! Mean. Lol. I guess that's what you get for being selfish. Her. Trying too hard and annoying people... But I appreciated the title. I grew up very much like tomboy. With the guys playing sports and in the mud, country kind of girl. I played many different types of sports. I enjoyed playing outside wrestling jumping on trampolines riding bikes and playing street ball. Water balloon fights. Playing video games. But I always was a girl I just enjoyed guy type activities.

  ","
  Absolutely.. Thanks.
  
  I was very heartbroken when this happened. I still am today. A lot of us still mourn the death of her... It was definitely one hundred percent tragic and unexpected. Especially since her mother was very sick.. and it kept coming back... she was sick really bad and Christina and her family were trying so hard to make her happy and do everything they could with the mama, because you never know when someone could go. Who would have ever thought she would have went first?! ??... my heart broke when my friend came and told me what was going on. At the time she was in the critical condition room. Clinging onto her life.... my heart truly broke when I heard that she did not make it.. I cried so hard.. For days.. Weeks.. I don't handled close one's dieing... there's a lot of family members deaths that I did not handle very well. I took very hard. But she was my idol. Someone I looked up to in life. Someone that made me happy. Made me feel whole.. My way out.. Her and her sweet loving personality and beautiful voice.
  
  Life is so unexpected. We must live everyday of it to the fullest. Because we are not promised tomorrow. With seeing the death of Christina Grimmie... this brought light to me. This brought that whole listen to me fully. And what I mean by that is that I truly respect and appreciate life. Because I know for sure she was not ready to go. She was not done here. But she had to go. She was an angel. The Lord needed her. She truly was a angel walking on Earth...
  
  We will always remember you Christina. ❤ You were and still are a bright light in people's lives and hearts. Thank you. ???

   Are you good at cooking? Did somebody teach you how to cook or did you learn by yourself? Do you cook only for yourself or for your family members too? ?
  ","
  I find myself and I feel that others find me good at cooking but idk fully. Never know. Especially because people have their own preference and opinions. Some may like my food and some may not you know what I mean but considering most of the time when I cook people enjoy the tasting of my food. I love to get compliments on my food and I love to see smiles on I cooked food and serve it to people. I absolutely love to cook. I love making people happy with my food making.
  
  I learned how to cook from many different family members. In our culture that is how I grew up through. That is always something that we learn to in the end. We watched the grown ups cook. Helped. And of course watched the different techniques and how they did it. It's all very traditional. A kind of just comes natural to us as long as we did all of that. Just watch and learn. Take notes occasionally. Especially right down the recipes always and then eventually we start to learn to my heart. And then we learn the techniques and how they did it exactly. And it starts to taste like they did it. Cooking definitely runs in my blood. I'm Cajun French/Creole so we definitely cook some good soul food. Good lovely food. Food of all kinds of flavors and textures. Down here in the South we definitely keep it real with food.
  
  I love to cook. ??❤?
  
  Goodnight now y'all.

  ","
  ⚫ How long have I been here? ⚫
  
  I've actually been on this site for a really long time I actually don't even remember because I started a really long time ago and wasn't active very much throughout the years and then about two years ago I started to really get active on this app.. But I guess for about seven, eight or nine years maybe? I'm actually not very sure... sorry I'm not being able to answer this question very well!
  
  ⚫ What do I like most? ⚫
  
  I love the people. I enjoy talking to them and helping them if they need me. I really enjoy their company. That is probably my most favorite thing about the app. You get to meet people from all over the world. You get to hear about their culture and you get to experience the way that they talk and stuff like that. A lot of people are scared to explore the world and talk to different people. I do not judge people or disrespect anyone and their culture and their traditions. I let everyone do them. I accept them. I think it's all neat. I enjoy exploring and experiencing new. Everyone is different and I want to meet them all. ❤
  
  ⚫What should be changed?⚫  There are a few harassers on this app that make multiple accounts that I think needs to be taken care of. And they harass different people on here and I don't think that's right. I don't pay them no mind. But I just think that it needs to be evaluated a little bit more or something.
  
  ⚫How do I respond to trolls?⚫ Again I don't pay them no mind. I'm here to help people and talk to people. That's it. That's always what I've been here for him. And I enjoyed very much.
  
  But like I said just ignore people and they will leave you alone and if they don't then just report it and keep ignoring them.
  
  Thank you so much. This site had done so much for me and I hope that I helped a lot of people out. I hope that I've provided friendship for a lot of people and I just want to keep going with it. But yeah. You're welcome. Thanks for asking the questions that you did.

   What's a question you get/got asked all the time?

  There are so many repeats that I get. I get people that ask me a lot what's my favorite song.
  
  A lot of times I do send repeat questions on accident like one after another because I'm not sure if I sent that person the question or not and... but I think that is totally understandable. It's a mistake. I don't mean to do that. I think because some people do it to me too but like some people will send me like hello like 5 times in a row and expect me to immediately answer the question and I'm not on 24/7? I don't know if they're just new and they don't understand how it works or not but yeah. I get that a lot.
  
  I get a lot of people asking me about the Paranormal stuff which I don't mind.
  
  There are a lot of other repeat questions that I get. A lot of the time they are generic questions from Ask.fm and I'll probably get the same one every week. I try to answer them every week but it's just like sometimes it just gets repetitive. I try really hard to send different types of questions out too and try not to send the same one. I always try to keep it different and original. So that my answering folks don't get bored with me.

I don't know if you exactly count it as ""street"" baseball but we did go out in this field and we used to get in the dumpsters and find boxes and make bases out of them and get a whole team together and play baseball together. All the kids that lived in the community. I really miss those days. One time I was sleeping in my room and literally I had one of them come wake me up at tell me... ""Come on! Wake up! We're going play some baseball!"" LOL I guess my mom thought it would be funny to let them and then come and wake me up to go play. Those were the good days. Videos I played baseball / softball for about six or seven years if you count the street/field baseball. Play it on a team? I played about four years. I played right fielder catcher and a little bitty bit of pitcher.

   What's the fire button for? (This wasn't around when I first used askfm so... Is it a currency system???) What do you do with it? Again, thanks.
  ","
  The fire button is used to reward people on the app. Fire are points. Every single country has a leaderboard. Everybody has a limit on their fire. Everybody has a wallet with coins / fire and so use your fire wisely. Honestly alot of people make a big deal out of fire but honestly I don't. If I'm given fire I appreciate it from anyone and everyone. I mainly on this app for communicating with people and helping people. I like to reward a lot of people on their answers.
  
  Do not beg for fire because you can get reported and banned. A lot of people try to dig for fire. This is considered spam and can get you off the app.
  
  But that's what fire is for. Fire is points and fire is reward. You reward People based off of how well the answer the question that you ask them. Or how well someone else ask them the question and you like to answer and you can reward them.

  All containers have expiration dates on it. Even though people still use it after the expiration date because it doesn't really go bad even after. But sour cream after a few weeks after the expiration date I would probably not eat it just for your safety.

  The book called, ""Speak Now.""
  
  They picked for us to read in the fourth grade. I honestly do not know why they picked that. It was very graphic. It affected me in a good way and a bad way but honestly I wish they would have had us read it maybe an eighth grade or something. The book was extremely graphic and I actually wish I didn't read it. It triggered a lot of my anxiety but it's all good. It affected me in a good way because it taught me to look out. Be cautious and aware. Do I recommend it? Yes but for people that are at least over the age of 18. It's not because it has like sex or anything in it no. It's just because it's kind of traumatizing in a way. Definitely an embarrassing book to be reading and speaking test on around a bunch of other younger kids in class. They actually didn't do any tests or anything they just made us read it and that was it I'm happy that that's all they made us do.

   You can’t change the past but today starts anew,
The only difference can be the change in you.
So start the day fresh and learn from the past,
Not repeating the same mistakes, don’t let them last.
Make this day one of the best! :)

  Yeah. That's one thing I love about spring. When you go into Lowe's and you go into the gardening area. It's absolutely beautiful. Filled with blooming plants, trees and bushes.... Some cacti. Bamboo.. roses, wildflowers all kinds of things. We are thinking about getting the flower bed back together and maybe getting a few trees and then maybe getting a few rose bushes on the sides of the house. But I'm not sure yet. In the flower bed we will probably get some wildflowers or something. Maybe some butterfly attracting type flowers. They have those. We have a butterfly bush in the front of the house and it attracts a ton of butterflies and moths. But like I said I'm not sure yet about the rose bushes on the side of the houses because sometimes we get wasp all up in our bushes and I want to be able to go up to them and clip roses off of them so... I'm not sure yet. Maybe. But if we get some... I am thinking I want to get three or four on one side of the house... and the other side of the house I may not put any. Then in the backyard I'm thinking about getting a peach tree and two apple trees and then in the front yard I'm thinking about getting a pecan tree or two.
  
  There are also these little white trees that we were thinking about getting too. We are thinking about getting two or three of them. When they bloom in the spring they are absolutely beautiful. Though they make a mess I am fine with that. But today has been very productive. I didn't get any plans today but I might in the future. I'm not sure if we will do it this year but maybe next year but we are definitely going to get the flower bed together.

   They say 2 trust your instincts but what if you have not one but 5 mental illnesses would you still trust your instincts?
  ","
  Everybody has a, gut feeling. And if something doesn't feel right, don't go with it. Even if you have a mental illness or two or three or four or five or 20.
  
  I know people that are autistic and have tons of other issues and sometimes they still have a gut feeling thinking that something's not safe and they don't go with it and a lot of the times it turns out right, and good results. ?? Same with normal people. Sometimes we don't go with things and sometimes it works out and sometimes we could have just went with it and nothing would have went wrong. Gut feeling. Bad vibes. trust your instincts. Always. Cuz after all at least you tried to be safe and do the right thing right?

  It says I got a 7 out of 10 but I accidentally didn't read the rest of the questions on how many kids you had and pick 2 even though I knew you were pregnant with another but I meant like to as in the one you had in the the one your about to have. I guess that's what I get for not reading all the answers! Haha. So basically I got 8 out of 10 but counted for only 7 outta 10. Aye! That is good enough for me!

   ??‍♀️? When you go to the hair dresser, do you enjoy the small talk they try to keep going or do you find it rather annoying? ??‍♂️

  My hairdresser is family and I've been going to her for like 15 years so when I go it's pretty much like visiting family. She's like cousin of cousin of cousin type family. I see her around Mardi Gras time too. So when I go I don't mind having long conversations with them. My hair shop is almost like a club. So when you go in there everybody's there. I always try to to bring flowers to when I go. She absolutely loves that. But I try to catch up with them all. They love seeing Jason too. They love it when men come in there. Because it's such a girly environment so it kind of helps  balance the environment. Plus we feel safe when we have men there because we have guys come into sometimes to get their haircut. But that's different for me I guess. If I was at a random hairdresser and they were just talking and talking gossip and you didn't even know what they were talking about I guess that could be a little annoying at times. That's understandable. I don't mind talking while they do my hair. Considering it takes a good minute to do my hair.

   4am thoughts? ..
  ","
  Well it's almost 1:30 a.m. but my thoughts at the moment are, I miss my mom. Louisiana. But there's always something that we miss. But that's what I miss. And then when I'm in Louisiana, I miss Mississippi. And when I'm away from my husband, I miss him. And when I'm away from my mom again, I miss her. As I've gotten older I have learned that we're always going to miss someone. We're always going to be a distant from someone. Whether it be a really good friend, a loved one or even my husband. Even my dog. I find that the hardest thing for me. Is to know no matter what I do, I will never be able to have everyone I love together. But that's okay. That's what keeps me fighting. I appreciate the obstacles. Sometimes I just wish for a clear road. But that's not how life works. Unfortunately. But as I said before it's all good. Much love to you all. I will be going to sleep shortly.

  ","
  The worst part is just dealing with certain people that want to make your life miserable. This is everyday but the best part was getting to go to South Louisiana and spending time with my family and friends and celebrating the wonderful holiday Mardi Gras down here. We take this holiday very serious because it is a part of my culture and where I am from. I have grown up through all of this. I love spending time with family and friends. My most favorite part would have to be the parade and going to the Myrtles Plantation for the first time in my life. Another good time was going out to eat with my mom and family. And just sitting in the living room and just getting to talk to everybody and enjoying ourselves. Me and my sisters sat in the living room and sang together. I also very much enjoyed this. Just like old times. My mom just kind of sat there and soaked it in. I could tell that she really loved hearing all of us sing together again. I think she missed the racket. I love my family I love my sisters and I love my mom. Seeing my husband spend time with all of them was very nice too. He enjoyed himself in south Louisiana to. My dog G had a blast too.

   What is the most paranormal thing you have witnessed?
  ","
  The most?? Idk the most I've ever.. considering I have wwitnessed alooot alot...  but I will share this. While visiting the Myrtles Plantation located out in the middle of nowhere in St Francisville Louisiana. We walked around a little bit got to go inside of the gift shop and visit people. We got to look at the property real well. We went on our nightly to worm and after we were allowed to walk around the property. We went and walked out on this bridge that they have there and halfway through walking on the bridge one of the people that I was with randomly started having a breakdown. The thing that is very ironic is basically where she started to freak out, the spot on the bridge, this is where a young man passed away from a very sad death. I believe that she was feeling his sorrow before he died. She was feeling what he felt before he died. Sometimes on these paranormal investigations this will happen. You will feel what the spirit fell when it was dying. Or what it was feeling when it was alive. Which is usually something really angry or sad or traumatizing. In which I think this person was feeling he felt before he passed. The reason why I say this is because she said she did not understand why she started crying and panicking. She just said she started feeling really really bad and sad and she doesn't know why. I explained to her this and she didn't was like maybe you're right. But we will never know. Considering this is just me telling you what happened to us. I was there with her and two other people. They witnessed it also. Also while we were there another person sat down and was waiting for us and they got up, and started to run away because they said that they got touched. This is a lot of paranormal activity that happened at once. There's a lot of other stuff that happened but these were the two major things.

   Dutch apple pie fresh out the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream I could taste it right now. But I enjoy seafood. I’m still looking for a great spot to find great seafood. Can you recommend any? It doesn’t matter the location
  ","
  We really like going to the Chinese buffet around here. We like their wong tongs and their sushi. The salmon there is really good too. They bake their salmon. They have pretty good simple Seafood.
  
  Down in south Louisiana where I am from there is a really good China Buffet that they have a night where you can have all you can eat seafood. But it's really expensive. For 5 people it was almost $100 dollars. You can have crab shrimp crawfish fish oysters. They have way more than this they also have tons of vegetables different types of sesame chicken rice noodles different types of potato and fried foods. They also have a dessert aisle and a salad tray aisle and Sushi and cold shrimp.
  
  And then they have a place called Golden Corral but they don't have too much Seafood there. But their food is good. I'm sure that they have some choices.
  
  They have a place called Mike Anderson's and they have really good seafood platters there. I definitely recommend that place.
  
  I love going to Oishi. They have the best Sushi and Hibachi place ever.
  
  There's a place called Bayou bronze and they have very good dishes there including seafood dishes. That is what you see in the picture below is a dish from bayou bronze. Eating at Hooters is good.
  
  Sometimes I even like to get the shrimp from Popeyes.
  
  I love to get some boiled crawfish and sometimes they add corn sausage room sometimes if you ask for crabs they will throw that in two different types of vegetables Onions mushrooms and way way more.
  
  There's a place over there where I used to live and it's called the jambalaya shop. They sell boiled crawfish and stuff I think and of course they sell pastalaya jambalaya and other types of things too. I'm sure gumbo. Potato salad. Baked beans. And way more.
  
  There is another place in BR called The Voodoo Cafe. Very delicious food. I tried their red beans and rice and it was golden!
  
  There are so many other places. This is just a few.

  Oh my bad. Idky I said car.
  
  I've heard a lot of stories about people being evil and murdering animals. I'm so sorry for that and what happened. It is very unfortunate. I have one friend that their neighbor kept trying to feed their dog glass and shoot them. That is absolutely terrible. The only time you should ever try to end anything or anyone's life as if your life is being threatened. And honestly you could talk people out of it but if you have to do what you have to do then so be it but there is no reason to kill an innocent animal. Especially if it is a family member to someone.

  ","
  Idk about guiding all. They can guide but they also don't have to.
  
  I can tell you more about Capricorn's if you would like.
  
  Us Capricorns, we are workaholics, which is pretty much the best kind of addiction I guess you could say? But the shadow side of their ability to climb the ladder to success is a deeply embeddedfear offailure. That is what we fear most. Thisfearis also what sets their slow-and-steady pace in everything they do.
  
  Generally speaking,Capricorns can be veryloyalto their loved ones. Trust is very important toCapricorns, because they can tend towards pessimism, having a partner they can depend on is of immense value to them. They appreciate a steady, responsible partner.
  
  Are we clingy?
  
  Us Capricorn's, we are traditionalist, which means that we are not much of a fan of PDA or anything that could end up being embarrassing for our other. Even if our partner's actingclingy, sometimes we try our best to not embarrass them. But if they want a kiss or a hug or to hold our hands we will let them. But we only do it out of respect. Though at the same time as Capricorns do you like our attention from our partners. But we try our best not to be too clingy or embarrassing in public. But like I said more or less out of respect for our partner.
  
  That is some more on them.

  Usually you only brush the front of your teeth with that. It is a all natural way of whitening your teeth.

  Eh.. Not super often. Sometimes I do the charcoal brushing but very very rare. Maybe twice a yeat. Considering it's really messy. You can look it up online. Make sure if you go to buy it you buy the cheap one because it's not supposed to be really expensive. I just make sure that I brush my teeth twice a day and floss alot and visit my local dentist for yearly cleaning. Sometimes I go twice a year. That's usually what they recommend. Getting your teeth cleaned isn't that much and it's good so you can avoid getting cavities. Because when you go to clean your teeth sometimes you can't get to certain areas of your mouth and teeth.

  Everyone has a beautiful smile whether you have a gap in between your teeth or not or if one or two of your teeth are sideways. Everybody has their own smile.
  
  You can also get with a few clients and try to find out if maybe you can lower the cost of your braces. You can get braces as cheap as $1,000-2,000. You just have to look around and talk to the right people. They will bill you. You will just have to pay it over time. Just make sure that they know that you might not be able to pay it all the time. But definitely stick to paying them. Considering they're trying to help you out.
  
  You would be surprised. 1 grand is not that much anymore. And if you can get braces for just that much. I think that that would be good. But she still can't afford it don't be discouraged about it. There are a lot of things that were not able to afford nowadays. Just be you and be confident in who you are. You were made that way for a reason.

  Capricorns are strong. We're supposed to be high with confidence. Once you linger away from that.. you need to find your way back. Try to reconnect with some of your hobbies. Discover talents. Maybe reconnect with some old friends and family. Try to get out with nature and do things outside more often. Socialize.
  
  Capricorn's have to stay productive or they get really really depressed and upset. We are always trying to express ourselves. Once we're not able to do it we almost feel like we are stuck and lost.

  The only reason why I gave you so many is because I decided to give you two days worth because you said that you wanted questions.
  
  I say don't ask for questions and then when you get them so you don't want anymore.
  
  I am not mad just confused on you asking and then taking it back?? But it's okay.

  ","
  I'm extremely patriotic so my favorite colors are red white and blue together and I wear those a lot. Plus my room is decorated very much in those colors too. When I wear those colors I feel whole. I feel really good. I love my country so that's why those are my favorite colors. But my whole life I've always favored the color red. I also really like the color white growing up too. My husband loves the color blue so I said why not like all three colors? Plus I live in this wonderful country. So red white and blue are my favorite colors. Obviously if they go quite well together too.

   Why are there so many people who are lonely? Why is it so hard for people to make real connections when almost everyone wants to make real connections?
  ","
  People are always around people and are being carried by another individual. People need to try to be more independent. Live on their own. You should be able to take care of yourself first and then if you want to take care of someone else. Have confidence in yourself that you can take care of yourself. A lot of people are afraid that they're not able to do it. When they are 100% capable. We are human beings and we're capable of anything. Everyone's scared of being by themselves. I've been by myself and can take care of myself I don't mind it though I really enjoy having my husband. Everyone will meet that one special person you just have to give it time. If you hurry it up then you're just going to be miserable in the end. Patience is a virtue for sure. I have learned that overtime.

That is an example of a toxic person and usually you don't even need them in your life. There's going to keep sucking the life out of you. Once you go your way you will realize that you're happier.
  "
39157,"
   Do you judge people on those things, or draw any conclusions about people based on that stuff?
  ","
  Maybe I need to explain further when I mean. When I say attitude I'm talking about someone that just straight-up starts being an ashole and being mean to people and is just talking all kinds of crazy stuff and is just physically pushing people around and cussing and just has an overall bad vibe. I'm actually just try to stay away from people like that because usually bad things happen. I don't try to judge people I just tried to stay safe there's a difference. Why stay and then something end up happening when I could have just trusted my instincts and walk away. That's what I mean by if I meet someone and this is what I see first. I don't exactly try to judge people when I first meet them but if someone's trying to beat the crap out of someone I'm going to get away.
  
  And then smell of a person. I don't judge them based off of that. That's just the first thing that I notice when I meet someone. Whether it be a good smell or a bad smell.

  ","
  Yeah? Well.. I'm sorry that happened to you. I am.
  
  By the way.
  
  This is a side note.
  
  ______
  
  You do not have to explain anything to anyone on here. I saw on your page somebody asking you what your disability is. I don't answer those kinds of questions. Is none of their business. Don't let these people run you on here. But also don't be getting to mean with people. Not saying you did. It's just sometimes they will try to rile you up and get you mad so they can report you and get you banned. Also if they ask you too much of inappropriate questions be careful with the curse words and stuff that they put in the questions because people can report those too and get your account banned same with answers. I saw that you didn't tell them about your personal disability business and that but still I thought that I would stick up for you. I don't appreciate people asking people that kind of stuff. It doesn't matter what are disabilities are. Because honestly they're asking you so they can make fun of you. Why else would they be asking you what your disabilities are right? But like I said it doesn't matter what are disabilities are. What matters is that we it make through those things. That made my blood boil. I absolutely cannot stand people that are like that. They got their own problems asking other people with their are.
  "
39201,"
   I think I have feelings for one of my guy friends but he won't talk to me, I want to tell him how I feel
  ","
  It sounds like now's not a good time though. Just keep giving it time. Do you think maybe the reason why he won't talk to you because he thinks that you like him? Have you been giving him signs?
  "
39202,"
   Sometimes I wonder if I will find a guy in my life. Someone who likes me for who I am.
  ","
  It's not easy to find someone that one hundred percent gets you for you.
  
  I always tell people don't rush into a relationship and if you do find someone don't hurry the beginning of the relationship up. The beginning of true relationships are absolutely the greatest. Because once he gets in like a year or two you almost want to go back to the beginning and do it all over again because it was so wonderful though being a year or two and is wonderful to just the meeting part is just the greatest. It's y'alls own story.
  
  The way me and Jason met almost sounds like it's not real.
  
  But I always tell people just look very carefully. Because you don't want to get stuck in something especially an abusive relationship. Especially a very controlling and possessive relationship. Some people can become stalkers and even try to kill you and you don't want that... not trying to get graphic with this but life is this serious. Life is too short. Life is precious. We must be careful with who we run into. And who we trust fully. But give it time. You don't seem like you're too bad. Especially the way that we've been talking back and forth.
  
  The biggest things in a relationship is communication and loyalty and trust and working together.
  
  To find someone you have to have confidence in yourself and confidence that you can take care of them. Respect for one another.
  
  If you don't have confidence in yourself then it's really hard to find somebody. Find what makes you truly happy and go with it. I always say try to find some hobbies. Something you're really good at. Try to impress people.
  "
39203,"
   I will try it out and let you know how it goes
  ","
  It takes a little time to get meditation so don't get frustrated just off of one video and one session. Try it for the next week. Try a different times maybe or look at many different videos.
  
  You might actually fall in love with meditation. Some people will meditate as long as four hours even a whole day. I'm not saying do it that long no, but to relax yourself before you read a book. And only focus on the story and what it could be about.

  For some odd reason I don't really like bananas by themselves the texture is weird.

   How do you get rid of stress and negative energy???

#RainyDay
  ","
  Sometimes we have to get rid of certain people or things to clear the negativity in the air around you. It is important to have the environment in which you live in everyday positive. So sometimes you have to shapen your life and what you do everyday in it. Who you hang out with because some people can be controlling and  toxic. Some people make themselves hang out with certain people to feel like they're accepted. But at the end of the day they feel terrible and upset and miserable. And even more or less be worried about the next day and what could happen. Life should be spontaneous and you should live it unknowingly. But trust that the things that are happening are meant to be. I always say be social and productive and it always makes me happy. Makes a happy and positive life. I also say always connect with nature no matter what. Even if it means go and sit out there on a blanket on your phone. You still are outside.

   Do you have a story that you’d like to share?
  ","
  To hear more of this story, I have mentioned it underneath this answer / question if you want to check on my page. It will tell you more about this place and me.
  
  The Myrtles Plantation in south Louisiana and my experience and what I know from being there.
  
  This place is known to have 12 to 13 spirits inhabiting the place. These girls are said to walk the grounds. There are many different terrible and sad stories that have happened with the death of these people. This place has been around for almost two hundred years. It has been around during the Civil War times. There are said to the Indian burial grounds underneath this place also. Also aside from the 13 spirits that walk the grounds there are also unmarked Graves as I said the Indian burial ground. Plus other civil war people's buried around and I'm sure.
  
  The plantation that is today known as Myrtles was once known by a different name. Some people may have heard it called Whiskey Dave, but the original name of the plantation was Laurel Grove. This antebellum plantation is located in St. Francisville, Louisiana. St. Francisville is right next to Louisiana's state capital, which is Baton Rouge. The plantation was built in 1796 by a General named David Bradford.Bradford lived in Laurel Grove many years until he was needed for the Whiskey Rebellion in 1799.
  
  This is another picture from the Myrtles Plantation that I'm going to be sharing below. This I took myself at night.

   What's the best news you've ever received?
  ","
  While in Louisiana...
  
  One afternoon, we were all sitting in the living room at my Mama's house and I was surrounded by family and we were talking about bucket list type things. And one of mine was to go to the Myrtles Plantation in south Louisiana.
  
  We were just sitting there talking about that and they were surprised to know that I have never been before. So behind my back, in good way, they were online purchasing tickets to surprise me to go with all of them. All the sudden they said well we're going to go later on and I said what?! What?! Your kidding me? Right? And they're like no would you like to go later? And I said is that question?! What?! YES! OF COURSE! I was absolutely surprised and excited as ever to go and visit the place that I have always wanted to go to.
  
  For the ones that don't know what the Myrtles Plantation is it is one of the most haunted places in the United States of America. Top 10 most haunted. In Louisiana is the top number one most haunted place in Louisiana. Me, I love and have been researching the Paranormal for a looong time and love going to different types of haunted locatione to learn about the history and what happened there. I most definitely was excited to go to this location. It is always been my dream. The experience was amazing. And I would love to go back again during the day and stay the night. We went during the night. That was the best news that I had gotten. I think I got some more but this definitely was some of the best news I have gotten in the past week. I thank my mama and my nanny for putting this together for me and taking all of us. I had a blast and enjoyed it a lot!
  
  This is a picture from the place that I went to. This is one of many.

  I'm still part of the VIP program but it just glitches like crazy and they want like 10,000 for the VIP crown and then I will click it and get it for 10000 and it doesn't give me the crown? so I kinda gave up on getting it because I would have to get it like two or three or four different times just for it to show up and I think that that's a waste of time.

A minnie giant and I hope that he can get comfortable in a little room like that. Haha.
  
  Anyway. You have a good night!
  "
39308,"
   What makes it super?
  ","
  Traveling long distances in a car without going insane. Basically going on a mini tour.
  
  The other thing that makes it super is because literally one of my dogs goes everywhere with me, but the type of trip we're going on is on a train and I don't think that I'm going to be able to take him. So the reason why I say super is because this will be the first time that we go on a trip and be away from my dog for a long period time. He has severe separation anxiety so I'm very scared about leaving him with someone. But the person I am leaving them with he absolutely adores so he should be okay. Hopefully.
  
  But also what it makes it super because it's something that me and my husband have always wanted to do together. Is travel the United States. All the way up to Alaska through Canada all the way down to the bottom. And maybe even Mexico. Considering me and him we're in a long distance relationship it kind of makes it really special for us. I don't know why but it has some sort of connection with all the distance stuff. Traveling. So that's why I say super trip. Me and him just love cruising in a car together. It just makes a really exciting Adventure type feeling for us. Knowing that we're going into a direction without knowing what could happen next but we're doing it out of love and wanting to do it together. Discovering together. Experiencing it together. ?
  "
39309,"
   What do you enjoy more giving or receiving? Are you a selfless or selfish person? Do you put others needs above your own?
  ","
  I honestly love cooking for people and seeing their faces and reactions and smiles after trying my food. Very rarely will I get someone that doesn't like my food. Usually the only time I get someone that doesn't like my food is because they get jealous or something. This is not always the case. But I have gotten a few people like this. But there's no reason to get jealous. Practice makes perfect. Anyone can do it. I perfect my food and if it's not done right then I don't serve to people. Every now and then I might get someone saying that it's a bit spicy but that's just how I am. I love spicy food. But I don't always try to make it really really hot. I try my best to make it mild tasting or just regular tasting. But I always warn people before they eat my food that it could possibly be a bit spicy. I don't mean to. This is just how I have always known to prepare food. But I definitely tried to be more of a person that cares for other people's needs first. But at the same time I still take care of myself too. I guess you could say I'm a bit selfless sometimes. I definitely do not take myself as a selfish person. I can't stand selfishness. I try my very best to not be.

  Sometimes you just need to erase everything about them. Literally block everything about them get rid of all pictures. Connect with your hobbies and skills and talents. Connect was good friends and family. Get out and do stuff. Every day get out and do something. Whether it means go somewhere visit a friend or family member or go out to a restaurant and get you something to eat. Go bowling or ice skating or gaming. Get into vaping. Go fishing or hunting. Discover some Hobbies. Get into CB radios. Fix a car.  Do some wood burning or painting. Build something. Go play out in the mud or ride a 4-wheeler. Something!

  I'm absolutely extremely passionate about singing. I started getting into singing as early as the age of six or seven years old. Me and my sister were dancing in the room and I was dancing on a chair singing Avril Lavigne with her and that's the day that I really decided that I wanted to try to really work on my voice. She gave me a little bit of advice and every day since then I'm always practice and saying every day. I don't exactly know where it'll bring me but all I know is I enjoy entertaining and making people smile with the sound of my voice.
  
  This is something that I'm very passionate about. I love to sing. When I am down, I sing it always cheers me up. Of course other things do too but this simple thing always turns my day around. Because it is something I enjoy to do.
  
  I have sang for many different places and people. Many different events. I have sang for schools, churches, football games, karaoke, night bars, at funerals and way way more.
  
  I was going to do some sort of American Idol type thing but I decided not to. There's so much mone,  traveling and time and so many sacrifices you have to make and in the end you could not succeed. It's a really big thing to take. Risk. But yeah I thought I would like to share that. That is why my username is ice frozen vocals. You could literally be the best and not succeed. I have watched someone be the best and her life and right in front of her. Christina Grimmie. She's a very big inspiration in my life. Also Avril Lavigne. The band Paramore. Evanescence. Skillet. All these bands have played a big big part of my life. Flyleaf. PVRIS. Ryan Upchurch. Gym Class Heroes. T-pain. Miley Cyrus for a good part of my life back in the day and Justin Bieber. I was a day one on both until they kinda started to go downhill... It's whatever. Fam can change some people living in it for so long. Can't help it. Britney Spears & Hilary Duff. All these names have played a big part of my life. The awesome Cheetah Girls! All good times!

  Not even of things that weren't there. I was very punky scene looking.. If ya know what that is. I was the person that usually just got along with anyone and everyone. But not the mean people. We had these few groups of people that were just straight up mean and annoying and racist. And they just thought everyone was racist. When honestly I wasn't and they weren't. Some people just think everyone's out to get them. It was like dang if you do dang if you don't type of people. I like... If I didn't talk to them then I was weird and anti-social and they wanted to talk to me and then the minute they did talk to me then I talk too much? Yeah I never understood them. I think they were just jealous. Maybe it was b/c the way I looked? Who knows? ? lol my appearance was a little intimidating people told me but I never understood why. My other nickname was the crazybigbootywhitegirl. ? Idky my butt wasn't/isn't that dang big. I think they were just messing with me. Some. Or maybe I am wrong? Idk. I think the crazy part because I never really let anyone pick on me or at least I tried. So I guess that's why they would call me crazy? Cause alot of people wouldn't say nothing back.

  Pancakes are okay.

   What personality trait do you admire in other people?
  ","
  I really admire random acts of kindness. Loyalty is a very big thing for me. Trust. Having people's backs. When I tell you to not say something about something I trust that you aren't going to say anything unless of course it jeopardizes my life or yours. That is different. But sometimes people like to hear things from you and then go tell the world. If I tell you something it's in between me and you only. Vice versa. If you tell me something it's going to stay with me unless of course it jeopardizes me or your life. In that way I am caring for you.
  
  I enjoy confidence in a person. Respect for themselves and respecting others. Knowing when to speak and knowing when to not. Common sense.

  Omgosh! And the quiz I had made was hilarious too!
  
  Like.. UGH. I went and put a review up saying...
  
  Like... If you guys need us to download the app first before making the quiz then you need to make it to where that sequence of events happens 1st. Like... It say... DOWNLOAD 1ST THEN START YOUR QUIZ HERE or something?? If you allow people to make a quiz before downloading it and it not work.... then we spend all the time making a quiz and then it not work?! What's the point! Because I made a quiz for about an hour and 15 min or longer and I submitted it and then all the sudden the page decided to not work? Not load? Have an error? Why didn't it at least save it or something? Draft? In a tab? Idk! Then when I went back on the tabs and everything? Nothing. Gone.
  
  I was really angry and was not going back and restarting. Plus, I wasn't going to remember half of my answers that I originally had. I probably wasn't going to even remember all 10 questions. But the quiz was hilarious. Because some of the questions we're well thought-out and so are their answers. Some of the questions had five to six to seven answers just to make it interesting.
  
  But I figured it out.. AFTER THE FACT. Lol.... I think I was supposed to download the app first, but like! UGH why did it give me the option to go ahead and make a quiz first?! that's my thing?! If they know it's not gonna for some?! Or worse everyone? Why have that error?! Why not fix it?! It's clear that it's there! Dangit. Lol. Cuz I thought that maybe I can make the quiz and then it go ahead and register me and then start like a regular app would right? Nooooo. Ohhhh noooo. THAT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL. Lol I'm not really that mad. More laughing at how stupid... Ughh. More aggravated with the fact that I took almost an hour doing it. Also because I'm an admin/page owner/creator too and I just don't know how people can miss such simple things like that and not fix them? Ya know what I mean? Like come on man! Whatever. DX FUK.

   On a scale of 1 to 5, how mean or unkind can you be?

  1 being not alot or often
  
  Mean... I can be a little firm about things and people take that as being mean but it's not. The truth hurts. But I am not mean under any circumstance. Randomly just decide to be mean to someone. So 0 to 1. And the reason why I said one is because I'm sure that we all have our moments. Where we get angry or mad or frustrated and sometimes we may seem a little main at those moments.
  
  Unkind??
  
   I don't ever try to be unkind so that's a zero. 1 outta 5 it's a 0. ? lol none.

39433,"
   Yaa it takes time to heal I just wanted to try it once
  ","
  Yeah. As long as you listen to their directions on how to take care of it you should be fine. Regular earrings are fine. But usually when you get your ears pierced at first usually only start with really small stubs in your ears. It helps for cleaning and irritation less. Plus you have to change them and clean your ears and I don't think you want to keep changing out earrings that are hanging and stuff like that. Plus hanging earrings my irritate your ear at first. Plus it's good to learn with the regular little stubs first. Unless you are already familiar with putting in and removing earrings.
  "
39434,"
   Thank you Di. How are the earrings ??
  ","
  I thought they were all really cute. You can get your ears pierced in real life you know this? Unless they don't do this there. They don't hurt that bad. But I wouldn't know. I've never gotten my ears pierced before although I have tattoos and they don't hurt. I'm sure they wouldn't hurt that bad if you got some. But the only thing is you got to make sure you take care of them very well. Because the healing process takes a little bit.

That's what dating sites are for?? because a lot of these people are married and are uninterested. Some of them are even single and they're just on the site to enjoy the site! They're not looking for anyone because it's not a dating site. ?? Dang.

   I didn’t know there was a limit to liking answers at a time

  Crazy enough... There is and its really annoying. Because sometimes I just like to spam y'alls page's with likes! ???? 20 to 30 to 40 and even more sometimes! And then... I think maybe it's 500? Is the limit??? I'm actually not sure... 750? Iiiiidk.. Honestly.... but it makes me stop after a certain amount and it doesn't let me like stuff until like 6?  hours to 12?! hours later and I'm like oh my gosh! Wtheck?! that's too long!! And then people get mad that I'm not liking their answers but I can't!.. ? Ya know? I try my best.
  
  Same with the coins. There is a limit that I can't go pass with giving them out and rewarding. I think it's freeeakin.. 2,000??? I wish I could reward everybody lots of coins! but I can't. There is a limit everyday. And people are constantly always asking me for going. Why are you asking? I don't ask people for coins either. I earned the things that I get. And I appreciate everything. You guys give me the opportunity. Thank you! And then people are... YOU/I buy coins? And I'm like no... I don't? I don't buy coins. I don't have money for that. I don't think they realize how much money you would have to invest every day and then every week... I have earned everything that has been given to me on here and I do the VIP program and they reward me for being active and doing their tasks. I do not buy any type of coins on here. Never have. Never will. No reason. A complete and utter waste of money. Why not just earn them, right?
  
  But as I said before. I tried to get to everyone and I also try to like as much as I can. I would be here all day liking every single question. I try my best and I appreciate all of your answers and questions! Thank you guys. Love you all!

   Lately I have been cutting back on time spent on social media, and it feels good.  Have you ever taken a break from social media or cut back on time spent?  If so, how was it for you?
  ","
  You know... I think it's really ironic that I just talked about this in an answer and I didn't see this question until just now right after I answered the question the way that I did. Because I am actually on holiday in south, in Louisiana visiting family and friends and celebrating the wonderful celebration in the South, part of the culture I was raised in two, we are celebrating Mardi Gras. If you are unsure what Motocross is I explained it in the answers way below if you want to scroll a bit. I also explain what king cake is. It's a popular baking item that we serve during the time of Mardi Gras down here.
  
  I'm having a blast.
  
  We just went to the Myrtles very popular haunted Plantation down here in the South. It is top 10 most haunted places in the USA and I got to go to it. Louisiana's most haunted place. I have been having a blast the past couple of days. Spending time with family and friends and reconnecting with people and nature. I'm really enjoying it.
  
  But yet answer your question I am kind of trying to take a small break from social media and focus on family that I don't get to see all the time. I love my family from Louisiana. Also love my family from Mississippi. But I don't get to see them from Louisiana a lot so when I do get to visit the few days that I do or the week that I do I try to spend as much time as I can with my peoples I don't get to see a lot and less time online. It's nice to take a small break but I still come on a little bit. I don't cut out cold turkey because I don't want to leave y'all hanging.
  
  But yes. Sometimes it's nice taking a break from social media for a little while. Especially YouTube. I also uploaded about 8 to 10 new videos if anybody wants to check that out. One being a Spirit Box session at the Myrtles Plantation home. Check it out the video is raw and awesome! Another one being some videos of Mardi Gras down where Another one being some videos of Mardi Gras down where I visited. Another video being a beautiful beach.

  I usually am always constantly active. Just the past couple days I have been visiting family in a different state. I don't get to see them a lot so I am trying to spend as much time as I can with them before I go back home. So I'm trying to spend a little less time on social media and a little bit more with them. How to get is quite more important. Considering every day I get on this app and all my phone. Just try to click with dater in family I guess. But yes I am active everyday multiple different times of the day on here. I enjoy being. I do not find it a job. I enjoy coming on here and talk to you guys and answering and asking y'all questions. And loving your answers and talking to you all. It's something I enjoy a lot. Keeping y'all company

   I've had a Bundt cake. Are they the same or different.
  ","
  ? Umm idk honestly.
  
  A King Cake is a circle like, oval like, snake type looking cake. It's a donut kind of cake. Usually inside of it will be some sort of jelly or just bread. King cakes usually contain cinnamon. Which those types I can't have. But that is what your average traditional king cake contains. But when I order one I usually order mine without cinnamon. It just depends on what you want. There are hundreds of different types of King Cakes you can have. Including the famous and traditional praline King Cake.
  
  Usually a King Cake can be about 1-2 ft long and a foot wide and the center is empty. They usually decorate the cakes with beads and on top there is usually icing and sprinkles. The king cake colors are green yellow and purple. Usually inside a King Cake will be a hidden little toy baby when you were eating it it's very obvious when you get the baby and if you get the baby then that means that you have to buy the next king cake. So say you're in a group of 20 people and everybody gets a slice whoever gets the baby has to buy the next king cake for them all for the next time. For the next celebration. Well of course there are different ways that everyone does it purpose is usually the everyday traditional way in doing it.

  I am really not sure with what picture you are referring to... considering I have posted about four different pictures of food... But maybe I will guess.. you're referring to maybe (but idk.. not sure which pic you mean..) but.. one of the pictures is a country fried steak. That is not pork. Is steak. That is just fried steak basically. It's a popular food in the South. It's actually really really good all it is is just a battered steak.

   Does your place of work have nice restrooms? I ask because they’re FINALLY remodeling the ones here.
  ","
  They have ones here but we only have two stalls and the bathroom is like really tiny and completely not private. Only one sink and they never have napkins in there. And sometimes I don't have toilet paper... So like you have to like carry your own in your purse almost. Really sad.
  
  And the people around here are really gross. They clean the bathrooms... yes but these people will go in there and literally blow the bathroom up and it will be completely disgusting and gross and you can't use the restroom unless you clean the entire bathroom and when you go to the bathroom you have to pee you don't have time to sit there and take 10 15 20 sometimes... 30 minutes to clean the entire bathroom before going to the restroom. When you got to go you got to go. Especially considering when I go to the restroom I only have 3 minutes to get back to the front because I am a cashier I don't think if they would like it if I sat back there cleaning a bathroom.
  
  I wish they would make a bigger and wider bathroom with maybe four or five sinks and a couple of are dryers maybe? Or maybe just have more toilet paper and paper towels? Because when you go to the restroom there should always be more paper in there than needed. Better to have more than close to none. And at least have five or six stalls or something? More than 2?? Maybe 4? Sometimes I don't even go to the restroom there. We have a Subway right next door and I like to go there because their bathroom is extremely private and it is a single bathroom. But they have another single bathroom that is separate. That is nicer and more private. They never run out of paper and they always have paper towels. And is always cleaned. 85% of the time.

   I need some date plans for me and my girlfriend any ideas
  ","
  Connecting with nature and creativity like picnics and going on boat rides and going fishing. Park walks. Bring pets. Doing things connecting with nature are always good ways to figure people out when you're our first with them. I find those kinds of dates the best but that's the kind of person I am. I'm not sure how the person you are with is like.
  
  Ummm... going to fun and productive places. Like museums but fun museums.
  
  Crazy enough. The zoo is the bomb when you're on a date. They have food and of course nature and animals are awesome.
  
  Going ice skating because you are trying something that you're not really the greatest that and they might not be either but if they are then they can help you. Working together is always a good thing and trying to connect with another person. Working together I've been trying to help one another not following your butt. Crazy enough that I can actually become pretty romantic.
  
  Sometimes taking them to a really beautiful spot around where you live at it's always a really good way to start a good first date or second date.
  
  Telling them what makes that place so special to you and why you took them there. Because you wanted to share that with them. And again... maybe bring a pizza or what are some kind of food that's delicious. Picnic time. Get you some cut fruit like a small mini mini fruit tray or something that's easy to tote and you can eat that with her. Cheese and crackers. Sammich! ?✌
  
  Boat rides are awesome first and second dates.

  Double sinks with tons and tons of room. A huge mirror on the wall and then all around the mirror dark cabinets and cupboards you can put stuff on. And then there are really nice lights around the mirror and they are LED they can change colors. And there is light all up in the roof and walls. All LED again. It's one of those stretch hallways that has a closet in the middle. It goes from the bedroom closet to bathroom. And then a giant jacuzzi tub that is centered in the Middle with tons of room to walk around it and windows all surrounding it that you can open and close and then a giant jacuzzi tub that is centered in the middle with tons of run to walk around it and windows all surrounding it that you can open and close and make dark then it has a huge upper ceiling that has a skylight. A giant flat screen 4K TV on the wall. All waterproof. Then one more closet in the bathroom that is stretched down with tons of space. Some more cabinet space all around. A whole separate room with a bidet and toilet. Then a giant rain shower (8 by 10 space) with huge indoor seats and space and an indoor bar. The bathroom it's self being huge. And then a in wall speaker system to listen to music. Waterproof. And a place to put my phone in the shower that is completely waterproof.
  
  And then lastly in the shower there is a huge Rockside waterfall wall. Basically it looks like you are in a waterfall and you can step in it and the water just comes down like a waterfall so if you get tired of the rain shower you can use that as like a shower head but it's like a natural-looking shower head. It can make the water hot and cold and it can come down completely on your entire body. ??

   What is MARDI GRAS?
  ","
  A very big celebration that we have down in the south. We can celebrate it in many different ways. Usually with family and friends.
  
  Considering the South has a big melting pot. Full of hospitality and good soul food. Cajun and Creole folks. Good people.
  
  Mardi Gras is actually French for ""Fat Tuesday,"" also called Shrove Tuesday. It is the day before Ash Wednesday, which marks the start of Lent season leading up to Easter. During Lent, us may fast, and the name Fat Tuesday refers to the last day of eating richer foods before the leaner days of Lent begin.  Because during Lent we usually fast and give up things.
  
  Basically we are appreciating life and celebrating living before Lent. Lent is a sad time in the Church for us. If you want to know more about that please look it up. Respect.
  
  But Mardi Gras is just many different types of parades and parties, celebrations and cooking lots of food and spending lots of love and time with family and friends. During the parades people will throw candy, different types of stuffed animals and beads. Different types of gifts and even sometimes money. Even foods and drinks can be given out. Little Trinkets and toys for children. Hats and masks can be worn also. Usually there are nice floats and cars in the parade sometimes there are animals. People dressed up and more. There's usually lots of music everyone is having just a great time. A lot of the time people bring their animals to the parade also. Everything is supervised. Tho Mardi Gras can be dangerous you need to be careful with where you go and who you bring. Children need to be fully supervise the entire time. Be careful.
  
  We cook things like like shrimp étouffée, jambalaya, or red beans and rice or fix something unexpected for a group of party guests like warm gumbo dip or stuffed catfish filets with a spicy rémoulade.
  
  We also have Crawfish Boil sometimes and have lots of side dishes for people. Sandwich trays vegetable trays fruit trays and more inside waiting.

  ","
  It's okay. The thumb is always hard to do.
  
  Maybe get you a little bit of nail polish remover and some Q-tips and put a little bit of nail polish remover on the Q-tip and do your thumb first before any of your other fingers and let it dry all the way theb do the other one, let it dry all the way and as you are painting them if any mess-ups, immediately if you make them use the nail polish remover on your skin and get it off of your skin and then proceeded to put more on and if you mess up again take it off of your skin only. Don't take it off completely it will smear onto ypur skin. But use the Q-tips and the nail polish remover to wipe away any skin that has contact with the nail polish. No one's perfect. Especially doing the thumb, not even professionals are perfect. Even professionals do this trick, use the Q-tip and nail polish remover trick, because they know that they're going to mess up.
  
  I hope this gave you some confidence! and know that no one's perfect doing nails.
  
  Your nails look absolutely perfect! Keep up the practice!

  You can ask yourself a question. There's nothing wrong with that.
  
  But most of the time I use people's questions. Like people will give you spaces like this
  
  -
  
  Like that or just say..
  
  space
  
  Like this.
  
  It gives you an opportunity to share whatever you like. Post a picture. Say something. Say good morning or good night. Just say anything random. Post a quote. Post a meme anything you want. But you can ask yourself a question and tell people goodnight.
  
  But as I said before I get a lot of people that send me spaces and stuff like that. I don't always use them to say goodnight sometimes I can use them for other things. Expressing myself. Posting pictures or something. But if this is what you mean. That's what I do.

  Get your mind off of them immediately.
  
  Drink water with your head tilted back just a little bit. Then be still, close your nose and put your hand over your mouth and hold your breath for about 30 seconds.

   Currently which netflix series is your favorite?
  ","
  I really like this Netflix series called Wyonna Earp.
  
  It's a little action pack and can be gory at times but it's a really good sweet story. They cover of the really bad graphic stuff. Very fantasy like. Anyone I honestly would recommend this too. It's a little cheesy at times. I would not recommend people under the age of 13 though. Maybe 14. Because it has a lot of alcohol and drugs and it shows a lot of sexual scenes. Nothing showing tho. If you don't like shows about vampires demons dragons and humans with fantasy like Powers then I would probably not watch. Also contains paranormal like things, wiccan and dark magic type practices and very demonic like practices... not a show for kids.
  
  Really good for adults.

   Have too much pain neck right side, can't move. Can you tell me some suggestions to cure this??
  ","
  I hope that you didn't sleep wrong or maybe get whiplash. You could be maybe straining your muscles...
  
  From prolonged straining (looking up or down), sleeping in an uncomfortable position, stress, chiropractic manipulation, or wearing heavynecklaces can cause you to have a hurt neck...
  
  There is also a type of disease that has to do with the nerves but I doubt that that's what's going on with you but I could be wrong.
  
  To help with...
  
  *Apply ice for the first few days. After that, apply heat with aheating pad, hot compress, or by taking a hot shower.*
  
  *Take OTC pain relivers, such asibuprofen orsomething that contains acetaminophen in it. If it is 500 milligram pills check up with a nurse on how much you're supposed to take. Sometimes you're supposed to take less or more than what the bottle says. Because sometimes it does not affect you by weight and age depending. Sometimes you can take 2 or 3 or even 4 sometimes of 500 milligram medication. But talk with your dr. on that one to make sure.
  
  Take a few days off from sports, activities that aggravate your symptoms, and heavy lifting. When you resume normal activity, do so slowly as your symptoms ease.
  
  Exercise your neck every day. Slowly stretch your head in side-to-side and up-and-down motions.
  
  Use good posture.
  
  Avoid cradling the phone between your neck and shoulder.
  
  Change your position often. Don’t stand or sit in one position for too long.
  
  Get a gentle neck massage. 10-15 mins. 4 times a day. Warm compresses are your BEST FRIEND with neck pains.
  
  Robbing a little bit of tea tree oil or mint of some sort or Icy Hot on your neck can help as well.
  
  Use a special neck pillow for sleeping.
  
  Don’t use a neck brace or collar without your doctor’s approval. If you don’t use them properly, they can make your symptoms worse

   In relationships are you the first to push someone away if you noticed a change in their behaviour to prevent getting hurt?
  ","
  Ummm. Idk. I am married and happy and don't have any problems.
  
  But from what I can remember I never really jumped into many relationships and was I knew for absolute sure that the person was into me and if they did show some sort of change in their behavior towards me.. like they aren't into me like they was before... or they are showing that they are into someone else new now?  Or just they are playing games... I usually just yeah... moved on and didn't show any more attention to them because sometimes people are just playing games... whether they are meaning to or not... it is messing with your mind and they're not serious about a relationship fully and you don't need to be in that kind of relationship because then they're not caring about your feelings... Ya see? Cause you are wanting it to get more serious. And ya wanna be with them and make something outta it. But like I said if they're changing their minds so it seems I would just move on and ignore them. They will realize that you're ignoring them and then they're going to be running back to you going oh my gosh what happened and you just need to ignore it because people like to play games. And it's just not funny.  like I said whether there meaning to or not. You're showing that you want to be with them and make something serious, if they're not showing that back then that's not the relationship for you and it's not the relationship for them.
  "

   Yea and his friend said I can see why and then after high school his friend would bring my crush up around me only in person and loom at me to see what I would do or say.
  ","
  His friend might be hinting at you too to see that his friend like you. Maybe trying to help you and him be together. As I said before I don't know how you two are together and I don't know him or you in general. But from what you told me it definitely seems like he might be interested in you. The best advice I could give you is take it slow... When you take the best relationship opportunity slow they become the best relationships.. Trust one another and work together. Patience, trust, loyalty and then the biggest thing after all communication. Tell each other everything. Be open to things to each other. And biggest thing after all be responsible about the relationship. Remember your age and act upon that age. Do not hurry anything. You're younger ages will come by faster than anything in your life... Try to stay young as long as you can.... And not try to grow up too fast. You will know what I mean when you get to the ages of 25 and 30... you will thank me and see what I mean. Take everything slow. Enjoy life.
  
  I hope that things work out for the two of you. It sounds like you'll have wonderful futures together. I hope I helped.

Luckily I got him to the doctor and some medication. He got to eat good today because he didn't feel good yesterday and he got to sleep by me all night and all morning.

  As a child I thought all adults were heroes. But the day that I saw an adult act completely rude disrespectful toward someone else it changed my view. I was so confused in why they did that.. It made me realize that not all adults are not heroes and that I need to be more careful with who I let in and talk to me. I grew up in a private school so everyone around me that was older, responsible good hero like adults. Like they were good influences on me. They wouldn't hire just anyone to take care of us at that school. So I always grew up around really really good folks. And then when I got into High School it was a public school and everything changed. But my experience actually happened while I was in middle school still. Even though we had so many good upper teachers we still had a bad apple every now and then. Everywhere has them.

He also got me these cute diamond pens that I have been trying to order offline, but for some reason they keep not coming in. So he got them down for me. I love them. They are gorgeous pins. Very heavy. Perfect for drawing and creating. One is rose gold. And the other one is Silver. The ends of them. One of them is pinkish and the other one is purple like amethyst. He also got me a box of old school sweethearts that have the little sayings on them. Also got me a mug for cake in a cup. We enjoy nibbling on that when are watching movies sometimes. We have matching mugs now. Also good for soup nights.
  
  And then we have gone out on a few dates, too.
  
  I got him this really cool gift basket full of goodies snacks and chocolates. Has a cute little blue balloon that is sticking out of it. A box of chocolates is surrounded by a cute rose and some decorations too. Ribbons. Makes the box of chocolates really pretty too. And he loved it. I also got him a new wedding band. He went down to ring sizes. He absolutely Adores the new wedding band.
  
  I love you Jason! Happy Valentine's Day to you, honey!
  
  Happy Valentine's Day to you all!

All you see is different? If you do not know me, then there is no way that you can truly hate me. Get to know me, then judge me based off of who you have spoken to. Cuz I promise you now.... Because if these haters put in the effort to actually get to know me..? they wouldn't even hate and/or envy me.
  
  Instead of hating on everyone elses successes... Why don't you get up and produce some of your own. ? Because we are all human and we all have the ability to do anything that we set our minds to.

Really really cute. I was looking at it and he just came up to me and took it out of my hand and put it in the buggy.

LOL I told him, you know, you don't have to put everything in the buggy that I want and I'm looking at. He said but I'm getting it for you. LOL Anything you want. I said geez I better stop looking. ?
  
  He ended up buying me like three or four things that day. But I told him that I really want some flowers on Valentine's Day. I love flowers. Some Magnolias Maybe. And then I think that he got me this big giant red fluffy pillow and a huge box of chocolates. And they have like this really nice velvet like outside to it. Really nice sweet gifts. ❤ Every year we go all out for Valentine's Day. Haha.
  
  He also got us these really cute mugs in the store. We like to eat cake in the cup together when we are watching movies. So he bought those because there are the perfect size for cake in a cup.
  
  We even have a meal plan food and pork chop sausage steaks. We're doing everything.

   Tell the story of meeting a friend of yours for the first time?
  ","
  I remember 6 years ago meaning Jason unexpectedly on Xbox 360 on game called GTA V. We became really really good friends. And then we became really really close. Meeting back and forth, all the long distance and back and forth... for four and a half years. Then we finally moved in together and we got married and we are loving every minute of our lives together. Are happy and everything. Sounds like something out of a storybook... Lol.. But it's a true story. It happened. It's us! We did the impossible! ??? I always like talking about it because it's just one of my greatest life achievements. ? Something that was just really hard to battle and get through. But we did it.

   Do you think smoking is - for the lack of better term - “cool”? ?
  ","
  No.
  
  Smoking is not cool.
  
  It's honestly just supposed to be a stress reliever. But really you shouldn't smoke. The smell just gets absolutely everywhere. And if you smoke when you have white walls, it can go as far as making your walls yellow.... Your nails yellow.. Dry out your skin and lips. Make your breath stink some or even all the time. I am talking about cigarette smoking.
  
  If you're talking about a different thing. Some people use that as a reliever also and also for medication. It shouldn't be used as a cool thing. You shouldn't have abuse anything.

  You are most welcome. When my husband sees me really upset he will pull up videos of puppies being silly or taking care of babies. Or he will look up bird videos because we really want to get a pair of birds.

   Am I a bad person for being bisexual, I believe in god but some people think it is a sin for liking the same gender
  ","
  Your not a bad person.
  
  No.
  
  People will eventually come around. At least the ones that truly care about you and want to be in your life. If they don't want to be in your life anymore than they don't care and they don't need to be in your life. What a good way to pull out toxic people in your life. You don't need toxic people.
  
  And you're going to have to accept the fact that people don't like some people that are bisexual or gay. There are people that are like this and if you want to be bi, you're going to have to learn to ignore people. People are hateful. People want to make you miserable and sad. People like to see people miserable and sad. You have to learn to be mentally stronger or you're going to be miserable for the rest of your life if you're caring about what someone thinks of you.
  
  I don't care what people think of me. I grew up like a tomboy around guys all the time. Wore very comfortable clothing and enjoyed getting dirty and playing sports and stuff. I liked alot of the things that guy's likes. People thought I was gay and called me all kinds of names but I wasn't gay. I was just a tomboy. I was very much like a girl. Still like to wear dresses, but very seldomly. And still like to wear makeup and look pretty. And like two guys. And only guys. These are just things that I liked. Guy things. But I didn't care what they thought of me. I still kept being me and ignored them. Eventually. They left me all alone. Jealousy is a thing.
  
  Do what makes you you and makes you happy and ignore all the rest. People will go as far as threatening you and hurting you, but you need to just walk around it. They want to see you sad and miserable and behind bars... because even people would try to get a reaction out of you. Do not give them that. Ignore them. Kill them with kindness.

  Our dogs are really good and well behaved. And though at times the mama can be a little hard headed, but that's because she is a overprotective mama. But honestly what human being or animal is not hard-headed a little bit? And stubborn? honestly she barks at people, but she'll walk up to you and let you pet her and then she will be your best friend. She is the black and white one in the pictures. She is about 8 to 7 years old.
  
  G is a sweet darling and a goofball. He is a hunting dog. He knows when to be sweet and he knows when to be serious. But literally 98% of the time he has a goofball and it's a sweetheart. But when I tell him to get into hunting mode, he listens. He is the son of Dixie and He is about three years old. Is the golden red Brown looking dog in the picture. He is very muscle looking very built. Fast. He will get the Zoomies on you. ? Very hyperactive dog. But knows when you are upset and will make you feel better. Same with Dixie.

   Do you prefer brand names or are you ok with using the store or generic brands?
  ","
  I look at reviews a lot of the times or read the backs of things before I buy them. Because sometimes the generic stuff is better than the brand stuff or it's literally the exact same and a generic is like two and a half $3 cheaper.
  
  Unless you're talking about like Nikes and Jordans and journey shoes. I don't mind generic shoes either but a lot of the times I like on brand shoes because those seem like they last a little bit longer. But again the same thing applies sometimes the generic shoes work better than a pair brand one's. Never know. Anything's possible.

  The wind and lightning are gone. No more tornado warnings. It's still very gloomy out and wet. The sun has not really came out at all today, but it is better than it was yesterday. I am so happy that there are no more tornado warnings. We have a few little trees down but nothing severe. We are all okay and we have power. I really appreciate your concerns. But yes, my friend, we are okay. Thank you again.
  
  We had a few confirmed tornadoes that were a few miles from us. Very scary. But as I said before we are okay.

   Does anyone have any advice on how I can make my migraine go away?
  ","
  Well.. I'm def late but... here ya go. Srry.
  
  Sleep is number 1 best.
  
  Drink a bottle of water right now. The whole thing. Eat some fruit. Get hydrated.
  
  Let go of any stress as much as possible... This can cause a lot of headaches.
  
  Get away from looking at bright lights for a little bit.
  
  You'd be surprised but sometimes you lose track of how much water you have really consumed in a day. Make sure you drink enough water in the day. If you get a headache try to down a water.
  
  Sometimes getting out and going for a walk can help with headaches. Surprisingly. A little bit of exercise.
  
  Sometimes sipping ginger tea can help.
  
  Avoid Nitrates and Nitrities, they are common food preservatives added to items like hot dogs, sausages and bacon to keep them fresh by preventing bacterial growth.
  
  And in canned foods sometimes. Avoid this while having a headache.
  
  Herbal remedies.
  
  Avoid any type of strong smells for a little while. Also sounds. For these could be reasons why you have a headache.
  
  Relax with something. Maybe do yoga or get in the shower and take a soothing shower or bath.
  
  Acupuncture... But honestly, I wouldn't do this unless someone does it for you... A pro.
  
  Sipping on beverages that contain caffeine, such as tea or coffee, may provide relief when you are experiencing a headache.
  
  Studies suggest that
  
  food intolerancescan trigger headaches in some people. So basically, if there's a food that you've been eating a lot of lately. Try to lay off of it a little bit. Will helo decrease headaches. Maybe. With doing this, I would consult with your doctor.
  
  Try a cold compress.
  
  Maybe try different vitamins put again consult with your doctor before trying.
  
  Essential Oils? They help.
  
  Apply chest rub(can be applied more than on the chest) to the temples on your forehead and sometimes around the sides of your nose. The mint smell is soothing.
  
  Avoid foods high in Histamine
  
  Limit Alcohol
  
  Take some Magnesium?
  
  Read up on before taking.
  
  Talk with a nurse or dr again.

   Would you mind sharing what you do for Mardi Gras? (For those of us who have never been, there is a bit of a stereotype)
  ","
  Lol. There are many stereotypes to everything nowadays.
  
  There is the big Stereotypes that Mardi Gras is just a bunch of parades and wh*res on the side of the road showing their private parts to get really good things thrown to them. And that's not always the case, but we do have those kinds of people at parades when we do have the parades... And they have friendly oriented parades and then they have parades that they warn you not to bring children.
  
  Mardi Gras. This is an actual really religious thing down in the South. It's love. It's a very wonderful respectful celebration that people celebrate in south Louisiana mostly.
  
  Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of the Epiphany and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday.
  
  Mardi Gras is also a big melting pot type celebration. Lots of culture food. Seafood boils. King cake, beignets. Just a big giant celebration of our culture.
  
  And any religion can celebrate it. I don't single out certain types of religions. But we will celebrate Mardi Gras from Christmas all the way till March nearly.
  
  There are moments that we feast and there are moments that we fast.
  
  Mardi Gras can be for or anyone.
  
  And there is parades that we have. And that is the form of Celebration that we do also. The parades are usually very fun and they were full of having a blast, throwing and catching things, cooking food, music. Cajun and creole culture. And so much more.

   My boyfriend is sick. He has a fever of over 100. He called into work this morning Cuz he doesn't feel well. Now's hes trying to go back to sleep. Even though he doesn't like cuddling while he's sick, how can I get him to cuddle with me until he goes to sleep?

  You don't.
  
  He's sick. ???
  
  Why wouldn't you just let him sleep? He doesn't feel well. Plus.. I'm sure he doesn't wanna get ya sick anyway.
  
  Best to just leave him to rest.
  
  Just check in with him.
  
  Only if he wants to cuddle, cuddle. Cause sometimes people want that when they are sick, but not always..

   Do you celebrate minor holidays like Valentines, St. Patrick’s, and Mardi Gras? Are there other non-major holidays that you observe?
  ","
  Mardi Gras definitely isn't a minor holiday for us Cajuns in the South. It is a quite important celebration that last a long time. Very important to out culture and other things that it follows.
  
  Same with St. Patrick's Day. To one persons culture, it may be more important than to another's. Is celebrated quite well in some countries more well than others.
  
  Valentine's Day. I don't think I've ever heard of that being a specific cultures type day or anything, but I most definitely can be proven wrong on that one, too.
  
  But I definitely celebrate any day of the year and that is a holiday. With something.
  
  Cinco de Mayo is a pretty big deal to and my household. Usually every year we do something for it. Cuz against a condom I could be a pretty important holiday for some people and to some people it's not. Just depends on culture. And even religion sometimes

  Packing a little picnic. With a blanket and a tent and going really far out on a four-wheeler and getting lost. Eating us a little dinner. Camping out by a creek. And going swimming out and watch the Sunset dive down. Have fun in the creek and then camp out by a fire listening to our favorite songs. Falling asleep under the moon light in our little tent. And then in the morning cuddle, then pack everything up and start heading our way to getting some breakfast. And then go fishing and bring our catch home, prepared together and then eat it. I know that's more than one day but that sounds like a pretty darn romantic few days to me. Sounds amazing.

   Have you ever taken a skeptic along on a paranormal investigation?
  ","
  Of course. Skeptics are most intrigued by the paranormal honestly. They want to believe so they want to experience it and see it. That's the whole point of a skeptic. They aren't going to believe it till they experience it. Which is completely understandable because that is honestly how everyone is and untill it happens to them or they see it or they experience it. Wanna hear it.
  
  It's completely fine to be a skeptic. It's just when you don't have an open mind about it is when you start being annoying. People that just make fun of people just because they are researching an interesting topic that not a lot of people would exactly research is not stupid or pointless. Or they just want to skip all of the good stuff and just call you crazy just because it seems like it can't be real. Nothing is impossible. Everything that has some sort of a theory and is meant to be researched. Whether it be proven that it's real or not. That's good to find out if something is not real. And it's good to find out if something is. Both can be a successful find. Not a fail. People have to have trial and error.
  "
40633,"
   Have you ever been hurt during an investigation? (My son is into paranormal investigation TV shows.  All these questions are from him)

  I mean you can get hurt doing anything honestly. But if you mean like have I been attacked by something? I honestly don't know if I have. If I may not have noticed or something. I'm sure I have some things happen to me and I just haven't noticed. I've had people get hurt though. Is very dangerous and it's not something that I would recommend to just random people that are not educated on the subjects. I would recommend to him do not get too into it. Do not go alone to places. Do not play with Ouija boards. They are nothing but trouble. Do not play with tools unless you know 100% what you were doing with them. Tools can summon the negative energy. You never really know what you're talkin to truly. Demons/negative energy can trick you. You have to know how to undo what your doing, like when you go to using the tools, you have to know the works of after protection and prayer. Sometimes some people get really intrigued and interested in the Paranormal life that they get too interested and end of summoning things into their life they're almost near to impossible to get rid of... they can attach to you, they can attach two items, they can attach two places and they will follow you. They can affect your family and hurt people. I say... Be very careful. Just stick to watching things and researching. Make sure you have faith in something and have lots of prayer in your life. Having faith in something can give you protection.

  Everybody has views and preferences and it's okay to disagree and agree.
  
  These are honestly quite soft subjects for a lot of people to talk about and can create unnecessary conflict.
  
  Even without wanting to trigger something you could accidentally, so that's why I choose to not talk about it on the internet and just keep them to myself, then which I think people should do more.

   What song is powerful enough to make you cry? Is there a reason it does?
  ","
  Photograph by Nickelback. Just brings in all the memories of everyone. Including people that have passed. Good Times. Plus it's just a really strong song in general. Another song is What Hurts the Most. Another song about a few people that passed. Anything by Christina Grimmie is hard to hear. But it's also good to hear. A song by Ariana Grande called one last time. I remember the really bad tragedy in Manchester and it brings tears to my eyes but it's also an amazing song. Another song is Symphony. It's just a really really sad song. Another really hard song to care and Saint is concrete angel. If you've never seen the official music video you need to go and watch it and I think you will understand what I mean.

But I am proud of myself because a lot of people say that people wouldn't stick around and help someone for that long but with me it is not a question. Through sickness and health. I love my husband and I don't care what happens I will take care of him. Even if it happens again and again. Same thing back to him. He would take care of me.

   Stolen from one of my anons;

""What do you look for in a partner?""
  ","
  Strong minded.
  
  Positive.
  
  Lots of confidence.
  
  Especially the confidence of knowing that they're able to take care of themselves and another person and even another person.
  
  Someone that is not over possessive. Not controlling or too jealous. Being any of these too much. Being any of these too much can ruin a relationship.
  
  Someone that wants to communicate and work things out and work together..
  
  Someone who is respectful to themselves and to others obviously. Respectful to all people. Both girls and guys. I never could stand or understand people that control people on who they hung out with and how many? Pick their friends. Especially based off of religion and race and personal views... And then expected them to treat everyone else horrible but them. Only be able to speak to their partner and no one else. This is not how people should be. They should be kind and want the same respect for all human beings, animals, things. Everything. Your partnership want you to socialize with other people. Help others and be kind.
  
  I like someone that's understanding and caring and wants to listen. Wants to give advice help one another.
  
  Hygiene plays a very big role in a partner for me. You have got to be organized or at least a little bit or know when you need to be. Be clean and have your area cleaned. Environment.
  
  You have to have some sort of Faith or hope and something. Determination. Passion. Patience. Patients plays a big part in a partner for me. You have got to be patient.
  
  I want a family one day.
  
  Have to have all of your priorities straight. Both parts.
  
  And of course one hundred percent love one another. Be spontaneous and surprise with one another. Be loving and romantic at times. Want to Adventure and have fun in the world. ❤ ?‍?‍?‍???

  Just being able to differentiate between right and wrong. Having a conscience. Random acts of kindness and then not expecting a thank you then returned. Not expecting a favor or a reward and return. Not even a praise. You just do the kind act and then move on. That is how it should be. Kindness in general. Not being so negative all the time. Be able to turn people's day is around. And even if your day is going bad, to be able to turn your own day around. Be able to ignore hate. To love. To accept. To have some kind've hope or faith.

We also have this little Chihuahua but it is my husband's grandmother's Chihuahua and he for sure looks at me like I'm the world.

   Have you ever actually got revenge? I did once (serious revenge) and afterwards I just felt empty and soulless, especially after I had been building up the moment for years and my cousin was in the car asking how I was feeling and if I feel better now? I didn't feel better and I still don't today.
  ","
  Sometimes revenge isn't always the answer, I guess. Even though how much we want to seek it, we shouldn't. We should learn to forgive or forget or both.
  
  Sorry that you are feeling this way. At least you're having a conscience about it. You're being realistic. You're thinking.

  It's a glitch that Ask.fm does when some people go offline. It glitches us into another leaderboard server. It happens to a lot of people on here and I don't know why. It's completely uncontrollable. 100% a glitch and I wish that they would fix it. So that's why. It's not supposed to glitch us over into another but does sometimes.

  I'm sorry that that's happening to you. But I am definitely a person of people constantly having people coming at me even though I'm married. Like.. some of them think just because if he's not near me or around me that I can send pictures to them? and I'm just not like that? ...so I tend to have to block a lot of people... stop talking to them and it's sad.. this world has became so... just yeah... no one cares anymore. And thrn.. then a lot of people get really angry when I deny them and just tell them no, they get all psychotic and stuff and it gets really dangerous and people get obsessed... Yeah.. so I just try to be really careful with who I talk to and how I talk to them. Because some people mistake my kindness as flirting.
  
  But I really do hope that you're able to find someone that is going to be true to you and be serious and not be trifling about stuff. There's so many people that don't even know themselves and they want to be in a relationship with someone else. But they can't take care of themselves so how do they expect they're going to be able to take care of someone else? And handle it?
  
  Definitely take your time was it. If you rush it you will keep running into the same situation over and over again. That person will come along naturally. That's how I met Jason. Promise. Good luck.?

   Why do people only want to be with you when you are no longer single? But when you are single nobody is interested in you?
  ","
  ? I don't know. I've always wondered the same. I feel bad for some of my friends that are trying to find someone. Because the minute there was someone everybody wants to meddle in the relationship and mess it up. I guess people are just malicious and like to stir up crap.
  
  Some people find the fact that seeing that person with someone interesting. Because then they're like why are they with them? Must be something nice why? And so they don't care about the other person, they'd just want to cheat and try to take you from them. Again another malicious act.
  
  Some people are just messed up and trifling..

  I feel really bad for my friend because he was living with someone and they randomly decided to just tell him to get out. Like immediately and give him no time to find a place. So he had to talk with the property manager about giving him some time to find a place. He was able to stay but the people are treating him like crap. And I feel bad for him. They're going as far as stealing his things. Moving his things around in the house. And telling him he can't go in the kitchen and the living room or cook anything. Really cruel. People are petty. I'm more or less just saying I feel bad for my friend not really complaining. If I'm complaining about anything, it's more or less the petty part. Why do people have to be like this?? He was playing most of the bills anyway. I don't know how they're going to pay the bills. Only more than has a job and does not make even close to enough to pay all the bills. But that's their problem. But he's about to move out in just a little bit. They went as far as taking all of his dishes and putting them by the door yesterday. Now that is so petty. The crazy thing is is there not supposed to be touching his stuff and he hasn't touched any of theirs. He would press charges but honestly they're just going to keep starting stuff so he's trying his best to ignore it and just get out.
  
  I don't know why the person wants them out so bad. I think that he just feels entitled is all. Some people are like that. But I'm happy that he's finally getting out. He don't have to deal with that no more.

  It depends on his intentions when he's liking it. It definitely depends. Since I don't know him and how he is then I can't really judge to why he could be like in the photo. Me and my husband could be strolling through Instagram and we like a picture of a nice looking girl together. Or it be just him or me. But we know that we're not liking it for the wrong reasons we're just liking it because him or her looks good.

  But we just bought him a new ring and it was the right size for him but they decided to make the ring a little thicker than what we thought it was going to be so basically that 1/2 size thicker messed up reg ring size that we had him sized for...

  Definitely very educated in the Paranormal world. I could probably tell anyone and everything about it. I've been working with it for about 13 years now. Working with many tools. Going to alot of locations, dealing with many different cases, different histories in areas and places and what happened there. I've just worked alot with it for years and years. Helping guide people. Just many different levels of it all. I enjoy it.
  
  Singing. I've been singing since I was about 4-5 years old. I'm very passionate about it. I've sang for many different places, events, bars, churches, games, colleges, schools, and other different events. I even let a church choir for about 2 years. I love to sing. I enjoy giving tips and stuff. I also enjoyed taking tips from other people. Hearing other people's different ways of singing. For the longest I was going to go on American Idol but it's just so much money. So many things you have to do. I may consider doing it Monday but not right now in my life. I also enjoy watching many different singing shows also. I took a big interest in singing.
  
  Volleyball is another one that I'm really good at. I play volleyball for about six or seven years. Two of those years I was team captain. I hope take a lot of people different things with volleyball. I really like doing that. One day I maybe we'll get into coaching on that.
  
  There's a lot of things that I wish I could learn a lot more in. I want to learn more about cars, blacksmithing and way more about art. I took some classes in school but I just want to get even more into art.. I enjoy wood burning and a little wood carving. I love painting. With acrylics, oils. I enjoy building a lot of things. I absolutely love being creative. It brings the best side in me my creativity side. But I really want to get into Carpenter anymore. I feel that I need more practice in that. There's a lot of things but I need to improve on. Andthen I want to learn more about animals & how to take care of them.

Catch them. Because most of the time when people are gossiping whispering. More than 90% of the time.... it is a lie. But then again that's not always the case. Sometimes it is true but the thing about it is... why can't we all just mind our own business? and worry about ourselves? That's the point at the end of the day. Worry about you.

  Take medicine rest watch TV and try to find alternative to make myself feel better. I make sure that I tried to keep my clothes changed and fresh and shower a lot. My hands are face wash. More than often. Drink lots of fluids and try to eat things that are light with the stomach. Try to get vitamin C and B. Try to make sure that my fever is down. Maybe go and visit a doctor. Maybe talk to a nurse on the phone. Soak in a bathtub for a little bit.

   If peanut butter wasn’t called peanut butter, what would it be called? ?
  ","
  There's an actual alternative to peanut butter. It tastes exactly like peanut butter but it's not made of peanuts. It's for people to have peanut allergies. It's called Wowbutter. Obviously I guess it's made out of butter or something? And more or less other ingredients as well that I don't know about. All I know is I know someone that has a peanut allergy and they tried this ""peanut butter."" And it tastes no different. This person absolutely loves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but randomly became allergic to peanuts somehow. They were sad that they couldn't eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches anymore so they tried to research an alternative and this is what they found. They said wow butter taste no different than peanut butter and is a good substitute for people that have peanut allergies. They recommend it to anybody.

   If life were a video game, what would some of the cheat codes be? ?
  ","
  I remember when being a child... remembering one of my friends putting in a cheat code that made everything go really fast. And I mean... exceptionally fast! Lol like... cars were slamming into buildings going 300 miles an hour and people were running like at a hundred miles an hour. Random animal AI's were running at top speeds. Everything was just zooming and crashing because it was a fast cheat. It was hilarious because everything was just making mistakes and falling and crashing and exploding. I honestly don't know why but I just bought thought it was hilarious. But I wouldn't want that cheat code in real life though.... That would be really chaotic. I just thought I would share that cheat code. I just remember it. I think it was on GTA.

  I was recommended by my music teacher to were this really pretty dress that I wore to my grandfather's funeral. She wanted me to wear it to a event where I was going to sing the national anthem.

I went on stage crying and everyone felt bad for me. My teacher went off on her and demanded her to apologize to me because it was very ugly especially the fact that she did it right before I went on when I was very nervous. Plus, my teacher told me to wear it? ? I needed to focus on what I was doing. Instead.. I was confused and upset. Still did good.
  
  That same year I ended up graduating and leaving that school anyway. My teacher also left the same year. Even though she was there for years and years on end. Just goes to show you. The principal ended up apologizing to me but it was later and I believe it was in a letter.

  I just like to remain open-minded. Allow people to express themselves and the things on their mind. I don't jump to conclusions nor jump the gun when people try to explain certain situations to me because honestly everything is possible. I look at life like that.
  
  And I'm more or less try to educate people on how to go about certain things in the Paranormal field. I just promote using a lot of different objects. Especially in the wrong ways creative because they amplify negative energy. We need to try to deplete as much negative energy as we can from this world. Too much of it. But ya the paranormal is definitely a good subject to get into. But you really have to know what you're doing. It's so easy to get stuck into something but so hard to get out once you start. Then you become obsessed and then yeah... the rest can be really sad endings. Can also result in death. It can become that sad... sadly... that's why I try to remain as serious as possible about it.
  
  But yeah.

  Yeah. And no judging here from me. I have been undergoing such researches for around 13 years now. The Paranormal takes a huge part in my life. Strikes interest in me. Curiosity. I have seen, heard and witnessed a lot. It's definitely not your average everyday interest. It's also very dangerous and scary at times. Usually never done alone either. Recommended. More or less. For people can disappear... this world is full of surprises and new adventures and mysteries. Things that we can't explain.

   Hi, sorry for the really late reply! That's totally fine, I totally understand as my family also own a lot from hotels, oil refineries, fracking, land, real estate, textile mills/factories, factories world wide, and you get the idea so I'm also not going to mention the names for obvious reasons...

  Understandable 100%. And it's not that I don't trust you as an individual It's just sometimes the other people on here that like to view our stuff and get malicious with it and start stalking and stuff like that.

  As getting older I have definitely noticed that my friend count is definitely going down but is also going up but in a different way. And what I mean is the people from middle school and high school are fading away and I'm making new friends. I'm still definitely making a lot of friends online. Gives you a good opportunity. But honestly everyone in real life around me... There's so many people doing drugs and really bad things. It's hard to find someone to hang with. Ya know what I mean?

  Different types of short methods to soothe myself back to sleep.
  
  I know one thing's for sure if I read I fall asleep shortly after.
  
  Being comfortable and warmth is a good strategy.
  
  Sometimes listening to music.
  
  Adjusting the temperature in the room. Maybe adding a fan or turning up the heat in the room.
  
  Maybe change your clothes or sheets or rotate your bed.
  
  New pillow time.
  
  I heard taking a decently long lavender bath or shower helps soothe you to get ready for sleep.
  
  Sometimes getting you something to drink or a small snack in the middle of the night helps.
  
  Watch a movie.

  That was one thing that I always loved from someone was a blanket.
  
  It's just a thought of wanting to warm the other person and then having a quilt made for them and it's still have the same purpose (It's just a whole nother level up, 2 or levels up) but the fact that they sat there and spent days and weeks months and even years trying to build that quilt and put together. All the hard work put into it. All the love. It just goes to show that that message means a lot. Wanting to warm someone and keep them safe. ❤
  
  I remember covering myself with my baby blanket and it was just as long as I was and I used to be able to cover myself head to toe. Now my baby blanket is half my size. It just goes to show the years. I still love that blanket and hope to restore it. It is almost 27 years old.

  ","
  Hey. And it's okay. All good.
  
  I don't want to go exactly into the names because they are singled out markets. So people would be able to look at the locations of them. And I have family that works there if that makes any sense to why I don't want to say it. Not talking about you but they own some Associated grocery places. I will say it like that.
  
  They're really nice places to work at too. I enjoyed working for them very much. I work at another Associated grocery place just like that but a State away.
  
  And the Paranormal field I work with all kinds of different things. Different tools, help people, guide, visit different locations. Learn the history and what happened there. Just tried to inform people on stuff. There's a lot of different things that tie into it. But I enjoy doing that mostly has like a hobby kind of thing. It can be both dangerous and fun. You really want to know what you're doing and what you're messing with beforehand. I would definitely not go into it if you have no idea what you're doing.

  I usually like sugar water coffee. Sometimes I like cold and iced coffee. Frappes and even ice cream. I do like my coffee to be very strong but at the same time I still like a lot of ingredients in it too. Such as sugar mint occasionally and creamer. Sometimes I like to add buttermilk and other ingredients as well. And make it salty sometimes.
  
  If I'm looking for an extremely stout and strong coffee sometimes I will add Jameson, Baileys Irish Cream, whip cream and mint. Sounds disgusting but it's just honestly and extremely strong and delicious coffee. You just have to know how to make it. I do not recommend people that like sugary coffees. The last one that I explained at least. That coffee is very very very strong. This is a picture of it below that someone made me at a restaurant we went to.

   Have you ever seen something paranormal? Can you tell about the most interisting experience?..
  ","
  Working with it as long as I have. The whole 13 years. I have seen a lot of different things. I've seen a lot of really evil and scary things and I've seen a lot of things that are annoying and let you know that they're there.. but don't seem very evil if that makes any sense? I've had multiple people around me witness the same things and the kind of all looked at each other and question of what it was. Considering it so unexplainable.  I mean I've witnessed thousands of things.. A ton..  We've seen doors open and close in front of us. When there is nothing there no wind no force. We sit there trying to figure out what could have made it move but nothing. Me and a few people will be sitting in a room and then get up and go in the other room and come back into that room and things have been moved around that no one touched originally. This happens a lot. Hearing groups of people talking and there's no one there. This is just a few things of many. I've had friends get attacked randomly and nothing was touching them they never bumped their arm or has someone hit them just miraculously had scratches all over  or burns or may have been touched or shoved. Start to feel choked. The paranormal world is very confusing and interesting. Leaves you on wonder to what could be there. We tried to ignore but sometimes it's hard to ignore it when it's trying so hard to let us know that it's there. Some people experience it it while others don't. It's kind of just random.
  
  And it's okay to be a skeptic. I have no problem with people that don't believe in it or maybe just don't see anything in it because they haven't seen anything happen before. That's fine I respect other people's views.

  ","
  The thing about it is.
  
  You only see me on this screen. You don't know me know me. What I do and what I wear on a day to day basis. Who I hang out and who I have grown up around and how.
  
  My whole life growing up I played football with the guys on their team. Was pretty much the only girl playing. And if there was another girl she would usually quit or only play for one day because she didn't want to keep playing because they would either be too rough or it would be too muddy or she wanted to hang out with the girls. Used to tackle and get covered in mud and everything. Loved this. I still do this. I fish. I hunt. Love working on vehicles. I love to build things and go bike riding and 4-wheeler riding. And at times I do love chilling and being a girl because I'm a girl. At the end of the day. Yeah I look cute and pretty and girly in some of my pics because I like that too because I am a girl. But being a tomboy does not mean you have to always look like one and always have to act like one. It's how you been raised and what you were raised around. I was raised out on the countryside and out on the Bayou.
  
  My whole life growing up I was raised around boys and guy friends. Girls and other tomboys. We used to wrestle and fight and teach each other how to defend ourselves. Jump on trampolines. Play street ball and build our own fields and club houses out of things out of trash. Sometimes still do this when I have the time. Get outside and sometimes just dig a hole just to get dirty. Just now I chased my dogs all the way across the yard and got covered in mud. I have to come inside and clean up and now I'm laying down because I'm cold from the water. But I had a blast. Tomboy from the heart. Always will be. It's in my roots.

  But I wouldn't do too many of the gargling stuff. Just pick one that you want to do per day. The one that I mostly recommend would have to be the hydrogen peroxide one. You could probably add a little bit more water to it ( just make sure that the water is warm. Super super hot. It will soothe your throat) and what I said but just don't add more than 1/4 cup of water maybe. But you can do the ricola cough drops the one with the medicine that numbs your throat in them. I would take those as your throat hurts. And then spray the Chloraseptic continuously ( get a flavor that you like. I think they have cherry and spearmint and mint and Bubblegum) in your throat as the day goes so it numbs your throat. Suck on cough drops to numb and and mints. Then when you come home I would so the step with the honey and tea and bourbon. And then right before you go to sleep I would do the little gargling and stuff but make (with the hydrogen peroxide again) sure you don't eat or drink and lay down immediately after. The remaining hydrogen peroxide that touched your throat will soothe your throat and make it better. I would try this combination throughout your day of things. It will keep your throat painless and it will help speed up the process of getting better. This is what I do when I have a sore throat and it usually helps. You're more than welcome. I don't like sore throats either so that's why I try to help others when they are sick. I got these remedies from other people by the way they're not just one that I made up.

   What’s your typical remedy for a sore throat?
  ","
  Get plenty of rest
  
  Drink fluids
  
  Try comforting foods and beverages
  
  Number one thing to gargle is hydrogen peroxide (add just 3 tablespoons), warm water (6 tablespoons) mint mouthwash (the type of mouthwash that doesn't have alcohol in it) (3 tablespoon) and a little bit of salt the mix together and gargle 3x times (make sure all of this is warm) gargle that and then do not drink or eat for 30 minutes, usually lay down for an hour, maybe take a nap after. This helps to attack the acids that are hurting your throat. Will speed uo the sore part process. DO NOT SWALLOW THIS. Usually take this at the beginning of the sore throat and do about three times of day. Do not do too much or it may irritate it too much.
  
  Then you can....
  
  Gargle with salt water
  
  Humidify the air where you were at
  
  Consider lozenges or hard candy (helps numb pain)
  
  Get Chloraseptic spray (helps numb pain)
  
  Take some medications too
  
  Like Benadryl or Tylenol
  
  Warm tea mixed with honey and sometimes people add a little bit of bourbon to it to help numb and soothe throat.
  
  Any types of salt water. Usually warm water with it
  
  Chamomile tea
  
  Peppermint
  
  Baking soda gargle
  
  Chamomile tea
  
  Fenugreek
  
  Marshmallow root
  
  Licorice root
  
  And waaaay waaaaaay more.

  ","
  I mean it's good to worry about yourself and your family and make sure that they're safe but we all need to work together to make the world a better place so we can live in it.. that's really important. Because if the water that were drinking out of the faucet isn't clean then how are we supposed to stay hydrated. Besides just going to the store and getting bottled water, what happens if this runs out? This opportunity? What happens if a lot of meat starts going bad and then we have to go to the store to buy some but they don't have any? It's important to hunt and to remember this skill. Because sometimes you got to do it to survive. What happens if a small apocalypse does breakout? We need to go to protect ourselves and help one another. What happens if all the bodies of water become contaminated and we can't go swimming in it at all. Then we just can't go swimming anymore. It's important if we make sure that our environment is clean and we take care of it.

   Is being unsociable bad? Why/Why not?
  ","
  Ehhhh depends on what level of unsociable you mean. If you don't talk to anyone 24/7, that is not healthy. It is good for everyone to be a little social in their life. It helps stretch your communication skills. It helps with your comprehension and handling certain situations also. You do not want to be completely unsocial. Cuz I promise you... it's not healthy.... But if you don't really favor having conversations with people on a daily basis there's nothing wrong with that. You just don't prefer that. And you don't have to do it everyday all day. Even calling someone on the phone for 10 minutes is healthy and good for you. But some people are more shy than others. Some people just don't like people. But if you are the second one I would honestly try to stretch your social skills when you get the chance. Stretching your social skills can do a lot of good for you and your life. It can open good opportunities and certain successes that aren't open to other people that are not as sociable..

   OMG thank you. You're the second person to tell me that. Wen did this oil spill happen? I'm not too up to date on news.
  ","
  April 20, 2010. I don't even remember but all I know is they try to fix it by putting a different bacteria in the water to kill off the oil and it made it worse. ? And then I think they had a second oil spill or something somewhere. And... It's just a lot of contamination people throw all kind of stuff out there. Plastic.... It's just a horrible horrible body of water to swim in. I wouldn't even touch it. You can probably walk out there but I would definitely wear some kind of rain boots and don't touch the water. But if you are down there and want to walk on the beach I would think that's okay at least but I know some YouTubers that don't even go on their jet skis out there anymore because they barely touch the water and got sick. It can attack your skin and if it gets in your bloodstream, it can kill you. I literally watched somebody get a hole in their skin and it got worse and worse they had to get some of the craziest antibiotics to get rid of it. It was scary. But they got better from it. I just warn you because I don't want that to happen to you.

And also when we celebrate our first year anniversary. When we got our dog I was very happy. Raised him up from a pup. Graduation was very awesome. I was very happy for that. My 10th birthday. My 16th and 18th and 21st birthday. Those were all awesome. Lots of get-togethers with my family and friends. I love Christmas time. Every year. These are the times when I am most happy.

  How do I feel about it? Well I'm not really sure what kind've answer your looking from me.
  
  But I don't have a problem with anyone and anything they want to do. I don't have a problem if a girl likes a girl. Or if a guy likes a guy or if they are whatever they choose to identify as. I think everyone has the right to do what they want. Everybody has the right to be who they would like to be. I think those kinds of people should be left alone or really what I mean by that is... they wouldn't be judged for that as long as they're not hurting anyone I don't see the problem in it. ???
  
  Especially if someone feels uncomfortable with the body that they are in and they want to change themselves. I don't see any problem in that? If it's possible then why not let them do it as long as it's not hurting them or anyone else. At the end of the day I think people just need to mind their own business and let people do them. Though I don't appreciate people that like to push their views on people that don't like their views. I think everyone's entitled to believe whatever they want. At the end of the day as long as nobody is hurting anyone mentally or physically then I think that there's nothing wrong with any of that. Also I feel that everyone should remember that this is life and we are all here for a reason and we have to figure out what that Destiny is. If that's what they have to do to get to it then let them.

   Are we never allowed to judge a person? Doesn’t that make all people the same in our eyes? When is it okay to judge?
  ","
  I mean maybe judging in your mind for your own safety in deciding to be around that person at the moment and keeping yourself out of harm's way. That's different. When people are just straight up being like rude and just say things that are just ugly when you/they could just keep it to yourself/themselves, that's different there's no need to be that way. Unless of course, you see that person about to embarrass themselves then you pull them to the side and talk to them one-on-one better than embarrassing them in public and going ahead and just doing the complete opposite of what should be done.
  
  But you don't need to judge people like as in just because you see someone dressing scary you automatically assume that they might be dangerous or a bad person. That's not always the case because I used to be like that and I was nice I wasn't mean. When people got to know me they saw a different side of what they thought. Don't be so quick to judge because judging a book by it's cover one and you go to read it it's a completely different thing.
  
  Or a name of a song. Then you go to listen to it and you actually loving it and it becomes your favorite song.
  
  Or food. Don't knock it till you try it.
  
  Meeting a person and then is automatically decide you don't like them... when you actually haven't even had a conversation with them yet.

   What’s up
  ","
  ? Hey
  "
41682,"
   In your opinion, Is heat or cool temperatures better for any injuries or sick situations. Lets sat a fever. I’ve been told by that it’s better to just sweat out the sickness. Which works In time. And other times to sleep with a ice cold towel on my forhead to regulate body temp. What do you think?
  ","
  Basically when you have a fever obviously your body temperature is higher than normal. You are warm inside so of course the outside of you would be cold and you feel that you are cold because it is your skin, the surface of your body that is cold. You do not want to bundle up and you can put a towel on your head but... it doesn't really mean it's going to reduce your fever but if you more or less try to drink cold fluids that is getting the inside of your body temperature to go down some. Yes I guess sweating out the temperature could be better but honestly sometimes people temperature just keeps getting higher. Medications and Tylenol and fever reducers or what you should turn to. Try to figure out what your body is lacking such as Vitamin C. Stay hydrated. Take showers. But under any circumstances don't bundle up because then you're just making the surface temperature of your skin hot too and that is honestly just making things worse. Even though you feel cold does it mean that you are really cold.
  
  Ex: Have you ever went into a pool and swim for a good while and it was cold in the pool but your body or your skin adapted to the temperature in the pool with the new you want to the restroom it felt like when you pee it was hot because the inside of you is actually hotter than the surface of your skin.
  
  This is a good example of how my statement becomes true and what I said about you feeling like you're cold but you're not really. Either your body is the regular temperature or can be hotter. It just all depends. At the end of the day you should do a lot of research if you are sick and you're trying to figure out how to get better or really just visit your doctor and they can help you. And you don't have to do the research or take risks and doing the wrong research and waiting longer to get better.

41823,"
   Please can someone help. I put this stone on my mantlepiece and then it ends up on my bed without me putting it there! What could be the logical explanation for this?
  ","
  What kind of stone is this? Because some rocks symbolize different types of energy and it could be a positive energy or stone and there could be an energy when you were living at and it may have moved it to your bed for better/more protection. I know this is a lot of assuming but if that rock is a good energy rock or crystal it can have good symbolization and energy. If you have positive energy(positive spirit), they can move things, that's what they have heard to do and they might have moved it to your bed to give you more protection. They always say to have the circle around your bed protected with salt(lightly) and to bless your room and all of the doors in your house. This is just the same you don't have to do it. I'm just simply answering your question based off of information that I know. Hopefully I helped. Shouldn't be anything negative. Should be positive

   Thoughts on the military? ?
  ","
  For the longest back in junior year I was going to join the military. I was going to join the Army or the Marines. I was headed more towards the Army. But also was looking at the Navy. I have a high respect for the military. I have hundreds of friends that are in the military. Also tons of family. Sometimes I feel bad for the military because of course they have to do what they are told. A lot of them being terrified at some moments. Being away from their family and friends for a long periods of time. Making sacrifices. Risking their lives for us, to keep us safe and I have a huge respect for people that do that. Just recently we had a lot of Army and firefighters go out to Australia and help with the bushfires. We're also trying to help other people. There are many different branches in the military. Many different things that they all do. But the reason why I did not join because I met Jason right around this time when I was going to go in. At the time I wasn't with someone or I think I was with someone but I was not happy... they were not treating me right.. so I felt like something was missing from my life. I wanted something more so I turned to the military. But right before I joined that's when I met Jason all that changed. It made me look at life differently. I wanted a family and to be a mama instead. I chose not to go in and instead be with him. I feel like I chose the right thing. ❤
  
  Are used to write people in the military and everything. I'm a huge supporter of I'm a huge supporter of our US Military.

I have never bought coins on here or did any of that. It's honestly a waste of money. His app is not that serious. You can also watch ads but honestly that's a waste of time. Honestly just earn them.

Plus, considering my phone number is also my husband's phone number I really don't think that he would appreciate it if I gave out my number to random people that I don't know on the internet. Especially people that are posted as Anonymous want to public site were hundreds and thousands and probably more can see this post.
  
  I don't have any other social media. No one is getting my phone number. As my privacy. If you need to tell me something you can tell it to me on here.

   ok so i got added into one of these moms groups from my area and there was a question posted asking should men be allowed to have friends of the opposite .sex. if they’re in a relationship? what’s your input?
  ","
  Any human regardless of being in a relationship should have the opportunity to be friends with whoever they want. It just depends on how far they take the friendship with that other person. There are boundaries. You want to make it known that you were in a relationship and that you were not interested in them whatsoever and that all you have to offer is friendship. Especially if you were already friends with that person before you met the relationship person, usually there's nothing you have to worry about. But if you see signs of strange activity then something is going on in between them and I would not get involved until you know for sure that they are completely done with any type of relationship type stuff with each other. You're not want to share your man or woman with another human being. No person should be like that unless you agree to it. To try to tell them not to hang out with anyone that is the opposite-sex is controlling.. TELLING THEM THEY CAN'T AT ALL. You want... your better half to socialize with anyone and everyone and to be friendly to the opposite sex. To respect them. Showing that they respect another person like you shows that they will respect you. That's how I feel about it. Ex: When I see my husband trying to protect a random woman that is being abused I find that a kind act.. And inwhich this has happened before... I would want him to keep them safe. I wouldn't want him to ignore the situation.
  
  Same with me I wouldn't want to ignore the situation but at the same time... I must keep myself safe and try to think before I jump it to a certain situations. For ex: since seeing a woman getn slapped by somebody regardless of what's going on with the situation I have seen people jump into the situations and stick up for the women. No one should put their hands on another human being unless defense! We have the ability to talk things out. It never needs to get physical. No need to embarrass one another in public neither. Talk.
  
  My view on it.

   Is it possible to feel complete alone (no family, friends or loved ones)? Why?
  ","
  It's just the amount of people and activities that you do on a daily or weekly basis. I guess it's like it becomes less and less and less it makes you feel more alone. I know someone that literally doesn't have almost no family and only has a few friends but they live far away so they try their very best to talk to her as much as I can and to visit. And at that. For some people it's really hard to get out and do things just by themselves. Nowadays you have to be really careful with who you make friends with Fran the morning. Have a nice people we'll take everything you at home. If you be driving around naked trying to kill you and just try to take your car. Rob you for just twenty bucks. It's a crazy world we live in nowadays. As I said you have to be careful

  My hair.
  
  I would honestly like to go into detail in describing how I take care of my hair and keep it up. I try not to wash my hair too often because is not good for really really long hair. Washing your hair too often can thin it out and I have always heard.. Too clean or too dirty can make a home for lice.
  
  My hair goes all the way down past my back. My hair is about 3 ft long. My hair is dark brown originally. It is dark brown with highlights. The highlights that I have in my hair are gold light brown and burgundy colors. I like for them to resemble fall colors and Indian colors. I just really like those colors they're really pretty and they shine well in the Sun. I keep up with my hair very much. I like to straighten it every now and then. I do not blow dry my hair or straighten it very often because it damages the hair. I actually don't dry my hair at all I let it dry on its own. I spend a good bit on my hair to make sure it is healthy and taking care of.

Regardless of it hurting your feelings or not. Do what your supposed to be doing... Do not lie.. on me or anyone I know right in front of me... or your gonna get a mouth full of truth thrown at chya'.
  
  And this isn't me saying this to be ""scary"" or ""intimidating""... No. This is me saying it like this because I'm being 100. This is how I am and how I will react 100%. Truth. That's it.

Ever since then I have been around him and have been raising him. Same as the other dog have been raising and taking care of both of them. They're both pitbulls, dogs. Ones named Dixie and the other one's name is G-Fred.

   What kind of flowers should you give to a girl?
  ","
  We really like something different. Not the everyday red roses but those are pretty. Me for my wedding I had dark pink light pink white and red roses with baby white flowers and a lot of green leaves. I personally really liked that, it was really pretty. I absolutely love tulips. The smell of them is amazing. Hadrian's are really nice. Baby roses are really nice. I absolutely love Magnolias! Magnolia State and living in a magnolia state  obviously I would like that. What's the Magnolia leaves are so pretty and so are the green leaves that come with them. They're such a strong flour and smell great! Wild flowers are gorgeous. Honestly the sweetest flowers for me to get from my husband would be just random wildflowers that he found because I feel like he took the time to think of that idea pullover go and find them cut them and then put them together himself and give them to me. I think that that is so sweet. Other girls are probably say different but I'm a country cajun gal and again to see my husband go out of his way and do something like that is absolutely adorable, romantic and sweet.
  
  Chrysanthemum flowers are really pretty. These are usually put in a bouquet to add character. But they still are really pretty by themselves. Especially the random color ones. But they can be very expensive. That's why they're usually only added to bouquet because they're expensive. Usually only one two or three are added to a bouquet.
  
  Daisies smell absolutely amazing.
  
  Carnation. Beautiful.
  
  Orchids
  
  Dahlia
  
  There are so many flowers that you can give a woman. Some women don't even like flowers. Another flower that's awesome is eternity roses. They lasted very long time but are expensive and people that don't like flowers may actually like these. Cuz usually because I don't like flowers is because they die so quickly. This is a good recommendation for people like this. Make sure your woman is not allergic to them either! That might be one reason why they don't like them!

  ","
  Just try to work together. Be known when you're doing something. Say for instance... When you're washing the dishes, be like, ""Hey hun, I'm going to go and wash the dishes,"" or when you're done come in the other room and be like, ""Okay! ? Dishes are washed! I gotchu!"" Don't say it in an ash way... or like an attitudinal way... Just say that you did it and then move on. If they(she) wants to be attitudinal about it just be like ... Oh well! ? At least I did it without being asked. And you can even say that. And keep being like that and they will surely catch on. If not that's a shame... They should appreciate that. Even if you haven't done it in a while or don't do it a lot. Both halfs have parts they have to play in the household. Even the kids. Kids should have chores. And they don't exactly have to do ones they don't like but they should at least do one that they don't like. Try something new. When I was growing up we had to do certain things in the household and I didn't mind because I was helping my mom and stepdad out. Say for instance my sister didn't really like vacuuming, so I would vacuum for her. But I didn't really mind vacuuming. And I didn't really like cleaning the bathroom, so my sister would clean the bathroom. And since the vacuuming is not really that big of a job I would also do the clothes. I would pick them up or fold them and she would have fold them or pick them up. If we made dishes we had to clean our own. If we were the last one to drink the tea then we have to make the tea or at least help make it together & no.. the woman don't always clean and cook.. The guys want to do that too sometimes. Guys like to cook! And the guys don't always do the carpentry and outside work. Sometimes girls like to do this. Mix it up. Work together more. Both do the dishes together sometime or maybe both go outside a new yard work together. Or both build something together maybe. Or do laundry together you wash and dry them and she told them or the opposite.

We go to Louisiana about four or five or six times a year. That's where my mama lives so we go and visit her and my family and friends.

   What is the lowest test score you've ever gotten? ???
  ","
  I honestly always did very good in school but one class was really hard for me and it was physical science. I don't know if it was just the teacher or what but she would teach and it would be very basic and not very explaining and helpful. Especially the people that didn't understand on the first try. Honestly I was in freshman here and honestly I feel like she was teaching it at a senior if not college level. I've literally handed her the test with not a single thing written on it but my name because I didn't understand a single thing on there. And I would pay attention in class and everything. At some point I would just write random letters and numbers because I did not understand anything. I think honestly she thought everyone in the class learned quickly and was fast-paced and that was not the case and I think that she should have maybe did more one-on-one or maybe slow down with the teaching I would have gotten it. The thing about it is when I went home and actually studied it and tried my best and did my research I would complete projects at 100%. But in class she would hurry up through the lesson and I would not understand anything. And when I went to ask her to help me she would make it seem like I was stupid and dumb for not understanding it so I would just stop asking for help because I mean... Why make someone feel that way? And makes them not want to ask for help and want to learn. No motivation. At least this is what I remember. I'm not fully remembering of the whole thing but I do remember that it was very hard to learn lessons that she taught. But when I would go home and take my time I would make good grades. I think at the end of the year she started to understand how I learned and took her time and helped me and then I ended up passing. I had bad grades all the way through the year until the last semester. Then I aced everything.

  Try to look up recipes that have already dairy-free items. You would be surprised to how many awesome recipes that are online that don't have any dairy products in them at all. That's what I do.
  
  Substitutes
  
  A good idea is to find vegan type stuff. Considering vegans do not eat meat or dairy. Following a vegan diet is a very good recommendation. Though be careful.
  
  An example to this is like instead of regular butter you can find vegan butter.
  
  Like try to find dairy-free Alternatives at your local grocery store or even at a Whole Foods or a place that sells vegan type things
  
  Another idea for a substitution is unflavored unsweetened non-dairy milk for regular milk

   the point is that landlords are parasites who make a profit from causing a shortage of affordable housing and taking advantage of people who are in need of a home to call their own.
  ","
  That is not always the case. Also that is your opinion.
  
  Shoot, nowadays apartments and rental places are a fortune. Nobody can pay what they want. They want $800 for rent and more. That's not counting utilities and water and Wi-Fi. Then you have to put food on the table and you have your own personal needs as well. Plus medical and so on.
  
  I honestly appreciate the fact that they have those places available but nobody can pay those prices. But that's just me. And honestly they're probably just trying to keep up the places. So tired of seeing all of these ratings of such horrible places but yet they want to charge so much but they don't want to fix the places up. But the places I am talking about they want $800 & they are nice places. They use money to better the places up and to update them.

   why do landlords tell poor people to get a job when owning property is not even a job?
  ","
  Ummmm... do you know the amount of work that you have to put into owning a property? That is the job. Just owning it is just owning it.
  
  You have to put alot of fixing up and paying of bills and and what I mean by paying of bills you have to get all of the tenants bills to wherever they need to go so you can have water and electricity and stuff.
  
  You have to do all the carpentry and plumbing and you have to hire people to fix things and correctly. Roofing... drywall... And so much more.
  
  There is a lot of work that comes into managing. That's what that job is... is managing.
  
  Not trying to stick up for your property owner... it's just when someone owns a property that's what they are"" is a manager. I would know this because, I know people that own property and this is what they do. Plus I have helped them in many different areas to keep the properties together. Also not counting cutting grass. That is a huge part of owning a property is keeping the outside of the properties nice.

   It's even more than what's asked so thanks? But, is being controlling always bad? I mean what if they both are kinda okay with it? To be honest I felt you're talking about me LOL. Don't let that stop you from giving your genuine opinion please.
  ","
  I honestly don't know anything about you or the type of relationship you are in. But under any circumstance it shouldn't be okay for you to be controlled by anyone and to let them do that. It's okay to like choose to do it on your own that's different but if they are commanding you to do something and then you go with it that is unhealthy because nobody is in control of you no one is the boss of you. Do you see where I'm coming from?
  
  But yeah I don't know what kind of situation you were in I'm just answering it with my most honest opinion. I have been in a controlling relationship I've never been in a relationship where I control the other person unless I was keeping them safe from something harmful. Like I explained in the video. I do not do video recordings a lot unless I don't have a way to explain it properly and text. Plus I want you to see my emotion because I'm not trying to offend you whatsoever. I don't know as I said before what kind of relationship you are in so I'm not pertaining it to you as an offencive thing or being disrespectful in any wa0y no. Hopefully this video answer helped you to understand what I mean

  That's pretty awesome that you adopted a new kitten for Christmas. A new member of the family! Me and my husband got a new treadmill and rifle for Christmas. We got lots of new shoes. I got me some face masks stuff. From a good friend of mine. Finally got it some hot sauces. Some new lotion. From same friend. I'm going to get me some new cargo pants my sisters paid for them. My sister surprised me with going out and paying for the night on my birthday. My mom got me all wet brush for my birthday. I got tons of other gifts from everyone and appreciate everything I got. My most favorite gift was being able to go to South Louisiana and spend time with family and friends. I even fed my dogs good on Christmas Eve and Christmas. They got treats! Me and my husband popped fireworks on New Year's and had a blast. Thanksgiving dinner was really good and so was Christmas. My mom cooked gumbo when I was in Louisiana and some potato salad. Made bread with it. A lot has went on since  Last time we spoke. Sadly my husband has been having a few surgeries and has been dealing with an injury lately. But other than all that everything is going just fine. I've been taking care of him.
  
  Some stress here and there. But it's all good.

About traveling. About my pets. My style. I like it when people ask for advice. Or they give advice. I just like company and talking to people. I like to talk about drinks and having a good time. Explorations and Adventures. Dreams. Things that we want to do one day in our life. Education and documentaries. There's a lot of things I like to talk about. Really anything as long as it's not controversial or things that are just going to strike disagreements and arguments
  "
42131,"
   Would you hate someone who treats everyone awfully except you?
  ","
  I wouldn't hate anyone. Nor dislike. Though it would not be right if they treated everyone awful but me. A good example is some boyfriends or girlfriends are mean to everyone and anyone around them but the person that they are with. This is wrong. They should be friendly to the friends and family and that are around both of them. Another example is just a girl that doesn't like other girls and only want her girlfriend to be friends with her and no one else.l. This is not right. You shouldn't be so controlling of someone. Not make it seem like you're trying to choose their friends or the amount of people that they should hang out with.
  
  I think this is the right answer to your question. If it is not, just let me know if I answered this wrong. I might have read the question wrong.

  Self respect
  
  Respect for others
  
  That includes the reviews. I don't care what you believe in where you are from your race your gender your sexuality I do not care I treat everyone the same. Or treat them the way that they would treat me. If someone's going to be cruel to me I usually just ignore them if they do it so bad that I kind of gave him a little taste of their own medicine.
  
  When it gets too dark outside come inside. Remember yourself safety.
  
  Keep yourself clean and the environment around you. That includes what you say and how you say it.
  
  Attitude. Nobody wants to be around someone with a nasty messy attitude. Work on your attitude and try to have a positive one.
  
  Think before you do and you speak.
  
  If you see someone needing help and it's not going to affect you in a negative way or hurt you why not help them?
  
  Especially animals and people that can't help themselves.
  
  And so many more.

  If it is kind of smart and helpful criticism then I try to better myself. But sometimes some people have cruel criticism. They don't even look to try to help improve a person I just ignore that kind. That's more or less people just being ugly. But constructive criticism can also be a thing that can make someone defensive but honestly I just take it as a way to be better. But as I said it depends on how you get the criticism. Also how you take it

  It's whatever to me. It doesn't really affect me. I just feel bad for people that are already smoking and now can't buy their own cigarettes that they once were able to. But if you haven't noticed they're legalizing marijuana all over the United States maybe that had something to do with it. Maybe they didn't want people real young buying it and stuff so maybe that's why they raise the limit? Because they did all of this in the same month. At the beginning of the year. But like I said it's whatever to me.

  YES! I cannot stand it when people start talking and I'm in the middle of doing something and they know they're not supposed to be talkin even the teachers telling them to be quiet. You're almost completely helpless pretty much... And then they(teachers and graders) want to be like oh she didn't finish the test but I'm like well you(teachers) wouldn't make your kids be quiet in the classroom when I was taking it so what do you expect? I'm not going to sit there and try to take a test when I can't concentrate. ? I could miss a question or two because I didn't understand it fully. I have to read it in silence like as in... I could have made an A on the test.. But instead.. I got a B but because I couldn't concentrate enough because there was people talking in the background. Maybe if they would not have been talkin I could have made in A. It's not fair on my behalf basically is what I'm saying. People overall should just be quiet during class and not talk. It's not socializing time anyway. But sadly that's life and that's how kids are in school.

  Last year I gave up biting my nails and I really did it. I was so proud of myself my whole life I've bit my nails. I guess just the amounts of stress? But this year I'm finding it really hard to stop because last year in the middle of the year I started biting my nails again and couldn't stop. So I'm trying to stop now because I want nails again. I'm thinking about going to get them done because when I got them done last year that's what helped me stop because it wasn't able to bite them because the plastic nails were in the way. So I'm thinking about getting them done again and maybe that will help. I don't know why this is a big goal for me but it is. And I'm hoping to achieve it.
  
  I got a treadmill for Christmas and I love it and have been using it. Yesterday I walked on it for 45 minutes. I walked almost a mile. Power walked. I felt really good after and have been eating less and trying to eat more healthier. I want to get back in shape and lose some weight. This has been going well for me.
  
  My last one is I'm hoping that things just go better this year. I lost a lot of family last year. Some friends. The natural disasters have been getting out of hand. I'm just hoping that that help look for 2020 is good. ? thanks for asking this question because I really enjoyed answering it

  I used to love going to Ryan's Buffet. And when you first set at table they would have these really warm buttery salty rolls for an appetizer. They would try to fill you up on roll before you went up and got food but this place would serve like everyday American homemade food. And it would be random stuff that I would get slices of pizza red beans and rice. Fish. French fries. I think they had a hamburgers. Salisbury steak probably. Chicken nuggets. Corn on the cob. Roast. Mashed potatoes macaroni any type of vegetable that you wanted and a ton of other stuff I just can't think of it at the moment. Ham. Chicken. And then for dessert I would get like strawberries yogurt and then a bunch of toppings cookies. I love going to this place. Unfortunately Ryan's Buffet all over the south is actually closed and shut down it was really old and run-down hopefully they bring it back one day. It's a lot like Golden Corral. But a lot different. I even celebrated my 10th birthday there. It would sing to you and everything.

   Have you ever loved someone you have not met?
  ","
  For the first 6 months me and Jason were together we never actually fully met each other in real life. Tho we knew absolutely everything about each other and facetimed and knew everything about each other's family's, I definitely think it's possible for you to love someone that you've never truly face to face. There's is just certain ways that you have to go about it. You have to be very careful. Have more than one person talking to this person also. When you see everybody seeming the same vibe from the person, then that is a good sign. Everybody loves Jason. When I met him, it felt like I had already met him before. Because we knew everything about each other. We had facetimed so much that we were used to it. 6 years down the line we're married and love one another and are there for each other. I wouldn't ask for a better man! He is the best!

   What problems did you have in school ??
  ","
  The phrase danged if you do and danged if you don't. No matter if I did things that people asked me to or not I still got yelled at or made fun of for it. Basically if I was not social enough I got made fun of for it. If I was to social than I got made fun of for it. No matter what you do you don't please people.
  
  Another thing I had trouble with his school was trying to take test. I was good at taking tests when it was quiet and quiet only. But as soon as everyone was done with their test then they start to talk and I couldn't concentrate. ? I never understood that... I was quiet when they took a test? ....so how come when I'm done with my test, I am quiet but when they're done testing and I am still testing, they decide to talk?.. :( Why can't they be quiet for me as I am for them? I even ask the teacher to tell them to be quiet and they don't listen and then they make fun of me for it. I really cannot concentrate when people are talking. So a lot of times, I wasn't able to finish the tests and I would have to wait until my free time to finish it. I found that unfair because people should just be quiet. Selfishness.

  I think I've been to all but a strip club and a dance review.

  The only reason I haven't been to all of them is because one I don't know what a dance review is and I don't go to strip clubs because a lot of them around where I have lived have not been really safe.

   The top has pretty baby  written on it.  I am improving with nailpaint. Nice shade ??
  ","
  Yeah I thought the top was really cute. And yes you doing really good with the nail painting. And the color is cute. You should do purple next time! That would be really cute or maybe both! One finger pink and the other purple. Like every other finger a different color!
  
  If you mess up with your finger get you a little bit of toilet paper and some hydrogen peroxide and just wipe around your finger and skin. Or use Q-tips. This is what I have to do when I paint my nails. No one's perfect. Even the professionals do this. Don't wipe the whole nail off just clean your skin around where you messed up so bad. You got this! I believe in you! Happy New Year's to you and your family and friends by the way!

So I completely understand if it takes you a minute to answer them. Whether it's because you're not active or it's the same reason to why I can't answer all mine. You have so many is what I mean. So don't be upset with me if I don't answer y'alls as well. Like on time. Like it could be a month before I answer them. It's sad. I have so many in my inbox.

  What was the good things?
  
  Umm... me and my husband's first full year being married. It went well. Getting to go to Louisiana and see my family. Not a lot of good stuff that happened this year honestly. But I'm not going to say it was all bad because it wasn't. It was definitely a rough year this year. I lost a lot of family members and friends. We have a roommate that literally ruined every single holiday and drinks and smokes and is mean to all of us. We kind of just want to live on our own but can't right now. We can't make her leave... But yeah.. there were some positive. Good moments with family and friends.

I'm a nice person and give people the opportunity to talk to me on other social medias and some of y'all choose to step into my comfort zone. ? I appreciate any and every compliment.. But like when I say. NO INAPPROPRIATE STUFF. Like.. I am for real about it? I am not joking in any way, shape or  forum... ? Like. I just don't know what it is gonna take. Y'all just don't care. Idfg where your from.. You know what I said and what I meant. Now sadly I have to be this way.. Should have listened.. People just can't listen.... It's sad.

   What does the word “Morals” mean to you?
  ","
  Moral to meis the lesson of a story. Also meaninggood, or ethical. If you have a ""strong moral character,"" you are a good member of society. If someone is a cheat and a liar, you might say, "" he/she is not a moral person."" Or someone that is very disrespectful. Doesn't use everyday logic. Isn't realistic about the things that they said do. Don't think before they do something. People that just think life is a game... are unmoral like people.
  
  Then theirare the principles we follow that help us know the difference between right and wrong. When someoneis immoral, they make decisions that purposely violate a moral agreement. Immoral is sometimes confused with amoral, which describes someonewho has no morals and doesn't know what right or wrong means.
  
  Yeah. That's what is means to me.

  Doing any type of drugs or house is not clean decently and they don't take regular baths and just doing the everyday essentials. If you can't take care of yourself then how are you supposed to take care of someone else or expect it from someone else.
  
  Morals and respect. If someone does not want to do something then you should be okay with it, not guilt them into it and make them feel like they are a bad person for not wanting to do that. Peer pressure is not a choice.

  Sometimes there's something going on in your life that you need to x out and then later on you find out that that was the reason why you were having so much stress. Sometimes you have to seek professional help. Such as anxiety medicine. It can help.

  I'm just going to lose some of my favorite bands.
  
  Skillet is amazing. I definitely I think you should look up at least 10 or songs and listen to them. I think that you would probably like a few. If you would like to know if you songs that are really good by then let me know and I will list them.
  
  PVRIS is really good. Their old music is very very good. Their new music is a little dark but is good. I do not recommend for really young people. Paranormal like music.
  
  Evanescence is really good. I'm sure you've heard their music.
  
  Flyleaf is good. If you would like me to lose some songs out let me know.
  
  While growing up Avril Lavigne was my idol. My most favorite singer of all time. My favorite music by her is her old albums under my skin and let go. Every single one of those songs on those albums are amazing. For over two decades I have loved her. I recommend her to you. And her old music.
  
  Paramore. I'm sure you have heard of them. Their first two albums are amazing as their albums have gotten newer their music has changed but it's still good.
  
  Against the current. A good YouTube group that makes really nice covers. They also have their own band now and are doing very well. They sound good.
  
  Seether
  
  Breaking Benjamin
  
  Linkin Park
  
  Creed, if you would like me to tell you a few songs by them let me know. But they are very good.
  
  Avenged Sevenfold
  
  Papa Roach
  
  9 Finger Death Punch
  
  Jumpsuit Apparatus
  
  This is a little swerving off of the music topic but I really like Becky G she has really good Latina music and English music. I like Ariana Grande. Zara Larsson. Ryan Upchurch and Katie Noel. Front of church is country rap and so is Katie Noel. Zara Larsson makes really good music. I think you would like it. Sassy and sweet music. Obviously you've heard of Ariana Grande. A lot of people don't like her music and there's a lot of people that do. I like it for its sassiness.
  
  I love country music so anyting country I like. Country rock. R&B. Metal and gospel metal. Rock. Pop. And more
