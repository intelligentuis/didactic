   Here's a tip for TTC if you already haven't done it. Get a period tracker app, I use ""my tracker"". It tracks your entire cycle, and not only your ovulation day, but your most (and least) fertile WEEK to ttc. It's pretty simple, hope you consider it. Best of luck on having your third baby ✨

   Mulatto (from Spanish mulato, small mule) is a word referring to a person who is born to one Black parent and one Caucasian parent. The term may be considered offensive or rude to some, because of its origin. The term is also used to refer to a light brown color, because of a mulatto's skin color.
  ","
  mulatto isn’t an offensive term .
  
  it’s literally a color .
  
  so many mixed tone females refer to themselves as mulatto

   It’s usually seen as “nasty,” because it’s an admission of guilt, or worse you’re scared that you do have an STD. But, I agree with you, it’s a way of staying healthy.  You never know who’s lying to you.
