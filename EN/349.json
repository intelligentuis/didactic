victoria person was someone else who made a new account as a disguise . got a couple people in mind but it s cool . don t show your face i guess aha . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?","323520":"oh this is a fun question . lol . i m usually in the mood to make cinnamon pancakes with brown sugar in the batter and it s actually so good . topped with strawberries and whipped cream along with cinnamon cream syrup , house potatoes fried potatoes eggs over easy or scrambled depends on my mood , and i hardly ever eat meat so . . . . if you want bacon or sausage you gotta make it urself ? ? ? but i hope you like everything else .","323521":"thanks for the love !","323522":"bruh i stg people can be so ignorant sometimes . there is nothing wrong with knowing you re attractive . yes i am attractive , and i know that . but that doesn t mean i m full of myself . i m just confident as hell . i know who i am and i know my heart . don t look at someone s pics and see they re attractive and automatically think they re full of themselves when you ve never spoken to them in person . in person , i m really sweet and kind and can be shy at times . anyone who s met me in person can tell you that . but i m not perfect because i am human , and when people cross certain boundaries i m not longer nice because i love myself enough to not anyone step over me . so to anyone out there who s experienced the same thing , just know that people are gonna think whatever they wanna think . all that matters is that you know and love yourself regardless of what anyone else has to say .","323523":"psa don t beg me
