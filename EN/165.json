necessarily have a favorite","153416":"it s how they re written","153417":"haven t had one here in forever but when i was little we used to make blanket forts and shadow puppets with flashlights and read books and play with our animal figurines","153418":"thanks here s a pic of the ugliest horse i ve ever loved for ya his name was roscoe and he was my first ever lease horse . they rescued him from the racetrack and i really took to him like , immediately . his owners sold him after i trained him for a while when i was in my early teens . wish i could ve bought him but it wasn t in the cards for me unfortunately","153419":"they re v cute babies i appreciate them a lot and they re good companions lol . my first word was actually dog and i ve always had a love for them but my fave animal has to be a horse lol . not sure if i prefer one over the other as far as company or friendship but dogs sure are more convenient and easy to care for haha","153420":"the bay pony named max the dark brown one with the dark brown mane and tail that i sometimes post about is probably worthless . maybe a few hundred dollars at best . he s elderly with a few health problems and doesn t know much as far as actual training is concerned . he came from a bad abuse situation so he s mistrustful and takes an experienced person to handle him sometimes . the grey horse in my profile pic , that s chance , is probably worth like dollars in his current condition and at his current age . he s also considered an elderly horse now since he s . horses usually live to be about years old . a nice horse that s in good health , not super old , and has solid training for riding can cost anywhere from around , to literal hundreds of thousands of dollars . it all depends on how much they know their training , their overall physical health , their bloodlines , and their conformation their body build .","153421":"now it s raining but it was snowing earlier !","153422":"unfortunately they don t know when to stop and they ll eat until their stomach ruptures . it s only a problem bc horses can t throw up like people or dogs and cats","153423":"not like the giant ones like in the olympics but i ve done ones like this . standing next to it that jump probably came up to my collar bone . it was about feet , maybe","153424":"the two i most frequently get to train are just trail horses who don t know how to jump over stuff with a rider on their backs although jumping is my absolute fav thing to do with the horses !","153425":"personally don t own any as of now , but i m lucky enough to be able to work with pretty frequently ! plus i also get to see some others on the side when i visit other horse friends who let me work with their s","153426":"gotta find your own true meaning it s neither fair nor unfair lol it s an individual thing for each person","153427":"very neat ! guess you don t get snow frequently lol","153428":"something you have to figure out for yourself","153429":"east coast us , hbu ?","153430":"depends but most of the time i have to figure stuff out on my own","153431":"know when to say no and walk away . you can t help someone who doesn t

make him look bad he could technically press charges","153502":"nope . never really interested me","153503":"brussel sprouts","153504":"not with chance or max lol . they re more trail horses than show horses . i don t think they know enough to even enter a competition haha we d probably lose . i used to compete a lot but it was with all my old trainers and their horses . rn i don t really even have a trainer cause i can t afford it but it s cool , i don t really mind . showing wasn t my all time favorite thing , it was always just something neat to do on the side

success of the website for sure","153515":"sure why not haha . i don t think any future anyone could predict would be true , but maybe they could predict a possible future that would depend on someone making all the right decisions to get there","153516":"true ! no idea then . maybe someone is getting the big bucks but unfortunately that person isn t me lol","153517":"i don t think anyone gets paid to use this app . that d be nice tho","153518":"i just told you lol your account gets more popular cause their algorithm apparently shows your answers to more people and more people follow you and stuff . i mean i guess there s no point really bc this whole app is pretty pointless lol but yeah you just get more coins and stuff every week if you fulfill your vip task list thing","153519":"if you re a vip or regular vip user you re supposed to send shoutouts a week to maintain your status . your account gets view boosts and you earn extra coins when you achieve your weekly goal","153520":"money","153521":"when people send space i ve come to realize they mean a space to say whatever you want probs cause they need to fill their shoutout quota and it s easy lol","153522":"https youtu . be kgit j n k","153523":"just taking care of horses and riding every so often is the best workout plan routine for me","153524":"it s ok but i m looking through old photos

bites the dust !","153533":"days","153534":"don t really have any","153535":"no more crazy than gamers , otakus , or eccentric artists . maybe people think equestrians are crazy because any time women in general get excited or passionate about something , people are quick to stigmatize it and point out that it s crazy or dumb . nobody says that gamers are crazy for obsessing over cod or halo games . nobody labels people who collect merchandise from their favorite anime show as crazy . nobody really stigmatizes any of that as crazy particularly because on the whole it s men who tend to enjoy those activities and they have historically been much more of a male centric market . any time a female dominated activity , sport , or pastime , has become popular , people label people who like it as crazy . there are some individuals in every fandom , activity , or sport that make a bad name for the rest of everyone else , but tbh it s silly to blanket statement anything and say people who do or are or people who like are crazy .","153536":"my bf once told me that he genuinely thinks a good , kind , woman has the power to help make any man nicer and better . love is powerful but the man himself also has to want to be better , more trusting , and nicer for himself , otherwise he ll stay calloused and bitter his whole life and never know the freedom of true happiness , love , and trust . those weren t his actual words , but it made sense to me lol","153537":"it s fine , seems like a nice name too lol . i feel neutrally about it","153538":"yeah and it sucks but that doesn t mean you should never ever be nice or let your guard down or invest in anyone ever again . that s miserable and a crappy feeling and it s no way to live","153539":"i m not comfortable giving out personal info about him without his permission cause idk what he wants out there on the internet haha but all i m saying is the world isn t all as hard as hood is if you don t make it . not everyone is out to get you or whatever and it s not that hard just to be nice with people and be cool","153540":"like those black jackets for english shows ? haha yeah i have one of those ! this is me summers ago at a horse show with my old trainer s horse nugget","153541":"it s a nice name . i don t know anyone named michelle anymore but i used to before we moved lol","153542":"my parents were both in the navy so i m pretty over the whole military thing lol","153543":"sounds the same as my bf . he s also a baby faced , blue eyed , white dude who grew up in the hood . from what he s told me , instead of mean mugging and trying to establish dominance over people , he just befriended everyone and was cool with people and made them laugh so nobody robbed him or fucked with him cause they were all cool . he essentially chose happiness and developing social skills over cynicism and misery . doesn t seem impossible","153544":"nah","153545":"there s a difference between being nice to people and not knowing how to say no stand up for yourself and let people walk all over you . it s difficult and some people never really get the hang of it but it s an essential life skill to have if someone is going to be happy and mentally healthy","153546":"my bf , dog , a successful and well maintained equestrian facility with well trained and gentle horses in it i could have for giving riding lessons , a new house on a hill with a lovely moss garden , a vegetable garden , some fruit trees , and a a tiny hobby farm with some cottages on the side i could use as air b b s or farm stay cottages","153547":"haha uh
