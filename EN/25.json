Hopefully your immune system is strong enough to fight it off because that's the point of the shot. It's inject you with a little bit of the virus and see if your body can fight it off and not all the time everybody can fight it off. They say that the shot doesn't get you sick but in my opinion sorry if you weren't sick with it at all and then you get the shot and then it gets you sick a week later then that is the shot getting you sick.

Don't automatically think that this is what it is but I would definitely start asking your boyfriend when he discusses with his best friend about you because at the end of the day I don't think it's appropriate for his best friend to be being nasty to you especially if you're with someone especially his best friend.

You would be surprised a lot of my co-workers and people that come in are good friends of mine. So spending it at home would be really sad.

This covid-19 stuff has really messed up everything but I guess we have to do what we have to do you know? But today did go well. It went better than I thought. We went antique shopping. And went to a few flea markets. And then we went out to eat at my favorite restaurant and I ordered the lobster and scallop and shrimp plate. So it was really good and I was spoiled today. My husband got me quite a bit of things including a really old antique beautiful jewelry box that sings when you open a chat. And this beautiful All-American purse and other gifts. I'm going to put my most special things in there that he got me. It's beautiful and I love it it is sentimental now in my life. Today definitely has went well. Got to ride around also.

We're consuming different types of oils that have diffused into the water bottle over time especially from different temperatures and just from its sitting that's why water has an expiration sometimes because after it has been sitting in the plastic for so long it actually becomes ruined and not drinkable.

When you do go to drink that water you will notice it has a foul taste to it and then it almost tastes dirty. That is because the water has now diffused some of the water bottle into it and you're not drinking different types of plastic and oil and stuff. Not good for you not good for your body.

Yes we all have it and even some times often.. But just a friendly tell here. You don't have to follow the advice. No. But you should really work on not having it too* much. Too much of either isn't even close to healthy. People won't want to be around you if you show toooo much. Be creative yourself & love the things you are & do & not others so much. Do your own thing. Discover your talents and skills and show them off. Your not going to be the best at EVERYTHING. That is near to impossible. Have full confidence and determination in anything and everything you do. It's okay to get ideas from other people but don't always show that you're completely jealous of everything they have and do. Then it's just gonna kill your self-esteem and kill for everyone... Or don't envy everything they have and do. Especially all of the time like I said. But like I said you don't have to follow this advice. This is just a friendly thought. I know quite a few envious and jealous people and to be honest I never really see them around a lot of friends. And these are extremely jealous and envious people. People just don't want to be around them. I mean if that's what they want then so be it but why would you want no one to be around you? No one like you? Why? If so.

Christmas just seems peaceful to me so I try my best to make it seem as relaxing and peaceful. This time of the year Christmas. Plus my birthday is around this time of the year and more.

My body is definitely not made for donating blood. I listen to all of the instructions on how to get ready to donate and still it didn't help.

Today was the first time I walked them all together. 3. All 3. We just rescued a baby and it was her first time walking with the big dogs so it was pretty cool and remembering. We had fun she did really good on the leash. We're trying to train her how to walk on a leash. We also have a harness on her so she's learning how to have her harness on.

Surgeries that are going to keep them alive.\n  \n  Just donating your blood can really help the world. Try to donate your blood every two or three months. Especially plasma.ii\n  \n  Bushfire Charities I like to give to because you would be surprised how many bushfires they have throughout the year and multiple different parts of the world. You can donate to certain areas of the world also.\n  \n  I like to give to just vet's. Try to go and give money to vets or really shelters more or less. Because they want to save so many more animals than what they can't. So many animals have to get euthanized because people don't have the money to take care of him and there's just so many and some of them are mean and we want to try to avoid that. Try to give people a chance to give an animal a second chance.\n  \n  And then maybe... Try to give to poor families that are struggling. Sometimes people like that sign up for certain programs. Like one-parent families. Like girls or guys that have three or four children and they're raising them on their own or even more five or six children.\n  \n  Orphanages. It's really good to donate mostly items to orphanages but they love money to to help feed and take care of the kids and get them new beds and blankets and stuff like that.\n  \n  There are just so many. If you ever need any more suggestions just let me know.\n  \n  Giving is good.\n  ","27760":"\n  Followed you back.

I think my husband graduated two or three years ahead of me. But yeah I never really dated people in high school because a lot of the people that I went to school with were not the best kids. A lot of them hung out with people that did drugs or they did drugs. Plus I wanted to focus on Sports and school. I didn't actually start dating people truly until junior year and that's when I met my husband. I almost went into the military but instead when I met him I decided not to because I saw a future with him eight years later we're still together and married\n  ","27777":"\n  Ayyye \u270c\n  ","27778":"\n  I just may.
