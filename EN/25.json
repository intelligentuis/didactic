spread ? i say . . what is so wrong about me missing things ? and wanting it to all be back the same . though it s never going to happen . we cannot sit here for to years waiting for this stuff to go

cause i already know this . . that it s not going away but literally this sickness stuff has got people scared and hiding in their houses and not even coming out to see daylight . it has got people literally working from home eating from home and not doing anything and having people deliver their groceries and everything . i haven t seen one of my family members and almost an entire year because they are terrified to come out of their house now because they have now scared them to death . i think that is completely and utterly ridiculous on every extent . b c they literally are terrified . it

the house to get a few things and some food together to go to a mardi gras parade . i would probably go pick up some friends and we would get some chairs and tables and we would set them up before the parade and we would just enjoy some good music and just sit around and conversate a little bit . maybe buy some really cool merchandise from the trailer that ride around for mardi gras . they sell many different types of merchandise that you can wear at the parades and go home with . sometimes we ll play different types of games and will play with the kids and throw footballs and baseballs . sometimes will even set up in the middle of the road and actual baseball game until the parade start . usually will start lining up and waiting for parade even almost hours at a time or longer . just to celebrate . we eat really good food and have a great time . and catch awesome stuff . after the parade would probably go home and look at the things that we got wash up and get ready to go and watch movies in the living room and probably bake cookies at the end of the day . and in the day in the best way you can after a wonderful mardi gras celebration .","23180":"my scare was pretty tough

earth southern homemade type foods . usually they have a lot of flavor to them . a lot of color to the food . the food can be slightly spicy but it s never super hot . most of the time you add extra spices to your own bowl . not to the main pot . but basically cajun food just has tons of flavor . it s really really good food . i grew up around cajun culture and they just have some of the best food ever . a lot of it isn t the most healthiest for you so most of the time a lot of it you have to have on occasion . but red beans and rice is really good for you . it s got beans in it it s got sausage in it it s got ham in it lots of spices . mild spices not hot hot spices . the cornbread just a really buttery sweet cornbread and then the cheesy cornbread is just a slightly sweet cornbread with cheese and a little spice to it . and then the potato salad is just a simple potato , eggs , little mayonnaise , very little mustard , sprinkle of salt and pepper and parsley . nothing too extravagant or strange . just your everyday potato salad . and if you like relish in yours you can add a teaspoon of relish . i m not too much of a fan of vinegar in my potato salad . if y all eat

matter of time . you don t want to sit there for hours . if you re going to sit there for hours then you need to be there and preparing early so when your guests get there they don t have to wait more

miss more classes and have to catch up on more classes and more classes and more work and tests so that s why i never like to miss school . unless i was really sick or had a death in the family . or

sometimes when things go bad it doesn t mean they re immediately bad that day it just means that the stores that they are in can t sell them at that date anymore . some things really are bad when they go bad like some cut fruit . i wouldn t trust baby food because considering you re giving it to an incident . but if you get like sour cream ? sour cream takes a while to go bad even when it reaches its expiration date . chips are pretty decent until you open them . even after expiration . not all chips though . milk can sometimes be fine even at its expiration and sometimes you can even go bad days before its expiration . you just have to be careful . jugs of tea usually don t go bad on their expiration date . everything has to have an expiration date or at least almost everything especially when a store is selling the item . it s insured that the item is safe for the customer to consume or be around . if not then you cannot sell it .","23352":"i try my best to be as nice as i

way . using the words , of course , to answered this more along the lines of just being very excited , happy and eager because i love questions like this . the number questions . i just wanted to answer it positive . so i said of course . saying many times and that i loved it . don t take the things i say out of context because most of the time i m only answering it in a really excited and happy way and that s the only thing i am getting out of it . it s not me being rude what s so ever or in any form .","23354":"only always . it is impossible to keep up with emails i feel","23355":"i

memories . the scenery and landscaping is wonderful . especially when you take the back roads instead of taking the everyday highways you get to see all kinds of different types of landscaping and scenery . the tourist attractions of course who doesn t like them right ? and then the experience with our pitties . we have three pitbulls now . a little newborn puppy and then we have old dixie she s about and we have g he s about mid age and . and we take them everywhere with us because that s just what we love to do with them . g s a water dog so he loves the beach and dixie loves people and she loves to be loved . so taking our dogs definitely amps of the experience . so that s probably my most favorite part about traveling is the unexpected and the spontaneous moments that happen","23447":"haha you re completely fine . i love original questions . when i send out questions i try my very best to be different rare and original with my questions also . plus cuz i sent it so

giant section was on water . types of water . and the sources on where you get the water . you d be surprised where some water comes from . someone is from aquifers under the ground . some water is pretty much just unfiltered dirty water that has aka nutrients in them . some water is super duper purified and some of it is just partially purified and they just slap a label on it to try and get people to buy it . and especially that wire that is purified where do they get it ? you need to go and look up the section yourself and find out yourself . it is appalling to find out where they get their water from sometimes . considering nobody really owns some of the water lands in certain places . there s a hint . pretty much everyone for themselves . and just hope they don t use all the water . pump it all . and then some water has salt in it . a lot . and then other places also . this is just a few . i literally took a class on this . water is water but it just depends on where you get it and then what is done with it after .","23715":"thanks ! same back to you ! everything is going wonderful ! hope everything s going okay for you as well ! thanks for asking by the way

other entities can be harmful . all the researches i ve done on ouija boards . most of the time people don t play them correctly and bad things come from them . you really have to be aware and careful when using ouija boards . i have years and years of research and practice in learning how to use a ouija board properly . i have explained to people so many times how to use them . properly . and why they shouldn t use . the do s and the don ts . but there s so many different things about the paranormal world that are complicated that i m not going to get into because there s so many different branches and such a long conversation that i would be here for hours explaining it . my years of experience and researching . i would actually just have to be face to face with a person to show them how much information i have . it s pretty cool","23797":"and that s basically the same thing i just stated above . that s the same way i look at it . everybody has their own pass that they choose to take in life .","23798":"yes i have felt this way but the same time you still need to find that way to make yourself happy also . because all people deserve happiness","23799":"good for them . if that

not much of a country girl though i do live out in the country and a lot of people probably would call me that i m more of a cajun girl so wearing a cowgirl hat but just not look right on me to be honest with you . i don t want to feel like that everyday want to be cowgirl so that s why i don t try to stick to that type of dial . i m more of a biker tomboy kind of girl . along the lines of type of dress wear","23807":"honestly as long as you re the age i don t think it really matters as long as you know for sure that you re ready to get married that person , both of you . it s a really important commitment . it s really hard to get out of a marriage than it is to get into a marriage . buy paper is what i mean . so don t just jump into a relationship and not even wait a couple weeks and then get married . i would probably wait a good couple months at least and get to know the person and their family and how they are and how they live . and just know for sure that you want to be with that person . as long as both of you know for sure that you are ready to get married then i don t see a problem in it . like i said the legal age of course . me and jason knew for sure that we were ready to get married when we were only a year and a half maybe together . but we waited till four years because one money to we just wanted to make sure that we were ready but we were . but we did the right thing i think . plus there were tons of obstacles and distance in between us . so it was a little hard for us to get married . we wanted to make sure we were together when we got married . physically in person together . we were in a long distance relationship for and years before we permanently we re together and living together . i never regret marrying jason . he is wonderful and i love him very much . but of course not every relationship works like me and my husband s did . you really need to make sure that you are ready to be with a person . it s an extremely important decision to make in life . and if you want to leave leave . don t stick around and let them control you .","23808":"thanks ! i appreciate the compliment . at one point i didn t believe in it neither . just at one point in my life i witnessed to certain things and that s what made me believe . just certain events and things that i have witnessed made me believe . some people laugh at it . some people don t believe in it . but that s just because they re skeptics and they have seen it firsthand . and that s okay . i have been interested and curious about the paranormal as young as the age of eight years old . and i have been working in the field since i was around that age also . so it s been a long time since i have been researching the topic . so yeah .","23809":"haha road trips are the

homelessness . once they see that you re homeless they don t want you because they don t see that you re clean they don t see that you re this they don t see that you re that but the thing about it is is the fact that you re even trying to come up there and get a job when it s so hard to get the courage because it s embarrassing to be homeless . to be able to have the courage to go up there and actually try to get a job regardless of what it is and how much it is is the bravest thing you could do and it is a good thing . as long as they re in there trying and they look like they re trying and you see their story maybe try helping them out and really seeing the real person behind the homelessness ? starting on homeless with no money whatsoever is hard especially if you ve been homeless for a while . they could have no type of proper clothes for working or maybe even no shoes . maybe buy them a pair of shoes . or maybe two or three pairs of socks . or maybe buy them a pair of khaki pants . honestly they could be an extremely intelligent person , something just happened . things happen . family members died or something . . . maybe they re handling something in life really hard . people get addictions and then they overcome them . . . some don t . . . sadly but they still are homeless . many things can happen . they could get sick . they could be even a veteran . . . people just want to judge . they never want to look at the big picture or put themselves in someone s shoes . but when they they re homeless they re crying and they re sobbing just like that person was that they were making fun of . now they will really see what it s like once they get into the situation and then when they get mad when people make fun of them but they were the ones that were making fun of someone else once . then they will realize but they did was messed up and they should have never did it . karma is horrible .","23878":"my costume was very simple and comfortable because it was

was young and talented and that s what happened . fame and money . but in the song and i m going to post below is his real thoughts on it . even though you have all that thing in money does it mean that you re happy it really means that you re really lonely . people aren t going to listen and people aren t going to be there for you as properly as you think they would . but this song right here . i have been here since day one . i have always been a fan of him . a huge fan of his actions ? no . just because he was really young and around the same age as me when i found out that he got famous at the same age . i know for sure he wishes he could go back though he doesn t take any of the fame and love for granted though i think he really doesn t miss his old life . a life without judgment . a life without criticism . if you have been here since day one for him you will understand this video . if you haven t put yourself into his shoes . what would you do if you were years old and a kid and got famous ? yeah . there . look at that . https youtu . be xqoo xgq pc","23946":"just things thay people say and how they say it . . . just like . . don t say it bro . . ugh .","23947":"i am .

just love the rain . i love to hear thunder . it s just something different with the day . adds character . lately we haven t really been getting a lot of rain which is sad but it s okay . we re about to get another hurricane down here . but you would be surprised how to some people how much the rain means to them . some people are not able to see the sky and rain like we are able to . and they

trying to mame it and hurt it when not even realizing that it s someone s loved pet and it actually happens to be a little girl s pet . horrible . all they had to do was come over and tell the neighbor that their dog was in their yard messing with their livestock . chickens that maybe cost . to a dollar that were bought . they re going to slaughter the chickens . they re not even that important . but let s kill a expensive loved animal that is a little girls dog because you are a evil person . i never understood how people work . now there are thousands of little pellets in this dog s body and they are going to have to take each and every one of them out of him . he is literally the sweetest dog in the world and it never hurt a fly . all he wanted to do is play with the chickens . and of course we have people like this in the world that can t physically walk themselves over and verbally speak about the manor . even maybe call the police ? but have to shoot the animal
