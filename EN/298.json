. they were literally the best dogs ever with the most unique personalities . the golden retriever was literally dug from the movie up , and the cockapoo was the alpha male even though he was th the size of the golden . lmaoo .","275651":"yeah , i still remember the feeling of walking into the house after work or school , for example , and not being used to the overwhelming quiet . like , no barking or her running across the floor to the front door , it was weird . now that i ve been living with cats for almost a year , i can t imagine being in a house without pets , you know ?","275652":"lol . she was the sweetest , but she came from a neglectful household prior to us adopting her . i felt so bad she was afraid of men especially , and she didn t like black shoes or garbage bags . she was very skittish and was only really comfortable around me or my brother . we gave her a good life though prior to her passing , she ended up having a big tumor in her belly that was cancerous , which apparently can be common in german shepherds . my parents didn t want to get another dog after she died because of how heartbreaking it was , so i only had fish from that point forward , lol .","275653":"celinem this was my dog , i don t remember how old she was in this photo , but you can definitely see the german shepherd in her .","275654":"i don t remember what was on my

my therapist reminds me of this and it does make me somewhat proud of myself for the amount of progress i ve made over the past years . my mental health used to be a lot worse than it is now ,

out to dinner last night , for example , and the restaurant only allowed one third of its regular patrons for seating , everyone had to wear masks unless they were seated at their table , there were no physical menus , etc etc . i was a bit nervous to go out , but i felt fine overall . it felt nice to be able to eat and drink out for the first time in five months , lol .","275667":"no , i m too

.","275751":"i ve been known to cut corners every now and again .","275752":"i can be at times , especially if someone else is involved and i need to make a decision with them . i always want to make sure that they re okay with whatever i m suggesting , and even if they say yes , i still question myself , haha .","275753":"none of my birthdays have been overly spectacular , haha . nothing comes to

distance in stores , and there are restrictions for bars and restaurants .","275767":"it s basically the same in the us , but the cases vary depending on where you live . where i live , numbers are going down , but down south , it s increasing dramatically . however , i agree with you people are acting like things are back to normal , when they re not . they re going out and partying in large groups of people , not wearing masks , not distancing , etc etc . that s why the cases keep rising , people just don t want to listen because they re fed up with being quarantined .","275768":"that s not normal , no . work should be professional , and even if you think someone is attractive , that doesn t mean you should act on it or make things weird .","275769":"i m so excited for autumn , just

only way you can move is forward . sometimes it doesn t serve you to dwell on what has happened , especially if there s nothing you can do to change it , because you re only going to further spiral down . not trusting people is pretty normal , especially after what you ve been through . you just have to let your emotions run their course and continue looking forward .","275776":"cont . . . you know what i mean ? like i know my psychiatrist will definitely say i m overthinking but i know i m not . not everything needs evidence because i only feel this way towards her . just her . i understand how you feel . like i said before , sometimes you need to trust your gut instinct . although i would also bring this up to your psychiatrist and see what they have to say about it .","275777":"i was devastated and i still am . linkin park was such an instrumental part of my teenage years , and to this day they re my favorite band .","275778":"dating and being in a relationship

really go on ask unless i have free time , haha . sometimes i go on during work but when it s listening to a client s call where what they re talking about is irrelevant to the interview questions .","275790":"life sucks , and then you die .","275791":"that s what i thought too , but who even knows . i do experience hypomanic episodes not full blown mania , but that s a symptom of both bpd and bipolar disorder . idk , i was talking to a friend about it and they said that i have to go off of the thinking that my therapist doesn t know enough about me yet to make that determination . my therapist said that she didn t think i had a personality disorder during our third only session .","275792":"i ve never seen one before , so i don t really know .","275793":"i understand that completely , trust me . even with therapy and medication , i still get super bothered by the smallest of details and think them over a million times , which ends up upsetting me even more . i do have to say though . . . i m not sure if my bpd diagnosis was valid , or if it was a misdiagnosis . my first psychiatrist treated me for bpd , but my second psychiatrist who didn t have my medical records almost seemed offended when i told her i was diagnosed with it , and now my current therapist whom i ve only seen three times says she doesn t think i have a personality disorder . it s just making me super confused , so i m not sure what to even think anymore . i almost . . . connected with my bpd diagnosis after being diagnosed , and now that it s in question , i m super lost and confused . if it isn t bpd , then what is it ? i don t have just depression and anxiety , and i need to talk to my therapist more about this next week because i feel like a fraud .","275794":"serotonin and dopamine .","275795":"i ve been taught some coping mechanisms , but granted i don t really use them very much , lmaoo . however , some things my previous therapist taught me deep breathing exercises . inhale for six seconds , exhale for six seconds , and repeat three times . it helps sometimes if you close your eyes , and especially if you relax your body if you can . be mindful of the present moment . point out to yourself things that you can see , feel , smell , etc etc . , in that moment . it s a grounding technique . vent to a friend and have them validate your concerns if possible . it s all right to reach out if you need it . it s helpful to talk to someone who can tell you that you re not being irrational and that your feelings are valid , and that usually does help me calm down a bit too .","275796":"no , i never have .","275797":"i don t answer inappropriate sexual questions , y all should know that by now .","275798":"i m not sure if you can really compare the two , tbh . it depends entirely on the person s job and their qualifications .","275799":"i m against the porn industry , so no .","275800":"depends on the store , but it honestly sounds like a cop out just so that the company doesn t have to pay the part timers benefits .","275801":"yeah , i identified as pansexual for a brief period of time . i realized that i ve just always related to bisexual more , even though my attractions themselves haven t changed .","275802":"lucifer .","275803":"if that was the case , then i d just bathe in my own blood .","275804":"oh jesus , hahah . use your imagination . i

.","275810":"yeah , i ve always been interested in seeing castles in the uk .","275811":"i don t know what either of those are .","275812":"my ex and i somewhat lived together for a short period of time years ago . i basically stayed at his house with a backpack of clothing nights per week and then stayed at my parents house for the rest of the week .","275813":"yes , i said in my answer that i dated a girl .","275814":"my favorite colors are blood red and black .","275815":"my tank top is blue .","275816":"my first girlfriend broke up with me because she realized she was straight . my first boyfriend was an adult and grooming me , and i thankfully ended it before it escalated . my second boyfriend and i dated for many years and we simply grew apart from one another , so the breakup was mutual .","275817":"jean shorts and a tank top . i can see where this is going , so that s all of the information you re going to get .","275818":"i ve dated three people in the past .","275819":"for the most part , i avoid conflict but not necessarily at any cost . i can be confrontational at times .","275820":"hello do you have a question ?","275821":"no , i m currently single .","275822":"anything that isn t inappropriate or invasive .","275823":"obviously not , the fuck . lmaoo .","275824":"no . i m not interested in talking to other people outside of askfm . that being said , askfm is for questions not conversation . so unless you have a legitimate question , i won t be responding to these anymore .","275825":"i don t have any enemies besides myself lol .","275826":"at least thousands .","275827":"obviously my friends follow me on instagram , lol . i have no interest in talking to strangers online .","275828":"yes , i m single .","275829":"my instagram is private no exceptions . i don t accept requests from strangers and i don t answer dms .","275830":"because your perception of me differs from reality .","275831":"you can t , lol

theirs .","275840":"my roommate once made stuffed peppers with ground beef , onions , rice , and cheese so good .","275841":"i just finished up with work now i m laying down .","275842":"oh shoot , that s awesome ! ! i ve also smoked out of those mini bowls i guess that s what anon was talking about , where you can only take one hit off of the entire thing . these days , i just smoke the pens .","275843":"you mean a bowl ? lol , yeah .","275844":"definitely not .","275845":"idk , but i honestly do think he has some underlying neurological issues because sometimes his sentences don t make any sense . obviously i can t armchair diagnose someone since i know nothing about medicine , but i just feel like something is . . . off .","275846":"thank you","275847":"i just smoke weed on

tik tok so i don t know much about the culture surrounding it . my roommate shows me tik tok videos from time to time , and the ones he finds are hilarious .","275861":"as my bio indicates , i m years

addressing the tik toks , now that i think about it . i think honestly it would have happened regardless of which social media site it is , whether it s tik tok or instagram or twitter or whichever . that doesn t necessarily mean tik tok should be banned , though . in that vein of thinking , askfm should be banned as well because of the intense cyber bullying that happens here too . it s pretty inescapable regardless of which app you re using .","275868":"it s supposed to storm where i live today , so this is perfect timing ! ! if i m not working , then i usually like having ambient lights on and watching television a movie or playing video games with the sounds of the rain and storm in the background .","275869":"i m really trying to , but work is testing my patience . lmao .","275870":"i heard about that one , but it wasn t graphic . they had followed an app to a weird location idk what the app is but it sounds cryptic and that s how they found the suitcase and then called the police .","275871":"i don t even know who that is .","275872":"alcohol , lol . some of my healthier coping mechanisms include sleeping , talking with friends , writing , and playing video

going on in your life . that s definitely a red flag , and it isn t healthy . do you know the root reason why you feel anxiety when you think about her ? that isn t really normal ideally you should be super comfortable around someone whom you consider a best friend , not the total opposite of that . i think you should reflect on why this is happening , because it probably is a lot more in depth than just getting bad vibes off of her . however , i think you should trust your gut overall . friendships are supposed to be encouraging and helpful , and it isn t helpful if you re around a friend

wholeheartedly agree with you .","275959":"i wouldn t post a picture of someone who isn t me . lmao .","275960":"yeah , it s so ridiculous .","275961":"i don t think you understand the difficulty people have when they want to get their tubes tied . you have to be over a certain age , they prefer if you already have children even if you don t want children , they even ask the husband boyfriend s permission which is disgusting .","275962":"he wanted to cut social security , he supported the iraq war , he doesn t support women , and the most obvious of all he s a p dophile .","275963":"i think my profile picture currently is pretty attractive . i m not that confident overall though .","275964":"taken this morning","275965":"i m always honest , so this seems redundant .","275966":"how people in general react to situations that are clearly showing their bias , whether it be racism , transphobia , sexism , ableism , etc etc .","275967":"one of the essays that i ve written which has received nearly k views on medium .","275968":"yeah , for some reason i always get transphobes on my page . bleh .","275969":"people have a difficult enough time getting their tubes tied , let alone removing their entire uterus . lmao .","275970":"these nails match my cat perfectly .","275971":"hot topic is a store , lol .","275972":"it was very common when i was growing up in the early to late s , haha . most people i know who are around my age had an emo scene goth phase . i went through all three phases , rofl . i went through a goth period where all i wore were fishnet shirts with tank tops and tripp pants . then i had an emo phase with the stereotypical hair over the eyes , rainbow belts , black and white converse , dark band shirts , etc etc . then i was also a scene kid for a while , sorta neon scene with the bright tee shirts and kandi and teased colored hair .","275973":"i did , alongside most of my friends at that point in time . lmao .","275974":"that isn t advisable by any health professional that i know , especially if someone wants to get rid of their period entirely . if someone has menstrual related medical issues or endometriosis or something , then taking the pill can relieve some of those symptoms , though .","275975":"yes , moving out of my parents house was probably the best decision i could make for myself . living with them was a source of great distress for me , and i ve been much more content with myself ever since i moved out .","275976":"i did my nails this morning too . ?","275977":"trans people don t owe anyone anything .","275978":"prejudice and systemic racism .","275979":"that doesn t surprise me , honestly . i ve seen a few things floating around online about how there s such a lack of knowledge about how to work with black hair , like cutting and styling and coloring it .","275980":"i like my privacy , so i only do video responses where i m talking , obviously when i m alone in the house . i also don t want my roommates to think i m talking to myself if they do end up hearing me , rofl .","275981":"i m assuming she was taught that in beauty school , haha .","275982":"i just like their regular iced coffee particularly cold brew .","275983":"it s the from movie mean girls , haha .","275984":"i can t help it if i ve got a heavy flow and a wide set v gina ! lmaoo .","275985":"i don t believe i have , no . i m pretty sure everything i ve seen in the sky has been some sort of aircraft , haha .","275986":"i m just happy that people are trying to embrace menstruation and create healthier less wasteful options instead of trying to enforce the stupid free bleeding concept like what happened a few years ago , yikes .","275987":"lol . i can t imagine it s much different than a menstrual pad , tbh . except it s kinda built into the underwear and you just wash the underwear instead of wasting pads paper .","275988":"o b s e s s e d .","275989":"if i don t have an answer to a question on askfm , then i usually just delete the question .","275990":"that happened to me a few nights ago , ugh . i think it was partially due to my emotions , and also partially due to the heat . there s only one air conditioner in the house , so on especially humid days nights , i can barely sleep because i m so overheated and sweaty .","275991":"we met through mutual friends , and she s been practicing cutting and coloring a hair since she was a teenager , haha . she s worked for several different salons over the years , but unfortunately lost her chair due to covid . when she s established again at her own salon , i ll be seeing her to do some funky colors again .","275992":"i guess skin picking is my weirdest habit , because it s actually pretty bad and my arms are covered in scars and scabs as a result of it .","275993":"depends on the woman , i ve been attracted to different women for different reasons .","275994":"i ve heard of them before and have seen ads online , but idk how i would feel about wearing them . i don t think i would be able to trust it , haha . if i wanted to try something different , then i would be more apt to try the diva cup or something similar , for example . there s also less waste with those too and it seems more secure than the period underwear .","275995":"for the most part , yes . everyone in the house has a different schedule , so i m alone while i eat for the majority of the time .","275996":"thank you ! ! yes , i totally understand that . that s why i was doing those video responses last night , rofl . i felt confident in myself , which is a weird change .","275997":"yeah , normally when i do video responses , i turn the camera away from me and speak . last night , i felt like showing my face though especially considering i just got my hair done .","275998":"aw , thank you ! ! i honestly didn t think anyone would take the time to actually watch them , lol . idk , maybe tomorrow ? i only do it when both of my roommates are out of the house , haha .","275999":"i ve been shaving my head for years , lol .","276000":"hello do you have a question ?","276001":"i would get rid of my mental illnesses , lol .","276002":"i ve always adapted easily to change , even if i m somewhat afraid of whatever changes there are .","276003":"regardless of someone s gender , i notice a person s height , smile , and the way they carry themselves first .","276004":"because they re likely selfish human beings who don t understand the nature of covid , and believe that they don t need a mask because they re healthy .","276005":"new hair , who dis ? ?","276006":"right now it s brown blonde , and we re coloring it deep red mahogany .","276007":"my instagram is private , so no .","276008":"probably on most of my social media , rofl . i m so overdue for a hair change , i m ecstatic to finally shave it again and get a fresh color .","276009":"yeah , it s happened on several occasions .","276010":"neither , i don t want to live in a city area and i also don t think i d do well in a very rural environment either .","276011":"i ll probably take some photos tonight or tomorrow .","276012":"? ? ? i ll cut and shave my hair as much as i want , lol . i also have half of my head shaved . she ll be coming over within the next minutes or so .","276013":"at this point , it s pretty much rd of the way down my back . i m going to chop off inches .","276014":"that s absolutely disgusting , and i m pretty sure it s illegal ?","276015":"no , i don t use the shout out feature and i also have shout outs turned off from entering my inbox .","276016":"i m doing well . like i stated in an earlier answer , i m just waiting for my friend to come over so she can cut , shave , and color my hair in a little bit .","276017":"last october , i got the samsung galaxy s .","276018":"hello i m doing pretty well , thanks ! ! my friend is coming over in a few to cut , shave , and color my hair .","276019":"hello do you have a question ?","276020":"my friend astoldbyjoanna is very knowledgeable about autism ! ! she hasn t been on askfm very often these days , but i m sure she ll be able to answer your questions .","276021":"not much , no . however , i can refer you to someone on askfm who knows a lot about autism .","276022":"new yorkers have a variety of accents depending on where in new york they re from . there s also the stereotypical new york accent that you hear in movies , lol .","276023":"i don t know anyone named emma .","276024":"i haven t seen that one .","276025":"i ve seen it , it isn t my style so i wouldn t wear it .","276026":"what ? lmao . i live in the suburbs , dude .","276027":"no , that is so far from the truth . lmao .","276028":"uh , i m not part of a gang . lmao .","276029":"you evidently don t know how many sections there are to new york state .","276030":"uh , none ? lmao .","276031":"yes , there are major differences in accents .","276032":"i used to know how to play guitar , but not so much anymore .","276033":"i absolutely hate it .","276034":"i vape occasionally , but i don t smoke cigarettes . i smoke weed on occasion .","276035":"i m drinking watching the movie swiss army man with daniel radcliffe and paul dano , and omg it s amazing .","276036":"spicy chicken veggie patty burgers .","276037":"my singing voice is terrible , and i used to play instruments when i was much younger .","276038":"music it s one of my greatest passions .","276039":"you ll have to ask someone who s confident in themself , haha . i can have confidence some days , but most of the time i don t .","276040":"medication and doctor appointments . even though they help me and i obviously need it , it s a lot out of my pocket and i wish health care was more affordable .","276041":"well tomorrow is saturday now my hair stylist is coming over tomorrow to do my hair , and then i have a doctor s appointment on sunday .","276042":"absolutely horrific . i would rather k ll myself than have that happen .","276043":"i m all right at the moment . i finished up with work , did the dishes and fed the catd , went and bought beer from , and now i m laying down and relaxing . i m also debating on whether or not to eat dinner tonight because i m not even hungry . my mood is a bit unstable , but that s nothing alcohol can t fix .","276044":"at the moment , not really which is weird because my anxiety is sky high rn , ugh . i can t figure out why i m so anxious and it s bothering me . the only thing i can think of is that my hair stylist postponed until tomorrow , but idk why i d be anxious over that .","276045":"les miserables , sweeney todd , heathers , the crow , girl interrupted , and secret window .","276046":"sweeney todd , but i m going to watch swiss army man tonight .","276047":"i ve been in three relationships .","276048":"nope , i just vape occasionally now . thank you ! !","276049":"dust , yeah . i have seasonal allergies , so stuff like pollen .","276050":"lol yes . i quit smoking cigarettes last september .","276051":"yeah , that s pretty irrational and selfish .","276052":"i ve been growing it for almost two years . i m tired of the length , color , and inches of growth of my undercut . i don t need a more serious look , that s boring and quite frankly i m tired of it . i don t feel like myself when my hair is natural .","276053":"because i desperately need it , i haven t gotten my hair done in so long .","276054":"last day of seeing this damn mane ! ! i m cutting inches off the bottom , shaving half my head and coloring it purple .","276055":"i have a tendency to be manipulative i m pretty self destructive .","276056":"i never said it wasn t .","276057":"the coughing fits were number one . i also felt lethargic and out of breath all the time , and honestly quitting was really impulsive for me . i finished off a pack one morning and decided i didn t want to buy another one , and i switched over to vaping so i wouldn t go through heavy nicotine withdrawals . i still vape , but not nearly as often anymore . i feel x better physically .","276058":"ideally , degrees fahrenheit . however , it s been much warmer considering it s the summer time .","276059":"not at all . your partner should be giving you reassurance and validation when you need it .","276060":"i smoked for years , so i completely understand .","276061":"not really , they re things you ve shared willingly on the internet so it s free for everyone to see .","276062":"yes , thankfully . i think the coughing stopped a few weeks after i quit .","276063":"i quit smoking cigarettes nearly a year ago .","276064":"i don t know how to cook much , but i can make delicious egg sandwiches in the morning .","276065":"i ve always wanted to go to new zealand and see where they filmed the lord of the rings , particularly the shire .","276066":"my best friend s bachelorette party i believe it was in . we stayed at a spa resort in the wine country of long island for two days , and the first day we went on a wine tasting tour to several vineyards in the area . one of the vineyards was also a horse ranch , so we got to pet horses , and they also had rose wine slushies . the second day was a spa day , you could choose whatever type of massage or whatever you wanted . i don t remember which one i chose , but nevertheless , i didn t like it , lmaoo . it didn t make me uncomfortable or anything , but it also didn t relax me like spas generally do to a person . i got up from the table in pain . even though i didn t like the spa , spending the two days with my best friend and her other bridesmaid was wonderful .","276067":"it s best to communicate your feelings than remain silent . if you re in a healthy relationship , your partner won t necessarily be offended by your feelings , and instead take the time to understand them and work on helping you and or the relationship . by remaining silent , you re allowing your feelings to control you , and that will only damage the relationship . don t settle for anything less than what you deserve . there s no such thing as being too picky , and the right person will walk into your life eventually sometimes when you least expect it . don t tolerate ab se or lying , shifty behavior , or people trying to control what you do or how you should feel . the right person will accept you as you are and have enough trust in you to allow you to be the best version of yourself .","276068":"if you smoke , then yeah i was almost getting to that point , i wouldn t throw up but i would be literally wheezing and feel like i was going to .","276069":"when i was smoking cigarettes , yeah . one of my main motivations to quit was because i would wake up every morning with a gut wrenching cough until i had my first cigarette .","276070":"caffeine , nicotine , and friends .","276071":"nope , i ve only been in a jacuzzi once and it was with a few friends when i was in high school .","276072":"i don t believe i do , actually .","276073":"nobody .","276074":"slipknot isn t extreme heavy metal music , lol .","276075":"my roommate and his girlfriend , if they count .","276076":"my friend who s a hair stylist is coming over to do it . i think it s going to be a burgundy purple . however , some salons are open where i live now .","276077":"haha , i still have two more hours until it s friday .","276078":"linkin park s reveal of unreleased music and other demos and merch in celebration of the th anniversary of their first album .","276079":"i haven t really eaten any strange things , haha . i guess squid would be the weirdest .","276080":"i learn best with hands on applications of things , especially when combined with both reading and writing . when i was in college , i preferred reading slides off of the powerpoint setup in the classroom and taking my notes . and then when i got home , i would rewrite those notes .","276081":"i m doing better today than i ve been doing over the past week or so , mainly because of linkin park s release of the hybrid theory th anniversary box set other exciting news from them . otherwise , this week went by pretty fast . i m getting my hair cut and colored tomorrow , which i m also excited about ! !","276082":"no , i don t believe in karma . there are too many people who do bad things that get away with them and don t get reprimanded for their actions , and there are too many good people that bad things happen to regardless of the good they ve done .","276083":"this obviously varies depending on the individual , since alcohol is technically a type of drug so people need to be wary when drinking alcohol . these are my experiences pros i feel much happier and content with my life . i m more outgoing and talkative . i tend to write better when i m tipsy not necessarily drunk . cons hangovers , obviously . alcohol is easily addictive . alcohol can wreck havoc on your body if you re not properly hydrating .","276084":"high school ap literature and forensics . college russian literature , sociology , criminology , and creative writing .","276085":"i do not remember a thing about elementary school .","276086":"i think they re all useful in different ways , but i like cameron the most , i think . she has a very interesting back story , that admittedly she does try to use to garner sympathy , but she s also one of the few people who have stood up against house the most and challenges his views the most .","276087":"i mean , it wouldn t offend me per say , but i would find it to be disrespectful and as if they re not taking my concerns seriously . if ever time you tried to talk to them about something that s bothering you , they belittle you or refuse to talk about the subject , then i personally would get fed up with the relationship . you don t deserve to be treated so poorly by someone like that .","276088":"i m simultaneously happy and unhappy with my life . on one hand , i m grateful for the opportunities that have presented themselves , but on the other hand , i struggle a lot with mental illness which makes me really depressed , self destructive , and s icidal .","276089":"why would that be bad ? i believe it can be incredibly helpful . i somewhat have a photographic memory , there are some things i can remember vividly after looking at it and picturing it in my mind , and other things not so much .","276090":"my day was good ! ! i worked my regular shift , ordered taco bell for dinner , took a really long nap , preordered the hybrid theory box set from linkin park , and now i m awake and answering questions from my inbox .","276091":"in light of linkin park s album hybrid theory , which is celebrating it s th anniversary this year , the band has created an exclusive box set of items of a bunch of different merch and music , ranging from an page art book of information and photographs previously unseen , a large poster of chester bennington , three art prints , three vinyl albums , five cds which contains a bunch of unreleased music from the band , three dvds , and a bunch of other things . so , i preordered it . this is probably the best thing to come out of for me .","276092":"i ve only been on picnics on a few rare occasions , but they were fun .","276093":"hello do you have a question ?","276094":"one bedroom apartment . in other news , i preordered the deluxe hybrid theory th anniversary box set and i m literally sobbing . ?","276095":"a few nights ago .","276096":"lol . precisely the logic anon is using .","276097":"yeah , i wasn t really talking physically helping him but supporting him emotionally is very important .","276098":"so then don t ask me for advice , lol . other people may think otherwise .","276099":"yes , it s a snapchat filter .","276100":"i never said i was an expert .","276101":"the best thing you can do is be there for him and support him . ask him if there s anything you can do for him and encourage him that he s still a valuable person even though the accident happened . his worth hasn t changed .","276102":"nah , i sound like a beached whale .","276103":"yes , i agree ! ! i hope therapy helped you","276104":"i ll try my best .","276105":"when someone says i m sorry you feel that way , they re not acknowledging that they themselves have done something wrong . they re blaming your feelings as opposed to themselves .","276106":"i recommend it if you like sweetness . it reminds me of the blue raspberry slushy from , lol . tomorrow i m going to try the peach iced tea .","276107":"i m drinking the blue ice flavor rn , and it s so yummy ! ! i definitely feel the energy already , lmaoo .","276108":"good morning ! ! today is my first day trying gfuel , let s see how it goes","276109":"saying i m sorry you feel that way isn t taking responsibility for their own behavior , it s honestly just a bullsh t way of acknowledging that someone feels a certain way and putting the blame on them , in a sense . if they said i m sorry , i ll work on being better and actually changed their behavior , that would be different .","276110":"sometimes it can be for the validation of others while other times it s because they re sincerely proud of themselves and want to help inspire people . it all depends on the individual .","276111":"in a sense , yes at least most people do . maturity mainly deals with experience and how you ve learned from those experiences , and as we get older , we obviously accrue more experiences . however , there are some people who are mature from a younger age because they ve dealt with harder experiences than others .","276112":"not really , no . at the bottom of it , most people are selfish and only care about themselves and what personally affects them , not necessarily the welfare of others . in that regard , i don t think humans will ever come to a common ground .","276113":"having a humble , down to earth attitude .","276114":"that isn t a real apology those are just words , and i hate when people say that honestly because they re not taking responsibility . changed behavior is an apology . perhaps you should reiterate it again and tell them they haven t changed , and if they continue to ignore you , then you re going to stop talking to them . it s better to be up front with people .","276115":"i think people have freedom of speech , so they realistically can criticize what they want . however , that doesn t absolve them of responsibility if their words hurt someone . criticizing religion is a bit different from criticizing race , because the latter is obviously racist . organized religion , on the other hand , obviously has its flaws . but as long as you re criticizing the religion itself and not individual people , i don t see the big deal .","276116":"october november . i like the crisp chill in the air , the changing colors of the leaves on the trees , halloween time , and just dressing up in cozy outfits .","276117":"sometimes it s worth giving them a second chance , but you should tell them how you feel if you re comfortable doing so .","276118":"i eat a variety of things .","276119":"the first sip of coffee in the morning .","276120":"np ! ! i hope it works out well .","276121":"for my anon . i never heard of baking soda and apple cider vinegar . that s really interesting ! !","276122":"i feel you . if you want to try to transition , look up cleansing conditioners . my best friend has been using them and it helps .","276123":"no , i ve never been able to use those because it s too distracting for me and i don t like the feeling of them on me when i try to sleep . i don t really need them anyway , i fall asleep fairly quickly and i usually have some sort of dim light on .","276124":"i don t really do anything different during autumn compared to the rest of the year . i just like being outside and enjoying the cooler temperatures .","276125":"lots of tea and water , sleep , and relaxation . there s really no treatment , you just have to wait for it to pass .","276126":"you definitely have to get used to it , i used to wash mine every day when i was much younger but i started prolonging it after i started coloring my hair funky colors so i could keep the color longer . eventually i got to where i am now . obviously during the summer , i sweat more which makes me build up more grease but considering i haven t left my house and don t work outside of my home , i still let it go a few extra days without washing because no one sees me . lmao .","276127":"i ve seen instances where it works and some instances where it doesn t work it all depends on your hair type . i only wash my hair once per week , for example , but i ve been doing this for years since my hair takes a while to get greasy now . there s also a cleansing conditioner people can use to cleanse their hair without using the harsh chemicals that are in regular shampoos . that might be worth looking into if you re curious .","276128":"i believe people have the capacity to change as long as they realize they re doing something wrong and need changing .","276129":"at least years ago .","276130":"i m not here to make friends .","276131":"hello do you have a question ?","276132":"can we all take a few moments to appreciate this masterpiece ? https youtu . be c

.","276135":"i routinely close out of all of the tabs for organization purposes , but i ve never deleted the history on my phone or my computer . there s nothing interesting for people to see anyway .","276136":"i haven t really watched anything informative or educational in a while , so i guess it would be something medical related through my binge watching of house md ? haha . not sure if that s even valid , though . who knows if the science in that show is even correct .","276137":"yes , i believe in life somewhere else in the universe . it would be naive to think that earth is only planet in the universe that is capable of sustaining life .","276138":"i d rather lose the ability to speak . i hate talking anyway .","276139":"i usually don t do that , haha .","276140":"i d say it s equal amounts of both . i do have a playlist of just woman fronted rock metal bands on spotify , though .","276141":"i got my gfuel order , yaaaayy .","276142":"i don t generally listen to music on my phone .","276143":"i thought i had shout outs turned off and askfm would have indicated that it was a shout out . hm , quite odd .","276144":"i m years old , as my bio indicates .","276145":"i don t have pockets .","276146":"nobody , lol .","276147":"at the moment , i ve been listening a lot to ashnikko , grandson , two feet , starset , linkin park , mike shinoda , missio , watsky , and nf .","276148":"no , i don t believe in love at first sight . you may lust after that person because of how they look or the vibe they give off , but love doesn t happen until you get to know someone on a deeper level .","276149":"i think i d be okay to try anything once .","276150":"yeah , i experienced sleep paralysis on one occasion . it was like my mind was awake but i couldn t move my body or even open my eyes . it was really strange .","276151":"pajama shorts and a tank top , like usual . lmaoo .","276152":"yes , i agree . it s one of my favorite movies of all time , and the novella is great as well .","276153":"i prefer fried eggs , but at home i usually make them scrambled or over easy .","276154":"anywhere between am to am .","276155":"i don t listen to podcasts , unfortunately .","276156":"yes , a majority of businesses won t allow you to shop in their store unless you have a face mask on because covid is still a big problem in new york .","276157":"i don t have any role models .","276158":"graduating from college despite struggling immensely with mental illness .","276159":"i m not afraid of heights , but i don t believe i would try cliff diving because i would probably seriously injure myself .","276160":"survive , haha . i don t have any short term goals or anything considering how ridiculous has been .","276161":"somewhere very far away from other people .","276162":"no , i don t believe dreams predict anything . they re just a manifestation of our subconscious thoughts .","276163":"any of the vacations i took with my friends when we went to upstate new york were the best ones . we used to try to go times per year , and they were always a lot of fun . they were only weekend trips , but it was a nice escape from everyday life for those three ish days .","276164":"i m looking forward to getting my hair cut and colored this week ! !","276165":"that s a horrific price for just one mask , the hell . where was this ? i can go to and get a pack of five for , like , or less . masks should definitely be either free of charge or more affordable , because they should be accessible to everyone .","276166":"i believe it s possible , yes . i ve completely gotten over my first two relationships , for example .","276167":"sometimes i love my life , other times i absolutely hate it .","276168":"i was trying to work this afternoon , but both of my roommates were home with their cousin and father moving things out of the basement , and the noise was distracting me . it didn t make me horribly angry , but i was a bit annoyed and ended up closing my bedroom door so i could concentrate .","276169":"i mean , both are pretty bad . haha . especially now considering we all have calendars in our phones and computers and can remind ourselves

and society to place such an importance on sex .","276193":"i don t believe in the concept of one soul mate , and soul mates don t necessarily have to be romantic relationships either . i have a few

tendency to glance at myself in the mirror every time i have to use the bathroom afterwards .","276203":"i m afraid of abandonment , as well as enclosed spaces .","276204":"improve the reporting blocking system , smh . people who get reported rarely get repercussions for their actions and those who are blocked can always make a new account and continue bothering people . it would be best if

paintings and furniture from my roommates previous house , as well as stuff my own parents didn t need anymore .","276216":"not necessarily . it can happen anywhere , as long as the two people are comfortable talking . most of my heart to heart talks have happened around a campfire in the backyard , or in someone s living room , or just in the bedroom in general . it doesn t really matter where it is as long as the feelings conveyed are sincere .","276217":"taking multivitamins every day . i feel x better now that i ve been getting my necessary vitamins every day , as opposed to in the past

.","276247":"there has been random knocking on the walls , doors , and radiators that my roommates and i can t figure out where it came from . there was one instance that my one roommate and i both woke up at the same time late at night because we heard footsteps going down the hall , but the other roommate was asleep we didn t even know we both woke up and heard it until a week later when we were talking . my roommate has seen shadow figures in the basement he s very sensitive to paranormal things , and he s even seen shadows in his room before . the basements stairs will creak even though no one is on them .","276248":"people talking over me when i m in the middle of speaking or people talking over others in general .","276249":"my parents house has a small attic , and it never

believe that your gender is in question here based on the little information you gave me . it sounds more like you re just realizing gender stereotypes and realize that you don t fit into the mold of being a typical guy , because from young ages we re just conditioned into thinking blue boy , pink girl , dolls girl , action figures boy , etc etc .","276279":"no ? it s pm , lol .","276280":"yes , i allow anonymous questions . even though i get a lot of trolling and inappropriate messages , i also like giving other nice anons the opportunity to ask me for advice or help if they need it . some

can shave my head cut my hair , lmaoo .","276315":"normally in those situations , i have a meltdown because i m equally concerned with other people involved as i am with my own involvement , and i don t want to put anyone at a fault or myself either . after i ve calmed down , i usually try to make a compromise with whatever whoever is involved . if that doesn t work , i allow myself to take the fall .","276316":"me and one of my roommates i have two roommates . i usually clean the bathroom and kitchen floor counter , and my other roommate does all of the vacuuming and dusting and whatnot .

so bold , but i ve grown to like it .","276318":"no , i don t tolerate disrespect especially in a relationship or friendship . there s supposed to be mutual respect in any sort of interpersonal relationship whether it s friends , partners , family , etc etc , and if you don t respect them , then you cannot say you truly love them .","276319":"they go hand in hand , so they re equally important . you cannot truly love someone unless you also respect them .","276320":"no , just one floor .","276321":"three bedrooms , a living room dining area , one bathroom , and a kitchen

seriously i am panicking i have been trying for hours but i can t find anything to bring it back to the list . help ahh , i m not really too familiar with how amazon wishlists work tbh . i have one of my own , but it s mainly for myself to keep track of things i potentially want to buy . i ve never really given it out to people because i don t want others to see my address if it even shows the address , idk . there might be an faq or support link on amazon somewhere regarding wishlists , i would assume . i m sorry i couldn t be more helpful ! !","276341":"considering i have memory loss to a degree , it s easier for me to forget , lmao .","276342":"certain people in my life , yes .","276343":"my roommate s father paid for dinner last night , so i got free sushi technically

but i still need some sort of dim light illuminating my room in order to fall asleep comfortably .","276355":"i usually talk to a friend if i need encouragement , because then i can at least bounce ideas or my feelings off of them and discuss what i m feeling in a healthy manner .","276356":"oh definitely not , i m terrified of driving anywhere further than an hour away from where i live lol . in those cases , my friends or my ex would drive and i would sit passenger .","276357":"this one is kinda old , but i like it .","276358":"i don t believe i m a brave person by any means , haha .","276359":"pros listening to music and showing each other the new music we re interested in . having good conversations along the way . stopping at interesting rest stops or scenic views . cons it

household chores in between on my breaks if i want to .","276365":"party music doesn t bother me , i can sleep right through it .","276366":"mainly alternative rock .","276367":"i have two questions

roommate and his girlfriend , and i took a very long nap this afternoon . tomorrow , i have no plans besides to continue relaxing and perhaps clean the bathroom .","276390":"i m probably not the best person to ask this question to , because i didn t handle my most recent breakup very well at all , lmaoo . i was extremely s icidal for a long time , was crying every night , and numbed myself with

on a toasted roll if i have them in the house .","276396":"yes , i believe that s a pretty rude and arrogant thing to say to someone because it does sound like you think the other person is inferior

claim you re more entitled to speak up on a topic .","276397":"i wouldn t personally do it , but that s ultimately your decision .","276398":"my own brain , lmaoo .","276399":"nothing out of the ordinary , i ve just been doing my daily and weekly tasks as usual ones that are routine as well as ones that crop up randomly . i asked for a raise two weeks ago , but in light of the pandemic , my company has issued a salary freeze .","276400":"? ? ?","276401":"if someone has broken my trust , i don t normally trust them ever again .","276402":"yes , i still have a toxic person in my life . i ve distanced myself from them and set boundaries with them over the past few months , and i ve also been attending therapy again to deal with my feelings .","276403":"yeah , although i m unsure if the person group genuinely didn t like me or i just assumed they didn t like me because of my own paranoia . either way , i ve always distanced myself from people when i have those feelings because i think they re better off without me .","276404":"thank you ! ! i m having a virtual appointment with my therapist on monday which i m kinda nervous about , so hopefully that will get some things off my chest .","276405":"i honestly don t know , haha . i ve been having a difficult time lately in finding the motivation to continue pushing forward , and the only things that have been distracting me from those feelings are work and watching my friends and other gamers play video games .","276406":"to make the world better for the future generations .","276407":"honestly , i m just happy it s the weekend because this week has been terrible in terms of my personal life and my professional life , and i need these two days to myself to relax and prepare myself for next week . however this week during work , i ve been listening to this elder scrolls music compilation , which has been great https www . youtube . com watch ? v zm hvi vy","276408":"i m introverted around large groups of people and extroverted around very small groups of people . however , i lean more towards being introverted because i still need time to myself after being around people to recoup , calm down , and recharge .","276409":"the only thing i ve done this summer is work , haha . i was invited to go fishing today , but i declined this morning because i wasn t feeling well and it s very cloudy outside .","276410":"not really , no . especially considering the beaches around me are always congested with people .","276411":"no , i don t like heavy foods so that would be too heavy for me to eat . i also don t really like bbq chicken very much , haha . if i order pizza , i usually just eat regular cheese slices and occasionally slices with pepperoni on them .","276412":"i believe the last movie i

new york .","276417":"yes , i ve been diagnosed with major depression disorder and have dealt with depression and anxiety since i was a teenager . i ve attempted s icide , and i was going to do it again when i was when i decided to go to the doctor instead . she put me on medication and gave me referrals to a psychiatrist and a therapist .","276418":"i don t remember what it is that i said , but i was talking to my roommate about how my other roommate and his girlfriend just left the house to run some errands .","276419":"get my own apartment or house where i can live independently ,

remain in existence , but until we develop a vaccine , it ll probably continue to remain as severe as it currently is .","276425":"i m on askfm to answer questions , not have conversations .","276426":"i don t believe so , but i haven t been to an eye doctor in like years , so i wouldn t be surprised if i am legally blind at this point .","276427":"it eases my anxiety .","276428":"my fingers , both of my arms , and my face .","276429":"i watched parasite for the first time last month that movie was intense . i highly recommend it .","276430":"he eats a bit more than the rest of

.","276435":"not really , lol . people have the freedom to do what they want with their own bodies . if they want a fake tan , then they can get a fake tan . especially when it comes to those clothes and foams it s a lot healthier than going to a tanning salon or sitting out in the sunlight .","276436":"sure ! that sounds fun .","276437":"no , i m not even sure what that is . lol .","276438":"organized religion is overall bad , in my opinion . i ve never been a religious person most religious people i know seem like they re completely brainwashed by whatever religion they

.","276440":"i m on askfm to answer questions , not to talk .","276441":"askfm isn t instagram , lol .","276442":"my instagram is private i don t give out my username .","276443":"the term psychopath is pretty archaic and isn t used in clinical circles anymore . it increases the stigma associated with mental illnesses . however , depending on the individual , it s usually a combination of genetics and environmental factors .","276444":". i m obviously a vampire .","276445":"i believe i did a very long time ago when i was a teenager . since that time , i ve only routinely seen two different

of the game but i ve never played it before .","276448":"i don t believe i m much different , except i can express myself better via writing than i can verbally .","276449":"my week has honestly been terrible , lol . i had a breakdown tuesday night that was a long time coming , probably in relation to the intense therapy session i had the night before . i ended up clocking out of work early on wednesday because i kept crying and couldn t handle anything . yesterday was a bit better and i got a lot of work done , and today has been good so far . hopefully things look up from here .","276450":"no , i have no interest in that .","276451":"yes , i believe in true love .","276452":"i m much more active on askfm . i check twitter almost every day , but i don t really tweet very often .","276453":"good is an average understanding or proficiency in something , while exceptional means that your understanding of something or your ability or do something is above average .","276454":"i don t know enough about the topic , so i can t give you an answer . you re better off researching the topic yourself .","276455":"you re better off asking an epidemiologist or doing research on the topic that doesn t include facebook research .","276456":"yeah , i ve known a few people over the years who have gotten implants .","276457":"thank you . i ve had a pretty good start to the day already woke up before my alarm and made breakfast coffee with time to spare . i just have to endure the next eight hours of work before i can relax , lol .","276458":"working is the most important thing in my life currently .","276459":"yeah , i ll mumble certain things when i m alone and i ll laugh out loud to myself .","276460":"i think it depends on the context , because it could also be a means by which someone shuts down a person who s advancing on them that the person doesn t want to talk to . which , when you think about it , is a bit horrific that people get turned off by self confidence , or at least a person s ability to recognize that they re attractive . it s almost as if people men in particular are attracted to those who are not self confident or vulnerable , who perhaps are looking for that validation that they re beautiful handsome .","276461":"showers . i absolutely hate taking baths , lol .","276462":"you evidently didn t read my last response .","276463":"you re missing the point again . lmao . number one if a man prefers his partner to shave their armpits , that says a lot about them as a person . they should love and accept their partner regardless of their body hair . body hair is natural and superficial . number two i m referring to society as a whole . the media and the beauty fashion industries have conditioned us into believing that hairless beautiful , when that isn t the case whatsoever . historically speaking , the idea of women shaving stems from the fact that men preferred women to be hairless because it represented an adolescent image . now that we re in contemporary times , we ve recognized that it s gross and problematic , and therefore , there should be less pressure for women to shave because they re a woman regardless of what hair is on their body .","276464":"you re missing the point . the fact that men prefer hairless women is what s p dophilic , because that s the society that influences us , and people can choose whether or not they want to shave . i shave every now and again because it s my own choice .","276465":"the idea of someone being hairless as s xually appealing stems from the idea that prepubescent adolescents are more attractive than adults who grow hair . it s a logical association .","276466":"unless it s affecting my work , i wouldn t do much about it . people will always like or dislike you , and if someone is immature enough to talk sh t about you and spreads rumors about you as an adult in the workplace , then that says more about them than about me . if it gets bad enough , i d talk to my supervisor about it . but this has never happened to me before .","276467":"cheers ! ! i m currently drinking voodoo ranger ipa .","276468":"hi friends ! ! ask me questions while i watch some streamers on twitch","276469":"on my computer screen ? that s spotify , lol .","276470":"i ve found it really difficult to answer this question , mainly because i seldom ask people for advice to begin with . and when i do ask people for advice , i honestly rarely take their advice and apply it because i m too headstrong and prefer to do things my own way .","276471":"money wouldn t really matter too much to me in such an instance , as much as time would . i would likely try to go visit my best friend who lives in upper new england and spend the day with her and her husband , while we have a campfire outside , get drunk , eat delicious food , and just talk the night away .","276472":"i would discuss how ableism still exists in society with respect to physical and mental disabilities , and how mental illnesses aren t often taken as seriously as physical illnesses because they re invisible illnesses . this also applies to chronic illnesses that aren t seen by the eye , such as fibromyalgia , crohn s disease , and other illnesses .","276473":"i think it would be exciting to be part of the french revolution in the late s .","276474":"thank you , kittie . your words of encouragement are always appreciated .","276475":"i ve been taught plenty of lessons throughout my life , although most of them were a bit late in life because i was too arrogant or naive to believe otherwise .","276476":"the value of my own self worth . i went through more than two decades of my life absolutely hating myself and believing i deserved nothing good , and it s only been recently that i ve been learning of my own worth and value .","276477":"the value of some friendships and certain relationships . you may think you re grateful in the moment , but it isn t until you lose that relationship or friendship that you begin to wonder whether or not you were truly grateful for those moments and experiences especially if the person in question died .","276478":"ableism as it relates to mental health and physical disabilities .","276479":"you can be confident and self aware without boasting about it . to be conceited means that you re so full of yourself that you feel the need to express that confidence in exuberance to others , almost to the point where you re seeing yourself as superior to them . regular confidence and self awareness doesn t give you that pompous attitude .","276480":"i m a scorpio , which is a water sign apparently .","276481":"no thanks , lmaoo .","276482":"it sounds like fun , so sure .","276483":"every year has its own ups and downs , and i honestly can t recall what a favorite year would even be . it s definitely not , that s for sure . lmaoo .","276484":"true crime , writing , literature , mental health advocacy , photography , nature , video games , psychology , sociology , anthropology , animals , etc etc .","276485":"i m honestly terrible at cooking , so i d order something nice but obviously not pass it off as my own .","276486":"i don t remember .","276487":"my depression is causing me to spiral again , lol .","276488":"i m talented at writing .","276489":"video games don t cause violence , no . if someone is already an inherently violent person then they may gravitate towards violent video games , but the video games themselves don t cause the violence .","276490":"yeah , on more occasions than i d like to admit , lol .","276491":"i don t discuss finances on askfm .","276492":"probably not , tbh . it s my main form of communication with people i also need the internet for my job .","276493":"i got it brand new the first car i ve driven that hasn t been preowned , haha .","276494":"dark chocolate , it doesn t upset my stomach as much lol .","276495":"hershey s cookies cream .","276496":"yeah , there are a few people . if i m bored enough , i ll go on their pages and see if there are any new answers that i might have missed .","276497":"i ve been driving since i was . i have a hyundai accent .","276498":"depends on the area you live in , but as a whole , yes .","276499":"eggs and fruit .","276500":"i have a personality disorder , so it can go either way . not that personalities can be inherently masculine or feminine , at any rate .","276501":"if it s consensual , then there s nothing wrong with it .","276502":"i know nothing about mormons or freemasonry .","276503":"i can t choose just one because it depends on my mood . lamb and rice platters . sushi . veggie burrito bowls . cheeseburgers sometimes .","276504":"i just took my second depression nap of the day and don t feel any better .","276505":"i ve never broken a bone before .","276506":"prozac , xanax , lamictal , and rexulti .","276507":"i only show my emotions in front of a few close friends . it makes me uncomfortable otherwise .","276508":"i m not in the mood for videos today .","276509":"well considering i don t really remember half of my life to begin with , i would rather lose all of my memories from birth until the present . to make and remember new long term memories seems much more appealing .","276510":"my psychiatrist did that to me once . my old psychiatrist before she retired diagnosed me with bpd , but they somehow lost my paperwork when they transferred me to a new psychiatrist . my psychiatrist wouldn t hear me out when i told her that i exhibited the traits , solely because i wasn t exhibiting them in her office , and basically told me to not to talk about it to her again because she didn t believe i had it . she s still my psychiatrist because i honestly don t care anymore . i m just there to see her to refill my meds at this point .","276511":"it s unfortunately really common here in the united states , not necessarily among corporations exactly , but the mentality among a lot of people themselves .","276512":"they re a very christian organization , and the coo of the company has made public statements opposing gay marriage , saying it was against god or something to that effect . they ve also been known to donate to anti lgbtq organizations .","276513":"i ve only seen a handful of marvel movies , but guardians of the galaxy was good .","276514":"chick fil a . i won t eat there or give them money because they re extremely homophobic .","276515":"we call my roommate by a shortened version of his last name instead of his actual name , haha .","276516":"i don t watch anime .","276517":"not in a romantic context , no . i m not interested in dating at the moment .","276518":"i had a breakdown last night and couldn t stop crying this morning , so i clocked out of work early and have been asleep for the past two hours . i wanted to call my therapist , but then i realized i don t have her phone number , so i m going to have to wait until next week to talk to her about this .","276519":"obviously not .","276520":"hello anon . do you have a question ?","276521":"i ve never done it before and i have no desire to .","276522":"i ve never felt a desire to , lol . i see enough tiktok videos on facebook , instagram , and twitter .","276523":"i usually just order appetizers , haha .","276524":"bringing this back because i was proud of this breakfast .","276525":"i don t remember exactly , but it was when i was in high school . she had a heart attack , and afterwards she never took proper care of herself , which eventually led to her becoming morbidly obese and develop a host of bad diseases , like rheumatoid arthritis and gout and diabetes , among other things . she s essentially couch bound . she can t move from the couch except to use the bathroom and go into the kitchen , and she stays on the couch all day watching television . all of the cleaning used to be done by me from the age of like , onward or so . now all of that responsibility is put on my father .","276526":"we ve discussed it with her on several occasions , and she was offended by the idea stating well , i have my family , as if we re all supposed to run to her at a moment s notice even though my brother and i have moved out and have our own lives . my aunt and cousin won t help her anymore either , my cousin claims that she can t see my mother in the state she s in because it aggravates her anxiety , but honestly i think she s lying because she s fed up with helping my mother as well . i ve only spoken to my mother on a handful of occasions since our initial blowout a few weeks ago , and i ve only been over there once in the past month . which honestly . . . feels really good . i feel bad for my father and i eventually need to talk to him separately about what to do about her , but i can t keep allowing her to control me and my emotions .","276527":"i don t think they re happy together , no . prior to my mother becoming disabled , she actually talked to me about wanting to divorce my father because they didn t get along in all honesty , he just didn t want to deal with her sh t probably . i think he feels obligated to help her because of the fact that she can t live unassisted , and she refuses any sort of external help , even an in home aide part time or a cleaning service . he s become the source of income and the primary caregiver , and while i feel bad for him , i also don t want to get sucked into that old life that i had where she had control over me . moving out of my parents house was the best decision i could make for my own well being .","276528":"french fries and ice cream .","276529":"i don t use tiktok .","276530":"i started therapy again with a brand new counselor , if that counts ? my first appointment with her was last week , and i had a follow up appointment last night .","276531":"draco malfoy , lestat de lioncourt , frank castle , the joker , chloe price from life is strange , and trevor from gta v .","276532":"one of my toes that wouldn t affect my balance , haha . there are plenty of people with missing toes who aren t necessarily affected by it very much in terms of balance , coordination , and mobility .","276533":"leigh isn t my birth name , so i would change it to leigh .","276534":"i would rather be a movie actor because then i wouldn t have to deal with the stress on being on a stage and having a thousand people watching me in real time . i have social anxiety , and something like that is nightmarish to me .","276535":"i don t really get embarrassed easily , but i did end up passing gas at the kitchen table when i was over my ex s house for a family dinner years upon years ago . it was when his father first started dating his girlfriend , so i didn t know her very well . it was extremely loud and abrupt , and although everyone was laughing , i was absolutely mortified , lmaoo . they still poke fun at me about it to this day .","276536":"i had a science teacher in high school who was honestly an unstable wreck . i wholeheartedly believe he was on drugs , because sometimes he would come into class and act normal while other times he would barge into the classroom with glassed over , red eyes and start yelling at random kids in the class . i m pretty sure he doesn t work there anymore , but it was just a bizarre circumstance . nearly half of the kids failed their regents examination because he didn t teach us very well .","276537":"you look prettier without makeup ! that seems to be the most common one , tbh . i know it s supposed to be a compliment , but it makes me believe that it s a backhanded compliment because they re essentially saying that i don t look good when i do wear makeup .","276538":"my fridge is so cold that when i put the milk in the back the fridge , it ended up freezing over the other day . lmao . that isn t really a mistake , but i thought it was hilarious .","276539":"i constantly forget that i have my phone charging cord on the side of my bed on the floor i have an extension cord beneath my bedside table , so i m constantly getting off the bed and tripping over the wire . i haven t fallen yet . lmao .","276540":"today has been a wild day , lol . between me panicking this morning because i woke up at am when i had to clock into work at am i clocked in with one minute to spare , thank god , and then the tropical storm that went through , it s been a bit ridiculous . i went outside and investigated the front and back yards , and besides the broken fences , nothing bad happened to my property . there are just a lot of broken tree branches everywhere .","276541":"honestly , sleep . it s too early for me to go to bed , though , and it s also too late for me to take a nap .","276542":"i don t know very much about it , although i heard that allegedly the reason why it was banned in other countries was because it was stealing people s personal information . i haven t done any research on the issue , though , so i can t give a formal opinion .","276543":"i m single now , but i fell in love with my ex within the first year of dating him . i was in awe of how emotionally strong he was despite the hardships he went through , we had a lot in common especially with respect to music and art , and we could talk about nearly anything for hours . he was supportive of me trying to quit self h rming and didn t judge me for it or my mental illnesses .","276544":"order some comfort food , have a few drinks , and put on a movie or television show that relaxes calms me down .","276545":", excluding back up accounts and inactive accounts .","276546":"compromising in a relationship is healthy because it means you both have communicated and have come to a mutual agreement on something .","276547":"favorite fast food place dunkin donuts and taco bell . least favorite fast food place kfc or boston market .","276548":"i m not interested in dating right now , so i wouldn t date any of my friends from askfm .","276549":"i wouldn t really want to be any of those , but i took a few philosophy classes in college and liked them . therefore , i d likely choose to be a philosopher .","276550":"i d say i m equal amounts of both .","276551":"i used to like watching gymnastics during the olympics , but i haven t watched it since i was in high school .","276552":"video games , television shows movies , and drinking alcohol .","276553":"i ve been given weird somewhat bad gifts before , but i ve never returned them .","276554":"apparently he isn t as rude or mean as he makes himself out to be on his television shows it s just a persona he plays that was encouraged by producers and whatnot . i ve seen videos and tiktoks here and there of him cooking with his family , which have been really cute . although i do admit , some of the things he s said on his cooking shows are hilarious .","276555":"it depends on the restaurant . sometimes i ll order the same thing if i know i love the dish enough , but other times i ll try something new .","276556":"hello i m doing well . my roommate s family just left , so now the house is nice and quiet and i can wind down after working today and dealing with people lol . the storm passed and now it s sunny outside , so my roommate is going to call the landlord tomorrow so that the fences can get fixed .","276557":"i usually love storms too , just without the property damage . lmao .","276558":"i don t remember .","276559":"yeah , me and my roommates are fine thankfully we have power still .","276560":"i think it was a tropical storm by the time it got to me . but there are trees down everywhere , blocking roads , power lines down , most of the island doesn t have power right now . also , just found another part of my fence that s broken on the other side of the yard . ugh .","276561":"my friends were posting videos on snapchat and instagram of all of the damage on the roads , it s so wild .","276562":"we got the remnants of the hurricane this afternoon now my fence is broken . fml .","276563":"it isn t rude , particularly on a q a site that isn t really meant for conversation to begin with . and not wanting to talk to strangers on other social media platforms isn t rude at all , most people just aren t comfortable with it .","276564":"i m in a decent mood , although i m still coming down from an anxiety episode because i woke up super late and only had minutes to get out of bed , boot up my computer , and log into work . lmao .","276565":"obviously not .","276566":"that isn t arrogant at all . i would put it in my bio , but nobody ever reads bios so i d rather just tell the person through an answer because i don t give out my social media accounts to strangers either .","276567":"i think an important aspect of unconditional love is that you re loving that person for who they are in that moment you re not concerned with the future where feelings may change , because you understand you ll tackle that issue if or when it comes about .","276568":"my greatest strength is my determination to move forward regardless of what is trying to stop me . my greatest weakness is my own self destructive behaviors , self doubt , and and a lack of self esteem .","276569":"i d play an entire playlist of songs at my wedding , rofl . i would probably make my own playlist prior to it .","276570":"i think that s immature , tbh . you should at least give them the closure by talking face to face , or at the very least , over the phone or via video chat . something that s more personal than sending an emotionless text message .","276571":"regardless of someone s gender , i generally notice a person s hair , smile , and eyes first .","276572":"i ll have
