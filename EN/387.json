?","358253":"not too much . we kind of all went our separate ways after graduating high school . only one stayed since we ended up going to the same college . nothing changed with that friendship at the time . then she ended up graduating and going on to a different college which i didn t see her much then . her stepdad also died . which kind of made her talk to me even less . we still have eachother on social media but haven t talked in a while . it s sad seeing old memories since used to comment a lot . . . my best friend is still my best friend . its different though since she has three kids . but ya , we always start right back where we left off . in maine , it was more family friends there . including a friend that s like another sister to me . there s not really anyone around my age and if there was they d end up being alcoholics and into weed or other drugs . never really looked or said anything to me . i don t really feel like my interactions changed besides ones already mentioned . i ve always had a shy sizing people up vibe . environment has been ma to maine and az . it s hard meeting new people . some aren t friendly when i try or never see again . i had

anyone else should need to know everything that happened . people need to stop acting so entitled on here because i don t give everything away . when i do say things they take it too far . when i even mention a guy , i m hounded with questions . whenever relationships are mentioned someone has to bring up my last one .","358264":"i m fully aware of what happened . the repercussions of my actions
