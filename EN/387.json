it's simply bringing to light the injustices that have been done upon other people by men, creating this culture of toxic masculinity that exists today. it doesn't say *all* men do this, which is exemplified by the fact that there were men who were breaking up fights, stopping their friends from chasing after girls, etc etc.\n  \n  it's setting a good example for younger boys and young adults to open their eyes as to what acceptable versus unacceptable behavior is. \"boys will be boys\" is not an acceptable phrase to use anymore because there should be no excuse for violence or harassment, and those behaviors need to be corrected.\n  \n  there's so much pressure on men to act and behave a certain way that gillette is trying to break that pressure and point out that certain things are *not* okay, and we should educate the future generations accordingly.\n  ","415252":"\n  sometimes i feel as if askfm is implementing these changes in an attempt to start competition between users, lmao.\n  \n  first they revealed how many followers everyone had, and now they're posting up how many coins people have and stacking users against each other, both within their friends list and within their countries.\n  \n  seems like some sort of marketing tool to make people answer more questions & be more active on the site.\n  ","415253":"\n  if my friend turned out to be racist and continuously made racist remarks without attempting to understand why their thoughts\/behavior is wrong, then i wouldn't be their friend anymore.\n  ","415254":"\n  to me personally, being fake is

but it only really applies to places outside of big cities (i.e. boston, new york city, los angeles) where it's difficult to get somewhere if you don't drive. where i live, you pretty much *need* to drive everywhere, or else you'll wind up spending too much money on taxis and ubers and trains.\n  \n  in bigger cities, there's less of a need for driving because everything is basically in walking distance or there are subways and buses.\n  ","415268":"\n  i disagree. people travel to other countries all the time for a variety of reasons, whether it's due to work, school, personal leisure, etc

scale, but obviously i didn't mean \"not many at all\" considering the context it was in.\n  \n  also, i don't even know how many people even have a doctorate -- regardless of race. i don't personally know anyone who has a doctorate (even my personal doctor doesn't have an MD), so i don't really think saying \"thousands\" instead of \"millions\" isn't a big stretch.\n  ","415270":"\n  DRIVING. i

stash's peach ginger tea. it's the perfect combination of fruity and spicy, and it helps me when i have digestive issues !! i don't put anything in it.\n  \n  otherwise, i also love earl grey tea. i usually take it with a small splash of milk and one sugar.\n  ","415290":"\n  my favorite authors are stephen king, anne rice, franz kafka, j.k. rowling, and george orwell. however, i've read a lot of books who aren't from those authors and have a few favorite books from other writers entirely.\n  ","415291":"\n  do you mean the chilling adventures of sabrina, like the netflix tv show ??\n  \n  if so, then yes !! i only watched the first few episodes, but it was really intriguing and entertaining.\n  ","415292":"\n  none of my IRL friends use askfm, so in that respect, no.\n  \n  however, i

fantasy-like and dramatic as opposed to suspenseful.\n  ","415294":"\n  do you mean do people with insomnia have a higher mortality rate than those without insomnia ??\n  \n  i personally don't know. you're better off googling this question or asking a health care professional.\n  ","415295":"\n  i've been wearing glasses since i was a child. i used to wear contact lenses, but i've stopped wearing them within the past two years because they would hurt too much when i stare at a computer monitor all day.\n  ","415296":"\n  no, having a traumatic childhood isn't part of the diagnostic criteria when it comes to personality disorders. you can certainly have a personality disorder without experiencing childhood trauma, although it is a bit rare.\n  ","415297":"\n  i'm allowed to leave early or call out of work without repercussion, within reason, due to my mental health problems. lately, i haven't been leaving early or calling out very often at all, but it used to be a frequent issue in the

","415302":"\n  if you read my bio, you would see that i'm non-binary.\n  \n  regardless, hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","415303":"\n  society needs to get over the stigma associated with having a complex mental illness, i.e. personality disorders, dissociative disorders, psychotic disorders, etc etc. due to misunderstanding of mental health in the past and the perpetration of stigma carried out by the media, people with complex mental disorders are often viewed as dangerous, manipulative, attention-seeking, and weak.\n  \n  in reality, people with those illnesses are often more of a danger to themselves than other people.\n  ","415304":"\n  i have dozens of movies that fit that category, lol.\n  \n  girl interrupted, the crow, heathers, the lord of the rings trilogy, the harry potter series, sweeney todd, secret window, the number 23, queen of the damned, the shining, and i am not a serial killer.\n  ","415305":"\n  technically speaking, my mental illnesses make me \"crazy.\"\n  \n  tbh i don't really like the use of that word at all -- it only adds to the stigma associated with mental illnesses, especially with respect to disorders that include psychosis. there's such a bad connotation when it comes to the term \"crazy\" and it's been harmful toward people who struggle with their mental health.\n  ","415306":"\n  most of the people i follow are active,

really know the whole science behind why some people have higher IQs than others, though.\n  ","415319":"\n  no, i actually posted the other day in an answer that i never learned how to ride a bicycle.\n  ","415320":"\n  no, your intelligence isn't based upon your race, as far as i'm aware. your intelligence is based upon life experience and level of education.\n  ","415321":"\n  some mental illnesses are more severe than others. you're not useless, though -- not being able to work due to mental health reasons is incredibly common and people are on disability every day.\n  \n  i'm

RIGHT.\n  ","415325":"\n  well it's certainly not my cup of coffee, LOL. that shit is gone within 30 minutes.\n  \n  what lasts the longest in my life, though, are my friendships. i don't make friends easily, and the people i *am* friends with have been my friends for multiple years.\n  ","415326":"\n  not until they're an adult. parents should be parenting their children as they grow older, especially in adolescent and teenage years, and be sources of guidance instead of someone that a child considers a \"friend\" instead of a parent.\n  \n  when children see their parents as friends instead of their parents, it leads to a lot of miscommunication, and parents tend to let their discipline slide because they want to maintain that \"friend\" persona, which isn't healthy.\n  ","415327":"\n  yeah, he's struggled with depression in the past and he has PTSD.\n  ","415328":"\n  the knowledge that i'll always have my boyfriend & close friends as means of support if i'm ever deteriorating in terms of my mental health. they give me hope and they've always been a source of inspiration for me.\n  \n  also, the future. thinking about my future with my boyfriend gives my hope and inspires me to keep going.\n  ","415329":"\n  my boyfriend insisted that \"journaling\" wasn't a real word when i told him i spent the morning journaling, so we bickered back & forth for like 3 minutes before i googled it and showed him the screenshot, lmao.\n  \n  granted it wasn't a *real* argument, but he was so adamant that it wasn't a real word and insisted that i say \"i wrote in my journal\" instead of saying \"i was journaling.\" lmfao.\n  ","415330":"\n  i agree. i'm a very paranoid person by nature and have been stalked\/followed before, so i don't reveal any personal information about myself on sites like askfm, twitter, instagram, etc etc.\n  ","415331":"\n\n   @littlesha_\n  \n  is under no obligation to reveal which high school she attended, considering that's normally very private information.\n  ","415332":"\n  your intelligence level has no correlation with having an addiction to nicotine, lol.\n  \n  i consider myself to be somewhat intelligent & i smoke cigarettes, so.\n  ","415333":"\n  then i wouldn't hire either of them, lol. having experience with children is integral to babysitting. i wouldn't want someone around my child who had no idea how to handle a child at all.\n  ","415334":"\n  depends on their experience with children. if a person with no mental illnesses didn't have any experience dealing with children, then i wouldn't want them babysitting my child. having a mental illness doesn't make you an inherently violent or bad person.\n  ","415335":"\n  no, i haven't. i don't know enough people to really set a friend up with anyone, haha. i only have one friend who's single, either way.\n  ","415336":"\n  i don't want to change any of those things about myself, besides perhaps the whole \"success\" thing. i wasn't saying that having those qualities were bad, it's just the opposite of who i am.\n  ","415337":"\n  probably the complete opposite of who i am, LOL. someone who doesn't struggle with mental illness, has been successful in life, plays sports and doesn't have an ounce of creativity in their body, and is straight edge.\n  ","415338":"\n  i'm still myself regardless of who's watching me or not. i spent too much of my life worried about what people thought of me, to the point where i often put on a facade. now that i'm older, i just don't care anymore. if you don't like me for me, then you're obviously unnecessary to my life.\n  ","415339":"\n  i think the idea behind parallel universes is interesting and it's a great subject to write about, but i don't know if i necessarily believe in them.\n  ","415340":"\n  for the most part, yes. i try to help people as much as i'm physically or mentally able to do so in that moment, especially people who are close to me.\n  ","415341":"\n  LOL.\n  \n  my last piece of good news was that my close friend said she was available to hang out tomorrow night. i haven't seen her in a while and we need to catch up on each other's lives, so i'm excited to talk to her over a few drinks.\n  ","415342":"\n  no, it isn't valid to me at all. if i had money, i would be able to progress forward in my life more and attain happiness at a faster rate.\n  ","415343":"\n  there's nothing supernatural or evolutionary about having a severe mental illness. having disorders such as ASPD and DID simply mean that you've been subjected to intense, prolong abuse from a very young age to the point where you've developed a longstanding personality disorder (ASPD) or a fracturing identity in an effort to protect yourself (DID).\n  \n  i've never seen either dexter or split, but i've heard that split was incredibly ableist and demonized people with DID by portraying them as these violent creatures, when in reality, people with DID and other severe disorders are more of a threat to themselves than other people.\n  ","415344":"\n  the biggest lesson life has taught me is that no matter how much you can have compassion for and genuinely care for someone else, or even a group of people, you *still* need to take care of yourself first and foremost. your happiness matters just as much as everyone else's happiness, and you shouldn't forego your own well being and stability just to make someone else more comfortable.\n  ","415345":"\n  i think it's absolutely fine to judge people who are detrimental to society as a whole, such as cold-blooded k*llers, r*pists, p*dophiles, nazis, etc etc.\n  ","415346":"\n  sorta, yeah. however, i've always been good at organizing, delegating, compartmentalizing, etc etc. so big projects that may seem overwhelming at first are able to be broken down into segments, which makes them not as intimidating.\n  ","415347":"\n  no, i'm not superstitious at all. most superstitions come from old wives' tales and other things that have been passed down and distorted for generations.\n  ","415348":"\n  you're asking the totally wrong person, lol. i'm absolutely terrible at jogging -- when i exercise, i speed walk at the most.\n  ","415349":"\n  the only thing i really did today was go to work, lol. i only got home from work 30 minutes ago.\n  \n  however, i did write more of my fictional essay while on my lunch break !! i think i'm almost done with it, and then comes the hefty editing process.\n  ","415350":"\n  uh ... i really hope this is a random statement and something that *doesn't* have to do with flossing and brushing your teeth, lmao. if you think dental hygiene is an indication of hyperfeminity, then i am quite concerned for the state of your teeth.\n  ","415351":"\n  no, i don't assume that. if someone doesn't want to share pictures of themselves, then that usually means that they're insecure or they don't want other people to focus on their appearance when talking to them on social media.\n  \n  as for names, there are a lot of people i know who don't share their real name on the internet. it's simply a privacy concern.\n  ","415352":"\n  i normally floss first, and then brush my teeth afterwards. that way, the plaque or food is loosened and you can just brush them away when you're done flossing.\n  ","415353":"\n  my boyfriend is a healthy balance of all of those qualities.\n  ","415354":"\n  lately, it's been \"hallucinogenics\" by matt maeson.\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C2iWnPG52Vg\n

fetishes. that's your sexual orientation and gender identity. to compare being gay or trans with having a fetish downsizes the struggles gay and trans people endure.\n  ","415364":"\n  that doesn't mean that people with fetishes should be associated with the lgbtq+ community. that just means that your friend happens to be a lesbian while having a specific fetish that was outcasted by her community.\n  ","415365":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n  ","415366":"\n  because having a fetish and being a member of the lgbtq+ community are two entirely different things. you can be of any sexual

under my skin.\n  ","415368":"\n  ???\n  \n  fetishes are entirely sexual -- that's why they're called fetishes. and no, the idea of fetishes being somehow associated with the lgbtq+ community is

done, both in the past and currently, have been indications that he's prejudiced against people of other races.\n  ","415371":"\n  LOL, no -- it isn't a turn on for me at all. i just think it's disgusting how people will anonymously ask a stranger a question pertaining to their sex life in order to get their own rocks off. if you wouldn't ask a stranger on the street these types of questions, what makes you think it's acceptable or appropriate to ask a stranger on the internet ??\n  ","415372":"\n  most of the time, i'm honestly disgusted with myself. however, there are some

questions are worded in a variety of different ways. i've been on askfm since 2012 or so, so i've seen my fair share of tickling-based fetish questions.\n  ","415375":"\n  i wouldn't think so. i'm a fairly down-to-earth and easy-going person, and i think the only thing that would bother me is if the person i'm living with constantly makes a mess and doesn't clean up after themselves.\n  \n  as for myself, i always try to keep things tidy because it helps my mental health and i've always been pretty responsible. i think the only issue someone might have is that i go out about once per week

have a friend in australia whom i'd love to visit.\n  ","415391":"\n  considering i have a terrible memory, i've found that writing things down and taking photographs are great ways of remembering events, people, etc etc. i used to keep a journal, and i always take photos whenever i'm out because i like cherishing the memories i create with my friends and boyfriend.\n  ","415392":"\n  i don't really know what other people think of me because i've never cared to ask, sans obvious people such as my boyfriend. i would hope that most people would think of me as a compassionate, knowledgeable

people in the past, and i was horribly good at it too. i regret those decisions because i'm sure i hurt a lot of people, but at the time, i simply didn't care.\n  \n  manipulation is a terrible thing

personal mantra, and it's always helped me persevere in times of struggle. i would like to think that it would help someone else as well.\n  ","415396":"\n  i met chester bennington once when i was 11\/12 years old. however, i wish i could have met him again before he passed away. he was such a profound influence on me during my teenage years, and if it wasn't for him and his music, i likely wouldn't be alive today. i would thank him for all he's done for me over the years.\n  ","415397":"\n  i suppose green. i have a candle lit that's currently green and it smells like clover, moss, and pipe tobacco (it's supposed to resemble the shire). it calms me down.\n  ","415398":"\n  i wouldn't want to see into the future. that would probably give me too much anxiety, and i would rather live my life in the present moment as opposed to constantly thinking about the future.\n  \n  in that respect, i would rather change a former regret into something better.\n  ","415399":"\n  i don't think i would want to read anyone's mind tbh. people don't say everything they think for a reason, and it would make me too paranoid if i knew everything that someone was thinking.\n  ","415400":"\n  i

kiss goodbye before running out the door.\n  ","415427":"\n  not really, no. ideally, i would love to be living on my own or with my boyfriend, making money through freelance writing (although i don't mind my job at all), and caring for a bunch of pets.\n  ","415428":"\n  i've learned to be more mindful and live in the present moment instead of focusing too much on the past or the future. i've learned to be more grateful and express my appreciation for my boyfriend and close friends, and i've also learned that it's important to take time for yourself.\n  ","415429":"\n  i like shopping at stop & shop. they have a lot of all natural, organic foods that are generally low in price. my mother controls the food that comes into the house, so it's usually obvious things like milk, bread, and eggs, as well as k cups, chopped meat, pork, veggie burgers, frozen french fries, veggie chips and straws, oatmeal, pasta, etc etc.\n  ","415430":"\n  LOL. well if he had bad breath and smelled like

","415434":"\n  i never wanted to be a parent when i was younger because i disliked children. even these days, i'm still unsure of whether or not i want to be a parent.\n  \n  i would foster or adopt a child if i decide i wanted children and, for some reason, couldn't have any. there are a lot of older children and teenagers in the system who deserve a loving home.\n  ","415435":"\n  there's a local news channel for my region, which usually has a lot of local news as well as national\/global news. however, i generally don't watch the news -- i usually read articles on google news to get my information.\n  ","415436":"\n  yeah, i've been in one crash which ended up totaling my car. another driver blew through a stop sign while i was going down the street, and i couldn't swerve in time so i ended up T-boning him.\n  ","415437":"\n  i don't know if i'll even get much back this year for my taxes -- i was doing a lot of freelance work for a while which is untaxed per week & you pay back on taxes at the end of the year, so i wouldn't be surprised if i end up owing the IRS money.\n  ","415438":"\n  i've never played the lottery because i've always thought it was a waste of money.\n

childhood. however, i don't miss being a teenager at all. my memories of being a teenager are nothing but bad memories, and i was severely depressed & svicidal most of the time.\n  ","415441":"\n  i absolutely hate cleaning the bathroom. our bathroom is small, thankfully, but i use a cleaner mixed with bleach and the smell makes me so dizzy because of the fact that my bathroom is so small and we don't have ventilation in there.\n  ","415442":"\n  i want to be known for my writing, overall. i've been trying to write more in an attempt to get my name out there once i'm happy with what i've written, because you simply can't get published if you don't perfect your craft.\n  ","415443":"\n  they're not terrible where i live !! they're around $2.31 at the lowest price, and i can usually fill my tank with less than $25 if i'm on empty.\n  ","415444":"\n  my student loans. it's my most expensive bill.\n  ","415445":"\n  for the most part, yeah. i crave social interaction from time to time, but i can only tolerate being out for maybe 2-3 hours before i need to be alone again.\n  ","415446":"\n  no, i don't care about trolls. i normally delete their messages & don't give them a second thought.\n  ","415447":"\n  yeah, the area i live in frequently experiences nor'easters. it's generally a really bad snow storm where there's high winds, zero visibility, and anywhere between 6-24 inches of snow (if not more). we've had state of emergencies declared before as a result.\n  ","415448":"\n  sometimes !! we usually make empanadas together when we have the house to ourselves

going well so far. i've done really nothing besides drink coffee, listen to music, and work on some writing.\n  ","415457":"\n  no. although religion has its flaws and brings out the worst in people at times, it's also a coping mechanism for others and that shouldn't be taken away from them.\n  ","415458":"\n  i'm not sure. i don't really know what everyone else likes at the moment, especially considering groups of people are interested in things in phases. i don't care enough to follow those trends.\n  ","415459":"\n  generally, no. however, i am friends with a few people from askfm so when they write me with either accomplishments or struggles, then i totally empathize with them & that affects my mood.\n  ","415460":"\n  there isn't much i can do in that circumstance, so i just move on. you can't expect everyone to care about you or your feelings, and if someone simply doesn't care, then they're not important enough to be in your life at all.\n  ","415461":"\n  i haven't done much this weekend at all, and it's not even noon on sunday yet. yesterday, i spent most of my time sleeping and i played video games for a few hours.\n  \n  this morning has been more productive -- alongside drinking coffee, listening to music, and answering questions on askfm, i've also been writing. :'))\n  ","415462":"\n  i don't believe i've ever fought someone over a guy, no. when i was in high school, i generally liked people who didn't reciprocate those feelings, so it was never an issue that came up.\n  ","415463":"\n  sometimes, but it ultimately depends on my mood. i'm more tolerant some days to philosophical questions than other days. at the moment, i really don't feel like crunching my brain to answer philosophical questions, though.\n  ","415464":"\n  depends on the day. sometimes i don't eat anything, while other days i'll have some oatmeal or an egg sandwich. i also have been trying to eat yogurt or parfaits more often.\n  ","415465":"\n  (cont) of oppression have already been planted and have been growing for centuries, regardless of him, and the further back in history you go, generally the less open to change people are. unlike a good portion of the world today, most of those people unfortunately grew up with oppressive beliefs and to suggest otherwise would be ludicrous. if hitler fought for justice as opposed to oppression, he may not have even been elected as president because we are all so afraid of change and so stuck on punishment that we choose to go with punishable sameness than justified change. also, even if hitler did end up becoming president, the rest of the world most likely would not agree with their version of building the country back up. world war ii could very well be the war on equality as opposed to the war on jews. it was obviously much well said than this but it's always stuck with me. it really makes you think.\n  \n  --\n  \n  wow, thank you so much for sending this in !! that really does make you think

question similar to this yesterday, i believe.\n  \n  in short, i think there should be more push for better sex education in schools regarding sex itself, the idea of consent, birth control, infertility, STDs\/STIs, etc etc. i also believe that schools should introduce a mental wellness class that discusses depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, including how to effectively cope with negative feelings and reach out for help when you need it.\n  ","415468":"\n  korn is one of my favorite bands, actually !! i like their \"issues\" album overall, but my favorite song by them might be \"falling away from me.\"\n  ","415469":"\n  that's a difficult question to answer, considering how influential hitler was when it came to antisemitism and the outcome of world war II as a whole. there's such a domino effect when talking about hitler's regime that it's almost impossible to really fathom how the world would be if he either did not exist or fought for justice instead of oppression.\n  ","415470":"\n  i have a pimple on my cheek rn, which is aggravating me because it hasn't disappeared despite me washing my face often throughout the day.\n  ","415471":"\n  aw, thank you !! i love aesthetics sm.\n  ","415472":"\n  considering i already have a partner, i'll describe his qualities which have attracted me ;\n  \n  hard-working & diligent, compassionate to those who deserve compassion and animals, creative beyond belief (his drawings and paintings are incredible), honest and straightforward, humorous to the point where his humor is a bit controversial, intelligent in a variety of practice areas, unbelievably handy around the house and outdoors, steadfast in his opinions and beliefs, and loyal.\n  ","415473":"\n  i've probably already ingested about 20oz of coffee already this morning, so you're right on target, my friend.\n  ","415474":"\n  yes, as far as i can remember, she was.\n  ","415475":"\n  my hobbies include playing video games,

feel longer than anything else. i may forget exactly what people have said or done, but i don't usually forget how those words or actions made me feel in that moment or afterwards.\n  ","415478":"\n  i always enjoyed learning about world war II when i was in school. i just thought it was such an interesting time period to learn about, especially with respect to the psychology behind nazi germany and the experiments they would perform.\n  ","415479":"\n  i tend to notice people's changes in expression, even when it's just fleeting. when people are disappointed but they're too afraid to speak their feelings, or when they're angry and they're trying to suppress it.\n  \n  the other night, i noticed there was a feud going on between two girls at the bar over this one man who was giving them both attention. neither of my friends realized that there was friction between the two girls, but i picked up on the subtle hints and cues between them. i thought it was interesting from a bystander's perspective.\n  ","415480":"\n  most people i know seem more motivated when the weather is beautiful & sunny outside. however, i've always been more inspired when the weather is gray & dark, or when it's raining. i don't know why it inspires me more, but i always feel more like \"myself\" when the weather isn't at its best.\n  ","415481":"\n  the more knowledge you have, the more you realize that knowledge is limitless and there will always be things you don't know. i've noticed that most ignorant people seem to think they know *everything* while those who are more educated or intelligent realize that there will always be more to learn.\n  \n  i don't think there will ever be a boundary for curiosity, no. no matter how much we think we know, there will always be more for us to educate ourselves on.\n  ","415482":"\n  it's been the same in the united states, actually -- so far, this winter has been incredibly mild (we only got one bout of snow right before thanksgiving), but everyone has been getting sick left and right. there have been the measles outbreaks, as well as the flu, which have hospitalized a lot of people & i think a few people have died from it as well.\n  \n  i don't think i've managed to avoid getting sick because i think i'm sick rn, lmao. i've had congestion, sneezing, coughing, etc etc., for the past month at least. thankfully it isn't anything worse than that, though.\n  ","415483":"\n  i would probably travel to australia, or new zealand, or alaska -- somewhere i've never been before that i've always wanted to go to. all of these places just seem like such beautiful places from a tourist's perspective.\n  ","415484":"\n  the mountains have always been much more peaceful to me, as well as inspiring. when i lived in massachusetts, i lived in a region of the state where there were a lot of trees and mountains and hills, the college was situated right in the midst of a mountain range. it was honestly so inspiring for my writing, and i would often sneak out onto the roof of one of the lecture halls and watch the sun rise over the mountains if i was having a bad day.\n  ","415485":"\n  any money that i've spent on experiences, not necessarily material goods, have been the best investments i've ever made. things like concert tickets, plane and hotel tickets, convention tickets, vacations in upstate new york, etc etc.\n

morning.\n  ","415488":"\n  most sugar substitutes taste absolutely horrid to me, especially equal & splenda. my boyfriend takes his coffee with milk & two splenda, and i have no clue how he drinks his coffee that way because it's disgustingly sweet. each packet of splenda equals out to two packets of sugar.\n  \n  the only sugar substitute i actually enjoy is stevia. it tastes the most like sugar to me, and it's also all natural.\n  ","415489":"\n  right now, my favorite piece of jewelry is one of the necklaces my boyfriend got me for xmas. it's a rose gold tree pendant surrounded by a circle of opal. it's so beautiful and i wear it every day.\n  ","415490":"\n  lately i've been switching off between rose quartz & moonstone by bath and body works in terms of body spray. my boyfriend also gifted me a few mini bottles of victoria's secret body sprays, which smell lovely (my favorite is probably warm & cozy).\n  \n  my favorite body wash is dove's coconut & jasmine soap. it smells terrific. i also have been using a homemade soap that one of my high school friends made, it smells like pine.\n  ","415491":"\n  i don't cook very often, but i do help my parents with the cooking

so someone usually gets offended and makes a mess out of the entire holiday, which makes it really awkward for the rest of us.\n  \n  there was also a time i actually got into an argument with my grandmother over tattoos on christmas day, because she was insisting that tattoos are trashy and won't get you hired in the workplace. meanwhile, at that point, i already had multiple tattoos (and so did my cousins), so it was pretty demeaning.\n  ","415495":"\n  these days, most movies i watch don't really seem to capture my attention at all. something really needs to be riveting and filled with suspense in order for me to be interested in it.\n  ","415496":"\n  i prefer the forest. i've lived close to the ocean my entire life, and i've never been all that amazed by it, especially considering

disagree, lol. however, i'm not religious and i don't believe in the concept of sin in the first place, so that's why i don't think being part of the lgbtq+ community is sinful. people can't help

sweaters and cardigans, knee-high boots, scarves and beanies, and floral prints, so i'd say it could also be somewhat boho chic at times.\n  ","415506":"\n  i would love to learn how to sing properly.

tbh. the only color i haven't dyed my hair has been green, but i want to do an emerald green next after the blue dye fades out.\n  \n  not only have i had a variety of colors, but i've also had different types of highlights & lowlights with those colors with various combinations, i.e. red and black, purple and pink, brown and dark red, blonde and red, etc etc.\n  ","415508":"\n  i have seven

re-take their driving test every 10-15 years or so. there are so many people who shouldn't be on the road and i think it would make the roads a lot safer if people had to re-take their tests again after they hit a certain age.\n  ","415510":"\n  i'm really passionate about learning & education in general. when i was in college, i really liked learning about the social sciences, i.e. criminology, anthropology, sociology, and psychology. if i didn't get my degree in communications, i would have gotten a degree in any of those fields.\n  \n  i prefer hands-on learning and lectures

as it turns out, but i was at work a few weeks ago & my boyfriend called me in a panic because he couldn't find his dog. he searched all over the house, in all of the hiding spots in the backyard, etc etc. he didn't know what to do, so i told him to call some of his neighbors and his grandmother (she lives next door) to see if maybe he wandered off over there.\n  \n  we hung up, and he called me

actually teaches children and teenagers about sex, birth control, and reproductive health.\n  \n  i would also implement a mental wellness class that discusses mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety, as well as how to properly discuss mental health with friends or authorities (such as parents or teachers) and reach out when you're in need of help.\n  ","415516":"\n  i suppose the last meaningful thing i did was prepare dinner for my parents earlier, if that counts for anything.\n  ","415517":"\n  i have the tendency to be spiteful when it comes to certain people in my life, but i've been trying to quell those tendencies because they're toxic and unhealthy and don't serve me at all.\n  ","415518":"\n  the only \"expensive\" thing i've ever found on the ground was a $20 bill, lol. i was a teenager, so naturally it seemed like a lot of money back then.\n  ","415519":"\n  it's starting to be that way again, lol. i've been getting at least one coffee-related question per day lately.\n  ","415520":"\n  social media is both brilliant and toxic, depending on how you use it and who you choose to follow. on the one hand, social media can be a great educational tool and it's amazing how fast news travels via social media. there's really no reason for people *not* to be abreast of developments in current events.\n  \n  however, at the same time, it can be problematic if you associate yourself or follow the wrong crowd, and herd mentality definitely has the tendency to develop over time. on askfm especially, there has always been this pressure to believe in certain things & act certain ways in order to fit in with the crowd you're following to vie for their attention, and sometimes people feed off of each other too much to the point where it can be unhealthy.\n  ","415521":"\n  i only own the sweet peach palette & the pumpkin spice palette, but the pumpkin spice palette is *amazing.* the colors are so rich, and i'm looking forward to experimenting more with

seem that much more prominent.\n  ","415525":"\n  i had a 12oz cup of hot coffee this morning, but i didn't finished it because i ended up taking a nap. then i made a glass of iced coffee, so i'm not sure how many ounces that was. i'm now drinking a third cup of coffee, also iced.\n  ","415526":"\n  i used to play GTA V a lot with my friends, but we haven't played it together in quite a while.\n

","415529":"\n  no, i'm fairly easy going when it comes to most things. i only get angry when something is my fault, at which point i obviously get angry at myself, and i'm pretty forgiving or indifferent when it comes to most other people.\n  ","415530":"\n  quite the opposite actually. stay at home mothers have to watch about the child(ren) as well as probably do most of the housework and cooking, which is a lot of work around the clock. they're definitely the furthest thing from being lazy unless they're not properly taking care of their children or abandoning household chores.\n

the last time i weighed myself.\n  ","415534":"\n  surprisingly, i'm most productive on mondays.\n  \n  i notice that after i'm off for the weekend, i go back into work with a fresh state of mind and i'm more motivated to complete assignments because i don't feel as burnt out as i usually do the rest of the week.\n  ","415535":"\n  blue -- calm, collected, and pensive. i'm thinking about what i want to do today, but i'm also content with just staying home and catching up on video games & laundry all day.\n  ","415536":"\n  i've been to plenty of concerts !! most recently, i attended alt92.3's not so silent night at the barclays center in brooklyn, and the performers were AJR, bastille, mike shinoda, chvrches, florence and the machine, death cab for cutie, and muse (among others).\n  \n  last summer, i also saw macklemore and kesha. in the years before that, i've also seen alice in chains, stone temple pilots, linkin park, chris cornell, korn, and a few other rock bands.\n  ","415537":"\n  even though this selfie is like a year old at this point, i still love it and i'll use it as a profile picture every now and again.\n  ","415538":"\n  i've never moved across

most games i play, and lately, i've been obsessed with fallout 76. it's definitely not as terrible of a game as critics are making it out to be, and i'm thoroughly enjoying the gameplay and quests and enemies. it's a lot more challenging than the previous games.\n  \n  before i started playing fallout 76, i was obsessed with fallout 4 and skyrim.\n  ","415540":"\n  people are swayed by both to a degree, but i believe that business advertisements have the ability to sway people more, simply because society in general pays more attention to the media and advertisements than they do politicians.\n  ","415541":"\n  even though i was never a fan of physical education, i still think it's important to keep those classes in schools just for the sake of giving children a reason to run around and play sports for 30-40 minutes. everyone needs to be physically active, minus those with physical disabilities and such, and it's healthy to implement physical education in order to keep kids active.\n  ","415542":"\n  it is and it isn't, which sounds confusing. half of the population in my area are black people and latinos, while there are also still older white people from the earlier generations who still live here. i've noticed that the older white folk are extremely racist, but that's the only demographic that pretty much is.\n  ","415543":"\n  i don't personally think so, no. i can barely tolerate my own life sometimes & i still have a lot of issues with my mental health, so i don't think i would be qualified to be a life coach when i can't even get my own life together.\n  ","415544":"\n  no, i don't believe i was happier four months ago. tbh i don't really remember what was going on in my life four months ago, but i do know that i've been approaching 2019

entirely on how i'm feeling that day, tbh. some days i have more tolerance than others. most of the time, i think i'd say that i don't get fed up easily because i do have a lot of patience, but there are other times where my patience is at zero.\n  ","415547":"\n  you're asking the completely wrong person, my dude. lmao. i haven't flirted with anyone besides my boyfriend in basically ten years.\n  ","415548":"\n  no, you're mostly incorrect. some people have the tendency to dwell on their first loves because they believe that they were the \"best\" love, but a lot of people seem to have the opposite thought.\n  \n  my first love certainly wasn't my best love, and i've learned a lot about relationships since then. the first love is generally one of the greatest learning experiences.\n

favorite food. it's so versatile, and i'm never in a mood where i *don't* want sushi.\n  ","415553":"\n  pretty much any show i watch is binge-watched, lol. i'm currently binge-watching you on netflix

never smoked meth before.\n  ","415555":"\n  yes, i've smoked weed before.\n  ","415556":"\n  pretty much any song by hobo johnson.\n  ","415557":"\n  the only person i feel comfortable sleeping next to is my boyfriend.\n  ","415558":"\n  i've made a few friends on askfm, but it wasn't the reason why i joined the site years ago.\n  \n  i was also talking about IRL in my previous answer, not my online activities.\n  ","415559":"\n  no, i don't make friends easily because i'm never in a position where there's an opportunity to make friends. i'm fine with that, though. i only have a few friends and i'm content with the people i talk to on a regular basis.\n  ","415560":"\n  if someone tries to start something with me, then i'll inform them that i'm not involving myself in their drama

now.\n  ","415565":"\n  no, i generally avoid confrontation.\n  ","415566":"\n  idk, i've been fascinated with them since i was a child. it isn't something that erupted for a concise reason, it's just always been there.\n  ","415567":"\n  i'm guessing they're your coworkers or classmates or something ??\n  \n  tbh i would just try again. make it clear to them that you won't put up with what they're saying about you, even if they're allegedly \"joking.\" if that makes you a sensitive person, then so be it. you need to do what you have to do to feel comfortable in your space, especially considering you see these people every day.\n  ","415568":"\n  depends on what subtype of feminism you're talking about. white feminism is absolutely horrid and has done worse things for women in general, and as a result of the new wave feminism movement, many people simply don't take feminism seriously anymore since its viewed these days as a trend.\n  \n  intersectional feminism is great in theory, but again -- it's become a trend, which is terrible considering people have been spreading misinformation regarding intersectional feminism ever since it got on the popular radar.\n  \n  feminism used to be so radical, revolutionary, and good for implementing change in the past, i.e. the 1960s-80s. but these days, not so much. people are more apt to sit behind their keyboard and spew misinformation as opposed to being proactive with their \"activism\" and trying to advocate on behalf of women.\n  ","415569":"\n  i would probably tell them that they were hurting my feelings, even though they claim that they were just joking. sometimes people can be sensitive to certain things even in jest, so i would be up front with them about it and make it clear that it makes you uncomfortable when they joke about things about you.\n  ","415570":"\n  no, i only need to wash my hair 2-3 times per week.\n  ","415571":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry !! thanks for the follow, though ~~\n  ","415572":"\n  no, although i've never actually tried before. however, i have no sense of balance so i can't imagine that working out well for me.\n  ","415573":"\n  my day went well. tech support ended up upgrading the software in everyone's computers this afternoon, so i had a nice break while waiting for the upgrade to finish, lol.\n  \n  i don't have plans for this weekend, but i might go out with a friend tonight.\n  ","415574":"\n  i have quite a few bad memories, sure.\n  ","415575":"\n  prior to my current job, i worked in retail and at a law firm.\n

lol. i mainly watched adult swim those days.\n  ","415578":"\n  no. the last time i watched either of those channels was when i was in high school.\n  ","415579":"\n  no, it doesn't interfere with my sleep at all actually. i suppose my body has just gotten used to it over time, since i've been drinking coffee at night for quite a while now.\n  ","415580":"\n  if they do, they thankfully don't give any indication that they do.\n  ","415581":"\n  i'm drinking coffee, listening to music, and answering questions on askfm (my nightly ritual, it seems).\n  ","415582":"\n  i usually don't come into contact with men who are flirtatious, lol.\n  ","415583":"\n  i suppose it depends on her intentions. is she flirting with you because she likes you, or are her actions done unconsciously because it's simply part of who she is ?? some people are just naturally flirty and they have no real motive behind how they're acting, it's simply just the way they are.\n  ","415584":"\n  much like what everyone else in response to this question, it can go either way. there isn't a proper way to say such a thing, it's just whatever you prefer.\n  ","415585":"\n  i already track the time it takes for me to complete activities at work, and it's a bit of a source of inspiration for me to work more quickly and efficiently. i have to fill out a timesheet every day of the work i completed each hour, so it's a good challenge for me to see how much i can do in one day and compare it to previous days.\n  ","415586":"\n  i really can't think of any job where you aren't obligated to keep some sort of calendar. even with freelance jobs, you have deadlines to keep in mind even if you aren't necessarily commuting to an office every day, and deadlines are calendar dates in themselves.\n  ","415587":"\n  i'll try to answer your question, sure. but i can't necessarily guarantee that i'll have a good answer.\n  ","415588":"\n  i wouldn't take myself anywhere because it's dangerous in my area to go to most places alone unless it's somewhere like the grocery store or pharmacy.\n  ","415589":"\n  sushi !! i literally cannot think of a time when i *don't* want sushi, lol. my favorite is the spicy tuna roll, but i also love salmon avocado rolls and veggie tempura rolls.\n  ","415590":"\n  i don't post full body photos on askfm, so this assumption is unfounded.\n  \n  there's also nothing inherently wrong with being called fat, especially if i'm the person calling myself fat. it's something i'm attempting to change, and the first step to changing it is acknowledging that i have excessive body weight.\n  ","415591":"\n  my boyfriend. i could function if i lost all of my friends, but i would be at a complete loss if my boyfriend left or passed away. it's something i can't even fathom experiencing.\n  ","415592":"\n  meeeee.\n  ","415593":"\n  yes, i believe that people can change out of love. when you're truly in love with someone and that feeling is reciprocated, then you can be inspired to change your bad\/toxic behaviors and habits in an effort to make yourself a better individual. we're constantly evolving as humans as it is, and experiencing love can be the fuel that triggers change.\n  ","415594":"\n  i think they have a grave misunderstanding of the services that planned parenthood actually provides, ranging from birth control and STD\/STI testing to things such as pap smears, cancer screenings, hormone therapy and infertility treatment.\n  \n  if someone believes that a medical service shouldn't be funded when a large majority of their services include the aforementioned things, then i can only assume that individual doesn't want people with uteruses to obtain proper medical care.\n  ","415595":"\n  this morning i was disappointed that i only purchased a 16oz hot coffee instead of a 20oz hot coffee. i managed to drink the entire cup in maybe 30-40 minutes in between working on assignments.\n  ","415596":"\n  yeah, when it's warranted at least. i'm not mean unless someone has said something that deserves a mean reply. i'm not mean for absolutely no reason.\n  ","415597":"\n  yeah, i've kissed girls before.\n  ","415598":"\n  i love mai tais, blue hawaiians, and espresso martinis.\n  ","415599":"\n  yeah, i smoke occasionally.\n  ","415600":"\n  mixing alcohol with energy drinks is dangerous, imo. that's why i stopped drinking red bull-vodkas, even though i enjoyed them. they're just too dangerous.\n  \n  you can mix malibu with almost anything, though. pineapple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice, etc etc.\n  ","415601":"\n  i don't remember the last thing i legitimately broke, because it's been quite a while since i've been that angry, but i *almost* broke my xbox controller a few months ago when my

at lunch today while i was at work.\n  ","415607":"\n  no, i don't think i'm more mature than other people my age. i'd say that my maturity level equals out to the same as other people in my age bracket (i.e. 25-30 years old).\n  \n  age can define one's maturity to a degree, but it can also be based on life experiences and the idea that a person may have been forced to \"grow up\" at a younger age than some of their peers. when i was younger, i would have said that i was more mature than my peers because i didn't have a genuine childhood, but these days, i would say i'm more or less the same maturity as everyone else.\n  ","415608":"\n  like ... so many questions can be answered if someone reads my bio, lmao. i don't understand why people don't look at bios when they're on

atheists either aren't religious at all or completely reject the idea of religion.\n  \n  i'm an athiest, personally. however, i do understand that religion often helps people so i don't reject religion entirely. i've just never been a religious person & i don't believe in god.\n  ","415614":"\n  hello -- i'm doing well. i'm just eating dinner now & then i'm debating on watching netflix or playing video games.\n  ","415615":"\n  i reorganized the shelf above my bed last week & it looks so pretty.\n  ","415616":"\n  it depends on the day. usually i only drink a large coffee in the

bed despite the fact that you'll be late for work, lmao.\n  ","415620":"\n  i don't watch anime, but i do love studio ghibli films, i.e. kiki's delivery service, spirited away, and howl's moving castle.\n  ","415621":"\n  yes, i've had three serious relationships. they're pretty much the only relationships i've ever been in as well.\n  ","415622":"\n  i would choose to feel no fear. anxiety and fear go hand-in-hand, and if i were to quell my fears, then i would likely quell any anxiety that i experience on a regular basis, such as when i'm driving or talking to people.\n  ","415623":"\n  i would tell my younger self that what they're feeling is completely valid, and that they're not losing their mind. what happened to them was real and unforgiving, and it's going to take years upon years to come to terms with it, but they're going to survive and make a life worth living.\n  ","415624":"\n  it depends on a variety of things, i.e. who's talking to me, the mood i'm in, how exhausted i am, etc etc. for the most part, i am an active listener, but sometimes i do drift off and realize that i stopped listening -- at which point, i have to ask the person to repeat themselves,

","415626":"\n  no, i think that's a false stereotype. technology has advanced so much in the past decade or so that it's only enhanced our abilities to complete tasks in a more efficient manner. in addition, it's also much easier to obtain information regarding virtually anything you want to learn about. if anything, technology has made humanity more proactive.\n  ","415627":"\n  i don't generally think about people who are like that overall. if someone thinks they're \"better\" than they actually are, in that they believe they're a good or righteous person when they're anything but,

that voiced over different EDM and dance songs.\n  ","415629":"\n  LOL, no. it's only 12 ounces. i made it at home, i didn't purchase it.\n  ","415630":"\n  i haven't heard of crazy frog in 10 years, my dude. talk about a blast from the past.\n  ","415631":"\n  i prefer headphones. earbuds always fall out of my ears and i can still hear noise around me with them in. headphones allow for a more immersive experience.\n  ","415632":"\n  nothing much has gone on today really. i woke up with my boyfriend this morning (he actually woke up with me instead of sleeping in, aw), and then i went to work. after work, i attended my therapy appointment, and then i went home.\n  \n  i've just been sipping on a cup of coffee, listening to music, and answering questions since i've been home. i'm probably going to eat dinner soon, and then later tonight, my boyfriend and i have an xbox date with fallout 76. :'))\n  ","415633":"\n  i didn't have a topic that i dreaded writing about. i loved writing about nearly anything i could get my hands on, because not only was it easy for me to express my opinions and understanding of the material, but writing about the material also gave me a more in-depth perspective of what i was learning.\n  ","415634":"\n  i broke up with my ex because he ended up lying to me, was keeping things from me, and was generally acting really shady. i later found out he cheated on me, so it was for the best.\n  ","415635":"\n  a more in-depth reporting\/blocking system would really do askfm wonders. often people who are undeserving of being reported or banned get reported & banned, and those who are complete nuisances and break every single rule\/guideline somehow can still make accounts. i think askfm should implement an IP ban.\n  ","415636":"\n  apparently i'm good at interviews, considering i've been offered a job with every interview i've gone on before !! i suppose i do a good job at suppressing my emotions and anxiety when i go on job interviews, because normally i'm panicking but i've never been told that i looked anxious.\n  ","415637":"\n  unfortunately, i've never been able to lucid dream before. i've always wanted to, but my dreams are absolutely wild and i always believe they're real. it takes me a few minutes to understand reality when i wake up in the morning.\n  ","415638":"\n  i will be driving a car at 5pm, so that's likely not the best idea.\n  ","415639":"\n  nails scraping on chalkboards. the squeak of slippery fruit against clean teeth. people chewing with their mouth open.\n  ","415640":"\n  i used to worry about that in the past, but these days, not so much. if someone dislikes me, it's likely because they simply don't know me, and i would rather not get to know a person if they base their opinions of someone off of what they've been told by someone else. that's essentially herd mentality.\n  ","415641":"\n  LOL, yes. when i was a teenager, i was convinced i was going to be this renowned, terrific writer ... it wasn't until i entered college that i realized that it was going to be a hell of a lot of work, and although i still have dreams of being a great writer, they're somewhat distant dreams at this point.\n  ","415642":"\n  \"if you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n  \n  it's always been a source of inspiration for me, that no matter how far down you've gone, you can always crawl out of the hole and build yourself back up again.\n  ","415643":"\n  eggs have a very distinct odor, i've come to notice. it can be both a good and bad thing, because sometimes they smell really good and other times it smells absolutely horrid to me.\n  ","415644":"\n  i passed my driving test on my second attempt. i failed my first attempt because i got nervous and couldn't parallel park correctly.\n  ","415645":"\n  yes, on multiple occasions, unfortunately. they would act as if my feelings didn't matter & that their feelings were the most important thing for me to account for, even if i didn't necessarily do anything wrong.\n  ","415646":"\n  friendship. i don't become friends with people easily, but when i do, they're long-lasting friendships. i've been friends with my best friend for 15 years, and my other closest friend besides her, i've been friends with her for 7 years.\n  ","415647":"\n  yes, i've been driving since i was 19 years old.\n  ","415648":"\n  the last thing i did before i went to bed last night was cuddle with my boyfriend. that was the last thing i remember before falling asleep.\n  ","415649":"\n  just stop talking to them. if there's a person i dislike in my life then i have no issue in removing that person, whether it's by simply not talking to them anymore or deleting them off of social media.\n  ","415650":"\n  does my therapy appointment count ?? lmao.\n  \n  if not, then i bought an americano this afternoon after lunch.\n  ","415651":"\n  yes, definitely. pubs are just standard bars that maybe have a jukebox or a billiards table, but they're mostly just a bar with different seating inside. i always go to pubs, never again will i go to a club.\n  ","415652":"\n  no, i've never texted an ex partner or an ex friend after we drifted apart. i have no desire to talk to anyone like that anymore.\n  ","415653":"\n  pubs, definitely. i've only ever been to an actual club twice, and the first time i went, i ended up having a panic attack and spent the evening outside in the rain because i was trying to calm myself down.\n  ","415654":"\n  i just got home from therapy, so now i'm going to make a cup of coffee and relax for a while.\n  ","415655":"\n  no, i'm in a relationship.\n  ","415656":"\n  hello -- it's the evening where i live. do you have a question ??\n  ","415657":"\n  i don't know whether or not i want children in the future. i'm very torn on the subject.\n  ","415658":"\n  not really, no. i only ever feel nauseous when i have too much dairy, which is part of the reason why i've been limiting my diary intake lately.\n  ","415659":"\n  i don't pay rent at my parents' house, but i do contribute to grocery shopping and i do all of the cleaning in the house.\n  ","415660":"\n  no, i have just enough money to be comfortable at the moment. i'm eyeing a potential raise in my future, though.\n  ","415661":"\n  both are cute, but i love my boyfriend's dimples so much.\n  ","415662":"\n  lol, i go to dive bars but that's basically it. there are really only maybe three places i frequent but they're all relatively quiet on the weekdays, which is why i go there.\n  ","415663":"\n  mostly open world RPGs and FPS games. i've been playing fallout 76 a lot lately, but i also enjoy fallout 4 and skyrim, destiny 1 and 2, the assassin's creed games, the tomb raider games, the bioshock series, life is strange, the wolf among us, minecraft, etc etc.\n  ","415664":"\n  i'd politely decline. i'm not single, but even if i was, i probably wouldn't be down to giving some random stranger my phone number or social media handle.\n  ","415665":"\n  i don't remember. i'm sure i saw at least one when i was much younger, but i can't really remember that far back into the past.\n  ","415666":"\n  god forbid i answer the questions people ask me, lol. if you have an issue with how many coins i have, then perhaps stop asking me questions.\n  ","415667":"\n  no, i don't like playing COD. however, i've watched\n  \n   @Courrtana\n  \n  stream it a few times !!\n  ","415668":"\n  i don't remember my childhood, so i honestly have no idea.\n  ","415669":"\n  i've been at work all day, my dude.\n  ","415670":"\n  no, i've never watched death note before.\n  ","415671":"\n  10416 coins.\n  ","415672":"\n  i'm not in panic mode like i was yesterday, but i'm still somewhat under the weather and completely exhausted.\n  ","415673":"\n  i thought about it, but i can't justify spending that kind of money rn. i've also never taken an online class before so idk if i would like it.\n  ","415674":"\n  yeah, but nothing compares to going to a lecture with a knowledgable professor and sitting there taking notes and learning new things for 45-90 minutes with no interruption.\n  ","415675":"\n  no problem !! also i just realized that its called everpure, not everstrong. i think everstrong is for the thickening shampoo and everpure is for color treated hair. it's a red\/pink bottle.\n  ","415676":"\n  education. i feel like my intelligence has gone stagnant because i haven't been in college for five years, and sometimes i wish i could enroll in school again and learn things every day like i used to.\n  ","415677":"\n  i don't need positive reinforcement, but i do enjoy it when it comes from certain people (my boyfriend, close friends, and my boss). sometimes it's nice to feel validated and know that you're doing a good job.\n  ","415678":"\n  lol, i've never threatened to beat someone up. but i have been forced to be tough with people to the point where i would simply insult them if they were rude to me first and wouldn't listen to reason.\n  ","415679":"\n  ruffles cheddar and sour cream.\n  ","415680":"\n  i don't watch the same video over and over again. however, i watch achievement hunter's content the most so i'm sure there are some videos i've seen multiple times.\n  \n  i also used to love when seananners was active on youtube. i'll watch his old videos again occasionally.\n  ","415681":"\n  i would go back to school and study either psychology or sociology. when i was in college, i debated on changing my major to sociology because i enjoyed the subject so much.\n  \n  as for which college, i really have no idea. probably somewhere like brown university or columbia university.\n  ","415682":"\n  yeah, i use snapchat. i don't usually get streaks because i don't send people snaps every day, and i don't add things to my story either.\n  ","415683":"\n  ideally i would like to be a freelance writer, but those jobs often don't pay the bills. i'm content where i am rn. it's within the field i went to college for, so i have no complaints.\n  ","415684":"\n  a call center representative or a sales representative. basically any job where i have to talk to people for a living.\n  \n  i have social anxiety and i absolutely hate talking on the phone (except obviously when it's my boyfriend). i'm used to being around customers since i worked retail for 4 years, but it made me so nervous and anxious.\n  ","415685":"\n  i'm a writer\/editor for a publishing company.\n  ","415686":"\n  i've been on askfm since maybe 2011 or so. i remember answering questions when i was in college.\n  \n  right now, i have 4338 followers. however, i've had three accounts since 2011 and i only made this account maybe almost two years ago.\n  ","415687":"\n  i received my driver's license when i was 19 years old. i think i failed the first time i took my driving test, but i passed the second time.\n  ","415688":"\n  yes, lmao. the most random and obscure things make me cry.\n  ","415689":"\n  my day has been fine -- a lot better than yesterday, at least. i had motivation to finish my work and i stopped by 7-11 to pick up coffee and cigarettes, so i'm pretty content rn.\n  \n  i'm eating dinner and then i'm going to head to my boyfriend's house since i haven't seen him in a few days.\n  ","415690":"\n  lol, no. the only times i'm a looter & a thief is when i'm playing video games.\n  ","415691":"\n  ahh thank you !! i use the l'oreal everstrong sulfate-free shampoo & conditioner. the one that smells like rosemary and mint.\n  ","415692":"\n  yeah, it helps a lot when i have congestion or a cold\/flu.\n  ","415693":"\n  why ?? and why is he a \"poor\" man if his spouse had a nose she was previously unhappy with ?? y'all place too much importance on physical appearances.\n  ","415694":"\n  \"the fireman\" by joe hill & \"i am not a serial killer\" by dan wells.\n  ","415695":"\n  my back pain has been tolerable lately, but i still have the urge to stretch and crack it every 20 minutes.\n  ","415696":"\n  how would that be lying ?? lying would be saying you haven't had plastic surgery when you have, lol.\n  \n  i don't really see the big deal in keeping some things to yourself unless it's an issue. i feel like that's one of those topics that would just be brought up casually in conversation.\n  ","415697":"\n  not really, no.\n  ","415698":"\n  yeah, i have a medication that i take for anxiety that's as needed.\n  ","415699":"\n  i think i only read like two books, lol.\n  ","415700":"\n  i like moderately spicy food, but nothing too hot.\n  ","415701":"\n  it isn't something that happens consciously. it just tends to happen through life experience.\n  ","415702":"\n  the woman who was in a coma or something ?? i heard about it but didn't bother to read any articles on it.\n  ","415703":"\n  i went to work, came home, and made a cup of coffee. i'm watching netflix now.\n  ","415704":"\n  non-binary simply means you're not one of the binaries of gender (man or woman). your gender is somewhere on the spectrum, but you don't exclusively identify as either a man or a woman.\n  ","415705":"\n  you're not obligated to tell them, no. if it's something personal to you and you don't feel comfortable sharing, then it isn't as if you *must* tell them right away or at all, for that matter.\n  ","415706":"\n  overall, yeah there's more activity. i think the original anon meant that it's dead at the moment, which is the same for me rn.\n  ","415707":"\n  it happens sometimes.\n  ","415708":"\n  anyone have any questions ??\n  ","415709":"\n  i've just been drinking coffee and checking up on social media, trying to relax. my anxiety isn't as bad as it was before when i was at work, but it's still there.\n  ","415710":"\n  when i'm at work, yes. LOL. time tends to go by super slow when i'm working, unless i'm heavily involved in a specific project that i actually enjoy doing.\n  ","415711":"\n  no, probably not. like scuba diving, it's never been something that i've been interested in doing.\n  ","415712":"\n  sometimes i am, yeah. it depends entirely on my mood that day, though.\n  ","415713":"\n  it isn't really something i've ever been interested in doing.\n  ","415714":"\n  i already said that i have no importance to society, so no.\n  ","415715":"\n  step out of your comfort zone & do something you've always wanted to do but were previously afraid. take responsible risks if you know that there's a chance of a better outcome, and even if you fail, be content with the knowledge that at least you tried. scrap the dirt off your knees and try again, or approach it in a different manner.\n  ","415716":"\n  people who make a genuine difference in the world, i.e. scientists, professors and teachers, politicians (even though most of them don't have positive significance), attorneys, etc etc.\n  ","415717":"\n  it's a pretty self-evident statement. i'm not important means that i'm not of any significance to society.\n  ","415718":"\n  my opinion of someone would change if i found out that they supported something that i was vehemently against, especially in cases where they don't support lgbtq+ rights, women's rights, people of color, etc etc. if a found out that a friend of mine was racist or sexist or whatever, then i would probably stop being friends with them.\n  ","415719":"\n  it isn't worth it to be afraid when what you have to do will change you or your situation for the better. it's justified to be afraid of big changes and there's nothing wrong with it (in fact, it's expected in most cases), but it isn't worth holding yourself back in fear. you'll be better off in the long run.\n  ","415720":"\n  i'm spontaneous, especially since i don't know how i'm going to feel about a plan in the future. i tend to ask friends if they want to hang out a few hours before actually hanging out, if they happen to be available that night.\n  ","415721":"\n  i treated myself to an iced coffee when i got home from work because it makes me feel better when i have a bad day.\n  ","415722":"\n  i don't have a position in society and i'm not important, so this question doesn't exactly apply to me.\n  ","415723":"\n  not everyone, no. most people do, though.\n  ","415724":"\n  the mind is different from the body, in my perspective at least. however, the mind can have effects on the body -- i.e., my anxiety causes me a lot of digestive problems, and then there are the obvious physical symptoms of anxiety attacks and panic attacks.\n  ","415725":"\n  i would ask them how much money and when could they pay me back.\n  ","415726":"\n  my anxiety has been acting up again for some reason. i don't know if it's because there are some stressors in my life these days or because i need a stronger dose of anti-anxiety medication, though. i've been on the same dosage for a while, and it wouldn't surprise me if my body simply got used to it.\n  ","415727":"\n  i've started eating healthier again, i.e. more vegetables instead of carbs, fish instead of red meat, and less dairy.\n  ","415728":"\n  when everything seems to be going wrong, i try to rationalize it to myself by saying that at least the only thing that can happen now is for things to get better. when you're at rock bottom, the only way you can go is up.\n  ","415729":"\n  my bedroom or my boyfriend's house. whenever i go over his house, it feels like a small vacation because i'm away from my family and i'm free to do whatever i want to do. even though my bedroom is somewhat of an escape for me as well, i'm constantly being interrupted.\n  ","415730":"\n  lately, my fish tank is not being used. ever since my fish died, i haven't decided on whether or not i want to have more fish, so i've just been maintaining the tank until i make a decision.\n  ","415731":"\n  i agree. they had a follow up question, but i deleted it.\n  ","415732":"\n  probably a combination of the stress associated with the new material i'm learning at work, my exhaustion because i didn't sleep well last night, and my mind racing because that's generally how my brain behaves. sometimes there isn't necessarily a reason behind anxiety either. i often have bouts of anxiety with no real reason behind it at all.\n  ","415733":"\n  i used to be extremely creative in that i would always be drawing, painting, writing, doing photography, etc etc. these days, i haven't had the time or motivation to really delve into those hobbies, although i have been trying to write every day.\n  ","415734":"\n  hopeful for the future, mainly. i don't hold quite a pessimistic outlook on myself or my future, whereas when i feel hopeless, i feel as if there's no point in anything i'm doing, my future is bleak, and that i don't deserve to live.\n  ","415735":"\n  yeah, i've tasted blood before.\n  ","415736":"\n  no, my day was difficult and aggravating. my anxiety started acting up after lunch, and i didn't have any of my anti-anxiety pills on me, so i couldn't focus on my work and i started getting extremely overwhelmed. i ended up leaving an hour early because i felt awful.\n  ","415737":"\n  i used to watch toonami on adult swim when i was much younger, but that was pretty much it.\n  ","415738":"\n  my family members severely alter my mood and can really ruin my day if something happens or someone berates or yells at me, especially if it's through text message in the middle of the day when i'm not even home.\n  \n  it happens at least twice a month, unfortunately.\n  ","415739":"\n  when my life is going okay, my mental health is a lot better. i don't experience much anxiety and my depression doesn't flare up as often. i find myself feeling motivated and hopeful as opposed to hopeless and exhausted.\n  ","415740":"\n  not really, no. sometimes my mind is too active & it makes me paranoid, but i do sleep better in the darkness.\n  ","415741":"\n  i drink way too much coffee, it's probably pretty unhealthy.\n  ","415742":"\n  i'm the same person that i am when people *are* watching, although perhaps a bit more sloppy and lazy. i see no reason to put on a facade in front of other people, it seems exhausting.\n  ","415743":"\n  lol, i believe i did.\n  ","415744":"\n  somewhat, yeah. sometimes it's difficult for me to find motivation in the morning, but eventually i get back into the routine.\n  ","415745":"\n  no, i don't watch anime.\n  ","415746":"\n  nah, not everything. i tell him about what i do at work sometimes, but i don't bother telling him my conversations with my coworkers or anything like that. i don't tell him about most things regarding askfm either. occasionally, i'll tell him about a funny interaction or ask his opinion on a question if it makes me think, but that's it.\n  ","415747":"\n  i've always been more of a book person. in most cases, i prefer the book over the movie especially since movie adaptations of books often leave out crucial information or alter timelines.\n  ","415748":"\n  i try to do at least one small thing for myself every day, whether that's simply sitting down with a cup of coffee & quietly listening to music in order to relax, or treating myself to one of my favorite treats.\n  ","415749":"\n  it depends entirely on the individual. it's difficult to really class people based on sex because everyone's personalities are so different. i think my friend clint is pretty equal in regards to males versus females.\n  ","415750":"\n  my physical appearance, mostly. i would also enjoy if i didn't take what people in my life say closely to heart, because often i can act irrationally in response to things and think too deeply into what they might mean.\n  ","415751":"\n  you're under no obligation to tell your partner every single, little thing going on in your life. while that works for some people, it definitely doesn't work for everyone & i can understand some people wanting to keep certain things to themselves that not even their partner knows about.\n  ","415752":"\n  i have plenty of hobbies, lol. god forbid i feel like answering questions on askfm when i'm home from work.\n  ","415753":"\n  ^^\n  \n  thank you, anon !!\n  ","415754":"\n  obviously not considering i've been answering questions non-stop for nearly three hours straight.\n  ","415755":"\n  i don't remember. this is going back to when i was like 14 years old.\n  ","415756":"\n  yes !! that pretty much defined my early internet days -- i would talk to people on message boards and wouldn't know what they looked like until years later when we all migrated to another social media site, i.e. myspace or facebook.\n  ","415757":"\n  one all-time favorite song ?? no.\n  \n  however, i've been listening to \"hallucinogenics\" by matt maeson nonstop, so i suppose that's my *current* favorite song.\n  ","415758":"\n  it's been fairly low these days tbh.\n  ","415759":"\n  the only people's attention i truly value are the attentions of my boyfriend and close friends. i don't really care for the attention of anyone else, and quite frankly, sometimes it does irritate me if someone is trying to get my attention and i don't care for them.\n  ","415760":"\n  i have no complaints at the moment, which is a nice change from the usual. i've had a lot more motivation these days compared to the past few years, and i actually have a semi-positive outlook for the future. there are some things i wish i could change, but right now, they're mostly out of my control so the only thing i can really do is ride it out and take each day as it comes.\n  ","415761":"\n  i prefer rustic or industrial-styled homes -- a lot of wood, piping, brown and mahogany colors, etc etc. i also love big bay windows and natural lighting, as well as skylights, and fireplaces.\n  ","415762":"\n  i don't remember what it was that i was laughing about, but it happened last night. lmao. i just remember laughing to the point where it made my abdomen hurt & tears were welling up in my eyes.\n  ","415763":"\n  it personally makes no difference to me, but considering my boyfriend is a handyman, that's essentially his lifelong dream. he always discusses what sorts of rooms he wants, what he wants in those rooms, blueprints for the house, where he'll put his fish tanks and lizard tanks, etc etc.\n  \n  because of that, i've always envisioned us buying an old home and basically reworking it little by little.\n  ","415764":"\n  check up on social media, i.e. instagram, askfm, and twitter usually. if nothing is going on there, then i'll usually put netflix on and watch something in the meantime. i also play video games when i'm bored too.\n  ","415765":"\n  my page is fairly active, yes. i always wake up to at least 10 questions, and i get a few here & there throughout the day as well. this evening has actually been incredibly active, for some weird reason.\n  ","415766":"\n  i used to a lot in the past, but not so much anymore. i never respond to anon hate, so i assume that whoever used to send it to me just got tired of getting no response out of me, so they stopped.\n  ","415767":"\n  no, i have no reason to disable anonymous questions. if i did, then my inbox would be bone-dry all the time, lol.\n  ","415768":"\n  no, i try not to be rude in general. the only times i'm rude are when someone is rude to me first and their behavior or statements warrants a rude response.\n  ","415769":"\n  indecisive, emotionally unstable, and passionate.\n  ","415770":"\n  i use an NYX highlight & contour palette, which is

me !! hahah.\n  ","415847":"\n  out of basic human decency ?? lol.\n  \n  everyone (with the exception of a few select kinds of individuals) deserves basic respect and decency. obviously if a person is being disrespectful or discriminatory towards another, they should be corrected. but the way you phrased this insinuates that *everyone* who is trans, gay, or female, etc etc., are discriminatory, which obviously isn't the case.\n  ","415848":"\n  i'm against circumcision in general, so i wouldn't have it happen either way.\n  ","415849":"\n  i'm guessing you're also against GMOs, lmao.\n

a real opinion.\n  ","415852":"\n  i'm a scorpio.\n  ","415853":"\n  no, karma is different from cause & effect. karma is the belief that an omniescent presence or source will reward those who are good and punish those who are bad. in reality, that's often not the case at all, which is why i don't believe in karma.\n  ","415854":"\n  absolutely. you can be discriminatory against a person regardless of what or who you are, and just because you're from a discriminated group, it doesn't mean you're given a pass to be discriminatory either.\n  ","415855":"\n  i normally watch tv shows or movies that revolve around crime or prison. i just finished up women behind bars & i'm currently watching the innocent man on netflix.\n  ","415856":"\n  well, yeah. if you do something then it's going to have an effect on someone else (or yourself), whether it's initially apparent or not.\n  ","415857":"\n  technically, it's both. society is naturally discriminatory against people who are female, or trans, or mentally\/physically ill or disabled, or of a sexuality that isn't heterosexual.\n  \n  personally speaking, i've had experiences with individuals also discriminating against me for those things as well.\n  ","415858":"\n  no, i don't believe in karma.\n  ","415859":"\n  no. granted, it isn't as unfair as other countries, but the united states still has a whole realm of injustices when it comes to the way the government treats its citizens.\n  ","415860":"\n  i've been discriminated against due to the fact that i'm assigned female at birth, that i'm non-binary, that i'm mentally ill, and that i'm bisexual.\n  ","415861":"\n  yeah, i've been voting since i turned 18.\n  ","415862":"\n  no, there have been instances where polling places were allegedly rigged to prevent certain people from voting, some people didn't come up as registered to vote even though they should have been, and votes from certain regions were apparently \"lost\" or weren't counted correctly.\n  ","415863":"\n  no, not at all. everyone is comprised of unique experiences that have shaped them into the person they currently are, so really no two people are exactly alike due to the vast range of experiences we all have, as well as our innate personalities and behaviors which are attached to those experiences.\n  ","415864":"\n  you brought up some really good points !! i can't copy\/paste on my phone but i did read all of your messages.\n  \n  i can understand it being complicated if the surrogate develops a connection with the child, because that can often happen even if the person thinks previously that they won't be emotionally involved. pregnancy alters your hormones so pretty much anything can happen in that regard, regardless of the legal documents involved in the case too.\n  ","415865":"\n  i like rainbow cookies & cannolis.\n  ","415866":"\n  my personality type is INFJ.\n  ","415867":"\n  i'm a big fan of serif fonts, so fonts like century, cambria, goudy old style, and perpetua are among my favorites.\n  ","415868":"\n  finding the motivation to get back into the habit of writing. i started writing in my mindfulness journal the other day, which i'm going to start writing again today and tomorrow, but having an empty page in front of me has always been so daunting since i always place such high expectations on myself.\n  ","415869":"\n  at the moment, expensive designer brands. i know a few people who exclusively purchase ridiculously expensive designer items, such as clothing and accessories, and i never saw the appeal in it because you can find something with the same (if not better) quality for a much cheaper price that isn't a designer brand.\n  ","415870":"\n  -- i drink at least 3-4 cups of coffee per day.\n  \n  -- i'm only five feet tall (most people think i'm much taller, lol).\n  \n  -- i never learned how to ride a bicycle as a child.\n  \n  -- my passions include writing, the arts, and mental health advocacy.\n  \n  -- my favorite hobbies include listening to music and playing video games.\n  ","415871":"\n  i'm not entirely sure -- i don't know much about the whole immigration issue, to be quite honest, but i know building a multi-billion dollar wall is definitely not going to help anything.\n  ","415872":"\n  yes, i believe vaccinations should legally be mandatory. they're necessary for the survival of children, and it's extremely irresponsible to not vaccinate your children because even if they don't get sick, they can pass on those symptoms to children who are too young to get the necessary vaccinations. it's dangerous for everyone involved, and anti-vaxx parents are partially the reasons why there have been such an outbreak of what used to be rare diseases in children.\n  ","415873":"\n  i think giving children puberty blockers can be extremely detrimental to their growth and development, from a medical standpoint. i sympathize and understand the feelings of being in the wrong body, but i believe that a child should be at least 16 or 18 years old before they can start transitioning via hormones.\n  ","415874":"\n  i'm most proud of not having a relapse in symptoms in quite a few months & still having the motivation to live my life even when hard times have fallen upon me. it's an amazing change to me, because in the past, any small inconvenience would trigger my depression & anxiety & mood instability, which made it extremely difficult to cope with life stressors.\n  \n  my next goals are to eventually need less medication, and perhaps my doctor and i can wean me off of at least one of my medications that may not be necessary anymore.\n  ","415875":"\n  why wouldn't it be ethical ?? i think it's a wonderful concept for parents who cannot carry a pregnancy to term on their own. it's helpful to a lot of parents who want a child with their own genes despite the fact that a pregnancy for them might be too high-risk for them to carry the child themselves.\n  ","415876":"\n  no, i don't support the death penalty. i think it's an easy way out, and those who commit gruesome or horrific crimes should get life in prison or solitary confinement, not a means by which they can escape their mistakes.\n  ","415877":"\n  thank you !! i made it a few months ago, haha.\n  ","415878":"\n  probably not -- i probably don't have the aptitude or strength to actually make it to space itself, and i really don't have a reason to go there.\n  ","415879":"\n  love is my boyfriend holding my hand while he's driving, lighting my cigarette for me in the wee hours of the morning when the frost is still fresh on the grass, pulling me in closer in the middle of the night while we're sleeping under heavy blankets. love is my boyfriend calling me in the middle of his work day to ask me how i'm doing, maintaining interest in the simple pleasures of my life, and discussing thoughts and ideas that come to mind. love is laughter and staying up late in the night because we lose track of time, taking road trips and listening to music together.\n  ","415880":"\n  low ?? idk what you mean by that.\n  ","415881":"\n  well now that my inbox is empty, i'm hella bored. lol.\n  \n  anyone have any question ??\n  ","415882":"\n  i get scared when i'm going into the garage to take the garbage out because it's so dark in there, lmao. i run to turn on the lights, because i still have that childish fear of someone or something hiding in the garage that will attack me.\n  ","415883":"\n  that sounds like a \"you\" problem, not a \"me\" problem.\n  ","415884":"\n  i've had way too many usernames over the past 15 years, so i guess i have been creative with them, lol.\n  ","415885":"\n  sometimes, i do. they're not so much grudges as much as they are temporary feelings of dislike, though. they don't last very long & i can go from disliking a friend for not texting me back or inviting me somewhere, to later on, talking to them as if nothing happened a few days later out of needing the social interaction.\n  ","415886":"\n  no, my family doesn't have any traditions.\n  ","415887":"\n  it just isn't something my family buys, and i'm not the biggest fan of the taste anyway.\n  ","415888":"\n  i don't normally eat crab.\n  ","415889":"\n  i prefer blueberries, raspberries, peaches, and bananas.\n  \n  there aren't really any fruits i dislike, i just prefer the above ones over others. the fruit i probably dislike the most is blackberries, though. they just taste bitter to me.\n  ","415890":"\n  i would prefer if abvsers, rvpists, & p*dophiles weren't members of society at all.\n  ","415891":"\n  i would always prefer the former as opposed to the latter option. most of the time, bosses can be jerks because of the immense pressure on them to have tasks done in a timely manner and with efficiency, and sometimes their higher-ups have unrealistic expectations. if that boss is a jerk but is also readily available to you at all times and willing to help, then that's a really good compromise.\n  ","415892":"\n  a breakup can be a mutual agreement while still being hurtful to both parties, which is normally the case. i've seen relationships where they broke up due to the understanding that they weren't in the right time frame to pursue their relationship further, and they ended up getting back together after a few years.\n  ","415893":"\n  no, sleep deprivation is not a method of self harm.\n  \n  self harm is clearly defined in the DSM-IV and DSM-V as the intentional, direct injuring of the body without having svicidal intentions. this includes c*tting, burning, scratching or hitting. it used to include skin-picking & hair-pulling, but i don't think these classify as traditional methods of self harm anymore.\n  ","415894":"\n  it depends on my mood, really. sometimes i have the patience to have a civil discussion about controversial topics, while other times i simply don't care to have any sort of conversation about them.\n  ","415895":"\n  yes !! i'm pretty much *always* listening to music, except for when i'm at work (music distracts me when i'm working). however, when it comes to doing household chores or just being lazy at home, i'm normally listening to music all the time.\n  ","415896":"\n  if they're okay with hurting you, then they're probably not the right person, no. i was referring more to relationships where the breakup is a mutual agreement because they're not at the right moment of their lives to successfully pursue that relationship -- this is seen pretty often when people are attending college in different places.\n  \n  i understand waiting for that person, but i also understand breaking up temporarily so that each person can experience their lives and the people in their lives as it happens. just because you break up with someone also doesn't necessarily mean that they're never going to be in your life anymore, either.\n  ","415897":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm doing well -- just drinking coffee, listening to music, & answering questions. i kinda regret sleeping the whole morning away, but i suppose i needed it.\n  ","415898":"\n  if you were running away, then you wouldn't have returned to askfm at all. sounds like you were just fed up with the people you were associated with, so you made a new account to start fresh.\n  ","415899":"\n  i get those same feelings sometimes, yeah. however, you have to remember that nobody's life is *perfect* and people choose to only post about their successes and good times as opposed to their struggles. even so, sometimes it can be difficult to really watch those successes because they seem so much more poignant than our successes (even if objectively that isn't the case), so i totally understand where you're coming from.\n  ","415900":"\n  surprisingly, yes !! the second day of the year, my boss called me over to her desk to help set me up and train me on the administrative duties of one of the programs my company offers to their members.\n  \n  it's something she's been wanting to train me on for a while, but hasn't had the chance to because she's been so busy with everything else. so on wednesday, we sat down and discussed my responsibilities within the program and she gave me a bunch of assignments to complete for the rest of the week. i ended up finishing all of the outstanding orders from 2018 between wednesday and friday.\n  ","415901":"\n  probably because i used the QOTD last night to post \"anyone have any questions ??\" to invite people to ask me things, and then i ended up falling asleep shortly thereafter. lmao.\n  ","415902":"\n  askfm & instagram.\n  \n  i like askfm because i find the questions people ask me to be interesting, and it also gives me the opportunity to educate people about topics such as mental health. i also like reading my friends' answers.\n  \n  instagram, i mainly use for IG stories and posting photos occasionally. it helps me keep in contact with some of my coworkers as well, and it's interesting to have that sneak peek of insight into another person's life when you view their stories.\n  ","415903":"\n  i usually just go straight to the point, personally. however, it's not as if it's random because it's usually related to the initial conversation, lol. i'm very honest and open with my friends & boyfriend during conversations, so i have no issue with asking a question or something.\n  ","415904":"\n  i know a fairly decent amount of information about drugs due to my own personal experiences with them.\n  \n  i think it's better to have an in-depth understanding of drugs as opposed to being ignorant about them, because you simply don't know who in your life may be struggling with addiction and requires help. if you understand drugs and how they work, it'll be easier to help that person rather than if you had no idea about drugs whatsoever.\n  ","415905":"\n  i'm doing well -- i woke up not too long ago (yes, even though it's noon ...), so now i'm just having my first cup of coffee for the day and checking up on social media. i found a lot of questions in my inbox, so i decided to hop on my laptop to answer them faster instead of wasting my phone's battery.\n  ","415906":"\n  yes, i believe so. this coincides partially with my last answer regarding relationships, but if you and your partner don't have the same ideas in regards to the future to the point where you feel you must break up in order to progress further in your life, then it's completely possible for you to still love that person and vice versa while ending the relationship.\n  \n  in addition, i always found it interesting that some people can be the \"right\" person for each other, but they're simply at the wrong point in their lives to pursue that relationship.\n  ","415907":"\n  LOL, YES. the electricity for the entire block went down a few months ago, so we really couldn't do anything for a few hours until the power came back on.\n  \n

but i didn't want to waste my battery so i didn't use it at all.\n  ","415908":"\n  yeah, i always check the date when i shop for food.\n  ","415909":"\n  if you and your partner don't have the same ideas in mind in terms of your future, then there isn't really much you *can* do, unfortunately. your relationship may be great in the present moment, but that doesn't mean things won't see friction in the future when it comes to ideas such as marriage or having a family.\n  \n  at that point, it might be best for you two to break up in order to find someone else who better fits those interests.\n  ","415910":"\n  i've never been a fan of the color yellow -- especially like a mustard yellow. i know some people who really do love the color, though, and look great when they wear

of some items if they still look\/smell\/taste fine. i won't f*ck with dairy products, though.\n  \n  beauty products, not so much. i've been using the same concealer for two years, and it's been perfectly fine for me, lol.\n  ","415912":"\n  i've never concerned myself with becoming popular on askfm, so i really have no clue.\n  \n  i suppose just remaining active on the site -- asking questions, answering questions, liking other people's answers, making polls, etc etc.\n  ","415913":"\n  for the most part, yes. especially when it comes to buying things off of amazon. there are so many similar products that it's difficult to really determine which one is the best one, so the review section is extremely helpful in that regard.\n  ","415914":"\n  my boyfriend has facial hair, so yes. however, even when he does shave (which has only happened maybe once or twice, lol), he's still attractive to me.\n  ","415915":"\n  i only obviously wear them during the summer, but they're

so. there's a separation between gender and rebelling against societal expectations. personally speaking, i wanted to be a boy for much of my earlier life, even my parents have told me stories of me wanting to be a boy and dressing as a boy and not doing certain things because boys didn't do those things.\n  \n  it's different. and i understand that because you're not non-binary or trans, that you may not understand it completely. however, that doesn't mean that you can't respect people still even if you disagree with them.\n  ","415959":"\n  considering i've never been a woman, this doesn't apply to me. i haven't been comfortable identifying as a woman or a girl my entire life, even before i was aware of the traditional societal expectations that are placed upon women. it's only been within the past three years that i discovered what non-binary meant, and before that, i just used the term genderfluid.\n  ","415960":"\n  thank you, i'm quite aware of the whole societal norms concept.\n  ","415961":"\n  i'm happy that they discovered who they truly are, as it takes a lot of self realization to really figure out things that are so integral to your sense of self.\n  \n  that

in your relationship -- sit her down and tell her how you honestly feel, how it's affecting you, and how you feel like things used to be fun but aren't much anymore. perhaps you two can come to a compromise regarding how to liven up your relationship again.\n  \n  if that doesn't work, then break up. relationships are supposed to be fun, even if you've been with someone a long time, and you should never lose that sense of fun.\n  ","415964":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","415965":"\n  draco malfoy is my favorite character. i've always loved the series because it was the

chips.\n  ","415970":"\n  p*dophilia isn't a sexuality, and their desire to infiltrate the lgbtq community is absolutely disgusting.\n  \n  that's all i'm saying further on this topic. the only reason

guys are really grasping at straws now.\n  ","416090":"\n  attraction = a desire to perform sxxual acts upon a person.\n  \n  i'm pretty done with this whole conversation, though. the amount of people

right, i'mma just leave this here. my case has been closed.\n  ","416092":"\n  i already posted my opinion on that stance a few answers ago. in short, non-offending p*dophiles are at high risk of acting on their thoughts and the rate in which p*dophilia is \"cured\" is significantly low.\n  \n  for the safety of everyone involved, prison is the only answer in my eyes.\n  ","416093":"\n  that's exactly what i was thinking. people with mood disorders or personality disorders (among others) are often the victims of sxxual abvse themselves. to compare depression\/anxiety\/BPD\/psychosis\/whatever with p*dophilia is unfounded.\n  ","416094":"\n  you're sounding like a p*do apologist, and if this continues, then i'm discontinuing this discussion.\n  \n  in simple terms, you can't compare p*dophilia with other disorders because it's literally a criminal offense.\n  ","416095":"\n  it makes no difference to me. if you're attracted to children, then you can rot in prison regardless of whether or not you've acted on your thoughts or why you developed that attraction to begin with. it's inherently wrong, immoral, and disgusting.\n  ","416096":"\n  according to scientific reports, p*dophilia is attraction to prepubescent children, so i'm assuming there isn't a concrete age.\n  ","416097":"\n  the fact that they're a p*dophile automatically means that their very existence is wrong.\n  ","416098":"\n  ... you can't compare stealing something to someone being attracted to children.\n  ","416099":"\n  p*dophiles rarely seek professional treatment for their attraction because they either don't believe that what they're thinking is wrong, or if they do know it's wrong, they're less likely to report their thoughts to a professional in fear of imprisonment, considering it's a criminal offense.\n  \n  that being said, the rate in which p*dophiles actually \"recover\" from their attraction is significantly low. they're better off just being thrown in jail, in my opinion, so that they're not given any opportunity to act on their desires.\n  ","416100":"\n  i'm watching the innocent man on netflix, & it's really good so far. i had to start

degree, yeah. i don't really remember much of that sort of thing, though.\n  ","416102":"\n  uh, i never said anything about therapy or medication.\n  ","416103":"\n  lmao, yes they do. even when you're upset or angry, you still have an idea of what's acceptable versus unacceptable behavior.\n  ","416104":"\n  no. being mentally ill doesn't excuse you from acting out on problematic or toxic behavior. you don't get a pass just because you're mentally ill. you still know right from wrong.\n  ","416105":"\n  yes -- i believe that p*dophiles are inherently bad people even if they never acted out on their fantasies.\n  ","416106":"\n  i've done some pretty terrible things, but i'm not an inherently bad person.\n  ","416107":"\n  i've known i've been mentally ill since i was 11 years old. i didn't start seeking formal treatment until i was 24 years old.\n  \n  so no -- my conclusions weren't based on what people told me, those diagnoses were established after i discussed my ongoing symptoms with a professional for several appointments.\n  ","416108":"\n  it's impossible to conclude that *all* people in a group are one way or another -- life isn't black & white like that. while there are some people who are genuinely terrible people who probably do struggle with unresolved mental health issues, that doesn't infer that everyone who is a bad person must have a mental illness.\n  ","416109":"\n  where have i ever suggested that mental illness doesn't exist. lmfao.\n  \n  did you forget that i'm in ongoing treatment for my own mental illnesses ??\n  ","416110":"\n  like i said earlier, it's wrong to armchair diagnosis a person without conducting a formal psychiatric evaluation on them. there have been concerns about trump's mental health in the past, but considering no one who made those claims ever met trump or are likely not even mental health practitioners, then their claims are unfounded.\n  \n  it's easy to point at a \"\"bad\"\" person and attribute their behavior to mental illness, but that only adds to the stigma surrounding mental health. there are simply people out there who are genuinely bad people and that has nothing to do with mental illness.\n  ","416111":"\n  i don't think it's really correct to assume that someone automatically has a mental illness solely because they believe in god. it's also wrong to armchair diagnosis people without actually knowing them or performing a formal psychiatric evaluation individually.\n  ","416112":"\n  there are some things that are really ableist, while there are other things that are slightly ableist. your questions about schizophrenia lead me to believe that you have a slightly ableist mindset when it comes to mental illness.\n  ","416113":"\n  \"for your information.\"\n  ","416114":"\n  you're probably better off asking someone who's actually schizophrenic.\n  \n  btw these questions are leaning toward the ableist end of the spectrum, fyi.\n  ","416115":"\n  schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by changes in genetic composition and chemical imbalances that lend themselves to some of the primary symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, etc etc.\n  \n  people who think they can talk to god or have seen \"\"visions\"\" from god aren't normally mentally ill or have those specific chemical compositions. that's why disorders like schizophrenia are medical conditions, while believing in god is just religious belief.\n  ","416116":"\n  moving away to attend college for the first time was a bittersweet feeling,
