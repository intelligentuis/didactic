off the ground and put it in the middle of the street . the dude kindly said to me save my seat and then went and got my backpack for me . i tried to save it , but the girl dove for it and i was literally wrestling with a stranger , so i shortly just gave up . i regret not giving up the seat to make things simpler , and if not , i should have at least got up once she took the dudes seat
