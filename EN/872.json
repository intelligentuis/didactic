Make a goal for each day that\u2019s something you can actually achieve. Don\u2019t forget that people care about you too. Reach out to your family and friends let them know you\u2019re going through a hard time right now and let them know if there\u2019s anything they can do to help you, even if that just means listening or reminding you to do your laundry or clean your room or do your homework.

You may have seen us on YouTube and wondered, who are these girls? We are 6 sisters from a family of 11 kids- yep, we also have 5 brothers! We started our band in our hometown in Northern California in 2007 and since then it's been quite the journey. From playing classic rock covers as a full band, to creating acapella arrangements of covers and uploading them to our YouTube channel, to moving to L.A. and signing with a major record label, to going the traditional \"girl group\" route, to completely rebelling from that and dressing super grungey and performing a 90 minute set of almost all acoustic songs, to leaving our record label and moving all the way to Nashville to become independent artists, we've come a long way since 2007! lol\n  \n  The ONE constant in our journey has always been YOU GUYS- our amazing, bizarre, international, devoted internet family, the Cim Fam!! We really could not have done any of this without you guys, and to say we are incredibly thankful and full of gratitude for each and every one of you is a HUGE understatement.. THANK YOU, from the bottom of our hearts! We love you guys so much, and every single decision we make is with you and your well-being in mind!\n  \n  Through this crazy and incredible journey, what we've learned is that the most important part of what we do is the MESSAGE. You guys poured out your hearts to us and shared your darkest secrets, and we realized the only thing we could do was pour our hearts out back to you and make music with the messages we believe will be helpful and positive to you. Our messages are anti-suicide, positive body image, strong self-worth, and finding Faith in the darkest of times. Our mission is to create music and art that reflects this strong core belief that NO ONE is a lost cause- there is hope for everyone, no matter how \"far gone\" they may seem.\n  \n  We have cried in front of you guys dozens of times on stages from the U.S. to South America to Europe to the Philippines. We have held you, hugged you and listened to your stories in person in meet and greet lines and backstage. We know your hearts, and we care deeply for you guys as if you were our own brothers and sisters, and that is what makes us family!\n  ","936431":"\n  Really good\n  ","936432":"\n  Sleep\n  ","936433":"\n  Nope\n  ","936434":"\n  Who is asking?\n  ","936435":"\n  Because everyone tries to compete with each other on who or what looks better and like a picture perfect family.
