   Were you raised to believe one thing (from church or parents), but decided for yourself not to believe it? Like if you were raised to believe that being gay was a sin but decided on your own that you don't believe it's a sin. Any examples like that in your life? 🤔

  Yes... I was raised in a baptist Christian house, but with reading the Bible various ways one thing has stuck out the most with today’s stuff going on... there is only one important verse out of them all and that’s the road to salvation regardless of what or who you are.

  They did a big level squish back to 60 but all the other expacs after the new starting area go from 10-50 then shadowlands is 50-60
  
  And yes it’s still 15$ but also depending on how much gold this WoWtoken is (it hangs around 117k gold) you can purchase one of those on Auction house to use for game time... if you are good at selling stuff that could pay for the game.

   What is the most dangerous thing you have ever done?
  ","
  Well it might not be huge... but switching out newly pierced ear studs with slightly bigger (16g) horseshoe earrings.. there’s always the risk of the hole closing or missing the exit (which did happen) and had to use a sharp pointed tweezer end to get another hole for the exit to get the earring through. That was the cartilage..:: the lobe piercings are worse to do that too.

   What is one thing that happened in your life that without it happening, you would never be where you are today?
  ","
  As much as I hate to say it, I probably wouldn't be better if both falling into corruption happened leading to the death at the maelstrom then waking up aboard a craft of some sort which is now like home.

   Greetings, Earth Warder! 
I have a simple query to impose. Elaborate if you must! 
What are your feelings towards your sister, Alexstrasza, and the great shaman, Go'el? These were two of your most desperate foes during the Shattering. But what of now?
  ","
  Well I'm sure it will be plenty if time before any of my dragon kin ever really accept me as family again, and understand this. As for thrall.. Go'el.. We have been working together on Dreanor with the elemental shamans of Nagrand, the elementals themselves to help other warriors get that power over Gul'Dans forces.

   Why release them now?  Were you holding onto them for a specIfication reason? Love it btw :)

  Honestly bc I didn't think they were that good! They're a lot more simple lyrically and musically than what I write now. But I thought that they might be really relatable to people who are going through what I was going through and I also thought it would be really cool to have like a time capsule of that time of my life. And after finishing them up I actually like all of them.

  Cause you don't see me have someone special
  
  I don't know your intentions, what you're thinking

  I don't why it matters, so much that I'm shattered
  
  What's going on with me
  
  It's such a sad thing, wanting to be wanted
  
  I know it's not that deep
  
  It's barely been two weeks

  And I just wanna forget this
  
  But I've got nothing еlse to do
  
  don't know why I'm lying in my bed
  
  And trying to think of a perfect scheme
  
  To get your attention, to get you to listen
  
  To get you to somehow miss me
  
  There's nothing I can do
  
  You don't get to choose who loves you

  All the things I do over again
  
  All those nights and all the time spent
  
  I'm creating fixes for broken promises
  
  Trying to be protective
  
  But I end up doing nothing

  I never try too hard 'cause I'm always joking

  not posting the actual pictures of us together showing our faces bc I know you will get tons of backlash and attention that you dont need but )
  
  26. Today you're turning 26, 6 years ago I met you the first time and didn't realize the impact you would leave on my life or how close we would eventually come. I was young, very young and touring europe for probably the first time of my life but also dealing with a heartbreak that I thought would never heal completely. But something during those first few months started to change that. Even though it was eventually rye who I met. You grasped my attention at the right moment and we got to know eachother and become closer. You just knew right away how to make me smile, make me laugh and just over all knew me and actually understood without judgement.   Over time you became my best friend who I shared everything with, and i didn't realize i was falling in love with you as well during those moments. Our relationship wasn't always perfect, and we had our moments of arguments and avoidance from time to time but after everything had calmed down. We found our ways back into each others life. And we both knew that no matter how hard we tried, we could never fully escape from eachothers lives and we would somehow always be connected. Maybe it was just the world telling us that we were special who really knows? But one thing I am for certain is I love you 💜 so happy birthday Ands!! Thank you for the countless endless memories and for always making me happy, thank you for staying up till four am just talking about life and always following along with my wild ideas I would get. Yes you're getting old but that's fine because i wouldn't want to ever replace you for someone younger who is stupid 💜

  "
888856,"
   How parents go from “S3x is bad” to “I want grandkids”?
  ","
  As their kids grow older and move out and do things in life without always needing their guidance and reassurance, parents start to miss the little pitter patter sounds of small feet on the floor, they miss hearing a child's laughter, they miss kissing the cheeks and giving comfort when someone was hurt, they miss having small conversations but overall the miss when a house used to be so alive and filled with the small blessings of life. ... that's why they want grandchildren
  "

  Last night my anxiety hit me pretty bad where I couldn't sleep. Normally I'm not awake after like 2 am at the latest unless it's a time zone change ( in this case it wasnt). Even though I'm on medication for it. My anxiety has been flaring up pretty bad right before I fall asleep for a week now. What i did was just stay up and talked to one of my friends (major props to them for being supportive) and eventually fell asleep after their reassurance several times

  So happy reading all your reactions to “8am” coming out yesterday 💜💜 it’s crazy how something so specific that I went through can still be relatable to so many other people. I guess getting ghosted is just a universal experience and we all feel kinda the same way after. Am I not good enough? Is there anything I can do to get them back? Why does it hurt so much? When will this pain finally go away? Listen to my new song 8am if you relate to any of those feelings. maybe it will help you release some of that and feel a little better 💜

  I'm going to kinda talk about two of my sisters. Lisa my older sister, used to smoke cigarettes as a teenager she gave that up eventually. She chosen not to drink or smoke anymore after seeing so many families be broken because of alcohol and smoking being involved or having negative effects. Seeing abuse and so on. My baby sister dani, (she spoke about this so it's fine for me to say). Got lost on a path in her teenage years where she felt like she didnt really fit in with people or had to impress them so she became this party girl and drinker and smoked weed just to ""fit in"" and feel edgy... she gave that up when she met her now husband

   Sometimes I feel like my pills 💊 for depression doesn’t let me cry and feel the tears, long time with no tears 😅
  ","
  A lot of medication can cause what doctor's call ""dry eyes"" which means your eyes basically are dry and cant produce like tears or anything. You can use eye drops to help with that issue, but if you haven't been like upset or sad then I wouldnt be concerned about not being able to cry. Because that means the antidepressants are actually doing their job. I take a medication before bed to help calm my mind and help with my sleep as u suffer from anxiety attacks but they're worst in my sleep.
  "
889487,"
   Is it okay not to say anything when a person comes to you with a problem and you trying to understand them and help them but they can’t even tell you the problem? Would you worry about helping them or nah?

  Yeah that sucks. Sometimes your childhood friends decide to take a different path in life for a while and you don't really relate to eachother, so a few years can go by before you guys start talking or cross paths again. Sometimes they start coming back around but it they don't then just let them go on in life without you and find new friends who appreciate and support eachother 🧡

  I used to go down to the beach to think and stuff because the sound of the waves and being around the presence of water helped calm me.

Call friends or my sisters if I need to talk to someone or go and see the therapist 🧡

  I think its fits your appearance perfectly, stop letting people bring you down and tell you things that make you feel insecure or no good about yourself.

But hopefully one day) thank you for being one of the first boys out of RT to actually get to know me and being genuine towards me.

   When a person says I don’t like it, they usually mean they do, they don’t like to admit they like it because of social pressure, but on the other hand we’re in the United States, we can even become dancers if we so desire, so what’s the damn problem?

  Actually not everyone has the same opinion or interests etc. That you do, some people may like pop music while others like hip hop.

   How do clothes affect your confidence or personality?
  ","
  With clothes I feel they help shape you into the person you want to be or already are plus they can be styled and altered with whatever you like or dislike. Meaning if you dont like wearing a denim skirt with a white top you can change your top to like a red with denim. Or add/ take away accessories as well. Clothes help bring creativity alive as well and can boost your confidence by making styles look good on you.

  NEW SONG “8am” OUT FRIDAY 1/29
  
  This is the first song I ever fully wrote and recorded. I wrote it when I was 16 about the first time I got ghosted by a boy I spent the whole summer talking to. I had just turned 15 when we stopped talking and it took me almost 2 years to finally move on from it. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know how to find someone else. I didn’t know how to meet new people, I didn’t even know where any new people to meet even were. I cried I think everyday day for 6 months. From September through February. And then I would cry once a week, and then once a month, and then eventually not at all. From the outside it probably looked like nothing, because we were just “friends” and we didn’t even really hang out that much. But we talked everyday and I really felt special for the first time. It meant everything to me. They say the first cut is the deepest and let me tell you that was true for me oof
  
  So here’s another breakup ballad to add to your playlist on 1/29 💔

   What is a relationship deal breaker for you?
  ","
  Lately it has become a huge importance in any friendship/ relationship. But I find one of the main important aspects in a relationship or friendship would be communication or compromise. Your significant other or friends should be able to know and understand what your going through or how you may feel/ be affected etc. Without communication and understanding theres a lot of misunderstandings and conflict which can break trust/ cause a breakup to happen.
  
  Sit down and talk to those people and tell them how you are feeling, make sure they understand or reassure you both got it and will work together to fix whatever issue it may be. Also if there's zero communication then it's mainly one person who is working hard to maintain those friendships and relationships which results in a lot of emotional days and hard feelings, which can just become a very toxic and negative place you're in so it's best to just let go of that person and move on.
  "
889797,"
   Do you believe in God? Why or why not?
  ","
  I have believed in god since I was little bc my parents grew up in the catholic church teachings and beliefs and growing up I kinda followed that path as well. However there are some things I dont agree with or follow tradition on amd that's fine bc you should be able to set your own beliefs and traditions and find what works best for you. But you should also respect others who see or do things differently. I believe there is some higher power in the world and certain things work because of their love.

   is that worth trying to migrate to US!
  ","
  A lot of people from different countries want to move to the usa bc the usa has free education and better medical help than what their country may offer. And better job offers. However I do suggest if you want to move to the usa make sure its legal and safe. Many people try to cross the border and end up getting caught or die/ injure themselves. If they do succeed, immigration laws and ice would eventually find them and force them to return back to wherever they come from. Get a passport/ green card or Visa whatever the term is called where you can stay in the usa and be a citizen after a few years
  "

   THOUGHTS POST:
  ","
  Some random pictures from the last month or so.... This is what life has been looking like. I haven’t really been posting much lately cause I’ve just been thinking a lot. I love the time around New Years because even though literally nothing is different, we’re all still the same people with all the same problems, it feels good to have a whole year ahead of myself and to think about what it could be. I know this year was not what anyone expected and everyone’s plans went into the trash so it might be hard to make any plans or think about how this year could be, but regardless of how crazy things get around us, there are still things that we can control. Our behaviors, mindsets, how we treat ourselves and those around us, our habits... It’s easy to feel like there’s no point in changing or growing when your future feels so uncertain, but actually the future is always uncertain. We’re just more aware of that fact right now. I’ve been thinking about how I view people and the world and how I can change that to a more positive view while still being realistic lol, dealing with some anxiety-inducing mindsets that I’ve gotten so used to experiencing but am realizing they’re actually something I can change, thinking about how I want relationships with family and friends to be better and what type of conversations I need to have or effort I need to put in to do that, thinking about what effect I have had on the world and what effect God wants me to have on the world and how I can better serve Him in the work that I do, thinking about the lifestyle I live and how I want to have a healthier more organized one while still having time to relax and have balance in my life. I encourage you to think about these things for yourself and how you can grow this year regardless of how things go. If we want to make a better world, that starts with each individual person doing and being their best. ❤️

  Dani answered some questions over on her and emmyns channel about what ot was like growing up ""famous"" and much more if anyone is interested in knowing a bit of the background more. Please note that dani LEFT on her own choices a year ago after 10 years of being in the band, no one forced her out or anything. She just simply did not want to be in a band or a singer and had other interests in life she wanted to do. The door IS and WILL always be open to her if she ever decides she wants to come back.

So it's sort of annoying when you try to say oh shes not with that person etc. Look how many months it took everyone to realize i was back with christian after three years apart? So don't even start with oh shes not with so and so... you don't know them to even confirm that. But since y'all like to be in my buisness no I'm not with mikey anymore, but I am talking to someone amd seeing them. No I will not release a name because once again it's no ones concern but mine.

  And you're going around making up false allegations, playing the victim card when you've my dear friend have done way worse then I could have possibly done. It's sad you go around trying to make yourself look innocent and sweet when you're the one who should be penalized and know they're guilty. It's sad you only want attention and do these things just for a quick 2 second of fame and so on. It's sad that I use this app just to have fun and associate with certain people and it has become one of the worse things I've decided to do thanks to you. Do you not realize people dont always have to explain themselves to you? Or do you not realize that people deal with things u have no idea of? You invaded peoples privacy, put peoples safety in jeopardy and so on. And in a way I guess that's the price I pay for growing up in the spotlight since I was 8 years old. I've had rumors thrown at me. I'm used to it, I've been compared to others, ranked the least favorite. Been hated on... this is nothing new to me. Nothing is even original coming from u anyhow. I've been rumored to have dated people I never once spoke a word to and so on so I'm not letting you get the best of me. And i dont owe you anything either not even an explanation

  I don't really know what the point of writing this is going to be or why I'm even writing this to begin with... but for those who got the messages about me leaving temporary because of a situation feel free to read this if you want to. But the current situation:
  
  This situation has been going on for months now that I'm sure it has been going on for a year now already. Usually I'm pretty good at shrugging things off and moving onto more important things and focusing on those. But like any human there are days when things just get to you after so much and start to bother you. First it was the constant anonymous hate from various accounts that were ran by someone named allycia. This person has tried to lie, manipulate, and steal the identity of many other influencers and their friends and family. I have called that person out various times because well she used to fake me. Dani and my family and friends and so on and may still do it on other social media. She would make up false information and treat fans horribly going as far as cussing and so on when none of us would ever treat our fans that way. She also has attempted to put many relationships with family and so on in a toxic place and made those people believe her.
  
  But moving onto the more recent drama in life. .. those who continue to make new accounts under various names every day just to harass me, send hate, threats etc.
  
  What's the reason as to doing this? What's the reason you waste your life trying to tear others down and try to make yourself look like the better person? What's the point in editing messages and screenshotting, using photoshopped amd so on to make things seem realistic and for you to use as so called ""proof"". For starters I shouldn't have to always explain myself to others. I know who I am and what I do. Have i caused any actual harm to anyone? Not that I noticed but if I did I apologize. But if you actually have some sort of truth into the things you fake.... have you ever told what you said? Have you have told them why I may have said those so called horrible things to you? Did you ever tell those people how you would create a new account and talk badly about Amy's appearance and that? Knowing that someone who has a rare disease cant control certain things especially the way their body is shaped, or their height? Or did you ever show the side where you called her a name and talked sexually about her as well? How about the part where you threatened us, or ""Cimorelli members"" if you'll like me to phrase it that way for you. How you threatened to come to our house and k.ill us and so on? Also the fact that you tried to play around and joke about a serious topic such as s.uicide and being a victim of sexual abuse. Did you mention how I reached out to you and tried to help only for you to turn around and send explicit photos of males to me ? Then got mad bc i blocked you and tried to cry wolf and make up a false story to gain attention? People dont know the full story

  I didn't do the memory recap that my siblings and friends were doing lastnight. But one of the most memorable times during 2020 was being able to be with my sisters and working together to provide content for our fans. Also becoming a first time aunt to Barrett James was pretty special ( and an aunt to a little angel in heaven known as Spero).

   Michael do you have the girls patreon?
