Well I like to rap when it's in a song.\n  ","340018":"\n  You may not like this...but it's something you need to know!\n  ","340019":"\n  Wildly lol\n  ","340020":"\n  Amazon\n  ","340021":"\n  Amen!\n  ","340022":"\n  Yes. 8pm to 5am in my county. I still have to work tho. But not open to the public\n  ","340023":"\n  I don't drink much.\n  ","340024":"\n  Too old for clubbing. I'll attend a bday party or 2.\n  ","340025":"\n  Scented candle.\n  ","340026":"\n  I am. Hope floats!\n  ","340027":"\n  No. I admire stuff in people or what the possess. But no. At the end of the day my journey is my journey. If it's material stuff I want...there's no telling what folks went thru to have it. If it's a relationship...only they know what's really going on.\n  ","340028":"\n  Working. My 2 coworkers are out for a few weeks.\n  ","340029":"\n  Average on the best team!\n  ","340030":"\n  I dance and dance to it. But I couldn't tell u any fav DJs anymore besides Daft Punk, Deadmau5, Diplo of course. But I dont know many others by name.\n  ","340031":"\n  I'd like to learn Japanese or Arabic. Interesting cadences. Hmmm...Russia for architecture. Armenia for the food.\n  ","340032":"\n  Ha ha ha! Every 80s movie I love. Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, athena Breakfast Club. I'm a sucker for teen angst movies of the past.\n  ","340033":"\n  Multitasking. Making sure rules are followed. Being of Service.\n  ","340034":"\n  Meeting my incredible friends. As my family shrinks, my best friends have become more & more like family. A shoulder to cry on, a dinner partner, healer, gift giver, tough love bringer, listening ear, etc. For them I am eternally grateful.\n  ","340035":"\n  I think if two people don't want commitment & aren't the jealous type... it could work for them. A lot of people want to \"play the field\" or \"sow their royal oats\". They should set boundaries for their arrangement & practice safe sex.\n  ","340036":"\n  Yes I do. Forgiveness is for me. For my fwd motion in life. With God's help I have forgiven, but for wisdom's sake I have not forgotten.\n  ","340037":"\n  I am happy with who I am. Who I've become. The work it took to truly love myself & others wholeheartedly. As for my life...I'm content with it's forward movement. Expectant of greater.\n  ","340038":"\n  I don't have a suitor. Hopefully one day! Alas, no interested parties at the moment.\n  ","340039":"\n  Elaborate\n  ","340040":"\n  Ha! No. It's a snapchat filter. It's like me with airbrushed makeup & better angles.\n  ","340041":"\n  Good for you!\n  ","340042":"\n  Hi David. Thanks so much! U be careful in these germy environments.\n  ","340043":"\n  Yes I do. Even if it's not a tuition finances factor. If parents have a strong relationship with their children there should be conversations about distance, right fit of school, neighborhood, etc...\n  ","340044":"\n  In maybe 8th or 9th grade I met one of my best friends at a local pool in a neighboring town. She had a bald head (from alopecia) & very oversized bosoms. I was cowering to get into the pool. Self-conscious about my body. She was boisterous & inviting. She made me laugh a lot. I felt safe & comfortable. The rest is history.\n  ","340045":"\n  Go reusable steel straws. Paper straws don't last for me. I don't normally drink until after I eat. By that time the paper straws....(although pretty), are soggy.\n  ","340046":"\n  I'm not into altered states. So I don't dabble in drugs\n  ","340047":"\n  I believe simple to the point of less everything. But feelings are meant to be felt. So long live relationships with feelings.\n  ","340048":"\n  I hate to admit it. I was a strong Team Jacob\n  ","340049":"\n  No I haven't. I'm not on any dating apps.\n  ","340050":"\n  555-5555\n  ","340051":"\n  I didn't. It was one of the 1st page choices ha ha\n  ","340052":"\n  I picked the actions of the meme without thinking of the origin. Lolol\n  ","340053":"\n  Hmmm...I was once in a strait to DVD movie. I won't reveal the title. No. It was not porn nor a political docu.\n  ","340054":"\n  The capt'n?\n  ","340055":"\n  Ha!!!!!\n  ","340056":"\n  I haven't played video games in so long. Although my cousins play in the basement regularly.  Call of Duty is their thing right now\n  ","340057":"\n  You had me at gnocci!!!!!!!\n  ","340058":"\n  Nope. Get your grub on!\n  ","340059":"\n  Not well. And my current pet was just diagnosed a few weeks ago with severe heart disease. *sigh\n  ","340060":"\n  Certain voice tones.\n  ","340061":"\n  A say? Hmmm...I don't think they have the right to pick & choose who their ex dates. But I do believe they can voice their opinions when it comes to safety, exposure to stuff & child rearing in general.\n  ","340062":"\n  Do tell. What did you make?\n  ","340063":"\n  Roger that\n  ","340064":"\n  I eat roe \/ caviar.\n  ","340065":"\n  At least it's fresh fresh. Ha!\n  ","340066":"\n  Today I used Himalayan sea salt. I add it to boiling pasta water as well as when sweating out onions and peppers on the stove.\n  ","340067":"\n  My mom knows how much my friends love her. She inputs herself loosely. It's hilarious when they oblige her.\n  ","340068":"\n  It has a flow. Feast or famine. How about you?\n  ","340069":"\n  I was going to church but its cancelled due to COVID-19\n  ","340070":"\n  Coooooool!\n  ","340071":"\n  Let's go!!!!\n  ","340072":"\n  That sounds pretty cool!!!!!\n  ","340073":"\n  My mom is currently eating Chicharrones (fried pork cracklings) from the local Dominican Grocery! I'm not.\n  \n  Although I really used to loved it. I'm\n  \n  pescatarian now. I just ate Bacalao Guisado con Papa. (Codfish & potatoes in red stew like sauce).\n  ","340074":"\n  Hmmm...perhaps my less then self-loving actions. I don't always get these stops on the journey of life right on the 1st try.\n  ","340075":"\n  Friendship involves caring about the overall well-being of another. It reflects not only loyalty, but kindred-like moments. My best friends\/bros are my chosen family. They have come to my rescue more than once & have acted as a mirror when I needed to truly see myself &\/or my actions.\n  ","340076":"\n  Imagine that you are victorious!\n  ","340077":"\n  Sure did. Only on the top row. For some reason people couldn't see them when I spoke. But trust me I felt them.\n  ","340078":"\n  I think strength comes from unity and knowledge can be gained from people from all walks of life. I am not a fan of exclusionary actions. I understand the uber rich & powerful must take security measures to sustain a lifestyle, but at the end of the day a safe life is maintained thru limited close access, being around people of character who exhibit loyalty while still showing love. That exists in every race, culture, etc.\n  ","340079":"\n  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n  ","340080":"\n  Goodnight. And to you!\n  ","340081":"\n  Being smart & safe, but remaining loving from a distance. Thank you. Will do!\n  ","340082":"\n  Thx for asking. I hope U R well. I've been stressed this week btwn transitioning to a new job & nat'l news. Monday I started (1\/2 days at both jobs, 2 diff buildings, 2 diff roles, but - same employer). That & COVID-19 is in my town & two neighboring towns in Northern New Jersey. The community is in a frenzy! And I feel their anxiety.\n  ","340083":"\n  Yum!\n  ","340084":"\n  Saturday idk reading, planning, relaxing, cooking. My church service is cancelled this Sunday. I still have to work next week. Both coworkers out for 2 wks. 1 becoz of age. 1 becoz of small child home due to schools closed. Ugh!\n  ","340085":"\n  Pray\n  ","340086":"\n  As a thrill sport competition yes I think so.\n  ","340087":"\n  Yes. I attempted to visit the empire state building years back but there was a fog warning.\n  ","340088":"\n  Judge each man separately on their own merit & character.\n  ","340089":"\n  Yes there is a case in my town, a few in the next town & 2 in the next. Go North Jersey! Stores are...ugh. Schools are closed for the next 2 weeks in my county.\n  ","340090":"\n  Ha! A hug. But the way this COVID-19 is going.

She was flirting with people too. Very awkward stupid times.\n  ","340105":"\n  I do but not always by choice. My mom sometimes ODs and I begin to feel like everything is deadly while cooking. Lol\n  ","340106":"\n  I'm glad someone agrees\n  ","340107":"\n  Ha ha ha you too?!!\n  ","340108":"\n  God\n  ","340109":"\n  Speaking in front of large crowds. It's one-on-one that freaks me out.\n  ","340110":"\n  That's very indigenous people minded of you. A beautiful sentiment.\n  ","340111":"\n  Black licorice is gross\n  ","340112":"\n  Really? Did you eat it afterwards?\n  ","340113":"\n  Small gatherings\n  ","340114":"\n  No. Wow have you?\n  ","340115":"\n  I think honesty is key. If the understanding is monogamy then cheating is betrayal. I rather someone tell me they don't want a relationship than be the only dedicated person. Cheating starts in the mind. So I don't dig emotional cheating either. It's a persons choice to forgive & accept a cheater back into their sanctum.\n  ","340116":"\n  Brussel Sprouts\n  ","340117":"\n  Lying\n  ","340118":"\n  Lol\n  ","340119":"\n  No not in this regard\n  ","340120":"\n  No becoz I'm old enough to be an 18 year old's mom\n  ","340121":"\n  Enjoy your day\n  ","340122":"\n  Do I? I'm not a mother.\n  ","340123":"\n  Chapstick!!!!\n  ","340124":"\n  Absolutely & we have home rules\n  ","340125":"\n  It depends on the type of people there. Strangers I'm ok. People I know...more nervousness.\n  ","340126":"\n  Woof Woof\n  ","340127":"\n  Truth\n  ","340128":"\n  I enjoy helping people. And thank God I haven't been abused. Certainly manipulation could happen so I exercise great discernment.\n  ","340129":"\n  I would love to garden. One day I'll have a home where I can really experiment. I want to plant my own herbs & I adore flowers.\n  ","340130":"\n  Fish yes! I'm pescatarian\n  ","340131":"\n  I don't mind the questions. I just wish that people would refrain from asking me sexual preference questions.\n  ","340132":"\n  Call me wags a lot. Lol!\n  ","340133":"\n  Not sure. There's mass hysteria in my area as we are close to NYC and confirmed cases are coming in.

Or is it just me? I sweaty but happy!\n  ","340137":"\n  My most cheerful memory as a grownup was my birthday party last year. It was a Harlem Renaissance\/ Roaring 20s dress up theme. Amazing having people from all walks of life in the same place. Different races, religions & ages.\n  ","340138":"\n  Had 3 special people pass this past year. Songs, holidays & food remind me of them. Their vitality & the love they gave.\n  ","340139":"\n  My biggest regret of the past 5 years is sitting on my resources and talents. Waiting for the perfect time. There is no perfect time. Just the courage & discipline to act.\n  ","340140":"\n  \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude35\ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd2f\n  "}}
