certainly something different from what i m used to seeing in my inbox . good luck with your endeavors .","292306":"i love animals more than most humans , so yeah .","292307":"it ll be about a minute ride as opposed to a minute ride coming home , at least . the morning commute is always much faster than the evening commute .","292308":"i personally like sunsets over sunrises , but they both are beautiful in general .","292309":"my laptop , my television , my coffee machine , the necklace i m currently wearing , and a painting my boyfriend had commissioned for me .","292310":"idk , maybe a tree fell on the office building and broke the roof and some windows so that i won t have to go to work tomorrow . lmaoo . i enjoy my job , but i m so burnt out these days . and i ve been training a new employee all week , so it s been difficult for me to get my own work done . i just need a break .","292311":"i try , but it doesn t always work . it depends entirely on my mood that day .","292312":"yes , that happens quite often actually most recently , with me being promoted and then getting approved for the house .","292313":"i m not really all that shy because i don t mind talking when i have to , but i generally prefer not to speak if i m around people i m not familiar with .","292314":"i took driving courses when i was in high school , and then again during the summer prior to my sophomore year of college .","292315":"yes , that s how i m currently feeling . i haven t had a severe depressive episode in many months , so i d like to believe that it s in partial remission .","292316":"sometimes i do , sometimes i don t . it really all depends on my mood that particular day .","292317":"? ? ? no . depression is a medical disorder . you wouldn t tell someone that there s a purpose behind them having heart disease , so you also wouldn t tell someone that there s a purpose behind their depression .","292318":"depression and anxiety cannot really be cured in the typical sense . they re disorders that can be treated with various modalities , such as medication and behavioral therapy , and it is possible for them to go into remission .","292319":"this is accurate . but there s a difference between logically looking at something and seeing all of the potential angles , and then expecting the worst out of situations where often times you don t see positive aspects of the situation at all .","292320":"lol , unfortunately it does not that would be very convenient , though .","292321":"it s just simply how some people are , it isn t a conscious choice to overthink situations . if that was the case , then most people certainly wouldn t purposely choose to think the worst of situations , lol . for myself personally , my anxiety disorder causes me to overthink and come to irrational conclusions . for others , it doesn t necessarily have to be a mental illness thing , it could just be part of who they are as a human being .","292322":"if someone is expecting the worst of a situation , that means that they expect every negative outcome to happen . for instance , if a person develops a cough and they have the tendency to expect the worst , they may actually convince themselves that they re sicker than they actually are , maybe with bronchitis or pneumonia , instead of just thinking it s an insignificant cold .","292323":"no , depression mainly affects my actual mood and the way i view myself . if i m looking at the negative aspect of other things , it s generally due to my anxiety and my anxiety s way of expecting the worst out of every situation .","292324":"well , yeah . depression is a disorder and it isn t just a state of mind , so that will always override my own will to live if i m in a wave of depression .","292325":"no , i m not an inherently happy individual because of my longstanding history with depression .","292326":"yes , this has happened to me on plenty of occasions .","292327":"although it isn t something you re not used to doing , i can wholeheartedly assure you that using the singular they is both respectful and grammatically correct .","292328":"making a six figure salary would be lovely .","292329":"whenever i m at a party , someone usually brings a board game or something like cards against humanity cah is really fun , it s one of my favorite games to play with a crowd of people . as for food , going for simple snacks like chips and dip always works out well .","292330":"two people who are unapologetically themselves around each other , who can tell each other stories and secrets without fear of judgment , who accept each other for who they are , who have fun and laugh heartily around each other even when doing absolutely nothing , and who hold each other accountable for their actions .","292331":"cont . . . term . i don t know how to ask without sounding weird since they clearly want to go by a different name . a lot of what they ve said sounds like the person i know though . they also haven t talked about being that person either . no , that isn t really a bpd thing , although i can see where you may make that inference because one of the symptoms of having bpd is having little to no sense of self or a stable , concrete personality . i only know a select few people with bpd who go by a different name than their birth name , but it has no correlation with bpd itself .","292332":"i m perfectly fine with doing nothing most of the time , so it wouldn t personally bother me . i m much more content with staying in and having a glass of wine and watching mindless television with a close friend instead of going out .","292333":"cont . . . judge because a lot of people in america move out as soon as they can when my family just do not believe in that . i am glad to see i am not the only one who is still living with my parents and other family member . well , my living situation hasn t really been by my own choice , lol . i would have moved on years upon years ago if i had the finances to afford renting an apartment by myself . it s only recently with my past two promotions that i ve actually been able to save up enough money to move out on my own . i appreciate the sentiment , though . it s relatively common on long island for adults to still live with their parents in their s and even s because of how expensive it is to start an independent life here .","292334":"i have to run some errands mainly go to the bank and then pick up my medication , do laundry , and then i want to start organizing my belongings for the move .","292335":"the location i . e . how close it is to our jobs and grocery stores , whether or not they allow pets , the look and functionality of the house itself , what sort of heating and air conditioning there is , whether or not the landlord lives in the house with us , etc etc .","292336":"yeah , but i don t really adhere to micro attractions like that . i think it s silly .","292337":"with my boyfriend s truck . i m not taking most of my furniture , half of the things i own are broken so i ll need to buy new ones .","292338":"i hardly do that anymore to begin with , lol .","292339":"my close friend is straight and i believe his brother is bisexual .","292340":"not comfortably , lmao . i m making enough money to afford my bills , rent , groceries and utilities with some extra spending cash on the side not by much though . however , i m going to pick up some freelance work on the weekends again so that will definitely help out .","292341":"no , i m bisexual .","292342":"i m honestly not sure . i feel bad putting all of the responsibility to care for my mother on my father , but i can t live with them anymore . they might have to hire an at home aide .","292343":"i explained how they reacted a few minutes ago . and no , i won t miss them . i don t have a good relationship with my parents .","292344":"i m a senior editor at a publishing company .","292345":"yeah , i use cash sometimes .","292346":"honestly , they seemed disappointed or worried but were outwardly supportive . they know i need to move out and establish my own life , there s nothing they can do to stop that .","292347":"yes , i told them when i first started looking for apartments with my friend about two months ago .","292348":"not all contact , no . especially considering i m only moving a few towns away .","292349":"i m just going to take that stuff with me to hang up in my new bedroom , lol . it won t be gone forever .","292350":"everyone follow morgan s new page ! !","292351":"my day was fine . i trained someone for most of the day at work and then i scheduled an appointment to sign the lease for the apartment i m renting . then i hung out with my one friend for an hour or two . nothing too out of the ordinary .","292352":"i keep getting error messages too . it s why i haven t been on all night .","292353":"oh jeez . i know about the statistics and that wouldn t happen with these particular individuals . trust me on this .","292354":"i would say all sports , but i don t even like watching sports either , lol .","292355":"my bed .","292356":"i prefer eating at home most days , it s less expensive than going to a restaurant .","292357":"i last took a photo with or of my coworkers at the work cocktail party i went to last saturday .","292358":"the halo odst soundtrack , heavy rain , and thunder . https www . youtube . com watch ? v mzjjzeephfm t s","292359":"no , there s no object that i would risk my life to save . material items are mostly replaceable , it isn t worth risking my life to save something when i have almost no emotional attachments to my possessions .","292360":"it was one of those crappy flip phones from the early s , haha . i only had a certain number of texts i could send and receive per day , minutes at night were free , and the screen was black and white .","292361":"yes , i ve been wearing glasses since i was a toddler .","292362":"my job , ugh . i wake up at am every morning to get ready for work , so work is normally the first thing on my mind .","292363":"a vacation , haha .

surprisingly i ve never watched that show .","292366":"i m sorry you feel that way . rest assured that isn t how i approach my friendships , nor do my friends approach me in that manner . my boyfriend is fully supportive and encouraging of me moving in with his best friend .","292367":"no , my body isn t anything spectacular .","292368":"well , that s your prerogative . i d much rather live with my friends than my parents . i need to move out and establish my own life .","292369":"he can t afford to move out of his house at the moment , unfortunately .","292370":"it s my close friend who i ve known for ten years and his brother , lol . it s very safe .","292371":"yes , that s one of my favorite things to do in autumn .","292372":"there s nothing wrong with having sex outside of marriage , open relationships , or polyamorous relationships .","292373":"it depends on the day . i go to bed anywhere between pm and am , and i wake up at am every day . so i normally get between hours of sleep per night .","292374":"yeah , i smoke marlboro smooths .","292375":"illegal drugs , haha . also , underage drinking .","292376":"hello do you have a question ?","292377":"depends on my mood . i like both long hair and short hair on myself , haha . i ve been growing it out long for the past year or so .","292378":"i prefer using the website over the app . it s easier and faster for me to type my

appreciate it .","292384":"the property manager and real estate agent both called me today to tell me that i got approved for renting the house ! ! we get the keys in october ! !","292385":"my current relationship is my longest relationship years .","292386":"no , most of the games i play are open world , single player rpgs . i do playing multiplayer on destiny , though .","292387":"i went out to dinner with my coworker and had delicious tacos and beer ! !","292388":"venti cold brew with sugar free vanilla syrup and soy milk .","292389":"pulled chicken tacos with red onions , peppers , avocado

.","292392":"i agree that is nothing . it isn t that , lol .","292393":"i m feeling fine . not looking forward to going into work in minutes because training new people makes me extremely anxious , though . luckily the new employee is an excellent writer and grasps the material easily .","292394":"a hell of a lot more than i have now , that s for sure .","292395":"underestimate myself

disturbing .","292399":"you re correct it isn t different from others in a general sense , but considering what we ve gone through , it would most definitely tear some other people apart . that s just realistic .","292400":"yes , i m currently in love with my boyfriend and i believe it to be true love . we ve withstood significant struggle together that normally would tear some other relationships apart , but we ve only grown stronger .","292401":"somewhat , but i don t invest as much faith in them as some others . i find researching star signs and astrology in general to be very interesting , but i don t really believe in that sort of thing .","292402":"my boyfriend s house . i feel at home there , at most peace with myself and my surroundings . there s no criticism or judgment there and i

try to build myself up again .","292404":"yes , i m quite an ambitious person when i m not going through a depressive episode at least . i normally surpass whatever goals i set for myself .","292405":"no , i m not superstitious by any means . i find them to be interesting though , especially with respect to their historical contexts .","292406":"no , i ve only ever been on a flight four times two to get down to austin , texas , and two to get back to new york . it happened within the same week , lol .","292407":"no , i don t own those .","292408":"upstate new york catskill mountains .","292409":"lol , no . at least not for me personally . it may happen to other people , but personally speaking the thoughts are simply subdued because i m living in the present moment . it has no bearing on their intensity after i ve sobered up .","292410":"the way i behaved towards certain people in my past , the harm i inflicted on them cannot be undone and i ve already come to terms with the fact that i m the villain in a lot of people s stories and will not be forgiven .","292411":"the only cartoons i like are adult oriented cartoons , like bob s burgers , bojack horseman , rick

current moments or for their future , for them to remember and feel thankful during the time that they re alive .","292413":"it can be for a variety of reasons , tbh . some people s thoughts scare them or they re toxic to their well being , especially in the case of mental illness .","292414":"no , i like remaining cognizant of my surroundings . i only get fuzzy minded when i m too high or too drunk .","292415":"it s different for everyone . for me personally , because of the strain i smoke , it happens gradually and my anxiety eases over time and i become quite content with my life and where i am in that present moment . my feeling of mindfulness increases and i m valuing my time at that second as opposed to worrying about the future or dwelling on the past .","292416":"yeah , definitely . when you re too busy doing things throughout the day , whether they re your chores or your work or whatever else , you don t have time to be alone with your thoughts .","292417":"i wouldn t smoke marijuana if i didn t like the feeling of being high , lol .","292418":"i think one of the biggest stereotypes that are actually true is that new yorkers are always in a rush . we don t stop

.","292419":"only when i m high .","292420":"sometimes , yes . for example , i can t stay up past like am anymore without feeling absolutely terrible the next day .","292421":"lol , we re generally referred to as new yorkers , not new yorkians . but yes , there are definitely stereotypes revolving around those who live in new york .","292422":"lol , no . i m not physically attracted to much of anything these days .","292423":"i think it varies depending on the individual . some people find it easier to revert back to a platonic relationship than others , and not every relationship is the same . there will always be some relationships that cannot exist outside of a romantic context for one reason or another , and instead of remaining friends , it s better for both people to remain separate . generally speaking though , it is definitely possible . i loved my best friend in a romantic context while we were dating as teenagers , and even after we broke up we remained close friends .","292424":"personally , i don t think it s very important . i believe it s more important to have a substantial impact on others in a positive light while you re still alive .","292425":"are you talking about someone s face versus someone s body ? lol . in that case , i would probably go with face . i m more attracted to people s faces than their bodies to begin with anyway , and the face expresses a lot more than someone s body does . however , i ve never really put too much emphasis on someone s physical attraction and what i find attractive is varied depending on the individual .","292426":"for the most part , yes . i recycle whenever i can and i use refillable bottles instead of plastic bottles .","292427":"i listen to music on the drive to work and on the drive home from work , so that equals out to roughly hours per day . i also sometimes listen to music when i m home for about an hour or so as well , but it isn t every day .","292428":"no , not particularly . i just believe in chance and coincidences .","292429":"it isn t something i particularly care about .","292430":"yeah , i feel like i m misunderstood a lot when i try to discuss something that s on my mind . i can t express myself verbally very well , so often what comes out of my mouth isn t necessarily what i mean to say . in addition , some people find it hard to follow my thoughts because they re usually bouncing all over the place .","292431":"no , my life hasn t been very easy however , there are obviously people out there whose lives are much harder than mine . i ve always tried to make the most out of what s been given to me , though , and i ve always persevered regardless of what i ve endured .","292432":"if i hated my boss and my coworkers , then i wouldn t be at this job anymore ,

years old , but i don t remember liking milani very much . their products were cheap , not pigmented at all , and didn t stay on very long .","292436":"yes , i m fine . i cried again minutes ago too . long story short , my boyfriend has been raising two big tanks of fish for the past years . he has no choice but to give them away now and his heart is hurting because those fish are his babies , and he needs to find them a good , reliable home . i cried because i feel so terrible and at a loss at what to do for him . i wish there was some way i could help , so i ve been asking everyone i know to see if they know trustworthy people who can adopt fish . i haven t had any luck so far .","292437":"lol , no . i m a hygienic person , so there s no reason for them to complain or make remarks .","292438":"no , i don t usually feel that strongly towards a person except for maybe two individuals in my life . if i don t like someone , then i don t involve them in my life at all .","292439":"my day was fine . i was training a new employee all afternoon , so that took up a majority of my time . i was extremely nervous to meet and train her , but she seems like a very intelligent , kind person . also , her writing is excellent which is a nice change from what i m used to seeing when i have to train new employees , lol . i m a bit sad now , though . i just received some disheartening news and i m at a loss at what to do .","292440":"thanks , much appreciated .","292441":"i prefer taking selfies over other people taking photos of me .","292442":"usually only

was the only place where we somewhat had privacy .","292452":"i knew i should have deleted the question smh . y all are gross .","292453":"lmao , yeah . my boyfriend s bedroom was actually just a corner of the basement at one point , and his bed was essentially at the bottom of the basement stairs . i can t tell you how many times his father knocked and immediately opened the basement door without giving us time to respond , lmaoo .","292454":"none , as far as i can remember .","292455":"watching television and drinking iced tea .","292456":"and though i can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable , i simply am not there . american psycho","292457":"i know absolutely nothing about this .","292458":"honesty and communication . if i m doing something wrong or i m hurting others , i want my friends to be real with me and tell me what i m doing . i don t want to befriend people who will sugarcoat the truth or put on a facade around me . i also value deep communication in that we can have stimulating conversations without judgment or fear .","292459":"my boyfriend and i broke up during my first year of college for a few months . i went on a date in that time frame upon the suggestion of my roommate . the date started off well , but as i began to realize how i still loved my boyfriend , i became more upset to where the other person noticed . i ended up breaking down and venting about the issues that were going on between me and my boyfriend , lmaoo . i still feel bad for the dude .","292460":"i overthink my interpersonal relationships and i m constantly asking people if they re mad at me , lmaoo .","292461":"settle for something less than what i deserve

from fallout and it came out absolutely magnificent .","292470":"there s always been this societal expectation for people to begin experimenting with sex from a young age . it s basically normalized

as hell by lizzo https youtu . be smbmeogwsqe","292472":"yeah , i agree with that for the most part . however , it s fairly unrealistic to expect kids not to have sex until they reach and the best thing we can do is provide a lot of education on safe sex practices for when they do decide to begin having sex .","292473":"i always feel terrible if i get absolutely no sleep it wrecks havoc on my

pets . i would also like to donate money to various charities , like jdrf , the aspca , and the national alliance on mental illness .","292492":"most people are rude to others because they re insecure with themselves and feel threatened when faced with any sort of disagreement or opposition . instead of accepting other people s opinions for what they are or opening their mind to new possibilities , they seclude themselves and act out harshly and irrationally to preserve their own sense of pride .","292493":"ingesting large amounts of coffee and alcohol in a small time period . that isn t so much

. it was just for one day , and then we drove back home at night .","292495":"i m not sure why some people get angry or annoyed , it seems like an awfully insignificant thing to get mad about . i use

.","292497":"just be yourself . the right woman will come along , and if you act like yourself then they ll begin to like the real you . you don t have to worry about behaving out of character and you

attention seeking isn t necessarily a bad thing either . what you re feeling now is very common for people who are undergoing mental health treatment , actually . your psychiatrist should treat you

couldn t believe how naive and ridiculous he sounded , but he was dead serious . am i shallow or wrong for not wanting to continue our relationship ? he and i have both discussed living on our own and having children . i ll be starting my career making decent money by age or so , and i feel like the future with him is bleak rn . he told me he makes enough to make me happy and i m like . . . you can t even support yourself . lmao . it s really sad . i don t think that s shallow , but i do understand both aspects of the scenario . on the one hand , you want someone who has the drive to better themselves and be able to fully support themselves , both emotionally and financially . especially if you throw in future plans , like building a future together , buying a home , and starting a family . if he has the ability to go out and get a decent job and live independently , he should ideally do just that . at the same time , however , money isn t everything even though it is a large part of who we are and how we define ourselves . there would hypothetically be nothing wrong with you working and him staying home and making commission off of his artwork , for example , as long as you both can afford to live that way and provide fully for your family . overall , i think it s something you have to talk about with him more deeply . he s not going to be the next davinci or whatever , and he has to understand that people still need to make a living in order to survive in this life . whether that s by him supporting you while you work and doing everything he can to make you comfortable , or by both of you contributing financially .","292580":"it s all right . after i did some research on car insurance , my friend asked me if i wanted to check out a new brewery in

.","292581":"lack of empathy a lack of openmindedness even if you don t understand something , you should try to open your mind to learning new things and adapting to them instead of outright refusing

illnesses and i ve had people treat me differently after i confided in them that i had those illnesses due to their preconceived notions of what people with those illnesses are portrayed to behave . it used to bother me , but it doesn t make a difference to me anymore . if someone wants to be in my life , they should accept me for who i am . i m not going to hide myself just because a person refuses to understand . i don t have room in my life for people who will judge others based on what something else has told them to think instead of experiencing it for themselves .","292583":"probably , but it depends on who s saying it . if someone said that to you , you should ask them to clarify .","292584":"i don t know , haha . it doesn t really sway me either way

cup of hot or iced coffee before eating dinner . then i chug water for the rest of the night , lmaoo .","292589":"i woke up around am . drove to work and worked from am to pm . drove home from work , got changed into pajamas , and made an iced coffee . cooked a quick dinner even though i haven t eaten it yet . then i was looking up car insurance policies online and getting various quotes .","292590":"that s actually one of my eventual goals , yes .","292591":"lol , the good ole snowflake defense . i haven t heard of people using that terminology in such a long time . nevertheless no , i don t believe you re too sensitive , depending on the context of the jokes at least . if the comments are flat out poking fun bullying someone else s physical appearance , then i believe it s natural for you to be angry or upset especially if it s about something a person cannot change . the only exception i can think about to that sort of thing is if the person is making fun of themselves for their physical appearance , or if someone is the butt of the joke in a group of friends but they re not bothered by the comments whatsoever . in those cases , then i don t really see the purpose

purposes . when i was younger , i was more apt to forgive and forget cheating . but now that i m approaching my s , i m looking for mature relationships with people with whom i can spend significant time . i . e . if my boyfriend cheated on me , i would likely break up with him . we ve progressed so far in our relationship and have been dating for so many years , it would be so detrimental to our relationship if one of us became unfaithful and did everything else that comes with being unfaithful , i . e . lying and whatnot . it would signify that one of us is obviously not as invested in the relationship as the other , and that sort of one sided relationship is unfair and unhealthy .","292595":"caffeinated beverages dehydrate you , are terrible for your stomach lining , and increase

conclusions about people in general . the truth is , you simply do not know someone because you haven t lived their life or experienced what they have experienced , so it would be ignorant to jump to a conclusion about a person without knowing every detail of their story .","292666":"no , i don t trust people easily at all . most people have to prove their loyalty for lack of a better term before

without warning . it s terrifying .","292668":"this may be pessimistic of me to say , but no . i don t believe global peace is attainable , especially in today s age . there are too many people in

absolutely horrid the next day .","292672":"i don t really hold an opinion about a group of people like that , lol . what i think about a person ultimately depends on their own individual behavior and opinions , not their diet or lifestyle choice .","292673":"yes , it s happened on numerous occasions . most recently , it happened today . my boyfriend and i had plans to see each other tonight when he gets out of work , but his best friend came into work clearly upset and needing to talk something through . my boyfriend asked if i wouldn t mind if he grabbed a beer with his best friend instead , so i told him to go be there for his friend . i was looking forward to seeing him , but his best friend is clearly in need and my boyfriend s time will be better spent by his side tonight .","292674":"i believe in free will out of those three subjects . i think every person has their own ability of free will , and that destiny is just a romanticized notion so that people don t feel guilty about things not working out the way they think they would .","292675":"on rainy days , i enjoy sitting in my room with quiet music playing , a candle lit , and ambient lights dimmed . it s very peaceful to me , especially with the backdrop of the sound of rain hitting the house street .","292676":"i don t believe you can really quantify something of that nature because everyone experiences love differently , including the depth of that love to begin with , so it s difficult to determine how much it can change a person . some people may be changed mildly , while others more intensely .","292677":"i don t believe in good v . evil , so i don t really have an opinion on the matter . if someone is a terrible person , though , and has committed atrocities like mass m rder or r pe , i don t believe they should be shown any mercy whatsoever .","292678":"yes , i believe there s truth in that statement . our first love sets a foundation for how we view love , whether we re conscious of it or not . we re either comparing our subsequent loves to that love or we sometimes even feel as if our first love was the one that got away .","292679":"most of the time , no . however , my job has been doing a great job at affirming my worth and establishing credit in my name for all of the hard work i ve been putting into my projects . it s a nice change from what i m used to regarding jobs , as all of the jobs i ve had in the past took advantage of their workers and never gave positive reinforcement .","292680":"last sunday , actually . after my friend and i completed the real estate application , we went out to lunch together and ordered delicious food and drinks . i felt like i was truly relaxed and living in the moment because we had just completed a monumental step in the renting process , and we deserved to have a good time afterwards .","292681":"my best friend and i met in th grade . we sat at the same lunch table and we bonded over our shared interest in music .","292682":"love at first sight doesn t exist , meanwhile lust does exist . many people confuse lust for love at first sight , because they feel an instant attraction to someone

his music or anything .","292688":"nicotine is my biggest addiction dilemma at the moment . i do desperately need to cut down on smoking , not only for my own health but also because of how much money i m laying out on cigarettes each week . i would save a lot of money by quitting smoking .","292689":"my boyfriend and i went on a date to a restaurant a month or so ago . we hardly have the time to go on legitimate dates these days because our schedules conflict so much , so it was really nice to be able to go out and indulge on good food and drinks together .","292690":"i don t believe you can make a general , blanket statement like that regarding an entire demographic of people because it s inaccurate . someone s worth or value isn t determined by their physical looks , either .","292691":"pros there are always things to do , whether in town or on the beach . most places don t close until super late , especially during the summer . you re extremely close to both manhattan and wine country . cons everything is super expensive . the cost of living is too high for most people to deal with , and as a result , most people end up moving to other states .","292692":"my forensics teacher during high school had the most substantial impact on me . he was the most real teacher i had during those years , and he confessed his shady past and ability to persevere and overcome his personal demons in order to get to where he is today . i ve always had a lot of respect for him , and i even contacted him later while i was in college when i had a personal problem that i couldn t solve on my own .","292693":"yes , i love scary stories but they do make me super paranoid , lol . i have to be around people while hearing a scary story , especially if they re rumored to

i have to have my photo taken and write an editor s letter for the publication i m in charge of . she got so happy for me and reaffirmed my value , and it made me smile knowing that someone believes in me like that .","292699":"no , cheating is almost never justified unless someone is in a dangerous or ab sive situation , and the only way for them to escape their partner is by being intimate with someone else it normally goes much deeper than that , though . if your partner has a low libido and you re not satisfied with them on a s xual level , then you need to talk to them one on one about how to treat the problem or overcome it in different ways . if it s something that you two cannot agree on , then the best thing to do is break up . cheating plays no role in this situation .","292700":"uh , honestly politicians . politicians and other governmental officials have the ability to either make or break our society .","292701":"let s not go there , lmaoo . i used to be an overbearing partner back in the day when my mental health was at its worst and i wasn t in any sort of treatment .","292702":"i was under the impression that there s a stereotype regarding men and their preference for shorter women . shorter women are generally seen as cute , quaint , and petite . taller women , on the other hand , are seen as intimidating for some reason .","292703":"i ve owned more converse shoes than vans shoes , so i suppose i ll choose converse . i haven t worn either of them in years , though .","292704":"in the next . years , i m planning on moving into an

surgical like that .","292719":"rum soaked cannoli cake .","292720":"no , generally people who have big egos have little to no power in their actual lives . there would be no reason to feel intimidated by them .","292721":"aw , thank you .","292722":"when you have a big ego , it means you have an inflated sense of self importance and have little regard for those around you primarily

so we can talk about them .","292732":"i haven t asked questions in quite a long time .","292733":"this isn t something i can give a general answer to because it ultimately depends on the relationship . for example , some people may find it better to move on entirely while others may benefit from waiting for their partner well , ex . it s something you have to sit down with your partner and discuss beforehand so that you re both on the same page .","292734":"i love bbq s , haha . it s relaxing to sit outside , grill some food , and have a few drinks with close friends or family .","292735":"no ,

strong word if someone hates children , then i would assume that they feel quite strongly about the mere presence of children , regardless of who that child is . i think it s fairly unreasonable because you haven t gotten to know that child at all and not every child is the same . however , i do understand feeling weird about children because you don t know how to communicate or relate to them . that s very much the boat i m always in .","292757":"lol , yes . i have a tendency to ramble at times , or to thoroughly explain myself when it isn t necessary .","292758":"? ? ? whoever told

cable television , though . i haven t turned my cable box on in over a year .","292764":"i ve always been indecisive on this issue because i ve heard viewpoints from both perspectives and see valid points from each . however , i think i more agree with the viewpoint that aromantic asexual people aren t necessarily part of the lgbtq community . being aromantic asexual means you simply do not feel attraction toward other people , whether romantically or sexually . it wouldn t really fall on the lgbtq scale because it s a lack of attraction , not an attraction that differs from the norm . however , i do also believe that there is discrimination and misunderstanding of people who are aromantic asexual because it s something that hasn t been studied or discussed often .","292765":"according to past studies , finland is the happiest country in the world .","292766":"these are all difficult for me , considering i ve always tried hard to be good at them and failed

just been drinking coffee and perusing social media in the meantime . my friend is supposed to come over later so that we can fill out the house rental application .","292772":"personally , i like knowing a few days in advance about plans . however , most of my plans are rather spontaneous , i . e . determined within a few hours of the plan happening rather than days or weeks . sometimes i don t know if i m up to doing something until the day it s happening , which is why i m so spontaneous with making plans with friends . i ll usually ask people if they re available the same day or night , and if they are , then we ll plan something then . if not , it isn t a big deal to me .","292773":"one should never stop learning . there s an infinite amount of knowledge out there in the world , and even if you think you know a lot about a subject , there is always more to learn . education is not limited to the classroom , and we always have the opportunity to educate ourselves on new topics or ideas .","292774":"yes , i have . i ve been jealous of friends for reaching more milestones in their lives prior to me reaching the same milestones . things like graduating from college on time , attending graduate school , getting engaged or married , buying a house , having children , getting promotions at work , etc etc . eventually , i realized that jealousy is a useless and harmful emotion and that everyone goes through life at their own pace . instead of feeling jealous of my friends , i taught myself to be genuinely happy for them because of their achievements . just because they achieved something doesn t mean that my achievements thus far are worthless .","292775":"yes , i have . when i was a teenager , i was messing around with a ouija board with a friend . we had it answer questions about the house we were in , and we later confirmed the answers with my friend s parents . during our session with the ouija board , we asked it a question and then both my friend and

you have while not only being at your destination , but also the journey to the destination itself . people normally get too comfortable staying put where they are , and they don t get to experience the amazing sensations of what you see while you re in the midst of traveling . the worst thing about traveling is other people who may make the experience terrible , haha . i also hate how much it costs to travel these days even going to upstate new york , it accrued a lot of money just in fees and tolls , and i didn t even leave the state .","292782":"i used to be prior to my first flight ! !

feel horrible living in the house with us and not contributing to rent or utilities . he has a lot of pride in that respect . i m not bothered by the situation at all and neither is he . he s extremely happy for me and my friend , and this is also going to strengthen our relationship because we will get to see each other more often .","292792":"even if i did help my boyfriend financially , it wouldn t make his bills suddenly disappear . he will still have to pay for them next month , and then the month after that , etc etc . when you re in a relationship , you support each other through difficult times . if he was in a severe bind and needed money and also asked me for it , then i would have no issue helping him financially , if it s something i could afford as well . this isn t the case right now , though .","292793":"i agree . even if i did offer to pay for his bills , he would feel horrible , guilty , and ashamed . i used to ask him in the past if he needed financial help ,

enough money to pay for myself ? he understands that and knows it s unfair . it s also not as if he s in a bad spot financially he s comfortable , he just can t lay out extra money for rent at the moment in light of his extra bills . besides , there are more ways to help someone other than giving them financial assistance . just because i don t have the money to lend to him doesn t mean i don t help him in other ways .","292796":"why would you expect me to pay for his bills ? lmaoo . i have my own bills to pay , that would be unfair .","292797":"no , that isn t genuine happiness . that s

first job as a cashier at a drug store , and every subsequent job i had at that store as well . we were all overworked and underpaid , management was not understanding at all , and the customers were

perhaps you re simply young and things like this mature as you mature yourself , and eventually you will grow out of these feelings because they ll seem meaningless to you over time . however , i can only venture a guess . i don t know you or your ex or anyone in between , but i do know that things always feel much more extreme right after a breakup than any other time . you may just need to give yourself room to breathe .","292989":"not usually , no . askfm is a mindless way for me to wind down at the end of the day .","292990":"i would like to visit england sometime during my life , but i

realizing im in love with him but also realizing i cannot force myself to go back knowing ill have so much anxiety then also kicking myself in the behind for losing someone i love over something so dumb but i literally can t bring myself to go back to him . it ll be the same thing all over again i ll feel horrible but i still love him he texts me daily and makes it so hard for me to move on . i ve been trying to focus on my life and improving my mental health and everything and this is such a big distraction idk what to do i m so torn and it makes me wanna commit su cide . please give any advice you can or input thanks if you don t want to get back together with him regardless of your reasoning , he needs to know that . texting you daily and begging you to get back together with him when he knows you two broke up is terrible , and he needs to learn those boundaries . it doesn t matter if he still loves you or not if he loves and respects you that much , then he has to respect the fact that you don t want to date him anymore . he has to do what s in your best interest his best interest . you ll find someone you can be comfortable around , to the point where you won t even question race or ethnicity because you re so deeply and utterly in love with them . this boyfriend might not be that guy for you at the moment , and that s perfectly okay . you need to fully commit yourself to yourself and your health , your mental health is your number one priority rn . i suggest you talk to your ex about him being overbearing clingy so that you don t have that guilt hanging over you , and then you can work on yourself and moving forward .","292992":"honestly ? anywhere , lmaoo . it would be nice to take an extended weekend and just book a room somewhere and do nothing

damn vacation .","292994":"cont . . . etc a lot and it just made me even more paranoid than ever . i am quite positive now she s tired of my bullsh t but is just being nice about it . well i didn t feel better after that honestly but she tells me she will be there no matter what and i honestly don t believe her that much . and it doesn t help when i go online and search friends and depression together and a lot of people is saying maybe they are just being nice and don t want to here too much stuff about negative stuff . well i m naturally negative because i have mdd and anxiety but now i don t even talk to her much about it anymore . we just talk a lot about her problems now which i m okay with , but she doesn t even ask me how are you doing when we met . just once sentence and it would have made me better but now i m in this endless loop of thinking everyone is out to get me . it sucks . just wanted to rant honestly . no worries , ranting is very healthy it s good to get all of this out of your system . i feel this hardcore , though . . . like , to basically all of my friends . i feel like i m always there for them , but then i feel guilty if i were to ever bring myself up , and they don t question it either , which makes me feel really forgotten helpless . idk . you re right , it is an endless cycle . we want friends that care for us , but we re afraid to ask them to care more for us if we re feeling neglected because we don t want to lose them entirely , and then the cycle repeats over and over . then we become afraid that they re just putting up with us because they feel bad for us or pity us , and that makes it x worse . ugh .","292995":"i only follow maybe people , and the majority of the questions most of the active users get are from accounts

my coworker who left on maternity leave a few months ago isn t returning to work to take care of her kids . my supervisor asked me if i would be comfortable administering the project i was the interim director for on a full time , permanent basis . naturally , i said yes . but honestly , i m both excited and a little nervous , knowing that this project is suddenly my whole responsibility . my supervisor said she s going to push for me to get a raise , though .","292998":"iced coffee even in the winter sometimes . i drink it every morning and sometimes in the evening when i get home from

chipped in and gifted them a few baby outfits and some diapers .","293001":"i ve always enjoyed q a sites , for some reason . before askfm existed , i was a member of formspring , which was basically the same thing as askfm i think it started up around . i like the idea of answering questions from people who want to get to know me , as well as asking questions to other people and getting to know them .","293002":"i m in my bedroom . i have two tapestries hanging , three posters an ernest hemingway quote , a signed mike shinoda poster , and a print of salvador dali s the persistence of memory

few friends who love it , though .","293008":"that s something only you can decide i can t make that determination for you , considering i don t know you or your father or your father s relationship with this woman . you should try to have a conversation with him about this first , though , if you haven t already . express that you re his child and although you two endured hardship after your mother passed away , he s still your father and you still want him to be present in your life . explain that he says he wants to have a close relationship , but his actions speak otherwise . however , when you do talk to him , try not to get accusatory or else he might respond negatively to it . try to keep an open mind , and maybe he will as well .","293009":"i don t have the ability to post video responses . in addition , i can t laugh on command , lmaoo .","293010":"lol , no . everyone is paying their own way .","293011":"cont . . . sounds stupid but i have been getting dreams and when i looked it up it all says someone around you is being fake and all . the signs of fake friendship also quite matches ours . i have anxiety and now i m paranoid and am thinking of cutting her off . i m not sure whether i m just overreacting or what . and i m not sure whether i can even bring this up to her lol i know she will probably be like wtf ? ? ? or get mad a little even if she says she won t since it seems like i don t trust her . well i don t fully trust anyone to begin with even her tbh since i have been through a lot . but please help . honestly , i m going through the same exact thing right now . one of the things that truly suck about having mental illness and anxiety is that we always question the validity of our interpersonal relationships , especially when one thing happens that sorta sets it off like your friend not asking how you are . i understand it completely , and like i said , i m going through the same thing with a friend of mine as well . i never brought it up to her because of your same worries i don t want her to think i m being ungrateful , or that i don t trust her , etc etc . it s such a weird and awkward situation to be in because we don t want to make the situation worse since we care about the friendship so much . unfortunately , i don t have much advice to give other than advising you to try to talk to your friend about these feelings , but in a discrete and kind way so that she doesn t think that you re questioning the friendship itself if that makes sense ? . maybe ask an open ended question like , hey i know this may be forward , but what do you think of our friendship ? is there anything i could be doing better as your friend ? that might open up a conversation to get you two on a better page . but take my advice with a grain of salt i don t know you or your friend , so naturally i don t know how she would react to such a conversation .","293012":"sorry i responded to this so late . in cases like these , i usually just go with my gut instinct . depending on your sense of intuition and how accurate it is , i know personally my gut instinct is rarely wrong , and if you think his stories don t line up , then those feelings are perfectly valid .","293013":"you forgot an s shootings . multiple shootings in a two day span . it s absolutely tragic and saddening . america has a problem with guns . america has a problem with domestic terrorism . to deny this is to deny reality . we need to actually do something instead of offering thoughts prayers .","293014":"my favorite class in high school was english . i really enjoyed talking ap classes in composition and literature .","293015":"yeah , plenty of people have told me that i have a very infectious laugh .","293016":"i have blue jeans on .","293017":"well , you re not entirely wrong . lol . i don t really have a deadset personality , i kinda change depending on who i m with .","293018":"because i already have enough friends , and i

teenage years , so i can imagine something traumatic happened in my childhood too . i ve always heard of memories of things like that flooding back when the person is an adult , and i m honestly terrified of that happening .","293033":"i m somewhat dreading going to work tomorrow . the weekends just don t feel long enough , especially considering i ve been running around and doing errands all weekend long . i need down time to relax before i go back to work and start the week over again .","293034":"a bacon , egg and cheese on a roll this morning , haha . my parents ordered breakfast for all of us .","293035":"people getting physically close to me or touching me , hugging me , etc etc . i ve always felt uncomfortable with those things , even around family and friends .","293036":"i wish that my friend and i can find the perfect apartment within the next few days or weeks so we can move in by the fall .","293037":"i don t think i ve ever been on a boat before , so i really don t know . the cruise i m going on next year will definitely be an eye opening experience , lol .","293038":"i m not entirely sure . it s something i ve been trying to work on in therapy , but we can t really go very far because it s not as if i ve been having breakthroughs in memory or anything . i have random snippets of memories of when i was a child , but i also can t distinguish whether they re real memories , dreams , or things i saw on video .","293039":"between and , yeah .","293040":"i ve done some terrible things to people over the years , and sometimes i do regret them because they didn t deserve it . however , there s nothing i can really do about it now so it s useless regretting the past . i just have to continue moving forward .","293041":"i can t remember the first years of my life , lol .","293042":"i don t really get annoyed with most questions , although it does disappoint me when people ask me s xual questions because it s quite obvious that i don t answer those .","293043":"no , i don t believe in karma . people who do terrible things rarely have consequences for their actions , and those who are genuinely good people normally struggle significantly .","293044":"i m very grateful for coffee . it woke me up and is motivating me to get things done today , despite the fact that all i want to do is sleep and watch television all day .","293045":"living on my own with a few pets , progressing further in my career perhaps with the same company , and possibly engaged or married .","293046":"one of the only things i do well is write , haha . i ve always had a natural ability in writing because it comes so easily to me .","293047":"aw , this is so cute ! ! thank you","293048":"i have feelings of disgust and disappointment .","293049":"plenty of foods cheese , yogurt , and spinach are the main ones .","293050":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","293051":"i would say that my gut instinct is pretty spot on , especially as i ve gotten older . i used to be fairly naive when i was younger and didn t have much intuition , but as i ve experienced more things growing up , i ve developed an effective gut instinct that s only sometimes wrong .","293052":"it depends on where you re going ! ! if you re going to a fancy restaurant , then perhaps you should wear nicer clothing , like a blouse or button down shirt with dark jeans and clean shoes . however , if you re going somewhere casual , then people can wear whatever they want .","293053":"i can , but i prefer not to .","293054":"yes , i find that it s the only one that actually tastes like sugar .","293055":"i don t remember tbh . i haven t watched a movie in a very long time . normally i just watch television shows and docu series .","293056":"usually with stevia and soy milk , although we ran out of soy milk so i m using whole milk this morning .","293057":"hello i m doing well , thank you for asking . i m just drinking coffee listening to music before i delve into cleaning later on this afternoon .","293058":"i agree with you on this . insulin for diabetics is a prime example of this . my boyfriend was on novalog for years because it was the type of insulin that helped him the most , and suddenly his insurance company decided not to cover it anymore and forced him to take humalog instead , which has not been ideal for his diabetes . it s too fast acting . there are also so many cases of young type diabetics literally dy ng because they cannot afford insulin in the united states . it s terrible .","293059":"ugh , that s terrible but unfortunately so common . an ambulance is an extra i think ? tacked onto whatever medical bills you accrue while you re at the hospital , which is so ridiculous . even new mothers who have just given birth have medical bills , and it s also so outrageous how they have to pay extra to have skin to skin contact with their baby after birth , which is so important in the beginning stages . i agree with you that health care is a human right , it s necessary to our survival . even myself personally , i pay so much money for not only my own health insurance , but also for my psychiatry visits , therapy sessions , and medication , all of which contribute to my mental health and overall my survival . and i m lucky that i found facilities that accept me because so often insurance companies don t even cover behavioral health care .","293060":"hm , this sounds like a fetish at this point . i won t be responding to any more of these messages . have a wonderful day , anon .","293061":"good ! ! i hope he s at least receptive to that message . you don t deserve a partner who will blatantly lie to your face in order to prove anything , their actions toward you alone should ideally be enough to show you that they re a good or loyal person . i agree with what you said to him .","293062":"that s not really anyone s concern . i don t go into specifics regarding my friends appearances , or even their names .","293063":"i m not too well versed on the specifics of free health care , like what exists in other countries , but health care in the united states should definitely be much more affordable . it s ridiculous how much money a person pays into not only health insurance but also doctor visits , er visits , and hospital stays despite the fact that they do have health insurance . it s a backwards system , because a lot of people end up going into massive debt from expensive medical bills , which further deters them from seeking out more medical care .","293064":"lol , no . she s my best friend now . i ve been dating my current boyfriend for years .","293065":"i ve only had one girlfriend and two boyfriends .","293066":"i ve taken the personalities test quite a few times , and i always get the result of infj , also known as the advocate . i find it s fairly accurate to me personally , but i don t know if it s accurate for other people . either way , i don t really take personality tests like those seriously because they re just out of fun to perhaps find out more about yourself . i m also sure that people can be a combination of many of those personalities .","293067":"my first kiss was with my first girlfriend at the age of years old .","293068":"communication , and perhaps more importantly , comprehension . if there s no comprehension in a relationship when you do communication , then what you re communicating will fall on deaf ears . relationships work off of a foundation of trust and communication , and you will not be able to clearly know each other s intentions or where they stand without talking to them without fear or judgment .","293069":"i don t really catch myself using slang very often at all , except for the word dude , which is a word i ve been saying to refer to others since i was a teenager , lol .","293070":"no , i ve only ever kissed my partners .","293071":"that s entirely up to the person , and it goes on a case by case basis . some people may feel closure by forgiving those who wronged them , while other people have no intentions of forgiving their enemies or ab sers , etc etc . there s also nothing wrong with choosing not to forgive someone , no one is obligated to forgive someone else if they wronged them , as long as the person has their own safety and wellbeing in mind .","293072":"cont . . . i asked him if he made it up and if he did to accomplish what exactly and he says i have no reason to lie it happens often , well not often but when i go jogging . . so i pretty much told him what i told you but just longer and he said i m glad you re doing that for yourself don t force yourself . but i still feel the need to distance myself from him bc idk , i m just super annoyed with him . i experience emotions stronger than most ppl too so perhaps it bothers me a little more than it should . your feelings are totally valid , and honestly i would feel the same way re cutting him off or distancing yourself from him . however , i also feel emotions more strongly than most people too , lmaoo . even if it was true when he s telling you , then i don t see the purpose of him even telling you those things unless he wanted to show you that he s a loyal boyfriend . it would be perfectly acceptable for those things to happen since you are on a break , but i see no reason why he should tell you this unless he had an ulterior motive .","293073":"that s entirely up to you . if you re afraid for your safety , then try talking to friends or family to get their support . if you live with him , find out if there are shelters for victims of ab se or stay with someone you know so that you re in a safe place in order to leave him . your safety is the priority here . i also just want to tell you to keep in mind that most cases of r pe don t work out in favor of the victim , unfortunately , in terms of legal things . it s unfortunate and so wrong but it s the truth . it may turn out worse for you unless you have physical proof of the incidents . either way take care of yourself . i m always here for you .","293074":"english literature or creative writing . they ve always been a passion of mine and i majored in writing and minored in english literature when i was in college .","293075":"parks recreation ! ! it s one of my favorite shows and i was so sad when it ended .","293076":"i hope you realize that s r pe . nobody should be forcing you to have sex with them , even your own partner . you need to find the courage to leave him because you do not deserve to be in such a predicament , you need someone who will respect your boundaries and not take advantage of you like that . it doesn t matter if he s your boyfriend or not , it s still r pe and it s utterly wrong . you deserve better than that , i hope you understand this . especially if it s affecting your mental health and self esteem . i m so sorry you re going through this .","293077":"new hampshire . my best friend lives up there now , and i m sure she would help me find an apartment so that i could start a new life from scratch .","293078":"honestly , the best way to figure out if someone is interested in you is to simply ask them and be honest about your feelings . sit them down and tell them how you feel , and then inquire about whether or not they reciprocate those feelings . if they don t , then at least you have that closure and can move on from them to pursue something someone else .","293079":"i m all right not too great , but not terrible either . i woke up with a horrible headache it woke me up out of a dead sleep at am , but now it feels much better after drinking some water and taking ibuprofen . i m also extremely exhausted , probably from all of the running around i did yesterday , lmaoo . i woke up at am yesterday morning and ended up doing three loads of laundry before pm , i ran all of my errands before noon , i went out with my friend to a real estate office and then grabbed lunch , i did another load of laundry when i got back home , and then i basically passed out in my bed after drinking only one spiked seltzer because of how tired i was , lol .","293080":"cont . . . it s been going on for a while it s only draining me making things worse . i told him we may end up together again , we may not . so the other night he sends me a text saying while he was out jogging , he supposedly encountered a woman who told him he was hot af asked if he wanted to hang out . to which he replied he has a gf at home we don t even live together and she said oh she won t mind . and he goes yes she will , i love her things aren t well rn but i m only for her . and the girl says omg i wish i had a man like you you re an angel , see you around . the story sounds like bs to me . . what do you think ? i feel like he made it up in another attempt to manipulate me into jumping back into his arms again in awe , even though he said it apparently happens everytime he goes out jogging he s shared a story with me like that before . so yeah , i was angry jealous so but i m also questioning the validity of the story so it backfired on him . now i just wanna cut him off tbh . i m just annoyed with him but i m worried i might miss him down the line . what do you think i should do ? thx sorry this was so long ! appreciate it no worries about the story being long ! ! it helps me understand things more clearly . i just want to preface this by saying i don t know your boyfriend , so i don t know his personality or if he s the type of person to fabricate stories like that . however , upon reading this for the first time , it did sound to me like he made that jogging story up to sorta prove to you that he s a good , loyal boyfriend . i can t exactly imagine a woman randomly stopping her run to tell a stranger that he s attractive . most people i know take their exercising seriously and don t want anything to do with other people when they re jogging in public . however , i understand you feeling annoyed by this because i would most definitely feel the same way if i was in your circumstance . depending on how close you two currently are , would it be appropriate you think for you to call him out on his behavior ? basically saying , did you make up that story in an attempt to prove your loyalty and win me back ? depending on the person , it may not be a good idea but it s just . . . something to think about . either way , there needs to be communication between you two . i know you said that you told him that you two might not get back together , which is good , but it doesn t seem like he really understands that . if you haven t tried already , perhaps try talking to him about these things again and if he tries pulling the same sh t then maybe think about leaving . nobody should try to guilt you back into a relationship , that s wrong and manipulative .","293081":"my next tattoo is going to be a writing quill , and i want it on my right forearm .","293082":"i like starting off my mornings with a cigarette and a fresh pot of coffee .","293083":"uh , well i certainly hope my future spouse is my current boyfriend .","293084":"sometimes i make sound effects instead of speaking real words , lmao . i m always meeping , squeaking , etc etc .","293085":"honestly , i would probably use that extra hour to sleep . i can always sleep regardless of what time of day it is .","293086":"of course","293087":"no , i m actually quite looking forward to the future . i have a lot of hope in my future lately , and things can only improve from here .","293088":"clean the house , which only really includes dusting the furniture and vacuuming today . i might wipe down the bathroom too .","293089":"i m five feet tall , lol . i don t have any full body photos of myself .","293090":"i m not sure , we weren t able to talk to anyone unfortunately . that would have been one of the questions we would ask , haha .","293091":"i don t normally answer questions about sex , but yes . lmaoo . it was my boyfriend s futon , it happened quite a few years ago . the entire frame just collapsed under us , it was hilarious .","293092":"i honestly don t remember , the last time that happened was when i was working two jobs for about two months . i don t know how many days i worked in a row , i worked monday through friday in an office and then i worked in retail most weekends always saturdays , occasionally i ll take a sunday off .","293093":"venti cold brew with sugar free vanilla syrup soy milk .","293094":"i got my first laptop when i was years old , i used it when i first attended college .","293095":"nothing much really . i went to a real estate office and then went out to lunch with my friend earlier this afternoon , then i went home and took a nap . i ve just been relaxing since then , took a trip to to buy spiked seltzer and here i am .","293096":"i ve never tried or even wanted to , so i really don t know .","293097":"my current relationship years .","293098":"uh , maybe tmi ? one of the bartenders who serves me drinks occasionally appeared in my dream and he sh t in my hand . i was very confused when i woke up .","293099":"lol i have less than followers on twitter , so i really have no idea .","293100":"that sounds like a good idea to me , as long as you have the means of finding one and affording one . i ve never seen a psychologist before , only a psychiatrist , but she did diagnose me after speaking to her in depth about my experiences and feelings . she prescribed me antidepressants to start and then we kept experimenting with different things until we found a combination that worked for my symptoms .","293101":"ugh , i know . it s so difficult buying clothes when every store has a different idea of what sizing is .","293102":"yes , i have health insurance that i pay into each week and a copay for my appointments .","293103":"i don

lengths in order to achieve it . i m very determined when i have my mind set on something .","293107":"i would rather be confident in who i am . having a partner is nice , but your own self confidence is more important . people in your life come and go , but you have to live with yourself every day .","293108":"in the past , i tried to change how other people perceived me . however , it s nearly impossible to alter how other people see you because people will always have their minds set on what they believe , regardless of what we do to try to change their minds . over time , i learned that it truly doesn t matter what people think about me , and the only opinions i should take into consideration are those of my close friends and boyfriend as well as my own opinion of myself , obviously .","293109":"people expected me to react positively to getting my driver s license when i was years old , but honestly , i was absolutely terrified to drive and didn t even want my license in the first place .","293110":"no . saying all is absolute , and nothing really exists that encompasses everyone in one specific group of people . there will always be people who don t wear the right size dresses and or bras , and it s actually quite common for a person to wear the wrong size because they don t know that another size might fit them better .","293111":"not very often , lol . i m not a very happy or cheery person , so i only smile when something makes me laugh .","293112":"i like keeping the blinds on the windows open so i can see the rain coming down outside . i light a candy and put my ambient lights on in my room and usually have a cup of hot coffee or tea while watching television or listening to music .","293113":"nothing is set in stone , but i hope that my close friend and i can find an apartment by the end of august so that we can move in sometime in september or october .","293114":"honestly , july flew by and the entire month seems like a blur . the few good things that i believe happened in july was that i lost a little bit more weight and increased my stamina , and i partnered with a close friend so that we can find an apartment together .","293115":"i don t like chocolate very much , so neither .","293116":"my keys , lmaoo . i had too much stuff in my hands coming into the house earlier this morning and i dropped my keys on the ground while trying to unlock the front door .","293117":"my phone , cigarettes , and money . i don t really need much else unless i m driving somewhere , in which case i always have my keys and driver s license on me .","293118":"considering i need money to live , no . i would be absolutely miserable if i didn t have money . i would be behind on my bills , i wouldn t be able to afford my medication and psychiatric treatment , and when i move into an apartment , i won t be able to afford rent .","293119":"witnessing a loved one struggle with drug addiction and overdose .","293120":"i believe that s x education should be taught in public schools , as well as taught by the students parents . the lack of s x education in schools only leads to further misunderstanding of safe s x and stis stds , which increases the risk of teen pregnancy . there s nothing wrong with having knowledge about practicing s x and being responsible with it .","293121":"three challenges work myself up to . miles of walking per day . get back into reading regularly . get over my fear of driving going to new places .","293122":"having a hot mug of coffee at the end of my work day . sitting outside when it s cool and breezy . laying down in my bed with ambient lights and soft music playing .","293123":"my ultimate goal is to attain a level of independence and happiness . i know that happiness is a journey in itself , so really i suppose my goal is to embark on that journey through being independent and living in the present moment .","293124":"the only language i can speak is english .","293125":"uh , yeah . considering i m years old and have been with my boyfriend for years .","293126":"seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile . watching videos of cute animals . watching hilarious television shows . being out on the docks or water during sunset .","293127":"i don t know much about the current relationship between the united states and russia , but the united states and russia were allies during world war ii . i m sure a lot of people either aren t aware of that or forgot .","293128":"yes , it was delicious . for breakfast just now , i ate a power breakfast sandwich from dunkin . egg whites with spinach , tomatoes and onions , a sausage patty , and cheese on a multigrain flatbread .","293129":"yeah , i ve sent a text to the wrong person a few times , lol . thankfully , it was nothing major and we both had a good laugh out of it . i never have a lot of notifications on my phone , so that has never happened to me .","293130":"no , i don t have any pets at the moment . i used to have a german shepherd , as well as two fish .","293131":"probably minutes at the most . i normally wake up without feeling very groggy unless i went to bed late the night before . i normally get between hours of sleep .","293132":"lately i ve really been enjoying the phrase tre toujours ivre . it comes from charles baudelaire s poem get drunk , and it means that one should always be drunk on life , on love , on their passions , on anything that brings happiness to their soul .","293133":"last night for dinner , i had grilled salmon , brown rice with vegetables , and a tomato mozzarella salad .","293134":"spinach ! ! i could eat it every day .","293135":"i believe makeup is a great form of self expression and a way of making people feel better about themselves . there s nothing wrong with using makeup , and it certainly doesn t mean that someone is fake or giving off the wrong impression to others .","293136":"trolling messages . when i was younger and more naive , i used to entertain them or answer them seriously . however , over the course of the past few years , i learned that it isn t worth giving those messages any attention . i m quite intolerant of them and i think they re a waste of time .","293137":"i haven t read a book in a month or two . the last book i was reading i only got maybe pages into it was game of thrones by george r . r . martin .","293138":"is heathers considered a high school movie ? it takes place in a high school , haha .","293139":"i said to my boyfriend , i m sure , i can imagine you re running around like crazy . he told me that one of his coworkers was hours late , and there were also call outs . he was the closing manager on duty last night so things were so busy and ridiculous . he didn t get home until pm .","293140":"i literally have no idea . i also haven t visited the eye doctor in three years .","293141":"i talked to my boyfriend on the phone last night before i went to bed . he was taking a brief break at work and called me because we haven t spoken on the phone in two days or so .","293142":"my medication , coffee , and music .","293143":"in my opinion , i believe the most popular lie people tell is that they re fine or that they re not struggling . most people are struggling in some aspect or another , but because we don t want to feel like a burden or have people feel bad for us , we don t tell the truth and end up coping with our struggles alone .","293144":"bob s burgers , futurama , bojack horseman , and big mouth .","293145":"lol , no . i work in an office building .","293146":"i have a laptop , but not a
