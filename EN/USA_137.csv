734973,"
   even if they find them attractive, if they try to go after them they're sick imo . they're literally YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE YOUR CHILD. the mindsets are just too different. people just have no common sense. plus her man literally is a pxdo so idk why people even have a problem
  ","
  cuz they’re just trynna justify actions of pedos tbh . which is sick and makes me believe they are.
  
  no man in their 40’s should be looking or acting upon a woman in her 20’s . and that anon is forgetting her husband dated // married an underage girl before

734974,"

  ","
  maybe you’re the pedo .

  and she thinks that’s acceptable . just like how she said she would let her 15 year old daughter date someone who’s 30 then changed her whole opinion yesterday cuz everyone was telling her ; that’s nasty and pedo behavior just like her hubby. that’s why it doesn’t surprise me. i feel bad for her kids. she’d allow underage men to date//marry then ☹️

   I agree you should've used protection to be safe honestly. So I see where people are coming from. If I had unplanned pregnancies I would start using it. BUT, giving a child up doesn't make you a bad person or a deadbeat. You just chose to give her better than what you had. People need to relax.
  ","
  i don’t care where people are coming from. tbh you can’t say i’m a shxtty mom or anything cuz i take care of what’s mine. a shxtty parent is someone who a*use their kids , starve them and such . FOH lmao .

   2/2 Too bad her future has gone no where, she lost whatever potential she had and she’s basically paid for ding dong ditching houses with dropping food off. She should leave someone who did the responsible thing and got a kid put with family instead of projecting her obvious guilt and Mommy issues

   Marissa likes thinking nothing gets to her but here are some facts. She didn’t even keep a pregnancy because she chose to abort as a teenager. She likes to say women once they get their period are ready for pregnancy so whats her excuse? Oh wait, the impact it would have on her future. 1/2

   They're the same sort to be ""pro life"" and tell people to put children up for adoption instead of terminating yet when someone makes an adoption-like situation, they bash on the mother then too.

737121,"
   I agree w you about the age gap thing , everyone says ""as long as you're over 18 who cares"" but I think it's weird when men who are 25+ date people fresh out of high school // under 21. Then there's those middle aged guys who specifically go after women in their 20s & below & it's like .. no. ✋🏼
  ","
  Idc what ppl say age is a NUMBER. You can’t date someone who’s like 7 or 10 years older than you. Someone who’s 23 dating someone who’s 30 isn’t going to work well imo. Different mindsets , different paths in life.

   Not even as a symbol of love and commitment?
  ","
  No. Imo you should be dating for a year or longer in order to receive a promise ring or a engagement ring. Ppl rush into things cuz they love the “honey moon phase.” Till it knocks them on their butt & their relationship is over & done with. Some ppl just love the idea of love // that person.

  ","
  I don’t give a fxck .
  "
737742,"
   Not on any of the dates, but after several, after seeing if they like each other, after getting to know themselves. Then when the guy feels ready and the girl as well, then the guy asks the girl to be his girlfriend, the ring would be a symbol of his commitment and love.
  ","
  Imo giving someone a ring in less then a year is weird // odd. You don’t know a person in less than a year . Idc of your knee them before that. Cuz knowing someone for years & dating is different & everyone acts differently when dating
  "
737743,"
   You are wrong, im girl 😁

  30 weeks- Uh , I woke up to use the bathroom (7:15amish). I started to bleed & I was freaking out. My fiancé said “oh it’s nothing you’ll be alright”. & my mom had just left for work. So I called her. She turned back around & we went to the hospital. Wasn’t the one my obgyn is at cuz that hospital was about 30 minutes . The one I went to was about 10 minutes. So I’m sitting in the waiting room while they fax and gather my info. ( mind you I’m bleeding , having contractions... which I didn’t feel... but anyways . After that I get a room. They hook me up & on the screen my contractions were intense according to my fiancé. They check me and I was already 6cm dilated. So I had to have an emergency c section.

  For 1 idek why he would think of you cheating or not caring if he did ; ( not saying you would) honestly if he says he doesn’t “care” then he needs to cut the shxt and be on board. If he “cares” he needs to tell you so you guys can come to an agreement!

   if a man gets a woman pregnant then decides he does not wish to be a father, does he still have an obligation to help support//raise that child? if women have the option of abortion, should men at least be able to opt out of the child's life? what are your thoughts?
  ","
  If a man gets a girl pregnant and it just happened & wasn’t planned? Then sure he has rights to leave . Doesn’t make it right . But you shouldn’t force a man to be a parent just like you can’t force a mom to be one either. And if abortion is an option they discussed & she doesn’t want to do it but he does. Sure he has every right to leave cuz he told her flat out get an abortion & she didn’t

   But that’s the point in wrestling, hence “entertainment” that’s why you get people like Dwayne Johnson, John Cena, Steve Austin etc who go on to act in movies because they’re actors.

The whole reason it’s the way it is is because the injury’s involved in that type of sport.
