october . it was a fun weekend and i felt very relaxed and at peace .","266586":"i don t really think that s possible because there will always be people who thrive off of drama , whether it involves them or not .","266587":"they have faith in something despite the lack of physical or scientific proof .","266588":"drama free means the absence of drama such as people not caring about other people s

trolling questions and statements that are not questions at all . i also delete s xual questions because they re inappropriate , as well as questions where my answer is just a simple no with no other explanation .","266643":"it depends on the individual . some people like therapy better in person , while others prefer video appointments . obviously during covid , most therapy sessions over the past year have been video appointments . i prefer video appointments better , simply because my therapist s office is like a minute drive away and it s just easier for me to talk to her via video

cerave foaming facial cleanser just used it for the first time about minutes ago . i m hoping it ll eventually unclog my pores , keep my skin from getting very oily , and even out my skin tone .","266723":"likely because they re insecure with themselves .","266724":"i don t have sympathy for people with such blatant disregard for not only their own safety , but the safety of others

take a look when i go to the drug store later .","266740":"that makes a lot of sense , and tbh that has happened to me in the past , which made me hesitant to even use lotion in the first place . i haven t been using any cleanser or lotion for the past few months , but now it s definitely catching up to me . i have dry patches as well as oily patches .","266741":"lol , makes sense . but if that cleanser works and takes away the oil , that s exactly what i need . i always wake up every morning with such an oily face and it gets oily throughout the day , even when i m not doing anything

.","266747":"either askfm or instagram , haha . askfm i like answering questions most of all , as well as getting to know the people i follow whom i consider to be friends . asking others questions is

.","266748":"i ve been all right . today is my last day of quarantine , so i can finally go out and run the errands i need to run . i woke up at am and heard my roommates talking , and when i talked

items later .","266749":"i have two roommates .","266750":"no , those people were simply protesting and not storming the united states capitol .","266751":"it took me several years as in , like . . . from when i was a pre teen to my early s to realize that my intense mood swings , depressive episodes , and mania were definitely not normal and were indicative of mental illness .","266752":"no , i used to do it when i lived with my parents . but now that i live on my own , i have no reason to keep snacks in my room .","266753":"black craft cult and torrid .","266754":"uh , probably caffeine

.","266757":"i ve always wanted to sneak a photo of one of my cats while he s sitting down with his paws crossed and then put that ah , what a distinguished gentleman sound over it as a tiktok , lmaoo .","266758":"success shouldn t be measured by how much money you have , or if you re married or single , or if you have children or not . on the other hand , i think success should be measured by how happy you are with yourself and your life despite those standards .","266759":"i think it ultimately depends on the person sometimes they really do affect a person s confidence levels , knowing they look more attractive using filters and if they begin to feel extra bad about how they actually look . however , i think for most people , it s just a way of expressing themselves and to have a bit of fun . for example , i know that snapchat filters thin out my face and make my facial structure more prominent and smooths my skin , of course . i like using those filters because they do make me feel better about myself , but i m also aware that it isn t what i actually look like and it doesn t affect my view of myself at all .","266760":"i was alive during the s , but i wish i was older whether a teenager or young adult during those times so i could experience the music scene and the overall culture of the s .","266761":"in , i learned that i needed to gain more patience and also focus more on my mental health instead of working myself to the bone . i ve learned to not blame myself or be too hard on myself if i need a mental health day away from work .","266762":"the familiarity of it all and the fear of change , most likely . which is very common you re not the only person who experiences this .","266763":"my entire life is one awkward mess , so probably anything that i ve said . lmaoo .","266764":"haha ! ! that s really cute , actually . i ve also seen my friends do like . . . high fives , but with their feet . lmao .","266765":"yes , particularly video games . they ve always been a source of comfort and escapism for me even when i was very young .","266766":"that s definitely true i honestly would never do that in a million years , covid or not , haha . hell , i even hate shaking hands with people .","266767":"yeah , but usually it was only loose singles , haha .","266768":"i m the same way as you i m not a touchy person either , i absolutely hate being touched and sometimes i don t even like being hugged by my friends . it was different when i was in a relationship , of course , but in terms of my platonic relationships , i m not a hugger or anything else .","266769":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","266770":"at the same time , however , greeting friends and family with kissing them such as on the cheeks is normalized in other cultures . i m not sure if that s what the anon was implying , though .","266771":"i would rather be respected as opposed to liked . you can dislike someone , but still respect them . i don t care if people dislike me or not , but respect is very important to me .","266772":"i wouldn t be surprised if i did , lmao .","266773":"i can t really say much without being labeled as a hypocrite because i did hook up with someone during the summer , haha . i probably shouldn t have done it , but it is what it is .","266774":"i can t narrow it down to just one because i love so many different kinds of music . i like alternative rock , nu metal , classical music , gaming television movie soundtracks , hip hop , some pop music , metal , etc etc .","266775":"considering we re in the middle of a pandemic , i d rather stay home . although tbh , because of the fact that i ve been home for so long , i don t really have much of a desire to go out and do things anymore .","266776":"probably my belief that there are more than two genders , and that gender pretty much exists on a spectrum as opposed to having a definitive number .","266777":"i ll honestly be surprised if askfm is still around in four years , tbh .","266778":"i say hi .","266779":"i ve never used either .","266780":"no , i don t . well , besides her but that was a different situation , rofl .","266781":"obviously i m not going to satisfy your desire , so you might as well just leave . in the meantime , i suggest you talk to someone . i m concerned for your health .","266782":"yes , i drink .","266783":"okay , i m being completely direct and serious here are you okay ? this is like the third or fourth time you ve reiterated this question word for word , and i m concerned for your mental health .","266784":"this a whole level of obsession that i ve honestly never seen before , hot damn . thanks for letting me know your intentions , though .","266785":"you sound like a broken record . are you okay

am on my phone . i m just not an emoji sort of person , haha .","266789":"confide in someone who s close to you so that you don t feel alone in your struggles , and if possible , talk to someone like a teacher or a counselor so that you have a support system . i would also say to stand up against the bully and stand your ground , but sometimes that may make the situation worse instead of better . it all depends on the situation .","266790":"does alcohol count ? haha .","266791":"i don t believe i have , no .","266792":"mostly , yes . i find it easier to answer questions when i m typing on my laptop as opposed to typing on my phone .","266793":"honestly , yeah . i would probably remember the overall idea of it , but not any details .","266794":"yes , it has happened to me in the past . fortunately , i m not in that environment anymore .","266795":"yes , i have an hp laptop .","266796":"i only really enjoy attention from my friends , haha .","266797":"i ve traveled very briefly . the

.","266803":"not everything is subjective , no . scientific facts and evidence , for example , are not subjective .","266804":"no , that doesn t help someone to educate themselves at all . in those types of cases , if you re shaming or being rude to someone , then they re more likely to be resistant to becoming more educated on a subject .","266805":"i m polite until given a reason not to be .","266806":"yes , i love mushrooms .","266807":"i don t think it s a mistake or really wrong to express your vulnerabilities , as long as you re comfortable doing so . in that regard , if someone tries to leverage those vulnerabilites in an effort to hurt you , because you were comfortable expressing them to begin with , it likely won t hurt you either way because you posted them on social media for a reason .","266808":"you re anonymous and a complete stranger . your insistence that you re right means nothing to me .","266809":"i m not sorry because she had it coming to her in participating in what can be seen as as a domestic terrorist event .","266810":"amazon and etsy , at least when it comes to gifts for the holidays and my friends birthdays .","266811":"i think this

happening in dc because people literally stormed the capitol , putting several congresspeople s lives in danger , including pence as well . all because they can t accept the fact that trump lost the election .","266980":"i don t condone violence . but the fact that officers who are there have been letting people in , taking photos with them , and generally acted peaceful means they should have behaved the same way during the blm protests . there s no excuse .","266981":"absolutely .","266982":"no worries ! ! i just watched the video . that s so ridiculous .","266983":"i don t click links on

supporters are protesting biden s victory in the election , and they re storming the capitol and causing wreck and havoc ? where are their masks , first of all ? where is the tear gas ? where are the bullets ? why aren t these people being treated like the left was during the blm protests in ? these trump supporters are acting worse than the blm protesters ever acted , and they re not being treated nearly as poorly or even poorly at all compared to what the left endured in . absolutely despicable .","266993":"nah , i know there are people who dislike me . there s no need for me to wonder

long you re in certain programs , whether your mouse is moving or not which sometimes makes me nervous when i m proofreading because i m just reading and not necessarily moving anything , what websites you visit just in case they re not related to work , etc . it s pretty involved and scared me at first , but i don t do anything unprofessional at work so i ve gotten used to it .","267140":"yeah , on a few occasions .","267141":"they have a program that tracks active time vs . idle time through the remote system that we use . we also have a daily timesheet that we fill out .","267142":"popcorn .","267143":"i miss having blue hair sm .","267144":"i have a headache my chest hurts slightly , but it feels better now that i had laid down in bed for about an hour . i think i m just stressed over tired . i don t want to call it an early night because i m not looking forward to work tomorrow , but all i want to do is sleep .","267145":"both , in a weird sense . i believe we re deteriorating socially and politically , but in terms of science and technology and medicine , we re advancing rapidly .","267146":"he s told you that in confidence and trusts you , which does mean a lot . i think you re doing the right thing . if he needs extra help , he ll come forward to you .","267147":"wake up , take my morning medication , eat breakfast and make coffee , log into work , work for the next hours while doing some household cleaning on my breaks , log out of work , take my evening medication , eat dinner , and watch television and or play video games .","267148":"no , the publishing field .","267149":"i wasn t implying that at all .","267150":"because they re anonymous strangers who have zero insight into my life , lol .","267151":"i m in the united states .","267152":"flying , i suppose . i don t need strength in my every day life .","267153":"no , they don t affect me at all .","267154":"idk , i only follow like people so that isn t a big comparison to the thousands of other people who use askfm .","267155":"nope , but i m getting better .","267156":"no , i don t like horror games because they scare the crap out of me , lol . i had a hard enough time watching my ex play outlast .","267157":"i always write things down so that i don t forget them . i have a really terrible short term and long term memory , so i m constantly writing things down .","267158":"yes , playing video games is one of my favorite hobbies .","267159":"i have the unfortunate habit of pressing them down inside of me until they get too overwhelming and i tend to explode , which either comes out as a manic or a depressive episode . i deal with them in pretty unhealthy manners as well , which is something i do want to start working on more actively .","267160":"not at all . i ve hung out with both of them on multiple occasions .","267161":"no , she understands that he and i are very close friends and she respects me .","267162":"it most definitely was real love , and the deepest love i have ever felt . despite us not being together in a romantic context , he still has a special place in my heart , which is why we agreed to continue being in each other s lives . our feelings are mutual . time heals , as well as engaging in other things that bring enjoyment in life . for me personally , i focused more on my work , on my hobbies , and on my friends .","267163":"thank you","267164":"well , i got my phone after we broke up , so no . lol .","267165":"i already posted this video earlier this afternoon , but this is what i ve been watching listening to for the past two hours https www . youtube . com watch ? v xcmmmdjpeec t s","267166":"yeah , i don t have much romantic feelings towards my ex anymore , and i value and appreciate the friendship we have fostered over the past year and change since we ve broken up .","267167":"i appreciate your opinion , and we can agree to disagree .","267168":"i never took any with my own phone .","267169":"no , writing is my easiest method by which i can organize and express my thoughts .","267170":"no , i don t believe all humans are inherently selfish , although a good majority of them are .","267171":"it didn t sway me either way because i was concrete in my belief that he was faithful to me . i didn t usually flirt with other people when i was in a relationship because i m too awkward to even get to that point even now that i m single , i m still too awkward to flirt .","267172":"for the most part , yes . everyone has judged someone to a certain extent at least once in their lives , whether they realized it or not . what s more important , however , is realizing that you have judged someone based on superficial appearance or behavior and trying to correct yourself .","267173":"yeah , years upon years ago when i was in my early s .","267174":"it can be to some people , but it comes down to an individualized basis and what people will and will not tolerate . it also depends on the degree of flirting involved , whether it s something harmless with no intention or something more serious with great intention .","267175":"bruh , rofl .","267176":"no , i couldn t care any less .","267177":"well , i wouldn t necessarily describe anything as hate because that s a very strong feeling that i only feel towards perhaps individuals . but people answer questions based on what they re comfortable talking about , and while it does show one side of who they are , it doesn t encompass them completely .","267178":"a culmination of all of my experiences , whether they were personal experiences or professional experiences , and what i ve learned through friendships and relationships .","267179":"i m nice and respectful to strangers until they give me a reason not to be anymore .","267180":"yes , i enjoy askfm . if i didn t , then i wouldn t be using it .","267181":"perhaps , depending upon the chemistry we have in other areas . although music is very important to me , so it would be difficult for me to even find someone who doesn t like something that i like music wise , haha .","267182":"i prefer television shows because it s easier for me to watch since i can stop after any episode and continue the next day . i like watching them alone .","267183":"i ve never owned an apple phone before .","267184":"i m not sure if i agree with a mandatory vaccine at the moment , but it wouldn t surprise me if the vaccine does become mandatory in the future . as for my opinion on people who refuse to take the vaccine , i think it s irresponsible .","267185":"no , not exactly , although i guess my views on what happens after death can be akin to reincarnation in a sense . basically , i believe when we die , our physical bodies perish but our souls or spirits or whatever you believe transfer mediums , as it s composed of energy and energy cannot be destroyed .","267186":"same thing , haha . i went to college , attended my classes and often wrote my papers between classes , and then went home or went to work .","267187":"at the moment , it s supernatural . however , other favorite shows of mine include criminal minds , ncis , how i met your mother , parks and recreation , game of thrones , house , ghost adventures , and bob s burgers .","267188":"unfortunately , alcohol use is extremely normalized in today s society , and a lot of people who ab se alcohol refuse to consider themselves to be alcoholics until something really terrible happens . meanwhile , other addictions such as to certain drugs are shunned , like you said , because there s more of a stigma attached to them , and those addicts are often isolated and dehumanized because they have an addiction .","267189":"was great for me professionally , but not so great on a personal level . i was given extra responsibilities at work and earned greater respect from higher management , which has been amazing . however , my mental health declined somewhat over the course of the year , and i started developing new symptoms that i had not experienced before .","267190":"my day is going well . i slept in this morning , which felt really nice . then i had some breakfast and coffee , scrolled through social media for a bit , then played video games for a few hours . it s been a day of relaxation , especially since it s been rainy and cloudy all day . right now , i m just listening to music and answering questions .","267191":"better health , more room for self expression , and continuing on my journey toward recovery .","267192":"absolutely . that s why i don t associate with people like that anymore .","267193":"i would improve their reporting blocking system .","267194":"aw , thank you","267195":"it doesn t make me feel any particular way , and it doesn t surprise me either because i already knew that fast food is served at a larger , unhealthier capacity in the united states compared to other countries .","267196":"i didn t really have any great experiences at school . i simply showed up , attended my classes , and went home .","267197":"chester bennington , even though he passed away almost four years ago .","267198":"who knows .","267199":"uh , no . rofl . that s extremely disrespectful to him and his relationship .","267200":"i ve had my jealous moments in the past , but i was able to let go of them rather easily when i started to not care about the person anymore .","267201":"yeah , although i don t believe in the conventional definition of a soul mate . i believe people can have multiple soul mates , meaning others with whom they share a close connection , and it doesn t always have to be on a romantic level .","267202":"it really depends on who that person is . there are some people i can cut out of my life with no hesitation whatsoever , while there are others i cannot let go at all .","267203":"interview with the vampire by anne rice . reading that book at such a formative age really helped shape my writing .","267204":"i don t believe they should be held to a higher standard of education on a matter , but considering celebrities do have a larger platform than the regular civilian , i think they should really consider their opinions and how it affects others before posting their views on social networks or during interviews .","267205":"i think it would be amusing to reveal who all of the anons are for hours .","267206":"i respect everyone until they give me a reason not to respect them anymore .","267207":"do some self thinking and discover why you feel jealousy in the first place perhaps it s because you may be insecure about yourself , or some other reason . once you figure out why you feel jealous of others or a particular person , it becomes a bit easier to handle that jealousy and explain rationally to yourself how to get over it .","267208":"was simultaneously fast slow , for some reason . certain months went by incredibly fast , while other months went slowly . and it feels like last march was so long ago , but also not long ago at all .","267209":"i really value compliments on my writing .","267210":"this music ambience video from skyrim . https www . youtube . com watch ? v xcmmmdjpeec t s","267211":"not as an adult , no .","267212":"people speaking over me while i m talking .","267213":"cheating , controlling behavior i . e . saying i can t go out with my friends or wear certain clothing , as examples , manipulation and other ab sive behaviors , and disrespect .","267214":"absolutely . communication is one of the key foundations to having a healthy relationship

like anything that s too hot .","267220":"nothing . when i m upset , then that usually leads to a depressive episode and nothing can make me laugh or cheer me up until the episode fades .","267221":"japanese food , such as sushi . i also like middle eastern food , particularly lamb rice platters with white sauce and hummus .","267222":"compassion , loyalty , maturity , and respect .","267223":"i spent saturday running errands and getting tested for covid , and today i m just relaxing as best as i can before i return to work tomorrow .","267224":"you can t exactly get rid of him because you re not the person dating him . however , if you have such a strong dislike towards your best friend s boyfriend , then you should sit down with your best friend and describe to her how he behaves and that you believe she deserves someone more mature and responsible .","267225":"i think it s disgusting , especially if they re treating those lower position workers as less than human or just a number . ideally , bosses in high management positions should respect and accommodate lower position workers because they often are the foundation to any company .","267226":"i haven t thought much about it at all . i m probably going to make some tomato soup and grilled cheese .","267227":"yes , haha . when i was dating my ex , there was one woman in particular who was set on ruining our relationship and even threatened me over social media , which was completely ridiculous .","267228":"not very often at all , unless it s for necessities like food , shampoo conditioner , body wash , toothpaste , etc etc . over the past week , i did drop like on random clothing for myself , but i was feeling manic so i didn t think anything of it at the time .","267229":"progress further in my mental health recovery and write creatively more often .","267230":"scrambled eggs on a toasted english muffin .","267231":"i took this last night to show off my new supernatural shirt .","267232":"i don t have any experience with this type of situation , so i m not really sure what a normal timeline for this would be . it depends on the seriousness of the relationship on both ends , and perhaps he s nervous . either way , you should try to talk to him about this directly if you haven t tried already .","267233":"sometimes i m in the mood for certain clothing , so when i wear clothing that resembles that aesthetic , it makes me feel more confident in myself .","267234":"death bed by powfu . https www . youtube . com watch ? v u aklngpyc","267235":"it was this morning , but not currently .","267236":"i don t really think it has any correlation , but regardless , if someone has had a traumatic or sad past , it can be difficult to get closure from that past and move forward .","267237":"mathematics , ugh . i absolutely hated it , but it also came easily to me .","267238":"the cruise i went on last february and going camping with my friends last october . both experiences were amazing .","267239":"cocaine . i tried it a very times when i was younger , and while i felt fantastic on it in the moment , the crash was absolutely terrible .","267240":"no , i m very much overweight .","267241":"i use twitter most days out of the week , and i do enjoy using twitter . if i didn t enjoy it , then i would simply delete my account .","267242":"i don t know how to ice skate , so no .","267243":"music always gives me goosebumps , haha . it happens on occasion , especially very emotional songs that i can relate to .","267244":"i didn t really want anything besides a dvd drive for my laptop and the lotr movies , and i did receive those for christmas . i m happy with the outcome .","267245":"i m sorry for your friend s losses . that s always so incredibly difficult to go through . as for advice , i would suggest that you simply be there for him when he needs it , and tell him upfront that you do care about him and his well being , and he can always come to you for support or if he just needs someone to listen . even if he doesn t do anything about it , the thought is still there .","267246":"probably not me , i seldom travel to begin with .","267247":"yeah , i met the members of linkin park back in . i met mike shinoda for a second time in .","267248":"working , as usual .","267249":"yeah , there s one shirt that i usually wear when i want to look nice for a certain event or going out it s a three quarter length sleeved black blouse with lace on the front . other than that , i just received a supernatural tee shirt in the mail yesterday and i m in love with it , haha .","267250":"i would probably tell a few close friends , but that would be all .","267251":"video games , music , true crime , mental health awareness , politics to a certain extent , the paranormal , television shows , and drinking .","267252":"my close friends who have always supported and encouraged me .","267253":"mental illness .","267254":"because my eating is already a bit disordered i seldom eat and usually skip meals entirely , and i feel if i went on a diet or lifestyle change , it would only make that worse .","267255":"myself , whether i like it or not .","267256":"no , i never have before . i don t really have an interest in being vegetarian or vegan at the moment .","267257":"depends on my mood , my taste in music varies . i normally listen to alternative rock , indie , emo rock , hip hop , some pop music , lo fi , instrumental soundtracks to games television shows movies , classical music , etc etc .","267258":"the best way would be to spend time together and explain your feelings reasoning in person . the worst way would be through a text message or just ghosting your partner completely .","267259":"mystic fire topaz .","267260":"approach the situation with rationality and understand that there s no possibility of a relationship between you two , and then try to focus your attention elsewhere .","267261":"not very far in advance , tbh . i m usually pretty impulsive and spontaneous .","267262":"pepperoni pizza . i don t like pizza with a lot of toppings .","267263":"you can simply walk up to her or message her ,

.","267265":"no , i ve never cheated before .","267266":"yes , i fully believe people have the capacity to change . however , it requires self actualization on their part and a willingness to change .","267267":"this has been happening to me far before covid , haha . but these days , i really only watch music compilations like instrumental soundtracks that don t have ads because the maker isn t interested in making profit off of their videos .","267268":"no , i m not the biggest fan of chocolate in general .","267269":"it depends on the individual . some people are ready for marriage early on , while others want to wait . and there are some people who aren t interested in marriage at all .","267270":"someone surprising me with coffee .","267271":"there aren t any quotes that i live by

personally it s finding clothes that fit my midsection , but the breasts don t help very much either . at the moment , i like them because i d rather my breasts stick out further than my stomach . but when my stomach is flat , i ll definitely want to chop em off .","267307":"lol . it isn t really much work , the shout outs count as questions to other people so that s easy enough . i answer a lot of
