   Wake up for Christmas
  ","
  Oh my apologies. I reread this. I read it the first time wrong. You said it correct.
  
  Considering I spent Christmas completely alone basically. I got up at I think 11:30 or 12. I have one person that lives here but they don't really speak to me much. My husband was at work until 6:30 at night. I had a visitor at 2 or 3 so I didn't spend it completely alone and then another visitor at 4:35. But if I would have woken up early I would have been alone probably for a full 8 hours.
  
  If my husband would have been here we probably would have woken up at 8.

  "
42924,"
   What does it cost you to get your hair styled?
  ","
  I've never really just went in and got my hair styled so I'm not sure.
  
  But the girl that cuts my hair I hook her up because she has family and a good friend of mine it has been cutting my hair for like 20 years.
  
  So I spend definitely more than normal but I do it out of  generosity.
  
  Plus sometimes she gives me really good deals too.
  
  Just styled.. Like say I want my hair just curled. Like 35 or 40 bucks?
  
  To be washed, cut and styled the way I like it. About 80 bucks. But again I give her more than what I am originally charged. Plus I bring food or flowers when I go. When I don't bring I give big tips for how well she does and just cause.. Like I said.. Because I know her well and that is just how I like to be. She is alot older and knows how to do old school scene hair. That's usually what I get. And sometimes a double cut.
  
  But if I get my hair washed, cut, dyed, extra care, straightened, and styled, eyebrows done. It's about around 150 to 180 dollars. 2 dyes 200 to 240 depending on what and how it's being done. Depends...
  
  But she only charges me 115- 125 for the 1 dye. And I tip with food or flowers. Haha. So.. Yeah. ? She even sometimes charges flat 100. Just depends. I like to give more so... but as I said she has cut my hair my whole life and I have been knowing her for a very very long time and she's good friends with me and I like to hook her up and help out. That's why it's probably a little bit more on my end. I don't mind though. I like to have healthy hair. Nice hair
  "

  No. I said that I haven't owned a pair for a very very long time. I almost can't even remember.

  ","
  Yeah. I try.
  "
42928,"
   Jealousy, aye I agree, but you won't let that get to you ?
  ","
  Nope.
  
  I even just had someone ask me.
  
  When I met him and like how long until we started dating or something. I don't remember exactly what they asked just now but like.. I don't answer those questions because see.. Those questions are not important. ? lol. Cause when I go to answer those questions then they start judging and that is jealously at it's finest.
  
  Like.. Why does it matter is my point? I do not know you?
  
  We are married. And have been married years. ?? I just said this? Read?
  
  Met Jason long before we got married many many times.
  
  We knew everything about one another and one another's families.
  
  Our relationship wasn't any different from any other relationship is my point?
  
  People look at long distance relationships as people falling inlove blindly. And then just meeting up without knowing or see or even speaking to them. Just only through text and believing little details about the person online.
  
  That is the complete unsafe way of doing it all.
  
  And I did not meet him online intending to date him. Considering I have been playing online gaming for over a decade, tops.
  
  Then gaming for 2 decades.
  
  They don't know me Tommy. So they are quick to judge.
  "
42929,"
   Yup ?
  ","
  Lol. I don't do that bro.
  "
42930,"
   I dunno how people can laugh at you tbh, you're happy together, who cares how you met, I dunno why people judge others on how they meet their partners ?
  ","
  It's jealousy whether they admit it or not. People want a perfect relationship. They seek a perfect relationship lies in their backyard. People close to them. Like near and distance. They think that just because somebody is at a distance that trust is questioned with every single human. Skepticism.
  
  When they don't know how those two people are together and how they are in general. People get angry because we went through all that stuff and are perfectly fine and happy together. No problems. Always stressful towards one another. There for each other. Caring. Patient.
  
  Couples that are near each other, that met so simple. Not all. But I usually see it and couples like that or people like that. They get jealous. They want to hate on people that are doing good. Because they are not doing good. Not even the slightest. They can't have even one of those characteristics I labeled.

  ","
  Yep. He's lovely. I never thought I'd meet my husband on a video game. Very unexpected the way it happened. But it all happened the way it did and we are happy. That's all that counts. It doesn't matter how we met. What matters is how we are doing. Everything worked out successfully. People laugh at us but they're right in their backyard and they're fighting. We were 400 miles from each other and for four and a half years we were separated and we were patient and did all good and we're here today.
  
  We did The Impossible.

  Just trying to live it as stressless as possible. A safe and happy as I can with my husband and pups.
  
  Unless you're talking about work. I work at an Associated grocery store. It's like a food market store. And I work in a little bit of each one of the department's. There is a meat department, there is a deli, there is a produce area, there's some plants, there's a dairy and frozen food area, there's an office area and there's a cashier area. Then there is stockers. I have worked very much in each one of those departments. Taking care of customers and selling things. Keeping them happy. I have been doing this for about 9 to 10 years.
  
  Things that I enjoy doing on the side are working on vehicles. Building guns and knives. Just for fun. Painting. Gaming. Socializing with people and going out and traveling and exploring.
  
  My most favorite thing to do is sing and entertain and make people laugh. Every now and then I bartend weddings and events for people if they need me to. I can be a photographer for them also if they need it.
  
  I also enjoy the subjects of geography and paranormal and weather. I have been researching the Paranormal for about around a decade. Helping people in answering questions. Dealing with different tools. Visiting different attractions.
  
  I love to cook. I'm Cajun French. From south Louisiana. Cooking is in my blood.
  
  I enjoy working out. I also have a YouTube channel where I post vlogs.
  
  There's a lot of more things I like to do. Hobbies and little jobs that I do on the side. I consider myself a pretty hardworking person. Determined and passionate about the things I do.
  
  I have a strong care for children, elderly folk, vets, special needs folk, people that are in need of help and animals.
  
  So yeah. This is what I do with mt life.

  Lots of weird paranormal things have happened.
  
  We've had tons people steal. Just a thought of them having a weapon possibly to hurt someone if they were to try to stop them is a crazy thought.
  
  One day we had someone jump someone and beat the crap out of them (it was people on one) and maybe stab them? Idk if that part was true. But that was in the parking lot. That's scary because I walk in that parking lot too and one day that could be me? Or a innocent child or just another person. It is very scary to think.

   What do you need to vent about? ?
  ","
  I'm sick and tired of living with this person in our house. Sadly, there's nothing we/I can do about it. We just have to sit back and wait. They are rude and ugly and have always been since day one to me. I have never done anything to this person, clearly since I said from day 1, obviously they have always wanted* to be rude/ugly to me.
  
  Jealousy maybe? They just don't like people and they are very rude to me because I am married into the family, so they pretty much treat me like I'm not family no matter what. Even tho I am? ? they literally treat me like everything and anything I say is impossible... They don't make me feel welcome. Make fun of everything and anything I do. Judge me for anything and everything I do. I don't know if this person is ill or something. ? But all I know is it is very discouraging to have someone do that to you every single day of your everliving life.
  
  I think honestly it is jealousy because I am happily married to their fam & maybe they are sad that they're seeing them grow up maybe?
  
  All I know is I have never done anything to this person for them to be the way that they are to me.
  
  Everything and anything that I have ever told them is it the truth about me, where I'm from, how I was raised, and how I made myself the person I am today. I guess they think anything that happens in their world, & if they hear anything different outside of their world and how it works, they think it's a lie? Idk  Some people are so used to their life and how everything works, they think everything else successful is impossible. I don't know if that makes any sense but at the end of the day I feel that this person is jealous in a way and I'm about tired of the games. I just want to live my life. It's a frustrating situation.
  
  This is why I am on here and try to be there for people. Because some people don't have anyone. I want people to look at the brighter side of things. I do. I don't mention this a lot. This whole big giant answer. I keep to myself on it.

  You ask and answer questions.
  
  Do shoutouts. Like you just did. It sends it to random people though, so be aware of what you say because some of the people responding can be trolls and spam and asholess.
  
  You can send shoutouts and questions anonymously or showing. There is a little bar at the bottom of the question thing where you can swtich it. Every time you go into that little hub you have to press it again if you want to be seen.
  
  You can reward people on their answers with fire/coins and like their answers.
  
  There is a leaderboard for every country and the coins / fire go towards them ranking in their country.
  
  You can follow people and they can follow you.
  
  You can't see who follows you.
  
  You can answer questions with photos and GIFs.
  
  You cannot ask questions with photos and GIFs.

  You can add a cover photo but the thing is is they blur it out. It's some kind of theme/thing that they do I don't understand that but they blur it out so I would just focus on colors if you put a cover photo. Cuz you literally can't see it.
  
  Obviously you can have a bayou and a profile picture. The appropriate about it because they do have a reporting system on here. Ask team will watch your answers. So watch out for that too. You can also add hashtags of subjects that you're interested in in your bio below.

   I want a really hot girl to tell me if I'm ugly or not. Any volunteers? I'll give you my snapchat ?
  ","
  This is strange..
  
  You shouldn't need somebody to tell you you are hot.
  
  You should just have confidence in yourself that you are. That's the most attractive thing a person can do in my opinion. Not to say that they are NOT good looking, but you say that they are. Not to bloat about it but to have some sort of its self-esteem / confidence in yourself... not blow your insecurities also.
  
  It's okay to have some insecurities and to show some but to always 100% show your insecurities can be very unattractive and annoying...
  
  And alot of people who could agree with me on this and also disagree.. You wouldn't want your girl to say she's fat every single day would you? No. Especially if she isn't?! That would be annoying as heck... Like you lit look perfectly fine? But like.. it's good to be like I might be a little overweight and work towards losing it and getting more healthier. But not everyday standing in front of a mirror and you ARE fit and nice looking and still say that you are fat?! ? There are some people that can't even work out. They have health issues and have to stay the way that they are. Big or skinny. People should be appreciative of what they are given. And I'm not saying you aren't. No. But you don't need someone to tell you that you are ""hot."" We are all beautiful individuals. And again don't need somebody to assure you that you are or change you if you're not this expectation of that one person. You're not going to please everyone. It's literally impossible. For we are all different and like different.

   Do you agree that pet-shops should not sell animals?
  ","
  Depends. Sometimes keeping them in a confined space, considering I feel, which is clear, that they are a a bit more than what the world probably is supposed to naturally have. Overpopulated. It's probably the best for the world. If only people wouldn't over breed certain..
  
  But all of those over bred dogs and cats... then we would probably have an issue because they would be more non-domestic and more aggressive towards people. Because if you ever seen stray dogs and cats are usually not very nice towards people. A lot of them aren't. Some of them are from a household and that have ran away and are slightly domestic. But.. There would be more of them is what I'm saying. I feel like the purpose of an animal shelter and these animal buildings is to keep them domestic and from overpopulating out in the wild. I don't always just look at the fact that they're in a confined space and possibly not treated correctly. Sadly we have people that work in that field that are like that. We have bad apples in every field. But honestly if they weren't so over populated then known. I would rather than just be out of wild. Some of these animals are made for Homes. At one point they weren't. It's kind of a big Theory / argument that I don't really like to touch the surface of very much because people like to argue a lot about it. Look at people as their opinion is an awful thing towards them. I don't try to think more or less evil towards anything at all. I tried to look at the positives and everything. The good. What can we do to get better? Type thing...

  They used to serve it to us back in school and it was the best. Perfect and the best thing that they ever served there.
  
  Occasionally switch it up from like ham and bacon. But never together. Only individual. But this was a very delicious and creamy Pizza. There wasn't much to it but for some odd reason it was perfect. And we always wanted more.

   What was the last show you binge watched? (That you actually watched, not just for background noise)
  ","
  It's the show on Netflix about a tunnel that goes very deep into the ground and I mean very deep into the ground. They have been working on the hole for over 200 years. At the bottom of this really dark water filled tunnel is another tunnel does extremely darker and very small, at the bottom of this one is a bunker that has said to have different treasures and artifacts lying beneath it that are worth trillions and we'll uncover some of the greatest history of all time. All of these tunnels are filled with water as I said. At the bottom also human remains from people trying to get to it..  Like people that passed working in that hole... And a lot of rock and debris and stuff. Many people have died trying to get to the bottom of this. People have spent millions and millions and millions of dollars trying to get to the bottom of this hole. To get to the bottom of this whole they have to remove certain beams (thousands of pounds a piece, weighing and extremely long pieces) that are rusted and that are dangerous. And a ton of debris. They're trying to make it safer for divers to get to the bottom of the hole to see this Cavern below that has Treasures awaiting. The risk is high. The reward is very great and humongous. And the show is exciting and very adventurous like. Lots of History filled. This is the kind of stuff that I enjoy watching.

  Well, she was very misguided or easily influenced l really.. Very gullible I guess. I was friends with her for a very long time. Over a decade nearly. People seriously need to realize the person that you're talking to when they warn you about something. If I've known you for 10 years I am not going to lie to you about how someone is. When I get a bad Vibe I get a bad vibe. And I got a bad Vibe about those people. In the end I was correct. I'm not going to hang out with people that have do drugs and do bad things. More than likely when you hang out with people that do drugs and do bad things then you end up doing drugs and doing those bad things. Influence. Being in a bad environment. Unsafe environment.

  "

   Have you ever made a baby cry whether it be or not on purpose? ? (If yes, why?)
  ","
  Not on purpose. A lot of the times when a baby cries it may not even be really you. It just might be them upset about something like being hungry or tired or going to be changed.
  
  They can be hurting with their teeth. Bored and wanting attention. Crying from being uncomfortable. May not be feeling well. One never knows considering they don't speak because they're so young.
  
  Other times it could be your fault but not meaning to be. You may not be holding the baby correctly the way they want to be at the moment. Try changing them. You could be late on her changing. They use the restroom randomly. You can change them in 5 minutes later they use the restroom again. They could go hours without using the restroom. You have to continuously check them.
  
  Keep up-to-date with their shots and doctor visits. They could not feel well.
  
  When's the last time you fed them? What did you feed them? They may not have had enough or they could be ready to eat again.
  
  So much.

I like hearing how other people celebrate stuff :) it's interesting seeing the little differences
  ","
  Every Christmas Eve we open a present under the tree. One usually from my mom. One that she's really excited about us opening and she can't wait so we open it for her and it makes her very happy. (May I remind you, I have three sisters so there was four of us. So four happy faces, presents from Mama are the best.) The reason why we were always so excited about opening that present is because it's mostly the present that best describes us from her so it's very special. Very sweet. Christmas is not always about getting and giving but when it does come to that and this is what it means to us. It's very special to my family. In this way.
  
  Another good thing that we do is every Christmas morning when we used to wake up my grandfather would be waiting on the porch petting the dog (The dog at the time that we have is a very good dog. Her name is Angel, Golden Retriever and was my mama and grandfathers baby. She loved him very much. My family and my grandfather) and we would go out and visit him for a few minutes before opening the Christmas presents in the living room from Santa. He would watch us open our presents.
  
  We would wake up around 6 or 7 in the morning and open presents. Check out what Santa had brought us, check out the stockings. Open the presents and then we would all go lay down for a little bit. We would either have donuts or breakfast or beignets in the morning. Then we would play with our stuff for a little while and then go to my grandmother's around 10:00/10:30 in the morning and do Christmas with the entire family together.
  
  The family would get together and socialize. The younger ones would play outside or with toys in the living room at my grandmother's. Have fun and catching up with each other. Open the presents from one another. And then go house to house and visit people.
  
  Sometimes we may go out at the end of the day it just depends.
  
  Go and look at houses with the Christmas lights out. That is a tradition.

   Why do people date online nowadays?
  ","
  I guess they run out of options where they live.
  
  Sometimes people don't want to date people in their area because it seems that everybody's dating one another and it's odd.
  
  But like people that just randomly hook up with people without even getting to know them is not good I feel.
  
  I have seen it happen to different people and it usually never works out. It takes time and patience. You have to get to know a person and their family, their background, the environment that they live in and how they are before just meeting up with them.
  
  A relationship is something very special. You're supposed to make it very special. To help it last and stuff.
  
  And so much more.
  
  I say, if you did online be extremely careful. You shouldn't be online if you're not going to try to take the certain types of precautions.
  
  Just meeting up with random people can also get you sick, give you STDs, and can be deadly in the end. Can meet up with someone that's completely insane.

   if you were arrested with zero explanation, what would your friends and family think you did?
  ","
  Probably for going the heck off on someone for doing some stupid sh- but it would have to be some serious stuff..
  
  They're probably call the police because they're scared of me. Were they feel in danger. They would have to call someone to call me now.
  
  I usually try to be well respectful and chill about things. Even when people are being the most disrespectful.
  
  But like putting their hands on me inappropriately (especially if I told him no or I pull away), being rudely racist and making it obvious to the point of trying to embarrass, inappropriately touching a child and I see, or trying to take a child in front of me, someone beating on someone for no reason, bullying... it just depends. But these are serious situations in which depending on what would be going on I would react and include myself in. I would probably go crazy on them... I'm a pretty protective type person. I believe in being fair. I believe in if someone's not hurting anyone then everything's cool. Even if they're trying to hurt them mentally I will stick up for them but I'm not going to physically do anything besides maybe remove the person from the environment. But if someone physically puts their hands on me or child or some random person especially an elderly person or someone that doesn't know any better I will include myself in the situation. Or at least if I get put into it. But if I see something happening honestly I'm going to react.

   If you were to build your dream house and you had an unlimited budget, how'd you make it? ? Go crazy with the descriptions if you feel like it!! Like, what kind of style it would be, where it would be placed, what kind of dimensions it would have, what things you would like to have inside etc. ??
  ","
  When you walk in there's a really nice front entrance on the outside and it goes into the inside of the house and it's very big when you first walk in. Like an open floor plan. Pillars and a huge sunroof type thing like the roof goes very high up to a nice window so the Sun comes in. Good for saving money on lights. But as you walk in right on the right is a small hallway and a room call the mud room where you can put your coat skis shoes and dirty clothes. That will be the laundry room. But it does not mess of the beautiful entrance into the house. As you walk into the house on the right is living room and on the left is the kitchen. Both rooms kind of flow into one another but there is an archway that separates them. But that first room in the front is like a big entry room. Part of the living room that flows into the rest. The kitchen is absolutely huge. Tons of cabinets face a huge island. A bar area to stoves a dishwasher two fridges/ freezers. And the kitchen goes on to a hallway which has a office, a storage room and the dining room. Also little bathroom.
  
  Then as you go to the living room there's a long hallway with pictures all along the hallway and an upstairs at the end of the hallway. Along the hallway there are two rooms and then the hallway turns to a right which has one other room with a bathroom attached. At the end of the first hallway on the left there is a outside door. Like the backyard door. In the regular hallway there is a bathroom also for the two rooms that will share. Then you go upstairs and there is a loft area which is on the right and then on the left is a giant master bedroom with a huge master bath. There is a giant closet. The Loft area is a gaming area / storage area. Every hallway contains at least two closets.
  
  Then as you go out to the backyard there is a giant Greenhouse. There is a barn. There is a station area where you can work out. There is a carpentry area. 8 car garage huge front yard pain included. 50 acres of land. & more.

Their friend....) with a long time ago I went in their friend's house and all of the couches  had no cushions on them, the bed was missing a box spring there was smoking something so thick that I couldn't see them feet from me. There was stains on everything. There was a hole in the roof somehow. Found out that they had stolen a cat from someone I knew. It smelled horrible and everything seems like if I touched it I would be dirty. They had pet tarantulas. Which there's nothing wrong with that but it just didn't go with the environment. I felt terrified and ended up leaving few minutes later. They were all sitting sideways on the furniture playing video games looking half dead. One of them even explain to me their experience on a type of drug I've never heard of. Yeah extremely explicit, disturbing and dangerous. I don't think I hung out with that friend very much after that.

   Can't sleep cus I have a serious cough ? When you have a cough, what do you do to ease it? Any tip is appreciated haha...
  ","
  Kind of depends on what kind of cough it is. Usually my coughs are caused from my broncular issues. Bronchitis. I usually have to sit up a little bit when sleeping. Basically put about five pillows behind you and make sure you're sitting upright a little bit. You maybe having mucus in your lungs prob. It sounds like it hut i
  
  Idk.. I am not there. I could probably tell if I was there.  But if you have mucus in your lungs.. it's irritating them and causing you to cough a lot. When you're sitting up the mucus isn't just sitting there. When you set up a may take about 10 minutes for you to calm down. Usually you have to go to the doctor and get steroids or something for it. They usually prescribe you a type of mucus DM if you're able to take it and give you breathing treatments. ( even after all of that you usually have a bronchial cough for almost a month before it goes away...) That's about all they do for bronchitis. At least for me.
  
  You can get you some tea and raw honey and lemon. I'm not sure how old you are but some people use wild turkey or some type of whiskey and put it in there a little bit helps numb your throat if your throat is hurting. If your throat is not hurting then it's probably a bronchial thing.  then what you would have to do is probably what I said above before the tea and lemon part. I am not a doctor I am just telling you based off of experience. I would more than likely go to a doctor and ask them first. But if you are having sinus problems and your throat hurts and that's why you're coughing I use Ricola cough drops that help numb your throat too. Vitamin C and D. Maybe some mints. Chloraseptic spray. DM medicine. Sinus medicine. That's about all the remedies I can think of at the moment. I hope that I helped. Do you remember both paragraphs or two different types of coughs. Those are ways to feel better with both. Just depends on what you have. Taking showers and keeping your hygiene up is another way to getting better. Change clothes alot.

I believe in treating everybody equally. I don't take kindly to bullying or racial slurs. I don't see skin color. I talk and help everybody out the same. I don't see views.

  Eh.. depends. Because People usually roast Cajun folk in the comments. ? at the same time I don't really care but, we do things very strange and different when cooking. Down to trying raw meat when it's seasoned. Down to smelling the food and trying food when it's cooked and not cooked. Punching and throwing ingredients around based off of thought and gut feeling. Sometimes just knowing how much you're supposed to put. Though that's how life is and everybody is a critic but... I already have a YouTube channel where I put all kinds of things on it. Mostly the vloggs of my life. BellaMarieStarSwan is my channel.

  No. And if I did I would literally beat the sh- outta them. Plus if my husband would have been there, I would feel really bad for that person that day.
  
  My husband is a huge man and is not very happy when people touch his woman, especially inappropriately and when I don't want them to. Everybody should have respect and privacy. Have your own bubble that people should stay out of. Especially people that they don't know. But.. he's a big tall man covered in tattoos. Works to protect and knows many different types of martial arts. Also knows his rights. And so do I. Now don't get me wrong. He is a very nice and sweet individual and he's very respectful of both men and women. But when you make him mad and break that respect. Bad things happen and justice comes in.)
  
  And honestly random strangers would probably beat the crap out of them. You'd be surprised of how awesome people are in the south.

Sometimes if we have kids over they'll try to play with them. The little claws or pinch them and stuff. And some of the kids are just terrified of them. And some of them are just having a blast playing with them. And at the end of the day when you cook them they're delicious. You see the smiles on people's faces.

  You are not the problem. People do not see different a lot. Some people are not raised to where they mind those who cannot help the way that they were born; the way that they are. Just look at it as that. People have a lot of insecurities. When I get the opportunity to pick on whoever they can they do it. It's a way of making them feel better for some reason. That's where malicious people come from. Sometimes they don't even realize they're doing it. They're so full of themselves that they don't even care to listen to anyone. It's almost like they can't help it themselves and they have a problem of their own. Maybe look at it like that.

   What are some Christmas traditions you have? Do you like these traditions? What traditions would you like to have?
  ","
  Usually will sit here and decorate the entire house the day after Thanksgiving. If we feel really festive we will decorate a little bit before Thanksgiving. Usually will put lights up outside and we'll decorate the entire house with Christmas type stuff. Will put up the Christmas tree wait a few days and decorate it. We'll put up the stockings and the reef on the door. Christmas mats and tablecloth and the little place masks that you put at each seat for your food to go on. Will take out the Christmas hand towels. There's little ceramics that we put around the house on different furniture. There's a few pictures sometimes we'll put up on the walls. We might put the blow up things outside with the lights. Will put the nativity scene up somewhere in our house or outside. We will go every now and then and go Christmas shopping or window shopping to see what they want. Take a few days to wrap presents and put them under the tree. By candy canes and put them on the tree. Every day counting down to Christmas we eat a candy cane off the tree. We do stocking stuffers and candy and each stocking. Put a favorite candy of each person in their stocking. At least three or four stocking stuffers. Usually get everybody a few presents. Everybody gets to open one present on Christmas Eve. We wake up around 7, 8 or 9 in the morning and open Christmas presents and then go to my grandparents and open more with the entire family and enjoy dinner and talk to everybody. Since I live in Mississippi now we don't really do that. Will either go a few days before Christmas or after Christmas and do that. Also since my grandparents have passed now we just go to my mom's and then after we go to different family members houses. We still cook for Christmas Eve and Christmas. This is just a few Traditions that we do. We usually do at least 90% of these every year. I absolutely love Christmas. It's my most favorite time of the year. It's so peaceful. Plus I love the cold and the winter.

  Caught people from falling. Watching the road when someone wasn't and warning them that something is about to happen and they maneuvered a way to avoid. If I wouldn't have told them way more than likely would have crashed.
  
  Taking care of as many animals.

  It definitely depends. Sometimes I just like going with the flow and then other times I do like to plan things out.
  "
43805,"
   Is it bad to not have friends except your family members?
  ","
  Eh.. Can be. Depends... it depends on if your family members are doing something to upset your friend(s). At the end of the day it really shouldn't matter if they accept your family, they really should just accept you. Of course if they meet your family they need to remember to be respectful regardless. Especially to adults. It doesn't matter if they accept them or not. But if the family members are being downright ugly to your friends or maybe your friends see some sort of mental or physical abuse being done from your family towards you and they feel that you are unsafe. Then I could see why they might not want to accept them... it definitely depends. If they feel concerned that I need to go to a higher up or some type of authorities if they feel that you are unsafe. But at the same time they need to take this situation seriously cuz this is life and that is your family. They need to have evidence and be very serious about their approach to upper higher authority. AKA reporting.
  
  But if the people (your friend's) are just being disobedient to certain rules and regulations that you're family members have, then that is the part where it depends because that definitely does not matter as into the person that is your friend. They should accept your family members as so with their rules and regulations. Especially towards you in safety terms. I hope that you understand my answer. This also can be good advice towards dating. If you are dating someone and they don't accept your family and by the rules and regulations then there is something wrong. But at the same time that everyone gets along and it could literally be over nothing. Sometimes people just don't like certain people. And also sometimes parents get jealous when they see their baby growing up. It's hard for them to catch reality that they are growing up. Again I hope that you understand my answer.

The only time I ever say anything is if it's something pretty dangerous or like I'm pretty much saying already it can hurt someone. Like that's the only time I ever taken action when I'm there. Other times I tried to just defuse a situation, return whatever item or just not to buy that I'm getting there and just leave.

  Good ideas for stocking stuffers or like cards and not just like a deck of cards would like some really cool that's the cars. Little babies roll on perfumes and sprays. Bath bombs and the little masks. Big candy bars. Socks. Nail polish. Different types of makeups that are usually slim or small. The long Slim Jims. Candy canes, especially the big ones that are plastic and have the candy and them such as Hershey Kisses or little baby Kit Kats or something. The little toys that are on the Walmart dollar or $5 aisle. Like brain teasers and stuff. Mini puzzle. Mini stuffed animals sticking out of the top. I love the 20 question game and it's actually a really small item and you can put that in a stocking. Tamagotchis. Flashlight. Nail file. And more. (mini bottles of alcohol)

  First disappointment... Again I keep saying I don't remember the first one. I remember asking for Tinker Toys a few Christmas is in a row but we weren't able to find any. Not really a disappointment but more or less just sad. Not really that big of a deal. It's a toy.

   What is true beauty for you?
  ","
  Just being yourself is beautiful.... 100% for both man and woman...
  
  Following just the everyday normal needs is good.. Like keeping up with hygiene... As in... like taking care of just the regular needed things. Like showering, washing of the face brushing your teeth, brushing your hair, first clean clothes on everyday. Making sure you have your hair trimmed at the according time year round. Going to the doctor and making sure that you're healthy. You take care of yourself. Try not to bite your nails. (I myself am working on) No drugs or nothing. Just natural. Not too much makeup. It's okay to wear base/foundation every now or maybe to put some eyeliner on to bring out more features... or little eyeshadow or something... But some people just put a whole clown face on and looking completely like a different person?... No need for that... Be yourself. Be comfortable with you.
  
  Personality and attitude play a big role in a beautiful person. If you have a crappy attitude and people are not going to want to be around you much less want to be interested in you.. Yeah yeah.. You maybe ""hot"" ""look good"" but nobody is gonna wanna settle down with a cockyAshhole, no...
  
  Learn to have a sense of humor. Don't be so focused on losing weight all the time and calling yourself ugly.... Fat... Stupid... Too many insecurities can be an unattractive thing.  Don't have so much NEGATIVELY! Or too much negativity at least... Then.. have some sort of confidence in yourself. Every man likes a type of woman. You don't have to be a skinny stick for every guy or girl... You don't need to be a big for everyone... You just need to focus on you and be yourself. That's all that matters and THAT is what true beauty is I think.

  Learning how to ride my bike. I kept falling so my mom would make me ride in the grass so I could learn and not fall and hurt myself. I think that's what you told me to do the first time.

  There are so many that we do with the family and with ourselves. Usually the day after Thanksgiving, we put the Christmas tree up. That's always almost. Every now and then we get a real tree. We put up homemade and bought ornaments. Everybody puts their own ornaments up. Listen to Christmas music while we're decorating the Christmas tree. We usually put up Christmas lights outside and hang up the stockings in a certain order on the walls. We take a few days to go Christmas shopping together. A few days before Christmas shopping to figure out ideas of things that people want. We'll wrap or put them in bags under the tree. On Christmas Eve everybody gets to open one present. Then wake up Christmas Day and open all presidents and then we used to go over to my grandparents house but since they both passed the tradition is kind of lost. We just lost my grandmother. But we used to go over to her house and open presents with all the family and usually cook. Spoil. Are so many more traditions then what I have said already.

   What is the latest information regarding a possible breakthrough to control or cure Alzheimers Disease?
  ","
  Though there is no exact positive cure to Alzheimer's disease. Scientist overtime in this year of 2019 has been thoroughly practicing different types of things to try to ease Alzheimer's disease or two maybe stretch it longer or maybe even cure it. Through the studying and practicing, scientist tried to put short peptides, or strings of amino acids, that when injected into mice with Alzheimer's disease daily for five weeks, significantly improved the mice's memory. The treatment also reduced some of the harmful physical changes in the brain that are associated with the disease.
  
  They are totally trying to take control of Alzheimer's disease. No, it is not just in elderly folks, it is also common and young folks. Though it does affect more of people 65 years or older, it can affect others too. Alzheimer's disease can be a genetic thing, so keep an eye out if you have it in your family. Take certain vitamins to try to help ease it. Maybe try to figure out what triggers it. And there are other things that you can do for Alzheimer's disease. But as of now there is no cure, but just controls of the disease.

  As in a color that resembles me. That I compared to... I feel red white and blue. Those are colors of my country and I also love red just for multiple reasons. It's just a pretty color to me. I love red roses and both of my grandparents were buried in fire truck red coffins. They were absolutely beautiful. So fire truck red is my favorite color of all time. I love white because it resembles the cold to me and light for some reason. Snow. Ice. I also like light blue and blue because it also resembles snow and cold. My username is ice frozen vocals for a reason. But I just love those colors together anyway. They're on our American flag and are quite beautiful to me.

I really wish people would see the laws and understand that they can protect themselves in the way that they are allowed to. I wish people would mind their own business and if people want to do things a certain way let them. As long as you're not hurting anyone and not breaking any laws I don't see the problem. Wish people would see there amendments more clear and finally 100% respect any type of law enforcement and soldier that fights for our country and keeps us safe. Firefighters and more.

Though I'm away from my family is not impossible to communicate with them and see them. I may have to wait for the right time to but it is not impossible as I said. And as you said. You can do it. If you ever feel lonely just call them. Tell them how much you love them. Because we're not promised tomorrow. None of us are. You can do anything if I can. I believe in you! You can do it!

Hahahah. We're together and married and happy. No complications. The long-distance was really hard. Considering we were in a long distance relationship for about four and a half years. Just having constant communication. Trust. Loyalty. We got to know one another's family is completely. We video chat all the time. Our families liked each other.

  Texas has witness more natural disasters than any other state in the United States of America. Considering how big the state is I could see why because it's so big that it stretches over multiple different types of climates. It flies it get snow every year in the northern part of Texas. It gets hurricanes. They get tornadoes. I think it's really really dry some points the year. They can experience earthquakes. Wildfires... Yeah...  Everything...
  
  California is the next on the list. Sometimes it doesn't rain at all and they get really dry weather and wildfires go insane there. They get a ton of earthquakes. They every now and then experience floods just like any part of the USA. Tornadoes are not as from there but they can be. But honestly just the wildfires in the dryness is the worst part about living in California and the the earthquakes. The wildfires can stretch over hundreds of thousands of miles and almost seemed never-ending. Have killed many people and have ruined homes and. families. The earthquakes same thing.
  
  Oklahoma is next.
  
  With tons of wildfires floods winter storms and really bad tornado Seasons. This place is literally a widespread of tons of natural disasters. Within a year could have hundreds of tornadoes. Oklahoma as I said wildfires they gave very very dry at some times of the year.
  
  Alabama. Which experiences hundreds of tornadoes a year and gets really bad hurricanes and tornadoes.
  
  Same with Louisiana and Mississippi.
  
  Florida. Which experiences some of the worst  hurricanes and floods also.

  Sorry I took so long to answer this question. The reason why it took so long is because I love questions like this. I love when people ask about the things that we collect because me and my husband collect a lot of different things.
  
  We collect lighters, really cool and different looking knives, different types of decks of cards. We even have one deck that is waterproof and that's probably my favorite so far. A jumbo deck of cards.
  
  I collect bracelets and temporary tattoos.
  
  We collect different types of colognes and stuff. I love perfume and colognes.
  
  We collect hats we probably have over a hundred and fifty hats.
  
  We collect magnets. We like to travel a lot so every state that we go to we get a few magnets including one magnet that is the shape of the state so we can make the entire United States of America out of magnets.
  
  I like to collect dream catchers tho, I don't have too many of them, I think I own five including my tattoo on my arm.

   ⚜ Hi! How has your day been? In a few sentences can you please sum up and share what have you learnt or discovered about yourself this 2019? Ta?
  ","
  Hello. I'm doing all right today. Thanks for asking. I hope that you're doing all right?
  
  And this year... 2019 has been really tough... I lost a lot of people this year. Living in Mississippi we're having less and less people in our lives. It's just getting down to just me and my husband. It's a little sad being lonely but I can do it. But I have discovered from myself that I can be alone. I can do it. And you can do it too. You don't always need somebody there. Though it is nice to have someone there to talk to and to be around you, but you can be by yourself. You can do it.
  
  I'm also trying to stop biting my nails in the new year.
  
  I'm also trying to get lots of bills paid off.
  
  Work on fixing the house up and the yard.

   What do you consider traumatic in your life while others see it differently?
  ","
  The time when I was learning how to drive was extremely traumatic and now it is affected me in my life. I had a lot of close calls. And it was mostly from other people not paying attention and hitting me. Shortly after that I had a couple other incidences that were close calls. One where we were on a bridge and someone decided to cut us off it was a very close call... and knock us off the bridge which it was about a 15 or 20 foot drop maybe more just because they were in a hurry and not watching.
  
  Including one with a Mustang going across the median and almost hitting us head-on going like 80 or 90 miles an hour.
  
  Another one with an 18-wheeler turning in front of us when it was not their turn to go and we were literally maybe 50? feet in front of them. Luckily we had good drinks. My mom was driving and my husband and me were in the car. We almost ran into them going 50 or 60 miles an hour.

  When people don't respect hunting. The animals that they're hunting. I have been seeing so many videos regulating through Facebook of these two boys torturing an animal that they halfway killed. When you go to hunt, you were going to collect food. It's not a anger thing... let your anger out type laughing manner. No. When you go hunting you are looking for food to eat. You hunt and thank the Lord for the food that he provided for you and you go home and you eat every inch of that and still thank him before you eat.

  The things my grandmother and my grandfather used to tell me growing up. My grandmother used to feed the poor. She passed away recently... Sadly.. She did that for most of her life. And even people that were ugly to her for no reason that she didn't even know, they were strangers, she would still feed them regardless. That was a wise thing taught to me. She said she didn't mind them. She just did her job and moved on. She said everybody will get an answer one know from somebody. I've cared about was feeding people. Helping people out and make sure they were good.

   Seems like you had some very beautiful experiences already. ? — Wow, amazing that your husband and you could deal with a long distance relationship for five years. What was that like? How did you meet?
  ","
  (I messaged ya on there btw.)
  
  It was about 4 and a half years of distance. But yeah it was hard dealing with the distance. There's always going to be obstacles. You just always have to be talking back and forth, constant communication is important in any relationship, but especially for a long distance relationship. We would always be video chatting and calling one another and playing video games with each other.
  
  And yes, yes we've had a lot of good experiences on the road in Louisiana and Mississippi. We met 6 years ago on Xbox 360 on GTA V randomly and unexpectedly. We played games for a while and right at the beginning we hit it off. We're really good friends and play games for a while and really started to like one another. About six or seven months dating we finally ended up meeting one another. We knew everything about each other's families both of our families liked each other. When we met it felt like any other day. It was awesome! Finally meeting.
  
  He's my best friend. Always has been.
  
  We have been married a little over a year. Been living here in Mississippi for about a year and a half. We will be celebrating our 6-year anniversary being together April 2nd.
  
  And yes it was really hard being in a long-distance relationship. At one point we were away from each other for 13 and a half months I think. That was reeeally hard going through. I always tell people nothings impossible if ya just try and set ya mind to it. Patience is definitely one that you have to have with a long distance relationship. It's never going to be easy. It may take two years 3 years 4 years or even five years until you get to be together or longer. You just have to be patient. Trust is another one. Loyalty. If I could go back and meet him all over again I would. He's always had me at hello.

   Do you like to travel?
  ","
  I do. Me and my husband travel down to south Louisiana about 4 to 6 times a year to see my family and friends. That's where I am from originally. But other than that me and him want to travel all over the United States of America. He can't really fly much and he doesn't like boats so if I was to visit anywhere outside of the USA I would have to visit alone or with a friend or family member. I hope to visit many places outside of America. But I do love to travel very much. My favorite way to travel is my car. I love her trips. I love visiting different gas stations and seeing some of the things that they sell. I like seeing different pawn shops and antique shops on the way. The Landscaping is beautiful. This sky's are awesome. The weather makes it interesting. We also bring my dogs occasionally. So they make the trip really fun and exciting. They have fun also. We like to stop a different rest stops and let them walk around and play with them. I want to one day travel from North Carolina all the way to California. That is a straight shot completely across USA. I would like to visit Alaska and Canada one day. I would like to visit the UK. I would also like to visit Australia and many different places within Australia. I wish to visit Japan, India, Malaysia, and so much more. Pakistan. Bangladesh. Brazil. Argentina.
  
  I want to go to Antarctica one day. But I really do love to travel.
  
  Me and my husband were in a long distance relationship for about five years so we constantly had to travel back and forth from where he lived and where I lived to see each other. So distance and traveling has always been a part of my life. We always did Vlogs on the way back and forth. Throughout the whole long distance relationship we took videos. Alot of them are on my channel too. ?❤

  ","
  I just watch and hear them. It's not more or less like what they say to me as more of those like why do you have to say that to someone else. I usually don't pay attention to what they say to me I usually just ignore them... It's just like other people and how they react to it naturally... It's a little upsetting dot-dot-dot when they do get upset because in the end It's so uncalled for. To have to be so rude and ugly. There's a time and place for things. Sometimes it's better to just not say anything. That's what keeps me thinking. Why do you have to say that to them. Is it really worth it?

   I see you have an interest in the paranormal. What are your thoughts on a Ouija Board? Have they ever worked for you?
  ","
  I have been studying the paranormal for over 12 years now.
  
  It's funny how you mention Ouija boards because I have been on this topic for a few years now. Learning them and about them. I try to dis-promote using them because 80% to 90% of hauntings are caused by them.. they cause nothing but negative energy and ruin people's lives. Even in the correct way of using them you're not sure who you're talkin to truthfully... If you were talking to something negative and unhuman it can follow you and caused a lot of grief in your life... it's very hard to get it away from you once it clings to you. I don't promote using them because they are no joke. They are hard to use also. Alot of those negative energies make people go insane and do things that they're not even meaning to do and they turn into really dangerous people. Black out. These are things that I have uncovered while studying the board and the people sho have used it before. The cases I have seen are very intense. Sad. Very scary. Things you'd never believe that could happen.
  
  One of my user names I go by is Bella Ouija. Because I want people to talk to me about the boards so I can tell them these things. Because they are all real, the things I say. I have seen it. Alot of people are skeptical to it all and that's fine. I just ask for them to respect me and I'll respect them. Their thoughts and opinions on it all. This is what I have unravelled from it all in my research.

   I decided to do video replies on some questions that I get on here, because I think it‘s more personal and entertaining. What do you think about this? Here’s my first video reply:

  I liked it a lot. I like your videos and commented under them and subscribed to you.
  
  Best of luck to you.
  
  I think this is a very good idea and is very engaging and entertaining.
  
  And the scary thing is only 30 seconds you can reply on here. I really think they should fix it to about 2 minutes but that would take a long time to upload them probably. I can't even upload a 30-second one fast enough. But for the people that can I feel like this would be a good change. Allow them to upload longer videos for replies.
  
  But as I said before very good idea.

  That's how those kinda girls are. The one's that be jumping in and outta relationships all the time are the one's that are more than likely to do the same to you and that's what she did.

Make it y'alls own. That's what being a couple is all about.
  
  You don't want her to know EVERYTHING or a girl that acts cocky like... Like I do it better and know better/more... That kind've attitude is so annoying...
  
  Then if she's done it with so many people... In my mind.. I feel like that's kinda dirty... Like nasty... Like she's had that many dudes touching all over her and had all their parts where her parts are... She's been overused! Shoot!

   Should schools offer cash bonuses for good test scores?
  ","
  Maybe?...
  
  Maybe it will give them some kind of boost to wanting to study and succeed, but at the same time honestly they need to just want to earn it and just do it without being offered money or any kind of reward.
  
  When learning, you should just do it because you want to do it. To succeed. And I'm not saying don't celebrate in any type of way.. no.. you should celebrate. Be proud of yourself... but there is just.. like a type of moral that comes along with it... like.. if you have no interest in what you're doing and then get offered money and then.  all the sudden you are in.. then I feel like you don't want to do what you're doing in the first place... ? Why not just not do it? If you're not happy with what you're doing then why do it? But honestly school's not really going to be the funnest ride the whole time... you're going to have your hiccups and frustrations, but still.. you're studying something you're supposed to be soon enjoying. So you should get some sort of of / excitement out of it. But for some people they need a little bit of a push and some sort of boost. Some confidence.

   What benefits does art provide society? Does art hurt society in any way?
  ","
  Art can provide a lot of different things for society. And considering people have opinion and different views, art can make them happy, sad, angry, it just all depends. Art I find provide certain things for the brain that is needed. It gives us the opportunity to be creative and create what types of things/art that we like and our own way. I feel that art is a positive in my opinion. Though some art can give me different feelings also. Art can describe a whole story. To one person it could mean something completely different, to me could mean something also different. Different perspectives. It's good to be different. It's not always good to be the same.

  I'm a paranormal searcher. I explore and visit many different places. Most people hate on me for doing that and don't believe in it. That's fine to not believe in it. But not only me but many around me have caught and witnessed plenty and that's enough to make us believe so... Yeah. Everybody has perspective and opinion and that's fine just don't be disrespectful towards me and mine.

  Yes. This was probably one of the most hardest things for me to do was to bury my sweet grandmother. She was so much to this world that it was a tragedy just taking her out of it... I feel like the sky was crying... God was crying that day. But not just tears of sorrow, tears of joy because he gets to spend time with her now. We had our time and now it's his time with his wonderful person.
  
  When we were at the funeral the priest was saying today is not just a day of sorrow, it's a day of joy and it's a day to remember this person and try our best to mimic the way that she was, considering how wonderful of a person my grandmother was. I most definitely want to try my best to try to be like her. Use her as an inspiration in my life to be as kind as I can to people. There's not enough kindness in this world and I'm going to be a person to give it.

  This was right after we left the funeral site. It started to get extremely dark and rainy out and these are the flowers that they gave everybody at the funeral. What I think is a coincidence is right after we buried my grandmother the sky is falling out with horrible weather. Downpouring.
  
  She was a wonderful and kind woman. She was very generous and was always feeding and taking care of everyone else and worrying about everyone else. She was never selfish. Not once has she ever leave anyone hanging. She always made sure everybody felt comfortable first and then cared about herself.
  
  My grandmother was a very sweet woman. If anyone was feeling down she would always try to crack a joke and always had a hug waiting. My mama was a good cook and she new how to take care of all of her family.
  
  She will be very messed. This is a picture in her name. Love you Maw maw!

  You can make money just by keeping your phone on the lock screen and not texting and driving. You just have to keep the app up on your phone and keep the lock screen on and you make money while you drive. This app tries to get people to stop texting and driving because it can be dangerous for you and for other people. Especially bikers. I recommend it because you can literally make money by doing nothing. I'm at $35 and Jason is at 110 bucks.

   Do you believe,,, Poverty is the root of all evil.& The Ignorance, the root and stem of all evil.
  ","
  Ehh.. Depends on where ya mean on this question.. Are ya meaning.. the poor people are the problem? or the fact that no one will help them and put them in a home and feed them and stuff.. Cause honestly.. There is a story for/with each one and some of them want to be homeless. That's just how some people are. Literally.
  
  It's just like going to jail. Once you've done it for so long you adapt to that life.. and can't live like any other way, so people usually just prefer that life that they're living, at the time.. They try to change places and it's a shock to them.
  
  South wouldn't exactly say that it's the root of all evil. Either way. Cuz like I said each person / family has their own kind of story to it all some of them fall off the edge and lose everything and can't get back up and they have kids to take care of. It's still can be mistaken poor decision-making on their behalf but is understandable because as I said people make mistakes.
  
  Some people are poor because they throw everyone out their life and they have nobody. They can't work with people in an environment so the end of not having money to pay for bills or anythin. They got to do what they got to do to get money and live. And a lot of them end up behind bars. Not all of them but some because they don't get along with anyone. That's why they are poor. They just become trouble.
  
  Another instance is some parents have enough of their kids and they throw them out because they're not acting correctly or according to their standards. So they throw them out at a young age and they have nowhere to go and some of them become completely homeless. Living on the streets. Trying to work themselves up.
  
  Floods. Earthquakes. Not having the right insurances. People getting kidnapped and taken to other areas of their country or other countries and then when they finally escape they have nowhere to go. This is a more rare situation. There are so many ways that people become homeless it's an endless conversation. It's sad...

  My boots are probably the best purchase every single pair. I also love my dress boots. My husband just recently bought me some army boots and they have been doing me great.
  
  Sadly I love Converse. Journey Converse, Chuck Taylors, you know... I love those shoes. I always have since I was little. A while back I got some USA designer Converse snd they were just outstanding. I loved the shoes. They were gorgeous.
  
  I recently tried to buy them again, the same kind and was not able to find the replica made and found some that were made kind of like them but they were supposed to be All Star Converse. They were the same size as my other ones and for some odd reason I could not adjust to them. They're a little bit better on my feet noow but like.. when I first got them they were just made strange... almost like they ran small. But I have the same size and on my shoes and even one pair of that is one size smaller and fits me fine. But for some odd reason these seemed like they might have been knock-offs. I still use them. They are still really pretty but I wish that I would have maybe return them right after I got them and got my money back because they just did not seem like the regular All Star Converse. But like I said mistakes happen. And plus I got them for a good price.
  
  Another good purchase that I got was at a Whole Foods I got a huge salad for only $7 and it consisted of eight different leafy green choices, carrots, strawberries, tofu, cucumber, chicken, egg, celery, and so much more. It was a heavy salad that I got for only 7 bucks and ate off for awhile. That was a really good purchase.

  ","
  I do usually. Depends on when drinking in the temperature of it. If it's warm tea I will add a lot of ice because it's going to melt into it anyway. Just have to have a straw or spoon to stir it while drinking it.
  
  But if it's coke or tea that is cold then I am not going to add too much ice because it takes up too much room it down.
  
  If it is alcohol then I usually like a lot of ice but I also have to have a mixer.

  Magnet fishing is getting metal and other items that can being stuck to a magnet out the water. It's both adventurous and good for the environment. It's not good to have all them cars, rust, oil, metal and the water. Though it can be illegal in some areas because of trespassing laws and the danger it can have doing it. Discovering some items can be dangerous because some are really really old bombs that have not gone off yet.l. If you go magnet fishing I would take an old veteran or someone that knows a lot about explosives. Be very careful and always wear gloves. Do not stand on the side of bridges and pick up things that are really heavy too high because you don't want to get flung into the water. If you find a gun then make sure you call the authorities and report it because it could be the answer to an unsolved murder. You can also help people like that. Magnet fishing is mostly for cleaning the environment. Good videos for YouTube. Just make sure you know the laws where you're at before fishing.

   Why are people dishonest? WHY do people sometimes steal or be negative?
  ","
  Because they aren't happy with their lives. They see that they can't be like other people that are doing good, so they lie to make it seem like they're doing better than what they really are.
  
  For instance some people lie about having cancer. Some people lie about having a fancy car or about the way they look so they can draw certain people in. Or some people lie that they hang out with certain types of people, like celebrities. When in the end when they get those people in their lives they see that they were lying and then they don't to be around them. They become what you're saying.
  
  But who truly knows why people do it. Usually because they are sad and have nothing else better to do. Some people lie and are ugly to others to get satisfaction from it all. Especially online keyboard Warriors and catfish folk.

   It's very important to take care of yourself. Everyone's lives are so busy. Take at least an hour a day to recharge and do whatever makes you better. For grown-ups, whether it's a spa, sitting in a park with a book, or coffee, take time for yourself.

   Actually ... to be original, having let someone pick a tattoo for you, wouldnot that be the case?
  ","
  Depends. Is it a picture off of google of someone's arm inwhich already has the picture, then no. It's not original. But in a sense of them designing it and it be literally based off of being only new ideas and originality.
  
  Anybody can make a new tattoo and it be 100% original; nobody else has it. Unless of course you're going to go with the idea of having the same tattoo as another person. AKA having matching tattoos. That's different. Delete tattoo maybe more used unless you both came up with a new original tattoo together.
  
  I've had people bring tattoos in and then the artist fixing the tattoo to making it more original, that's kinda like letting someone else pick it.
  
  But like if someone is like.. Yo.. What kinda tattoo should I get and then they just look at their arm and is like.. That. Something like that and then they go get that and then that's not exactly original.
  
  Like from off the top of your head. New. Different. Created. Orginal.

  This book is a good book to read to make you click on to reality. It affected me negatively and positively. The book is extremely graphic and is very pushing on the mind... it's really hard to explain. It's very depressing. Scary. Makes you feel really bad and sad for the person in the book. It almost makes me want to jump into the story and save her. Makes you nervous and makes you think too much I feel. A positive impact on me because it opened up my eyes to the real world and to knowing and learning how to keep myself safe and be aware more. Because anything can happen to you. Life is precious.

  I've seen and heard these kinds of situations and most of the time when the child grows up 100% in the wild they are not like a human, they are like whatever animal they were raised by.

  She decided not to take my word for it. The person that she wanted to date was a cheater and a druggie and she decided to go with it and we stopped talking as friends. I don't hang out with people that do drugs. That would put a negative influence in my life. Usually when you hang out with people that do drugs, you do drugs. I let her know that he was more than likely going to cheat on her because I could tell, and not even a while later of dating him, he did cheat on her and I stopped talking to her because everything I kept warning her about she to do the opposite about. She didn't care about herself. She was stealing things from my family and lying. Hygiene was not well and her environment in her house was not cleaned. There was nothing I could do about it. I don't know if you count that as a small stupid thing but yeah I gave many chances.

  Yesterday I was in the kitchen and Jason is in the bedroom and all the sudden I heard the door open and slam against the wall. I didn't think anything of it and a few minutes later when I asked Jason if he slammed the door and he said no he thought it was me. There was no one else I could have done this. I was freaked out for a few minutes knowing that the door moved on its own and slammed against the wall. No air. No nothing.

   Belle! Everybody knows it’s not good to mess with a Ouija board!!! That’s how you anger the spirits!!!
  ","
  Sadly not everybody knows this and ones that do, still use them. I've been researching Ouija boards for over a decade. Ouija boards cause more than 85% if not 90% of hauntings in the world. Without them the world would be a way better place in the spiritual world. There would be, more than likely, less psychotic killers. Considering if there wasn't so much negative energy on the planet, there wouldn't be so many negative people. So not everybody knows that you're not supposed to mess with them. Most of the time people do the opposite.

   Woah, so do they haunt the people, who visit that place or they also follow the person, afterwards?
  ","
  Depends. Sometimes they just hurt people and other times they don't. And negative presences can haunt people and places and items. Not every time when you go to the place, no. Usually when you make some sort of communication with them, they will follow you but not every time it just depends. When you play Ouija boards they can attach themselves to you, so you don't want to play them. When you use dowsing rods, they can attach themselves to you. When you do spirit boxes, they can attach themselves to you. When you do the writing paper trick, this is kind of like using the Ouija board. But if even other objects, they can attach themselves. When you seem weak and scared they usually attack those kinds of people. When you make them angry they will also. You don't ever want to anger and challenge a negative presence. When you take certain objects from haunted places sometimes they will follow you because of the objects. Usually when you leave the areas/places you usually say a prayer. You also tell whatever that is there, to not follow you, that it is not allowed to follow you to your home.

  I remember the times during the Hurricanes when my Maw maw would let us come and stay with her because where we live that was a little bit less safe. Her house was a lot safer. Plus if something happened we could get her out safe and we were all together if something happened to all of us.
  
  Another good memory is when I would come and stay at her house she would get McDonald's for me and my sister's if we all stayed. We would always get the McDonald's McFlurries. And for some reason that meant the world to us. We could also get donuts every morning and watch Disney Channel movies with her and play board games when we got bored. Plus we want to spend time with her while we were there.
  
  Another good memory is when we used to go to the food bank (that she started and she fed people for over 30 years) and help feed the poor and give out food to people that did not have anything and supplies. I would help her out. There's lots of memories with my grandmother and my grandpa. All wonderful.

  I'm okay with all of them as long as today's generation isn't one of them and trying to kill me.
  
  Nowadays they have a movie for everything trying to kill someone. And in real life there's actual and insane people that try to do these things. Terrible... But at the same time... That's fine, the movies I mean.. The people doing these crimes.. No. But that's life..
  
  People miss the joke. Like clowns... They are supposed to be funny! It's a joke! Or supposed to be... They get defensive and miss a joke..
  
  I've seen/heard actual people go out in public and almost get killed by like dressed up clowns and stuff.
  
  Me myself and I I like party clowns that are trying to be too happy.. lol trying and/or be funny and goofy or even sappy at times. That's usually what clowns were back in the day. That's how I still look at them? Now. Killers because of all these movies. It's whatever tho.
  
  And I love magicians. I used to do all kinds of magic when I was little. That was something I really enjoyed. I'm fine with ventriloquists. I have seen a bunch of them.
  
  Same with Impressionists. I have seen a bunch of them.
  
  All very talented, cool and funny.

   Ways nd tips to reach a healthy relationship..
  ","
  Gotcha.
  
  I figured.
  
  Constant communication always. This is most important in any relationship. If you do not have constant steady communication you cannot have a healthy relationship. Don't get so jealous of one another and let want another be free to talk to whoever they want. In an appropriate way of course.  Don't be possessive or controlling.
  
  Be able to talk to each other about pretty much everything. Be able to sit down and vent to them when you're upset about anything. Listen to one another. Always have trust for one another. Loyalty must be there. You have to have patience in any relationship. Always be taking care of one another. This is for many different levels. You want to take notice to their health and make sure that they're fully okay. Mentally physically everything. You just always have each other's backs. Protecting each other from anything and everything. Being able to work together is a very important thing in a relationship. Be fair with one another. Give each other attention. Affection and romance. Have your own type of chemistry with one another. Make things interesting. Be spontaneous. Don't always do things the same. Surprise one another every now and then. If you get in an argument with one another step away take a moment out and then come back to one another and reason with each other and talk about it. Everything should be able to be worked out in a relationship. You should not stay mad at one another about anything. And final just love one another fully. Give it your all. You want to look up to them as a figure you want to be. They're supposed to be wonderful to you, everything. The world. ? Soulmate. Companion.

   Is Southern hospitality a real thing?
  ","
  Absolutely. I was born and raised with doors open and people coming in and out and always feeding every mouth that came to the door.
  
  We always had troops coming in and out family, friends, strangers and you have to house them and feed them and take care of them. If you remember the Second Amendment and we did just that or at least I had family and law that did that. But of course we did the same also when it came down to it.
  
  During the unexpected storms and floods we have around 40 different people and more than three-quarters of them were strangers. We fed and took care of them and made sure everyone had food and water. Made sure everyone was comfortable as they could be.
  
  Everything I say is true and has happened in my life. We trying to do everything and anything for anyone. Help anyone.
  
  Southern Hospitality exists if you make it happen. And that's what we do.

  The problem with staying at apartments where I live at, is it's extremely dangerous. You can literally get shot and kill then you can't have animals and I have animals.
  
  There's other reasons why people think twice before getting an apartment, because 98% of the time it's not worth it. But I completely understand. If there was a safe apartment around here for only $1,000 a month that accepted pets, then I would probably would do it.

  Sadly... When people pass away that are very close to your family. Such as grandma grandpa, mom, or dad... Imma let you know now... that your family may not be the same.... Or it will seem like it.. some people may have trouble coping with it and we'll talk less, hang out less, act different... But they don't mean to. It's just the way that they're coping with it. It might push people away... It might pull the family apart a little bit but that's just part of it... I do want to tell you that now before it hits you bad.
  
  Use this as a way to be stronger in your life. We all lose people. Especially people that are close like that. It's just up to you to work with it. Much love always.

  ","
  I love that show. WWYD
  
  And if it was me and my husband there together depending on if it was the woman or the male.
  
  I would take action on the girl if she was trying to hurt the dude (unless the mfer has a knife then he's on his own..) (But I told you my best to conceal carry and protect what I can, call the police, try to reason with the girl and calm her down) (Or offer her money or flowers. Bishes love flowers and money. Jk.  Reference.) But honestly... I would probably just try to calm her down if she was going at the dude or something to where I could notice.
  
  And if she kept attacking to attack him I probably would jump on top of her ash try to hold her down until someone came.
  
  For sure if it was the dude hurting the girl my husband would take action. (My husband is a correctional officer and he can work with bounty hunting if he wanted to, could also work in the police force, knows certain martial arts, knows how to maneuver knives and guns out of people's hands, he's also a big and tall mfer. ? lol. He'd probably scare the dude. He also conceale carries and also carries a knife. Same as I.) But he has defended many before. Walking in a Walmart he watched a dude start hitting a woman he walked up to the dude and knocked him cold, out. He didn't even know them. Then he looked at the woman and said don't you ever let him lay a hand on you again. You deserve better.  And then walked away.
  
  Me and my husband are not the kind of people to sit there and watch something happen. We're the kind of people to take action.
  
  I would probably sit there and talk to the girl until the police came after. If she was to get hit.
  
  This is what we would do.

We all did and now we don't have the house there anymore... At all. So its just sad ya know? Almost seems like ya can't go back to memories kinda ya know?
  
  And when I say... Our entire family... Like the whole family.. Friends.. Of the family.. Cousins of cousins.. Aunts and uncles.. Pets and all lived and grew up there. Even during the storms and floods we would let random dozens of people stay there. It was a home that fed and sheltered many.

  ","
  Each to its own.
  
  Your dad didn't like what was done to him and the funeral... so your dad did it back to him kinda what was done to hum. Lesson learned. Treated your cousin as he did to him (your dad). (Hopefully your cousin caught it though what he was tryna' do ya know?)
  
  Some people do things to people and don't realize the karma that can come into place after. Some people would do the same stuff to you that you did to them That kinda follows the golden rule in life a little.
  
  Give respect as respect is given to you.
  
  Treat others as you would want to be treated.
  
  Though at the end of the day we all should be people an overlook situations but I do understand that it was a funeral and that is kind of a little messed up for people to be like that. Youngings do stuff like that all the time. They need to learn. Y'all decided to teach him in this way. Hopefully the way you guy's taught him well in this way. So that in the future, he's not like this again.

  Wanna know the crazy thing is. It's an enemy. I guess you could say. Well.. They don't like me. Don't know why. Never have done anything to them.
  
  After that, I think it made them think twice.
  
  Caught them from falling.
  
  I overlook all that and still try to help. How I always am.

  Don't just be friends with anybody. Be careful with picking your friends. Cuz what you're speaking of is possible. I'm sorry that happened to you. And I have not had too many of these because as I said I'm really careful with who I pick as my friends. Just turn the other cheek. Keep your head up. Go find better friends. As I said just be careful.

46603,"
   In your opinion, is it okay to be friends with an ex? How about if you're in a relationship with someone else?
  ","
  It's okay to be friends with anyone even an ex it just depends on how far you bring the conversations with them. Even if you're in a relationship.
  
  I grew up with a few of them even before we even dated we were friends and after we've always been friends. Just didn't work out.
  
  (Though I have some exes I don't talk to at all, just because we went our separate ways and just didn't want to talk anymore at all even as friends.) husband is fine with him and is good friends with him also. We don't talk every single day or see each other every single day but every now and then we check in with him.
  
  It's okay to be friends with your ex. Even if you're in a relationship. You have lines that don't need to be cross with anyone. Ex. or just people in general. Just depends on how far you take the convo. Also, that's when trust and loyalty comes in.
  "
46604,"
   Do you believe people should earn your respect? Or should you give respect first until they do you wrong in some way?
  ","
  I think people should be respectful at the beginning both ways towards one another. I don't really think earn the respect? Like... If said in a despiteful sort of kind of way. I think people should just be respectful to one another and then if someone is ugly to them and comes at them sideways in disrespectful ways then the respect line has been crossed and no more respect shall be given.
  "
46605,"
   That's very true. I miss my doggy.

  I hear ya.
  
  I had one really really good dog that grew up with me throughout my life that passed when I was about 13 or 14 years old and I think she was either 15 or 14 and me and her shared the same birthday. Her name was angel. Best dog ever!

  Get married to someone and then ban their spouse from ever speaking to another human? All humans married or not should be l able to speak to whoever they want. Up to them how far they want to take the conversation. That's when morals come in.

Coincidence that I ended up getting to go... going to. Louisiana thinking that I wasn't going to be able to go anyway... (and miss it) then was able to go?!

  You should definitely stay positive. You're a wonderful person whether you think you are not. I definitely enjoy your company.

Save one's life.  that is literally the best place to go and get a dog. You can get one of the puppy or you can get one mid-aged.

  Kind've is a contraction.
  
  Kind've is the words
  
  Kind of
  
  I'm not sure if it is even a official contraction, but people use it. People still use that one.
  
  In America, we use them time to time.
  
  Itis aword or phrase that has been shortened by dropping one or more letters. In writing, an apostrophe is used to indicate the place of the missing letters.
  
  Theyare commonly used in speech (or written dialogue), informal forms of writing, and where space is at a premium, such as in advertising.
  
  They are also used in American slang time to time.
  
  You may have to use the contraction chart. They're not that hard to read it all. Basically just tell you what each word is. Like the 2 words it comes together to make.
  
  Or you can just can look up the translation of them separately.
  
  Here are some examples of contractions.
  
  Haven't
  
  Have not
  
  Wasn't
  
  Was not
  
  Can't
  
  Cannot or can not
  
  Hasn't

  Couldn't

   Do u have any fears???? What do u often do to overcome ?????? it ?
  ","
  1st
  
  ___
  
  I have plenty of fears but I usually try to face them. Like.. I don't like snakes really, but I still try to hold them whenever I get the chance be around them.
  
  One time we had a snake in our store and I almost went up to it picked it up because it wasn't a venomous one. I mean honestly what's the worst they can do bite you? I'm sure it would really hurt that bad. I've had worse happen to me.
  
  2nd
  
  ___
  
  I don't really like being around a lot of people at once with a lot of noise and lots of things going on. Gets me nervous and makes me panic. I get frustrated, because I'm trying to talk to someone in front of me and I can't hear them or someone else is trying to talk to me at the same time. Too much at once. Though I still try to fight through it all and try to understand them. I feel like that's still facing your fear? Right. Just being there and enduring it I feel.
  
  3rd
  
  ___
  
  Driving. I am not much of a driver because I have had way too many horrible life-threatening experiences though I still trying to drive every now. Trying to slowly learn how to... but I am in no hurry up fully learn how to drive. It's not that I don't know how to drive, it's because every time I get in the car it seems like somebody is almost hitting and killing me. Same with someone else driving. I just feel more safe with someone else with their quick reaction and maneuvering.
  
  I used to have a really quick reaction time but over the years it is starting to fade away. I really need to get back to into playing volleyball. Playing volleyball requires quick reaction time and when practicing and learning and getting better at volleyball you develop faster reaction time. I feel that that is a good stimulant for me to learn how to drive to. A help. With driving, you have to be aware of everything. Same as volleyball and like I said you got to be quick.
  "
46755,"
   Which flavour of pizza you like???
  ","
  Absolutely lot of thin crust pizza with light sauce extra cheese and lots of toppings on top. My favorite top is going to have to be bacon, ham, sausage. And then every now and I like black olives onions bell peppers on it too. I also like meatballs on my pizza too.
  
  I also like stuffed crust pizzas too. BBQ Pizza. Macaroni Pizza and of course dessert pizza

   If you could create a public holiday, what would it be called and what is it about? ?

  Depends on what kind of person you are. I like to have lots of good friends. But I grew up in a very happy, friendly environment around tons of people. So I guess I'm just used to that. I'm used to just walking into a room with like 50 people and everybody is cool with you. But I guess I know what you mean by like really really close friends.

  He want I made me a cute little wooden carved knife with tons of detail. It was just adorable. Is little bitty knife.
  
  They put together my engagement ring. Designed it. Absolutely love that.
  
  I had been wanting a pot to cook some of my Maw maw's and mama's homemade recipes and there was a certain type of pot (it was a casserole dish) I really wanted and my mom ended up going online and buying it for me out of nowhere after me talking about it with her. I thought that was 100% thoughtful because she saw that I really wanted it and I guess it was really didn't look into getting in or finding where I could get it and she just did it for me. I love the gift so much. Means everything to me now. Cooking is in my blood. I love my family. Love their cooking and want to continue the delicious homemade recipes that they made from me. I want to make them for my children and other friends.

   (Asking out of curiosity, because I'm actually autisitc) What do you know about autism? What stereotypes have you heard about autism? And does anyone in your life have autism? (feel free to ignore if this is too personal)
  ","
  I actually didn't know that you were autistic.
  
  Nothing wrong with that.
  
  Autism can be many different things.
  
  A serious development disorder that impairs  the ability to communicate and interact.
  
  Autism spectrum disorder and pack the nervous system and much more.
  
  Autism can be way more than just what I listed.
  
  __
  
  I was actually really really good friends with someone that was autistic for a very long time. Over the years we lost communication with one another. I wish that I could talk to him again and know that he's doing okay. But idk. Who knows..
  
  __
  
  And I have a very big soft spot for special need folk, especially ones that don't know any better.
  
  If you know what I mean by that.
  
  Like for ex:
  
  When in high school one time at P.E. we were playing basketball and exercising and stuff and someone decided to start picking on one of the autistic fellos for no reason.
  
  This fello I think was autistic, on tendency has tantrums and he has certain ways that he has to do things.
  
  He does not like to share.
  
  He will attack you even and come at you if you don't leave him alone. He will even have outbursts and attack you randomly.
  
  He literally does not know any better and cannot fend for himself. Clearly... And this other kid in our class, he was making fun of him and trying to take the ball from him bothering him much as he could purposely trying to make him angry and he just wouldn't leave him alone..
  
  He was playing just fine on his own.. And this kid has to come over and bother him and make it a laughing manner? A joke.
  
  I actually got pretty pissed off and walked up to him and immediately squared up and defended the guy and I made it known that if he wasn't going to leave him alone that day I was going to beat his ash.
  
  I just don't appreciate people that take it as a way of joke for themselves.. considering the people with the disabilities never chose this life it was brought to them from birth.
  
  I take big deal in it.
  
  Keep being wonderful you. ?
  
  Always so nice!?

   How do you fare when it comes to arguments? Do you keep your cool or do you have a temper? Or do you try to avoid arguments all together?
  ","
  I usually just try to avoid them all together, but people come at me sideways all the time. Just because I'm really open-minded and some people don't like people like that. I think people should be like that. I think it's cool to just respect everybody. That's more or less how I look at it.
  
  But when it comes to an argument I mean... unless it's really that important I usually just try to pick my fights very well. Most the time I just ignore people.
  
  Bur if someone tries to say something about me that is false and I'm right there, then I'm going to justify what it is and what the truth is.
  
  I'm not afraid to expose somebody. I'm not afraid to tell somebody something but I'm not going to sit there and get angry about something that's not worth it.
  
  But a lot of the times I just kill people with backs. Kill them with kindness. Or ignore them. Ignoring is the best comeback. Ignoring someone can piss somebody off completely.
  
  It is very hard to get me at a high temper and angry.

   How do u do photo poll in ask fm?
  ","
  Just like you would when you go to your hub at the bottom to create a question to send to someone, there is an option to do a voting poll.
  
  You click it and then you add two photos, usually different photos, to vote from. Then add maybe a description of what the first one is on the left and then a description of the other one on the right and then you let it load and people vote on it.
  
  You can do voting polls differently than what I'm saying, this is just an example to helo know how to make them. Find them.
  
  You don't have to do it exactly the way I'm saying. You can just put two pictures up and let him vote. You don't have to put a description at all, but to me I feel like it's better. But again you can do it however you'd like.
  
  Here's an example below of where you need to go to create the voting poll and this is an example of what you can do. This is one of mine.

  Yeah I'm appreciative of having rights. I don't take that for granted.
  
  Some others do and may.
  
  The sad thing is people don't know their rights. Regardless of going to school and learning it and taking tests on it. Being raised in the country. And at the end of the day still don't know their rights or maybe not understand them.
  
  Which some can't help it. Which is fine. But I think everyone should have the opportunity to know their rights. So people won't walk all over ya. Ya don't know them, people will. In the court of law, it is important to know your rights. Cause of course, they have good and bad people everywhere. Better to be prepared for whatever.

  ","
  Back down in Louisiana we have tons of Christmas traditions that we follow. Including shortly after Halloween putting the Christmas tree up at my Maw maw's and Paw paw's house. And then we go and put the one up at my mom's house. Then we save up a little bit of money and periodically throughout October, November and December gather gifts for one another and wrap them for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. We usually cook for Christmas day. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day we usually have some goodies for breakfast. Christmas Eve we always open one early gift. One my mom got us. And then Christmas morning anywhere from seven eight or nine in the morning we open gifts at the house and then around 10 to 11 we go to my Maw maw's and Paw paw's and we wait around an hour or two and then we open gifts there and eat and chit chat until about 1 or 2 or 3. Sometimes we will go to a few other families houses and friends houses and exchange gifts. Attend Christmas parties with the family and more.
  
  We usually decorating go all out for Christmas. Christmas is my favorite time of the year and is also when I was born. My mom said I was due for Christmas morning and I was a few days late. My birthday is on December 29th.
  
  Also you can never forget the Christmas music and Christmas activities! They're always there!
  
  I love the winter it's cool out. I love cold. I also love New Years because there's fireworks! But yes we have family traditions. I love this time of the year because it seems just peaceful to me.  so many exciting events!

   One unpopular parenting opinion
  ","
  I think everybody has their own way of disciplining their children. I think they should stick to the way that they do it as long as you're not beating the crap out of their children out of anger and hate.
  
  They are not neglecting child in anyway.
  
  I think it's important throughout the child's life to always try to regulate certain rules, morals, regulations and responsibilities in order to teach them when they get older what they need to do.
  
  Kids should be taught patients at every bit they can. Try to get kids to understand what self-respect is. Then to respect others also.
  
  Not to reward bad behavior. I see this so much. Yes raise your kids the way you want. But I think in any situation you should not reward bad behavior. That's just my opinion though.
  
  I'm sure these are all popular opinions... but these are the things that I feel like should be in kids lives while growing up.

   What’s the annoying thing about emptiness? Why does it trouble us and weigh us down?
  ","
  Because in this generation I feel that everybody thinks that you can't be alone. That you always HAVE to have someone there. People are constantly pushing themselves into a relationship that they don't even want to be in... and just so they can escape the ""emptiness"" or escape loneliness.. or the feeling of being lost or empty.
  
  I honestly think that there's nothing wrong with being by yourself? ? I think people need to give themselves more credit. I once was by myself and everything was fine. It gives you time to figure yourself out. Focus on yourself. Adapt and take care of yourself.
  
  Of course over time you figure out what you were purpose is and you go with it. In life you'll find your soulmate sooner in and sometimes it takes a little longer. Sometimes you'll find out that being alone is better for you. Maybe just owning a pet or two. It just all depends. Everybody has figure it out. All I say is take your time with it. You got your whole life ahead of you. I mean don't take 50 years?! ...but I mean take your time in life. Like I always say go with the flow.

  I painted it for my husband and me. (For him)
  
  Him, always representing the blue and me representing the red. And we were in a long-distance relationship for 4 and 1/2 years, finally ending it a little more than a year ago and getting married too! ?
  
  We've been together for 6 years. And what does blue and red make when they come together? purple which if you look really close underneath the heart where the blue and red come together it has a little bit of purple.
  
  Why does it have the saying.. ""Had me at Hello""?
  
  Because it is just the same saying I've always said about him. He's always had me at hello. ❤ It is saying that I've always said when we first started dating and I still say today. Sometimes I wish I could go back and meet him all over again.

  I do have a lava lamp.
  
  I've had many in the past also.
  
  This was, I think the first gift my husband ever got me or I think it was the first Valentine's Day we spent together. One of the two or both.
  
  His favorite color is blue. So blue it always represented him and my favorite color is red so red as usually always symbolize me.
  
  So he got me this lava lamp and it is blue and the lava inside of it is red, so when it turns on the colors comes together and makes a purple pink. We were in a long distance relationship when he got this for me. We were always wanting to be together. So it was a very sweet and thoughtful gift.
  
  Plus I love lava lamps. They can keep you warm when you're freezing.
  
  I love the gift and still have it! I treated like a baby! Next, I want to get a black one that has white lava in it next! Or a glitter one! That would be cool!
  
  _____________
  
  You do have to take the caution with using/having lava lamps. You do not want to have them on for too many hours. It usually takes about an hour and a half for them to actually make the lava move in them. After having them on for about 2-3 hours after the lava starts to move I would turn them off...
  
  Put lava lamps in an area where you know they're not going to fall and break because the chemicals inside of it are very harmful to the skin. (I'm sure) The eyes. (I'm sure) & obviously.. because it's hot. Plus you don't want to get that on your floor wall or carpet...  I would keep lava lamps away from anything plastic and metal related. Considering the hot heat couldn't heat up other metal and could melt the plastic around it.
  
  Yes you have to take precaution. But everything in life can be dangerous. Even a simple straw is becoming world-wide disastrous and dangerous. Lol. Literally.

  And I guess chicken on the bone is just too much work? The bones freak us out? I don't know. I didn't have much of a problem with chicken on the bone as a kid.

   If you ask questions about your partner’s ex out of the blue, and they give you “Can we not talk about it anymore?” Altho your partner has talked about it before. Would you say that your partner has still feelings for their ex?
  ","
  Depends.
  
  They could just not want to talk about it because usually people don't really like talking about their exes. Though not all ex relationships are horrible.
  
  I'm friends with a few of mine just because I grew up with some of them. But we aren't associated ALL time, every single day with one another... That is not good. No. And I don't want to be. That's my ex. But I'm not going to be ugly to anyone. I just check in every now and then with some of them. But that's a personal thing. I just like to make sure everybody's good. Some my exes have been troubled in life and some of them are moving along good with their life. All good to hear when someone is doing well at least. Even my husband is good friends with some of them. As I said not all exes are horrible. There are a few that I choose not to talk to? Yes. But I don't really mind talking about any of them. But some people may have went through way worse things than some of us. Some people have been raped, abused, practically killed, tortured, etc... You just don't know... but it definitely depends on how they're going about the situation. Because I mean anything could happen.
  
  What you're saying has different ways that it could go. But some people just might not be comfortable with talking about it.
  
  But definitely just don't assume too much. Assuming too much in a relationship can ruin a relationship. There should just be constant communication and trust.
  
  Maybe ask them what's the reason why they don't want to talk about it. Is it because they're uncomfortable? or is it because maybe they still like them? I mean... It's okay if it's still like them. Because that person might have been in a really good relationship with them and the other person just might have threw them out or something? Really sad.. But they don't need to be thinking about them fully like that anymore, they need to be moving on. Especially if they're in another relationship with you. I could see why you could be discouraged. Best of luck.

  But I also don't like it when people push their beliefs on me. If I don't like something. Leave me be, that's me. You be you and I'll be me. I respect you if you respect me. Simple don't come at me sideways.

  Not exactly sure what I would remove.
  
  But if I could keep sewing and culinary classes in school still I would. Because they're starting to take these out. Or at least sewing.
  
  I feel like they should teach people the basics in the kitchen so they can cook a little bit for themselves. Prepare a simple Thanksgiving at home. I feel that people would want this. I wish I could have had it more in school because I like cooking. Even before I went to HighSchool I love to cook. And sewing is important. I don't care who says it's not. I feel like that is a small but important thing to know that comes in handy.
  
  If I could teach something in school. I would probably take on some sort of a history class or geography class. Take on some early atmospheric science / weather class.
  
  Or I would be a coach for volleyball. I love volleyball. I love volleyball.

   ""What do you do when the power goes out during a storm""? My home has a home generator and I make certain that it's ready to be used.
  ","
  Yeah. When the power used to go out. I used to go to my Maw maw's or my Nanny's (Aunt's) house back down in Louisiana. Just because going to Maw maw's house was always fun. And of course I love going to my aunt's house. She also had a generator. But I love spending time with her anyway. But it's good to have a generator. Especially hooked up to your appliances. Just in case cuz you don't want things in the refrigerator and freezer to go bad. I like to have washer and dryer working and the air conditioner. Those are my must-haves. But when the power goes out I make sure to barbecue and have lots of food for everybody. Have candles and flashlights available. Lots of water. We read or play board games or cards or draw. Sometimes we'll go outside and play in the water. Barbecue and have parties.

  That's not always the case. Definitely depends. Maybe the reason why they ask you that is because they feel insecure about themselves? Like maybe they feel like you're not a good enough friend? Again and securities. It also could mean if they don't want to talk to you. But it definitely depends as I said. Don't be so discouraged about it. Just sit down with them and ask them honestly what it is. They'll tell you what they mean. And if they are saying it in the way that you were saying that maybe that's not a good friend and you shouldn't be friends with them anymore.

  I'd make ya one if was easier to get it over there without having it mess up.

  But if there's ever an issue with anyone that I know I always try my best to turn it around. Even enemies.
  
  We have this one lady that comes in my job. I'm not from here? So there's no reason for anyone to not like me right off the bat really. Considering I'm talking about my job. Where I work. If all I have said, ""Hi. How are you doing? How may I help you?"" Like I'm supposed to do... at my job... I don't know if she thought I was somebody else maybe that she didn't like? Or something? I don't know? But this person also has hated me from day one and I don't know why? As I said I have never done anything to them wrong. Nothing.
  
  But the other day I was at the Dollar General and I saw her and I kindly said hello, how are you doing and it surprised her so much that she actually answered me back in a kind way. (kill them with kindness) I laughed and joked with her and she was absolutely overjoyed that I spoke to her. I even helped her find something for her phone before I left and I didn't even work there. Was just tryna' be nice. ? Even with my enemies. I think it might have been where I worked at. She might not have liked anybody there. But the thing about it is I was new? and was treating her correctly? and she still did not like me! Lol ? wtf? Why shop there? I don't know some people just have issues I guess. Which I'm one hundred percent sure she did. It's whatever.

   How do you feel about seeing a person who is homeless?
  ","
  I would probably have a lot of people living with me. If only I could take them all in and know if be safe. If I had the room and money. If I was able to provide. Every time I see a homeless person I almost want to take them home and cook them food and give them a nice warm bath and give them a comfortable bed. I feel sad. And want to help them regardless of what has happened to them.
  
  One time during a bad natural disaster flood we took been around 40 different people and we had a very tiny space. Only a few rooms. Only a few beds. But everybody had pallets and blankets and was sleeping on the floors and everybody was fed. We even took them one that was disabled and in a wheelchair. We didn't care what was going on with them... just took them in. But slowly we got them back to where they need to go. ? I remember going to the store and buying around 15 12 packs of Cokes. Seeing that they around 15 12 packs of Cokes. I just wanted to help. Provide for them with what I had. My whole family try to help them. The neighbors. And the whole neighborhood helped as well. Took some of them and as well for us so they would have more room. But like I said we got them to where they need to go eventually.

  But ummm..  getting married isn't about waiting to a certain age. Getting married is making sure that you're (both are) for sure that you want to marry that person regardless of your age.
  
  When you two are ready. Then that is a descion made between two together.
  
  Though I don't really recommend anyone go and get married at 16??
  
  I think that people should at least wait until they can make their own decisions. Let the mind understand life. But again that is based off of perception. Opinion.
  
  We, me and him were actually both for sure that we wanted to marry each other 4 years ago. Tho get that we wanted to get married then but was kind've hard to considering we were in a long distance relationship for four and a half years.
  
  After fighting the distance for so long we finally were able to be together and we got married. We've been together for 6 years they met back in April of 2014.
  
  We are super happy together. We've been married for about a year now. That's a decision that me and him made. Nobody else.
  
  There are no complications at all. Everything is perfect.

  I don't know but I've been wondering the same thing for years. People are forgetting how marriage works. People are forgetting that it's extremely important and you need to make sure that's what you want to do before you do it so that doesn't happen. And what I'm referring to is what you're saying. Getting married and then 48 Hours end up divorcing the person. A divorce should be only made when something serious is going on. Honestly, they should just work it out anyway. That's what marriage is about. I'm married and have been with the person I'm with for 6 years. I don't find any reason to leave them and we work out absolutely everything. I see what you mean in our country. America. I talk about it every single day. And the scary thing is it's starting to happen everywhere. Is this generation. People act like they can't be alone... and if someone disagrees with them... then they freaked out and have to get away from their problems by running.

(this is her usual... all her life) (this is also pretty much all she knows and it now probably like this a little too) (this kind've life this person is living a negative life.. can become a negative spirit. Poltergeist* other word for it ..sad to think about..)  but the process... she is chased around her house.. with a gun by her father.... she's slamming doors to get away.. throwing things... chairs.. and is just hysterical.. obviously... cause she is living a nightmare for sake.. she is getting she is screaming for her life and yelling and crying then finally.. you hear the boom.
  
  The point of the story is important... 15 years later... The house is still left the same.. All the items are left where they were 15 years ago when this ""normal"" family onced lived... it is now a time capsule. Literally.
  
  Some explorer's... Like me... or others... Then come in and investigate the once lived and is now... what it seems to be on repeat?? the situation? The murderer? because... ya hear the slamming of doors?? off and on.. at the same time when she was running... when she was trying to escape him... you hear the screams occasionally... when she is able to manifest enough... poor soul.. you see chair move? things thrown occasional?! like her... when she was trying to protect and escape him... and then you hear the gunshot. No one is there? That is the research and reality, an example in seeing a literal trapped... and lost soul. That may not even realize that they are gone? because it happened so fast... seems unreal...
  
  People can be skeptical.. that's fine. I respect it completely. But I don't think I would be on this subject as long as I have been if I wasn't on to something. And it ain't just me. There are thousands curious like me. Researching the history like me. Exploring like me. Wondering like me.

Terrible.
  
  Here. A lot of people are real messy. They were back down where I was from too. But here it's like different. Everybody wants to intervene in relationships. If they want to be friends with you. It's only because they want to sleep with you. Regardless of marriage. Down in Louisiana... where you had pals and more and it wasn't all about that all the time. Idk... Honestly.. I don't think it has to do with the places. I think that's just a generation and me getting older. I don't know.

  Trying to make it seem like school's out! No school today! But of course you were just joking and we cleaned it up and gave the principle of good laugh! That's what we really wanted to do was make everybody really laugh.
  
  And then one day we baby powder the entire senior hallway through glitter everywhere and blew up like 200 balloons and threw them everywhere. We did that for one of our favorite teachers and the principal and they thought it was hilarious. Again we cleaned it all up.
  
  And then one day we filled up the entire principal's office with balloons to the point where if you open the door only balloons would come out and he couldn't get in. Then we put glitter in his toilet and stuck a balloon in there too. He laughed so hard at this and then we took all the furniture out and put it in the front hallway made it look like front hallway was the office instead. Again we cleaned all this. We just wanted to give everyone a good laugh. This was at the end of the school year.

That teaching them a lesson. Embarrassing them. People will learn eventually. Humans can be repetitive. We can complete tasks over and over again. So there's no reason to deny doing it again.

  ","
  Yeah the food is really good down here. I like Louisiana food. I was born and raised in Louisiana.  I love spicy food ! But yeah... Raising Cane's is good too. They have a signature sauce called, ""Cane's Sauce."" Most people don't like it at first... You have to develop a taste for it. I did... And then then it slowly becomes a craving, a must have sauce for the chicken. With a little catch-up. The thing about canes They don't serve any other sauce with their food. Because the ketchup and cane sauce together is delicious and supposed to be all you need. Their chicken is moist and crunchy. Their french fries are kind of normal regular crinkle fries and then they have a side of yummy sesame seed greasy bread (I think that they dip the bread in the chicken grease and it is so good!) and and you can get coleslaw.
  
  The point of Raising Cane's was to raise money for the dog Cane but later on the dog died but they kept the business going and it blew up.
  
  Raising Cane's is simple, easy and quick food with only chicken nuggets, french fries, coleslaw and bread being the things they sell. They called her orders boxes. Caniacs. 3 piece. 4 piece. And of course they have the sandwich.
  
  They also have signature iced tea sweet and unsweet and really good lemonade that they sell also. Raising Cane's it's just kind of quick fast and simple. Good sure.

  Startingin the very early 1800s in Louisiana, after the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase, the term ""Creole""beganto take on a more political meaning and identity, especially for those persons of Latinate culture.. In the United States, the words ""LouisianaCreole"" refers to people of any race or mixture there of who are descended from colonial French La Louisiane and colonial Spanish Louisiana. (New Spain)

  Yes! Louisiana is known for their seasoning and their spicy foods. They're Peppers. Interesting Foods. Combinations. Yeah, Popeyes food is Louisiana actually! it's not silly or stupid! ? no and their food is a little spicy to that makes complete sense! You're totally right! I love Popeyes by the way...!

  People on this app forget that this isn't a dating site either... And wanna use the shoutout button to pick up people...
  
  __________
  
  But me.. I feel that the shoutout button is for people to reach out and let themselves be known and seen. People see what they like in their shoutouts or questions then they can follow them.
  
  The shoutout button can be used to.. obviously to shoutout a user, maybe to give appreciation. A reward. Like for example.
  
  ""I wanna give a HUUUGE shoutout to blah blah... @ whoever... for always sending good questions! Having grwat answers! Y'all go and check out their page/account! Give them a follow because they to me are awesome.""
  
  Like that.
  
  Or you can use the shoutout button to send questions. I use it that way. Also to shout people out. Cause some people don't get any questions in a day and if my shoutout can reach their page then I feep that is good.
  
  I remember starting out on this page. I didn't get alot of questions. But once you get out there and make yourself known, you will.
  
  But do remember that the shoutout button is sent to random and the answers will not always be the nicest... And you can't get mad because you semt the question... I don't try to shout people I really like on here to strangers really much... Because usually the shoutout people (the randoms) don't really care anyway. Lol. But that's me telling it how it is off of experience... So yeah I really just stick to sending random questions.

   Is it okay for adults to swear? If it’s not, why doesn’t it seem reprehensible anymore? Should it be reprehensible? If it’s okay, why shouldn’t minors be allowed to swear since it doesn’t seem harmful?

   Is it right for someone to settle for what is less (in exchange for leisure and ease) when they can achieve more?
  ","
  I feep like people should at least everyday regular effort in their day. Try to complete simple and easy tasks. Try their best to complete them at the best of their ability and actually ""try."" But at their own pace maybe...
  
  But if you mean.. Like some people... For instance... In highschool... Are only are doing what they can... just to get by... I mean if that's what they want to do then so be it.. But in my opinion... I think you should do everything in your power to do your very best and try to make a challenge for yourself! Then try your very best to achieve it! Try to make straight A's! If you can't and you are doing your very best. Well then your giving it your all and that is enough. Perfect. Is good. It's the fact that you are trying your best. That's what counts. That can take you a long way in life!
  
  Same with college and work in life. When you are at your career. Give it your all and tey your best to do the best job you can! Be mindful of your limits... And take breaks and celebrate l time to time because if your doing your best and a good job then you deserve it!

  I don't try to but if your pushing it... like as in... if ya keep acting like an ash with/at me... Then ima tell them/ya the truth regularless of your feelings. I am gonna be straight forward.
  
  I don't more or less try to embarrass people? I am more.. just brutally honest with them and try to teach them a lesson. Push/build them up... but sometimes people don't comprehend words... catch hints, so sometimes you have to be straight forward with them... and that could be embarrassing to them... Whether it be on social media... Whether it be in real life or in front of people. People can get embarrassed just with talking to you one on one?... It just depends on how you talk to them. Some people just get offended in general? And it's not even really embarrassment. Sometimes they bring it on themselves. ? But if they want to take it as an embarrassment then go right on ahead... sometimes that's the best way to find out if they're really in the wrong. And sometimes maybe it's getting through to them.
  
  There's not a lot of things that embarrass me anymore. ? lol sooo... Yeah. They gonna have to try a little bit harder with this one.

  Moralsrefer mainly to guiding principles, and ethics refer to specific rules and actions, or behaviors. Amoralprecept is an idea or opinion that's driven by a desire to be good. An ethical code is a set of rules that defines allowable actions or correct behavior.

  Sometimes you have to let go of certain friends. And it's good to make friends. Usually for example when you get out of high school you tend to drift away from your high school friends. But throughout your life as you get older you tend to make new friends. But I guess it just depends on what kind of person you are. I am enjoy making new friends. Some people don't.

Those who are rude/negative are either bored or just complain and find faults in positive/nice ones and never spend time on improving or correcting their own faults and always they have a problem for every solution ??
  ","
  I agree. I explained this almost every single day. At least someone else sees it as well.
  
  People are jealous because they can't seem to find the will to improve themselves. They see us succeeding and so they want to hate on us. I don't care. I'm just going to keep doing me. They want to get angry, they can. Just wish sometimes people would focus on themselves and mind their own business. There is no reason to envy. Better yourself and there will be no reason to.

  My dad has the same issue. I think that I inherited it from him. He found out later on in his life, that he has reeeally bad dyslexia. Him, always having trouble with reading comprehension and spelling. Hand writing. We get frustrated more easily. We have a whole nother way of thinking, explaining and doing certain things.
  
   Me, I was diagnosed with it at a young age. We always wondered who I developed it from. Cause it wasn't my mom. It wasn't my Maw maw or Paw paw. It was my dad. He is always misspelling things and making small mistakes in his typing. He doesn't see the mistakes until after. Even after reviewing. The mistakes are not clear to us. We're reading so fast that our eyes are not seeing the mistakes. Our minds are not able to multitask. Them only being able to focus on one thing at a time. It shows in our handwriting. We're more focused on what we're writing then how we are writing it. Extremely bad/messy hand writing.
   
   But yeah.. I apologize ahead of time if any of you guys see my typing and see small grammar mistakes. It probably drives some of you people insane... but here are words of truth, that I do not mean to do what you see and that I try my best. I go over my work like three times and sometimes I miss it still.
   
   I love you all and I'm sure you guys know what I mean... and I will try my best to do better still! Much love! I am always improving!

  I understand people who are sadly insecure.. Some are trying to improve and are just frustrated. Some aren't even try... Some people don't have any support! I believe in y'all! You guy's can do it! That is understandable...
  
  But getting ugly and bullying others who are successful is not what you do. That kinda sh- confuses people to think they're not doing what they're supposed to be. They are doing just dang fine. Because if your mad at them for no reason? You either have some sort of saddness in your life and you express it through bullying and anger and taking it out on others. Some of it is envy, jealously... Envying is never a good thing. Try improving yourself. Think before you speak. Even be nice to strangers. Someone. No hate.

  It depends. Some people are different. Some people care more than others. But they should care for their friends. Maybe you should show (like talk to them about it) them that you need their support more and if they're not willing to give it then that's an obvious red flag.
  
  Good friends. Especially really close friend should always be willing to support their friends. I want to see my friends happy. I don't want them to be sad. They should support you in the right way though. If something's wrong and they should try to support you to do the right thing.

   Is it bad being unsociable? Why/Why not?
  ","
  Can be. Some people are fine with out it and some people can develop a lot of anxiety, certain conditions and other issues.
  
  Being social is not only  mentally, but physically healthy for both humans and animals. Even an animal can become ill overtime with being unsocial.
  
  Usually you'll see that everyday dog on a chain in the corner of someone's yard and everyone wonders why that dog chases people down and attacks them? because being unsocial can make people crack, go mad. I can. And as I said before. Not everyone. But it can for some in some cases... Makes them develop certain conditions in issues as I said above... it does not allow them to stretch their social skills. And learn think before they speak. It doesn't allow them to build their morals as much as they could. Trying to wisen up and learning morals in life is important.
  
  Getting out and being around people... learning how to deal with certain situations... Learning how to talk to one another and communicate is important for the brain for any living thing.
  
  We're all different. Some people can handle being unsocial and some can't. But in any chance... it's better to be social. You make it farther in life.

  Nah. I'm pretty easy to get along with.
  
  That is for the birds. I ignore all that.
  
  I mind my own business and worry bout' me.
  
  Every now and then I have people that randomly just don't like me. ? lol idky?
  
  People just randomly do that to all. Some people get jealous because some people are getting more attention than them or their succeeding more than them.. or at least it seems like we are getting more ""attention"" or ""are succeeding more.""
  
  I don't look for attention. People just come to me and I don't mind.
  
  I used to be a nobody, but once you start socializing and making sense and being nice people start wanting to talk to ya.
  
  I want to talk to people who are nice and helpful and aren't mean. I think people need to focus on their selves more than others. I think they need to stop getting mad at others for succeeding and try to succeed themselves. Work on them.

   Tell me about the Renaissance festivals.....what are they about and what is their objective?
  ","
  When you go to them they are literally living the time of the Renaissance. They talk, live, cook, play (the kids), work (the adults), party like during that time. It really is awesome. When you go in there and they literally treat you as a person in the Renaissance. So you get that Vibe I really was back in the day. There's hundreds of things you can do. My favorite thing is browsing the shops I'm looking up the armor and weapons. Checking out the homemade leather books homemade leather purses. And then games. Customize buys. Jewelry. Incense. I love doing henna tattoos there. That's where I usually get mine done at. The food is good. I usually get fried Oreos when I go there. Chicken on the stick. Or turkey leg. I usually buy a knife or two. You can also get blown glass and it's so cool. Fortune teller. You can play the back in the day hit the bell games where you take a mallet and you try to hit the bell and what a prize and it's like the real deal. It's really hard to beat.
  
  They playing music. They make old-time instruments sometimes I wish you play them. They have petting zoos and show animals sometimes. Comdy shows and fake battles. Even a hawk show.
  
  The best part about the festival is you can go there and blend in and act and dress like them and join in! That's what they want you to do!
  
  It'd alot of fun really. One of my favorite festivals.
  "

Maybe play some video games and cook something yummy for dinner together or order take out. Or just eat some candy.

As long ad there is no slots. 18 is allowed. No younger tho. Can drink and all. Just have to have someone of the age with you and bar owners allowing. 100%  allowed where I am at. Not many areas allow this. But I would go and get some drinks and chill listening to music and singing karaoke with the other folks and shooting pool and I mean all night... Free food. Some dude with a motorcycle would always pay for my drinks! Lol I remember drinking and just having a good old time. Haha. I don't do that no more tho.

  ______________________
  
  I am tired of people not minding their own business. Not focussing on their sh- instead of other people's sh-
  
  People getting butthurt over things that don't even have to do with them. Pretty much as the 1st thing I said.
  
  I'm tired of people not having the respect and morals for people that others have. Even for strangers! They count!
  
  I'm tired of people blaming objects for why our world is so fuked up.
  
  I'm tired of people blaming other people for why their life is sh-. You did it, so that means it is your problem. Your fault. Get over it. Do better next time.
  
  I am sick and tired of people making this world all about them them them. It is not only about you so gtf over it. We are all here dealing with the same sh ? yeah.. So that's that.
  
  I'm tired of people getting jealous because they see someone else succeeding over them. Then.. They try and make fun of them?! Don't do that? Support them! Tell them good job! Right on! Yeah! Not beat them down?... Then YOU turn around and do the same and try to succeed. Don't try to mess them up. Fuk that. They are doing right and you just in the slow lane. SPEED UP!
  
  People need to learn respect.
  
  Their are certain things you say and you don't. People can say what they want. Yeah. But make sure you remember in backlashes on you too and how you look. If you wanna look stupid, go ahead. But ima keep logical and be me. And that's it? You don't like it. Then move on. Ima sleep the same the next day regularless. Ain't gon' hurt my feelings. It's life. Just wish they'd see the sh- the same. Grow up one day will ya? And stop worrying about everyone's sh- NOW THAT'S what's wrong with this fuking world. Learn it.

  Just make sure you are gentle with your hair.

  Don't wash your hair every single day.
  
  You certain products in your hair that are not hurtful but helpful.
  
  Get your hair trimmed every 3 months barely because you want to keep length but keep it healthy.
  
  The reason why you don't want to wash it every single day is because lice like really clean and really dirty hair. So if you're washing it every single day they're going to be like... hell yeah there is a five-star hotel! And if you don't wash it often enough that they're going to be like ouuu! food! food! and home!
  "
48117,"
   What exactly are they? ?
  ","
  It's an air purifier that takes in bad particles and then kicks out good particles.
  
  They came in and didn't tests and our house and apparently we had like in just one room over 400,000 contaminated particles and we put this on and in 15 mins, it brought it down to only 200 particles? 300? So basically this is like getting a flu shot times 10. So instead of having to go to the doctor all the time this decreases your doctor visits and shots. It pushes out certain particles that fights off contamination and things that make you sick. Less respiratory infections. It also gives off a really good smell makes the air feel really good. Not like dry feeling, tasting.. It also pushes out cold air so it's kind of like a little air conditioner. We have one in each room now.

But really... you should try regardless to keep the friendship inbetween you and any of your family members. But I could see that becoming an issue tho... you kinda branching off from a family member because of certain sistuations. Yeah.. It sadly happens.. It does.. Try to reform that friendship and forget the past. Move forward. Let them know that's what you wanna do. For real. Forget eveverything. And both of you start treating eachother better. When you go to argue. Just understand the other person's views/side. It's okay to disagree... But don't mean ya gotta hate eachother. That's not what disagreeing means to do. No.
