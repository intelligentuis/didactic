Only to be completely ignored. I didn't cheat I simply let go of someone who wasnt worth wasting my time on and MOVED on. There is nothing wrong with that. You can not make a relationship work especially if only one person is doing all the work. He could've told me he was busy or whatever but never did. Half the information I found out by looking at his profiles. Oh and let's also not forget that he's the one who actually cheated ... And blocked me and wouldn't explain why or whatever till months later. Let's remind you how he claimed over and over he loved me but completely fell of the face of the earth for months before I even got a simple hi from him. And then you claimed to love me but then go on to post you lied and are\/is still obsessed with an \"ex \" who is in a relationship and I was like the rebound. I'm sorry but I will not stand to be used, manipulative, lied to, and a rebound for someone who doesn't value me.

It was a complete collaboration between the 6 of us! Everyone wrote lyrics, christina did almost all of the chords and melodies and put the lyrics together and then I  produced it! Dani wrote the first lyrics we used for first verse and chorus and we went from there... and Lisa tweaked a couple melodies after christina had finished the song! And Lisa and christina both wrote the harmonies.  A true collaboration!!\n  \n  Dani was inspired to write believe in you because emmyn her fiance has been struggling with things in his personal life and not seeing his true value and that in life so while she was thinking she was thinking about him and what she sees based on what he does and how she could remind him that she like believes he can fix or imorive things. And then we all kinda tied it in with our own meanings. Because when do we ever tell ourselves that we believe in us? And say positive things. We always let things tear us down or we are our own worst enemy.

I\u2019ve always had an issue with people pleasing and putting others first to the point that I completely forget to take care of myself and my needs. I\u2019ve done a lot of work over the past few years to get over that and I was doing a pretty good job for a while recently but this week I realized that it was coming creeping back in. And I was doing things solely because I didn\u2019t want to upset people and almost every conversation was so exhausting because I was hyper focused on how the person I was talking to was feeling and trying to respond in a way that I thought they wanted me to respond that I was completely losing myself. I\u2019ve been running myself into the freaking ground trying to prove myself to everyone in pretty much every way you can and stressing myself out so much that I ended up getting sick and basically being forced to take a break and take care of myself. All that to say I decided that for this next week I need to protect myself and make sure I have the time I need to relax and decompress and be alone. I don\u2019t have to be there for everyone all the time and neither do you!!!! If you relate to any of that, I really urge you to take a step back, take a breath and start putting your mental and physical health first.

In 2015, my family and I included moved to nashville, Tennessee after a quick decision was made on an opportunity we had to act fast on. We moved miles away from a state, place and city we have lived our entire lives in to a state we were not that familiar with to get a fresh start on life. This means we also left many of our friends, family, and community behind. Getting settled in we knew no one, had no clue were anything was located or places that were popular to go to etc. And it took awhile to get settled in and actually liking things and knowing what's a good plave to even eat at etc. Upon moving I made a few friends months later and started attending a church I liked and many other activities. I met Christian Suray, a guy who went to the same church as I and was in the same youth group etc. And we just talked and becane friends. His family suggested he should take me to prom since he was like the only person I knew at the time and it would help me get to know places a bit better. I agreed to go with him. And later on my sisters kinda heloed him with his proposal as our new album \"hearts on fire \" was recently released at that time. They took photos which were later posted onto instagram for our followers to see and get to witness this moment with me. Fast forward, christian and I are friends and its like november at the time he asks me to be his girlfriend. I agreed. And I keep my relationship very private because I hate when people talk about it. Anyway things were good for awhile then I had to leave for tour and christian was focused on going to college in alabama at the time. So we decided to split even though I have grew pretty attached to him in the first few months of living in Tennessee. That was the only person I truly knew and the only friend I had at the time, so I was heartbroken to know that person was leaving so soon. I went on and continued with my life the best I could, focusing on my career and music. But I quickly fell into a dark place and became unmotivated and not myself. And the only thing that really helped at the time was writing acid rain about christian. It was the only way I could get my feelings out and feel a bit better. Christian ended up posting a video on youtube about his experience at prom with me and told them about us dating and then just being friends (which was made against my consent and was removed later that day). I was just in a dark place, and having fans constantly in my personal life was not helping at all. Eventually my feelings got to much and I started to shut down and break. I cried the first time we ever performed acid rain on stage in boston. Just thinking about everything going on and not being able to fully process my emotions. At the time I had a best friend but he was in love with me and then that added stress because my fans\n  ","924388":"\n  LIL SNIPPET OF OUR NEW SONG \"BELIEVE IN YOU\" WHICH COMES OUT AT MIDNIGHT!!!!\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B4AzDPKHtnD\/?igshid=1m5q2n316kcic\n  \n","924389":"\n  You sure?\n  ","924390":"\n  Pretty much anything\n  ","924391":"\n  Have a good night \ud83d\ude0a\n  ","924392":"\n  Yep\n  ","924393":"\n  Be super ignorant towards me and my views\n  ","924394":"\n  Mostly just pepperoni lol\n  ","924395":"\n  Milk\n  ","924396":"\n  Not really\n  ","924397":"\n  Not over dressed but like under dressed\n  ","924398":"\n  I habe no clue\n  ","924399":"\n  Singer :)\n  ","924400":"\n  I'm learning how to play guitar\n  ","924401":"\n  I keep a limit of 200 so I answer bottom up unless its really important\n  ","924402":"\n  Playing in our hometown the 8th of november\n  ","924403":"\n  Anon\n  ","924404":"\n  202\n  ","924405":"\n  Definitely not\n  ","924406":"\n  Both \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb as long as it's maintained and neat\n  ","924407":"\n  No\n  ","924408":"\n  Normally I just block and delete other times just state the truth\n  ","924409":"\n  I like men\n  ","924410":"\n  Gotta boyfriend\n  ","924411":"\n  Yes\n  ","924412":"\n  Travel the world\n  ","924413":"\n  No thanks\n  ","924414":"\n  We stayed in a wonderful hotel\n  ","924415":"\n  Been playing it since I was a kid\n  ","924416":"\n  Keyboard :)\n  ","924417":"\n  Hello\n  ","924418":"\n  Yeah :)\n  ","924419":"\n  Normally a friends bf or whatever played an extra or their sibling.

They always brought clothes over to try on a couple of days in advance of the event, which was fortunate, because rarely was there anything acceptable to choose from. Everything was too short, cut too low on top, and the shoes were all stiletto heels. How is any of that appropriate for a 10 year old (or any minor, for that matter)?? I told the girls from the start to not be afraid to tell the stylists that they were uncomfortable with clothing like that and that it was off-brand for them, as they had built their huge fan base off of clean covers and good, clean fun. It was a good lesson for my daughters to learn to stand up for themselves and their values, and of course, I was standing right there behind them if anyone were to give them any grief about their stance. The stylists would then return with a new haul of better choices (although sometimes only slightly better), but this scenario happened time and time again, so clearly there was an industry norm or a directive in there somewhere that ran toward the inappropriate, even for minors.\n  \n  When we did our first professional music video with the label, I received an email asking if the older girls would wear something a bit more revealing. I showed the email to my daughters, and they were horrified. They wanted to sell their music on its own merits, not based on showing some skin. We put our foot down, and the outfits finally chosen were ones that my daughters were comfortable with.  \"\n  ","924507":"\n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/FktDDKNrWjk\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","924508":"\n  No lol we kinda just roasted eachother\n  ","924509":"\n  My mom actually wrote about it kinda on her blog and we wrote a song directed towards the label\n  ","924510":"\n  BC we had a 12 hour drive home and I added a few minutes onto that to grab food\n  ","924511":"\n  Wear revealing clothing, color coordinate, music had to be generic and not fun or personal.
