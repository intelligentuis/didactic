but they have no other choice , then yeah , i d lend em money .","796427":"today in dbt group the leader was asking us in what kinds of situations do our emotions fit the facts and we were starting with fear . no one was saying anything so i decided to say what came first to my mind and i basically said when we see a snake we might experience fear and she was all like smiled and said i feel like that s more disgust , and i get how she may not wanna write that specifically down bc not everyone is afraid of snakes and there s not always a reason to be afraid of them though some can be dangerous . but she could have at least accepted my idea as like if we see something that we think might hurt us or that we have a phobia for , we may experience fear . i mean , that does fit the facts bc the fact is , we are afraid of snakes and so when we see one , it makes sense that we might experience fear . the dismissiveness of my suggestion just made me feel like why do i even bother speaking up in group . . . it gives me anxiety anyway and it just feels like the leaders have smth against whatever i have to say a lot of the time like maybe i just need to stay in the background and that annoyed me bc i m trying to work on my anxiety and it s like the world wants to keep giving me reasons on why i should feel uncomfortable . . . i know this is kinda unreasonable bc not everything we say is gonna be accepted , but it gets really frustrating when it feels like the ratio is really uneven . i think for this particular situation i just felt really invalidated afterward . i m sure the leader didn t mean to make me feel that way , but she could have approached everything differently than just humiliating me bc i m scared of snakes . after that , i just kinda tuned out for the rest of group , pretending to listen but really just chilling bc i just felt really frustrated with myself and the group and just life .","796428":"idk about most of all cus i m not good with labeling superlatives
