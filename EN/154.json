Sit and drink coffee and fuck around on the internet with Bubo for like, 30 min. Put Bubo back and turn on lightbox for an hour. Continue fucking around on the computer  and drinking coffee. Eventually light therapy ends and I grab a glass of water, take my meds, and go outside to smoke up. From there the rest of the day is spent in between chores, smoking, playing with Bubo, and relaxing at my desk until like, 5pm when my husband gets home then we fix dinner and watch tv together and then I generally end out my night at my desk again, sometimes painting, sometimes whatever, until bedtime which is early because I take night meds at 7 pm and generally get very tired within an hour of that.\n  ","165574":"\n  If I was single, then it's a possibility.

I started drinking it with milk and sugar and then just milk and now black. I had to work up to the bitterness haha. But now that I like it, I realllllly like it\n  ","165587":"\n  that's really rough, I'm sorry. the only sure fire way to get over someone is to apply lots of time.

Males are more likely to talk than females. She mimics other birds but not people. When her time is finished I may look into a slightly larger breed and try the talking thing over again. I'll probably try for a male next time just because Bubo lays eggs once a year and it's a month that I don't have her support\/emotional services when she's laying on her eggs.

The example I used with the black birds, for instance, I knew that they weren't really there for other people so it wouldn't be something I'd share. The delusions of persecution and stuff was way more believable so sometimes I would try to explain those things to people.

I ended up being schizophrenic so I don't know if that's just how other drugs affect us or if I hallucinate differently than others or what.\n  ","166205":"\n  someone dosed me with LSD when I was 17, in my drink. I had a very bad trip. It was at a party. I crawled away because I thought the smoke hanging in the air was solid and sort of went on a weird, crawling trip through someone's garden and ended up curled up asleep on the front porch.\n  \n  that's my only experience.

He just started whining when I was eating yogurt one day so I let him lick the bowl and now if he hears the foil top come off of a yogurt cup, he comes running. He doesn't finish vanilla or any creamy flavors but he will get every last drop of most fruit flavors especially strawberry.

By my senior year I was feeling like I was on top of the world. I had good friends and the respect of my peers. College was more of the same, both high school (and all of my schooling) and college were art specific so I was like queen of the artsy kids.
