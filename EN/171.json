sheep while they re still alive then yeah that s torture . it would be for any animal . if you re talking about shaving sheep wool from their body then no , that s just a haircut and doesn t hurt the sheep just like it doesn t hurt people .","158208":"yes and i m not interested in that .","158209":"pigs are cute animals yeah","158210":"yes","158211":"no","158212":"disagree entirely . horse s hooves are made of keratin , the same material your fingernails are made of . they can t feel it , just like you can t feel when you cut your nails . horseshoes are also applied and custom fitted by a skilled craftsmen called a farrier . they have to go to school and attend lots of training to be able to practice that profession so they know exactly how to avoid hurting the horse in any way .","158213":"please don t address me that way . i don t know you and i find that very creepy .","158214":"neither is stupid . you re literally just a hater who seems to dislike everything

can t even afford to give students tissues and pencil crayons","158223":"yesss . people have already asked me this twice","158224":"if you could get money easily then hell yeah , but you won t value it . if you have to work hard for it , it ll make you a more grateful person with a better understanding of the value of things like money and time","158225":"no . . . ? honestly i think this question is pretty stupid . i have no idea what would make an office temp or student or especially a part time employee any less intelligent than a full time employee . going into a position and not knowing everything or needing a bit of training is both very common and just fine . that doesn t make anyone incompetent .","158226":"not very often . it s bad for them to eat too much people food . he gets to lick the plate of sauce and stuff every once in a while but not eat whole meals of human food . he sticks to a diet of dog chow","158227":"let things go . revenge benefits no one","158228":"yeah in

animals","158236":"usually ways that men made us feel uncomfortable during the night , collaborative strategies to mitigate contact with those people , maybe some gossip , or just casual small talk if nothings gone wrong and everyone is having a good time . ladies typically go to the restroom in groups because it can be dangerous to leave a fellow female friend unattended or separated from the group . especially in a crowded area like bars or clubs where alcohol is being served .","158237":"idrk what you really mean by that , but if you re insinuating that they were drugged in any way you re mistaken . that pic was taken after a a workout . everyone was a bit tired at that point lol . dallas right was ready for a nap","158238":"nice !","158239":"i like cranberry juice , apple juice ,

really not interested in talking about the sex lives of any minors or anyone in general . that s not my business and i m not interested in knowing anything about it . if you have concerns please speak

has always been my happy place animals , especially horses , always warm my heart and make me feel calm and collected !","158246":"no , i don t care what other girls do and i m not here to label anyone as anything . that s their own business and if that s a situation that works for them then good for them . it s not hurting me so imma stay in my own lane fr","158247":"dude . . . look , i don t know you . . . i m sorry that bad things happened to you , no one deserves that at all , but i cannot be your therapist . please seek counseling from someone who knows how to truly listen and help you . dumping your emotional baggage on random internet users you don t even know is extremely unhealthy you deserve to actually process your emotions and feel better ! i m just really not the best person to help guide you there , i m sorry","158248":"i haven t been triggered by any anon questions today lol . not sure which q you re talking about","158249":"servers depend on tips for their income . the only time i wouldn t tip a server is if i literally watched them spit in my food or they were extremely rude condescending to me . service being slow isn t typically the waitstaff s fault . sometimes it s busy and they re stretched thin , i get that man . no worries .","158250":"i literally just told you no . not sure what s so difficult to understand about that . i ve been kind and polite to you about this same exact subject or times and i ve gently explained how that makes me uncomfortable . i will not be telling you again . if you want to be private then remain on anonymous on ask . fm . anonymous questions are untraceable and nobody knows who asks them","158251":"not too often for me , but my sister is really big on using doordash and uber eats and stuff like that . she has things delivered to the house a lot so she doesn t have to go out bc of covid","158252":"um ok then . . .","158253":"ok dude then just talk to me . just know that i still don t wanna be dm d on any social medias , i don t wanna see pics of people who you don t like or screenshots of drama whatever , i cannot be your therapist , and i literally can t make you feel happy . but , seriously , if you wanna actually talk about something you re interested in then ask me on ask . fm and let s have a nice convo lol !","158254":"it wasn t this is most likely from the same anon who keeps trying to tell me i m a maga supporter , paint me as a racist , and push me to get angry and say something unkind in my replies . it won t work . leave me alone already , you re not being funny or cute or quirky . i don t need to justify why i m not a hateful person to a random anonymous user on the internet .","158255":"you think everything is stupid . . . . also yeah i learned in france . it s very commonplace there","158256":"go do something lol","158257":"disagree on the grounds that you have to want to actually start to help yourself and books are a great way to begin . getting yourself up and moving enough to to just go get the hook is even helpful . i see your point i just think it s dumb .","158258":"uhh . . . what does this mean ? am i supposed to pick what i d rather have or am i supposed to tell you my favorite food and drink ?","158259":"i don t like scary movies or horror genre characters","158260":"fine . hope you re doing well","158261":"idk . depends on your definition i guess but most comedians who are actually funny have to be extremely clever . to me clowns are supposed to be funny because they re silly , use cheap tricks , act dumb , and slapstick humor but good comedians are funny because they re quippy , intelligent , and make you think","158262":"constructive criticisms help us to learn and grow . the same can t be said for negative or hateful remarks , that s where the word criticism gets many of its negative connotations from . but not all criticism is bad .","158263":"i don t know how else to tell you no . . . this will be the th time now . i don t specifically follow any religion or adhere strictly to any of their teachings . that doesn t mean i don t think some of those teachings are valuable and worth incorporating into my life , but i don t subscribe to any one religion .","158264":"bro i just said that . . . .","158265":"i just told you i didn t practice any religion , so in my own personal life , it wouldn t make a difference . that may not be true for others , and that s their own choice and right to believe , but i don t subscribe to it .","158266":"there is historical evidence that jesus was a real person who actually existed , and many consider him to be a prophet of god . i don t discount the important lessons taught in many of the holy scriptures , but i can neither confirm nor deny that there is a greater power or creator involved .","158267":"yes","158268":"i live non religiously but was raised in a catholic protestant mixed household","158269":"hahaha ikr","158270":"why do you keep yelling at me about this . . . ? seems like you re the one who s a bit hung up on supporting trump you just want to spark a reaction , but it won t work . go away .","158271":"crow !","158272":"president donald

pasture board so he can exercise or not lol whenever he feels like it","158277":"no , he s extremely used to all sorts of loud noises happening around him . he s been trained to be used to traffic sounds , kids , dogs , lawnmowers , and commotion . he s generally very safe and tolerant he s very bombproof lol . basically that means nothing that normally bothers other horses really bothers or scares him .","158278":"the subjects of whips and crops tends to become a complicated one if people don t understand what their intended purpose is . whips , crops , bats , whatever you prefer to call them , are only used as attention getters and behavior reinforcers . you should never tap your horse with the whip hard enough for it to hurt them , and also only in key areas . they re meant to be used only as a reinforcing aid to your other aids voice , legs , hands , and seat . that being said , with the horse i m working with now , i very rarely need to use a crop while riding and have never actually had to tap him with it . holding the crop in my hand and allowing him to see it has been sufficient in encouraging him to stretch down and move forward .","158279":"his name is chance and he belongs to my boyfriend actually","158280":"no i ve also answered this question multiple times . . . stop asking . idk why i would even want to do that . i don t like throwing up or feeling too full .","158281":"he s doing fine thanks it s been pretty rainy and foggy lately , so he s been a bit damp but that means his spots come out more !","158282":"after yall ve been just asking about weird sex stuff involving lipstick shades , i won t be answering this one","158283":"go away asshole . i already told you i m not into your kicking fetish and don t want to contribute to your nasty jerk off

doing well ! when i call sandy he always makes sure i get to see the horse too bc he knows it makes me super happy since i can t be there rn . it s so cute he does it every morning and evening before

even approach a wild horse in most places and a very very bad and dangerous idea at best in places where it isn t outright illegal . however , there are both private and governmental organizations that facilitate the adoption of wild horses during certain times of year from blm lands and refuges . you can tame and train those horses if your application for adoption is accepted","158340":"true true","158341":"you can find horses at auctions for nearly free , but there s no guarantee they ll be trained or safe to handle . a decently started or well trained horse usually goes from around , s for a low to mid level horse to the upper , s for a professional or olympic level trained horse","158342":"tongue . more easily hidable than another nose lol","158343":"depends on my mood lol . anything but hershey s","158344":"no , they eat a lot more fibrous and abrasive food than non feral horses so they wear their teeth down a lot more , making them not as likely to become sharp . all horses are hypsodonts , meaning their teeth are both really long and they continuously erupt out of their gums as the wear down from chewing . feral horses also eat a less sugar than non feral horses because they have less access to it . ie nobody to feed them peppermint treats , apples , or sugar cubes","158345":"that s happened to me before too . totally the worst . glad you re seeming to feel better now tho","158346":"milk chocolate","158347":"good for you ! aw yeah that happened to my bf last month and his boss had to send him home early too . he felt sick and could t eat or anything i

would never stop staring at you if you had an extra eye on your face","158350":"noice","158351":"hey asshat how would you feel opening your inbox and seeing some condescending idiot trying to ask some stupid ass irrelevant questions bc people apply for jobs they don t have prior experience on all the time because that s how you move up in the world and why would you just keep applying for the same job you already have ?","158352":"i m neither vegan nor vegetarian and agree that people are meant to have a certain amount of protein in their diets that can most easily be acquired from animals , but i also have friends who are vegan and they re able to maintain a balanced diet with no deficiencies , so it s totally doable for sure . to address your second point , the animals used for animal product production are killed for meat anyways after they re deemed unusable so it s not a good compromise . for example cows who can t produce milk anymore after about years of constant pregnancy and milking are slaughtered for beef and chickens who get burnt out on laying eggs around or years are killed as well . even if you , yourself aren t eating meat , you re still directly supporting the machine that pumps animals through it to produce meat . meatless monday s and stuff is a noble cause , and technically that s helping lessen the impact . but don t go into it thinking that that s going to save animals in the future . basically if your reason to change your lifestyle is to save the animals then go all the way or don t go at all lol","158353":"fine thanks","158354":"looks like

water and feed buckets , pitchforks , riding equipment , etc , then it shouldn t be more than an average car payment per month like . around total a year in feed , board , farrier , vet , and dentist","158362":"base concept not stupid at all . actually a good idea ! humans are actually meant to eat a mostly plant based diet anyways ! if you don t have to kill something , then don t . that s not stupid at all . my objections if someone believes killing or harming animals to feed yourself is wrong then fine . . . but if you became a vegetarian for that specific reason , just to save animals from harm or suffering , then why would you continue to support the animal farming industry by continuing to consume animal products ? that s my gripe with a lot of vegetarians who claim they became vegetarian for the animals because they believe killing is wrong . okay but what about milk , eggs , cheese , etc ? those are considered vegetarian because they re not meat products , but the production of all those things still brought harm and suffering to animals . to me it just sounds like half assed veganism and honestly seems extremely hypocritical . either go vegan or don t

look up to is very toxic . that s not a healthy relationship model to base your own beliefs about your future relationships on and that seems to show in your answers . i was spanked twice in my whole life and it did nothing to make me reconsider my actions and only served to spark the same fear in me as you described it did with you . my parents actually recently told me that they felt bad for losing their tempers and spanking me those times because they saw that it only made me pull away from them more and cause a rift in our relationship . i get that parents can t be your friend all the time and they have to lay down the law sometimes but physical violence is never called for and only puts the idea in kids heads that that s an acceptable reaction to dealing with different opinions , making mistakes , or becoming overwhelmed . still no offense or hate or anything . that s just my objective , outsider s opinion , as someone who knows nothing about you or your family

m glad that you re in a better place . we all deserve happiness and safety !","158536":"the two people would first have to make sure they were in the correct position and not sitting too far forward or back on the horse s back to make sure it was safe , but also it would greatly depend on the size weight of both the horse and the combined weight of the people . all horses have weight limits for things they can carry that can t be exceeded , otherwise they risk injury . a general rule i was taught is if you or the weight of the people weigh more than of your horse s entire body , then you re too heavy to ride that horse . for example an average horse weighs lbs , so the animal cannot safely carry a rider s equipment of more than lbs without risk of serious injury","158537":"no offense ,

faithful ! ! !","158543":"gender makes no difference","158544":"great question ! if you re a balanced rider who maintains proper body position while balancing your own weight over the horse s th thoracic vertebra , allowing your weight to be supported on their latissimus dorsi by your thighs , dropping your weight down through your calves to your heels , you won t hurt the horse at all ! that s because this position aligns the rider s center of gravity with the horse s center of gravity , therefore making it easier to carry you . it also puts the most weight on their supporting back muscles the lats which are very strong . when riding in a saddle , in order not to cause the horse discomfort , you should still maintain correct body position as well as having the saddle placed between t and t , so as not to put any weight on the floating ribs or hinder the shoulder blade movement . if you re unbalanced and flop around on their back then no matter if you have a saddle or not you could potentially make them uncomfortable or eventually injure them after repeated rides . here s an infographic i created showcasing correct and incorrect rider position !","158545":"be rude or

have to drive to campus early in the morning to make it to class on time , i can just stay in my pj s and turn in my computer lol","158565":"not particularly haha . today s been a day of cleaning the house and organizing things a bit . done some work for my online class and planned what i want to wear to my friend s upcoming wedding ! how s your work been ?","158566":"hi , i m doing well thanks .

from like years ago but here you go anyways","158569":"thank you for understanding ! if you didn t want to cause me to feel frustrated though then maybe try listening the first time . telling someone to relax after you ve been pushy and tested their patience is very irritating .","158570":"do your eyes not work very well ? i just told you no . that doesn t mean ask again , it means no thank you . i m trying to be polite to you and i m sure whatever you want to say is important and i d like to hear it , but that s my final answer on the subject .","158571":"ew fuck off","158572":"i answer all the questions i receive that aren t inappropriate sometimes when i m answering q a from my inbox they randomly disappear without me answering or deleting them though so i m sorry if that happened and i didn t answer you !","158573":"no thank you i m uncomfortable with having random people i don t know in my dm s . if you have something to say i d love to hear it on ask ! i m sure you

mine","158577":"i have one , yeah","158578":"true lol . you know , surprisingly i m not a big fan of horse racing . there s a lot of things that go on behind the scenes at racetracks that i don t care for and find very cruel . i m also not a particular fan of a lot of the physical ramifications that racing has on horses bodies , even if they re actually treated fairly by their owners . there are also alot of people in the racing industry that are in it more for the money than for the love of the sport and , therefore , end up treating their animals only like numbers and money making machines and don t care about their wellbeing . lots of horses who aren t considered winners are treated poorly and cast aside or sold off to kill pens to await slaughter to become dog food","158579":"apparently my name means victory of the people","158580":"oh awesome i ll follow you back","158581":"hah yeaaaah a bit tough to learn at first ngl , but so worth it ! and honestly anyone can learn to ride relatively quickly if you have good instruction and a calm , experienced , horse to learn on . horses are basically like big tiptoe y dogs most are very sweet and willing to be calm and friendly to you and won t get upset if you do something wrong while riding or handling them . especially a lot of horses owned by riding schools . they re usually pretty used to being used for teaching beginner riders the basics and are pretty slow and steady","158582":"yeah it kinda sucks to fall off but it s just another mental hurdle you gotta overcome . the tighter you are with your body and the more you squeeze and get nervous , the more likely you are to fall . it s so weird but if you pretty much ignore every natural instinct your body tells you to do like leaning forward , or squeezing , or looking down , then you ll actually have a much easier and safer experience","158583":"a little over a year","158584":"awe thanks ! the grey is chance and the chestnut is nugget lol . if you ever get the opportunity to try horse riding you totally should though ! its so fun ! ! and it s more difficult than people think tbh . you definitely gotta do more than just sit there p","158585":"aw you ll fund your someone !","158586":"hello","158587":"when i was years old my mom signed me up to try riding lessons at a local barn bc i was having trouble fitting in when we had to move to germany . even though we ve moved back to the us i ve still stuck with it and i ve loved it ever since !","158588":"hahaha p","158589":"yeah ! i found my passion and i m sticking to it that s not to say i won t try new things , but i definitely know where my heart lies","158590":"haha that s very flattering p","158591":"other than equestrian , no . i generally don t like sports that involve a ball , so that rules out a lot lol","158592":"no , that s literally illegal . they re a minor and honestly they re in a vastly different part of their life than i am and i don t think we would even see the world in the same light even if we did share a few opinions . at i was a different person than i am now , a less mature version of myself .","158593":"it was hard work but i loved

working with horses teaches you a lot about yourself and helps you grow , gives you a sense of responsibility , brings people together over a common interest , automatic fluffy friend and partner to hang out with , chilling with them is good to help you relax , horses are great listeners and awesome secret keepers , it s super fun to ride , lots of different sub categories of equine sports so there s something for everyone , they re soft and gentle like big doggies if you re friends with them , they re so pretty and make great models cons hard work and dedication to keep them in shape for riding especially if you want to compete , health bills like farrier dentist vet feed bills can be expensive , sucks up a lot of your free time if you re their only caretaker , they need to live with a friend like another horse or even a dog or goats so you have to have more than one animal otherwise they can legit die of loneliness , horses are high key accident prone and will find new and interesting ways to accidentally hurt themselves","158622":"nooooo haha i don t need that shit in my life . i ve already had enough paranormal experiences thankyouverymuch","158623":"that was nice , she has a good voice . she seems to actually know how to ride a horse too so that made me happy that she was kind to the horse in her video that she was riding","158624":"hey","158625":"yeah ! i think horses are more intelligent than some people give them credit for . not as smart as a dog maybe since that s not what we initially bred them for but similar to dogs they have good memories and can learn words and tricks and remember their people i read somewhere that they can also distinguish between different human emotions , like they know an angry human from a happy human and can react accordingly","158626":"idk who that is sorry","158627":"no i m not interested in what famous people are doing i don t understand the appeal","158628":"i don t like to be

animals and dinosaur figures that i loved !","158655":"horse riding lol . here s my lovely student practicing his eq and steering skills on the lungeline","158656":"it gives me a sense of well being

at the same place for a while","158658":"anything you decide to do while drunk is never as good of an idea as you initially think it is lol","158659":"dad bc he s much more quiet and

guess","158674":"sandy is the only creature for me","158675":"why ?","158676":"eh idk . whatever i felt like at the time i guess .","158677":"chemistry class","158678":"no i just have google translate lol . i can actually speak some german tho","158679":"hmmm not sure . i don t really have any closeted music taste lol","158680":"i try to be very careful about not putting my personal info like bank number or address or phone number on the internet . for safety reasons of course !","158681":"i always miss sandman when he s gone","158682":"probably like lol . my little screentime calculator app says i spend around hrs a day on my phone but not sure how much of that is actually online vs just using gps or spotify . unless you count using those as being online since pretty much everything needs internet connection nowadays","158683":"gracias ! igualmente !","158684":"oh good , thank goodness lol","158685":"my good luck necklace","158686":"dang i haven t listened to her in a while . . . actually i don t think i m really a fan of a lot of those . price tag is catchy but tbh i find a lot of pop and pop influenced music a little irritating hope i m not offending ! !","158687":"eh she s not on my top faves list but her music isn t bad . i can t say i know any of her songs off the top of my head though","158688":"my thumbs are double jointed lol . idk if that s a talent per say but it is pretty useless","158689":"not really . if we all follow social distancing guidelines , limit pointless outings , wear masks , and wash our hands more often , we should be fine .","158690":"in the sense that i like to surround myself with positive people . if someone is too negative all the time or is mean i try not to become too close with them","158691":"a hug from a loved one , petting my dog , or riding a horse !","158692":"october because of spoopy szn and fall colors and cool weather","158693":"in the most non poetic way possible , there s an ass for every seat . everyone can find love !","158694":"neither really . if i m famous for something though i wish it could be for my youtube content","158695":"sandy or my parents depending on what it is . personal advice questions go to sandy , life advice questions go to the rents","158696":"love ! you ve gotta kids a lot of frogs before you find your prince","158697":"furniture ! then i could make all my own furniture and also sell it there s good money in that !","158698":"yeah , especially when i was younger and had more time for it ! this pic is from one of the last ones i competed in before corona hit . horse s name is nugget","158699":"i was a pretty quiet kid apparently but my sister was a really loud crier . my parents were always pretty tolerant though bc she had problems with her ears so that s why she cried","158700":"you don t like kids either ?","158701":"i don t like kids or babies . they re too loud and messy and irritating . people always say oh you ll change your mind one day but honestly i ve thought that since i myself was a kid lol","158702":"mexican","158703":"picking up dog poo on walks but i do it anyways","158704":"plug in my phone","158705":"different strokes for for different folks i reckon . doesn t matter to me anyways , i really don t want kids lol","158706":"lmao that s insanity . seems you and i differ in our ideas of efficient parenting methods","158707":"haha or you end up becoming more oppositionally defiant p","158708":"hey","158709":"pisces","158710":"long legs !","158711":"whisper","158712":"don t think that has anything to do with my parents punishing me or not lol . i ve always been a quiet sort of person and it s always made me super uncomfortable to be rude or loud or pushy to other people . i know what it feels like when others are rude and aggressive toward me and it feels gross so that s not the vibe i want to emit into the world . it seems like we already have enough of that negative energy out there already","158713":"bar soap bc it s less plastic waste you gotta deal with and you can use every last bit of the soap easier that way like none gets stuck in the bottom of the container and you can t get it out","158714":"either have a serious convo or just dump ur gf cause that s huge a red flag and is ridiculous behavior . if your boss isn t making moves on you or being inappropriate toward you who cares what they look like and what does that even have to do with your relationship ? just my opinion","158715":"no not really . i m not really interested in cars and they re too loud and annoying sounding haha . some people love the sound of a loud engine but i find it really harsh and abrasive","158716":"mindless , happy , entertainment like futurama or parks and rec","158717":"yeah it s good","158718":"sandy type","158719":"yup","158720":"why do you want to know","158721":"love","158722":"so true","158723":"true true , mornings can be pretty cool i ve always remembered just gritting my teeth and bearing it until i actually get moving . then i ll be dying of heat trying to get greenies to balance or lazy lesson ponies to wake up","158724":"idk you , your life situation , your goals , your current financial status , your family history , literally anything about you . . . idk how you expected me to respond","158725":"that s something you have to decide for yourself","158726":"oh haha gotcha yeah it doesn t tend to get anywhere near below freezing where i live and the summers are always ungodly hot so i don t usually need to dress super warm any time of the year . it hasn t even snowed here in years ! typically end up with cold rainy days or hot and humid days","158727":"not really sure why you re so curious persistent . . . but like i wasn t allowed piercings or hair dye or anything , i wasn t allowed to wear any clothing to school that wasn t approved by my mom , i wasn t allowed to eat certain foods my mom didn t like , i couldn t have my phone in my room after a certain time of night , couldn t hang out with people my parents didn t know and approve of , that sort of stuff .","158728":"yeah you could totally wear thermal leggings under your breeches if you wanted , i just don t own any . regular leggings have worked really well for me and they re cheaper so i don t see the need p if you re sitting around a lot , like if you re on the sidelines at a show or something or in the warmup ring , then i usually have on pajama pants over my breeches too so i don t get dirt on them and it s also slightly warmer . if i m just sitting there in the stands waiting my turn or cheering on my team then i tend to layer up in human blankets and quarter sheets . . . basically anything that s on hand at the time . i like blankets better than more layers of clothes cause it s honestly just way more convenient . they re just easier to take on and off while wearing a riding helmet cause you don t have to put them over your head like a hoodie or something . if you did want another jacket then things with zippers are your friend ! any extra jackets i d consider wearing would need to have a zipper . nothing more annoying than having to take off your helmet to remove or put on layers of clothes after you finally got all your hair to fit in it without making you look like a mushroom head long hair probs lol even when i m doing barn chores i don t tend to layer up too too much unless it s extremely cold . it s pretty difficult to move around a lot in heavy layers of clothing when you don t need them . plus i always end up getting too hot and sweaty if i have too many layers . farm chores can be tough physical work lol . as long as i keep moving i m usually not cold . just btw , why do you ask ?","158729":"yeah they re related pretty closely ! zebras are in the same family , equidae , and are also part of the same genus equus . even though they re closely related they aren t the same species though ie zebras aren t just stripey little horses , they re their own separate thing","158730":"pretty strict with some things but not so much with others . overall they probably could ve lightened up a bit but they weren t too bad .","158731":"lol p","158732":"i m an adult so i don t really have to listen to my parents rules and stuff that much . if i m respectful they don t get upset with me and don t act strict like they used to when i was in high school and grade school","158733":"it would be easier to be a sociable idiot because you wouldn t know how dumb you were . ignorance is bliss in that situation","158734":"haven t really been browsing the internet . i ve been in class","158735":"yeah , i don t like change but i can accept it quickly . growing up as a military child taught me to more easily adapt to new environments and quickly become a chameleon","158736":"no i tried meds for a while but i didn t like the way they made me feel so now i m off them . that was a long time ago . instead now i m meditating , going outside more , and trying to remove toxic and stressful people from my life . it s working for me really well and i haven t felt sad like i used to in a while","158737":"neither yes or no . i m not interested in answering questions like that . think whatever you want","158738":"this is a vulgar question i m not interested in answering . don t be gross .","158739":"no socks","158740":"i m not interested in answering questions like this","158741":"i m not interested in sharing any inappropriate or personal details of my life","158742":"lmao won t be different for me","158743":"i shave my legs and stuff","158744":"not really interested in showing off my body to ask . this page is about horses . scroll down and look at the pics i ve already posted","158745":"california roll ngl i m not a seasoned sushi connoisseur","158746":"teeth and smile and eyes","158747":"yeah i ve fought clinical depression for a long time","158748":"no , more scared of the unknown .","158749":"okay that s great and all lol but still not here for it","158750":"oh haha no worries ! yeah there are lots and lots of breeds of horses ! and cross breeds too that became their own thing like this boy , chance ! he s an arabian cross","158751":"it s weird , dude . that s not what this page is about . i m not interested in showing off my body for randos on the internet . im just here to talk about horses and equestrian sports and answer a few other questions along the way","158752":"i don t have a leggings drawer and even if i did i would never post that on the internet","158753":"move on and don t think about your ex . do things that make you happy and do them for no one but yourself . don t post all over social media about the breakup and don t look at old pictures . don t hide your emotions from yourself and push them away . process what happened , allow yourself to be sad , analyze the situation , and grow from it . just try to be happy and focus on yourself , otherwise you ll take a long time to heal and be bitter","158754":"veterinarian","158755":"yeah for sure ! as the oldest child i was the guinea pig lol . my parents learned a lot from raising me for a while first , so a lot of things my parents did for me they did differently for my little sister . she was allowed to do a lot of things i wasn t allowed to do , have things very early on that i had to fight to be allowed to have , go places on her own and be more independent at an earlier age where i wasn t allowed to until i was much older , things like that . my parents basically calmed down a little and were a little less strict with my younger sister than they were with me","158756":"you mean like personality types or breeds ? actually , yes to both of those things !","158757":"nah . money can solve lots of problems many people have but honestly it isn t something that can make you happy . that s something you have to find within yourself . sounds cliche but honestly you have to decide to be happy and try hard at it !","158758":"they re kind of like dogs ! they each have different personalities and opinions but they re very willing and trusting animals if you know how to approach training each different personality type . they re smarter than most people give them credit for i think","158759":"currently don t own any of my own at this point in time . just not financially viable for me rn . i work with other people s horses for them instead","158760":"sandy and i went to a cute little beer garden with the dog . ordered some fries and had a drink . it made me really happy to spend time with him and do an activity that was out of our usual routine","158761":"nothing much","158762":"hi","158763":"nope just normal black leggings like you get from walmart ! and that s only when it s really cold outside . i have a few pairs of thicker winter riding pants i wear instead when it s not below freezing","158764":"yeah of course . broke my wrist that way once","158765":"immersion therapy but meh","158766":"well , you re working out and moving a lot so you tend to heat up and sweat a fair amount . i usually end up taking off a jacket layer once we get going","158767":"no","158768":"definitely","158769":"countryside","158770":"sandy says that one time we rode chance through the town of farmvegas and we had all the frats bumpin","158771":"haha saying no is super easy for me","158772":"other than my regular undergarments and riding pants , i usually put on some leggings under my riding pants , warm socks , an under armor shirt , a fleece jacket , and an overcoat","158773":"yeah","158774":"no , never . there s literally no point in that .","158775":"unless we re in a super loud room then every time","158776":"europe !","158777":"rainy days are great if you have a friend to share them with","158778":"ambition","158779":"nope","158780":"go swimming !","158781":"take a step back , take a breath , reassess , maybe talk about my

them before once had to help my friend use the restroom bc she was so drunk and couldn t sit up straight . i put her to bed right after that lol she was gooooone","158826":"haha no when people are creepy enough to ask i give them a fake or a rejection hotline number . it s dangerous to give out your real number especially to strangers who could spread it around online","158827":"earth

other horrible disgusting bs i don t want to hear . i try to just ignore the creeps tbh they re not worth time or energy","158829":"i m not really sure tbh . it has a lot to do with your personal body chemistry , bmi , overall health , diet , and exercise plan ! i m no dietitian or health expert over here lol . i m not really sure how actually attainable that ll be bc i don t know you personally . . . that s a lot of weight off in a short period of time which seems like it could potentially be quite unhealthy . good luck to you though and please stay safe out there ! !","158830":"haha i guess

laying down","158849":"no , but i added different ones to the photo gallery","158850":"yes . i boycott these companies because they extensively test beauty products on animals and i don t like that . i d rather just buy cosmetics that are cruelty free since that s an option and the cruelty free makeup is just as good .","158851":"she does graphic design and i like to digitally paint and traditionally sketch . thanks , that s very flattering i think i ve posted a few of my sketchbook pages and paintings on here before but none of her work . . . it s not my place to otherwise i would ! she s pretty good !","158852":"no that s fine to say and thanks . she doesn t ride horses but she likes to do art like me","158853":"yeah , that s my friend alesa","158854":"which one ?","158855":"not sure what your carriage driver was talking about . walking is usually fine , but moving at a trot or canter on cobblestones like running on any hard surface like pavement or cement are tough on a horse s hooves , ligaments , tendons , and joints because the surface isn t as soft or forgiving as grass or dirt . you could compare it to human athletes running barefoot on a road or sidewalk . it s doable , but pretty uncomfortable and if you do it a lot you re going to eventually get foot , ankle , tendon , and knee injuries . not to mention cobblestone can also get pretty slippery when it gets wet so it s even more dangerous for horses to move quickly over it in inclement weather","158856":"tf is this ?","158857":"no worries ! horses are my passion so fo for it ! always down to discuss horse related stuff as much as you want !","158858":"yeah that has nothing to do with sleeping but you re mostly right about the function and placement on their body . you were right , it is called the frog and it has less to do with shooting blood back up the leg and more to do with acting as a shock absorber when they bear weight on their hooves while in motion . looks like this in the yellow marked area","158859":"yeah they lay down every day for around min at a time a few times a day to get deep rem sleep . the rest of their sleep cycle is spend standing up and locking their knees so they don t fall over . they do this by using a special system of joints and ligaments in their legs called the stay apparatus","158860":"i have a boyfriend already","158861":"i m not that cool here s a competition pic of me and my old lease horse , sally","158862":"no to both . revenge doesn t help you heal , it only serves to hurt you and others in the future","158863":"once did a bikini car wash in college to raise money for our equestrian team lol","158864":"i don t have any pet goats","158865":"don t be disgusting , you weird , creepy , pervert","158866":"i m not your maid","158867":"i don t live anywhere close to there","158868":"i don t own any goats and i m not feeding any animal something that s a known toxin to them . that s dumb .","158869":"stallions are no more powerful than geldings or mares of their same approximate size and weight . purposely getting kicked by any horse is incredibly stupid idea . . . wouldn t recommend that","158870":"it would take an average sized horse eating over apples at once for the level of arsenic to build up enough to be deadly . the horse would definitely be full way before that point lol . on a similar note though , feeding horses too many apples can cause them to colic which can lead to death . apples are a good treat every once in a while but definitely not an every day thing","158871":"i ve been kicked more than a few times and it sucks but luckily nothing too too terrible has happened as a result . guess it depends on where they kick you but you could get seriously injured if you re standing in the wrong place at the wrong time","158872":"if they receive proper training and are carefully and humanely desensitized to loud sounds then no they shouldn t spook at traffic noises . it s most definitely possible to train horses to not think loud noises are scary like how they can train police horses to ignore car honking , rioters , explosions , and gunfire for working in the city","158873":"not really haha but sometimes","158874":"because alcohol is incredibly bad for dogs and they don t process it as easily or quickly as humans so he was most likely feeling the effects . don t ever feed your dog alcohol dude wtf that s irresponsible and cruel","158875":"horses are smarter than we often give them credit for . they have good memories and can learn tricks , words , and behaviors just like dogs can . long answer short horses aren t as smart as people but smarter than lots of other farm animals like cows or goats","158876":"hours usually . depends on what i have to do the next day and if i can get myself to go to sleep at a decent hour lol","158877":"depends on their work load but usually they get grain one time a day and hay or grass to eat all throughout the day . they don t really ever stop eating except to sleep or exercise . if they don t eat for a long period of time it s really bad for their digestive system","158878":"ugh none","158879":", idiot","158880":"while it s technically legal to do so i don t see the point . the only reason i could ever see someone wanting to do that would be to make their horses better athletes for competition and it s regulation that any horses competing in any sort of fei sanctioned event are drug tested and won t be allowed to compete if drugs are detected in their bodies","158881":"no that s kinda weird","158882":"um no tf ?","158883":"yeah it s not a big deal . it s just a part of being around horses , they eat a lot so they shit a lot","158884":"to the pool and to the beach yeah but i was also def wearing bathing suit bottoms too lol","158885":"yes i d be mad . don t fuckin touch me in public ever . don t even touch me with a pie lmao","158886":"yeah , bras can be uncomfortable af","158887":"i don t have children","158888":"lol okay","158889":"idk dude . i just told you my answer . i d find something that made it so i didn t have to touch the bug when i smashed it and use that thing to smash it","158890":"probably without even realizing haha","158891":"no lol not really . if that happens then that sucks but i m usually pretty careful about where i m stepping and i try to look out for them","158892":"yeah like every day lol","158893":"fine hope you re doing well too","158894":"if you want to talk to me then that s cool , let s talk back and forth over ask i just don t get why you ask the same questions every day and then just say hey xxxxx hey xxx hey xxxx for all the other w s you send lol","158895":"answer the things i just asked you lol . i just asked you questions

i ve heard","158962":"the vet s office got a new doc and she said even though he cried for mamma the whole time he was so brave and stood still to let her do everything she needed to do very quickly

with sandy took my dog to the vet for his follow up appointment to get his booster shots and he was a v good boy","158966":"probably but it would all depend on what your starting weight was . losing

dirty and covered in layers of other kid s sweat , the activities were pointless beyond belief we had a whole dance unit where they made us learn the chicken dance and chacha slide and an entire bowling unit . . . , it was a huge source of stress having to change in the locker room in front of others , i hated smelling bad for the rest of the day , the pe clothes were unflattering and uncomfortable as hell , and the guys in the class always took the opportunity to harass the girls and try to show off . it was a nightmare and i m not sure what the point of it all was . i wasn t any healthier for it and i certainly wasn t happier .","159009":"all this kids are wack as fuck . i d just take the tour and accept the free candy lol","159010":"meatless monday , recycling , bringing my own bags to the supermarket , walking more driving less when i don t have to , turning off the tap while i m not using it , not idling the car for long periods of time , picking up my pet s waste on walks , spreading awareness and the message of sustainability to others , not partaking in fast fashion , not flying in airplanes every year , switching off lights when not in use , not littering ,

why babies and puppies are cute has been revealed by oxford university researchers who say they evolved that way to survive . characteristics like big eyes , chubby cheeks , crying out , and giggling

thanks","159055":"i read one time that the whole reason people have middle names is that in the middle ages back when people hard core believed in magic and witches and stuff , you gave your children a secret name aka middle names so that when they introduced themselves to strangers they wouldn t be able to cast a spell on them if they were a witch since they didn t know the children s entire full name . not sure if that s fully true but it sounded like a cool story to me lol","159056":"yeah but it s bad luck to tell strangers what it is","159057":"hmmm . . . neither color looks good dressed on me lol but if i just had to choose a color i like better then def red","159058":"hmmm maybe september or october bc of fall ! !","159059":"a new font for a project","159060":"i can have patience with
