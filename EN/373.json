their following is oblivious to their lies.\n  ","400321":"\n  ???\n  \n  when it comes to science, medicine, and factual evidence, there is such a thing as right versus wrong. to try to claim that

recently that it's begun to be less stigmatized in society. people are talking about it more because they will not be k*lled, locked up, or chastised for talking about mental illness.\n  \n  \"big

people have gone into full remission thanks to medication.\n  ","400325":"\n  i'm not being condescending. i'm just calling you out on your problematic behavior, and you're trying to turn it around by

expertise of psychologists, psychiatrists, licensed clinical social workers and mental health counselors, etc etc., by calling them \"so-called experts.\" those people, above all else, determine the degree to which an individual is mentally ill and treats them accordingly. it isn't your authority to question the expertise of those individuals, and in doing so, you're questioning the plausibility of other people's mental illnesses as well.\n  \n  not to mention the fact that you've personally questioned my own mental illnesses, as well as the mental illnesses of others, and have tried to chalk them up to normal behavior when they're clinically abnormal.\n  ","400327":"\n  it isn't condescending if it's the truth -- you *are* ableist and insensitive towards others with mental illness, and although i've pointed out a plethora of ways that you are, you still won't acknowledge, apologize, or change your behavior.\n  ","400328":"\n  people who disagree with the plausibility of mental illness are not experts on the subject, and that goes for most areas of medicine. medicine does advance every day, but even so, it's your attitude that is most bothersome because you still will not admit that you've done wrong.\n  \n  over the course of the past few months (or longer?), i've seen you question others on askfm who are also mentally ill, and one by one, you've been shot down. i entertained your gig for a while, but it's time for you to acknowledge that your perception is problematic.\n  ","400329":"\n  that isn't condescending. mentally ill isn't an ableist word, and it's

be so rude.\n  ","400595":"\n  he is my ultimate strength. granted, we've gotten into some sticky situations together in the past, but overall he has made me a much better person than who i used to be based on his unconditional love and support of all of my endeavors.\n  ","400596":"\n  my ultimate, number one dream is to publish a book -- whether it's a book of short stories, a full-fledged novel, or a book of poetry. now that i've been trying to write consistently (these days, poetry and personal essays), i want to try to compile them into a book of sorts and eventually get published.\n  ","400597":"\n  graduating from college. my high school and college years were extremely difficult for me for various reasons (mental health, alcohol, drugs, etc etc), but i always had motivation to continue with my education because i knew it would lead to a better life in the future. i graduated college in 2013 with a 3.89 GPA and latin honors.\n  ","400598":"\n  being abandoned, without reason or explanation, by my boyfriend or the friends closest to me. i honestly don't know what i would do if they cut me out of their lives completely with no warning at all.\n  ","400599":"\n  my boyfriend, my best friend, my boyfriend's best friend, another close friend of mine who i basically consider a best friend at this point, and an old coworker from my previous job.\n  ","400600":"\n  absolutely -- without a doubt. it's always been a dream of mine to travel across the world.\n  ","400601":"\n  no, the only people i'm capable of missing are friends that i'm very open with. and if i miss them and\/or want to see them, then i have no problem with texting them and chatting.\n  ","400602":"\n  i had a forensics teacher in high school who helped me tremendously when i was a student (and even after i had graduated). he was very open about his dark past, including his struggle with drugs and time in the military, and i trusted him enough to confide in him my confusion regarding someone i knew who was addicted to drugs and i didn't know how to help them.\n  ","400603":"\n  fall into the addiction of self-harm at an extremely young age. it plagued me for the entirety of my teenage years, and i was constantly depressed, paranoid, misunderstood, and isolated.\n  ","400604":"\n  even though it's more of a repeat of the same song over & over and it's rather somber, i'm most motivated when i listen to the music from the halo 3: ODST soundtrack. right now, i'm listening to this compilation with a backdrop of falling rain ;\n  \n\n

of waking up from the dream. the only thing left over is my perception and feelings toward the dream itself, but the details totally disappear.\n  \n  i do have vivid nightmares that still haunt me at times, but they're more morbid and grotesque than strange.\n  ","400606":"\n  i'm uncomfortable stating what the darkest thing someone has told me is, because it could possibly implicate them and it's personal to them -- i wouldn't want to betray their trust.\n  \n  however, i also say that regardless of what that person has done and gone through in their life, i fully believe that they're a person worthy of love and respect.\n  ","400607":"\n  i believe it's emotionally easier to hate someone than it is to love someone -- which is why so many people are filled with hatred instead of opening their hearts and minds to the idea of love. if you've been hurt in the past, it's far easier to disregard and possibly dislike that person, which further taints your relationships with others in the future.\n  ","400608":"\n  i don't see how that could be a bad thing unless a person's race is central to the story. an example of this is hermione granger from the harry potter series -- her race has never explicitly been explained in the books, so there have been a lot of adaptations where she has been played by an actress who is a person of color.\n  ","400609":"\n  i fully support polyamorous relationships. if everyone involved in the relationship is happy and things are consensual among everyone involved, then i see absolutely nothing wrong with it.\n  ","400610":"\n  the first day of the new year has been good, and quite relaxing (and drama-free!). i slept in this morning until around 11:30am, had breakfast and coffee, and bullsh*tted on my laptop for a few hours while trying to go through my askfm inbox.\n  \n  afterwards, i got ready to go to my parents' house. i just came home not too long ago. we had dinner together and a \"second christmas\" to give my father his gifts, since he was out of state on christmas eve.\n  ","400611":"\n  on a physical level, people have told me that they like my eyes and my hair, which i agree with. i've always loved the color of my eyes and my hair is unique to me.\n  \n  on a mental\/emotional level, people have told me that i'm very passionate and talented when it comes to my writing. and although i have my doubts about my own writing at times, i do admit that i am proud of some of the works i've written over the years, especially ones that have moved others.\n  ","400612":"\n  no, hair doesn't much matter to me as long as it's obvious that they maintain it, keep it clean, etc etc. when my boyfriend and i started dating, he had shaggy hair. then as we got older, he grew his hair out to his shoulders. he's had it super short for the past few years.\n  ","400613":"\n  well, obviously he must have done something wrong in order for you not to trust him. ideally, he should be understanding and receptive toward your feelings and work towards establishing trust again. you cannot force someone to trust you, so his efforts to \"force\" you to trust him will only make matters worse.\n  ","400614":"\n  no, he's actually quite skinny and is upset that he has lost weight. he wants to start going to the gym to build up muscle.\n  ","400615":"\n  no, i've never pulled a fire alarm before.\n  ","400616":"\n  i tried my best to eat healthy, LOL. obviously there were some meals that i overstuffed myself with, but i chose healthy meals like lean proteins and a lot of vegetables. tonight, i kinda splurged -- my family ordered from outback steakhouse, and i had a 6oz filet mignon with a side of broccoli & cheese and a salad.\n  ","400617":"\n  DEFINITELY NOT. lmaoo.\n  \n  i'm going to be *swamped* with emails, and i'm terrified to check my inbox after being off from work since december 25th.\n  ","400618":"\n  LOL. no, i'm rather quiet either way.\n  ","400619":"\n  a nearly decade-long addiction to

was when i was a teenager.\n  ","400620":"\n  \"you're going to go through some of the darkest times of your life. you're going to want to give up, lie down, and d*e. you're going to want to scream

mean that i consider it a flaw myself, lol. we're our own worst critics.\n  ","400625":"\n  i suppose the most exciting thing that happened in 2019 was that i got two promotions at work exactly six months apart from each other. :'))\n  ","400626":"\n  my current relationship is my longest relationship -- we've been dating for 10 years.\n  ","400627":"\n  no, i don't watch competition or game shows at all. i don't have cable television, and the only shows i watch are things that are on netflix, hulu, amazon video, etc etc.\n  ","400628":"\n  there isn't anything about his looks that i dislike. he's incredibly attractive.\n  ","400629":"\n  i would like to see humanity burn, but the earth itself, definitely not. i value the health of the earth and its creature and i do believe that humans are a plague on the earth.\n  ","400630":"\n  he can be quite messy at times, but it's also gotten better over the years. he'll throw his clothes on the ground instead of in the hamper, sometimes cups and plates accumulate on the table, etc etc. he used to be *so* much worse when we were younger, but obviously we do learn to pick up after ourselves as we get older.\n  ","400631":"\n  i think online dating is a great idea if you're single and you're not quite sure where to look, especially as an adult. but you also have to remain quite hypervigilant about who you choose to talk to or meet because there are dozens of people in this world who prey on others in order to hurt them while giving off the appearance that they're charming.\n  ","400632":"\n  i normally don't because askfm is for answering questions, not holding conversations.\n  ","400633":"\n  no. if he was arrogant, then i wouldn't be dating him.\n  ","400634":"\n  the only cons i can think of is that they can get stained easily. i don't wear white clothing very often at all for that very reason.\n  \n  i don't know how many items of clothing i own, tbh. i have a closet full of various shirts, blouses, dresses, etc etc. i seldom get rid of things if they still fit me, so my closet is years' accumulation of various pieces.\n  ","400635":"\n  i've always preferred dogs over cats because i never had much experience with cats at all. however, after living with two cats for the past few months, they've really grown on me because they're both such sweet animals. i like cats and dogs equally.\n  ","400636":"\n  the last book i started reading (but never finished) was \"mindhunter: inside the FBI's elite serial crime unit\" by john douglas.\n  \n  i started reading it a few weeks ago, but then lost interest and never picked it back up again.\n  ","400637":"\n  abandonment by my loved ones. i know it's irrational because they have never showed any signs of abandoning me, but it's something i fear greatly nonetheless.\n  ","400638":"\n  \"i don't feel it anymore\" by william fitzsimmons & priscilla ahn.\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7r3xnilTjUw\n

advertisement on instagram.\n  ","400646":"\n  i don't necessarily set concrete resolutions for myself at the beginning of every year because then i feel as if they're doomed to fail.\n  \n  however, i do want to get more in touch with my creativity,  not give into more toxic friendships, and work harder at being the best version of myself possible.\n  ","400647":"\n  ???\n  \n  how is that being selfish?\n  ","400648":"\n  i love his eyes, but i also like my own eyes because they're a unique shade of green. but obviously i do like his more because they're a part of who he is, haha.\n  ","400649":"\n  his eyes are the hue of a setting sun, speckled with the frost and dew of tree trunks on a warm winter's eve. when there are logs sitting within the flame, they erupt within his face, the sparks reflected in his pupils. his eyes are espresso poured over ice, and the warmth emitting from the cold cup resembles the comfort radiating from his eyes' deepness, their darkness, their unrelenting beauty.\n  ","400650":"\n  i'm not entitled to free artwork just because someone is my friend. you're supposed to support your artists friends by buying and\/or donating to their work, just like anything else. it's why i bought quite a few pieces of art when i went to my friend's art show last week.\n  \n  usually artists' primary or secondary source of income is their art, and if you cannot afford to buy their art, then at the very least you can promote it.\n  ","400651":"\n  i've never tried digital drawing before, and i've only ever drawn using charcoal, pencil, and pastels. i also have painted in the past with oil paint and watercolors.\n  \n  besides the charcoal drawing i posted last night (my first time attempting charcoal in like 10 years), here's a piece of art i

 ","400656":"\n  i've never accepted a drink from a stranger, and i never will.\n  \n  there was one time my boyfriend convinced a new bartender (who didn't know him and i were dating) that he would buy me a drink and i would accept it. the bartender said, \"no way, leigh doesn't accept drinks from anyone!\" but my boyfriend told him to send me over a beer. the bartender gave me the beer and i nodded in my boyfriend's direction with a smirk on my face.\n  \n  the bartender was FLOORED, lmaoo. it was so amusing to see his reaction up until he saw us talking together and put two-and-two together.\n  ","400657":"\n  we all paid our own separate tabs, although i suspect that the bartender put a drink or two on my friend's tab because it was significantly less money than i expected to pay.\n  ","400658":"\n  i have been to a pool hall and stage theatre.\n  \n  i've always wanted to go to a jazz club and strip club, though. lmaoo. as well as a drag bar !! those seem like fun.\n

my episodes can last from days to weeks, and i've come to the understanding that my best might solely be getting out of bed to brush my teeth that day -- and that's perfectly okay.\n  \n  it's primarily a waiting game for me, although my depression has honestly been a hell of a lot better these days than in previous years. but whenever i *do* have an episode, the only thing i can do is wait for it to pass.\n  ","400736":"\n  for me, writing has always been deeply personal and has made me very vulnerable. it isn't going to move your audience if it doesn't come from a place of sincerity or pain from within yourself. write what you know best -- whether that's through heartache, family issues, relationship issues, trauma, etc etc.\n  \n  my writing has always been open and honest, and i find that i write my best work when i'm at a state of honesty within myself. you have to really sit there and think about how you're feeling, the source of those feelings, and the past history of those feelings and how they came to fruitation. it's really like you're psychoanalyzing yourself, but applying it to the character or whoever you're writing about.\n  ","400737":"\n  it would really

together if they already have children. it's perfectly healthy and normal for adult parents to do that.\n  ","400794":"\n  god forbid parents have a healthy s*x life despite having children, lol. there's nothing wrong with children (of appropriate age) knowing their parents have healthy and consensual s*x. if anything, it only leads to a greater understanding of what healthy s*x is and more responsible children.\n  ","400795":"\n  ???\n  \n  adults of any age can have s*x regardless of how many children they have. it doesn't set a bad example unless they're literally having s*x in the

personally, medication has been super helpful, but that's also because i've also been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. i'm on four different medications to try to combat each respective disorder, which can be exhausting and the process was grueling, but i'm happy i got to this point. i'm also involved in DBT therapy, which has helped greatly as well. i've been in therapy for a little over two years.\n  \n  my symptoms related to depression, at the very least, started when i was around 11 years old. i wasn't aware that it was depression at the time, and i only sought help in my 20s when my s*icidal ideation became increasingly severe. after meeting with my old psychiatrist numerous times, she diagnosed me first with personality disorder NOS and then decided on BPD after knowing more of my past history.\n  \n  most, if not all, personality disorders stem from an early age but i believe doctors are hesitant to diagnose until the age of 18 because teenagers naturally have hormonal imbalances to begin with, which can mimic disorders.\n  ","400797":"\n  this isn't a question. unless you have a question, you can kindly leave.\n  ","400798":"\n  yes, i'm a little bit familiar with maladaptive daydreaming. i'm obviously not qualified to say whether or not it's an illness in itself, but i do believe it can definitely be a strong symptom of an underlying mental illness that *is* recognized by the DSM.\n  ","400799":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","400800":"\n  this is actually a source of major anxiety for me, as i've always been unable to distinguish reality from fantasy, i.e. what my memories actually are versus what i've dreamed or envisioned. i have had memory loss from an early age and have basically lost over 10 years of my life due to trauma (or at least i assume), so my memories are always really vague.\n  \n  i'm uncertain of what has happened in my past. i know the ab*se i went through as a teenager, but everything beyond that is unknown to me. and my perception of events has always been in a gray area, so it's difficult for me to ascertain reality and fiction.\n  ","400801":"\n  (cont) ... to not be dependant on a

with what it does lol.\n  \n  --\n  \n  yeah, it's funny (well ... not really), when i was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago when i was like 24\/25 years old, i began realizing how many FP i had over the course of my teenage years without even realizing what it was. i *constantly* switched between people back and forth, some lasted for years while others were months or weeks, and then i would turn my back on them completely and forget they existed.\n  \n  i take a mood stabilizer to supplement my anti-depressant, among other pills, and it's actually helped somewhat with respect to my severe mood swings, at the very least. i'm still very much attached easily, paranoid, and i dissociate occasionally still though. :\/\n  ","400802":"\n  no. my snapchat and instagram are both private

significant manner, besides knowing that some \"friends\" were talking sh*t about me behind my back. i dropped them immediately.\n  ","400806":"\n  idk, that's a weird gray area. even though they respect my pronouns, they still don't believe that my gender exists and that's invalidating in itself. i don't really think i could maintain a friendship with them if they weren't understanding of non-binary people or even took the time to try to understand.\n  ","400807":"\n  (cont) ... but when u do give that person ur all and truly care abt them, they screw u over & ur left to repeat the

as i like hers, and it hurts because she responds faster to my roommate than she does to me, and i always feel like she doesn't even really like me.\n  \n  but it isn't something i would ever bring up, because well BPD and i know i'm acting a bit ridiculous. i'm so attached to her and i get so excited whenever she messages me first, and hanging out with her is so much fun and i'm so happy and content when we do chill. but at the same time, i get so resentful whenever she doesn't pay me any attention or turns down my plans and i know that's really toxic of me to do that.\n  ","400808":"\n

this was completely sudden for me. & he kept trying to give me advice on how to improve my life & wish me best of luck & i just didn't wanna hear it. i felt it was inconsiderate of him to do despite understanding the reasoning behind it. i feel like the communication was poor & i felt hurt & stupid. to sum it all up, do you think my feelings are valid? i do have bpd so i do tend to get attached, im also really lonely so i cling on to anyone that makes me happy. thanks so much for reading\n  \n  --\n  \n  yes, your feelings are *completely* valid !! and tbh, if i was in your shoes, i would feel the exact same way. it appears to have sprung up out of nowhere with no warning whatsoever, and maybe it's just my paranoia talking, but perhaps he had an ulterior motive in disconnecting from you (like if he met someone else?).\n  \n  i understand the BPD aspect all too well, especially considering i switch between \"favorite people\" far too often for my own good. i become obsessive and attached far too easily, and then i end up becoming hurt as a result because obviously they don't reciprocate those same feelings.\n  \n  all in all, your feelings are totally valid and i understand why you're hurting. i also understand his reasoning, but he did go about this the wrong way and he should have been a tad bit more considerate of your feelings.\n  ","400814":"\n  i'll never

which is nice.\n  ","400843":"\n  on occasion, haha. it's always a weird coincidence, for sure.\n  ","400844":"\n  abandonment by my loved ones.\n  ","400845":"\n  i occasionally get follow up questions, and i do enjoy them because it means that someone is interested enough in my answer to want to learn more.\n  ","400846":"\n  yeah, i've smoked on countless occasions beginning from the age of 16.\n  ","400847":"\n  quit vaping -- that would be the most realistic scenario that might improve my life. i smoked cigarettes for 11 years, and when i quit i started vaping instead. however, i also know that vaping isn't the healthiest alternative and it would be beneficial to my health if i quit that too.\n  \n  there's nothing stopping me really besides my own free will. i don't want to quit just yet.\n  ","400848":"\n  the concept behind memento mori (latin for \"remember you must die\"). it's usually an artistic rendering of the inevitability of death, and places emphasis on making the most out of life because we all succumb to death eventually.\n  ","400849":"\n  i don't really think i've done anything amazing in my life, haha. and the things i have done that i'm proud of, i've talked about it to people so it's not as if no one knew about them.\n  ","400850":"\n  i would probably be hurt by their words, especially if it's someone who claims they love me (whether it's family, friends, or a partner). i would second guess their feelings towards me because if they really did care about me, they wouldn't put me in a position to hurt me.\n  ","400851":"\n  morality is having a sense of right versus wrong, so when i think about morals, i think about criminal justice and the psychology behind why people do certain things (as well as their rationale behind it).\n  \n  i've honestly always considered myself to have a skewed sense of morality, tbh.\n  ","400852":"\n  no, i haven't. it isn't something i would be interesting in doing, anyway.\n  ","400853":"\n  my aunt got me a sketchbook and a charcoal kit for christmas. i've been meaning to play around with it, but haven't felt inspired.\n  ","400854":"\n  read, try to write something creatively, exercise, draw, etc etc.\n  ","400855":"\n  streaming video games, probably. the equipment is super expensive, though, and i rarely have the time to play as it is.\n  ","400856":"\n  my laptop. it's definitely a luxury, but i do love having it for both browsing the internet, writing, and doing research to complement my writing.\n  ","400857":"\n  relationship advice, help with mental illness, or writing advice.\n  ","400858":"\n  i normally just put on ambient background music, like the skyrim soundtrack or the music from halo, harry potter, or game of thrones.\n  ","400859":"\n  yes, it has happened on numerous occasions. i apologize as soon as i realize i did something wrong.\n  ","400860":"\n  i'm fine with criticism, yeah. it's difficult to be upset over criticism when you've studied what i have studied, haha. i've taken courses and workshops where people have criticized my writing, which is something i'm most passionate about, and eventually you learn to either take the advice and apply it or disregard what anyone has to say.\n  ","400861":"\n  i suppose my writing is my most impressive talent. i've been commended on several occasions for my skills in writing, and it's also something i'm very passionate about.\n  ","400862":"\n  why certain things have happened to me throughout my life. where i went wrong with some friendships and relationships. what i could have done to saved someone or made life better for other people.\n  ","400863":"\n  i don't usually go anywhere. i like relaxing and staying home.\n  ","400864":"\n  idk about breaking up with someone, but it's definitely a conversation worth having with them.\n  ","400865":"\n  no, it doesn't really bother me at all. i've rarely had people use my questions as fillers anyway.\n  ","400866":"\n  depends on how self-confident i'm feeling that day.\n  ","400867":"\n  my inbox is empty -- send me your questions !!\n  ","400868":"\n  then they most likely will not verify you.\n  ","400869":"\n  i would much rather live for an additional 10 years in good health. i wouldn't want to be in poor health to the point where people would have to take care of me, and i would much rather have a shorter lifespan if that means i can still be independent and feeling good.\n  ","400870":"\n  i'm neutral on it. it doesn't offer any benefits or anything, it just shows others that i'm a real profile and not a fake account.\n  ","400871":"\n  i love the quality of my phone's camera. i have a samsung galaxy s10 and the camera is superb.\n  \n  i've had bad phones in the past, particularly my first few flip phones in the early 2000s, haha.\n  ","400872":"\n  ideally, you should not compromise either your happiness and your time in relationships. however, i do believe happiness matters most -- and if you're in a relationship where your happiness is not being given a priority by your partner, then that's a sign that perhaps you two aren't doing well together.\n  ","400873":"\n  last night while waiting in line at the pharmacy to pick up my medication. :\/\n  \n  the line was super long, people were talking and arguing, the music in the store was loud, and it was just sensory overload.\n  ","400874":"\n  i've never been to a magic show before, so i honestly don't know. it was never something i was interested in.\n  ","400875":"\n  when it comes to writing, i'm better at poetry & prose than he is. mainly because i've been writing since i was a child, took multiple courses in creative writing and grammar, and i practice every day at my job.\n  \n  he's also pretty good at writing creatively, but he seldom does it because he isn't so much interested in writing in general.\n  ","400876":"\n  i'm most proud of this photo that i took a few years ago on a minolta film camera. i wish i still had that camera -- i prefer film over digital photographs.\n  ","400877":"\n  perhaps i'm ignorant, but i've never heard this theory before. if the people still have the free will to commit crimes even though they've been set up, then i do believe that it's fair for them to be arrested afterwards.\n  ","400878":"\n  i'm 28 years old.\n  ","400879":"\n  i believe it was around 2011 or 2012.\n  ","400880":"\n  i'm sorry, i don't understand the question. are you asking where i'm from?\n  ","400881":"\n  they're a bit yellow from drinking coffee all the time, so no.\n  ","400882":"\n  if you're open to their messages and take the time to self-reflect, then sure. however, if you're steadfast in your old ways and aren't open to changing yourself to be a better version of yourself, then the books won't help you.\n  ","400883":"\n  i'm a much better listener than i am a talker. i find it hard to express myself verbally when speaking, and i like listening to other people tell me their stories and concerns because i want to offer insight and help them.\n  ","400884":"\n  sorta? i've read \"be here now\" by ram dass, but it was a very long time ago. it was very enlightening to me at the time, especially considering how spiritual i used to be.\n  ","400885":"\n  i don't really think there's a correlation between the two. those who are good at their job (or whatever they do for work) are that way because of a hard work ethic and ability to focus. it wouldn't necessarily matter if someone is emotionally detached or emotionally invested in their work unless their emotions are deterring them from actually getting the job done.\n  ","400886":"\n  no, we don't have wind chimes.\n  ","400887":"\n  i believe the egg came first, because chickens are not the only animals that lay eggs. there has been proof that some animals, long ago, laid eggs that hatched to young and i believe that as time passed on and evolution began happening, it transcended to such animals as chickens.\n  ","400888":"\n  i would rather bend water. as a water sign (scorpio), i've always felt very comfortable around the water, and i've also always been very fluid and wavering, particularly in my likes and dislikes. as for the physical component of water, it would be interesting to affect the tides.\n  ","400889":"\n  the fact that you're taking this so personally and won't let it go means that *you're* the one taking it to heart, lmaoo.\n  \n  if you want to know what kissing feels like, go find a partner and kiss them. it isn't that deep.\n  ","400890":"\n  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","400891":"\n  i won't apologize for giving into your obvious fetish. like i said, unless you have appropriate questions, then you can leave.\n  ","400892":"\n  like i said, i have memory loss. what memories come naturally to most people does not happen with me, and i have both short-term and long-term memory loss.\n  \n  if you're looking for some sort of satisfaction to your fetish, you can kindly stop inquiring into my past \"kissing history.\" you're not going to get what you want here.\n  ","400893":"\n  that isn't being in the friend zone. that's just a woman taking advantage of someone else's feelings to suit their own desires. it definitely isn't \"evil,\" but it's wrong and manipulative.\n  ","400894":"\n  i don't believe that all humans want to same things in life, besides the basics like food and shelter. there are some people who are controlled by greed, and their desires are much different than the desires of others. these people are also mostly people in positions of power, like governmental positions, so the reason why there is so much violence and strife is because they have the means to be so.\n  \n  as for the common man, some people are simply grown into violence and their desires are less pure because they want to hurt people.\n  ","400895":"\n  i mean, if you're asking from the time i turned 18 years old, then it's something i don't quite remember either because i had been dating my boyfriend for a year at that point, and it definitely wasn't our first kiss together, lol.\n  ","400896":"\n  i have memory loss, so i cannot remember anything prior to the age of 11 or so. the rest of the years (pre-teen years and teenagehood) are vague to me as well.\n  ","400897":"\n  i believe we should measure the value of our lives in the experiences we gain along the way, as well as our accomplishments -- and sometimes even our failures, because failure teaches us to be better and do better.\n  \n  years come and go, but what truly matters is what we've learned through the unique experiences we come across, as well as our various accomplishments we succeed at along the way.\n  ","400898":"\n  i honestly don't remember. my first kiss was when i was like ... 12 years old, i believe.\n  ","400899":"\n  i don't believe in the concept of the \"friend zone,\" it's mainly used by entitled men who cannot take the word \"no\" for an answer when they're rejected by women. if someone refuses your advances, then you have to accept it for what it is, and if someone wants to remain friends, then they're not \"friend zoning\" you, they're simply being honest with their feelings.\n  ","400900":"\n  pretty much any movie by quentin tarantino, lol. he's one of my favorite directors and i absolutely love some of his movies, like pulp fiction, kill bill, django unchained, and inglourious bastards.\n  ","400901":"\n  yes, absolutely. there are a lot of educational games out there that teach you different facts (trivial pursuit and jeopardy, for example). there are also various games with puzzles in them that make you think out of the box.\n  ","400902":"\n  i would definitely choose money over fame, especially considering i would never want fame to begin with. i have too much social awkwardness and anxiety to ever be comfortable with being famous.\n  ","400903":"\n  to be a version of myself, but more self-assured and amplified. i want to take on more opportunities instead of shying away from them. i want to delve further into my creativity and write more often. i want to progress further in my recovery and healing. i want to work on myself for a change, instead of focusing my efforts solely on other people.\n  ","400904":"\n  you're not entitled to say how i should act or look, and you're acting incredibly arrogant and obnoxious. any further judgment or expectations from you will swiftly be deleted.\n  \n  i am who i am, and if you don't like that then you can unfollow and\/or block me.\n  ","400905":"\n  i'm satisfied somewhat, but not satisfied in other aspects. much like any other year, there have been both ups and downs and what i've learned is that i have to \"roll with the punches,\" as they say, because there is no use in regretting the past especially when there's nothing i can do to change what has happened.\n  ","400906":"\n  i do have to admit, i am one of those people. i like seeing my follower count increase because i have a weird obsession with numbers, and it does only help to show me that people are interested in what i have to say -- especially considering how much i talk about and raise awareness for mental health.\n  \n  i don't care so much about likes, except for when it comes to my writing (for example) that i've posted on instagram. i haven't posted anything since early december, sadly, but it did mean a lot to me when people did like my poetry and prose on there.\n  ","400907":"\n  thankfully, i've never been stood up before. at least not on purpose, LOL. there have been a few times that my friends didn't show up to where we were going when we were supposed to go out, but it was because they fell asleep and totally lost track of time.\n  ","400908":"\n  i never really understood it, especially in a casual context, because it just sounds totally weird and awkward. lmaoo.\n  ","400909":"\n  (cont) ... understood and validated. I\u2019m sure a lot of people that have read your works feel the same way too. I have been following you here for a very long time now, and I have always supported you in everything that you have done. I have also seen you grow a lot as a person and achieve so many things. Whether it\u2019s being promoted or moving out of your parents\u2019 house, I have seen all your progress. It makes me very happy to see you being so resilient and strong despite still having bad days. I am sure in the future or near future, you would continue to make progress in terms of work or healing. I appreciate that you are still here in this present moment. For each day you decide to still be here, I am thankful. Even though some days will be difficult, I hope you have the strength to keep going. I really really appreciate you and your works. Thank you. \u2764\ufe0f\n  \n  --\n  \n  well ... thanks for making me almost cry, LOL. this is the most heartfelt message i've ever received, and i'm *so* grateful and humbled to have received such a message and have influenced at least one person in a positive manner with my openness and writing about mental illness. it's something i always hope for when i advocate for awareness, and i'm glad i'm succeeding in at least a small way.\n  \n  thank you again -- your words are deeply appreciated, and i'm so happy that someone recognizes and relates to everything i've endured through my journey. this really made my morning, and i'm so thankful for this message. you're far too kind, anon.\n  ","400910":"\n  i literally just answered a similar question less than five minutes ago, lol. yes, i know how to cook but i can only really cook simple meals.\n  ","400911":"\n  i buy phones based on how they work. i would hate to have a nice-looking phone, but it doesn't allow you to customize anything or work very well at all (i.e. freezing a lot, glitching, not connecting to wifi, etc etc).\n  ","400912":"\n  i know how to cook simple meals, but that's pretty much it.\n  ","400913":"\n  i only have a few close friends, and i'm perfectly fine with that. i like having a small, intimate inner circle of people whom i can trust, and having too many friends may only lead to further hurt and betrayal.\n  ","400914":"\n  definitely not, lol. i was kinda \"known\" in school because of my art, but i was not popular and only had few friends.\n  ","400915":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","400916":"\n  i like the latin language, even though i don't understand it well. \"poeta\" is sorta the latin root for poetry, and \"lunam\" is the root for the moon. i mashed them together to create poetalunam, which to me represents the poetry and beauty of the moon.\n  ","400917":"\n  yeah, definitely. not because i didn't understand it, but because the mission\/level was way too difficult for me and i couldn't get past it even though i tried a hundred times, lmaoo.\n  ","400918":"\n  there are some small businesses whose sole mission is to raise awareness of mental illness through the products they sell. for example, i'm a big fan of the business schizophrenic.NYC -- it's based out of new york city, and they sell various prints and pins and shirts and whatnot with various sayings related to schizophrenia and the stigma associated with it.\n  \n  they recently got big because of their new shirt that says \"i'm mentally ill and i don't k*ll\" based on recent events where the media has been blaming mental illness for tragedies, like shootings and stuff.\n  ","400919":"\n  this is actually very true, and i didn't think about it in this respect. valid point, my friend.\n  ","400920":"\n  ah, the more you know !! thank you ~~\n  ","400921":"\n  i wasn't comfortable being blonde, and i much prefer being brunette or having an unnatural color.\n  \n  get over it. life doesn't revolve around you.\n  ","400922":"\n  i'm currently in love.\n  ","400923":"\n  instagram for my poetry ; @\/mortem.musings\n  \n  medium link ;\n  \n   https:\/\/medium.com\/\n  \n  @poetalunam\n  ","400924":"\n  nah, i don't have a youtube channel. i only use youtube to watch videos of the channels that i follow.\n  ","400925":"\n  wow ... this is honestly one of the best messages i've ever received. thank you so much for your kind words, and this is the sort of response i strive towards when it comes to me posting about mental health and my own experiences. :'))\n  \n  for the past few weeks, i've been trying to write a *very* vulnerable, open essay about my mental illnesses stemming from childhood, and sorta psychoanalyzing myself with the help from my therapist. it's been pretty difficult and i keep stopping and coming back to it, but i'm hoping to finish it soon. i don't know when i'll feel comfortable posting it, but we'll see.\n  ","400926":"\n  i regularly post & re-post information regarding mental health to reduce stigma. i talk about my own experiences with mental illness to show others that they're not alone in their struggles. i write creatively and showcase my work that reflect my thoughts and feelings regarding my mental illnesses and post them to various websites. i support charities and small businesses that also advocate for better understanding of mental health and illness.\n  ","400927":"\n  perhaps it was because i was a bit too young to watch the movie, but \"the grudge\" scared the crap out of me when i was a teenager\/pre-teen. it haunted me for weeks afterwards.\n  \n  my favorite scary movies are the \"saw\" movies, if those are considered to be scary. i think of them more as psychological thrillers, but there are some scary components to them. i also like \"the hills have eyes,\" \"hostel,\" \"house of wax,\" \"high tension,\" and \"the texas chainsaw massacre.\"\n  ","400928":"\n  i don't agree that everything we know is subject to debate. there are things that are concrete facts, such as the sciences, that cannot be debated because they are the absolute truth. those facts are guaranteed knowledge.\n  ","400929":"\n  i don't know anything about the birds in my area, but apparently we get hawks and falcons, which is pretty cool.\n  ","400930":"\n  normally my own moods ruin a good time, lmaoo. i could be having a great time with friends, but then an invasive thought will come into my mind, or my anxiety or paranoia kicks in, and they completely ruin the experience for me.\n  \n  also, people who are overly negative in conversation are guaranteed to ruin good times. such as people who do nothing but complain or gossip about others.\n  ","400931":"\n  i've always considered \"films\" to be classics, i.e. gone with the wind, a walk to remember, west side story, cinema paradiso, etc etc. \"movies,\" on the other hand, are just any sort of cinematic experience you see in the theater or at home on DVD.\n  ","400932":"\n  fried when on egg sandwiches, and scrambled when eaten alone (and obviously with sides of bacon and toast).\n  ","400933":"\n  whenever i think about \"records,\" i

or for worse.\n  ","400935":"\n  i always liked ralph lauren's polo black cologne.\n  ","400936":"\n  things needed around the house, perhaps some shampoo and body wash, future gifts for

driving down the highway. i understand it's rush hour on a saturday night, but smh. i'm so impatient.\n  ","400939":"\n  they make me super paranoid because i don't want people knowing where i live. but as you told me the other day, it seems like it's a nation-wide thing which makes it seem a lot better.\n  \n  i have them turned off, so i don't receive any shout outs in my inbox.\n  ","400940":"\n  who cares, tbh. they're total strangers and even if they are talking sh*t about you, it's meaningless to you and your life, and you'll likely never see these people again. even if they're your friends, if you suspect then they're talking about you then you're probably better off finding new friends.\n  \n  also, if they're \"leaving you out\" of the conversation then you're not entitled to be in the conversation in the first place. people are allowed to talk to others around you without including you, especially if it has nothing to do with you.\n  ","400941":"\n  no? i'm not even attractive, lol.\n  ","400942":"\n  this summer sucked in general, lmaoo. i guess going into HR and having the director compliment my work and progress, and then being promoted, was a pretty good memory.\n  ","400943":"\n  osteoporosis from straining the neck and back to look either forward at a screen or down at a cell phone screen (there's some indication that people are growing bone spurs in their necks due to prolonged activity). severe eye strain and deterioration because of the artificial light coming from screens, as well as looking at a screen in general.\n  \n  for computer users, sitting down for prolonged periods of time is very unhealthy for your body and posture, and people are encouraged to sit and stand intermittently if they have a job where they have to sit for eight hours per day.\n  ","400944":"\n  no? why would that be rude?\n  \n  they're having their own conversation in their own language, and that has nothing to do with me. i'm not entitled to know what they're talking about.\n  ","400945":"\n  last night, i went to a local art show\/beer garden\/music gig with a few friends to support some local artists. came back home with some beautiful gear.\n  ","400946":"\n  i don't see anything special about 2020 in particular -- to me, it's just another upcoming year that's going to be filled with both enjoyment and disappointment much like any other year.\n  ","400947":"\n  the next generation is definitely going to face the repercussions of climate change, and our society's lack of acknowledgment and steps taken to delay or even reverse

parents used corporal punishment to discipline me when i was younger, often as a result of things children or teenagers typically do. i always thought i deserved the pain and humiliation, but as i got older, i realized i didn't deserve the ab*se i went through.\n  ","400950":"\n  i don't make concrete resolutions because i feel like they just set people up for failure. however, i do want to work towards the following without putting much pressure on myself ;\n  \n  -- getting back more into my creative side, through writing and drawing and reading.\n  \n  -- eat healthier and drink more water, since i rarely drink water these days. :\/\n  \n  -- get back into exercising regularly.\n  \n  -- move forward with my healing with respect to my past and mental health. progressing forward

make me uncomfortable.\n  ","400951":"\n  i like learning about serial killers, other mass murderers and people who hurt other people in general. taxidermy is incredibly interesting to me and i like

off. they mistake either for love.\n  \n  --\n  \n  yes, i 100% agree with this. i had one relationship when i was a teenager which was totally toxic (he was 18-19 years old and i was only 13-14 years old, so that gives you an idea). social media wasn't prevalent at the time, but we did a lot of \"public displays of affection\" at school to show our alleged love for each other. i was smitten with him despite his toxic traits, and also because i was totally naive, but eventually i did realize how bad he was for me and i was the one who broke up with him after about six months.\n  ","400956":"\n

having trust in and communication with your partner. you always need to have open communication in your relationship because otherwise things will not progress or improve. obviously in some cases it's hard to be honest, but it's also for the best because you need a foundation of trust in order for the relationship to be successful.\n  \n  this goes for platonic relationships as well as romantic relationships, by the way.\n  ","400976":"\n  no, i don't believe in karma. there are too many people who do terrible things who don't get punished for what they've done, and there are also so many

one of the most common misconceptions about love is that others believe that once you find someone you love, things will be easy from thereon out.\n  \n  in fact, it's quite the opposite. loving

like me, and they didn't think it would last very long.\n  \n  however, i did this for quite a few semesters in order to afford my bills, gas, food, school books, etc etc. it was a stable source of income and made me much more comfortable, and i did it out of a need to, not necessarily because i wanted to, which was more of a motivation to keep moving forward.\n  ","401004":"\n  first of all -- i understand completely where you're coming from regarding your efforts at being close to your mother and what you've gone through in order to be validated by her. i've experienced that myself, and often through the same methods because my mother is exactly the same way.\n  \n  i also understand being freaked out and feeling like you betrayed your friend, as well, especially with respect to BPD. BPD makes our emotions so much more intense than they rationally should be, and i do have to say that your reaction to telling your mother about your friend is a bit irrational !! but that's perfectly okay, because awareness is the most important part.\n  \n  i think it would be appropriate to tell your friend what you told your mother, although honestly i don't think your friend would think it's a big deal *at all* because it is the truth and you also didn't go into detail regarding it at all. it isn't so much gossip as it is updating your mother on the situation on a very vague, surface level. your friend is most likely going to tell you that it's perfectly fine and you have nothing to worry about.\n  \n  it's also appropriate to tell your therapist, since i'm sure they'll reiterate the same things i'm telling you now. it's a good source of validation that you did not do the wrong thing, because i genuinely believe your actions are justified and you did absolutely nothing wrong.\n  \n  i hope this helped !!\n  ","401005":"\n  my boyfriend and i are pitching in to buy my roommate a new xbox one for christmas, since he couldn't take his old xbox with him when he moved out of his

coworkers a few weeks ago about how my roommate and i made a lot of spaghetti and meatballs for dinner the previous night. for some reason, i couldn't think of a better say to explain how much we made, so i ended up blurting out, \"there were so many spaghettis!\" lmaoo.\n  ","401007":"\n  depending on the class, we either got graded A-F marks or through percentage marks that equated to the

as my current mood in that moment. there have been times when i've taken it way too personally and got upset over it, while there are other times when it doesn't bother me whatsoever.\n  ","401271":"\n  thanks, i appreciate it !!\n  ","401272":"\n  no, you don't. life was so much simpler when all i had to worry about was attending college and doing a part-time job, lmaoo.\n  ","401273":"\n  it should only take a few hours, but i'm sure the grocery store is going to be filled to the brim with people buying groceries for their christmas dinners. :\/\n  ","401274":"\n  there are definitely some benefits to attending college, but it isn't for everyone. just study hard, try your best, and think of the positive outcomes.\n  \n  i was just on my facebook memories, and my graduation day from college was six years ago today, haha.\n  ","401275":"\n  i'm thinking about the various errands i'll have to run later today when my roommate gets home. we're going to go grocery shopping, then we need to hit a few stores for some final christmas shopping before next week.\n  ","401276":"\n  if you're asking why colleges and schools in general give final exams at the end of the semester, it's simply a way of quizzing your knowledge of what you've learned the entire semester in order to give you the final grade.\n  \n  i never really liked big exams like that because i found them to be intimidating, but it's simply the way it is and it's always been the case. i would prefer courses to test you periodically throughout the semester and add up that cumulative grade instead of having, for example, one mid-term and one final exam.\n  ","401277":"\n  it depends on the bank, but yes -- most banks are closed on christmas day, and some are even closed on christmas eve.\n  ","401278":"\n  when i was on a major health kick, i used to only drink coffee with stevia and vanilla soy milk. but lately, i only have coffee at home on the weekends (during the week, i just make coffee at work and don't have any when i get home), so i just use various flavors of creamer. lately i've been using a peppermint mocha creamer. :'))\n  ","401279":"\n  LOL, no. i have not seen that footage. that isn't how it works ... for either portion of this message.\n  ","401280":"\n  oh wow, that's terrible. when i was in college, i remember having final exams the week before christmas but never on christmas eve.\n  ","401281":"\n  unfortunately, i don't have the collection anymore since i moved houses. i kept half of my mugs at my parents' house and only took 3-4 of my favorite mugs to my new house. however, i got two more mugs for christmas from my coworkers, so the collection is slowly growing, rofll.\n  \n  my favorite mug is my \"mental health advocate\" white mug. it holds 16oz of coffee and is white, and for some reason i love white mugs because it's such a stark contrast to the coffee or tea that's inside.\n  ","401282":"\n  i'm content with staying home, catching up on my favorite television shows, making pots of coffee, and seeing my friends.\n  ","401283":"\n  thank you -- happy holidays to you as well !!\n  ","401284":"\n  no, i don't believe it's going to get that wild. there has always been tension between the republican and democratic parties, but violence normally comes from individuals, not a group as a whole.\n  ","401285":"\n  christmas festivities !! my office always celebrates the holidays, especially since so many people are off from work next week.\n  ","401286":"\n  a crackling fireplace is one of the only ways for me to relax. it's so tranquil and peaceful.\n  ","401287":"\n  serotonin would be pleasant.\n  ","401288":"\n  i have a terrible habit of skin-picking, also known as dermatillomania. i pick at blemishes on my skin until they bleed and scab and scar over. there are scars littered all over my body.\n  \n  other than that, i do bite my nails and cuticles a lot, too.\n  ","401289":"\n  i suppose i'm a professional in writing and\/or proofreading, considering that's what i have a degree in and do for my current job.\n  ","401290":"\n  grandson !! i love his political activism, the messages he spreads to his fanbase, and his passion for music.\n  ","401291":"\n  i have a collection of mugs !! it wasn't an intentional collection by any means, though. i just love buying cute mugs, and then people have seemed to realize that i love mugs too, so they would always gift them to me.\n  ","401292":"\n  graduation day. lmaoo.\n  ","401293":"\n  i'm left-handed in general, so everything i do is done with my left hand.\n  ","401294":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","401295":"\n  no, there's too much light pollution where i live. i rarely ever see the stars.\n  ","401296":"\n  does \"a nightmare before christmas\" count as a christmas film? LOL.\n  ","401297":"\n  thank you !! my coworkers got me a portable charger for my vape (because it's always dying on me, lmaoo), a few cards with nice messages written in them, some candy, a mug, and the coworker with whom i work directly in the production of the magazine bought me a really nice bottle of red wine. it was very thoughtful.\n  ","401298":"\n  i was happy the day of the impeachment, up until i remembered that the senate is run by republicans and they're not going to remove trump from office, it's as simple as that.\n  \n  obviously impeachment is a step in the right direction, and i'm glad that these changes are occurring, but i don't personally believe anything will come of this.\n  ","401299":"\n  being transphobic isn't a personal opinion. it's a violation of human rights to deny the existence or status of someone because of their gender.\n  ","401300":"\n  trump has already been impeached by the house of representatives. however, that doesn't mean he's been removed from office -- there still needs to be a trial through the senate for them to determine whether or not he'll be removed.\n  \n  other presidents who have been impeached in the past simply resigned from their positions. i doubt highly trump will do this. if he's removed from office by the senate, then i do believe pence will become president because he's the next in line, so to speak.\n  ","401301":"\n  i'm pretty content at the moment, actually. i woke up about 30 minutes ago, and i'm just sitting at my laptop and drinking some coffee.\n  "}}
