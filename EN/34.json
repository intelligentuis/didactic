Birthday! ?\n  ","36518":"\n  Honestly we're used to being quarantined since we're out on the countryside and then we're used to always spending time with each other and entertaining each other because sometimes it gets boring out here. We go outside and do things around the house go fishing, hunting. Just depends. Gardening. And then I'm used to being away from a lot of friends and family for a few months at a time or longer. Just depends. We plan to go back and forth and visit. The only thing that has changed honestly is the fact that I haven't been able to really do a bunch of traveling trips which is okay. It's different, but nothing impossible to do. But I have definitely seen other people learn from this, because a lot of people just don't spend time with their siblings and their kids. And sometimes it's not even their fault. They're having to work so much just to be able to pay the bills around the house. Instead of being able to be at home resting and spending time with family.\n  \n  Then lot of people have been really agitated and ill coming into our store for no reason and taking it out on us when they honestly should be appreciating people that are working in retail because honestly we could be closed.  We are being so exposed to all of this stuff and trying our best to keep ourselves safe. Same thing to the other essential workers that are around a lot of people. I've always been very clean. I've always washed my hands a lot during the day. My hands are always really dry because of that reason so I try to use a lot of lotion. I have always kept my house cleaned and my environment clean and our vehicles cleaned but it's just kind of funny watching everybody else freak out and magically start cleaning out of nowhere like they have never cleaned before. Over the time of living in my life I have gained a lot of patience for things so I'm just patiently waiting for this to end.

A lot of people are thinking it is funny and a joke and aren't staying at home quarantined and away from people that are at risk. When I honestly we all are at risk. Because some people are carriers. You could be having mild symptoms and not even realize it and you're carrying the virus and getting other people sick. Not just older people are. There are tons of people that are at the age of 10 15 20 30 that have the covid-19 virus as well as even infants babies. It's really sad and nothing to play around with and it is not funny. There are people that are not making it right now as we speak. It is sad to think... But I am very appreciative to be able to be alive and living other day. I do not take this for granted.

Sometimes you try to get into further ships with friends and it don't always happen correctly, so sometimes, you just go back to being just friends. Sometimes it doesn't go back to the same and sometimes it does and my case it worked. It's more or less... like with burning bridges. Is it really worth burning the bridge? Or is it worth being friends with them at all after? Because sometimes it's not. Better to go your separate ways. Or is it really that big of a deal of why you two broke up? Can you go back to being friends? All of these are the questions that you ask yourself. And as I said before, sometimes it's really easy to go back to being just friends and sometimes it's impossible and you just need to not talk to each other and cut all ties. I have one friend that I grew up with and we dated off and on for years but we never really understood why it would never work out but the reason later on we figured it out is because we were better off being just friends. So we are still friends but we don't talk everyday. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. It depends on what your intentions are with that friendship. And that's when trust comes in. Got to trust somebody when it comes to making friends with both girls and guys. That's life. Then control. All those old feelings aren't there anymore. Just friends type of feeling is there and only. It is possible. It is not impossible. Nothing is impossible. We are all independent people. We have the ability to do anything we set our minds too. We need to give ourselves more credit. Confidence. It plays a big role in our lives.\n  \n  My husband me and him are actually good friends. We check in on that old friend of mine because he is dealing with a lot. And as I said before we literally went back to just being friends. And honestly it's something to be proud of yourself about. Most people just want to run from things. I embrace my mistakes.
