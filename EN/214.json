The virus doesn\u2019t survive in other animals like it does in people.\n  \n  When asked about the subject of masking your pets in public, liscenced veterinarians Dr. Natalie Marks and Dr. Keri Bayley both advised against the practice. They both agreed that there is not enough air circulation nor room in masks for pets to breathe properly because of the shape of their noses and faces, unlike people. Because pets cannot contract or spread the disease, the point is mute anyways.\n  \n  The veterinarians also stated that masking pets also restricts their access to water, which can be dangerous, as pets including horses, cannot tell us when they\u2019re thirsty, and dehydration could lead to severe health risks.\n  \n  If you\u2019d like more info about how to care for your equine friend during these pandemic times click the link below:\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.fdacs.gov\/Agriculture-Industry\/Horses-Equine\/Caring-for-Your-Horse-During-COVID-19\n  \n","229671":"\n  V original thanks for that\n  ","229672":"\n  Ignore!

People are also predatory pack animals, so when training a horse you need to think about how your training requests are portrayed in their eyes and adjust your behavior so they don\u2019t get too overwhelmed or afraid.

There are a lot of questionable and, in my opinion, quite cruel things that happen behind the scenes at a lot of race tracks that I fervently disagree with. Even when owners try to treat their race horses fairly, the actual act of running races at such a high speeds for such a distance is extremely tough on a horse\u2019s body and has a lot of detrimental effects :\/ A lot of what happens to horses as a result of the racing industry is just awful so I don\u2019t support it.\n  ","230175":"\n  I don\u2019t even know what he looks like lol but he\u2019s super old now isn\u2019t he?\n  ","230176":"\n  Dude you couldn\u2019t possibly annoy me with horse questions!

In my opinion English style riding is more fun because you can eventually learn to jump with the horse, but western riding is equally fun if you\u2019re just learning to ride on the flat (walk, trot, canter, gallop w\/ no jumping).\n  \n  Riding lessons in my area usually go for about $35-40 for each one hour session. You show up with jeans and shoes with a low heel (like cowboy boots, not high heels lol) and they\u2019ll provide the horse and equipment! Make sure you get yourself a good horse riding helmet! Some places will provide you with one but it\u2019s always much safer to have one you know fits your head well.

As soon as the horse even begins to start doing what I\u2019m asking them, even if it\u2019s not perfect or it\u2019s just a step in the right direction, I stop asking and let them think about it.

Out of the goodness of my heart, I\u2019m willing to overlook the passive aggressive, uncalled for, antagonistic, and negative message you sent in that last question in order to better explain the language I used a little further up this thread since you seemed to be very confused based on your response.\n  \n  Please take the time to read these  peer-reviewed scientific articles based on medical data before continuing to spout off at the mouth and attack others over things you clearly have done no research on and have no understanding of. These are not from any kind of news sources or \u201ccelebrity Instagram stories\u201d as you\u2019ve previously suggested. So much misinformation is out there! I truly hope you can begin to sort through what is fact and what is a misconception.\n  \n  Coronavirus Facts vs. Fiction from John\u2019s Hopkins Medical Institute:\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/health\/conditions-and-diseases\/coronavirus\/2019-novel-coronavirus-myth-versus-fact\n  \n\n  A link to ~267,000 peer reviewed scientific articles (unaffiliated with any government or news source) about every aspect of COVID-19:\n  \n\n   https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C47&q=coronavirus+infection&oq=coronavirus+\n  \n\n  How EXACTLY do face masks slow and prevent the spread of corona (with more internal links for even more specifics) from the University of California:\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.ucsf.edu\/news\/2020\/06\/417906\/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent\n  \n\n  Current Coronavirus Disease Situation Report from the World Health Organization:\n  \n\n   https:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/bitstream\/handle\/10665\/333568\/nCoVsitrep20Jul2020-eng.pdf\n  \n\n  Protecting Equines from COVID-19, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri:\n  \n\n   https:\/\/cvm.missouri.edu\/coronavirus-disease-in-horses-is-different-to-humans\/\n  \n\n  If you don\u2019t choose to read any of this, which I don\u2019t think you will tbh, at least know the info is out there.

Medicine, sanitation, social equality for women and minorities, and freedom of speech & religion weren\u2019t a thing. I\u2019d have probably died of overheating from woolen clothes in the summer, the flu, childbirth, in a farming accident, or of infection.\n  ","230603":"\n  You send me this once an hour\n  \n  HI ALREADY \ud83d\ude16\n  ","230604":"\n  Haha to each their own\n  ","230605":"\n  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n  ","230606":"\n  They\u2019re thinner and crispier!

Lots of countryside there, not a lot of giant cities, so it was relatively cheap. Plus I was having a tough time fitting in since I didn\u2019t understand the language and I was a shy kid who liked animals anyways so my mom signed me up to see if I could make friends. Stuck with it ever since!\n  ","230618":"\n  My boys \ud83e\udd70\n  ","230619":"\n  I tried a bunch of sports over the years but the only one I ever really appreciated or was any good at is equestrian!
