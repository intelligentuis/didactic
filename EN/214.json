case by case","198165":"yes , i wanted a way to use old perkins concepts","198166":"those are usually done by cn consumer products","198167":"tastes like dolphin","198168":"i met charles nelson reilly after seeing his one man show","198169":"they could have made one of those little sd figures of him","198170":"yes","198171":"i suppose he does look like a minion . when i did my concepts for him they told me he was a demon , not a gremlin . and they didn t mention his powers","198172":"oh that s awesome","198173":"they aren t white walkers !","198174":"huh ?","198175":"well we had done episodes , i was ready for a break or something new","198176":"i don t care either way","198177":"we had more ideas","198178":"nope","198179":"he won t . omniverse is over","198180":"i think most can be described using the finale titles","198181":"no","198182":"no","198183":"you can keep asking that over and over but it s not going to make any more sense than the first time","198184":"no . i have released tons of artwork","198185":"so what ? there are many examples of them using powers incorrectly","198186":"it s crude yet funny","198187":"i don t know what you mean , and we didn t do her as anodite","198188":"tom perkins drew him with a few notes from me . we just put things where they made sense , could be functional , and look cool","198189":"no","198190":"because he did","198191":"no","198192":"blood","198193":"no","198194":"i just answered that","198195":"i don t remember that one","198196":"wow","198197":"do you think if fools gold was done in the original series it would have been really funny ?","198198":"i don t think so","198199":"no","198200":"it would be nice if you actually read my answers instead of asking needless follow ups","198201":"i think steven and chap did look back at their concepts when they redesigned their aliens","198202":"i thought it was maybe because it was a little naked man","198203":"yeah i think he came out great","198204":"and his name is zoidberg","198205":"what are you talking about ? just look at it ! use your eyes this time . they remove the characters from the backgrounds in the crudest way that wrecks their outlines . just leave it on the backgrounds !","198206":"lol","198207":"not that i remember . bandai said they didn t want to make a jury rigg figure , but i guess they liked ours better since they ended up making him after all","198208":"you want to wait until april ?","198209":"yes","198210":"because he didn t want to , and we had a enough designers we didn t need him","198211":"probably not anytime soon","198212":"argit","198213":"what does that mean ?","198214":"i had watched the original series and a lot of uaf , and collected the bandai toys . youngberg and i would sometimes talk about what we would do if we ever got to work on it years before we ever did . we still did go back and watch episodes for research sometimes","198215":"usually i like to do the opposite and let the actor s voice inspire the design . i like to draw during the records . once in a while it goes the other way . i did have blukic driba s voices already in mind after i drew them .","198216":"no","198217":"it wasn t because he wasn t a fan favorite , it s because his toys didn t sell","198218":"it was my idea that he could be a cerebrocrustacean because they didn t want us using brainstorm . youngberg named him . and he s my design","198219":"they had some roughs for bloxx i made notes on , i just changed the head . i think it was my idea to have gravattack fold up into a planet . feedback i had dave johnson to design so he would look more like an original series alien","198220":"yes","198221":"i can t think of anything lately","198222":"no , i wasn t named after jerry","198223":"yes probably","198224":"well that would be me because i was involved in casting too . so i d be asking myself . but i m not in sag","198225":"probably the original series","198226":"wow i don t remember that one at all","198227":"i draw way too slow to do comix , i m just not cut out for it . the stunticon comic drawn by marcelo matere is a great comic done in my style though ! i highly recommend . i consider it canon too as marty isenberg wrote it","198228":"well the one guy was supposed to die ! youngberg had to re edit it so he didn t because cn all the sudden at the last second decided they didn t want anyone dying","198229":"their original idea went through many stages of development with different creators","198230":"yes , if ben learns how","198231":"uh , maybe you should reread it","198232":"he absorbed and destroyed him","198233":"i ll see what i can do","198234":"dad get out of my ask . fm you re embarrassing me in front of the fans !","198235":"ah yes ! claire danes !","198236":"ooh , what was this in ? beedle ?","198237":"ben had used rath so many times that his brain became infected with appoplexian emotions and ultra violent impulses that his human mind could not handle , resulting in ben not being able to control his actions . just kidding , i have no idea !","198238":"his opinions are only canon to the reboot . you d have to ask alex soto if that was true for the original continuity","198239":"gosh i d have to watch every episode ever over again to figure that out .","198240":"nope","198241":"why are they wasting time doing that ?","198242":"i like them both a lot , but some of uaf is a bit too watered down . it wasn t murakami enough for me at times . i like that there are distinct different eras . johnson , perkins , murakami wong","198243":"i would look at some good reference . like eeyore and nestor . i d definitely look at brianne drouhard s art . make sure you get good solid underdrawing before you add the details","198244":"glen and dwayne came up with the concept of khyber and the nemetrix . maybe malware too ? basically the first omniverse arc . youngberg , matt wayne , and charlotte fullerton started working on omniverse before i came on while i was still on scooby so i m not clear on all the details of that time","198245":"i think that was just the idea to have an all new batch of aliens and not use any originals","198246":"they don t need them , they just do an incantation or something and the tats appear","198247":"i don t know","198248":"does he ?","198249":"like uaf","198250":"no","198251":"if he was in omniverse i d probably make him green !","198252":"it s not canon , and my understanding is the live action shows were never mean to be considered the same canon as the cartoons","198253":"you can t tell me what to do , you re not my dad !","198254":"oh , who was that ? i can t remember","198255":"nobody ever brought it up","198256":"sorry , misread the question . yes , cn was always trying to get them to go more in that direction , and omniverse was always meant to be a course correction","198257":"well that explains it","198258":"well he would have to be able to take it apart faster than ddd s pit crew could put it back together","198259":"what ?","198260":"no","198261":"no","198262":"well thank you . i m not sure how to answer that one . a lot of it is just opinions and people s taste . but the credit should mostly go to matt youngberg , he would rewrite parts of the scripts himself , which most producers don t do . omniverse s story breaks were also generally really fun to do . we had tons of ideas and enjoyed putting them into the stories . i think glen and dwayne not being as big of fans of the original series as us hurt them too . and they were always butting heads with cn which probably made their jobs less fun and translated into the stories being less enjoyable","198263":"it seems possible","198264":"sure","198265":"what ?","198266":"it s even in the wiki , come on","198267":"there were a few people on twitter that said they d be bummed out if they didn t get rex","198268":"the ecto could have been much cooler . it should have had some of the iconic parts of the vehicle be prominent in the robot mode . his first head is really boring too .","198269":"they just look like that style of goggles . it s not a reference to gizmo","198270":"i m not sure","198271":"what ? no","198272":"no","198273":"vampires","198274":"no","198275":"production of omniverse ? it would have been the same as the others . uaf part","198276":"no clue","198277":"sounds like a tumor","198278":"yes , i wouldn t do it if i didn t mostly like it .","198279":"neither .","198280":"yes , dumb ass . it means i answered it and i answered it only hours before you asked again","198281":"a poor understanding of his character and a disinterest in the original series led to his uaf appearance","198282":"nice !","198283":"who knows","198284":"no , everyone stems from ma","198285":"the war seems to change every time he tells a story","198286":"that s tough . probably either blukic or driba or the galvan soldier","198287":"i think they re a great idea in theory , but the execution is usually sub par","198288":"i think splitting glen murakami s job into two jobs where youngberg could focus on the writing , storyboarding and animation , and i could focus on the art direction , preproduction art and the toys helped a lot . plus youngberg and my priorities were much different than the uaf priorities . matt and i really wanted to world build and get a more dynamic anime type of animation , which is what we like .","198289":"i m not sure , some people still want him","198290":"huh ? in what way ?","198291":"i remember a little old lady in a rocking chair","198292":"i think it was an ilm shirt","198293":"i don t think he spoke","198294":"unfortunately i only have triple d in night colors","198295":"bushido was designed by jon suzuki . i wish they had made a toy","198296":"oops this reply is too late but here s a fistrick brand chicken astronaut","198297":"i don t think we even knew about those aliens at the time","198298":"tanner johnson is the nicest person i ve ever met","198299":"no , unfortunately i have very few legion models","198300":"upchuck would be a closer resemblance","198301":"i drew him before ?","198302":"did you read it at all ? how was it if you did ?","198303":"he s convalescing from his psychosomatic war wounds","198304":"no , i was in house at cn when i did designs for the attea episode , but i was back at wb during ultimate","198305":"i didn t work on any games","198306":"i wish i thought of that !","198307":"dyemooch ! josh perez","198308":"it s just a name","198309":"it s got to be the ultimates , they were more detailed than a lot of other designs","198310":"no , definitely not . and it was the same people working on it","198311":"didn t weismann do a comic of his version of season ?","198312":"are they good questions ?","198313":"i don t know them","198314":"i think that s a great choice","198315":"or just a straight up dilophosaurus","198316":"it s possible that a squid kraken also exists","198317":"omniverse arms is based on my concepts but i can t remember who did the final model . idk who did the uaf one","198318":"don t be a douche","198319":"lol , even chris o donnel is a better designed robin","198320":"different","198321":"wow . try reading the answers sometimes","198322":"you can do google searches and sometimes find online stores that still sell omniverse , especially european stores . you might want to ask guardabarranco collections on instagram if you are looking for something that s hard to find . he s hooked me up with some really rare stuff . other than that it s just ebay and mercari","198323":"garage finds are the best","198324":"it keeps going because it gets better ratings than the other stuff on cn . why i don t know","198325":"some might be soft canon . comic adaptations always try to overstep their boundaries and introduce characters that you know will turn up in later seasons of the show and be completely different the only comics that are full canon are the transformers animated the arrival comics , because marty isenberg actually wrote them","198326":"except it s a porta potty instead of a phone box","198327":"yes , i ve only seen the comics","198328":"not in my sketchbooks","198329":"these were all taken from undertown aliens drawn by steven and chap . i think i came up with pesky s name","198330":"yep","198331":"the ideas for bloxx , gravattack , and feedback were already started when i came onboard . whampire is mine","198332":"no , yes , yes","198333":"just the first season , i keep meaning to watch it since it s been on disney","198334":"yes , no , maybe i can t remember","198335":"it was a temp name that nobody really wanted to use","198336":"i don t know , does he seem like he does ?","198337":"sublimino , xylene , cooper","198338":"i don t speak that language","198339":"true , but he probably does that with everyone !","198340":"that would be a pretty dumb idea","198341":"no they are spells","198342":"they want a cracker","198343":"go ! robin probably . i think i like all the rest","198344":"i have no idea","198345":"they are part of vladats","198346":"that would have been cool . i tried really hard to get them to make an argit . maybe a good accessory would have sold him","198347":"sure maybe . but i usually prefer to do more stuff i haven t done before","198348":"it s style guide art for merchandise","198349":"i just don t have ideas for casting everybody","198350":"there can be more than one samurai or pirate","198351":"probably","198352":"please ask this question more times","198353":"there are so many good ones in the main line , the bens , frankenstrike and the halloween aliens , nrg . i was disappointed in tyrannopede , he s so small and in a weird pose","198354":"whoever he wants to","198355":"lol","198356":"guess","198357":"oh dear","198358":"the problem is that the animated toys were so much bigger than the current toys , so they wouldn t be scaled the same","198359":"maybe brainstorm or jhiaxus","198360":"i don t know that they ve ever been in contact","198361":"running around the castle","198362":"no","198363":"no","198364":"the name sounds vaguely familiar","198365":"yes","198366":"i have no idea","198367":"oh . just because what would it be ?","198368":"no , not really . i don t do as many concepts as perkins and my false starts are just loose scribbles","198369":"if he thinks of it","198370":"what ?","198371":"under your bed or in storage in your garage","198372":"a fight ?","198373":"what ? ?","198374":"already answered","198375":"dou did these concepts after i sent her my roughs . i would have liked to have used a few more of these outfits","198376":"hm , maybe i mistook the character . i don t remember . but shakeh was only there part of first season .","198377":"burn ask . fm to the ground","198378":"ha !","198379":"spoilers !","198380":"no , i ll probably do the gauntlet","198381":"i get the impression they didn t know each other . he was probably in the null void when the earth plumbers were merged with the space police force","198382":"it s hard to remember now , i couldn t keep shakeh on the show for too long . i think she designed the little human girl , madison and probably other kraaho . she didn t do verdona , i think that was dou hong based on my roughs","198383":"told in pop ups , i think","198384":"i regret not getting to do a few characters and i regret we didn t get to bring back fred tatasciore at least for a new role","198385":"i was really excited . excited enough about it to leave scooby before it was finished .","198386":"omnitrix uniform clothes","198387":"jerry is still searching for that special somebody","198388":"watch the show","198389":"nope","198390":"prefer it to what ?","198391":"those dou hong early concepts ?","198392":"d . alien","198393":"maybe i can make him thinner like that","198394":"the , volt ghost . yes , a little","198395":"nah probably not","198396":"oh , no . i thought there was one in brazil","198397":"i don t remember kroll ?","198398":"why ?","198399":"from scratch","198400":"sure","198401":"depends on what mood i m in","198402":"yes","198403":"there wasn t a formula to it , it was different each time","198404":"he only knows about the reboot , not the classic continuity","198405":"huh ?","198406":"no . after rex","198407":"i made a big pot of soup once but left the burner up too high for too long and burnt all the stuff on the bottom which made everything taste burnt and i had to throw it all out","198408":"sure why not ?","198409":"watch the show","198410":"nope","198411":"it s a good one","198412":"for me , yes . i like the songs in rocky horror but don t really like the movie much","198413":"ha ! doubtful","198414":"not really","198415":"soft canon","198416":"i m just doing freelance stuff at the moment , nothing big yet","198417":"who s going to stop me ?","198418":"nope","198419":"nothing magical","198420":"no","198421":"no . he wasn t involved so he wasn t privy to any of our concepts .","198422":"here or instagram probably","198423":"love zim","198424":"you mean pretty looking with a boring story ?","198425":"like the sound of rocks scraping together and the sound of wet noodles","198426":"welcome to ask . fm","198427":"what kind of question is this even ? terrible","198428":"because he wasn t meant to be used outside of water","198429":"definitely canon","198430":"no , sorry . i definitely couldn t use any names the fans come up with","198431":"spanner traveling to the past had nothing to do with his future parents relationship","198432":"i don t know either of those people","198433":"like peppermint larry","198434":"i don t think it ever came up","198435":"why is this even a question ?","198436":"there is no king","198437":"finally a decent question","198438":"no , i m not a writer and i didn t ever want to write for the show . matt wayne asked me if i did once , but i m a drawer . i m very happy coming up with the ideas and elements of a story for the writers to turn into a script","198439":"fan theories on the wiki not based on any facts spread like stds","198440":"or she created her own reality ? i really don t know","198441":"something changes in him obviously","198442":"just the ones that have already been shown","198443":"i don t know what ultimate kevin is","198444":"no","198445":"no","198446":"no","198447":"no","198448":"guinea pigs","198449":"good","198450":"no , i wouldn t change anything","198451":"no , ben and julie never seemed to have much chemistry or a very good relationship . people who dated when they were don t usually end up together","198452":"i don t remember","198453":"did you ever see anything like that in the show ?","198454":"nothing much so far but i m hoping to get back to him soon","198455":"yes , i love paul williams","198456":"if he could manage to figure out the omnitrix timer he could be really good at espionage","198457":"yes , it s just tanner with a white beard","198458":"jabba and palpatine","198459":"i don t think sound waves kill venom , just destabilize him","198460":"are there realities where ben is not lazy enough and has the focus to become a ninja ? seems unlikely","198461":"from wwe wwf , yes","198462":"i don t know if i d want to do another whole series","198463":"great but so short !","198464":"no , i think he likes it","198465":"i appreciate that , thank you . i do save questions sometimes because i have to give them thought , but questions i save also get buried and i can t find them all the time when i go back to look . but this i already answered this guy s questions anyway . they just weren t getting the answer they wanted","198466":"i like to hear people s favorite characters , but sometimes there s a weird obsession that is just too much . and these type of guys will only accept the answer they already have mind anyway","198467":"depends on the planet and species","198468":"what would be the point if it didn t ?","198469":"no , that was probably an animation error or the wrong fx model got sent to the animation studio","198470":"you send me each of your already redundant questions literally times , yes i m going to be rude to you","198471":"we get it , you like rojo . now move on","198472":"no","198473":"nope","198474":"same","198475":"better let me tell you what s omniverse style","198476":"almost nothing is known about atomix","198477":"missing the obvious ?","198478":"beaker and skeksil the chamberlain","198479":"they are not known for their fancy footwork no feet","198480":"probably","198481":"now i want an mcu villain to sing","198482":"unlikely","198483":"i don t like camping and i ve been","198484":"already did one","198485":"no i don t believe so","198486":"porta potty and nothing","198487":"no","198488":"no and very unlikely","198489":"i don t know which one that is . the games are probably soft canon","198490":"probably not . i d give it to steven to do","198491":"similar to the original series playlist","198492":"oof . next time maybe stick to our universe","198493":"i doubt it","198494":"i m not sure if you noticed or not , but we changed all the designs . it was a new show","198495":"wtf ? ?","198496":"https youtu . be bd vnhmocgo","198497":"they are clockwork mounts","198498":"i don t know","198499":"i

good one","198507":"there may be realities where the omnitrix user is not human but ben is probably always human","198508":"ask perkins","198509":"probably one of the things yes","198510":"they do indeed !","198511":"no it isn t","198512":"another weird idea treated as fact by the fandom","198513":"i think so","198514":"is it something that exists anywhere ?","198515":"in omniverse it s members only","198516":"i don t remember him using a code to unlock anything just a code for the lifeform lock","198517":"same as what happens in the episode","198518":"things that don t evolve go extinct","198519":"most times it seems like the transformation lasts for around minutes , but the timer is also random","198520":"i have friends who play it but i always prefer rankin bass orcs","198521":"in what way ?","198522":"not that i know of","198523":"it s not something i d considered previously","198524":"i thought that was common knowledge","198525":"maybe in a reality he wrote","198526":"yes","198527":"what ?","198528":"it s not on my to do list currently","198529":"he wasn t ever depicted earlier , but i like perkins version","198530":"smoothies are not ice cream . shakes are made from ice cream , smoothies are blended fruit","198531":"yes , people at a convention are usually happy to be there and very friendly","198532":"you realize toepick is ben , don t you ?","198533":"no , we never got that far . just nobody liked the name","198534":"hm , i don t think so","198535":"i don t think mine was a big enough evolution compared to the others they came up with","198536":"i m not sure , maybe parts of it . i d probably have steven do it . i just wouldn t have uwm talk","198537":"not as far as i know","198538":"his mom drives it","198539":"it s almost like imdb doesn t exist","198540":"ball weevils aren t from the same world as the worsts originally , but many immigrated there and have lived there for generations","198541":"most species eat what

think so , i can t remember who wanted to use him . i think everybody loved his design so they wanted to see more of him","198550":"looks pretty good but he s got some poor omnitrix placement","198551":"it was either in the script or the storyboard artists came up with it","198552":"probably something bad","198553":"i m not sure","198554":"yes","198555":"it depends on the character","198556":"yes","198557":"i assume he swoops over people and gasses them","198558":"doc oc is great . mine is jack o lantern or hobgoblin probably","198559":"i think i rewatch scooby the most , at least right now . i haven t interacted with the scooby fandom too much but the ones i have talked to seem nice . and the unmasked podcast interview i did was fun . interacting with transformers fans at conventions and doing tf podcasts was also fun . i ve only ever really interacted with ben fans online","198560":"no and no","198561":"he could probably light something so it looks a certain color but once his light was off the color would go back to normal","198562":"no they were insistent they meant strawberries , so i don t know wtf they re talking

main cast , but some that were specifically mine were azmuth , fistina , luhley , kuphulu , bezel , and charles zenith . youngberg had met jon heder before and i had always wanted him to exploit that connection and try to get him as a guest star","198773":"yes","198774":"not that i can think of","198775":"i don t know what those are","198776":"yes , i was involved in casting and some of the

design","198822":"lol","198823":"yes","198824":"watch the show","198825":"i do . i played the old versions a little in arcades , i ve seen the first movie , and i have some of the gi joe mk figures","198826":"there aren t rules for making a request","198827":"nope","198828":"possibly but it seems like it would be very difficult and you could only use the skin where it s thin enough to be

pyronites just to see how we could have varied them","198838":"yeah , that sucks . they need a kevin feige or john favreau . a creative leader with good taste and good sense of story . then reboot everything and don t take anything from bayformers .","198839":"it doesn t seem like it","198840":"who knows what happens in the future ?","198841":"it seems unlikely","198842":"not

alien x questions i get","198852":"nope","198853":"i ve heard the story is good but it still looks too much like bayformers for me to want to watch it . i wish it had been a full reboot","198854":"that has literally never happened since i started answering ben questions . there are always bad questions for every good one","198855":"possibly","198856":"this question has been
