I was inlove with him but he didnt feel the same way about me anymore and he moved on while I was still holding onto something that wasnt meant to be. And I'm glad he found someone who he loves and they love him back. Eventually I'll find my forever person or someone who I love just as much and get the same respect and that back. Somethings just aren't meant to be or isnt the right time and I think for me and tristen although I loved him it just wasnt the right time or place and who knows what may happen in the future. I have no hard feelings towards him at all and wish him the best. But right now I'm focused on myself. My career and doing what I want to and having a path I want to follow along.

She would sometimes give us the stuff dedicated to us or for us. But kath sometimes forgets to do so or things change and we just forget about it or it becomes to much that we cant always get to it right away. I dont know if anyone checks it anymore tbh as we are all assigned to do certain roles that  fit our personality  and our strengths and so on. I apologize if the gift was returned but if you ACTUALLY  want your gift to get to amy I would wait and save it until we are able to do shows or something or travel and so on to places and try to get into one of those events or whatever to actually see amy face to face and know she received it. Because anything we get from mert and greets and so on we have to take home and 99% of the time if its something we really enjoy or can wear and use or whatever we keep it and then decide what we can like donate and so on\n  ","901266":"\n  People are just desperate to get attention anymore\n  ","901267":"\n  Thank you\n  "}}
