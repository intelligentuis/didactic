michael our oldest brother and the oldest child of my siblings was young our mom , found an interview where a year old girl was talking about college and how she was just soaring and excelling . my mom was fascinated by her story , but was a bit wary of the idea because homeschooling wasn t very common at the time in the early s . my mom however went to public schools and did not enjoy her experience at all . due to bullying , and skipping grades she would sometimes be bored and waiting for the lecture to be over with . so she wanted us to advance at our own pace instead of being rushed or forced . and be able to skip grades if that was what was best for us . her and dad decided to home school all of us from k and developed their own curriculum which focused on latin , greek , classic literature , catholic faith and critical thinking . mom wanted us to have to learn to think for ourselves , to be curious and love learning , and to have strong moral compasses . she signed us up for every activity possible in our area swim team , musical theatre , basketball , gymnastics , boy scouts and girl scouts , karate , and many more . we all grew up to be a loud , vibrant bunch . we were very well socialized and had a lot of friends . most people didn t guess we were homeschooled when they met us because of our social and people skills . to this day , we all count our homeschool experience as one of the greatest tools in our lives and careers . because of homeschooling , we have had a lot of free time to learn instruments , practice singing and harmonizing , and write songs . homeschooling gave us the space to be free to be ourselves . being unique and independent was highly valued in the cimorelli household we were not told to fit into the mold . this ideal
