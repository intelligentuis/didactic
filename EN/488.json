They are either juicy from the gym or on their period at times. They are 30\/40s, both married and don't have kids yet. Maybe they took my \"fun\" out of context..

Aint nobody wants to get injured over silly mistakes.\n  \n  eating the right foods\/macros. I focus more on protein and fat content. I try limiting my carb intake but nothing too crazy either! Counting every calorie can get unhealthy though.\n  \n  obviously sticking with it over time helps\n  \n  could even change up the workouts to keep your body guessing. I change up the order of what I feel like doing\n  \n  i like starting with cardio and then moving on to the fun stuff.\n  \n  I'm not sure what else to say currently. I feel like they kind of go together with me. My legs and butt bounce back super quickly and then other areas take more time :\/ my shoulders seem to get better fast too but arms not so soon.\n  \n  supplements can help but i wouldn't be codependent on them. doing the work is where the results come from.\n  ","524606":"\n  I guess\n  ","524607":"\n  I like it.

It's more the connection and attraction for me than race would ever factor in. Especially since my sister-in-law, her family and my nephews have Guatemalan in them.\n  ","524615":"\n  This doesn't totally count but I walked by this guy when I was leaving the gym and he said \"god bless\" which was a bit creepy. I'm not religious. I'm not sure if he noticed my 1stphorm shirt and was saying it in that way because he knew the company. Trying to flirt or what. I said \"you too\" though and kept walking lol. Kind of hard to see what he looked like since it was dark out but I got hispanic vibes from his voice.
