messing up in a relationship but end up coming on too strong or controlling without realizing . other times it could be that it s in their nature to be a certain way like always honest and to some they don t want to hear the truth when it s about things that may make them feel insecure so it comes off as being toxic . when people are hateful or toxic the reasons varies with perspective as well because there are always two sides to every story and even then sometimes you d need a third person that sees both sides from an entirely different perspective . there s no need to be hateful but it happens whether it s on purpose out of spite , jealousy or strong emotions like anger which they may later regret when they re calm . all in all , it happens for different reasons like little triggers , past experiences , characteristics , etc .","143977":"i would collect little figurines or trinkets from films n shows i like","143978":"well now someone s asked you","143979":"answering
