One of her beliefs is that there's \"no such thing\" as bi people, you're either gay or straight. So for years I dealt with that internally- feeling like my attractions to all genders didn't really exist or was all in my head. It wasn't until I removed her from my life permanently and started intensive therapy to find myself separate from her abuse that I came out. I've always BEEN bi, I just didn't admit it until later on. And being in a monogamous relationship doesn't mean that you don't have crushes or don't have weird sex dreams about others? Your personal sexuality is yours no matter what your dating or marriage situation is. I'm mostly attracted to women. I have only dated men.

Like you do know you look like a total asshole right? NO ONE ON THIS SITE hates me like you do and over what. Over me getting questions on a website designed around answering questions?

Literally 2 hours or less later. I report Ben when he gets especially out of hand. I report him probably as much or more than anyone here. But when I block him, which I have, he's back immediately.\n  \n  He does this because I am a preferred target. Just like I am your preferred target. You're not going for Ben, you're coming for me.

And to be honest, I have blocked Ben. Like everyone else on this entire site, I started blocking Ben when he first reared his racist head.

Kind of like why you're still on my shit about it. I've blocked you before too and look where we are now.\n  \n  I get that you're jealous. You're an anon shitbag and no one ever asks you anything.

My favorite historical art movement is probably the expressionist era. Between the world wars, Europe just sort of exploded with new creative and expressive styles- impressionism, german expressionism, surrealism, dada, etc.- and it brought art into a whole different direction in the West.

I don't really deal with that much now on meds, just an occasional voice or like, a quick attachment to a weird idea that passes.

I realize that's about worthless (I mean, like all of us, I started off just blocking Ben but he literally has a new account every day lately so there's really no point at all) but it's there as an option and some people aren't as determined as he is.\n  \n  So TL:DR- is their intent to attack me or is their intent to waste my time?

My docs keep insisting that as time passes things will get back to normal. It's been like, 2 years though. I've tried unsuccessfully to get my husband to sleep with other people but he's determined to be mono and with my non-sexual self.

I've since drank a billion cups of coffee, smoked too much weed, cleaned dishes, run the clothes dryer, and eaten lunch (cheese and crackers). I also fed the scrub jays outside and visited with my parakeet about 6-7 times. It's now 5 past noon and the rest of my day looks boring as hell\n  ","166885":"\n  I've had one doctor offer them but not normally because you have to listen for instructions while in there like when to breathe and what to move\n  ","166886":"\n  CT takes less time since it's just xrays essentially. MRIs are more advanced\/use magnets\/are louder\n  ","166887":"\n  no I deserve cookies\n  ","166888":"\n  they throw you in a big circular imaging tube, on a cot that moves. You have to stay incredibly still and hold your breath when they tell you to. A voice screams at you through a speaker in the tube. Sometimes they want to do a intravenous dye that makes you feel like you pissed your pants when it hits your veins. It's all very loud and uncomfortable but it's mostly a quick procedure and painless.\n  ","166889":"\n  I don't enjoy talking about the abusive parts of my past or sexual things so I guess those.\n  ","166890":"\n  I've had both, on several parts of my body\n  ","166891":"\n  no, my attendance was terrible. I was always sick as a kid. Then in highschool my family moved to another state and left me behind my senior year because I was 18. So I skipped all the time because I didn't have a family for the school to report it to and my teachers all felt sorry for me. I had already been accepted to my first pick college though so school was sort of pointless at that point.\n  ","166892":"\n  I only got detention twice. Once was for talking back to a teacher and once was for fighting with some kid who was bullying my little sister\n  ","166893":"\n  I met my two best friends through games.

So even if I've been pissed off, it's passed pretty quickly. I am mad that I'm out of coffee this morning but I'm also aware that that's a stupid reason to be mad. I'm mad that one of you keeps using my sarahah to bully me and be ridiculous and childish but at the same time I have better things to worry about. I think it's the beta blockers- I take them for panic disorder to keep my adrenaline from overproducing and since then I sort of just don't get that mad for long.\n  ","166896":"\n  there was a painting by Oskar Kokoschka called \"Two Nudes (Lovers)\" in the Boston Museum of Art that touched me so much when I saw it at the time that it made me cry. I have reacted to seeing many paintings or sculptures in person but that was the strongest reaction I have felt because of art and it was memorable\n  ","166897":"\n  k\n  ","166898":"\n  maybe true. You definitely are bad.\n  ","166899":"\n  I didn't say it wasn't I was just saying that you using them as an example makes no sense. American whites are almost as bad at brits\n  ","166900":"\n  it's discriminatory but not racist you can't be racist against the race that's doing the oppressing\n  ","166901":"\n  native americans didn't oppress any other peoples. They are pushed off into reservations at a fraction of what land they had before. England has done nothing but oppress other cultures. So it is wrong to want to continue to do so. Forcing all white areas and segregation so you can have \"your land for your people\" oppresses millions.\n  ","166902":"\n  Yeah I think certain outside forces can make someone change how they interact with people. Like, I was quite extroverted in high school but after schizophrenia took over I became much more introverted. I was introverted as a small child as well. I would say I'm introverted now and have been since I was 19 but I was definitely outgoing and thrived on company when I was a teen.\n  ","166903":"\n  as long as you're aware that you're the worst.\n  ","166904":"\n  still racist. You need to accept that you're racist.\n  ","166905":"\n  and yet you're still here, sending me garbage\n  ","166906":"\n  yes, it's racist. Furthermore, I've slept with a black dude so probably you should avoid me\n  ","166907":"\n  I thought you tell everyone you're not racist, just misogynist and xenophobic. Like why are you filling my inbox with this racist nonsense.\n  ","166908":"\n  this is a weird homework question\n  ","166909":"\n  I mean, it felt like that at the time of breakup but I got over it\n  ","166910":"\n  I'm out of coffee so I have to make do with this cup of english breakfast tea :(\n  ","166911":"\n  health care\n  ","166912":"\n  I have some good online friends for sure.\n  ","166913":"\n  I don't know any other schizophrenics in real life though I've met a few online. All of our delusions have been different.\n  ","166914":"\n  when I was unmedicated, I had certain auditory delusions and some hallucinations, yes. Mostly I just believed big conspiracy type things (for me it was omens? that mixed with OCD made for interesting times because I had so many rituals and superstitions about everything.) Now I still exhibit some of the negative symptoms of my disease (depression, social withdrawal, agoraphobia, etc) I haven't had any psychotic features in years. I take a lot of meds and see my doctors as often as recommended.\n  ","166915":"\n  not really. I probably would have been classified as such as a teen but I tend to live and let live now, without a lot of overthinking.\n  ","166916":"\n  what a shitty thing to ask someone randomly lol. At least word it nicer. You come across as completely ableist.\n  \n  I have always suffered from some form of anxiety. I've had cptsd since childhood, and I was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 19.\n  ","166917":"\n  I'm fine?\n  ","166918":"\n  if I had it wouldn't make me hate everyone of their gender?? Like, my mom was super abusive but I don't hate all moms. It's not healthy bruh.\n  ","166919":"\n  yes I've heard some of them they're all pretty bullshit everyone gets hurt and everyone gets disappointed and not everyone acts the way they should act but the rest of us don't hate entire groups of people over what is essentially just life.\n  ","166920":"\n  it's not normal to hate the way you do. At all.\n  ","166921":"\n  if you don't accept my answer then stop asking me questions? What does this have to do with anything?\n  ","166922":"\n  but that's not what you asked at all is it\n  ","166923":"\n  no, Ben, you're not normal.\n  ","166924":"\n  I need to have better control over my willingness to participate in financial conversations with my husband. It's something I pay little attention to and I know it bothers him. I just don't react well to numbers and budgets and while I don't spend a lot, that's not the issue, I really just don't ever remember to for instance enter in a total in the online budget sheet, or save a receipt to go over totals later or any of those sort of things. I should be in more control of our finances but I'm too uninterested and bad at it.\n  ","166925":"\n  my favorite musician entertainers are Grimes, Beck, the Pixies, St Vincent, Ramona Lisa, Absofacto, Von Sell, Missy Elliott and Kreayshawn\n  \n  I don't really have any favorite comedians\n  \n  Actors?

Of the 10 men she's met she only let ONE pet her- and that was some teen kid who was friends of my friend's kid who helped us move. She lets the woman vet, all of the ladies at the bird store, my stepmom, and me of course pet her though so lots of women.\n  ","166972":"\n  My grandfathers were both servicemen and two out of my five nephews served (one is still in the Army). So I have some degree of respect for what they do because they're my family and I love them. However, I think it becomes almost hero worship in some cases in America with the military. Meanwhile so many vets develop mental illnesses while serving and get pushed aside and treated like bums. So I wish if we were going to elevate the status of some military people we ought to have better mental health care for veterans\n  ","166973":"\n  you're generalizing again and it's really yucky.

Not to mention that was going on when gamergate was happening so I just sort of lost interest in games. I still play something sometimes, I was a fan of pokemon go when it came out and I played firewatch and kentucky route zero last year but like I tried to pick up skyrim again not long ago and I was just so bored with it.
