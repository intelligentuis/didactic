Anything can happen.\n  ","31317":"\n  Don't be selfless\n  ","31318":"\n  If you gargle hydrogen peroxide do not eat for 30 minutes after. And if you gargle it at night I wouldn't even drink anything after. Let it sit. After you gargle it do not put any water in your mouth at all. You can wipe your mouth. Just look at the dentist don't put any water in your mouth. Let it sit in your mouth and your throat. What the hydrogen peroxide does is it attacks the acids that are in your throat that are causing you a sore throat and if you actually do this right away when you start realizing you have a sore throat it can actually make it go away faster because you're handling the acids before they make you have a severe sore throat. It creates a scab in the back of your throat that's why you don't want to continuously do it too much because then you will irritate the throat. Just like if you were to cut your leg you want a scab if you keep messing with the scab and putting alcohol on it you will just irritated. That's why I said don't exceed more than three times a day. This is what I was told also when I was doing it.\n  \n  And honestly if you have a sore throat you really honestly only have to do this for 2 days the gargling. It should go away after that. It's just start showing change.\n  \n  If it doesn't help then that means you were too late when you started gargling and or it might be something different other than a sore throat.\n  \n  Again good luck\n  ","31319":"\n  Continuation\n  \n  If your throat is severely hurting. Get you some mint mouthwash. Take two oz and pour it into a cup. Then get you some hydrogen peroxide and then pour about 1 oz into the same cup mix it up real well make sure that the liquids or warm if you have to get you some really warm water and add 2 oz of that as well before adding the hydrogen peroxide and the mouthwash. You want the liquid to be warm it will really make your throat feel good. Take you some salt and shake it into the cup then gargle it three times. I would only do this if you are a certain age because you do not need to swallow it. Do not swallow hydrogen peroxide but if you read the bottle you can gargle it and it will help with sore throat. You do this about twice a day. After you wake up in the morning if your throat is hurting do it once. Only do it after you eat. Brush your teeth first and then do your everyday mouth washing but just add these ingredients also. Before bed I would do it again. I would not exceed more than 3 times a day doing it because it can actually worsen it if you keep doing it. But you just do it once or twice this is really good for sore throat. I personally do this and it works every time. Good luck with your sore throat and I hope that you feel better good luck with your cold.\n  \n  Now I am no doctor but these are just the things that I have used to help me get rid of a cold a sore throat or just a lot of mucus.\n  \n  I would honestly consult with your doctor before actually but it's up to you to take these ideas\n  ","31320":"\n  Depending on personal medical conditions. Usually taking Tylenol or some type of fever reducer and pain reducer helps. Helps with some of the symptoms. It helps with reducing.\n  \n  Taking some sort of a syrup for colds help. Make sure you look into what you are taking and make sure it's okay to take with Tylenol or pain reliever tablets. Also make sure the Stirrup you are allowed to take also. Just in case you have any type of medical conditions such as high blood pressure.\n  \n  Sometimes Out of Water such as Alka-Seltzer can help. Again make sure you can handle and take that before taking. Warm liquid.\n  \n  Theraflu is really good.\n  \n  Sleep and rest and taking it easy. For at least the amount of the fever lasting.. you need to let your body focused on getting better. You moving around is not letting your body focus. Your body is focused on moving more than getting better.\n  \n  Lots of liquids.\n  \n  Stay hydrated.\n  \n  More than usual.\n  \n  Warm moist air.\n  \n  Take 2 warn 15 min. showers a day. Even though your body may be seem cold it's freaking out. Stay comfortably warm. The mist from the shower will help you. Even if you cough that means it's helping. Promise. A Dr. would say the same.\n  \n  Salt water gargling depending on your symptoms of your cold of course.\n  \n  And then honestly if you have a cold I would recommend going to the doctor and getting prescribed medication to help you get better from being sick. This is the best way to cure a cold. Prescribed medications. You can also get over the counter but all it's going to do is lessen the symptoms.\n  \n  Also drinking vitamin C can help you get better.\n  \n  Change your clothes frequently throughout the day and wash your face a lot. Brush your teeth normally as you should.\n  \n  Wash face at least 2-3 times.\n  \n  If your throat hurts try warm tea a little bit of lemon and honey. Depending on your age adding a little bit of bourbon to your drink can also help.\n  \n  If your throat is severely hurting.

Especially in today's society. We are living in covid-19 ages. A pandemic. We shouldn't be doing a lot of touching of one another especially if we don't know each other and where we've been.

Getting all up in your face and just. Yeah.... No, you wouldn't like that and if you do that is just strange on so many levels.\n  \n  And see me? The minute I get physical or start telling them something... \"Oh... Well now I'm the bad kid. The bad guy.\" But if they were to say it. It would be okay. I probably am a little harsh about things.

Play sports play games talk about the old days. Swim all kinds of things. And then of course you do have your New Orleans parades that can get a little rowdy usually.

I feel that I need it for the things that I need in my life...\". and don't even go into detail about it just be like, \" I just feel like I got things I got to take care of too man..\" Even if it's 5 dollars.

I have heard of people robbing people for just that much.. It's crazy.. Sad.\n  \n  I don't borrow money from people period. And if I do I return it within a day or a week which honestly it's only a few dollars. And I still don't like to even borrow that. It to me just makes me feel a lack of independency in myself... Ya know? I always like to have my money right. If I have to sacrifice something then I will to make sure I have enough money for my bills and myself. I paid for the needs first and then the wants come second. I remember oh what do I have to pay this month? Water bill this that this that. Oh I need deodorant. I need that so I'm going to get that. I don't need a new pair of shoes if I already have a pair or two or even three. That clearly can wait. The needs are what you have to get. I make sure that I'm taking care of before asking for money.

So I'm going to respect them and not use it while I'm with a customer. But usually right after I'm done with the customer I check my messages. But I always answer friends and family. Always. If it's a random stranger or advertisement or spam message sometimes I ignore them. Even strangers are usually immediately message back. Depending on who they are. I did a lot of messages. Especially a lot of stranger messages. I have to be really careful because some of them are really strange people. Some of them asking me really sexual nasty vulgar questions. Some of them asking me just disturbing things. And some of them trying to scam me and more. That's why a lot of the times I only answer your family and friends.

That's the sight in a relationship more than a friendship. But mine was more of a friendship but again I take them as a using attention-seeking type person.\n  \n  I never really got stuck in these situations too much because the minute they started doing it I usually cut them off because I'm not gonna be their bank.\n  \n  I work hard for the things that I get in life and I work hard for my money. And I'm not about to sit there and just hands just someone that didn't do anything for it. That should be the thought that you think of. You're not a bank.

The reason why you want to have so many\/much as b\/c you would be surprised how much energy is taken from your batteries camera & lights & other electric tools that you use on your investigations. Spirits feed off of energy and electric tools that are full of energy. That's why sometimes when you're on investigations and start to feel funny that means they're feeding off of your energy. And then you start to notice shortly after a lot of activity. Spirits made energy to be able to create that activity. Usually negative spirits feed the most off of people and equipment because they're the ones that want to cause more activity and more noticing. Usually that's the case. Or a lonely or sad Spirit. Usually a negative spirits in general. So that's why you want to bring more lights because if you're out at night investigating and your camera lights go off you need to have your phone light and your phone all the way charged but sometimes your phone will die. You'll notice that your phone is at a full charge and then miraculously after a 25-minute investigation your phone is weirdly at 15% or even dead and no service for some reason. And then say for instant you bring a couple of flashlights in your backpack you go to turn one on it doesn't turn on for some odd reason the brand new batteries that you put in it's are dead. You check the next flashlight it works for 5 minutes and then dies. Then you have no lights right? So if you have the extra camera lights then you're good. Should always bring backup plans when investigating at night.\n  \n  Then batteries for your camera? Why so many? The same thing happens to your camera batteries. They will die so you need more batteries just in case if the one your camera died and another one just in case it up and dies and honestly another one at that one dies. I have seen up to four batteries died in the same 30 minute for some investigators. Backup plans\n  ","31836":"\n  I mean either one of those or any night infrared camera is good for at night ghost hunting. You don't always have to go at night either.

And of course they have night vision where you can turn off all the lights and all you can see in the camera is either a little white light or a little green light that's only seen by your viewers and the only thing you can see is through the camera to walk. And then of course the camera in general helps to see at night a lot better. You can even get a regular camera and just make sure that has night vision on it and you can buy one of those. You don't have to specifically buy one of those you listing. But of course if you I want one of those then sure. But Canon Cameras are really good.\n  \n  I recommend going to Best Buy so you can fiddle with the camera a lot before buying it. I find their service very good. Of course if you have one in the area. Regardless of covid-19 I would not buy a camera online. You are going to want to touch it and mess with it before buying it.\n  \n  You're also going to want a few lights for the camera. I would suggest getting three to four lights because your lights will get drain really easily. Always have fresh lights on you. Especially when you're out ghost hunting at night.\n  \n  Do not ever go ghost hunting by yourself. Bring at least two or three people and do not split up. This is my #1 rule with ghost hunting. You can split up into 2 groups or more, but do not ever go by yourself because you never know what could happen to you. Crazy people in the world and you could accidentally trip and hurt yourself or worse.\n  \n  When buying a camera you also want to get at least 4 to 5 batteries because battery life won't last long on cameras and if you're going to want to record all day long or long videos you're going to need lots of batteries.\n  ","31837":"\n\n   @Alicia861\n  \n\n  \u2764\n  ","31838":"\n  ???

And it's really hard to get rid of the entity especially if it's attached to you. So I definitely encourage you to be really careful when using certain tools which I'm sure you're aware of already. But with that empty being attached to you it's not a pleasant experience it can be really dangerous to not just you but the people around you so just keep that in mind. But I give you great respect in researching the Paranormal because it's a very different subject. A very touchy subject. Very controversial. A lot of Skeptics.

(I know some mechanics and how to use) but's very hard to make it and takes forever and it's really expensive. I can tell you this, there are plenty of apps that to don't require the static noise (cost like 10-15-20 bucks) and frequency noise to speak back and forth with spirits or entities. Those apps are actually legit. I made sure of it and they're actually made by paranormal teams and used by real paranormal teams and they have been proven to be real by paranormal enthusiasts. The two real apps that work are the \"Necrophonic App, and there's one other one, Dead Wave.\"\n  \n  Again, you don't have to have the static noise everytime. Old Ghost Boxes were made with the static noise radio frequency changing b\/c that was the only thing they had back when that 1st Ghost Box was made but technology has boomed over the years and now they have been able to make a real Ghost Box without the sound of white noise.\n  \n  But I do warn you when using a Ghost Box or The Wonder Box, that you can actually communicate with something that is unhuman and dangerous. You're not always talking to a spirit. You have to be really careful when using a Ghost Box or any type of communication device or object (Ouija board) b\/c you can have something really negative follow you or get connected to your house or a object of use during the communicate session aka seance. You want to be careful not conjure up something... You want to know what you're doing. You have to know the right proceedings to starting a safe and proper seance. People always get too intrigued and just jump into it too fast before searching and then they make the mistake and then they conjure something and it follows them. And it's really hard to get it off of them even with self-healing.\n  \n  So I do warn you before doing anything of the above as crazy as it sounds.

A lot of people are pretty surprised with the results.\n  \n  But are you referring to the Wonder box or the real Spirit Box? Cuz they have a static Spirit Box and then they have a Wonder box. The Wonder Box as a super duper higher class Ghost Box basically. It's literally sound waves that allow spirits to speak back and forth almost like a telephone. Trying to figure out which one you're meaning. I'm guessing you're meaning the Wonder Box. The regular static ghost box is almost like a first-level crap and goes box LOL. But Wonderbox, if your meaning that, if so yes he communicates with Spirits better than ever. With that device. The Wonder box actually takes months almost a year to make because it's so hard to make and it can be anywhere from two or three if not more thousand dollars.

I've always played video games since I was really really young like three or four or five years old. I've always loved playing video games and then when I reached the age 12 or 13 I started playing online and then when I was about 13 or 14 and got my first Xbox and then a few years down online I met all kinds of cool friends and friends like family online. And then randomly in a Lobby of Grand Theft Auto I made friends with Jason from the start. We made really good friends at the beginning and then soon after started dating met a few months later (6-7) and then kept going back and forth for a few years and then you got engaged (2018) and then a few years later we got married and now we're together and happy.

People will follow you when they see you question on my page.\n  \n  And I ask a lot of questions too. So be aware. This afternoon I'm going to be sending out a lot of questions.\n  \n  My advice to you is don't let people troll you on here. There are people on here that are on here specifically just for that. There are people on here to ask you super personal questions and judge you for them and make fun of you. I would probably not put your mental health issues on here either... Or just be careful about that subject. Some trolls will make fun of you about them. (If you have any issues of course I wouldn't know) Me just saying that for you to look out for you... Warning you. I would never do this but these anonymous sometimes witll. But yes Ask. is working on trying to get rid of those kinds of people. Be careful and try to ignore the questions especially if they come an anonymous and start asking you a ton of questions at once that just don't even make any sense.\n  \n  I would probably not answer too personal of questions like... where do you live exactly and any type of financial questions if they get too specific about them I probably wouldn't answer them. Don't give like... all sorts of specific questions on what you look and stuff. People could be trying to steal your identity or take your money or worse. Find you. And that isn't always a good thing... Their intentions is what I mean. They have catfish on here so be careful with that also. Me just looking out for you... A lot of new girls on here don't pay attention and aren't careful. There have been so many girls that have gotten catfished on here it's crazy and other apps.\n  \n  But over all this app is all around wonderful and you can meet lots of good friends.\n  \n  I have just learned to ignore the haters and trolls.\n  \n   Just remember none of these people know you fully so there's no reason to get upset about anything they say because they don't actually know you.
