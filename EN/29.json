if you may wonder . the reason why you want to have so many much as b c you would be surprised how much energy is taken from your batteries camera lights other electric tools that you use on your investigations . spirits feed off of energy and electric tools that are full of energy . that s why sometimes when you re on investigations and start to feel funny that means they re feeding off of your energy . and then you start to notice shortly after a lot of activity . spirits made energy to be able to create that activity . usually negative spirits feed the most off of people and equipment because they re the ones that want to cause more activity and more noticing . usually that s the case . or a lonely or sad spirit . usually a negative spirits in general . so that s why you want to bring more lights because if you re out at night investigating and your camera lights go off you need to have your phone light and your phone all the way charged but sometimes your phone will die . you ll notice that your phone is at a full charge and then miraculously after a minute investigation your phone is weirdly at or even dead and no service for some reason . and then say for instant you bring a couple of flashlights in your backpack you go to turn one on it doesn t turn on for some odd reason the brand new batteries that you put in it s are dead . you check the next flashlight it works for minutes and then dies . then you have no lights right ? so if you have the extra camera lights then you re good . should always bring backup plans when investigating at night . then batteries for your camera ? why so many ? the same thing happens to your camera batteries . they will die so you need more batteries just in case if the one your camera died and another one just in case it up and dies and honestly another one at that one dies . i have seen up to four batteries died in the same minute for some investigators . backup plans","26902":"i mean either one of those or any night infrared camera is good for at night ghost hunting . you don t always have to go at night either . activity happens throughout the day regardless but it s always good to get an infrared night vision camera just in case that night if you want something to help you out to see more . and of course they have night vision where you can turn off all the lights and all you can see in the camera is either a little white light or a little green light that s only seen by your viewers and the only thing you can see is through the camera to walk . and then of course the camera in general helps to see at night a lot better . you can even get a regular camera and just make sure that has night vision on it and you can buy one of those . you don t have to specifically buy one of those you listing . but of course if you i want one of those then sure . but canon cameras are really good . i recommend going to best buy so you can fiddle with the camera a lot before buying it . i find their service very good . of course if you have one in the area . regardless of covid i would not buy a camera online . you are going to want to touch it and mess with it before buying it . you re also going to want a few lights for the camera . i would suggest getting three to four lights because your lights will get drain really easily . always have fresh lights on you . especially when you re out ghost hunting at night . do not ever go ghost hunting by yourself . bring at least two or three people and do not split up . this is my rule with ghost hunting . you can split up into groups or more , but do not ever go by yourself because you never know what could happen to you . crazy people in the world and you could accidentally trip and hurt yourself or worse . when buying a camera you also want to get at least to batteries because battery life won t last long on cameras and if you re going to want to record all day long or long videos you re going to need lots of batteries .","26903":"alicia","26904":"?

which i hadn t been ? i was terrified and confused and feeling weak because they kept poking me and taking so much blood from me . . . ? and made me feel really bad . both physically and mentally . i m not exactly afraid of needles but i just don t like the sight of people not knowing what they re doing in the medical room when they re supposed to be . . . you know . . . have went to school for it and have their license or whatever you know what i mean ? horrible experience . i hope i never have to go through it again honestly . i actually love giving blood because it made me feel good . it made me feel like i was saving lives and which i was but i don t do it anymore because of the certain situations . sad to say . . . but hopefully i can overcome some day .","27563":"but yeah i don t mind helping older people at all it s just i can t bear to do that . i can do a lot of different things there s just a few things that i can t do . another thing i can t do is work with too much blood . i pass out and get really sick and faint . idk . it s strange . flashbacks and just really bad thoughts come to my mind with blood i don t know why .","27564":"go back to louisiana in a house of my dreams and start a family business and make a family of course","27565":"thanks and same back to you ! i hope you re doing okay keep your head up alright ?
