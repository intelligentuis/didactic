But I know she's trying to figure out who she's meant to be and what she loves. And we have invited her over or asked her to tag along but she just has other things to do ...

But it is Dani's life and she can handle herself, like I said previously the door never closed on her and still remains open. She's just trying to figure out who she is and seems lost.
