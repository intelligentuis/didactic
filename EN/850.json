do believe so because most children are not taught the basic fundamentals of life and lack basically needs because they were never taught how to cook or manage money . and some families struggle in life so they don t have the knowledge or money to make a meal to eat . and sadly alot of i ll say because you can getaway from family and live on your own but you have specific guidelines that come into play . lack the knowledge to cook , clean properly because they live and are cared for by adults until the parents decide to dump them on their own","787023":"basically if you had to move across

account . i don t know how it actually got suspended . . . all i know is i went to log on the following day after posting videos from tour and it said account unavailable . the account was made by fans and i later gained access to it . i know there was also a few fake profile of my friends , family , people were worked with , were associated with , used to date , currently in a relationship and even fakes of me going around and spreading false allegations and many pages were created as well . so i will clear this up . . only one sister is married , that is christina the oldest . she is married to nicholas reali one sister is currently engaged and planning on getting married soon . that is katherine . she is engaged to max lisa is in a relationship with chad gilbert from new found
