Now every single human in america has health care but people like our dads and families are paying for it cause Hillary and Obama keep borrowing our money so they can get the poor people's vote to get elected. The more money we borrow the further we go into debt. If she won we would be in a Great Depression era within 2 years.\n  \n  \u2022Why should we pay (and go into debt) for people who aren't even AMERICANS. Legal citizens. Immigrants are fine but so many people come here illegally and live here for free off of our borrowed money lol. Our children won't be able to have quality American health care because or the money that their parents worked so hard to give to them because they'd be paying for it with borrowed money that we don't have.\n  \n  \u2022She paid for her daughters wedding with the Clinton Donation fund. 4 million dollars of the American people's money that was supposed to go to good causes went to Chelsea clintons 5 million dollar wedding lol\n  \n  \u2022She personally ruined Haiti. She didn't rebuild any of it. She built hotels on the other side of the island. Resorts lmfao she didn't fix any homes\n  \n  \u2022And she let 4 Americans die on her watch because she used a private email server and knew about the attack on Benghazi but was too busy e mailing her husband about the attack to warn our soldiers.\n  \n  \u2022And she takes personal donations from countries on terrorist watch lists and takes them OFF the American Terrorist watch list if they pay her 2 million dollars lol she's literally selling out America I can't stand the woman. She's a criminal and deserves to go to jail.\n  ","656871":"\n  HOW IS YOU ??\n  ","656872":"\n  But a cute little spawn of satan tho ?\u2764\n  ","656873":"\n  From personal experience its better to talk about then keep it inside, even if no one is listening.\n  \n  But ill always listen\n  ","656874":"\n  Also i would never attack you (:\n  \n  Youre amazing too darling\n  \n  Oh oh\n  \n  Hows your lil youngin??\n  ","656875":"\n  Some females in here make me go,\n  \n  \"OH SHUT THE FUCK UP. you dont even know whats going on, youre too busy doing your hair\"\n  ","656876":"\n  Awh well then just keep your thoughts to yourself or do what i do and say fuck it, we're all entitled to our own opnions and ill argue\/debate my points till i cant breath\n  ","656877":"\n  OMG HI\n  ","656878":"\n  Thats awesome, i hope you the very berry best \u2764??  if i prayed, id pray for you.\n  ","656879":"\n  Awwwwh just ignore than babes, no reason for you to pay attention to nonsense.\n  \n  Im pretty good im having a relaxing day\u2764?\n  ","656880":"\n  Im thinking more hurt- hurted- hurting\n  ","656881":"\n  I dont like it when youre upset\n  ","656882":"\n  LOVE YOUR PRETTY FACE SO MUCH\n  ","656883":"\n  Wait im lost, what are we talking about?\n  ","656884":"\n  I should really make more tea and read my book\n  ","656885":"\n  Oh shitt!!

Hes just to die for. But looks arent everything, he has one of the biggest hearts ive ever seen. I have never had someone care and love for me the way he does. You can feel his love just through his words, and thats unheard of these days - people can only really show love through actions. I can trust him with my heart and thats why i have given it to him to keep safe for me, and thats what he's been doing this whole time. I've never met anyone who knows me like he does, its like he can read my thoughts, hes never been wrong about me. He knows my favorite everything, if we went on a game show that was called \"do you know your significant other\" he'd get every question right. He pays attention to the little things, the things people dont think that matter but they actually do. He knows how to love me the way i should be loved, he takes my thoughts and opinions in consideration. He can make me feel him without him actually touching me, thats how strong his love is. Things havent been perfect either and still 5 years later, he wants me to be his future and he will be mine. He taught me what love is, and im one of the lucky ones who have found true love. Even if things dont work out perfectly, at least ill know what it has felt liked to be truly loved - everyone doesnt get that chance. I believe he is my soul mate, and because i can actually feel him in my soul.

Theres wildlife here such as wolves, bears, cougars, deer, elk, and moose ect.. and since alot of people have cows\/sheep\/horses\/goats ect they need guns for when these animals come and try to feed on their livestock or on their gardens\/vegatables.\n  \n  Also when pack of dogs come around, they are vicious you need to be able to protect yourself. Also when you live in an area where theres a lot of space away from people, there tends to be some wierdos around and you need to be able to protect yourself then as well.\n  \n  Now its not like they are going around carrying guns, its only really for that use. Also for animal population control certain people have licenses to do sport hunting. But you can only do certain things in certain times of the year, its not like theyre going around killing everything.\n  \n  Ive been to a gun store and it was like a candy store for adults lol but honestly i dont think it should be wrong for someone to own a gun if theyre not just getting it to hurt people like how youd find in a more populated city or such as a gang.

But they still stayed true to themselves and did what they loved.\n  \n  Tu pac is a good example as well, people didnt really respect him when he was alive, but as soon as he was classified dead, he blew up. His music was noticed more.\n  \n  The most successful people are the ones that keep to themselves and be true to who they are no matter if society accepts them or not.\n  \n  So no they are sad and pathetic if all they think life consists of is to be accepted and to have people pay attention to them.\n  ","657519":"\n  Thats only if im in the mood for Hawaiian\n  ","657520":"\n  Jacob ??\n  \n  Every time i need a smile on my face, hes the one that puts it there.
