think evil can be defined as having bad , immoral , and or dangerous intentions from a very young age . there are some people who have been classified as evil such as prolific serial k llers like ted

mental illnesses are more likely to be the victims of crimes instead of the perpetrators .","283325":"sociopath is an antiquated term used to negatively describe people with antisocial personality disorder . i know one or two people with aspd , and they re deserving of kindness and respect much like anyone else .","283326":"this still isn t a question .","283327":"can people send me real

me from talking to certain people or trying to control when and where i go out with my friends . it s actually extremely common , and a lot of people don t really see that as a red flag . controlling behavior is a form of emotional manipulation , though , and should be taken seriously .","283369":"i ll be voting for bernie sanders . i completed the census the other day as well .","283370":"no , i

relationship with them because i don t live with my parents , and i only really visit them when necessary .","283401":"aw , thank you ! ! i m undecided , tbh . i ve had both incredibly short and long hair , and right now i m growing it out until i get tired of it , lol . i always say that i have the best of both worlds because one side of my head is shaved the other is long .","283402":"thanks ,

between this job and another job i thought i would enjoy my job was twice the distance away , but i had a better impression at the interview than i did for the other interview . i almost said no to the job offer because of the distance , but i m glad that i stuck with my gut and accepted the offer .","283404":"aurora borealis .","283405":"i don t really think it s much of a dance song , but

.","283409":"a quaint home with a lot of trees perhaps the woods in the backyard . it s rustic looking , with hardwood floors and a brick fireplace and soft rugs . there are plants in a few of the rooms , particularly the dining room and living room , and there are big bay windows in the front of the house and in the master bedroom . there s a den that has an entire outside wall of glass to look outside , as well as an outside porch in the backyard that wraps around the house . i d like a big bathroom with a clawed bathtub and a glass stand up shower with a seat inside up against the wall . it would be cool if there was a gaming room , just a room dedicated to my consoles with two different sets of screens for me and my partner , as well as a section for the computer and recording equipment .","283410":"i ask for advice from a close friend and try to remain focused on my short term goals .","283411":"some people consider beer to be trashy and gross , but it s my favorite alcoholic beverage .","283412":"my gameboy and gameboy advance .","283413":"i think that s ridiculous . people need their jobs to support themselves , and it sounds as if he s likely supporting her and contributing to the household as well . to give someone , who s a key worker and must work , that ultimatum is entirely selfish . in a relationship , you re supposed to be working as a team . it s hard when your partner is working extra hours , but you need to find a way to make it work .","283414":"i m indifferent . names don t mean anything to me .","283415":"not really , no .","283416":"she s not a veteran , but what she has and has not gone through isn t anyone on askfm s business . to assume that her struggles are lesser because she hasn t been to war is ignorant .","283417":"her perseverance is what makes her strong . i m not quite sure why you put hardships in quotation marks , considering you have no idea who she is and what she s endured , lol .","283418":"singing professionally , which means getting singing lessons and practicing on a regular basis . i love to sing , but i m absolutely terrible at it . i would have pursued music as a career if i had a great

support zoos at all , but i think that what they re doing is a great educational opportunity for both children and adults . it s sorta like getting the zoo experience without paying extraordinary prices to enter the zoo and see the animals in person , haha . i haven t watched any of the live streams , but i ve always been curious about big cats , such as panthers or snow leopards or lions or tigers .","283421":"my best friend a true warrior in every sense of the word . i admire her tenacity and ability to keep moving forward in her life and career despite the setbacks in her life , and she s endured so much hardship . she s one of the strongest people i know and i m proud to call her my best friend .","283422":"my anxiety has been at an all time high , likely due to the fact that the coronavirus is so unpredictable and that i lack a sense of control over what s going on in my life . things are different day by day , and we re forced to take each day at a time because the next day is uncertain . i ve been taking my regular xanax twice per day , but it hasn t been helping at all . i started taking some herbal anti anxiety medications from the pharmacy , and they ve been helping a little in conjunction with my xanax , but every day i ve woken up with a beating in my chest and inability to breathe .","283423":"i wish zoos would release their captive animals and release them to either compassionate sanctuaries with a lot of space for those animals to roam , or back into the wild . most zoos are in terrible condition and the animals are miserable .","283424":"it s simple , but i ve always loved hand written letters . i like personalized things where people are expressing their emotions or gratitude .","283425":"my camera roll mainly consists of cats at the

of mental health awareness , i seldom talk about the darker aspects of my illnesses unless i feel comfortable enough around someone to trust that they won t think i m crazy or something .","283431":"i pride myself on my writing ability , particularly in terms of creative writing in the form of personal essays and poetry .","283432":"no , that doesn t fall under the definition of ab se .","283433":"i m not a woman , so i wouldn t be considered a girlfriend . i m non binary , so i prefer the term partner . regardless , i don t exactly believe i m dating material at this point in my life . like i mentioned in a previous answer , i don t believe there are any perks to dating me .","283434":"when i was in college , i enjoyed reading dante s inferno by dante alighieri . i also liked the canterbury tales by geoffrey chaucer .","283435":"when i moved into a house with my two roommates , i inherited their two cats . lol .","283436":"i don t generally ascribe to labels . however , if i had to label myself with anything in order for people to better know me , i would say that i m mentally ill , non binary , a writer , a gamer , a tattoo enthusiast , and a coffee addict

talking to my friends about how i m feeling so that i can navigate those feelings in a healthy manner .","283439":"no , i don t believe in love at first sight . i think that s actually lust because you re attracted to someone at first glance , whether it s their physical appearance or their general vibe that they give off . you don t know anything about this person , so you cannot realistically love them in the genuine sense of the word love .","283440":"i think it s absolutely ridiculous , tbh . apparently they or someone else ? named another baby covid .","283441":"pre quarantine

ages . there s only a small fraction of people who are solely motivated by greed when it comes to them choosing their partners .","283444":"mental health advocacy and awareness . it has been something i ve been deeply passionate about for quite a few years now , and i try my best to educate others who have questions regarding mental health or mental illness , drawing upon my own experiences

first job was when i was years old , and i was hired as a cashier at a local drug store . eventually , i was promoted a few times to photo technician , photo lab supervisor , and pharmacy technician . i enjoyed developing photos a lot , and i liked the responsibilities of being supervisor of the photo lab . however , upper management was terrible and dealing with customers on a daily basis really frightened me .","283449":"i purchased my first car when i was years old , and it was a volkswagen cabrio . i absolutely loved that car .","283450":"yes , i went to two different colleges for my undergraduate studies . my first year was at a liberal arts college in massachusetts , and i majored in creative writing . after i returned to new york , i enrolled in a local college that i commuted to on a daily basis , and my major was communications and professional writing with a minor in english literature . i graduated with my bachelor s degree in .","283451":"i ve never owned an exotic pet , no . i ve only ever been around cats , dogs , and fish . my ex also has a bearded dragon , whom i miss terribly . as for which exotic animal i would choose as a pet while i do believe these animals should stay within the wild , it would be cool to have a sloth as a pet . lmaoo .","283452":"i don t exactly think there are any perks to dating me , lmaoo . i m not exactly an extraordinary individual , and i prefer solitude as opposed to being out with other people . i have no intentions of dating anytime soon .","283453":"it would depend on their personalities and how intelligent they actually are formal schooling isn t necessarily an indication of how smart someone is , because they could just as easily have done independent studies and gone through life experiences that have taught them knowledge . money isn t a factor to me when it comes to choosing someone to date , especially if the options are rich or average . i would choose the person with whom i connect with emotionally .","283454":"at this point , i m just hoping this quarantine ends within the next few months so that i can enjoy going out to a restaurant or local bar restaurant and enjoy some food happy hour drinks .","283455":"you re definitely not the only one , and i m sure plenty of people feel the same way as you do . depending on how severe your area has been impacted , you don t necessarily have to stay inside of your house . you can go take a walk around the block or take a solitary drive just to get some fresh air .","283456":"i ve never dated online before , so i m not quite sure how i would even go about doing it . however , i do believe it s important to remain vigilant about who you re talking to and make sure that you re always in a safe environment .","283457":"i m pretty good friends with some of my ex s ex girlfriends , if that s considered weird at all .","283458":"i come face to face with my own personal demons on a daily basis .","283459":"uh , obviously not . lmaoo . at this point , i can simply go to the store and pick up a pack of toilet paper . there s no need to do ridiculous things for something you can easily buy in the store .","283460":"i don t follow people upon request , so no .","283461":"hot coffee , two sugars soy milk . or an iced vanilla latte .","283462":"idk , i like any documentary that touches upon crime murders and the psychological reasoning why people commit crimes .","283463":"no . i mainly watch documentaries , true crime shows , dramas , etc etc .","283464":"no . i don t watch anything on cable television , lol . i only watch things on netflix , hulu , and amazon prime .","283465":"do you mean american idol ? then no .","283466":"not really , no . if you want a decent taste of the music i m into , listen to grey daze chester bennington s old band from the s . i m currently listening to them .","283467":"you don t necessarily have to be elderly in order to pass away from the virus . there are been dozens of people in their s and s , etc etc . , who have contracted the virus and passed away from it as well . there have been infants and babies who have died from the coronavirus . no one is immune .","283468":"she s exactly right . like i stated earlier , you can be a carrier and display no symptoms , but you re just as much of a risk as anyone else to pass the virus onto someone else . that s why i haven t visited my parents house lately except today to bring the garbage cans in . my mother is immunocompromised , and for some reason she doesn t seem to understand that i can still carry the virus even if i don t show symptoms , and i don t want to subject her to it at all . i live with two people who are essential workers who go to work with the public every day . it s highly probable that they re bringing the virus home with them .","283469":"yeah , i don t know anyone personally but i ve seen posts on social media of people continuing to go to their friends houses and hanging out , having quarantine parties , etc etc . it s completely irresponsible .","283470":"a hoodie and jeans ? lmaoo . i don t dress up unless it s for something significant , like a wedding or a funeral .","283471":"yes , most definitely . isolation in times of a global pandemic such as this is integral because it reduces the spread of the virus . when people would normally be going out to bars , restaurants , stores , etc etc . , they re now regulated and cannot go out as they please to interact with hundreds of people on a regular basis .","283472":"honestly , i agree . it s difficult to develop a vaccine and then patent it , test it through clinical trials , etc etc . right now , the best way to reduce the number of deaths is through isolating people to their homes and treating the current positive patients as best as they possibly can .","283473":"i honestly have no idea , tbh . it seems like the government is keeping us in the loop on a day basis . we won t know how long we re supposed to stay inside until the end of another day cycle .","283474":"uh . . . i m not exactly sure what you re asking ? obviously people want to be able to leave their homes freely , but that isn t advisable at the moment because many people can be asymptomatic carriers and spread the virus to at risk individuals .","283475":"i certainly hope not , but it wouldn t surprise me if it does . numbers aren t decreasing in the united states , at the very least .","283476":"lol , no . that s more of a summer time beer .","283477":"i m watching the movie outbreak . it s starring dustin hoffman and morgan freeman , and it s essentially about an epidemic that breaks out in california and the ways the cdc and hospitals react to the outbreak .","283478":"i m currently drinking sierra nevada s hazy little thing ipa .","283479":"i m just having a few beers , watching netflix , and browsing the internet atm .","283480":"uh , maybe a ? it started off terribly , but it s currently ending on a good note .","283481":"i enjoy both , within reason . i love nature and being surrounded by the woods and trees and bodies of water however , i also like decompressing at home with some video games and sleeping .","283482":"yes , i absolutely love the taste of mint . mint chocolate chip ice cream is among my favorite flavors . i also enjoy peppermint tea .","283483":"i ve never been to indonesia , and i don t have an opinion on people who are from indonesia .","283484":"hello today started off terribly because i was experiencing some pretty bad anxiety attacks . however , it slowly got better and i ended up treating myself to some taco bell for dinner now i m drinking a few beers and watching netflix while browsing the internet on my laptop . i m happy that i m not feeling very anxious anymore .","283485":"does anyone have any questions ? my inbox is empty","283486":"i m proud of myself for surviving my life thus far , and still holding onto the motivation to continue improving myself despite the hardships i ve endured . i ve struggled with mental illness since i was a pre teen , and i only sought professional help when i was years old . my entire life has changed since then , for the better . i genuinely think that if i didn t make that move to help myself at , i would have passed away .","283487":"i see absolutely zero advantages or positive things about the global pandemic . there are some people who consider it a blessing to be with their families during this time , but to call it a blessing completely ignores the fact that there are a majority of people who are in inconvenient and often dangerous circumstances as a result of quarantine . people are stuck at home with ab sive spouses . children are stuck at home with ab sive parents . there s a significant population who are at risk and vulnerable to the coronavirus , which makes it difficult to see family if they need supplies . individuals are dying at an alarming rate , and there are still so many people who aren t practicing social distancing and that s making the situation even worse . to call the pandemic a blessing is ignorant .","283488":"i believe they re all important in different ways , so it depends entirely on the individual as to what is the most important . for me personally , the most important thing at the moment is helping myself . i m in a position where i need to heal from past traumas , past struggles , past failures , etc etc . in order for me to be the best version of yourself , i need to help myself to the fullest extent .","283489":"i believe using the word addictive takes it a step too far , because addiction implies that someone has a physical dependence on something in that a person ends up going through withdrawals when they re without that substance . loneliness is dangerous to begin with , point blank . loneliness is a negative feeling , and i believe the word that s better for this particular question is solitude . you can be in solitude and not be lonely , and there s nothing wrong with that . a lot of people enjoy being in solitude .","283490":"i don t believe it s better to hold grudges , no . holding a grudge only ends up hurting yourself in the end , because you re clenching onto negative feelings and auras regardless of how the other person feels . sometimes you don t forgive someone , but you also don t hold a grudge against that person . and that s perfectly okay .","283491":"three values that i believe to be of the utmost importance are compassion , loyalty , and honesty . compassion because it s integral to cultivate meaningful relationships with others , and to have a sense of empathy in order to help those around you as well as yourself . loyalty because it s important to be true to your word , as well as be true to yourself and others . if you cannot be loyal to your friends or partner , then you need to re evaluate your meaning of relationships and how it can impact everyone involved . honesty because honesty is perhaps one of the most important facets of maintaining meaningful relationships with others , platonic or otherwise . you need to be honest with yourself and with other people in order to progress forward .","283492":"the healthiest things that i enjoy doing are sleeping , venting to friends , and expressing myself via art writing or painting .","283493":"taco bell , by far . i actually felt like treating myself , so i ordered taco bell for dinner , lmaoo . i had a cheese quesadilla and a cheesy gordita crunch .","283494":"honestly , sometimes i ll just eat a plate of vegetables for a meal , lmaoo . i love spinach , broccoli , asparagus , bell peppers , etc etc . i ll eat ceasar salads on occasion , but i don t really consider those to be healthy since there s usually cheese and dressing on them .","283495":"linkin park , by far . they were the number one sole inspiration for me during my teenage years , and they gave me a reason for existing . i lived through their music more than anything else , and i felt connected emotionally to them for a variety of reasons . they ve saved my life on numerous occasions .","283496":"? ? ? ?","283497":"i m tired of witnessing historical moments , lmaoo . between this pandemic , the attacks , the economy crashing , swine flu , the war in iraq , all of the mass shootings . . . it s too much .","283498":"taxidermy ! !","283499":"i met the members of linkin park back in like . . . , i think .","283500":"no , i don t believe in horoscopes . they re written as a quick buck and can apply to mostly anyone because of how vague they are .","283501":"lol , yes extremely . it s amazing how so many people seem to lack common sense these days , smh .","283502":"my day has been fine , other than the horrible anxiety attacks i had earlier this morning . i went to get taco bell with my roommate , so now i m quite content . i m planning on relaxing , drinking copious amounts of beer , and watching television .","283503":"wild animals are supposed to be out in the wild not held in people s homes unless they re ill and cannot survive outside of captivity . even in that case , sanctuaries are the best option .","283504":"i finished watching it earlier this week it was absolutely wild . each episode was more ridiculous than the last , and overall i found it very fascinating . i also like how people who have watched it are now educated on the harmful effects of keeping animals in captivity like that . there are more tigers in captivity than there are in the wild , and that s sad .","283505":"cheetos , omg .","283506":"no , we ve only lived at this house since october when bugs aren t really out , so we haven t come across anything .","283507":"because he was asking a question about the program i administrate , but the question he asked insinuated that i didn t do my job properly and he was just checking to make sure it was correct .","283508":"i got angry at my coworker yesterday because they were basically questioning my competence at my job in a very off hand , passive aggressive way . i m over it now , but it really angered me yesterday to the point where it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest .","283509":"i don t remember the majority of my childhood , but i believe it was reading and writing .","283510":"the best vacations i ve been on have been any of the times i ve traveled to upstate new york with my friends . they re only weekend trips , but i have such fond memories .","283511":"i m friends with two out of three of my exes , so yes i believe it s possible .","283512":"my ex , haha . we re still close friends and i ve always been able to talk to him about anything .","283513":"i m not really religious or spiritual , but i do believe that humans are composed of energy in the form of our souls these energies cannot be destroyed . when our physical bodies perish , i believe that those energies get transferred to another medium .","283514":"i prefer bruno mars over drake .","283515":"i actually don t think this has ever happened to me , lol .","283516":"gattaca and district were both good movies .","283517":"where did i go wrong ?","283518":"i don t own a nintendo switch , and i don t want to spend money to buy one solely to play one game , lol . i already have an xbox one that i use a lot .","283519":"no , i don t play animal crossing .","283520":"yeah , we re advised to stay in quarantine for the foreseeable future . only going out to places when necessary and every essential store closes at pm . new york is one of the places that has been hit the hardest , so cuomo has been giving daily briefings .","283521":"i don t personally know any gossip about myself . and i don t remember if there was ever gossip about me when i was in middle or high school .","283522":"no , i don t usually eat candy at all .","283523":"i suppose that has something to do with it , yeah . i went to yesterday which was good for me to leave the house and get some fresh air .","283524":"lol . some people think it s a gendered phrase while others don t . and who knows , the person insisting that there s only men and women could very well be a man . i don t exactly think a meme should be criticized so in depth , though lol . it s just a meme .","283525":"i m not doing so well today . i started crying at my desk earlier because my anxiety is so horrible this morning , even though i took my medication and a few herbal pills that are supposed to help with anxiety . everything is becoming too much it s overwhelming .","283526":"i wouldn t know , i ve been coloring my hair since i was a teenager .","283527":"haha , definitely not . i m terrified to even give myself a haircut .","283528":"no , nobody has asked me for money .","283529":"listen to music and or play video games . i especially prefer playing video games alone because it s my escape from reality .","283530":"my mental health illnesses . a lot of people don t think i m neuroatypical because i don t give off the impression that i m mentally ill , since i m good at expressing myself via writing . these people seem to think that mental stability and the ability to write well are correlated , which is far from the truth , lol .","283531":"eh , it depends on what the person did to screw up the first chance they were given .","283532":"i kept a journal when i was a pre teen . however , my parents entered my room and read the entire journal when i was at school one day , so i never wrote in one after that because i couldn t trust my family anymore .","283533":"tbh , i m terrible at calming myself down and looking at things from a different perspective , especially these days . however , some good tips i ve tried and they worked sometimes are document your feelings in a journal . take a relaxing , solitary walk outside if it s safe to do so . do a hobby you enjoy , personally i like video games , writing , and art . vent to a friend about your worries concerns . watch relaxing videos or listen to tranquil music on youtube .","283534":"i had a productive day ! ! tonight is dedicated to relaxation . i worked my normal hours , ordered some chicken fingers for lunch , and then after work i went to with my roommate for some beer . we came home and then i made dinner , so now i m just sitting down and watching ghost adventures .","283535":"i don t have a boyfriend at the moment .","283536":"friendship is something that happens naturally , it isn t forced . regardless , the rest of my social media accounts are

understand your answers because i only speak english .","283541":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","283542":"having a job amid this global pandemic . i know so many people who have been laid off due to the financial impact of the coronavirus , who have to collect unemployment and will be behind on their bills because unemployment won t be enough . i m grateful that my company has had the opportunity to transition to remote work so we can still get our regular paychecks .","283543":"this is the most recent thing i ve drawn .","283544":"i got a matching tattoo with my best friend ,

gender or race or religion . it doesn t play a factor in who i like or dislike .","283552":"i ve had sex before . i don t discuss my sex life on the internet , though .","283553":"i don t listen to

about what i want for dinner .","283560":"no . why would i hate lnr ?","283561":"i ve mostly been playing fallout new vegas .","283562":"i love playing pool , but i m pretty terrible at it .","283563":"literally two minutes ago , lol . my roommate and i were talking .","283564":"i like granny smith apples the most .","283565":"everyone is beautiful to at least someone , and ugly is simply subjective . beauty is most definitely in the eye of the beholder assuming we re talking about physical beauty .","283566":"i don t think i do , lol . everyone i ve liked in the past has looked totally different .","283567":"i don t have it saved , but apparently a new proclamation was declared today or yesterday that people who suffer from cardiac arrest who are over the age of who can t be revived in minutes are to be left at the scene and not transported to the hospital . which is . . . shocking , unbelievable , and downright scary . i understand the reason behind it since hospitals are full with covid patients . but it s still so wild .","283568":"brains intelligence is more important than whether or not you re physically attractive , particularly in relationships . looks can only go a certain distance until it becomes void , and the way you emotionally connect with someone determines the ultimate relationship you have with them .","283569":"i don t believe i ve ever tried curry before .","283570":"apparently in a global crisis , i can still remain focused on my goals and maintain my own anxieties despite the chaos going on around us .","283571":"we re afraid to make mistakes because of the negative ramifications that come as a result of those mistakes , whether they re mistakes at work , at school , or in our interpersonal relationships . it could lead to a lack of trust or disappointment , among other feelings .","283572":"i haven t seen a toy story movie in at least years .","283573":"it doesn t necessarily scare me , no . it s quite unbelievable and shocking for sure , but it isn t terrifying to me or anything because i ve been practicing social distancing .","283574":"usually by venting to friends and listening to music .","283575":"no , i haven t . there s no evidence that g is harmful .","283576":"i d probably travel somewhere that i ve always wanted to visit , like some national parks on the west coast of the united states .","283577":"my birthday is in november , so i sincerely hope this quarantine ends prior to that .","283578":"lol . seriously , there s literally no interconnection at all .","283579":"i briefly read an article about the theory and found it hilarious that people actually believe this . lmaoo .","283580":"i believe crying is just a natural human response to stimuli that moves us emotionally , whether in a good or bad context . it s healthy to cry because it releases endorphins , thus making us feel better .","283581":"i don t know much about most musical artists , so i wouldn t be able to make a determination of whether or not someone is a sell out . i can only assume that term is reserved for individuals who forego artistic freedom and expression in favor of money .","283582":". . . do you mean like , internet service like on our cell phones ? if so , then definitely not . lmaoo .","283583":"all denim outfits , lisa frank accessories , and bell bottom jeans .","283584":"lmao , no . i had enough

bunch of people with ridiculous nonsense drank a lot of tequila .","283587":"myself , lmaoo . i am totally angry at myself for what i did last night because i was absolutely out of my mind , and now i

my coworkers .","283590":"hello i m all right , but feeling absolutely like garbage . i couldn t sleep at all last night because i was hypomanic , and now i have a splitting headache and i m nauseous

i can t walk around the house much because my roommates are sleeping , haha . thanks for the suggestions , though ! !","283594":"yeah , i know i won t , and tbh i d probably get lost because i m on the intersection of two major roads . i d probably end up somewhere on the highest which isn t exactly where i want to be .","283595":"it isn t really advisable to walk the streets of my town at am , lmaoo .","283596":"yes , i enjoy poetry i ve also written poetry in the past .","283597":"i m descending into mania i can t sleep . everything is amusing and it s taking everything in me not to leave the house and walk the streets out of sheer boredom , lmaoo . someone keep me distracted . come on . let s go","283598":"i prefer bacon over sausage . but i wouldn t have a sandwich with just that ingredient , lol .","283599":"ask me questions","283600":"no , i don t own a mask or gloves . that s partially the reason why i have gone out except to the pharmacy in the past days .","283601":"uh . . . this isn t a question . this is a statement .","283602":"no , i ve never really been one to find many people very attractive , particularly men . obviously i think my ex is attractive , but otherwise it hasn t been a thought that has crossed my mind in a long time .","283603":"hahah . i totally thought you were being petty , not gonna lie . but this just makes it even more hilarious .","283604":"lol . i thought that was hilarious .","283605":"yes , dieselmom is gorgeous .","283606":"no , but tbh i don t find many people attractive these days . when i do , they re mostly women

t tolerate any form of harassment , trolling , or s xual inquiries .","283610":"you re better off asking a person who s a parent . i really have no idea about this sort of thing .","283611":"i understand the vigilante approach , but to be fair , the fact that you m rdered someone who previously m rdered someone you loved doesn t really make you much better than the original person . so while you were emotionally driven to seek vengeance , the outcome of that scenario remains the same as the original person who hurt your brother . as for morality revenge is far different from someone who s killing out of a sheer desire to simply kill . in terms of good and bad , i wouldn t consider you a bad person for doing what you did .","283612":"i think new friendships that are rooted in destructive habits and or toxicity , like both people are feeding off of each other s problematic behavior , can soon become invasive and too forward . in those cases , you re simply bonding out of a shared desire for self destruction , especially if you re both encouraging the other person to engage in bad behavior .","283613":"for the most part , i believe that the coronavirus well , covid specifically is simply a mutated , stronger version of the coronavirus that no one was able to predict because we had not yet come across that strain before . that s why it s been so destructive and lethal like nothing we ve ever seen before . without proper knowledge or vaccines , we re left to fend for ourselves . granted i do think the conspiracy theories are interesting , and i also believe there s more of an underlying political part of this outbreak than what s shown in the media . but i don t believe it s a man made biological weapon or anything .","283614":"well , when i talk about people who deserve to get hurt , i m mainly talking about criminals who have done significant emotional and or physical trauma to someone else like m rderers , r pists , p dophiles , etc etc .","283615":"i used to be close to one of my cousins from my mother s side of the family , but after i got over the whole partying stage of my life , we became distant .","283616":"right and wrong is subjective depending upon a person s own sense of morality . obviously there are also guidelines that dictate what s right versus wrong i . e . the law , but in most cases people will do what they want according to their own moral system . i believe that if an activity hurts a person who does not deserve to be hurt , then it s a bad activity including if it hurts yourself . right actions , on the other hand , are indifferent actions or actions that benefit people .","283617":"hello do you have a question ?","283618":"depends on the activity and your own sense of morality . if you re not hurting anyone through your actions , regardless of how wrong or right they are , then i don t really think there s anything inherently bad about that .","283619":"creative , destructive , unstable , openminded , and emotional .","283620":"ironically , the best phase of my life was probably the time when i was most self destructive i was likely hiding my feelings of s icide and depression well by taking part in partying and illegal activities , but i don t remember ever feeling so carefree and reckless and genuinely liberated .","283621":"the brain . i m mostly just jealous of people who produce adequate levels of serotonin .","283622":". . . why do you think this is an appropriate question to ask someone . lmfao .","283623":"i ve been miserable since the breakup , tbh . i m just more content now because i ve been working from home for two weeks haven t had to leave the house except for dire necessities .","283624":"depends on whether or not i m in the wrong , lmaoo . if i did something wrong then i have no problem with apologizing . it s better to own up to your mistakes instead of deflecting blame or ignoring the mistake entirely .","283625":"i don t have a preference . i normally just do what it is i need and want to do without concerning myself with what other people are doing .","283626":"my best skill is my talent in writing . i utilize it everyday at work , for which i m quite thankful . tbh , i have no interest in teaching others because i honestly wouldn t know where to begin , lol . i ve been writing creatively from a young age so it always came naturally to me .","283627":"ah , i m so sorry . the same thing is happening to one of my roommates . his hours got reduced because of less available work , and he s been coming home around pm instead of pm like usual . i know a lot of people out of work . prior to establishing us working from home , my job furloughed people from my department alone . i also have friends whose jobs have closed and they re on unemployment .","283628":"that s what happens when people get older . their thoughts opinions evolve .","283629":"my favorite book is girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . i read it when i was a teenager and fell in love with it because it described exactly what i experience in terms of mental illness . it taught me that i wasn t alone in how i was feeling , and it also encouraged me to express my feelings and symptoms via the written word .","283630":"depends on the pros and cons of moving outside of the relationship . i would have to have a guaranteed job that i ll enjoy or i d even work my current job remotely if possible . i d have to consider the financial ramifications involved as well . loving someone simply isn t enough , in most cases . you need to preserve yourself and do what s best for yourself as well .","283631":"no , it isn t important to me . i have a strained relationship with my parents so their opinion doesn t hold any water when it comes to my personal life .","283632":"being productive throughout the day , whether it s through my daily work at my job or doing chores around the house .","283633":"when i have to be , yes . i don t go out of my way to be confrontational , though , nor is it something innate within me .","283634":"it s the same amount of work as when i m in the office .","283635":"happiness is a feeling that is influenced by external factors in one s life , as well as one s own attitude . it s also the result of stable hormones and neurotransmitters , on a biological level at the very least .","283636":"happiness is an elevated state of contentness with oneself , one s life , one s social circle , and or one s accomplishments .","283637":"i m still working my normal hours from home . aside from that , i ve been watching television and playing video games .","283638":"you ll have to be more specific . what am i moving on from ?","283639":"no , i dislike pranks .","283640":"i usually think the batteries died or malfunctioned , so i hit the remote until it starts working again . lmaoo .","283641":"i like crab , but i don t ever really order it .","283642":"definitely not , lmaoo . i don t trust myself , or anyone else for that matter , to shave my undercut . i ll wait until my hair stylist is taking appointments again .","283643":"no , i ve felt this way about myself since teenagehood .","283644":"i ve been self isolating at home for the past two weeks besides going out to the grocery store the pharmacy . i took a walk to the gas station last night though , lol .","283645":"aw , candace ! ! you re so sweet thank you so much .","283646":"i prefer vegetables over fruits . i love spinach , broccoli , carrots , and asparagus .","283647":"i d like to change everything about myself , lol . i don t like my body or my face really , and i dislike my arms because they re littered with scars to the point where people constantly stare at me . i d also like to rid myself of my mental illnesses , but that isn t exactly plausible .","283648":"linkin park , grandson , two feet , stone temple pilots , soundgarden , starset , watsky , nf , korn , in this moment , otep , and k . flay .","283649":"looks can be decently important , but it s ultimately intelligence that determines whether or not a relationship can continue . looks are superficial , meanwhile intelligence and having conversations with a person truly is what connects you intimately with someone else .","283650":"if you re going through hell , keep going . basically stating that if you re struggling through hardship , you must keep your eyes on your goals and persevere despite those struggles . if you find yourself in hell , keep pushing forward to the other side .","283651":"justice and revenge are similar in that they re both dedicated toward putting those who commit wrongdoings in a state of punishment . however , justice deals more with the law and law enforcement and abide by governmental regulations . revenge , on the other hand , deals primarily with individuals who wish to take means of punishment into their own hands like a vigilante , for instance . revenge is more personal than anything else .","283652":"here are some people who occasionally ask questions . psyquietrist dieselmom heyguyswantstuffjustask urlsareshittbh","283653":"i ve been all right i haven t found a new therapist , but that s also because i haven t necessarily been looking , lol . i haven t been to therapy in months and i believe i m doing fine in light of current circumstances .","283654":"i don t believe i ve ever stated that i supported completely open borders . however , i do disagree with the wall trump has said he s wanted to build , because i think it s ridiculous and harmful . additionally , people who come here illegally do not benefit from citizen taxpayer money . however , i am a supporter of universal health care and believe that everyone should have access to health care regardless of their status .","283655":"my summer plans aren t much different from my plans throughout the rest of the year . my routine doesn t change during the summer .","283656":"in a way , yes but i never expected to be working for a company like the one i m currently working for , nor did i ever think that i would have dedicated two years of my life to a law firm . i m writing on a daily basis , which is great and aligns with what i want to do . however , i still have goals of being an established author .","283657":"no , i haven t had a reason to use zoom .","283658":"not necessarily , no . at this point in my life , i m pretty indifferent .","283659":"ugh , that s terrible . i honestly hate all sorts of april fools jokes because they re usually cruel and not warranted . i d probably feel the same exact way as you .","283660":"no , i m not close to my parents at all . we ve always had a strained relationship .","283661":"generalized anxiety disorder . lmao . regular things make me anxious , but i start feeling panic whenever i have to drive somewhere , when i have to talk to someone on the phone , and lately it s been whenever i need to leave the house .","283662":"i suppose so ? haha .","283663":"i haven t gotten my hair done since november , lol .","283664":"i don t have the motivation or energy at the moment .","283665":"johnny depp is my preference , but leonardo dicaprio is also a terrific actor .","283666":"do you mean distinct difference ? lol . yes there s a significant difference between a fear and a phobia . a fear is a normal reaction to something of which you re afraid . it doesn t necessarily affect your daily life . phobias , on the other hand , are severe fears that do affect your daily life , and can further lead to extreme mental health conditions such as anxiety and panic disorder . agoraphobia is a classic example of this .","283667":"lol , no . i m honestly just trying to live my life on a day to day basis as opposed to worrying too much about the future especially now considering how uncertain the future is . i m spending my time working full time , and also playing video games , watching television , and talking to my roommates .","283668":"probably

done . the day actually goes by a bit faster because i ve been able to focus more with less distraction , haha .","283735":"yeah , it s absolutely ridiculous . health care facilities , like hospitals and clinics and now even the javits center , are pleading with the government for more ventilators , and trump has the audacity to say nah , i don t think you need them or no , your nurses are hoarding all of the masks . it s absolutely infuriating . nurses and doctors are wearing the same masks for several hour shifts in a row , multiple days in a row . i read somewhere that even patients

an alarming rate . it s science , more than anything else .","283767":"i ve never really thought of any challenges , so no . honestly , i think everyone is extremely stressed out at this time instead of making challenges for ourselves , we should be more focused on doing things that keep us on a routine , that keep us stable , that keep us occupied , and that keep us relaxed .","283768":"i don t really believe that you can make a determination of how much or little someone loves you solely by sex . the real way to determine someone else s feelings towards you is how they act outside of the

lol .","283773":"according to pottermore , i m in slytherin house . although slytherin has a bad reputation , there are loads of good people who get assigned to slytherin and i would use magic for the betterment of my loved ones society , as well as for fun .","283774":"i started reading you by caroline kepnes last month , but never finished it .","283775":"this sounds like a question a year old would ask .","283776":"he s ignoring the advice and pleas from medical professionals is more worried about the economy as opposed to the thousands of people who have passed away across the globe . it s disgusting . he said that governors weren t appreciative enough of him , or something along those lines , and didn t think more ventilators were necessary in certain hospitals . even though they re desperately needed . he s been raving about viewership on his most recent press conference , but doesn t realize that the reason it was watched is because citizens are terrified , confused , and left in the dark about what s happening .","283777":"i ve always washed my hands routinely , but i did start washing them more often and using hand sanitizer , especially when i worked in the office building .","283778":"no , i didn t wear a mask . i don t own one .","283779":"i m not sure , tbh . i don t know the science or economic aspects of it .","283780":"yeah , it s absolutely terrible to hear alongside the patients who have been suffering from the coronavirus as well . in most countries especially the united states , hospitals and other facilities simply do not have the adequate equipment necessary to treat everyone , as well as protect themselves . doctors and nurses are forced to wear the same mask for days at a time because there has been such a shortage .","283781":"deconstruct tasks into multiple smaller steps . it s much easier to tackle a difficult task when you ve broken it up into progressive parts that you can check off as you go along . remember to take time to go at your own pace and remember to breathe . not everything is a rush , and you need to take your own tolerance into consideration . remember that things will get better , even if they don t seem that way at the moment . the truth is that most things are only temporary and will come to pass .","283782":"yeah , i was the only person on line at the pharmacy besides the one who was at the counter in front of me . the pharmacy counter put up a glass barricade with a slot on the bottom , kinda like the ones you see at the bank . the pharmacy technician was also wearing a mask and gloves .","283783":"my inbox is actually empty ! ! i cleared out like extra questions from three months ago that i know i d never answer . ask me some new , interesting questions","283784":"having a deep commitment and feeling of care towards someone unconditionally to where you want them to do their best in life help them out in any way you can .","283785":"i m doing fine much better now that i have all of my medication i ran out of two of them last week . i m just watching tiger king i m contemplating going to bed soon . i don t have any plans this week besides work , haha .","283786":"yeah , i had a bunch at my parents house that i didn t end up taking to my new house . i only have maybe or mugs here .","283787":"i don t really see a reason for me to collect anything , and plus i don t like holding onto things that i don t need .","283788":"no , i don t .","283789":"my ribcage tattoo hurt the most .","283790":"yeah , that happened a lot during the transition of being a teenager into being an adult . it happens it s relatively normal and common .","283791":"drug addiction is a health care issue , not a criminal issue . part of the reason why there s so much recidivism is because the addict still obtains the drugs in prison , which only aggravates the addiction more . instead of giving them a tougher prison sentence , addicts should have the opportunity to be enrolled in comprehensive rehabilitation programs that they can actually afford .","283792":"seeing my friends my coworkers .","283793":". . . that s not in the nude . that s wearing a robe , lol .","283794":"i don t walk around the house in the nude , lmaoo .","283795":"this is a stupid fetish .","283796":"that s an answer that only he would know , tbh . we ve never discussed that before .","283797":"yes , she got married in .","283798":"? ? ? i have no interest in dating , let alone my roommates with whom i ve been great friends for years . i also have no desire to make my ex jealous because i m an adult and that s childish behavior .","283799":"they re average human beings . like i said , i ve never thought of them in a romantic or sexual context .","283800":"i m not eating any more or less than what i usually eat .","283801":"i actually left the house for the first time in like . . . days . lmaoo . i went to the pharmacy drug store and there were actually a decent number of people there , surprisingly .","283802":"i m sorta like an extroverted introvert in that while i need alone time to recharge and feel refreshed , i m also outgoing around very small groups of friends .","283803":"being alone is one of the only ways i can actually recharge , because being around people drains me so much . i usually just browse social media and listen to music . sleeping also helps a lot .","283804":"i made eggs this morning for lunch i wasn t terribly hungry , so i just toasted an english muffin and put butter on it . my roommate feels like making cheeseburgers , so we ll probably have that for dinner .","283805":"definitely not , haha . i ve been friends with them for years and i ve never been interested in either of them like that .","283806":"i m going to put it towards bills groceries .","283807":"i m comfortable at the moment . i have the window slightly open , but i m wearing sweatpants and a hoodie .","283808":"i ve never used a dating app before .","283809":"obviously black people can use the word as they please since it s their word to reclaim . the n word has been used to oppress black people for decades .","283810":"i agree with this as well . our attitudes mean everything when it comes to dealing with difficult tasks or situations , and if we enter into a situation with a positive or productive attitude , then the outcome may be more in our favor .","283811":"i agree , most definitely . it s important to remain committed to your goals , because you re going to hit road bumps along the way regardless and you shouldn t allow them to deter you from what you want to do .","283812":"i swear all the time , even when i m not frustrated .","283813":"i wanted to discuss with people and show people that mental health is important , in light of my own experiences with mental illness and witnessing my friends struggle with mental illness as well . i don t really remember if i had a particular perspective prior to my early s . i didn t understand mental illness because it was never discussed with me despite struggling with it since my early teenage years .","283814":"i honestly don t remember . probably last summer .","283815":"i m frustrated but relieved at the same time , haha . i just spent nearly two hours trying to contact my psychiatrist the office is closed to patients , so the office has been scheduling video chat and telephone appointments . the video chat wasn t working on my doctor s end so i ended up just sitting at my laptop and waiting for over an hour until she finally just called my cell phone , and we talked that way . now i just have to wait until my medication is ready for pickup , and i ll have to leave the house to go to the pharmacy either tonight or tomorrow .","283816":"ever since my early s , i believe . i didn t properly seek mental health treatment for myself until i was years old , though .","283817":"i live in new york , which is now considered the epicenter of the coronavirus at the moment because of the high volume of cases and deaths . there are over , cases on long island alone , not counting the boroughs or upstate new york . things are going as well as they can be , i suppose . people have been instructed to stay inside unless it s for essential travel .","283818":"yeah , the coronavirus is definitely making people emotional for a variety of reasons . your emotions are completely valid .","283819":"i don t really have high standards when it comes to movies , haha . however , when napoleon dynamite first came out while i was in high school i think , everyone was obsessed with it . i watched it and thought it was terrible , though .","283820":"that is part of the issue , yes . a lot of people diminish the significance of mental health and mental illness because it s an invisible illness , and there are also some people who believe that mental illness is something one can control or get over , which can t be further from the truth .","283821":"it varies depending on the relationship some people want to move in together after a few months , other people wait a few years . it s whatever feels most natural to the specific relationship .","283822":"not really , but if provided the opportunity , i don t believe i would say no .","283823":"not really , no . i always go to stop shop because it s the closest supermarket to me .","283824":"yes , i actually took the andme ancestry test a few years ago ! ! the results were definitely interesting .","283825":"no , my roommates and i rarely have the opportunity to do so .","283826":"depends on the situation because it s both yes and no .","283827":"i cannot stand arrogance and or close mindedness the most . it s frustrating when people cannot think outside of their own bubble and automatically assume everything contrary to their own opinion is wrong .","283828":"either minutes to midnight or hybrid theory from linkin park .","283829":"i m doing fine . i m currently waiting for my tele appointment with my psychiatrist , haha . they closed the office to patients so every appointment is done over the phone or via webcam facetime .","283830":"yeah , there s an italian food market that i go to sometimes .","283831":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","283832":"i m working from home .","283833":"i m watching the show tiger king on netflix this sh t is wild .","283834":"that s definitely not true at all there are myriad individuals who have died from the coronavirus who aren t elderly . no one is immune . recently , an infant in new york passed away from the coronavirus .","283835":"look at everything trump has been saying about the coronavirus he s been downplaying the virus completely making statements that go against everything medical professionals are saying . a lot of people are wondering if it s because he doesn t want this pandemic to affect his possible re election .","283836":"no , lol . i don t believe there s any political cause behind the coronavirus . however , the reaction to the virus from various governments is politically driven , and that s what is concerning .","283837":"like a cure or vaccine ? i believe so , yes .","283838":"i ll think about that if it ever becomes an issue . for now , it s merely fiction to me .","283839":"it s terrible , obviously . i m hoping that everyone is staying inside their homes and doing their part to halt the progression of the virus .","283840":"i don t believe in any religious spiritial god or higher being .","283841":"why are we yelling .","283842":"because my ex and i broke up a few months ago .","283843":"i m currently single .","283844":"no , i m not really a big fan of their music .","283845":"uh , i finished it ? lol . i ve simply never believed in god , and to me the bible is simply a fictional story book .","283846":"new york .","283847":"i read the bible when i was much , much younger .","283848":"there s no scientific proof of the existence of any god , and i m of the understanding that most people only believe in god because they have faith . i don t have that faith , and i never did .","283849":"obviously because i don t believe in god .","283850":"yes , i m an athiest .","283851":"oh my god . why would you say those words . now that annoying christmas alvin the chipmunks song is stuck in head .","283852":"sometimes i wish i had disney or something so i could watch then older disney movies , haha .","283853":"it makes me irrationally angry . lmao .","283854":"i don t think i ve ever personally come across any weird scams . i ve only ever dealt with the ones where the elderly and others get a phone call where they re told their family member is in trouble they have to wire transfer a ridiculous amount of money to the scammer .","283855":"probably a coffee shop it s ideal because obviously there s coffee , and its a good environment to sit down and get to know someone .","283856":"that stupid dance monkey song that s all over the radio .","283857":"i have no clue , haha . i have a smart tv , so i m guessing that maybe it is k ? i use it to watch netflix and hulu .","283858":"no , exercising isn t a requirement or anything to be a regular human being , lol . i m sure some people choose not to exercise because of laziness but that isn t always the case .","283859":"tbh , i agree with you cheating is a conscious decision , and if he genuinely does love and care for you , then he would have stopped himself and thought about how this would affect you .","283860":"not necessarily . feelings change over time , and just because someone has cheated doesn t necessarily mean they never loved you . however , the fact that they did cheat obviously does indicate that they don t care about seeing you get hurt .","283861":"i never said it was every day , lol . that s your preference , though . not everyone feels the same way you do .","283862":"how is it inappropriate ? we re still friends .","283863":"neither , i ve been trying more than anything else to focus on the present moment .","283864":"i try not to have any regrets because it s useless to worry about something that s not in your control anymore .","283865":"atlantis the lost empire or treasure planet .","283866":"abandonment by my loved ones .","283867":"we talk on a regular basis .","283868":"i prefer beer over vodka .","283869":"i d rather live without my television . at least with my phone , i can still talk to my friends , browse the internet , etc etc .","283870":"yes , my friends consider me very loyal and trustworthy because i always keep their secrets to myself .","283871":"you re anonymous , you re a stranger , and i m not interested in dating .","283872":"i m enjoying the quiet . i m not bored at all , because i ve been working from home monday through friday and then i ve been watching television and playing video games in my spare time .","283873":"i don t have children , no . i m not sure if i even want children in the future .","283874":"mcdonalds , i can t stand kfc . even so , i usually only order mcdonalds french fries their coffee is good too .","283875":"yeah , i m single .","283876":"i don t really like sports , but i went to an ice hockey game once .","283877":"i m always down for questions likes .","283878":"i ve never tried it before .","283879":"i worked in retail at a drug store for years of my life , which was absolute hell .","283880":"lmaooo . when you sent the first question , i was like . . . what . ? yes , my roommates and i have been cooking home more often than not .","283881":"there have been people advocating for hotels in new york city to allow homeless individuals to use their rooms during the pandemic , not sure if anything has come to it though .","283882":"never heard of it or had it before .","283883":"i ve already been through significant hardship trauma , so what s one more year to add onto the baggage ?","283884":"i don t know what that is .","283885":"it s definitely not just the flu , especially considering how fast it s been spreading over the past month alone and how lethal it has been to people of all ages . then coronavirus is a serious matter it infuriates me when people aren t taking precautions seriously . they re drawing their own conclusions based on what they personally see , instead of listening to health care professionals . if you don t know anyone who has tested positive , it s most likely because the test is difficult to come by and they simply haven t had the privilege to be tested yet .","283886":"definitely not , lol . i don t have the tolerance for incredibly spicy food .","283887":"no , but his response to the coronavirus has been absolutely disgusting and inappropriate .","283888":"no , not at the moment especially considering the virus is supposed to peak in the next two weeks in new york . it s safer for everyone to simply stay home .","283889":"ugh , you re absolutely right . she s manipulated and gaslighted me for my entire life , and guaranteed if i brought up the word ab se she would turn it around against me and claim that i m trying to ruin her reputation , or something wild like that .","283890":"i m sorry in that case , lol . i know first hand how difficult it is dealing with a parent like this . my old therapist questioned if i ever wanted to confront my mother about everything in my past , and tbh idk i even want to at this point . i m finally living on my own i just want to heal and move on .","283891":"tbh , i don t mind it at all . i m fortunate in that i m still working monday through friday but at home , so it s something to take my mind off of things and keep me occupied during most of the day .","283892":"she definitely doesn t , which is so bizarre to me because it was both physical verbal . she always berates me these days and tells me i don t know how you turned out this way ! regarding my mental health issues . she doesn t realize that my upbringing between both her and my father is the cause of all of my problems .","283893":"i haven t been outside the house besides to sit on my stoop in days , lmaoo . i m not really sure how things are outside , but according to my roommates , the roads are much emptier than usual . i m not really sure of the police presence , but i do hear sirens often throughout the day .","283894":"i m unsure of the term love because you cannot unconditionally love someone then ab se them for over years of their life . she s always seemed to have an ulterior motive , though , and she always tried to make me feel guilty about saying no or prioritizing myself .","283895":"i m not planning on leaving my house unless it s to go grocery shopping or pick up my medication at the pharmacy .","283896":"yeah , he works in new york city so . . . i guess he s as safe as he can reasonably be . from my understanding , he still has to work through all of this .","283897":"we talk on the phone every few days as it is . i really do think she just wanted me to bring breakfast over , show my face , and do her laundry though despite the chaos going on in the world . i m not going to risk my own health her health just because she s denying that the coronavirus is a huge deal .","283898":"i haven t visited in about a month ever since the whole quarantine thing started .","283899":"she could have done that herself , yeah . the issue was that she wanted to see me , even though everyone is urging others to stay in their own houses and practice social distancing . she s also immunocompromised , but apparently isn t even concerned for her own health .","283900":"no , she s disabled but she wasn t born with a disability .","283901":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","283902":"i normally say what s up or how are you .","283903":"i m assuming it means what s good .","283904":"yeah , everyone can order food depending on the restaurant . they re only offering takeout and delivery at this time .","283905":"i have a headache i m hungry , but i have zero motivation to leave my bed .","283906":"i haven t left the house in days .","283907":"this one sorta weirds me out too , tbh . i m not sure how i feel about it because even though they re pretending to be non consenting , they actually are performing consensual activity . at the same time , though , it s probably common among people who have experienced assault and are the kink as a coping mechanism .","283908":"studio ghibli gardens illustrations overall are beautiful .","283909":"i wholeheartedly agree . i m usually incredibly accepting and understanding of most kinks as long as they re between two consenting adults , but ddlg is definitely not one of them .","283910":"yeah , it seems like more of a very unhealthy coping mechanism in light of their age regression trauma than anything else . it has no place in the bedroom .","283911":"ddlg is honestly the one kink that i cannot support . it isn t healthy for someone to pretend to be a child in a s xual relationship , and then for their partner to pretend to be grooming a child like that . it s always seemed incredibly wrong to me .","283912":"it s been fine . i just woke up from what i think was a three hour nap .","283913":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","283914":"it wouldn t surprise me if i was , considering both of my roommates work with the public on a daily basis .","283915":"no , they cannot afford that .","283916":"i m not sure if this is sarcasm or not . there are over , cases on long island alone , and that isn t counting the five boroughs or upstate new york .","283917":"she s pretty much bed bound so unfortunately i will have to go over there do some chores for her eventually since my father is out of state for the next two weeks extremely long story , he s safe and it s for a valid reason . but i honestly don t think she understands the gravity of the situation . nobody is really supposed to leave their homes to see other people except those they already live with . i m not sure if she even watches the news or not .","283918":"i don t usually talk about my family , but i m legit so livid rn because of my mother s carelessness about the coronavirus . she texted me earlier this morning asked me to pick up egg sandwiches for breakfast and go over her house to do a load of her laundry . i responded told her that we cannot leave the house unless it s absolutely necessary , and after about minutes , she sent me a huge paragraph about you haven t left your house i haven t left mine so it s fine . . . thanks anyway to shorten it a lot . like . . . it s like she doesn t understand we re all in quarantine . not only can i be an asymptomatic carrier because both of my roommates interact with the public on a daily basis , but she s also immuno compromised and in her s . realistically she should be concerned for her health , but instead she gets angry with me for following what the cdc and governor says to do . it s unbelievable .","283919":"i love going down to the bay and having a drink and listening to live music . i also like eating at restaurants at their outdoor tables , and having nighttime campfires with my friends .","283920":"oh jeez , lol .","283921":"you can probably discuss your feelings with her and explain that you feel uneasy because they ll be drunk , and see where it goes from there .","283922":"if you have a legitimate reason to not attend , then they shouldn t hold that against you . however , if you re saying that you just simply don t want to go , then yeah that s a bad impression .","283923":"i m actually an extroverted introvert , meaning that while i am introverted by nature being around large groups of people tires me out and i need solitude to recharge , i m also extroverted around close friends and very small gatherings .","283924":"this is currently my workplace , haha .","283925":"i m fine with both ! ! i like answering questions about my own experiences with the coronavirus pandemic , as well as other questions that relate to something else entirely .","283926":"i don t mind the conversation about the coronavirus at all , tbh . i find it to be interesting , and i m happy that people are discussing it and emphasizing staying inside quarantining , because that s the safest thing to do rn .","283927":"just cheese . sometimes i ll order pepperoni though .","283928":"yes , restaurants are considered essential businesses , but we cannot dine in anymore the only option they provide is delivery . i ve been cooking at home for the past week or so , but last night we ordered a pizza .","283929":"depends on how he words it and how he behaves , tbh . he isn t the type of person to beg or anything so this is fairly unrealistic to begin with anyway .","283930":"if i wouldn t share them with anyone , then why would i share them on askfm where everyone can read them ?","283931":"yeah , i do . i also miss my friends and coworkers .","283932":"i haven t bought an actual , material item that wasn t food in probably over a month , lmaoo .","283933":"i automatically think of pewdiepie , ugh .","283934":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","283935":"for the most part , yeah . it takes a lot for me to feel comfortable enough around someone to actually trust them .","283936":"we all cook when necessary .","283937":"i don t give that out because i m only friends with people i actually know .","283938":"i like it a lot , mostly because a few of my coworkers have become great friends of mine though .","283939":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","283940":"no , i spend most of my time working since i m working from home at the moment .","283941":"new vegas is my second favorite fallout game , with fallout being my favorite . fallout is the third of them , but i also never played and .","283942":"i ve been playing fallout new vegas lately , but i also enjoy skyrim , fallout , destiny , the assassin s creed series , bioshock , gta v , and other fun games i play sometimes with my friends .","283943":"my bedroom . where i can be alone and play video games and browse the internet on my laptop without interruption .","283944":"hello do you have a question ?","283945":"chester bennington , chris cornell , and scott weiland .","283946":"this is weird .","283947":"thanks for the confirmation . lmao .","283948":"i m not sure if i m just drunk or this message makes absolutely no sense .","283949":"i just said it was pink , yeah lol . he made it with tropical punch a lottttttt of tito s vodka .","283950":"hello do you have a question ?","283951":"so my roommate just came in and handed me a glass of pink liquid , and said it was unicorn juice . there s clearly alcohol in here , so uh . . . i guess i m getting f cked up tonight ? ?","283952":"i don t play games like this .","283953":"no , we haven t done anything romantic or sexual since the breakup . we re strictly friends .","283954":"honestly , i never thought i would live to see this age to begin with , so i never really set many expectations for myself when i was younger . i only knew that i wanted to spend my life writing and expressing myself through writing and art , which i suppose i ve successfully done so far .","283955":"artistic , eccentric , and socially awkward . lmao .","283956":"i talked on the phone to a client the other day , and i didn t have a panic attack ! ! it was a minute long conversation , and initially he was a bit agitated but i managed to talk him down . he seemed satisfied by the end of the conversation .","283957":"i generally receive hate messages in reference to my gender and my opinions . depending on how unruly the anon is , i either delete their message especially if it isn t even a question or elaborate educate as best as i can .","283958":"there are better alternatives in clothing than wearing the fur or skin of a dead animal . you can easily get faux fur or faux leather .","283959":"well considering we re not together , no lol . if we date again in the future and things are better though , i would consider it .","283960":"we talk most days out of the week .","283961":"nope , i ve been wearing glasses since i was a toddler .","283962":"i m not relieved at all . i m very much heartbroken still , but i m also grateful that we re still close friends because we have terrific chemistry together and our friendship itself is very strong .","283963":"yes , love is most definitely real .","283964":"i find that a bit weird at first glance , but they re both legal and consenting adults , so it isn t exactly my position to judge .","283965":"my own experiences with mental health , love , relationships , etc etc .","283966":"chronic illness , particularly invisible illnesses like mental illness and other physical illnesses that aren t apparent at first glance .","283967":"uh , yeah ? rofl . it s such a nice feeling to get out of pajamas , take a steaming hot shower , and then change into other pajamas
