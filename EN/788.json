halloween night .","729227":"yeah so far i really haven t had any issues with people . not counting the person that wanted me to follow them on only fans lol . but drama in general , haven t really seen any of it , yet lol","729228":"thank you . yes there is a reason for that actually . many years ago i was getting a lot of spam from bot accounts for some reason . i reported the issue and they fixed it . so i m not sure if i deleted them myself or if support did . it s been a while since i ve been on here i m surprised i even know how to use the site still lol .","729229":"oh i am not picky

. i even have wild berries that i hybrid with other berries .","729231":"let s just say i had a couple of close calls in regards to health . the people were so nice that treated me . so one day i wanted to help out others the same way they helped out me . the most common reasons is due to not getting enough nutrients in their system or certain vitamins . diets , eating healthier and ect . but lately i ve just been dealing with covid patients since i m cross trained as a critical care nurse .","729232":"i assembled my gaming chair for my computer . took me an hour lol then when i found out that certain attachments were placed on the wrong side i had to detach it and then reattach it back at the right areas so that took another minutes lol","729233":"i was planting green onions and cilantro . thank you , the short haired chihuahua is the oldest she is years old her name is chiquita . then the long haired chihuahua , he is years old name is chaco . roxy is the coarse haired crossed terrier . she is like years old but still acts like a puppy lol .","729234":"i got the party pack because i had a friend over . xd","729235":"i am a nurse practitioner . specialty is dietetics

sunday off , then i work two doubles monday and tuesday of next week and then i am off beginning wednesday until tuesday of next week because of thanksgiving holiday .","729236":"well pretty much the pandemic made me came back lol . besides video games , during my free time i wanted to do something else to pass the time , so i figure asking and answering questions would be one way in coping my sanity . unless my friends are under different accounts , which i get the feeling some are , then i have no clue who anybody is at this point . but you know what they say small world so i m sure i ll run into somebody i know .","729237":"i go out and get it maybe once a week . ordering home food is probably anywhere between to times a week . but i love to cook so those times could vary

.","729240":"cyberpunk , it s an upcoming video game that s going to be released on december th","729241":"you are very welcome .","729242":"awesome thanks , i followed you as well .","729243":"absolutely . money doesn t buy happiness .","729244":"oh that s pretty simple . if you are hallucinating then you re doing it out of confidence . other people may view you being hallucinated out of this reality yet you re engaged in a new reality which they cannot understand except you and chose to accept this new reality . it s that inner experience , within a world , a society how insanity was created in them . fear is an illusion , and that is what causes hallucinations . but beyond that fear somewhere down the road is the truth . being crazy has its emotions , actions , feelings . people who does unthinkable hatred , crimes and mischief . which leads to a next question , what is a choice from there ? living in fear and staying crazy ? or accepting those fears to find the truth and finding the wisdom in the heart ? for any experience to occur in life there must be a choice first understand it or not , even if you find a reason for why things happen the way they happen . it will not change anything in reality because things are the way they are , what matters is your choice .","729245":"i try to keep good habits most of the time . only bad habit i have is eating way more then the amount of sugar needed .","729246":"i know for a fact i couldn t . i tried being vegan for like weeks lol it was very stressful . but every pile of meat that i eat there is always that pile of vegetables sitting right next to it keeping it company .","729247":"i think most people these days just lives their life one day at a time and don t worry about the future . i m sort of in limbo when it comes to that . a day is just a day , but i want to make that day as great as possible looking forward ahead to the other days and hoping the same results .","729248":"you know this is a questions and answers website . not facebook , not twitter , not instagram and most definitely not only fans .","729249":"i probably would go move to like an island somewhere , maybe become a graphic designer . somewhere where it s peaceful and you only see a few people around villages and stuff .","729250":"that is a really tough one . i will plead the fifth on that one lol","729251":"yes i have . about or so times . it s a different environment that s for sure , it s nothing like home .","729252":"haven t been into a fight . maybe when i was little but i

ago .","729258":"what kind of cat was he ? how old ?","729259":"i would take my family and close friends to the nearest town to paint it red ! ! !","729260":"a pandemic .","729261":"hot tea , candy , video games .","729262":"maple glazed sheet pan salmon . i think that s how you call it . it was very delicious i know that much .","729263":"i cannot picture myself vomiting uncontrollably all day , that would be a bad feeling on its own .","729264":"phone , laptop and a few friends .","729265":"i m not so sure . i know when i was growing up i had to work hard for the things that i wanted . i m not saying everybody is like this today , but some wants to be self entitled like they re owed something .","729266":"my laptop and my phone .","729267":"i would totally like to go dancing with shakira . that singer needs to teach me a couple of moves .","729268":"i do indoor volleyball mainly .","729269":"i doubt i would be able to eat it for a second . i prefer wendy s instead

holiday is both christmas and halloween .","729271":"if i had an extra i would put it directly into my savings account .","729272":"your grades will dictate your success . teachers told me that all

made .","729273":"mexican food hands down . i can eat that stuff from dusk till dawn if i wanted lol .","729274":"i can t really answer that , each person has a different mindset , their own

person away from my house . nobody steals from me .","729282":"based on the amount of zombie games that i ve played i think i would do pretty good lol .","729283":"sense of humor most likely . my day is not complete until i make somebody laugh .","729284":"bow and arrow . i have family that are native americans who came from the cherokee tribe , i totally want to learn more about their culture . i also want to learn japanese culture .","729285":"last time i went bowling was about years ago . it was my first time , i didn t do too bad .","729286":"sometimes when people disconnect from game it

where we were be getting our butts kicked and somehow in the middle of the match we ended up reversing it and winning the whole thing .","729288":"most of the time i do . anything to make people laugh .","729289":"i probably would put myself at an .","729290":"it would depend entirely on how often we communicate . the more we communicate is the shorter amount of time it would take to make a

checklist is actually reasonable after the first week though","729358":"non toxic big time , but past that being respectful , understanding , kind , but honest are great qualities .","729359":"it depends . if talking about a happy ending for happily ever after for everyone it s pretty much impossible in real life because no one will be forever happy for their entire life , add everyone to that even more unlikely to occur . but if a happy ending like the ending was happy then absolutely . for instance when a wedding happens and they drive off feeling happy , the event wedding ends with them happy , therefore happy ending or in a movie the heroes win , it s usually considered a happy ending","729360":"usually either minutes early or min late .","729361":"mac and cheese with hot sauce or

different reasons . some were raised never to show weakness and view apologizing as one . some feel they need to prove themselves and if they apologize it means admitting they were wrong at some point

anyone . some are embarrassed when they re wrong , some just really believe they were in the right even if they actually aren t . everyone has trouble apologizing at least in one point in their life ,

for you and if it turns out not reasonable remember the earlier you change it the better ! don t wait until you have subs then decide to tone back on video rate . but if something happens later on the effects the ability to keep up the earlier the better still stands ! when you get the mean comments , just delete them ! if they keep appearing from the same person don t be afraid to block them ! there s nothing wrong in protecting yourself ! also there s been an increase in s x channel bots in small channels . just report delete . figure out what you want to do for the channel or if you know , just go ! first few videos you may feel a bit awkward or scared . but the awesome thing of starting from scratch is you get practice time before you get traction you ll be a lot more comfortable by then ! . a mistake imo that i see when a channel changes to something else say going from reactor to gamer is announcing it . slowly merge don t announce ! subs won t hop off and you ll have an easier time with the yt algorithm with gaining subs interested in the new content as the previous ones leave . the higher the sub amount the quicker the rate of new subs get . once you hit you re usually set ! just be sure to do your best to keep up the same schedule you ve been using . allow yourself mental breaks as needed ! ! one thing i recommend is to make an extra video every now and then not all at once to prevent burnout by that sh t is real and if you re gone for awhile you can just post those during your break . you can set a video to be published at a certain date even years ahead without a premiere . you can change it if you get back from break earlier than the date the videos release date to hold it for when if you need it in the future ! if you have anymore questions just send a message directly to me via any of the social medias connected with my carrd link on my profile here . best of luck !","729470":"absolutely yes ! allergic to cats , in love with dogs !","729471":"not

trouble finding friends even online that would be interested in dealing with your attitude , thus creating a snowball effect of negativity causing more issues , those issues causing more negativity , that negativity causing more issues and so on . if you have a reputation of being polite , friendly , and grateful , you ll be invited to things , have a wonderful life , get to meet many people , find new interests , and more . this kind of life can really only get better . pulling each other up in a positive relationship instead of bringing people and thus yourself down yields amazing results
