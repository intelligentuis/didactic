have been working so hard trying to get this year all finished out for you guys . planning our best videos , trying a lot of new things , finishing up our tour , coming out with our winter merch line , jewelry line , and book believe in you ! ! ! ! in the midst of all of thisss i ve been trying to cultivate balance in my life it s been difficult for sure bc i have a tendency to be a bit of a workaholic i m like oh yeah i can do everything ! i can stay up late ! i can wake up early ! i can ignore my friends ! and myself ! and literally everything else ! but . . . . that ain t it . i reposted a quote on my story today that sums it up real well . it talks about doing your best and how you do your best when you take care of yourself . you do your best when you are healthy and happy . doing your best is not running yourself into the ground til you can barely function . trying to accept that . the biggest thing i ve been trying to change is making the choice to do things for myself even if it means sacrificing something else . like going to bed when i know i need more sleep , being minutes late when i need to grab something i forgot instead of just going without it , canceling plans when i need a night to myself . bc when life gets so busy , you re going to have to sacrifice something and i am not sacrificing myself . neither should you . the world will keep turning and you will be fine if you don t do every last thing people expect of you and you take the time you need to take care of yourself instead .","781636":"not posting the monday mood board on

pictures , exchanging gifts , letters etc . which made me want to yeet them . then people just thinking they re entitled not fans to touch hug me or for me to hug them etc . helloooo i don t like being touched by strangers or people . i barely know . a fan also has a panic attack as the show was starting , luckily our openers stopped the show completely to make sure she was fine . and theres also so much that was just a disappointment overall . i don t think i will ever do business with them again until they fix these issues with employment , training , and management .","781645":"i think

safer to use . how can we get rid of plastic safely is the question ? the wildfires in california and australia how do we stop them ? why are they happening ? what s around the can even cause a spark ? how do we provide nutrient and a water source to the dry parts before hand ? questions i feel the world is failing to ask . . . that could be somewhat beneficial","781705":"for real . we thought she

improved so much and can sing some high rangers . lisa patted my shoulder at the time of that part to make sure i still wanted her to sing my part which i did . she did not purposely sing over my part

behind the scenes in my personal life that s really stressful and i don t exactly know what to do","782198":"lynne also put the girls in dance classes , and eventually they found their way to musical theatre , which became a huge part of their lives . in , the cimorelli family joined a local youth musical theatre company . they spent several years doing shows a year and all the cimorellis who participated , including some of the brothers , really enjoyed the shows . they learned a lot about performance and how to put together a great show . during their time in musical theatre , many of the siblings also took dance classes including tap , jazz and hip hop , and workshops and classes for acting and improv . their love for music continued to grow as they performed in musicals like annie , the wizard of oz , high school musical , high school musical , and seussical the musical . as they entered into their teen years , the older cimorelli family was as obsessed with music as ever , and there always seemed to be music in the house , whether someone was singing , playing the piano , drums or guitar , or writing a song . music became one of the central elements of the cimorelli household as the kids started growing up . to be continued . . . next week , you ll learn about the early days of the band , and where it all started !","782199":"the cimorelli parents , mike and lynne , were both huge music lovers , although in very different ways . lynne had her master s degree in music with a concentration in piano performance . she was a classically trained pianist and vocalist , and the music she liked to play around the house was a diverse mix of classical pieces by some of her faves mozart and tchaikovsky and greatest hits cds from the s she loved bands like toto and jefferson starship . mike was never taught music in a formal setting , but he loved to blast music in the car while driving his kids around , or out in the garage while working on a car or project . his music taste was much more classic rock focused , including bands like pink floyd , warren zevon , neil young and cc . although mike claimed he wasn t a good singer , his kids noticed whenever he loudly sang around the house , he had a very nice voice and he also had an ear for intonation . lynne wanted to experiment with how early kids could learn to sing in harmony , so she began teaching her kids how to sing harmonies when they were around ages . you could say this was where the band , cimorelli , was born , as harmony is the main hallmark of the group but more on that later ! lynne also wanted to pass on her love of piano to her kids , so she taught all of them to play the piano . the girls of the family especially loved playing the piano , and they would even argue over whose turn it was to play the family piano . along with teaching her kids to play the piano and sing in harmony , lynne also started a children s choir at their church so they could start learning pieces of music and singing them at church . she taught them complex harmony arrangements and they started building their knowledge of classical music as kids . from children s choir , their exposure to musical opportunities and experiences grew . their grandma , phyllis , recommended the older girls , christina , katherine and lisa , learn some part harmony arrangements of barbershop songs so they could perform them at nursing homes and small community events . they learned songs like don t sit under the apple tree , boogie woogie bugle boy , and take five and began performing them when they were around the ages of , and . lynne also put the girls in dance classes , and eventually they found their way","782200":"about to have a mental breakdown","782201":"it s a film day . . . say hi to one of

without having to worry about making sure i have body guards and paparazzi around me which we deal with when we are around like james for example . . but we have been having some issues where people are not respecting our personal , private lives and are invading . as in , coming to some of our houses and just like leaving weird gifts or whatever . which have been reported because it was getting out of hand but now some people are asking our friends for like our phine numbers . and are making fake instagram accounts etc . to make it seem like they attended a college chris went to . to get a follow to lurk into my personal life , and to prove a leaked photo of us was real . and still continue to invade my privacy . like if i wanted people to know , and was comfortable with the world knowing then i would share it when i felt the timing is right . but right now im not comfortable or sure if anything is the right time . and logging onto a social media were i follow alot of people included into the cimfam and the first thing i see is someone bashing me and chris because they dont agree with my choices or what im doing . or they dont like someone because their views differ from theres , or theyre not attractive to them , or because they believe they know the history and go based off one side they hate the person , but think theyre implied to hate on someone who they do not even know personally and say things that are really rude and toxic . its just to much at times , and i see why christina is kinda reluctant on posting things about what she s going through and why if she ever has kids there hardly will be any posts of them on her socks because she wants to respect and protect their privacy . . . . sorry for the rant just things i been dealing with for the pass two weeks since a stupid photo got leaked","782248":"yessir","782249":"i m glad","782250":"i love you","782251":"exactly like if i wanted you to know something then in time i ll tell . . . but getting into my personal life before i feel comfortable is just wrong on so many levels","782252":"idk why people think they re entitled to know everything about someone . then bash them because their views different from urs or you don t like them because the history they had with your stans","782253":"but just like wanted u to know whats been going on","782254":"being left alone in the middle of the
