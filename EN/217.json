This can cause internal bleeding of the lungs which can then come out of the nose. Since horses aren\u2019t physically  capable of breathing from their mouths, they can choke and suffocate on their own blood.

You must be thinking about lunging like the action of springing forward at somebody aggressively like a dog attacking something.

All I can say is that horseback riding requires skill, hard work, dedication, and time. At some points it can be very difficult and frustrating! But so can all other sports!\n  ","232996":"\n  A horse with chrome is a horse with white leg markings and face markings\n  ","232997":"\n  No! Unlike most other mammals horses lack the ability to throw up. This is because there is a valve in their stomach that is only one way and does not allow food to come back up there esophagus. Their esophagus is so long that it would take too long to come out and they would choke on their vomit before it came out of their mouth. Horses are also unable to breathe out of their mouths so if they were to vomit they would probably choke from not being able to breathe as well.\n  ","232998":"\n  Yes, horses are mammals. They give birth to live young, have hair, have warm blood and are able to thermal regulate, and produce milk for their offspring.\n  ","232999":"\n  That\u2019s a very interesting opinion. I\u2019m glad you feel so passionate about the equestrian world. Keep in mind that horses are no longer wild animals and humans have made them what they are today. If humans were to disappear from the earth then most horse breeds and individual horses would die without our care. \u201cWild\u201d horses of today are actually a misnomer. The term should be \u201cferal\u201d horses, as they are domesticated animals that are considered free range livestock.

It\u2019s hard to really gauge how \u201csmart\u201d an animal is since we can\u2019t know for sure what\u2019s going on in their heads but horses are known to be able to read human emotions, remember places, objects, smells, and words, and be able to bond with humans socially. We tend to think dogs are \u201csmarter\u201d because they\u2019re pack animals with similar social needs and are much better at distinguishing between positive and negative reinforcement and human emotions, however, this is probably a product of their breeding. Humans selectively bred dogs to be better companions, but we selectively bred horses for their athletic and physical prowess, not as companion animals. That\u2019s probably why most people would consider dogs to be smarter. However, horses consistently score better on the \u201csmartness scale\u201d than other domestic animals like cows and house cats!\n  ","233001":"\n  Yes, I have a boyfriend and his name is Sandy!\n  ","233002":"\n  No, unlike other domestic animals like dogs and cats, horses are obligate herbivores. Their stomachs are not designed to be able to digest any quantities of meat\n  ","233003":"\n  Yes actually that IS true!
