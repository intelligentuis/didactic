know anything about anodites","200915":"when did i say the stream aliens were canon ?","200916":"lololol","200917":"they would have to increase their mass , even if they were hollow","200918":"is there one you want ? i can t remember which i ve posted","200919":"other than going up ?","200920":"probably","200921":"yes , but it s a very deep sleep and dream","200922":"victory ?","200923":"maybe the duration would be shorter because of her constitution . but pesky s sleep dust is more like an anesthetic than a battle of wills . although the dreamer can exert their willpower in the dream to fight back if they realize they are dreaming . but this type of dream fight probably won t influence waking up any faster","200924":"leaf blowers","200925":"let s just assume gutrot can synthesize just about any chemical gas you ve seen in cartoons and comics , although some he may have to see to know how to make","200926":"yes","200927":"you ve already seen what happens when she s

you insane","200935":"i don t know any of them","200936":"throw him a lego rope !","200937":"she d be an awesome action figure . especially with the bike","200938":"decided to finish portaler first","200939":"can t think of anymore off hand","200940":"missing crucial info here","200941":"a cobra buzz boar that s a full circle like attea s cycle , and some kind of tie fighter rip off","200942":"which list ?","200943":"i don t know that i would have done it","200944":"i ve already given my contributions to the double digits family","200945":"i ve heard of it , but i haven t seen it","200946":"gave up","200947":"rook and khyber were probably the hardest to figure out","200948":"keep it","200949":"nope , i ve been doing that since before gurren lagann","200950":"i don t remember saying that but it sounds awesome . zed should sniff ship s butt","200951":"nobody s made an offer that s worth my while , if ya know what i mean","200952":"i can t remember . probably dou or

raise enough for two lines !","200959":"it changes all the time but right now quinn s ideas","200960":"this could be one !","200961":"wowwww","200962":"i definitely wouldn t take that as the general rule for zombies","200963":"it s just mumbo , no jumbo . the amazing mumbo . it s possible i guess","200964":"steven choi and chap yaep . they designed them for uaf also","200965":"only like so far","200966":"mindless things seem like they d be way easier to possess","200967":"i don t but maybe i could make one","200968":"it s not as fun as spitter , he s taking longer","200969":"yeah i ve

bought","200973":"not usually , i m only doing these current ones because guardabarranco collections has some very rare and unreleased omniverse toys","200974":"lolol","200975":"probably like you described it , yes . just not an infinite loop or anything","200976":"man i hate these kind of questions . are you really naive enough to believe you marry your first girlfriend without ever dating anyone else along the way ? what are you three years old ?","200977":"no , it was one they had made , those are from style guides for merchandise","200978":"lol i saw a really bad one the other day . someone had decided that some totally unrelated original series alien with a completely different design was actually also bug lite . it blew my mind . ben fans seem to be the worst at putting two matching images together . they are always taking things that look nothing alike and thinking they are the same . also they thought his name was a reference to the beer bud lite . what . the . hell . that is some grade a dumb assery right there .","200979":"you ll have to narrow that one down for me a little","200980":"yes ! someone gave me that same chart on twitter but thanks ! i would have made ditto too big otherwise . i remember seeing an aliens size comp in the uaf offices that even had way big . i wish i had grabbed one !","200981":"i m not sure","200982":"probably only a handful more

just can t see his face . i really don t know i ve never asked him","200994":"i just might","200995":"it was matt youngberg s and my idea , we had worked with him on transformers and wanted to again . youngberg felt like he worked especially well because judd s voice naturally sounds like something in between yuri and paul eiding","200996":"you re still reading ziggy ? i thought that ended in the s","200997":"nope not serious","200998":"probably !","200999":"it s my attempt at doing the dalmatians style xerox clean up line . i love that texture . i do my pencils on paper , then darken them on a photocopier . then i scan in those lines , adjust them , then use that as my cleanup . dyemooch has a photoshop brush that has a nice texture to it that he uses also","201000":"he was on the list but not chosen","201001":"i m going to do chamalien and one more obscure alien for the commission i m currently doing . i might do antigravitesla after for fun if i still feel like it .","201002":"right now","201003":"they are fairly comparable , but sg sari is a little older and a bit stronger","201004":"ones we ve seen","201005":"you can do a kickstarter and bribe me with tons of money","201006":"yes . franklin was one other","201007":"nope","201008":"well the undertown alien gil was designed by either steven choi or chap yaep , i cant remember . then those of us in the writer s room chose him as one of the mistake aliens ben would get , and we all ended up liking those guys so much we added them in as regulars","201009":"nope","201010":"ah , thank you !","201011":"captain marvel ! !","201012":"mystery , sci fi , horror , comedy , fantasy , and once in a while non fic","201013":"nah , there would be galvans instead of mice if it was me","201014":"chamalien

goop","201032":"probably not right away","201033":"i suppose it s possible , but he would need to encounter one first","201034":"after a certain point in the series they told us we had too many aliens , and had us stop adding more . i also just couldn t ever figure out what to do with fasttrack .","201035":"no , man of action wouldn t know . they didn t work on the shows much until the reboot . you d need to ask people who actually worked on the show like dave johnson , perkins , soto or pugsley and klein .","201036":"you re welcome","201037":"yeah , i wish we had that would have been cool

worked on the bios section , but that s about it other than the minor revisions to the complete version . it was my intention that cyclonus was from the future , but the scalpel part is stuff they

it would just take a long time getting through the layers of dead skin an calluses","201094":"mostly how the powers are used is left up to the board artist and their director . i tried looking of examples of powers model sheets and didn t find any","201095":"sure . it s interesting when doctor doom attempts to mix magic and science . and villain team ups are always cool","201096":"maybe ! it just depends on what they wanted to do with it","201097":"he s an excellent swimmer , he can reach fast swimming speeds then launch himself onto land like a torpedo and then slide on his belly . he

crew","201136":"i didn t know there was nth metal in the bat plane bat wing . im not sure how to classify nth metal , i don t know enough about it to understand it . it seems like nth metal would enhance the tech level in a machine but i have no idea in what ways","201137":"they are the predators of their crops","201138":"it s very interesting but it s too far outside my knowledge to classify .","201139":"we stream at twitch . tv dyemooch follow dyemooch on twitter for stream info","201140":"hasbro never considered omega a viable toy option . it s a bummer","201141":"the visor is used at

his aliens , ben is always going to be at a disadvantage because the powered person will have spent their whole life developing their powers where ben only has the powers for seconds at a time and does very little individual alien training","201159":"i do collect . my wish list is mostly for stuff that didn t get made , but i ll try to think of things i m looking for that are actually possible to get transformers i m really looking forward to the quintessons , but the vintage figure i d like most is the original g breakdown power rangers i have one but i d like a few more of the power morphicon purple moogers . and more moogers in general really ben af albedo and any omniverse toys that were not released in the us gi joe the original pimp daddy destro figure and the new classified

, and it was written like that","201213":"yes but that would be pretty dangerous for his more fragile human form","201214":"definitely","201215":"probably pretty well lol","201216":"if i could have figured out a place for it i probably would have used it , but we don t see much from pyros show up in galactic civilization . i did put the galvan walker toys in too though !","201217":"i think the

helen s genetic donor , but she s already been posted","201286":"not that i remember . i don t remember our plans changing other than his addiction . maybe khyber wouldn t have come back , i don t know","201287":"it would be like burning godzilla but radiating fear","201288":"i didn t have anything to do with their creation","201289":"i would offer them gum","201290":"i just don t think he would care","201291":"i don t remember him . he s from transformers ?","201292":"if you can tell me what episode he s in it would help me narrow my search . i mostly only have full seasons of and ,

still beloved by the people and the media","201307":"say it one more time and he ll appear","201308":"i don t know what that is","201309":"maybe just swap vehicles modes . it s probably described as mixed faction because bulkhead was supposed to unwillingly be the torso","201310":"both last stand of the wreckers and more than meets the eye take transformers characters and storylines to new levels that tfs had never really been treated like before . i can t recommend them highly enough","201311":"pigs are smarter than dogs ! no offense","201312":"i m sure this must be a coincidence and not at all what you re referring to","201313":"if you if you follow me because you like ben omniverse , you could start with transformers animated . that s the first series matt youngberg and i did together . if you want something dark and gritty you can can check out the graphic novel the last stand of the wreckers . and if you like that you should read the comic book series more than meets the eye . the other option is beast wars , which has some dated computer animation but it s a good entry level series with super cool story arcs and lovable characters","201314":"hm i don t remember","201315":"magical","201316":"i definitely said exactly the opposite","201317":"they probably text every once in a while","201318":"my sleep cycle has been pretty random since the quarantine","201319":"god i hope so .","201320":"exactly . maybe hokestarr should start catering","201321":"yes","201322":"wait a minute , the chrononavigator is just like a temporal jack sparrow

arm to use it ?","201330":"ha , maybe . he s got a great voice","201331":"we don t do anodites , sorry . maybe we could do an un lucky girl version of her sometime though","201332":"no . no upgrade can do that other than ship . if they had a mechamorph do that it was an error do to someone not having the basic understanding of how upgrade works . i accept it with ship because he s unique and cute but it s really goes directly against how their powers actually work","201333":"i guess he would probably think it s pretty quaint , or maybe think it s cute like it s a child time traveller s first toy","201334":"you don t have to ask to make a suggestion","201335":"what do they do","201336":"sylvester mccoy","201337":"why are every one of these frigging underwater space breathing

whatever","201371":"you guys assume so much and i just can t find the logic behind it at all . i keep trying to point people in the right direction and they keep stubbornly refusing to listen","201372":"show him the dam !","201373":"well that wouldn t be very exclusive , would it ?","201374":"gourmands aren t really known for their willpower or mental fortitude , so they probably couldn t do it . the ectonurite has to be intangible when it s expelled anyway so it wouldn t be contained in a slime ball","201375":"depends what time it is","201376":"well , cybertronians aren t

yes","201413":"when people are the most terrified , he shoots a prismatic laser beam from his single eye","201414":"argit or gluto","201415":"yes","201416":"probably more unique things like love

the show , but i d have to read them","201422":"nope","201423":"it s one of those things that seems like it s done differently with different writers . i wonder if the omnitrix scans any member of an alien species and it creates a baseline dna that is representative of the species instead of a direct copy of the individual","201424":"it doesn t sound like anything he does","201425":"sari s helmet is based on his so that might give you some insight","201426":"medic !","201427":"it was animated traditionally","201428":"they just evolved in colder climates","201429":"it s definitely one of the

episodes","201437":"he couldn t absorb it all , he d have to redirect it","201438":"how exactly is that pronounced ?","201439":"they never asked","201440":"did i post these already ?","201441":"he has survived being extinguished but i don t know if he has to breath or not","201442":"he would be aghast","201443":"yes","201444":"probably liam","201445":"it s bound to happen sooner or later","201446":"they had stored sparks before the allspark was sent away","201447":"somebody who can do a steve buscemi impression","201448":"i d rather do hugh ! but i d want to redraw them all , i wouldn t want them to be exactly ben s aliens , so probably not for the current streams","201449":"lol . too true","201450":"probably","201451":"and yet i still want a bandai figure","201452":"i haven t thought of any more yet","201453":"it sure was","201454":"i m not sure what i think . people have sent me some links to fanart . it s an interesting concept i guess","201455":"it s an interesting idea , i think it s possible","201456":"time has stopped for them in my mind since the series ended","201457":"yes , rodimus and his whole crew survived . you can see them alive and well in the stunticon comic","201458":"he s in the null void","201459":"no","201460":"only pear shaped","201461":"how was this implied ?","201462":"it was the static crew discussing it","201463":"not that i remember","201464":"hourly","201465":"chupacabras are not universal monsters or able to be in the omnitrix","201466":"yep","201467":"do they breath ?","201468":"oh well too bad i didn t read this first i guess","201469":"if i m understanding the question i think you re taking the idea that they evolved through war too literally . there was no actual war on an actual planet . it s all just digitally simulated in the watch s software . it s all ones and zeroes i didn t understand the part of the question about why the species being extinct would affect the omnitrix wearer","201470":"i didn t do any actual writing , but i was there for every story break and involved in coming up with arcs , plots , characters and other stuff","201471":"yes probably","201472":"this one ?","201473":"they did discuss it at one point . i remember seeing a line up","201474":"dracula !","201475":"no clue","201476":"decontaminate","201477":"she does a lot to keep dwayne s memory alive too","201478":"ah , i never even thought of looking there","201479":"charlotte is awesome","201480":"no thank you !","201481":"no , i m a fan of dwayne s work and he was a work friend . i like a lot of his writing especially jlu , i just didn t agree with all the retcons he and glen made . dwayne would probably like omniverse more than people assume since his wife and best friend were story editors . i think he liked their work","201482":"i tried to get a list of all those pop up facts a couple times but never got them","201483":"yes ! i worked with dwayne on teen titans while he was on a break from static . the titans and static shock and the batman crews were all in one big area on the same floor at wb . i cocreated control freak with dwayne he was based on an idea dwayne had for his comics but never used . his office was close to my cubicle and i used to hang out with him sometimes .","201484":"well that s probably why i don t remember then !","201485":"true true","201486":"i thought i remembered that episode well . i should have been more diligent with my research and had her included .","201487":"i don t remember anymore . since i didn t remember she existed at all i was probably confused by the question","201488":"yes i try to stay away from it generally . i delete tons of questions about them","201489":"i looked it up on the wiki , and what it looks like to me is someone asked if she was going to be in omniverse and i replied no . it was a short and vague answer","201490":"nope","201491":"that is bizarre","201492":"just because we forgot about her and didn t include her doesn t mean she doesn t exist off screen . we want to be as in line with the original series as possible . she would be human","201493":"no they were saying that she was gwen s daughter","201494":"how is that supposed to help ?","201495":"how can kenny be brothers with gwen s daughter ?","201496":"i ve never seen where gwen has a daughter","201497":"i think azmuth would know better than me !","201498":"green rath could be cool","201499":"huh ? i m lost","201500":"he would never be able to stay snare oh anywhere near long enough for the years of study required","201501":"like silver iron man with handles on his head","201502":"i don t think i relate to any of the students really . i relate to slughorn","201503":"magical dragons with wings also exist . i m not sure which chinese dragons are","201504":"yes","201505":"neither , we just couldn t figure out how to make him more interesting","201506":"no , we didn t have access to all dc characters and they didn t really want to have too many connections to batman , so robin could stand on his own","201507":"tokyo","201508":"i m not sure if those exist in the same way in animated . either way they are all still cybertronians , in the same way that if tetramands settled on galvan they would still be tetramands","201509":"nope","201510":"i found this question mind boggling , i didn t understand any of it","201511":"give me my money !","201512":"the man who shot liberty valance","201513":"i hate physical aliens coming out of the watch . that s just not the way the omnitrix works . it transforms the dna of the user , it doesn t create matter from nothing","201514":"no","201515":"autobots were created as workers without the ability to fly , decepticons were created as a military with built in weapons and flight capabilities","201516":"i m not sure what their title is but they have had had female leaders","201517":"only those trained in magic","201518":"fasttrack is the lamest , just because he s so redundant and similar to xlr , yet so much less interesting with a much more generic human design","201519":"i didn t even know he could make a shield . they sure liked giving those guys weird secondary powers the used once or twice","201520":"it s the only part of the movie he pays attention to","201521":"the dceu","201522":"that s a cool idea","201523":"usually i get paid for that","201524":"you can t tell anything like that from that inbetween","201525":"he d probably try for optimus or bumblebee","201526":"class","201527":"yes","201528":"space kook","201529":"chupacabra","201530":"no","201531":"it s hard to imagine what the evil opposite of brown is","201532":"no , he was supposed to use all original perkins designs","201533":"none originally planned","201534":"yes","201535":"it only contains what was seen in the show","201536":"you re going to have to use your imagination for that one , i don t think i could describe it well other than it would look like the infected machine in the episode with a more optimus like silhouette","201537":"ha ! totally !","201538":"i remember a guard in the museum is it that one ?","201539":"there isn t an existing kraaho i would use for a ben transformation","201540":"these are the kind of links that don t work for me here","201541":"it s not high on my list but i ll try to keep it in mind","201542":"nope","201543":"does every human have a hydrogen bomb ?","201544":"i couldn t find any of the models you asked for . the titans models are hard to search and i don t have everything","201545":"so he can hold his eyes in his hands ?","201546":"lol okay","201547":"okay , i ll keep that in mind","201548":"you can make a suggestion sure","201549":"i don t think he knows too many outside of ben s circles","201550":"only in the hands of an elite few","201551":"did you raise your hand ?","201552":"nope","201553":"he d be like michael bay !","201554":"the amount of resources","201555":"yes definitely , we always wanted to do more max patelliday","201556":"alien w","201557":"oh , no . i left the show halfway through the second season . i was wondering if that was something named for jim krieg , i guess it was","201558":"what ?","201559":"i can see it for the sake of variety or to fit into a terrain or story part , but not from a powers perspective , that s just silly","201560":"they need to breath","201561":"it s early but it s the strangest opinion i ve heard today","201562":"he s an accountant , and he has a treadmill desk","201563":"oh , now you re changing your story !","201564":"it would be difficult , when i m working from home i don t have a cintiq or even photoshop so i wouldn t be able to give drawn notes like usual . and my experience with rd party companies has never been great . i m much too spoiled from having worked on the real stuff","201565":"why would that even be on the table for consideration ?","201566":"we did a lobster ? ?","201567":"there should be a masked wrestler called el pior","201568":"vomiton !","201569":"i like those","201570":"aw upchuck and ghostfreak didn t translate well","201571":"the person to talk to about fusions is tom perkins","201572":"no , that was my transformation not ben s","201573":"it s possible i suppose","201574":"let it burn","201575":". . . huh ?","201576":"if he did i don t have it","201577":"they were well intentioned but disrespectful to the art and story of the show with their amateurish additions that contradict our intentions for the series","201578":"i think norm ryang designed it based on youngberg s concepts","201579":"there was this doodle also . i pretty much forgot about these ideas once we got into full production","201580":"the omnitrix was designed before i started","201581":"fish","201582":"beast boy","201583":"the current master builder is male","201584":"it would have cosmically amplified pain

the crap they added on their own","201601":"i guess they d never seen a mechamorph before . if i would have been shown that i would have rejected it","201602":"i m not familiar","201603":"we never discussed it","201604":"i never asked","201605":"i don t know for sure but i would assume they keep them .","201606":"doesn t sound familiar","201607":"that species doesn t exist in the

of the toys in various stages of production . sometimes i made notes to help the toys be more on model . but i m sure bandai kept working on things for a little while after i was finished on the show that i didn t get to see","201613":"the ones i have all have tiny numbers printed on them , they are production samples which are a stage after prototypes but before full production . i don t know if
