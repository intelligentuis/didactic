You would have a family that is hardworking, compassionate towards the things they love and talented in many areas such as music and construction related things. You're aunts would be the ones who share their passion for music with you if you wanted to, or your uncles would teach you the ways to living life on the wild side (sports, camping, fishing, driving four wheels or you can have a jam out session with michael and play guitar). Your grandpa would be the fun goofy one who you adore and grandma would be the one with a generous heart who would probably always make you snacks and spoil you lol.

A lot of things are so uncertain for so many. It\u2019s easy to lose hope when you look at the world and you see so much darkness. We want to bring some light through every project we\u2019re doing right now. Even if that\u2019s just through a T shirt you wear to bed or a sweatshirt you just wear around the house for now. Although for some, your physical health and financial security might not be at risk, we know that self isolation can be really hard on mental health, and that a lot of you feel alone right now. We want to remind you that you\u2019re not alone. We\u2019re all in this together and we\u2019ll make it through this. Introducing the Believe In You Handwritten Collection. Each piece features an uplifting lyric from our song Believe In You, with designs drawn by Dani and words handwritten by Katherine. Coming this Saturday, 4\/11 at 11:00am EST.

I kept playing it over and over in my head so I would remember it and could record it as soon as I got home. I tend to be a little bit obsessive so when I say \u201call I do is think about you these days\u201d it\u2019s not an overstatement. Unfortunately you can\u2019t control who stays and who leaves and even when you try your hardest but you can\u2019t always control your mind and stop yourself from thinking about someone when they do leave. I think loss is one of the hardest things to understand. It just doesn\u2019t make sense how someone could be there one day and be gone the next. I think we sometimes think that if we could just think about it enough and go through the story over and over and over, one day we\u2019ll understand what happened and what went wrong and how to move forward. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s how it works though. Some things just don\u2019t make sense and that\u2019s the only answer there is.
