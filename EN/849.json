medium ios , and why ?"},"Answer":{"785325":"that would be cool to do but sadly we have tried to work with various tv networks through out the years on a series and it didnt work out . we have done a short comedy webseries called summer with cimorelli with awesomeness tv and a real life webseries about our move to tennessee and trying to find our place in a new town called life as cimorelli and even had parts in a movie called , hope springs eternal . we also have met the jonas brothers , opened a show for them as well , but lisa would probably cry again aha","785326":"i dont have any","785327":"im obsessed with her new album . theres a few songs of hers that wasnt my cup of tea but overall of her music is good . like i wasnt a huge fan of blank space or her more darker trend","785328":"going to reanswer this , since i feel way better and can actually sit down and focus instead of trying to do three things at once . they are human . we make mistakes . even the leaders of our countries have made mistakes and our role models because nothing in life is perfect , but what we jhst consider to be good enough . the boys are still young ranging from mid s down to . they are still learning who they want to be and what they want to do and their message . which can take years to figure out and tons of experimenting . trust me i know . im it took us two years to figure out our style and to find our voice after being let down by the la music industry . it took us years to find out what our passion and purpose was . growing up in the spotlight isnt easy as well as you may think it is . youre under the spotlight , you dont get to be a normal kid because your life now revolves around impressing others such as the fans , the labels , the managers and partnerships . you dont have time to go out and play with friends in the mud and live out your reckless side by racing eachother down the street on your bike . you don t have the freedom to say certain things like a kid would because it will backfire and be held over your head for years . . for example look at the paul brothers probably the most hated youtubers there is idk . but jake does stuff that is dumb and reckless and the media and that hold it over his head for years and call him a bad person for just doing something he thought was fun or cool . so think about the guys . . . they dont get to live out their childhood or have fun like everyone else does because this is their lives now and they are always in the spotlight being watched on every move they make . . . because no one has the respect to just let them be happy and have fun and do what they love . you guys criticize everything they do because you dont agree with it . you dont want them to make mistakes like a normal human being does and learn from it . or you dont even sit down and think for a second what they deal with on a day to day basis or how they feel . you think you know their personal lives like the alphabet and get upset when they decide to keep things personal because you guys intrude on it . you guys dont respect how hard they work for you , to put on a show , to put out music , to even try their hardest to atleast make you guys hapoy . but youre to focus on who they hang out with , who their girlfriends are , what they done in their past , them vaping , them being rude because they mightve had a hard day . you guys never take their feelings into consideration . another thing is they spend so much time away from their families of the time and only see them a few times out of the year you guys never think that maybe theyre homesick as well ? cba i love these boys so much . and if you cant take their feelings into consideration then you dont deserve to be in the fandom . comparing a person to another is just wrong on another topic . plp","785329":"a year ago","785330":"im not","785331":"halloween horror night","785332":"very good .","785333":"i never really got into a

local little diner in town it was around i want to say pm and there were three females working and the cook . well the one girl was on break and getting ready to leave for the day . she told us we could sit wherever , and she will take our order for the drinks pop , water , juuce etc . and our server will be with us in a minute . the girl was super polite and professional . the server i dont have much postive feedback on . she acted like she didnt even want to work , in the back talking the entire time , and then what made me mad was the other girl who helped us earlier seen a old couple walk in and told them they could sit wherever they want as the place wasnt that busy . the server walked out and told them she will be with them in a second but rilled her eyes and said in a very snotty way or not . then when my mother went to go pay after we had finished eating the server once again was very unprofessional by having a snotty attitude about taking the coupon off . my mom didnt tip her because of the way she was acting . she also didnt do her job like she should have , leaving the other girl to take care of the customers or having to call her out if her customers needed something . just was highly disrespectful and i dont think we will visit there for awhile .","785335":"never knew","785336":"scream in agony","785337":"yeah","785338":"i have no idea .","785339":"i

posted a this week with lauren in a minute and that s because to be honest , the last few weeks have been really difficult for me . these pictures are all the good and fun times i had , but there was so much hard stuff going on in between each one . i ve always been a very private , emotionally repressed , conflict averse person and i had to deal with a lot of things in the last few weeks that required a lot of me emotionally . such as tuning into myself and diving into a lot of painful deep dark feelings that i would have loved to just avoid , having a lot of really hard and vulnerable conversations with people i really care about , asking for what i need emotionally from people when i m used to just taking care of all my needs myself , standing up for myself and setting boundaries , and having to trust people and let go of control when i have always been a very skeptical and controlling person lol just want to remind everyone that life is not a walk in the park for any of us . and that it s okay . you don t have to be at your best all the time . you don t have to be strong for everyone else . you don t have to pretend like everything s fine and continue on with this crushing weight on top of you all the time . it s okay to take a beat , to take a minute , to take a day , a week , a month , whatever it is and just repair yourself . not push yourself . r e p a i r yourself . you re not letting everyone down , you re just honoring yourself .","785858":"its my profile , i can do what i want . if you re so unhappy unfollow me and have a nice life

without the pics . right as it was happening i thought , i am going to die . . . i could die right now . i closed my eyes as i experienced the feeling of smashing into a car and the airbag opening , and that loud , loud sound that accompanied it . . . . then i opened them and i was alive . i called and opened my mouth to talk and nothing came out . . . the woman who answered was saying things but i couldn t tell what she was saying . luckily , a man appeared at my window and grabbed my phone and talked to her and told her what was going on . the accident continued to flash through my mind every other minute as everything went on and as nick drove me home from getting checked out , his phone went off super loud on his car stereo and i instantly burst into tears from the loud noise . i just kept repeating i m scared i m scared i could have died for a long time up until i finally fell asleep that night . . . . only to wake up in the middle of the night to my ears ringing and the accident flashing through my mind again and again . the last couple days i was very tired , sore , bruised and just very subdued and contemplative . i realized just how grateful i am to be alive , that no one was hurt and that i can wake up and breathe every single day . it blows my mind to think that i could have not been here . . . . but here i am . i m so grateful to all the first responders including my husband second picture who were there immediately to help us all and keep everyone safe . i wanted to post this as a reminder to wear your seatbelt and that you never know when you will

one or whatever","785914":"at times not always","785915":"you have a good night im probably going to go see emmyn s show with the oso osos , sidekicks and future teens in a few hours . or hang out with the lads aka rachael , kiera , arielle and them","785916":"not agreeing or disagreeing . or saying youre right or wrong , but the only person who can change anything is you . yourself . if you dont like your hair you go to get it cut , if you dont like your outfit , you get a new one , if you dont like your career you look for better . etc . so emmyn didnt really change her . . . she changed herself . also little rewind , dani was when she became a part of the band and into the publics eye . she could never be an actual child , as well as me and do or say certain things because she would get criticized for it and people wouldnt agree . she was hated on for being skinny as a child , to pale , to talkative , to bossy seeming , annoying and told she wasnt a good singer . we been on the internet for over years so think how long it has been . she also got compared to me and the other sisters about who can sing better and whose the most prettiest and more to be sucessful . so this may be why she decides to change her hair styles up , change the color , cut it short , have bangs , dye it etc . and why she changed her style so many times as well . she tried to be edgy to make friends and get more people to like her . she also was really inlove with someone and he hurt her pretty badly as well as a friend of ours at the time . this is why she cried on stage , wrote many songs about him and then to have deja vu all have it repeated in the same way with someone else ? she lost her confidence , her self worth , self love and it has been years trying to get her to feel happy and confident again . she has spoken about how she cant even log onto twitter anymore without seeing messages and tweets about people being so rude to her expecially the harmonizers fans at the time . so in a way i think emmyn has taught her how to love and be confident again in herself , maybe theres a deeper meaning to this on why shes doing it or bottled up emotions that are finally coming out and the only way she can express these is by changing herself and telling her story through the changes","785917":"thats good to hear","785918":"a haha funnyyyy anyone who actually knows me knows im not a judgemental person . im very kind and forgiving unless you hurt me or do something i cant forgive u for . talking about me is something i can deal with . but talking about someone i
