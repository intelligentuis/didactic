  lol it can be loud . depends on where you are. if your in nyc then it’s loud. if you go farther east towards the Hampton’s and stuff it’s kinda quiet cuz it’s more country . restaurants aren’t cheap what’s so ever and the cost of living is ridiculous. ppl usually move out of ny cuz it’s to expensive. my rent is 1400 for 2 bedrooms . and it’s cold but i like the cold tbh. if you live in a warm climate or lived in a warm climate area for years then maybe you wouldn’t like the weather in the fall // winter. right now it’s 32° lol. but it’s beautiful 😻

   Since you became pregnant with her, she's very clearly existed to you. Giving her a better life than what you could at the given time doesn't mean you're ""pretending she doesn't exist."" Other women who give their children up for adoption very clearly know they exist. 🤦🏽‍♀️

   You can't call yourself white if you're black and look black and aren't even close to your white family. Just say you're black, it's not that hard. Again, you have self hate issues.

728015,"
   It doesn't matter. If you had to check ONE box (like it was for decades), a black/white person always checked black, because that's the dominant race and what people saw them as. Why make things complicated by telling people you're not black. Logic.

  you can’t make sense logically

   yo just because your man is black and your kids are majority black doesn't make you black tf is wrong with them. you're still mixed and your kids are a quarter white because you're mixed. a white woman can't have a full black child, her child is BIRACIAL. two black parents make a black baby. simple

  "
728024,"
   You literally have a BLACK family and are trying to say you're not black lmfao. You definitely don't look like your mom or anything close to white, keep dreaming. I bet you're ashamed of your father's blackness which is why you won't say you're black, how sad.
  ","
  you sound dumb .
  
  what if my family was white and i married a white man and had white kids. would that make me black?
  
  what if my family was spanish and i married a spanish man . that means i’m spanish.
  
  what if my family was Asian. and i married an Asian? does that mean i’m Asian?
  
  cuz that’s your logic ???
  "
728025,"
   No one is mentally unstable. It's the one drop rule, get over it. Everyone knows society, especially American society, views you as a BLACK WOMAN. You're not special or cute for that mixed label. Get over yourself and your self hate issues and claim your blackness.

   No one is MAD that they're not lightskinned, that's what you want so you can feel superior than us. You know what I'm saying is true. You think just because you have a white blonde Karen mama you're suddenly a new race when you have a black man and black kids and look more like your dad.

  "

   I'm actually a black woman. I'm just telling you the truth. I don't know why lightskinned girls think they're all that and deny their blackness but still hang around us to feel superior when they want to be black, and date black men and have black kids. Admitting you're black isn't bad.
