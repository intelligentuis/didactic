cool","779791":"i actually like chad . max is okay he s more on the quiet side","779792":"idk . one of us are bound to leave sometime and its going to happen eventually . but we don t know who . lisa tried to break the band up before , we went to group therapy . i tried leaving , multiple times only to be told to sit down and talk it out , there was rumors last year about christina leaving once she got married or pregnant","779793":"kath and max were together for a year as well , and lisa and chad","779794":"but i feel like dani may leave the band soon as well . . . she just doesn t seem as

well because they went out of state for the week","779803":"yeah she got married the th","779804":"with dani being married , us not saying anything , but comgrstulating the others . and so on","779805":"basically we feel like the whole thing was rushed and he s taken advantage of dani . meaning that dani was in a very vulnerable place a year ago with still going through the heartbreak to finding out who she was . as you know she had a breakdown because the hate becane to much as well . she was starting to get better . kallen , our childhood bestfriend actually loved dani and that is why he moved and lived with us for a year because he tried chasing after dani . he confessed his feelings for her back home in california for christinas wedding amd for awhile it was always about kallen and them hanging out . and she even wrote as a caption saying lisa made her were she was inside kallens tesla , that she was going marry kallen one day and didnt care what any of us had to say . which dad commented under it hey now young lady with the cool face emoji . and everything seemed fine . then around this time is when emmyn was contacting her , blowing up her phone while she was trying to enjoy time with us . like he was literally being obsessive . and she suddenly started seeing emmyn as well . kallen moved back to california and really hasnt said much to us since then . that was just the start of it , notice at the reception we did back in tennessee kallen was by me or arielle the entire time . kallen also posted that he missed his wifey and someone tagged emmyn in it asking how does he feel about it and emmyn said he does not approve and was upset . danielle turned , and a lot of you know we do everything together and always been the closest because sugar spice and we were like the twins . she moved in with emmyn his family . you think she would ve moved in with me and amy ? because we always shared a room together growing up , it was lisa , me and her . then when we moved to tennessee it was only me and her as the only daughters left in the house . so that s where it kinda seemed weird . then she like stopped coming around to do family stuff with us or hangout we only see her if its like a band meeting , a big function like a birthday or we are on tour now , and that s another weird thing . because danielle and i used to hang out all the time and now its just amy and i who lives together and hangs out together sometimes lisa . also given her age and seeing how she changed so much rebellious like it just seems like its not really going to last . . and its rushed and she s just going with everything emmyn wants because she s afraid to be hurt or whatever again . or like he wants ties to dani for some reason . and lately it just seems like the dani we know isn t really there . . .","779806":"i ll explain here in a sec","779807":"i think we all kinda knew but be reminded we were told next year or next month as well . and lisa was also sick this past weekend and both lisa and i went out of state","779808":"mhm","779809":"none of us have even commented on the engagement . because it seems like emmyn doesnt want to be around us for

just don t know how to be respectful , use their brain , or even read for that matter . tnmorz and i have been dating since september , minus whatever rumors you may hear because of media and certain people invading privacy and twisting things around . but anyway i m getting tired of seeing certain animals questions being sent to whysomanytaken who is tristen s half brother . consisting of things like would he date me and so on , no he won t because i m dating his brother , never had romantic feelings for him , and he has his own girlfriend . stop being those type of people who try to break people up because you re unhappy with your life . its also annoying how anytime i even mention tristen you guys like to point out he s gay , i m better looking . no offense but i think tristen is adorable , he s good enough for me , and no he s not gay . as for the anons in my inbox telling me to break up with him and date them never im perfectly content with my relationship and i don t date just anyone . i have to feel comfortable and actually know you for starters . and for the anons who have a weird obsession with jonah marais . . . that s never going to happen , jonah is the exact boyfriend of one of my sisters and he hurt her pretty badly . yes he may have grown up , but i will never date him or anything . and jonah also has a girlfriend who he s been with for years as well

the last stop of the believe in you tour on saturday night and let me tell you i have never slept more than i have in the last days ! ! ! ! ! this has been the most challenging and hectic month months of maybe my entire life . it s like just when you think everything will calm down , there s something else ! ! ! did not foresee all of this . been working with my therapist a lot on using healthy coping strategies to deal with stress and big emotions . definitely don t always employ these strategies , but things like being honest with myself , taking time to process my thoughts and feelings and allowing myself to feel those feelings and have those thoughts , and setting boundaries that i need to keep myself healthy mentally and physically even though it might inconvenience other people have been coming in clutch . i think the holidays the end of the year is pretty hard for a lot of people . a lot of you guys have your finals for school right now , being around family can be really stressful , or trying to celebrate when you ve lost a loved one or come from a broken home , or even just having your own personal struggles and not being able to enjoy what s supposed to be the happiest time of year can be really hard . you re not alone guys . and you don t have to pretend like everything s fine when it s not . it s okay to feel exactly however it is that you feel and there s nothing wrong with you for feeling that way p . s . the last video is from something really special we filmed","780241":"i think everyone hates those like lotion and that sets lol","780242":"i think
