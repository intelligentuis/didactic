we know , but sisterhood comes first and we will always be sisters . this wasnt a rushed decision and nothing bad happened . she just wanted something different and we are glad she has been with us for the years as she has done so much and impacted everyone in a positive way . no its not because of her husband this is something she has wanted for a long time . and we supoort her choice and will support her through it . however so much will change , and there will be a blank space and a missing puzzle piece . but dani will still be involved with the cimfam , either randomly appearing in videos or supporting the new music , or cheering us on from the crowds . we didnt force her or kick her out of the band . and the door will always be open for her to come back if she wants . but the band is not leaving , we are going into as a five piece . kinda like it was when we first started youtube then added our brother michael in for a while then dani joined in . . . . so please no hate comments about any of this and understand that we are all hurting and upset because none of us wanted this and like dani says in before octobers gone , maybe sometimes things just have to end . but she will still be active on social media and if you want to continue supporting us as a five piece thank you but you can also support dani and follow her journey daniandemmyn on
