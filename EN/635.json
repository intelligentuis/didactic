The day i was born, he took an 18 year commitment to take care of me and be the big brother i need. Even though he was suppose to be having his own childhood. Hes the reason ive become who i am today. He taught me excatly what people do\/dont like and its coasted me through life. i remember i never left his side, what he wanted to do i was doing it too.\n  \n  My sister is 27 shes a little more complicated then my brother. Shes a harder person to live with. She has the mind of a genius but shes too focused on living a spontaneous life. She marked and scarred by what my parents went through in their divorce that theirs a chance she wont be getting married and she's also a lesbian. My sister hated me growing up, she said I was the perfect daughter. Beautiful, skinny, blonde, and blue eyes. Our relationship wasn't a good one until I became old.
