  Para Mi El amor es aquél sentimiento que un ser produce en tí, por el cuál, tú llegas a ver las cosas desde una perspectiva diferente en la cual tus pensamientos son más lúcidos. (claro, tambien hay gente que se entorpece) pero por lo regular cuando el amor llega a ti, haces las más conciencia pues el temor de llegar a fracasar y desilusionar a esa persona es más grande que cualquier otra cosa. En ocaciones lo único que mueve el sentido de la vida es el amor, aquella esperanza de sentirse en armonía uno con otro. El sentimiento más puro, aquél que no ve condiciones sociales ni económicas

  El amor es aquél sentimiento que un ser produce en tí, por el cuál, tú llegas a ver las cosas desde una perspectiva diferente en la cual tus pensamientos son más lúcidos. (claro, también hay gente que se entorpece) pero por lo regular cuando el amor llega a ti, haces las más conciencia pues el temor de llegar a fracasar y desilusionar a esa persona es más grande que cualquier otra cosa. En ocasiones lo único que mueve el sentido de la vida es el amor, aquella esperanza de sentirse en armonía uno con otro. El sentimiento más puro, aquél que no ve condiciones sociales ni económicas, capaz de enfrentar cualquier tipo críticas......

  Sin Duda El Amor
  
  El amor es sufrido, es benigno; el amor no tiene envidia, el amor no es jactancioso, no se envanece; no hace nada indebido, no busca lo suyo, no se irrita, no guarda rencor; no se goza de la injusticia, mas se goza de la verdad. Todo lo sufre, todo lo cree, todo lo espera, todo lo soporta. El amor nunca deja de ser.

  ","
  Te plantea accesar a conocimientos generados detrás y antes de las religiones (cristianismo e islam por ejemplo)
  
  Te permite tener un conocimiento más amplio el cual arroja madurez, evitando caer en los rebaños de las religiones colectivas o en la intolerancia del fanatismo religioso.
  
  Las vivencias son diferentes a las creencias y se colocan en un plano superior, la metafísica busca esas vivencias a través del conocimiento previo, el cual no puede estar pelado con una energía suprema de armonía o creación asi como su caótico opuesto, mismos que no son entes diferentes, son una unidad.
  
  La metafísica te plantea la evolución de como éstos opuestos han sido interpretados, vividos y trasgiversados, tomando de base las leyes que rigen el universo
  
  No Me Meteria  En El tema La Vedad No Me Interesa

   q piensas sobre el amor... *___*
  ","
  El amor es aquél sentimiento que un ser produce en tí, por el cuál, tú llegas a ver las cosas desde una perspectiva diferente en la cual tus pensamientos son más lúcidos. (claro, tambien hay gente que se entorpece) pero por lo regular cuando el amor llega a ti, haces las más conciencia pues el temor de llegar a fracasar y desilucionar a esa persona es más grande que cualquier otra cosa. En ocaciones lo único que mueve el sentido de la vida es el amor, aquella esperanza de sentirse en armonía uno con otro. El sentimiento más puro, aquél que no ve condiciones sociales ni económicas, capaz de enfrentar cualquier tipo críticas

  i mean ... if you can afford it on your own, then you're free to do what you want to do. i understand not wanting to do household chores due to depression, though. sometimes it does alleviate symptoms when you do try to commit to certain tasks, though (depending on the person). even if you try to do one small task a day, it'll provide you with a sense of accomplishment.

   I think it’s incredibly arrogant to think you know it all and leave no room for other opinions and experiences. Mental health isn’t mathematics. In math you know 2+2=4 and it’s not up for discussion. Mental health is way more complex, there’s many shades, nuances, experiences, etc. So

  even though you have a master's degree in mental health research (or counseling or what your occupation is in), that doesn't mean there isn't more room for education or improvement.

  i'm not ""challenging"" you, lol. i've been conducting research into mental illness since i was a teenager because that's how long i've had mental health issues. you evidently don't know me very well and you're only basing your opinion of me off of that one solitary response.
  "
377066,"
   Let me explain love. Symptoms here or there are defined as “situational “ which is most likely associated with depression. To some depression is temporary or situational to others. It comes and goes in what is defined in “episode “ which is associated with the a diagnosis of   “bipolar “
  ","
  there are also people who don't experience depression, though. to claim that *everyone* has a mental illness is a bit ignorant and erases the struggles people with mental illness actually face.

  ","
  yeah, that sounds slightly arrogant to me. just because you're a teacher or a professor in a particular subject doesn't necessarily mean you know *everything* there is to know about that subject -- especially when it comes to lgbtq+, racism, and feminist issues. ideas in those realms are constantly changing and evolving, especially now with the influence of social media.

  ","
  privilege depends on a variety of factors and there are different types of privilege. if anything, you probably benefit from financial privilege (or something similar) because you do have a stable income and have parents who financially support you.
  
  even without COVID, that's a hell of a lot better than a lot of people in general because you don't struggle with financial instability.

  i'm glad we're taking him in. this morning, an unknown person literally dropped him in a cage off in front of my ex's job (he works with animals) with a note saying ""sorry, we couldn't afford to take care of him anymore because of COVID."" so my ex texts our group chat & immediately my roommate and i express interest. so he's setting the bunny up with a vet appointment with a specialist, and the vet also runs a sanctuary, so the vet will give us the paperwork to adopt the bunny after his check up. he seems like he might have medical issues, but that's perfectly okay.

  "
377601,"
   How do you cope with some of the intrusive and blatantly rude messages you get about your body, tattoos, your past relationship etc?
  ","
  it doesn't affect me emotionally because 99% of the time, they're from anonymous strangers who have absolutely no idea about my life, what i've been through, etc. in those cases, they're usually projecting their own insecurities onto me, otherwise they wouldn't feel the need to critique a total stranger.
  "
377602,"
   That makes sense.  Thanks for answering :) Can I ask what you prefer?

  tbh i don't like compliments in general, lol. but i do prefer neutral over gendered language more than anything else (sometimes if i'm feeling more masculine then i accept masculine compliments too).

   Have you ever had a friendship that ended for of a stupid reason?
  ","
  pretty sure my friendship with my coworker ended last night over the fact that i didn't respond to her snapchat message. but it is what it is.
  "
377604,"
   I'm really sorry if this is a dumb question but I'm honestly not sure - are there preferred compliments that nonbinary people are more comfortable with?  Since it seems like a lot of compliments are genered (""pretty,"" ""handsome,"" ""beautiful,"" etc.)
  ","
  it isn't dumb at all. ultimately, it comes down to each individual person — some NB people may prefer more feminine compliments over masculine, or vice versa, or neutral compliments even too. your best bet if you're unsure is to ask them what they prefer prior to complimenting them.

   1/2. Everyone has a bad day or two. You maybe need to remind yourself of a few things. First, you are good at your job. Everyone screws up now and again, you can and will get back on track. Secondly, some people randomly do shitty things. You deserve better and will be better off without them.
  ","
  (cont) ... Obviously my words won't magically make things better, but I hope it helps to be reminded that you are awesome and bad days don't negate the good days and progress.

  thank you -- i genuinely do appreciate this. the stupid thing is, i *know* i'm being super hard on myself but i can't ease myself out of that irrational line of thinking, lol. i've talked to a few people about what my friend said to me prior to her basically cutting contact and they said she was wrong, which is what i thought too, so i'm kinda at the point now where i'm thinking ""whatever happens, happens."" if she stops being my friend, then so be it.
  
  i called out of work today even though i was supposed to attend a small meeting this morning regarding one of my projects. i've always been somewhat insecure about my performance at work and it's taking everything in me to not text my supervisor and ask her how the meeting this morning went, haha.

  make sure you're going to a reputable artist (sometimes it helps to visit their instagram pages or read reviews online). always pay for the tip in cash because then it goes right into their pockets. don't be afraid to tell the artist that you might need a minute to collect yourself if a certain spot is too painful -- it's okay to take breaks.

  it's probably different from person-to-person, considering how unpredictable askfm's algorithms are these days. as for why it's happening ... who knows. the most likely answer would be a glitch in their system, but i'm not tech savvy by any means, so i'm just taking a wild guess.

   Wait, how do you know it hasnt been sent out yet? In my experience they get sent out straight away. I know this because I start getting notifs after an hour or so, then I start getting notifs two weeks later so I know they’ve sent it again. I’ve also asked ppl when they’ve received it.
  ","
  because nobody has answered it yet. sometimes my shout outs get sent out immediately, but most of the time, they don't and i get those answers weeks after the fact. because i like maintaining my VIP status, i do send out the 25 shout outs per week and most of those questions aren't answered by anybody at all.
  
  i really think askfm has set up some sort of queue, or something, because of how much traffic there is now regarding shout outs and VIP.

378047,"
   What do you think about people who visit a new country without trying to learn at least some of the language?
  ","
  it isn't any of my concern, so i don't have strong opinions on it at all. learning a new language is entirely up to that person, especially if they're just visiting and not planning to stay long-term. however, if that person is moving to another country where they speak a different language, then it would be beneficial for that person to learn the language (or at least some and pick up on more of the language through living there daily).

  "
378053,"
   They should have told us either way, I will be closing my account because of it. It is an “easy” fix because as I mentioned before it’s a recent thing. They want to increase use/traffic but all they are doing is annoying tf out of everyone.
  ","
  i agree that it is super aggravating -- for example, i sent a shout out like two to three weeks ago asking people what they believe will happen on inauguration day in the united states, and it hasn't even been sent out yet, so it's going to look super silly when it *does* get sent out ... whenever that will be.

  i'm not interested in dating, so it's pretty irrelevant to me right now. i will say this, though, i don't find bodybuilders or really huge muscles to be attractive at all -- that's just my personal preference. other than that, it really doesn't matter to me.
  "
378057,"
   Have you contacted ask.fm help about what they’re doing with shoutouts now? I have but they were useless and “Stacy” didn’t read/comprehend my question. It’s annoying af to have my shoutouts sent out multiple times/weeks later. They never used to.
  ","
  i haven't reached out to askfm, no. it's honestly happening to pretty much everyone who uses the shout out feature, so i'm not sure if it's an ""easy"" fix. but either way, they definitely should have done a trial run with the VIP feature before implementing it to have prevented stuff like this from happening.

   My boyfriend and I had a disagreement the other day. I was of the opinion that celebrities are overpaid and don't deserve that much money. While other hardworking professions are underpaid. my bf says celebs also work hard, maintain their bodies, and shoot for movies thats taxing. What's your take?
  ","
  i can see both sides, but the main issue is that celebrities have the privilege of having extra help in their work. for example, when maintaining their bodies, they have a team of nutritionists or personal chefs or trainers who guide them every step of the way. while shooting for movies or shows or performing music can be taxing on the body and mind, that doesn't detract from the mental and physical strain that other ""regular"" people go through in their own daily life.
  
  i think celebrities are overpaid, of course, and i think it's important for those celebrities to donate their money to good causes and contribute somehow to their communities in order to help the youth and working class climb the steps of the ladder easier.
  "
378302,"
   is university the ""highest"" form of education?
  ","
  in a professional sense, i believe so. however, in a personal sense, the highest form of education may not even be attainable because you can still learn even outside of the regular educational realm -- and knowledge is infinite.

   its so unfair how celebs have so much money and barely graduate high school and here we wanna go to university but can't because of how expensive it is
  ","
  a lot of celebrities are *super* privileged with respect to their wealth and power, and it's sad when they don't try to leverage that in order to help others. there are a good amount of celebrities who do contribute civically, i.e. donating money to foundations and nonprofits that help students go to school, but most millionaires and especially billionaires don't do so.

   is going to university a privilege

  high education in general is a privilege. in the united states at least, a lot of students can't pursue higher education because it's too expensive, even with loans and grants and scholarships. you still need to pay out-of-pocket for food and books.
  "
378315,"
   is it normal no desire to date and marry etc? I'm straight but I don't like the idea of being tied down. i very much prefer my own company at the end of the day and most people tire me out. is this normal?

  (cont) ... a child. adoption is an option i'd consider when the right time comes but having a biological child is a definite no no. they like the idea of adoption too but they want a biological child too. i just dont know what the future has in for us... is the separation inevitable?
  
  --
  
  i don't believe separation is inevitable, no. if your partner is open to adoption, then that's something you both do agree upon. however, they do have to understand your health and concerns as well, because raising a biological child when you aren't mentally or physically ready for it would be doing everybody a disservice (you, your partner, and that child).

   Is it ok to still like entertainment sources from the past that society looks down upon now? 

Examples: J.K. Rowling's content, Jackie Chan related content, anything even remotely related to Bill Cosby, etc. 

I don't agree with their methods viewpoints and actions, but I still enjoy their work
  ","
  i'm a bit undecided on this particular situation, but i'm more leaning towards the following (someone let me know if my thoughts aren't all there) ;
  
  sometimes, i believe it's okay to like certain things from problematic people -- *only* as long as you make it a point to recognize that they are problematic instead of, for example, denying it or making excuses for them. i.e., i've always been a huge harry potter fan but i know jk rowling is a piece of sh*t. despite that, i still recognize the tremendous effect her books have had on me and i still enjoy the movies and listening to the soundtracks. and that's okay.

  tbh i'm wondering if this was mass sent, because i haven't discussed politics on askfm in days, if not over a week. lmaoo.

  ","
  thank you. i'm really beginning to wrap my head around cutting ties with my family completely, it's all i've been thinking about all afternoon. i know i don't deserve to be treated this way, which is something that has also been difficult to acknowledge because from such a young age, i was conditioned to think it was unacceptable to do anything that was against my parents. but through therapy lately, my therapist and i have been discussing how my parents' treatment of me has always been terrible and i'm under no obligation to keep the peace with them if i don't want to.

  so said, ""no, what the f*ck is your problem now?"" then went on a two-paragraph tirade about how i'll never visit them when they move out of state, and finished the text with her writing in all caps, ""I'M TIRED OF BEING PATIENT WITH YOU.""
  
  so ... i'm just flat out done. i'm not going to respond to her messages, i'm letting her phone calls go to voicemail, etc etc. i'm done with putting up with this bullsh*t, and i can't wait until they *do* move out of state so that i don't have to deal with this anymore.

  i believe community college is a great alternative in general, regardless of the pandemic or whatnot. there's nothing wrong with attending community college for two-year programs, especially if a student is unsure of what they plan on studying. it provides them greater opportunities to delve deeper into their interests.
  
  gap years can be helpful too, particularly if the person finds a job and figures out whether or not that job(s) is worthy of their further study. everyone does education at their own pace.

  i understand the importance of protesting, so i'm not going to sit here and say ""don't go to protests ever,"" especially in light of the events that happened in 2020 regarding trump and BLM. however, wearing a mask during those protests is imperative and the least you can do to do your due diligence during these times.

  i've always been a relatively patient person when it comes to most people, so even when people are in front of me and exhibiting ignorance or even arrogance, it doesn't phase me. the most i can do is try to educate them, and if they're not willing to be educated, then that isn't my problem anymore.

  askfm also has different marketplace promos where you can promote your answers through paying for the service with coins, which i've done on a few occasions.

  yeah, i used to do independent studies into various topics all the time when i was younger, particularly when i was in college. i would be introduced to a concept that we would go over briefly in class, and so i would try to research more into the topic in depth on my own terms.
  "
378810,"
   Why is talking about mental illness a topic of taboo?
  ","
  there's a long historical context behind the stigma of mental illness -- basically, people who were mentally ill were often seen as ""hysterical"" or ""deranged,"" and would be institutionalized for life instead of being treated as human beings. even though society has progressed a lot since those times, the stigma against mental illness exists to an extent -- especially in terms of more complex disorders, like trauma disorders, dissociation, personality disorders, etc etc.
  
  a lot of people refuse to see mental health as a legitimate issue, and they often see it as ""lesser"" than physical health problems because mental illness is an invisible illness. that's why we need to progress more in mental health awareness.
  "
378811,"
   What are you known for in your family/friends? ?

  ","
  it seems difficult, but it is possible. don't base your own recovery off of what i reveal about mine. it's always worth it to take that step forward to better yourself, and everyone is different. what hasn't worked for me may work well for you. healing isn't linear.

   i'm not american so i cant comment on politics but you americans take everything so seriously. especially ordinary americans who dont count. only those IN THE POWER count. the working class isn't taken into consideration. so just get an ice cold beer and enjoy life. dont worry abt politics.
  ","
  people who live ordinary lives are affected by politics, whether they're conscious of it or not. although the wealthier 1% makes the majority of the decisions and are in power, the consequences of those decisions ultimately fall on the working and lower classes. it's a backwards system, unfortunately.
  
  so yeah — while some people have the privilege of sitting back & enjoying a beer, other people's lives are at stake based on politics and the decisions made through local and federal government.

   Why do a lot of people have very strong opinions about POLITICS even though they know very little about it?
  ","
  i think what's more concerning is when people have strong political opinions based on little information, and then express those opinions as if they *are* educated in politics -- especially if they're putting forth rhetoric that's just flat out inaccurate.
  
  politics is one of those hot subjects that everyone wants to have a say in, it's just the way people are.

  "
379051,"
   they are affecting my mental health but at the same i miss their company a lot. i tried to cut them off but i fall back for them.
  ","
  i understand this all too well. eventually, you have to tell yourself that you've become dependent on this person for your own ""happiness,"" but you're not actually happy with them. they continually hurt you, and to be frank, they probably know and are leveraging that to keep you close.
  "
379052,"
   how can I deal with someone who has a big ego, they are nice, I like them a lot but when we fight they never apologize. I talk to them before it but they just never change
  ","
  sometimes you have to weigh the pros and cons of being friends or in a relationship with this person -- or people like this in general. if it's detrimental to your well being or mental health, then you may be better off cutting them out of your life.
  
  in certain circumstances, people like this will eventually realize they're wrong, admit it, and work on themselves to being a better person. but if you have the sense that this will never happen with them, then you're under no obligation to continue associating with this person.
  "
379053,"
   What is your biggest challenge?
  ","
  my mental health.
  "
379054,"
   If you fall asleep while texting your bf an he's accusing you of cheating, is it wrong?
  ","
  well ... the fact that he's accusing you of cheating via text message instead of face-to-face is a bit immature and silly, ngl. i feel like that's the type of conversation worth having in person, not over messaging where it's easy to misconstrue meaning or feelings.
  "
379055,"
   What kind of people do you most enjoy hanging out with?
  ","
  people who are creative/artsy, passionate about their interests, mature and not willing to put up with bullsh*t or drama, etc etc. all of my friends have similar interests with me, which also helps a lot.

  "
379060,"
   I like honest answers even if they don't satisfy my thoughts lol. thanks for your opinion Leigh!
  ","
  haha, i mean if you are asking for advice -- i would really only quit a job without a backup as a last resort if it was affecting my health *that* badly, meaning i literally couldn't wait any longer.
  
  however, coming from my own personal experiences, even though the jobs i've had in the past were terrible, i still somehow stuck it out until i found a new job before putting my notice in. that alone was enough to kinda ""stabilize"" me a bit more, because if i quit a job without having a backup, then i would probably freak out even more.

  as for how i'd like to be shown love, i've taken quizzes that said that my primary love language is through words of affirmation. i like being told how much i mean to people, being validated for my thoughts and feelings, and being reassured.

  coming from someone who is mentally unstable (hi, that's me), one of the best things you can do is simply be there for them to offer support when they need it. whether they want to vent to you, have you there in quiet for comfort, or just having the knowledge that you're willing to help even if they haven't asked for help can be the difference between life and death.

  yeah, i was often (as in on a regular basis, almost daily) yelled at for a variety of stupid things, such as coupons being expired, items not ringing up on sale even though the sale had ended, the customer's credit card getting declined, the price of items in general and how they're ""cheaper in other stores,"" etc.
  
  management was relatively understanding, although my store manager was a mess and constantly expected the most out of everyone to the point where it was unrealistic. after i had put in my two weeks' notice, he called me on my last day of work and asked if i could work a 4-hour shift two weeks from that day even though i wasn't going to be with the company anymore & starting my new job already. he was ridiculous.
  "
379204,"
   Honestly, I'm really thankful for having a job. It sometimes gets stressful, demanding, tiring. I occasionally need some days off. But I still like it! I know a lot of people who lost their jobs and desperately need another but pandemic is making things extremely difficult. I for one I'm grateful.
  ","
  i wholeheartedly agree with you. i feel privileged to have been able to transition to working from home and keeping my job during the pandemic. so many people i know lost their jobs, got laid off or furloughed, etc etc. it's such a saddening and frustrating thing to see, and also for those people to go through on top of dealing with the pandemic itself.
  
  i like my job a lot, even though they had to make certain amends to salaries to remain afloat (they decreased our salaries by 10% across the board :/). i actually clocked out early at 3:00pm today because i had a huge anxiety attack and could barely breathe, and i'm lucky that i have the proper PTO to be able to do so in the first place.

  i don't really feel any particular way, but it makes me chuckle when cashiers and other retail workers tell people, ""you have to put the mask over your nose"" or ""if you don't put a mask on, i'm going to ask you to leave.""
  
  cashiers are given a lot of sh*t, especially now more than ever before, and it makes the former retail worker in me happy that cashiers now are advocating for safety and won't back down.

  my past, particularly in reference to my childhood trauma. i've been working closely with my therapist on past reflection and trauma healing, especially lately because i've been having flashbacks often (which has never happened before).
  
  idk. i feel stable and unstable at the same time -- if that makes sense? some days, i'm perfectly fine. other days, i'm falling apart at the seams and i'm flashing back constantly, can't sleep, turn into a manic mess, etc etc.

  ","
  well, i don't know if it applies anymore. because i've learned to enjoy it again. but the show ""supernatural.""
  
  i used to be obsessed with the show years ago and watched most of the seasons (i think i made it up to seasons 9 or 10). i made a very close friend here on askfm who shared my obsession with the show, and we talked regularly. after a wild course of events, that person was outed to actually be a terrible, despicable, disgusting human being and i cut them out of my life entirely. blocked them on every social media.
  
  for a long time, i couldn't watch supernatural because it reminded me of them. but now a lot of time has passed, and i've been able to watch the show again without thinking about them.

  it differs for each person, but in general, the best forms of self-care are things that make each person feel the best version of themselves. some people like to pamper themselves with things like baths, lotions, candles, etc etc., while some other forms of self care can be artistic endeavors.

  i used to be 100% in support of capital punishment when i was younger, and i held that belief for quite a few years. however, over the past maybe ... 2-3 years? ... my stance has changed, and now i disagree with capital punishment.
  
  over the course of those years, i've learned the implications of capital punishment and how not only does it mean that perfectly innocent people could be put to d*ath and exonerated after they pass, but it's also inhumane and an archaic means by which to punish someone for a crime.

   So completely ridiculous that i need to ask this. But if someone states their opinion and you tell them yours is different. Are you an asshole? Thinking differently than others isnt the same as telling them theyre wrong right? Its just. Thinking differently?
  ","
  it depends on what the opinion is. there's a major difference between people disagreeing that pineapple belongs on pizza or that women should have equal rights as men (just as examples).
  
  if someone's opinion is directly discriminating against or oppressing a group of people, such as being sexist or ableist or transphobic or homophobic, then that isn't exactly an ""opinion,"" that's bigotry.

   💡 Does a belief in free will make you more or less happy? 💡
  ","
  my happiness levels (or lack thereof) don't depend upon my belief in free will. i do believe in free will as opposed to destiny/fate, and i believe that everyone has the capability of making their own choices which can affect themselves and others in life, but it's pretty disconnected from whether or not i'm happy.
  "
379324,"
   When do you feel a teen becomes an adult?
  ","
  legally-speaking, a teenager becomes a legal adult when they turn 18 years old (at least in the united states).
  
  however, being a mature adult is a lot more complex than simply an age. i know plenty of people who are over the age of 18 and don't act like adults, they still behave like children. when a person is over 18 years old and begins to learn how to take on responsibilities, tries to be independent (as much as their mental/physical state allows), and cultivates a strong, concrete persona -- that all leads to a more ""adult"" mindset.
  "

  my best friend is one of the strongest people i know (emotionally and spiritually speaking). she's endured a lot of hardship throughout her life, and she honestly has the worst of luck especially when it comes to medical things, but she's always kept a good head on her shoulders. she's the type of person to keep moving forward despite what comes against her, and despite everything that has come in her path, she has managed to find love, get married, and is in the process of buying a house.
  
  i'm so incredibly proud of her. she's a true warrior.

Was I being unfair?
  ","
  no, you weren't being unfair at all. it's sh*tty to begin with for your friend to talk about your mutual friend behind their back to begin with, especially knowing that this mutual friend is more your friend than their friend.
  
  i think you did the right thing. nobody is obligated to like anyone else, of course, but your friend probably shouldn't have told you these things in the first place.

  no. most people with mental illness, when their illnesses are acting up, literally don't have the energy or motivation to just ""get up"" and ""get moving."" it isn't that simple, especially for people such as myself who have had chronic mental illness for years/decades.
  
  if it was that easy, then depression wouldn't be as prevalent as it is today.

   Why do people think they are always right?
  ","
  because they can't accept facts that differ from their beliefs, or they simply cannot accept opinions that differ from their own.
  "
379518,"
   More an more people on this site and social media have expressed their opinions on anon how you feel?
  ","
  i've never felt the need to express myself anonymously.
  "
379519,"
   It's your phone distracting you. Try reading instead or do something else.
  ","
  that doesn't explain the hour where i was tossing & turning without touching my phone, haha. i'll fall asleep eventually, hopefully within a reasonable time.
  "
379520,"
   How has your Sunday been?
  ","
  i'm tired but i also can't fall asleep & it's aggravating me.
  "
379521,"
   oh ok cool do u mine if we can talk more soon
  ","
  askfm is for asking & answering questions, not for talking.
  "
379522,"
   Hello how r u
  ","
  i'm all right -- just changing up some settings on my phone before bed.
  "
379523,"
   Why do i get horrible headaches and fatigue when I skip a day without coffee? could it be caffein withdrawal?
  ","
  yeah that's definitely caffeine withdrawal. i experience that whenever i don't drink coffee before like 2:00pm, haha.
  "
379524,"
   Do you play video games?
  ","
  yes, i play video games.
  "
379525,"

  it's still sunday, so nothing more besides sleep. however, tomorrow i'm working and then i have a therapy session.
  "
379527,"
   Next holiday you’re excited for?
  ","
  i don't normally get excited for holidays.
  "
379528,"
   Do you sleep in complete darkness or with a light?

   where’s your favorite place to meet new people?
  ","
  i don't like meeting new people.
  "
379531,"
   Is drama always bad? Can it ever be good?
  ","
  i've personally never really seen anything good come out of drama.
  "
379532,"
   What is more difficult for you, looking into someones eyes when you are telling someone how you feel, or looking into someones eyes when they are telling you how they feel?
  ","
  looking into someone's eyes while telling them how i feel. i have an issue with eye contact as it is, and any time i've had a serious conversation with someone regarding my feelings, i can never really look that person in the face.
  "
379533,"
   When we're you last genuinely happy and why? 🌻
  ","
  i guess the closest i've recently come to being genuinely happy was when i went camping with my friends last october. it was a fun weekend and i felt very relaxed and at peace.
  "
379534,"
   How do you think we as a society can make our communities drama free?
  ","
  i don't really think that's possible because there will always be people who thrive off of drama, whether it involves them or not.
  "
379535,"
   How can people believe in truths without evidence?
  ","
  they have faith in something despite the lack of physical or scientific proof.
  "
379536,"
   What does “drama free” mean to you? What’s your definition of it?
  ","
  drama-free means the absence of drama — such as people not caring about other people's opinions, gossiping about people to others, insulting others behind their backs, etc etc.
  "

  that rarely happens these days, rofl.
  "
379542,"
   Do you like slushees or milkshakes more?
  ","
  slushees, although i don't drink either.
  "
379543,"
   Who likes the snow? It’s pretty but I hate the cold 😂🤣
  ","
  i love the snow except for when i have to drive in it.

  ","
  no, i'm not interested in dating atm.
  "
379545,"
   Flight or cruise to any destination of your choosing. Which do you pick and where are you going?
  ","
  a flight — when i went on the cruise last year, i wasn't too thrilled with it (especially coming back to new york, we hit a storm and i felt so nauseous for like an entire day). it was definitely fun, but i think if i were to take another cruise, it would be a shorter trip.
  
  as for where i'd fly to, i'd like to visit new zealand or iceland.
  "
379546,"
   do they test you for free?
  ","
  yes, although i'm not sure if it's a universal thing.
  "
379547,"
   Doesn’t matter what your reasons are... still here. Bet you respond. I’ll respond back, and you’ll keep going. Why? It seems that people like you always need to have the last word. You’ll lose sleep if you walk away without ‘sticking it’ to me haha.
  ","
  why would i lose sleep? rofl. i'm literally sitting here answering questions & watching youtube with my roommates because i'm bored.
  "
379548,"
   Seems I’m doing well... because you’re still here engaging me haha.
  ","
  it's only been four (well, now five) questions. if i was being dead ass serious with you this whole time, that would be a different story. lmaoo.

  doubtful, although i've been thinking about getting tested again since my roommate tested negative from COVID today (just to make sure).

   What is the best TV theme song ever?
  ","
  i used to really be into the pokemon and power rangers theme songs, haha. the metalocalypse theme song is awesome too.
  "
379554,"
   Whoa! You deal in logic as a “non-binary” person? Haha.
  ","
  if this is your attempt at trolling, you're doing quite a poor job.
  "
379555,"
   What do you think of slut-shaming? Why do you think it exists?
  ","
  for some reason, people think that other people's sex lives are their business — when it isn't. to shame someone for having sex with multiple people is silly. as long as everything is consensual and between adults, there's nothing wrong with having sex.
  "
379556,"
   Did you just assume my gender, you fucking bigot?!
  ","
  that's the most logical explanation, yes.
  "
379557,"
   You leftists truly have a very distorted, childish, utopian view of reality. Obese people are a drain on resources just like whores and fags who want to chop their dicks off.
  ","
  LMAOOO.
  
  whatever helps you sleep at night, man.

   Do u sleep with a light on somewhere in your home?
  ","
  i sleep with a small light on in my bedroom.
  "
379562,"
   Do you ever air out your frustration and then instantly regret doing it?
  ","
  not lately, no. i've learned to keep most of my frustrations to myself.
  "
379563,"
   Why does it seem that most people under the age of 50 think it’s okay to be promiscuous?
  ","
  because other people's sex lives aren't anyone's business — if someone wants to sleep around, they have every freedom to do so.

   how have you been?
  ","
  my roommates just got back from urgent care & they both tested negative !! :'))
  
  however, they played a NASTY prank on me. they walked through the door with solemn faces, and i go, ""oh no ... what happened?"" they told me they both tested positive, so i panicked hardcore. i guess my roommate saw the panic in my eyes, so immediately, he goes, ""IT'S A JOKE, WE'RE BOTH NEGATIVE!"" lmaoo. as*holes.
  
  i'm laughing about it now, but omg when i tell you that my heart dropped. jesus christ.
  "
379588,"

  ","
  thank you !! i genuinely appreciate it.
  "
379589,"
   Are you calculated when you’re upset or do you react immediately?
  ","
  neither. when i'm upset, i become sorta ... numb in my feelings while also still feeling them, if that makes sense. i'm not reactive or proactive until much later. there's a significant delay between when something happens to me and when i react to it.
  "
379590,"
   Which questions do you usually delete?
  ","
  mostly trolling questions and statements that are not questions at all. i also delete s*xual questions because they're inappropriate, as well as questions where my answer is just a simple ""no"" with no other explanation.
  "
379591,"
   What's better therapy in person or through zoom?
  ","
  it depends on the individual. some people like therapy better in-person, while others prefer video appointments. obviously during COVID, most therapy sessions over the past year have been video appointments.
  
  i prefer video appointments better, simply because my therapist's office is like a 30-minute drive away and it's just easier for me to talk to her via video/phone due to my driving anxiety.
  "
379592,"
   do you typically listen to the explicit version or clean version?
  ","
  explicit, haha. i don't have children or anyone around me who's young, so i have no reason to listen to the clean versions of songs.

379593,"

   Do you think Snapchat filters are bad for your confidence? Do you they do more harm than good to your self esteem? What’s your opinion on people who always posts their pics filters that entirely changes their features?
  ","
  i think it ultimately depends on the person -- sometimes they really do affect a person's confidence levels, knowing they look more attractive using filters and if they begin to feel extra bad about how they actually look.
  
  however, i think for most people, it's just a way of expressing themselves and to have a bit of fun. for example, i know that snapchat filters thin out my face and make my facial structure more prominent (and smooths my skin, of course). i like using those filters because they do make me feel better about myself, but i'm also aware that it isn't what i *actually* look like and it doesn't affect my view of myself at all.

  lately i've been binge-watching supernatural, which has been very entertaining. i forgot how much i loved that show.

   if  someone asks u a question and u don't know the answer while u MUST know it what are u going to do?
  ","
  educate myself further on the subject if i'm interested enough in it and if i have the spare time to do so.
  "
379767,"
   Is there anything you collect?
  ","
  i have a collection of mugs and wine glasses, but i don't intentionally collect them. lol.
  "
379768,"
   It was Obama's words which incited the incident. But I don't blame him for it because I think people have personal responsibility. But you apparently don't feel that way. So you think Obama is responsible for the Ferguson incident, don't you?
  ","
  i already answered this question above.
  "
379769,"
   Why do some people claim white privilege doesn’t exist?
  ","
  because they benefit from that privilege and often claim they they themselves are ""oppressed"" because they've perhaps experienced discrimination once or twice in their lives. they're disillusioned of what oppression and privilege actually is.
  "

379772,"
   What's a terrible tv show in your opinion?
  ","
  friends. i absolutely cannot stand the show.
  "
379773,"
   Ah okay. So you think Obama was responsible for what happened in Ferguson?
  ","
  i don't remember much about obama's administration, but either way, obama wasn't making dangerous and reckless remarks on social media regarding the incident, from my understanding.
  "
379774,"
   This anon has it so wrong lol, twitter is its own organisation with its rules, if you break them they have a right to decline a user access to their service and platform, that's how it works 😂 he can spew whatever nonsense he wants, just not there anymore haha
  ","
  e x a c t l y.
  
  honestly, if he makes another twitter page, i'm going to laugh hysterically.
  "
379775,"
   Oh, you tell lies on here? Okay, well I'll just tell the truth anyway. It's against the law to ban him if they claim to be a platform. They can if they are a publisher, as there are different laws for each.
  ","
  you just sound salty that your beloved trump got banned from twitter and other social media because of his reckless and dangerous behavior.
  "
379776,"
   this anon must be a Trump supporter. lol
  ","
  oh, most definitely. lol.
  
  especially because they're claiming that trump's ""freedom"" or other people's freedoms are being stripped from them solely because social media platforms and other corporations are banning people for perfectly valid reasons. smh.

  ","
  it isn't against the law, lmaoo.
  "
379781,"
   do you not understand the difference between a publisher and a platform?
  ","
  twitter is very much a corporation in itself with its own standards, rules, and guidelines. it's. a social media platform, yes, but it isn't diminishing his ""right to free speech"" when his speech is literally encouraging violence.

379783,"
   Leftists are so blinded by their hatred for Trump that they do not understand how absolutely terrifying it is that tech companies can censor the sitting President of the United States. They will not get it until ALL of their freedoms are gone.
  ","
  it's funny how trump was all about corporate freedom until he was banned from twitter for the corporation exercising it's freedom.
  "
379784,"
   expect he’s THE president. he’s not like everyone else. twitter has been bullying him for years.
  ","
  he's the president — which means he should be more cognizant of what he posts because he has a bigger platform than pretty much everyone else who uses twitter. to take advantage of his authority to post messages that are dangerous and inciting violence is irresponsible and reckless, and also goes again twitter's guidelines.

  nope, i'm incredibly proud of twitter for finally making the executive decision to remove trump from the platform.
  
  trump is not above anyone else, and everyone on social media must follows the terms & conditions. his most recent tweets were inciting violence among his supporters, which is so dangerous. apparently his supporters are planning another storm upon the capitol on the 17th.

   Multiple months of riots and looting occurred by Antifa and BLM  and you said nothing... less than 1 day by the other side and you erupt. Both are terrible, both should not be tolerated, both should be prosecuted.. Learn to call out BOTH.... not just the other side.
  ","
  BLM protestors did nothing wrong, and those who were looting during the midst of peaceful protests are wrong — i did call that out multiple times. those looters shouldn't be associated with the BLM movement (and idk why people are against antifa, considering it's a term meaning you're against fascism).
  
  right now, i'm drawing attention to what's happening in DC because people literally stormed the capitol, putting several congresspeople's lives in danger, including pence as well. all because they can't accept the fact that trump lost the election.
  "
379928,"
   what do you want them do? shooot them?

  i don't condone violence. but the fact that officers who are there have been letting people in, taking photos with them, and generally acted ""peaceful"" means they should have behaved the same way during the BLM protests. there's no excuse.

  where are their masks, first of all? where is the tear gas? where are the bullets? why aren't these people being treated like the left was during the BLM protests in 2020?

   What villain do you believe is most worthy of a redemption arc?
  ","
  draco malfoy, by far. i don't think he was as much as a villain as he was made out to be, and i really think there's a much deeper story behind his character.

380069,"

  nothing much at all -- this upcoming week seems ordinary at best, with the exception of my two roommates who have to quarantine this week because of COVID. it should be interesting trying to work with both of them up and active around the house all week, haha.

380088,"
   I'm sorry I'm probably just stupid but does it actually track what you're doing? or could you just sign in and walk away and it's counted as active time?
  ","
  it does, including how long you're in certain programs, whether your mouse is moving or not (which sometimes makes me nervous when i'm proofreading because i'm just reading and not necessarily moving anything), what websites you visit just in case they're not related to work, etc. it's pretty involved and scared me at first, but i don't do anything unprofessional at work so i've gotten used to it.

   Has someone close ever disappointed you?

  yeah, on a few occasions.
  "
380090,"

  "
380094,"
   Is humanity progressing or deteriorating?
  ","
  both, in a weird sense. i believe we're deteriorating socially and politically, but in terms of science and technology and medicine, we're advancing rapidly.

380095,"
   i have told him that & he just says thanks i appreciate that.he is a pretty private person & hasn't mentioned his friend killing himself on his social media accounts.just to me through Facebook messenger

  "
380103,"

   When you get NEW IDEAS, what do you do so you can recall them later? Do you write them down somewhere or do you just keep them on your stuck knowledge? 🧠

  "
380107,"
   Do you like to play video games
  ","
  yes, playing video games is one of my favorite hobbies.
  "
380108,"
   How do you deal with problems and worries, do you deal with them right away or let them pile up?
  ","
  i have the unfortunate habit of pressing them down inside of me until they get too overwhelming and i tend to explode, which either comes out as a manic or a depressive episode. i deal with them in pretty unhealthy manners as well, which is something i do want to start working on more actively.
  "
380109,"
   do you feel jealous when he talks about his gf?
  ","
  not at all. i've hung out with both of them on multiple occasions.

   is your exes new gf insecure about you
  ","
  no, she understands that he and i are very close friends and she respects me.
  "
380111,"
   so does time really heal or you think what you felt for him wasn’t real love?
  ","
  it most definitely *was* real love, and the deepest love i have ever felt. despite us not being together in a romantic context, he still has a special place in my heart, which is why we agreed to continue being in each other's lives. our feelings are mutual.
  
  time heals, as well as engaging in other things that bring enjoyment in life. for me personally, i focused more on my work, on my hobbies, and on my friends.
  "

  thank you ~~

"
380115,"
   be honest do you think they way you’re dealing with your ex is healthy?
  ","
  yeah, i don't have much romantic feelings towards my ex anymore, and i value and appreciate the friendship we have fostered over the past year and change since we've broken up.
  "
380116,"
   you’re actually wrong. humans are selfish by nature. even when they are kind, they are actually selfish. they do kind things to/for others, to feel more accomplished.
  ","
  i appreciate your opinion, and we can agree to disagree.
  "
380117,"
   do you still have couple pics and sex videos with your ex or did u delete them all
  ","
  i never took any with my own phone.
  "
380118,"
   Do you struggle to write your thoughts down?
  ","
  no, writing is my easiest method by which i can organize and express my thoughts.
  "
380119,"
   Do you believe all humans are inherently selfish?
  ","
  no, i don't believe *all* humans are inherently selfish, although a good majority of them are.
  "
380120,"
   when you were with your ex, how did you feel about flirting?
  ","
  it didn't sway me either way because i was concrete in my belief that he was faithful to me. i didn't usually flirt with other people when i was in a relationship because i'm too awkward to even get to that point (even now that i'm single, i'm still too awkward to flirt).
  "
380121,"
   Do you agree with “everyone judges”?
  ","
  for the most part, yes. everyone has judged someone to a certain extent at least once in their lives, whether they realized it or not. what's more important, however, is realizing that you have judged someone based on superficial appearance or behavior and trying to correct yourself.
  "
380122,"
   Have you ever checked the phone or social network account of your partner?
  ","
  yeah, years upon years ago when i was in my early 20s.
  "
380123,"
   Is flirting cheating?
  ","
  it can be to some people, but it comes down to an individualized basis and what people will and will not tolerate. it also depends on the degree of flirting involved, whether it's something harmless with no intention or something more serious with great intention.
  "
380124,"
   What's your favorite slang word?
  ","
  ""bruh,"" rofl.
  "
380125,"
   are curious to see if the rumours are true?
  ","
  no, i couldn't care any less.
  "
380126,"
   Can you like or hate someone based on their answers, do you believe their answers are enough to show their personality?
  ","
  well, i wouldn't necessarily describe anything as ""hate"" because that's a very strong feeling that i only feel towards perhaps 1-2 individuals. but people answer questions based on what they're comfortable talking about, and while it does show one side of who they are, it doesn't encompass them completely.
  "
380127,"
   What would you say has made you the person you are today?
  ","
  a culmination of all of my experiences, whether they were personal experiences or professional experiences, and what i've learned through friendships and relationships.
  "
380128,"
   Are you always nice to strangers?
  ","
  i'm nice and respectful to strangers until they give me a reason not to be anymore.
  "
380129,"
   Do you still like ask?
  ","
  yes, i enjoy askfm. if i didn't, then i wouldn't be using it.
  "
380130,"
   Would you date someone who has a completely different taste in music and movies?
  ","
  perhaps, depending upon the chemistry we have in other areas. although music is very important to me, so it would be difficult for me to even find someone who doesn't like something that i like music-wise, haha.
  "
380131,"
   Which you prefer movies or tv shows? Do you like to watch alone or with company?
  ","
  i prefer television shows because it's easier for me to watch since i can stop after any episode and continue the next day. i like watching them alone.
  "
380132,"
   Do you like Apple phones ?
  ","
  i've never owned an apple phone before.
  "
380133,"
   What’s your opinion on people who don’t want to take the vaccine for covid, do you think they are backwards and should be forced to take it?
  ","
  i'm not sure if i agree with a mandatory vaccine at the moment, but it wouldn't surprise me if the vaccine does become mandatory in the future. as for my opinion on people who refuse to take the vaccine, i think it's irresponsible.
  "
380134,"
   Do you believe in reincarnation?
  ","
  no, not exactly, although i guess my views on what happens after death can be akin to reincarnation in a sense. basically, i believe when we die, our physical bodies perish but our souls (or spirits or whatever you believe) transfer mediums, as it's composed of energy and energy cannot be destroyed.
  "
380135,"
   What about college?
  ","
  same thing, haha. i went to college, attended my classes and often wrote my papers between classes, and then went home or went to work.
  "
380136,"
   Your favorite tv show?
  ","
  at the moment, it's supernatural.
  
  however, other favorite shows of mine include criminal minds, NCIS, how i met your mother, parks and recreation, game of thrones, house, ghost adventures, and bob's burgers.
  "
380137,"
   Why does society condone or turn a blind eye to an angry, abusive alcoholic's behavior, but we shun other addictions?
  ","
  unfortunately, alcohol use is *extremely* normalized in today's society, and a lot of people who ab*se alcohol refuse to consider themselves to be alcoholics until something really terrible happens. meanwhile, other addictions (such as to certain drugs) are shunned, like you said, because there's more of a stigma attached to them, and those addicts are often isolated and dehumanized because they have an addiction.
  "
380138,"
   Has your year gone the way you hoped? Professional? Personal?
  ","
  2020 was great for me professionally, but not so great on a personal level. i was given extra responsibilities at work and earned greater respect from higher management, which has been amazing.
  
  however, my mental health declined somewhat over the course of the year, and i started developing new symptoms that i had not experienced before.
  "
380139,"
   how’s your day going?
  ","
  my day is going well. i slept in this morning, which felt really nice. then i had some breakfast and coffee, scrolled through social media for a bit, then played video games for a few hours. it's been a day of relaxation, especially since it's been rainy and cloudy all day.
  
  right now, i'm just listening to music and answering questions.
  "
380140,"
   What do you wish for the most in the new year?
  ","
  better health, more room for self-expression, and continuing on my journey toward recovery.
  "
380141,"
   Does it annoy you when someone only hits you up when they need something?
  ","
  absolutely. that's why i don't associate with people like that anymore.
  "
380142,"
   What would you change about Askfm?
  ","
  i would improve their reporting/blocking system.
  "
380143,"
   I love your answer so much, you have a way with words 💕 I hope this doesn’t sound weird but I enjoy reading the long thoughtful answers aha.
  ","
  aw, thank you ~~

   I'm from the UK just watched a video UK UK McDonalds vs USA McDonald's a Small soda to you is a large soda to us,you're big macs and chips weigh more and have more Ingredients does that make you feel bad or nah
  ","
  it doesn't make me feel any particular way, and it doesn't surprise me either because i already knew that fast food is served at a larger, unhealthier capacity in the united states compared to other countries.
  "
380145,"
   What was your best school experience?
  ","
  i didn't really have any great experiences at school. i simply showed up, attended my classes, and went home.
  "
380146,"
   If you could meet any one celebrity, who would it be?
  ","
  chester bennington, even though he passed away almost four years ago.
  "
380147,"
   Did you meet your soulmate?
  ","
  who knows.
  "
380148,"
   you should hv gifted him a frame of u 2
  ","
  uh, no. rofl. that's extremely disrespectful to him and his relationship.
  "
380149,"
   are you a jealous person and did you manage to get rid of it?
  ","
  i've had my jealous moments in the past, but i was able to let go of them rather easily when i started to not care about the person anymore.
  "
380150,"
   Do you believe everyone has a ""soul mate""?
  ","
  yeah, although i don't believe in the conventional definition of a soul mate. i believe people can have multiple soul mates, meaning others with whom they share a close connection, and it doesn't always have to be on a romantic level.
  "
380151,"
   Do you hesitate to let people go?
  ","
  it really depends on who that person is. there are some people i can cut out of my life with no hesitation whatsoever, while there are others i cannot let go at all.
  "
380152,"
   Which is the best book you have read so far?
  ","
  ""interview with the vampire"" by anne rice. reading that book at such a formative age really helped shape my writing.
  "
380153,"
   Follow up question - given the larger platform that celebrities have, should society hold them to a higher standard of education in political matters than that to which they're currently held?
  ","
  i don't believe they should be held to a higher standard of education on a matter, but considering celebrities *do* have a larger platform than the regular civilian, i think they should really consider their opinions and how it affects others before posting their views on social networks or during interviews.
  "
380154,"
   If you could change one thing about ASKfm for 24 hours, what would it be?
  ","
  i think it would be amusing to reveal who all of the anons are for 24 hours.
  "
380155,"
   Do people have to earn your respect or do you start out respecting everyone?  If respect needs to be earned, how does someone earn your respect?
  ","
  i respect everyone until they give me a reason not to respect them anymore.
  "
380156,"
   how to get rid of my jealousy?
  ","
  do some self-thinking and discover why you feel jealousy in the first place -- perhaps it's because you may be insecure about yourself, or some other reason. once you figure out why you feel jealous of others (or a particular person), it becomes a bit easier to handle that jealousy and explain rationally to yourself how to get over it.
  "
380157,"
   Has 2020 been slow or fast for you? Did you learn anything from it?
  ","
  2020 was simultaneously fast & slow, for some reason. certain months went by incredibly fast, while other months went slowly. and it feels like last march was so long ago, but also not long ago at all.
  "
380158,"
   what’s the best compliment you’ve ever received?

  you can't exactly get rid of him because you're not the person dating him. however, if you have such a strong dislike towards your best friend's boyfriend, then you should sit down with your best friend and describe to her how he behaves and that you believe she deserves someone more mature and responsible.

  ","
  i don't have any experience with this type of situation, so i'm not really sure what a ""normal"" timeline for this would be. it depends on the seriousness of the relationship on both ends, and perhaps he's nervous. either way, you should try to talk to him about this directly if you haven't tried already.

   Where are you
  ","
  home — i was at the COVID testing site all morning just waiting, and my prospective appointment time isn't for another 1.5 hours, so i returned home in the meantime. sigh.
  "
380313,"
   I was vaping we*d pretty regularly before all of this happened so I was really scared my lungs wouldn't be able to hold up. but it seems like that's not too much of a concern I guess if that's the only like...""wrong"" thing you do. are you at the testing site now?
  ","
  i got to the testing site at 7:45am, and i just got to the front of the line to give them my name and number (it's 10:00am). they said i probably won't get a call until noon, so i'm heading home in the meantime. :/
  "
380314,"
   Did he cheat on you?
  ","
  he did once very early on in our relationship, but i forgave him then. he didn't cheat on me towards the end, and the breakup was amicable. his feelings towards me just dwindled, unfortunately, and it took me a long time to accept that and learn not to blame myself for it.
  "
380315,"
   i don’t want to butt in but i think not fighting probably caused you to drift apart.
  ","
  that thought definitely crossed my mind, tbh. we did drift apart a lot in the last few months to a year we were dating, and honestly, our connection has been a lot stronger ever since we broke up.
  "
380316,"
   ur symptoms could show up later. my boyfriend got symptoms on the 12th and then I got mine on the 14th. ofc I don't hope that for u, but I'd say that u and I are a bit similar in our lifestyles and we are about the same age so even tho everyone reacts differently I feel like we'd have the same (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... symptoms?? unless ofc you have underlying conditions or something u don't rly talk about. I only got a sore throat and lost my voice. i hope the best for u
  
  --
  
  i don't have any underlying conditions, besides the fact that i drink and vape. as of tonight, i feel okay — but also my roommate who's positive felt fine up until last night when he lost his sense of smell and taste. i'm not *overly* concerned about myself, but depending on when i was exposed if i am positive, it could possibly mean i exposed it to my family on christmas eve. but idk, that was last week and if anything, something would have probably happened by now.
  "
380317,"
   was she a complete stranger or you knew her before? i wouldn’t like living with someone i don’t know
  ","
  she's my other roommate's cousin. i had only met her previously a few times prior to her moving in, but she's a very open and friendly person.
  "
380318,"
   would you give him another chance if he broke up with his gf? can you trust him again? you seem like the forgiving type
  ","
  idk, i'm more leaning towards no at this particular moment (again, because i think he still needs to grow and not be afraid of commitment). but the future is uncertain, so who knows how i'll feel in months or years from now. he's always had a special place in my heart obviously, but right now, we're much better off as friends.
  "
380319,"
   do you fight less now? how is he better as a friend but not as a partner?
  ","
  him and i never fought really in the first place, lol. we both had our mood swings & angry moments, but we normally didn't direct them towards each other. as for why he's better as a friend right now, i don't think he was fully ready for commitment while we were dating — which is why we never moved in together or got engaged.
  "
380320,"
   is he a better as a friend or a boyfriend?
  ","
  it's difficult to say, because i guess it depends really on the timeline. at the moment, we're better off as close friends as opposed to being in a relationship, mainly because i think he's still in the process of figuring himself out — what he wants and needs, his perspectives on love, etc etc. he's been dating someone else now for a while & although they've had their fights and disagreements, this relationship seems to be teaching him a lot (at least from my outside perspective).
  "
380321,"
   Who do you admire the most right now?
  ","
  one of my roommates. she's young, but she's already one of the strongest people i know. her and i are extremely similar personality-wise (and mental illness wise, rofl) and we've gotten along brilliantly ever since she moved in.
  
  she's also endured significant trauma in her life starting from a very young age, and 2020 was absolute hell for her. i'm glad she's living with us now, it's pretty much offered her a fresh start and she seems a lot more content now compared to before she moved in with us.
  "
380322,"
   Whats your least favorite thing about Ask.fm?
  ","
  seeing my friends get harassed by anons. obviously my friends can hold their own, but some of the things said to them that i've seen are downright cruel & ridiculous.
  "
380323,"
   Would you rather be cremated or buried?
  ","
  i'd rather be cremated, or perhaps composted because it's more environmentally friendly.
  "
380324,"
   ok and what do you love about your ex, what made him special?
  ","
  i admire him for pretty much the same things — he's endured a lot of trauma and mental/physical health conditions, but despite all of that, he's a very motivated and driven person. he always puts 120% into his work. additionally, he's probably one of the most intelligent people i know.
  "
380325,"
   if you knew for certain that someone lies about their condition just to get money from others, would you expose them or would you just not care as it's not personally affecting you?
  ","
  i'd definitely say something — it's wrong and hurtful for people who actually *do* have those conditions, and that person is basically trying to profit off of sympathy when they shouldn't be sympathized with at all. it's manipulative af.

  yes, that sounds delightful.

  ","
  her inner strength even after enduring trauma and losing loved ones year after year. despite everything she's been through, she's been so successful in her personal and professional life, and i'm so proud of her for moving forward with her life — getting married, moving out of new york, and soon trying to conceive with her husband. :'))
  "
380328,"
   I’m disappointed lmaooo I thought you were a dog person
  ","
  years ago, i'd say so. but after living with two (and then four) cats for over a year, i've learned to love cats as well. they all have such unique personalities and they're the sweetest animals i've ever met.

380335,"
   aw are you sure it's gonna be hours? my site was drive thru and they had us sign in on our phones and it was about 30 minutes. are you nervous about the swab?
  ","
  yeah, they don't accept appointments and when my two roommates went this morning, they waited for like 2-3 hours. thankfully, after an hour or so, they were able to sign in and returned to the car until the could go into the facility. but they left the house around 6:00am and didn't get home until 11:00am.
  
  i'm not too worried about the swab — my roommate told me it wasn't the ridiculously long one, it's a shorter one thankfully. i was under the impression that my brain was gonna get probed, lmao.

  "
380346,"
   sorry I don’t understand. do you mean happy by over the moon?
  ","
  it's more than just happiness — it's a sense of intense euphoria, like i have 10x the amount of energy than usual, i feel i'm unstoppable, i'm hyperfixated on things, i make very rash and impulsive decisions (like binge drinking and dropping $300 on random sh*t online), and i also get irritable quickly when things don't go as planned.
  
  usually ""over the moon"" does mean happy, but i meant it in a manic sense.

  lately, i've either been really sh*tty or over the moon, and it angers me so much that i can't find a sense of stability despite taking medication to stabilize my moods. i had a major depressive episode for about three weeks in december, then was hypomanic for around 3-4 days, and now my anxiety is through the roof.

  he's okay so far -- just lost his sense of taste and smell, but no other symptoms right now. my other roommate went with him to get tested this morning, and she came up negative. i probably should have gone with them this morning, but i honestly thought he just had a cold since he's been super congested all week.

   I plan on reading it. Not because I'm religious -- I am not, I just want to read it solely for being passionate about books, esp. fantasy books. Should I give it a try?
  ","
  there's no harm in reading the bible, so i'd say go for it. i've always been interested in reading it as an adult for research reasons (there's a book i plan on writing that i intend to put biblical themes in).

   • how do you feel about buying and using secondhand items?
  ","
  i like the idea of it, although i've never gone thrifting myself or to any secondhand shops. i've bought used books, but not clothing or anything.

  probably at some point long ago when i was in religion classes as a child, but i haven't read it as an adult.

   I can't believe people in 2020 are still asking the age-old ""can something come from nothing"" question lol

380429,"
   Do you think a person can break your spirit completely?
  ","
  i'm sure it can happen to other people, but i'm not sure if a person can break my own spirit completely these days. i'm not emotionally invested in anyone right now.
  "
380430,"
   The first part is right. Science can't answer every question. And surely you will face death before even any progress in such question. I belive proper logic is the way. Can it come from nothing?
  ","
  you're better off asking a philosopher or someone even remotely interested in understanding the origin of the universe/life itself. haha.

380431,"
   How have you been? Anything new in 2021?
  ","
  well, i rang in the new year with the news that my roommate has COVID. he lost his sense of taste and smell last night, so he went to get tested this morning and the rapid test came back positive. so now we all have to quarantine for 10 days since we're all at ""high risk"" of exposure due to living in the same household. i'm getting tested tomorrow morning.
  "
380432,"
   All of that complex universe came from nothing? How do u understand all these complications?
  ","
  just because we don't understand it fully through science doesn't mean it's automatically something omniscient or higher than ourselves in a religious/spiritual sense. i believe in understanding the complexities of life and the universe through scientific evidence and research.

  ","
  i've been binge-watching supernatural lately. i'm almost done with season four (with 11 more seasons to go!).
  "
380434,"
   Is it okay to send a happy birthday text to an ex? Even if they were toxic. I just want to be kind and maybe catch up but I'm not sure.
  ","
  i think it depends on the relationship you had with them previously, as well as the friendship you may or may not have with them now. if they were toxic or ab*sive to you, then i'm leaning towards saying that you shouldn't text them -- you have to keep your own health and well being in mind, and that may open up the opportunity for them to manipulate you again.

   You ever felt envy when on social media and someone you know is doing better than you (more friends, money etc)?
  ","
  no, i'm not concerned with other people's lives, especially total strangers. i care about the lives of my friends, and if they're doing well, then i'm happy for them. if you can't celebrate your friends' successes, then you're not a true friend to them.

380441,"
   Do you think Jesus most likely never existed? Or that he existed but that his life events were greatly exaggerated or something like that? I always wonder, if it was all or some of it fake, how it became so popular (I'm still not a believer though, I have more doubts than anything about it)
  ","
  jesus was a real person, from my understanding of religion. however, i don't necessarily believe he was some sort of prophet or supernatural being that's often described in religious texts.

  "
380444,"
   Do you like the band Queen? I don't get why people like them so much and I'm suspicious that they are like the ""I have a gay friend btw"" of music bands (I mean that people only pretend to like Queen so they don't appear homophobic). Cause their music is so lame.
  ","
  i like a few of their songs, but i'm not a huge fan. i mainly like some of their music for sentimental reasons.
  
  however, just because you don't like them yourself doesn't mean other people can't like their music. everyone has a different taste in music.
  "
380445,"
   Do you believe in God? Why or why not?
  ","
  no, i don't believe in god. i've simply never believed in god even when growing up. i've always viewed the bible as a fictional storybook, in a sense.

   Hey, you ever suffered from addiction issues of any description at all? If so how, did you beat them??
  ","
  yeah, i was addicted to self-h*rm when i was a teenager. i stopped out of a promise i made to my partner at the time, and eventually i realized that there was more bad that comes out of me hurting myself than good. i still have urges to hurt myself most days, but i keep reminding myself how upset and paranoid i would become afterwards.
  
  i also quit smoking cigarettes after 10 years of smoking a pack per day. i just stopped one afternoon and started vaping a lower dose of nicotine. i still vape occasionally now, but not nearly as much as i used to.

  you're definitely not overreacting. you're rightfully under the impression that you have a monogamous relationship, and you never consented to a polyamorous relationship. he cheated on you, regardless of whether or not he has an attachment with the person he cheated on you with.

  i've never actually done this before, solely because of the fear i have of being in a dangerous situation and not having my phone in order to get help. even when i'm taking a quick five-minute trip into the drug store or 7-11, i bring my phone with me into the store.

380604,"
   If you're working, do you like or dislike your boss? — — — If you're in school, do you like or dislike your teachers?
  ","
  i've been working for the same company for over three years now, and i love my immediate supervisor. she's the best boss i've ever had, she understands my mental health conditions, she's considerate of everyone else in the department (especially everyone's worried about COVID), and she goes the extra mile to stick up for us if upper management is being irrational. i value her authority so much.

  ","
  i normally don't, haha.

380606,"

  ","
  sometimes the ""right"" job won't hire you unless you have prior experience in working a job or two. waiting for the right job may not work out in your favor for that reason, and it's important to find a job that helps you gain money and experience so you can put it on your resume/CV.
  "
380607,"
   So I saw an article where someone did a ""no spend year"" and basically didn't purchase anything that wasn't necessary for a year. If she wanted something she waited 30 days to make sure she 100% wanted it. Do you think you could do a no spend week? Month? What about a year?
  ","
  yeah, i probably could for at least a month. i don't tend to spend frivolously to begin with anyway, and the only things i ever routinely splurge on are alcoholic beverages, haha.

   Space
  ","
  i'm feeling mentally & physically crappy today, so i mustered up the energy to re-organize my desk space/at-home work station to accommodate the new movies and blu-ray disc drive i bought, and i feel a bit more at peace now. organizing things tends to help my mental health at times, i don't feel as ""crowded"" compared to the mess my desk used to be.

   Jennifer Garner gave an interview saying how shes very grateful for her privilege during pandemic, but worried abt her kids. they hv to be in online school, wear masks, worry about a scary virus. she started crying talking abt it & people trolled her? that shes rich hence should stfu. opinion?
  ","
  it doesn't matter whether or not someone is wealthy or famous during these times -- the coronavirus doesn't discriminate, which is evident by how many famous people have either fallen ill to it and have even d*ed from it. when you have children in the midst of the pandemic, that's even more cause for concern because the children also have to adjust to online schooling, which is something that can be hard for children to transition to (as well as the parents who are helping their children).
  
  it's a hard time for everyone right now. people shouldn't have trolled her. her concerns are valid.

  very much so, although sometimes my anxiety causes me to stay awake or wake up multiple times throughout the night. i've gotten into the habit of smoking a bit of weed before bed, and that seems to help a lot.
  "
380614,"
   Have you ever lied to people in order not to offend them? #WhiteLie? #Convenient
  ","
  yeah, sometimes. most of the time, however, it's pretty much to focus their attention on something other than me if they're concerned about me for whatever reason. i'll lie and say i'm okay when actually i'm not doing well at all.
  "
380615,"
   do you think that getting a bachelor’s degree is important? can you succeed in life without one?
  ","
  it can be somewhat important depending on what you want to do for a living. some jobs require a bachelor's degree or higher, such as if you wanted to work as an attorney or a nurse (but that would be a registered nursing license, sometimes a BSN).
  
  however, people have succeeded in life without obtaining a formal degree. i have plenty of friends who never finished college and they have successful careers.

  "
380617,"
   Are you a procrastinator? If so how do you deal with it?

  i'm not much of a procrastinator at all. when there's something that needs to be done, i try to do it as early as possible, otherwise i'll just get stressed out.

  ","
  veggie or carnitas burrito bowls, lamb & rice platters with white sauce, and sushi.
  "
380621,"
   How do you feel when somebody says something toxic to you?
  ","
  depends on what it is that they've said and how that person behaves normally. in most cases, that person is already a bit of a problematic person so it wouldn't surprise me, and depending on how close i am to that person, i might step forward and tell them why their toxic statement is hurtful.
  "
380622,"
   Do you believe you need money to make money?
  ","
  unfortunately, yeah. you need to invest money in order to make that money back in most cases, and very few people have that start-up money to begin with.

380632,"
   Are you more into good or bad person? What's your typical type? ❤
  ","
  i'm not a teenager anymore, so the whole ""bad boy/girl"" persona doesn't appeal to me. i would rather be with someone who's able to communicate, who's loyal, whose interests are shared with mine, and who's 100% comfortable with being themselves around me.

  ","
  that sounds like they're not such a good friend at all, and perhaps they were just saving face around you because of your boyfriend. i would advise that you talk to your boyfriend about this to get his opinion, and then eventually confront that friend about why they're acting the way they are around you when you two have been civil for the past three years.

  ","
  i would love your twitch handle !! i'm always looking to watch new streamers on twitch. :'))
  
  as for your question, i'm more content when i buy something that's inexpensive and realize that it's worth a lot (or the quality is much better than the price makes it seem to be). this happens a lot with cosmetics, i've noticed. a lot of high-end makeup is good quality, but just because something is expensive doesn't automatically mean it's a good product.

  i'm not a fan of fireworks at all, and i believe they do more harm than good. they're fun from a distance -- like if you're sitting on the beach and watching them from across the bay -- but to set them off in your own neighborhood with tons of houses surrounding you is inconsiderate.
  
  one, it startles and scares animals and people's pets. two, it can trigger people with PTSD and other people with sensory dilemmas. fireworks in themselves are also very dangerous if not handled correctly.

  i don't really think it can be easier, per say, but it really depends on the person. i'd feel much better about myself if i was 120 pounds again, haha. i've also tried to embrace being fat, but i honestly just hate myself and how i look 24/7.
