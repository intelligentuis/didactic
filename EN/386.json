myself in the mirror because i absolutely hate what i look like.\n  ","414284":"\n  yeah, mothers should absolutely be allowed to breastfeed in public. there's nothing wrong with feeding your child, and the main purpose of the breasts is to do just that.\n  \n  the only people who have an issue with breastfeeding in public are those who don't understand that concept, and they view breasts as a sexual organ more than anything else.\n  ","414285":"\n  i'm not afraid of the dark persay, but i do feel more comfortable when there's a small light on. i like being able to somewhat see in the

choice (like when i have to go to work).\n  ","414296":"\n  i don't personally believe so. just because you don't feel sexual attraction doesn't mean you're queer or part of the lgbtq+ community. it's lack of a sexual attraction, not a sexual attraction that deviates from what's been socially acceptable.\n  \n  if you want to really get into it and talk about romantic orientations, and if an ace person has romantic attractions to people that selects them for inclusion in the community, then maybe they do belong there. however, i've never given much credit to such micro-attractions because i don't personally feel like there should be a need to label *everything*.\n  ","414297":"\n  i think it still has a use, yeah. you can describe people's behaviors and personalities without applying mental illness to the equation. behavioral psychology is really just the study of why people behave the way they do, what factors in their environments and genetics influences that, and what we can do to cope with or reverse behaviors. sometimes it has nothing to do with mental illness, and we need both behavioral and clinical psychologists to differentiate the difference.\n  ","414298":"\n  i

like all other forms of linguistics, definitions change as society changes. language is constantly evolving, so we have to change our definitions of things as society evolves.\n  \n  from my understanding of it, racism refers to the systemic oppression of races -- which doesn't include white folk, because in most cases of history, white people were the ones who were performing the oppressing, not being oppressed themselves. that's why racism refers to the oppression of races other than white. obviously white people still face discrimination, but those are isolated incidents compared to the grand scheme of things.\n  ","414302":"\n  no, but calling someone i know a \"shemale\" and saying she fcks dogs is probably some of the most insensitive sht i've seen. you can kindly

it's not a *good* raise, it's still a raise & it's more than what you would be making had you never asked beforehand.\n  ","414309":"\n  doesn't matter if it's retail or not -- more responsibility equals more pay. this happened to me a lot with my last office job, they even gave me the title of \"senior writer\" without even hinting towards a raise. and i didn't say anything because i was

been the past few nights.\n  ","414316":"\n  uh, i assume you meant *something,* not someone, LOL.\n  \n  but i've been in that position many times before at previous jobs. if they're giving you more responsibility, then ideally, they should be evaluating you for a raise in pay. ask your immediate supervisor what you should do in order to be set up for a formal evaluation, because you really should be paid more if they're giving you more work to do on top of the work you already do.\n  ","414317":"\n  i live in new york, but uh, my best friend lives further north than i do, lol. i'm fairly certain it's colder in the midwest than it is in new england rn.\n  ","414318":"\n  i've never traveled anywhere specifically, so i don't know where i would want to live for two years of my

convention and it was fantastic.\n  ","414319":"\n  uh, hard drugs. lmao.\n  \n  i had my fun when i was much younger, but i'm not into the lifestyle anymore and i have no desire to get as fcked up

own individual bias, since no news media is unbiased, but that's why i read things from multiple sources instead of going to just one website.\n  ","414323":"\n  i view articles from my google news

my sandwiches, lol. whenever i go to subway, for example, i usually order italian her & cheese bread with bacon, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and avocado spread (if they have it available). if they don't have avocado, then i usually ask them to put a small amount of ranch dressing on the sandwich.\n  ","414329":"\n  it depends entirely on my mood & how i'm feeling that day. sometimes, it's easy for me to accept the past, while other times, i have no control over those feelings and i find myself in a constant state of reflection. those are the times that my depression gets worse, because i often get

with whether or not they're open to the child exploring other tastes if they express the desire to do so, how strict they are with food intake, etc etc. that changes whether or not it can be a positive or a negative thing.\n  \n  i think it can be positive if parents are open-minded and are willing to allow their child to explore meat and dairy options if they want to down the time, as long

human. i was a hollow shell of an individual. however, i've been on medication for 2+ years at this point, and my motivation is at its highest its ever been and i can actually live my life.\n  ","414418":"\n  no, i absolutely hate the summer. i prefer cold weather over warm weather. it gets too hot and humid where i live.\n  ","414419":"\n  lately i've been sleeping on my back with my head propped up, otherwise i drown in mucus.\n  \n  but otherwise, i like sleeping on my stomach with one arm under my pillow, one arm extended outward, one leg extended, and one leg bent halfway.\n  ","414420":"\n  i seldom lose my temper, thankfully. the last time i got angry was last week, but i didn't lose my temper. instead, i walked away from the situation so that i didn't aggravate it more.\n  ","414421":"\n  thankfully, i've never had any major cooking failures. every time i have made a dish, even though it's a bit rare, it came out fine (normally pasta, breaded chicken, etc etc).\n  \n  however, i absolutely cannot learn how to microwave popcorn perfectly to where it's not burnt and where there aren't many kernels leftover. i end up wanting the most out of the bag, so i put it in longer than what it says, and it burns. lmao.\n  ","414422":"\n  it's currently 40 degrees fahrenheit, and it's cloudy and gray. it's supposed to rain later tonight.\n  \n  i prefer cold weather over hot weather, definitely. i would rather be chilly than sweating, and it's so much cozier to bundle up as opposed to wear nearly nothing to withstand the heat.\n  ","414423":"\n  obviously people who are manipulative are terrible people, especially if they're purposely trying to alter someone's perspective or behavior to benefit their own good. it's selfish and demeaning.\n  ","414424":"\n  lol, not usually. i only get enraged when i'm driving behind slow cars. i can understand people walking slow if they  have a disability or injury, so it doesn't usually bother me. i just try to get in front of them as quickly as possible.\n  ","414425":"\n  yeah, i totally agree with you. plus, i recall in the books that their relationship went into *much* more detail, and it was sorta glanced over briefly in the movies and that was all.\n  ","414426":"\n  it could be better. i woke up at 5:30am because i couldn't breathe & i couldn't go back to sleep. i dragged myself out of the house to go to work, but i became so sick over the course of the morning that i ended up leaving work early.\n  \n  i'm home now and i'm drinking tea in an attempt to feel better. i'm going to take some aspirin to make my fever go down. i hate feeling sick, because mentally, i'm motivated and want to get things done, but my body won't cooperate.\n  ","414427":"\n  i'm sure you already got this answer multiple times, but the first character that comes to mind is hermione granger from the harry potter series. in the books, she's described as a generally unattractive, mousy girl with kinky brown hair, and the series is focused on her intelligence as opposed to her looks. there's one point where she transforms so much during a formal occasion that the entire rest of the characters are shocked that it's her.\n  \n  in the movies, they cast a very pretty young girl (emma watson) who grew up to be an attractive woman, which sorta offset the character development in a way.\n  ","414428":"\n  i've only ever gotten a nosebleed perhaps 3-4 times throughout my life. if it's happening routinely, though, i would seek medical attention.\n  ","414429":"\n  most anon questions are trollish or hateful, and i don't think people should be awarded coins for that nonsense. the coins are to encourage people to send out interesting questions off anon.\n  ","414430":"\n  usually small, insignificant things. songs that aren't inherently sad, that's the main one for me lately. it also depends on whether or not i've been compliant with my mood stabilizers, because otherwise i'll start crying for no reason at all.\n  ","414431":"\n  it wouldn't bother me. if i know that i'm good at a game, then it doesn't matter what other people think. you have to let things roll off your back sometimes.\n  ","414432":"\n  yes, absolutely. your safety is much more important than you attempting to show up to work in hazardous conditions.\n  ","414433":"\n  is this supposed to be in reference to something, or are you talking about manipulative people in general ??\n  ","414434":"\n  it can, but it isn't recommended. i don't have 4-wheel drive.\n  ","414435":"\n  people seem to think that

what the silliest question was, but i do remember a lot of customers getting irrationally angry over the fact that we didn't take expired coupons or coupons that weren't for the items they purchased. some people even told us they left the coupons at home, but still wanted us to apply them anyway. it was ridiculous.\n  ","414440":"\n  a criminal who blends in with everyone else is scarier, in my opinion. they're usually calm, collected, and intelligent. you can't imagine them committing the crimes they've committed, but they have that beast within them locked behind closed doors and can release it whenever they feel like it.\n  ","414441":"\n  my boyfriend and i took a small weekend vacation to the northern fork of long island last month with his family. we didn't do anything special, just went bowling and then hung out in the hotel room. then the next day we went to a brewery.\n  ","414442":"\n  cockroaches are the only bugs that bother me, surprisingly. i think it's because i had to deal with them a lot whenever i visited someone's house, though. it always grossed me out.\n  ","414443":"\n  i like my boyfriend.\n  ","414444":"\n  in general, i don't usually care about what tattoos people get as long as it makes them happy. however, face tattoos are a really risky move for obvious reasons and the only redeeming factors are if the tattoos are done well.\n  \n  that being said, the tattoo honestly looks horrible. she could have gotten a better artist to do a realism portrait instead of something that looks like an amateur unfinished sketch.\n  ","414445":"\n

another great point. the amount of times i've blacked out is terrible, and it's scary that you don't remember what you said or did.\n  ","414452":"\n  sounds like the show cops in the united states, LOL. it's ridiculous.\n  \n  the main issue i have with binge drinking and the culture surrounding alcohol in general is that it gives off the impression that drinking in excess on a regular basis is somehow normal and safe. it isn't glamorous to drink every night, especially considering most people don't know how to only stick to one drink. it's caused a lot of confusion with my own alcohol consumption because for a long time, i thought my consumption wasn't an issue. it wasn't until i started drinking in excess 3-4 times per week that i realized it was problematic.\n  ","414453":"\n  ah, that makes sense !! yeah, binge drinking is seen as the norm in the united states, which is absolutely terrible.\n  ","414454":"\n  for the most part. sometimes my anxiety gets in the way of that, though.\n  ","414455":"\n  backstabbing me by talking sh*t about me to someone else while lying to my face and pretending to be nice. i could never tolerate that.\n  ","414456":"\n  i always liked the name louis for some reason.\n  ","414457":"\n  i somewhat agree, but i also disagree at the same time -- if that makes sense. i think anything that's militant is generally bad because it's extremism, and most people who are militant wind up being extremely ignorant, close-minded, and unwilling to accept viewpoints that are contrary to their own.\n  \n  that being said, i also believe that antifascism is obviously better than fascism. i don't really know what a militant antifascist would look like because all you're really advocating for is the disassembling of a government which reigns supreme.\n  ","414458":"\n  i disagree with the statement. on a metaphorical level, it can refer to the idea that people who are cautious to trust others are only closed off to people who are honest or willing to help them. however, coming from personal experience, it's somewhat of a good thing to be hesitant to trust people because you simply do not know their intentions. there are honest people out there, sure, but there are also others who only wish to harm you. the honest people will understand your need for privacy.\n  ","414459":"\n  i prefer chips, especially sour cream & cheddar chips !! i also like dipping lays potato chips into french onion dip.\n  ","414460":"\n  strangely enough, the show \"you\" moved me and made me critically think about a lot of different things. i was also inspired by beck's passion for writing and she definitely encapsulated the feelings of being a writer who wants to pursue their passion but also feels the need to gain new experiences in order to write something.\n  \n  the show inspired me to write my own short story, which i recently published on medium.com. granted, it's a bit dark (but not as dark as the show, haha), but the overall tone of the show was influential to me.\n  ","414461":"\n  LOL. that's too funny.\n  \n  i don't see anything wrong with eating food that's more geared toward younger audiences, like spaghetti-os or sugary cereal. hell, my favorite cereal is captain crunch and i eat it every so often still, lol.\n  ","414462":"\n  my relationship has certainly been interesting because we've been together for 10 years. when we were both 17\/18 years old, we needed something completely different out of our relationship than what we need now. back then, we needed someone who was fun, spontaneous to the point of impulsivity, full of passion, and always willing to take on a challenge, no matter how risky it would be.\n  \n  since we've matured, our needs have also matured and what we used to need eventually disappeared and re-appeared as newer, more responsible necessities. emotional maturity, loyalty, a willingness to work hard to earn a living, diligence, responsibility, and holding the idea that we must move on from our past to pursue a better future.\n  ","414463":"\n  red is the warmest color to me because i associate it with my boyfriend the most out of any color. although red can represent wrath in some cases, it also represents compassion, love, passion, empathy, comfort, etc etc. he personified all of those ideals.\n  ","414464":"\n  ugh, yeah -- i agree with that opinion. it's disgusting how middle aged people will find it somehow okay to maintain an interest in people who are either underage or just barely adults. even though it's legally okay once they turn 18, it's still a red flag for abvse.\n  \n  most people who are much older than their partners like that (i'm talking about people who are under 20 dating people 35+) are dating them for the power play and the fact that they can easily take advantage of them.\n  ","414465":"\n  that's interesting -- i never knew that before. i don't really see the reason why there's such a split because they all get you drunk either way, but i'm also basing this off of the american idolization\/normalization of alcohol abvse since it's all i've ever known. i'm sure alcohol consumption isn't glamorized as much in other countries as it is in the united states.\n  ","414466":"\n  yeah, that used to happen to me a lot when i used to frequently ask questions here. i ended up writing them down in the notes section of my phone so i could remember when i had the spare time to ask them.\n  ","414467":"\n  like -- the versatility of the landscape, how i can go from beautiful woods and isolation to urban cities in just an hour or so. i like the vineyards of long island and everything in montauk as well.\n  \n  dislike -- the high prices of everything, including rent and mortgages and whatnot. taxes are incredibly high too. people don't get paid enough to sustain a life here.\n  ","414468":"\n  a spa retreat with her friends !!\n  ","414469":"\n  thank you !! i'll definitely have to take a trip down just to see, my boyfriend and i were talking about it yesterday actually.\n  ","414470":"\n  i'm debating on either new england, like vermont or massachusetts, or somewhere down south like north carolina or virginia.\n  ","414471":"\n  i like the name leigh, yeah.\n  ","414472":"\n  i don't really have any advice because freelancing sort of fell into my lap, i didn't actively seek it out.\n

sh*tty. i've been sick all day so it was hard to get through work. i'm looking forward to sleeping tonight.\n  ","414476":"\n  obviously not, lol.\n  ","414477":"\n  thank you so much. \u2661 it's

dancing, so none.\n  ","414479":"\n  i walked two miles on the treadmill and worked out my arms and legs afterwards, rotating my arms and my legs every other time i went.\n  ","414480":"\n  i went to

i've been exhausted by the time i get home from work these days.\n  ","414486":"\n  i drive a hyundai.\n  ","414487":"\n  i only check my phone for notifications when i receive them, so it depends on how active my social media accounts are that day. when it comes to askfm, i only check it when i get multiple questions in a row or when i'm simply bored by the end of the day.\n  ","414488":"\n  i

boyfriend got a tattoo today & i'm so proud of him because it's in recognition of his sobriety, and i feel like addicts don't truly receive the recognition they deserve for remaining sober despite the culture that exists today that basically celebrates and down-sizes substance & drug abvse.\n  \n  idk i'm just so proud of him. he's been through so much & i'm happy that he's celebrating his sobriety and recognizes that strength within him.\n  ","414497":"\n  i don't really use wifi anywhere except my house and my boyfriend's house.\n  ","414498":"\n  you have to remember that people only post

their posts from the timeline.\n  ","414499":"\n  zero. i already get enough notifications as it is, i don't want to add any more. if i'm interested in catching up on someone's answers, then i'll just visit their page.\n  ","414500":"\n  yeah, i wholeheartedly believe that people should have to retake their driving tests every 10-15 years or so. the elderly get into so many accidents because their senses are deteriorating, and it simply isn't safe.\n  ","414501":"\n  i finally succumbed. i finally have fallen sick in light of the rest of my office fighting sickness. i can't breathe or regulate

bugs have to do with being 27 years old ??\n  ","414506":"\n  damn, y'all are making me feel old, LOL. i know i look young, but being 27 isn't exactly an old age either.\n  ","414507":"\n  warm

","414509":"\n  uh, you're still a minor if you're under the age of 18. considering i'm a full grown adult, i wouldn't want children reading content regarding sxx on my page. it's also against the

to obsess over or judge names. the only time names concern me are when i'm picking out names for characters in a story i'm writing.\n  ","414512":"\n  my weekend has been all right. yesterday, i worked on some freelance writing and did 3 loads of laundry and cleaned. i also got drunk by the end of the night, lol.\n  \n  this morning, i woke up around 6:30am for some reason, but noticed that my boyfriend was awake because he couldn't sleep all night. so i went over his house and spent time with him before he went into work this afternoon. since coming back home, i've just been scrolling through social media and drinking coffee, and i also spent about 45 minutes cleaning the house.\n  ","414513":"\n  depends on what the subject matter is, haha. you're free to ask me any question,

never traveled to a different country before, so it would be a big leap to suddenly move somewhere i've never been to before.\n  ","414524":"\n  no, i plan on moving out of state when i get an opportunity to do so. i was leaning more toward the southern united states, but now i'm unsure as to whether i still want to do that or go somewhere more north in new england.\n  ","414525":"\n  it

indicates, i live in new york.\n  ","414534":"\n  i don't see why it wouldn't be okay. however, you do have to be cautious regarding people on social media because you're not 100 percent certain that they are who they say they are. don't trust them immediately and, instead, develop an understanding of them through regular discussions before investing your emotions into them.\n  ","414535":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","414536":"\n  i'd rather go the extra mile for someone or something to prove my compassion rather than sit back and assume that they're aware of my feelings and commitment. you should never stop trying to show your love for whatever you love in your life.\n  ","414537":"\n  this is an incredibly vague message, so i don't really have a concise idea as to how to help you. if you did something wrong that put a bad spotlight on you, the best thing you can do is own up to your mistake and vow to never do it again, as well as take the appropriate actions to right that mistake to the best of your ability.\n  \n  management likes seeing people take responsibility for their actions, it shows commitment as well as maturity. in some cases, they might not care but it's better to err on the safe side rather than do nothing about it.\n  ","414538":"\n  to be fair, i'm moody 24\/7 regardless of how much i sleep, LOL. my mood stabilizers have fixed it for the most part, but i do experience some mood swings here and there depending on what i'm going through.\n  ","414539":"\n  cleaning up poop or other messes they've made, especially if it's somewhere in the house. however, i never saw that as a big deal because that's the responsibility you take on when you decide to adopt an animal, and it's 100 percent worth it.\n  ","414540":"\n  yes !! lol, every time i have an exciting event coming up, i always note how far away the event is because it makes me more excited. i always thrive when i have things to look forward to.\n  ","414541":"\n  i have the capacity to be fairly patient, yes. people have told me in the past that i'm perhaps *too* patient, but i do believe that good things come to those who wait while putting the time and effort into reaching those goals.\n  ","414542":"\n  life isn't complete without experiencing it with someone you love by your side, whether that's a partner or close friend or family member. we're all in need of a support system.\n  ","414543":"\n  i left my boyfriend's house this afternoon because he had to go to work, and as i was pulling out of the starbucks drive-thru, i see him slowly driving down the road i was turning onto & we stared at each other for a solid 30 seconds. lmaooo.\n  \n  i ended up texting him when i got home like, \"THAT WAS DEFINITELY YOU RIGHT.\" and he went, \"lmao yes. yes, it was.\"\n  ","414544":"\n  i don't like sports at all, but i watch ice hockey from time to time. i suppose my favorite athlete would be henrik lundqvist.\n  ","414545":"\n  no, i disagree. BPD is a highly misunderstood disorder, and personally, my intense emotions have always made life even more difficult to deal with, and i wish i didn't experience these feelings as intensely as i do. even small, insignificant things affect my mental state and it's always exhausting. even though i'm in treatment, i still have relapses in my thought patterns and i still struggle with self destructive behavior, and i wouldn't wish BPD on anyone.\n  ","414546":"\n  i can't think of any games at the moment, actually. obviously there's the elder scrolls VI, but no one has any idea when that's going to be released.\n  ","414547":"\n  depends on what kind of rum you buy, there are all different types and flavors. i like dark rum (kraken) and malibu (coconut rum).\n  ","414548":"\n  yes, i can. i've been using a computer regularly since i was a child, so i've learned how to type efficiently.\n  ","414549":"\n  lust is a physical attraction you have towards someone upon meeting them. lust is superficial and is expressed through carnal desires.\n  \n  love, on the other hand, runs much deeper than lust. love is when you know of a person's flaws and still cherish their existence in your life. love is being able to say that you would take a bullet for someone if it meant saving their life. love is believing in the best in a person and helping them work towards becoming the best version of themselves they can be.\n  ","414550":"\n  i'd like to believe i am, yes. i don't speak of other people's issues that they've told me in confidence and i always try to be available to my friends if they need my help.\n  ","414551":"\n  i prefer dramas, suspense, thrillers, etc etc. my favorite writers are stephen king, anne rice, george orwell, franz kafka, pablo

received were from mental health professionals.\n  ","414564":"\n  if you think you have bpd, then you should see a psychologist or a therapist. that's one of the few ways you can diagnose the

for himself. i just found out he's been backstabbing my boyfriend & spreading his business without his consent, and that's not okay at all. not to mention the fact that he owed me money in the past and still tries to pull fast ones on me despite the fact that i gave him the benefit of the doubt and forgave him the first time.\n  \n  i'm tired of it, and he's also screwed over my boyfriend too many times to count. i'm not going to sit here and continue to be friends with him when he's hurt my boyfriend so much. he never learns his lesson & every time he says he'll change, he goes back to his old ways. there's only so much we can take.\n  \n  i think this is the right decision to make. i've known him for 10 years and its a difficult decision but there's no use in holding onto a person

linked to bad or violent behavior, such as violent video games, BDSM, metal music or having body modifications. in that, they don't directly cause bad behavior and they're not going to turn a person from a law-abiding citizen into a criminal.\n  \n  however, i do believe that people who are inherently bad or violent do have a tendency to lean towards violence in the media because it can be seen as an outlet for their aggression. they often fantasize about violence and the media is the only socially acceptable way for them to maintain their interests without them going out and doing those behaviors themselves.\n  ","414647":"\n  i do believe casey anthony was guilty for k*lling her daughter, yes. i mean, just like my answer to the last question, i don't remember the specifics of the

wronged you multiple times & distance yourself from them immediately. when provided with an opportunity to prove yourself in order to progress, take that without hesitation. only surround yourself

in the whole stereotypical gray aliens idea with big heads and long fingers, etc etc.\n  ","414661":"\n  i never dissected anything in high school, but upon taking an anatomy and physiology class in college, we dissected a cow's eyeball. this was during my sophomore year in college.\n  ","414662":"\n  i figured that was coming next.\n  ","414663":"\n  this is entirely true, unfortunately. however, i was mainly referring to the people who misinterpret the bill and think that people can obtain an abortion up until birth regardless of reasoning, which is obviously completely false.\n  ","414664":"\n  i would inform them that they're not alone in their thoughts & plenty of people don't think highly of themselves either in terms of physical attraction. however, that sort of validation must come from within, so in time, they'll learn how to appreciate who they are and find the beauty within themselves.\n  ","414665":"\n  well, today has been developing into a good day so far. even though i've only been awake for an hour, lol. i left my boyfriend's house, picked up coffee on the way home, and now i'm going to start working on some freelance writing for extra money.\n

else.\n  ","414667":"\n  no, i don't. to be fair, however, i never looked for their advice or guidance in the first place, even when i was a teenager.\n  ","414668":"\n  honestly, all of the anti-abortion rhetoric that's occurring lately since new york passed that abortion bill has been so stupid. most of the people who spew ignorant comments about the bill probably didn't even read the bill itself or develop a full understanding of what the bill is actually about, so they're basing their opinion off of false information.\n  ","414669":"\n  i'm a good person at heart, but i'm also willing to cut corners and do questionable things for the people i love.\n  ","414670":"\n  i suppose so ?? i haven't felt the need to label myself as such since i was in early high school, lol.\n  ","414671":"\n  uh, i assume you mean how long have i been playing video games ?? if so, then i've been playing video games since i was a child.\n  ","414672":"\n  sometimes, but not usually. i value my alone time and i prefer to be alone in most cases, with the exception of the time i spend with my boyfriend.\n  ","414673":"\n  presumably my boyfriend, but we don't have the opportunity to go out on dates very often. we usually prefer to stay home, snuggle up with blankets, and watch television or youtube.\n  ","414674":"\n  coffee -- iced coffee, hot coffee, black coffee, coffee with cream, coffee with flavors, etc etc. i'm a big fan of coffee.\n  ","414675":"\n  thank you, i appreciate it ~~\n  ","414676":"\n  if it does then i'm unaware of it.\n  ","414677":"\n  no, it's too cold to wear them around the waist.\n  ","414678":"\n  that's what it sounds like, for the most part. it isn't so much rage as it is deflection.\n  ","414679":"\n  LOL. strangely enough, i've never heard that one before.\n  ","414680":"\n  lol it isn't basic american food. i never saw the appeal in it.\n  ","414681":"\n  that's probably a large part of it too, yeah.\n  ","414682":"\n  i don't have any pets.\n  ","414683":"\n  i'm watching daredevil with my boyfriend.\n  ","414684":"\n  you're probably better off asking someone who is beautiful.\n  ","414685":"\n  i pretty much had to get the tip of my ring finger stitched back on because my hand got slammed inside of a door when i was a child and severed it pretty badly.\n  ","414686":"\n  i don't have any thoughts on the matter. i understand that the p*rnography industry is extremely problematic and detrimental, but i don't have any thoughts on people who watch p*rn. it doesn't affect me.\n  ","414687":"\n  bearded dragons !! they're so adorable, aw.\n  ","414688":"\n  we live somewhat near one another, but not really. long island is pretty big.\n  ","414689":"\n  that's too funny. i guess that's the same reason why a lot of people not native to new york are curious about hicksville, since that's where billy joel grew up.\n  ","414690":"\n  i have, but i've never mentioned it to their face.\n  ","414691":"\n  this defines my entire childhood and partially my adulthood, sadly enough. my mother enjoys focusing on really small, insignificant things and blowing them out of proportion, where she makes herself out to be the victim even if something has nothing to do with her in the first place.\n  ","414692":"\n  LOL. there's literally nothing in massapequa. there's a huge mall, but that's literally the only thing going for the town.\n  ","414693":"\n  no, apparently the weather is going to be mild & slightly warmer than usual next week. the lowest temperature i can see is 24 degrees fahrenheit on thursday, but the rest of the week is within the 30s and 40s.\n  ","414694":"\n  long island is comprised of mostly major highways and parkways, lol. you're always within a 5 minute drive from some sort of major road.\n  ","414695":"\n  i'd like to believe that i have a firmer grasp on the english language and grammar than most other people, considering i have a degree in the subject and it's something i practice at work every day.\n  ","414696":"\n  i think it depends on the individual, as well as what hurt them in the first place. i believe time heals most wounds, especially with respect to breakups and whatnot, but when it comes to more serious matters (i.e. the passing of a loved one), it doesn't matter how much time has passed because the wound will still be slightly opened.\n  ","414697":"\n  i personally know quite a few people my age (between 21-29) who don't believe feminism is necessary in modern times. i've never discussed it with them personally, but i see them occasionally posting articles on facebook about it.\n  ","414698":"\n  considering over the past few weeks, i've been writing a story about the personification of death ... nothing good is rattling around my head rn.\n  ","414699":"\n  sounds like a cultural discrepancy. that's really interesting, though.\n  ","414700":"\n  yes, i definitely believe so. my boyfriend is too harsh with himself and he's never convinced that he's doing well enough or doing something just right. he's always looking more deeply into the way things work and trying to fix something further, and he's also never satisfied with his own work.\n  ","414701":"\n  idk where you're getting that impression from, but most women i've interacted with are supporters of feminism. if they don't support feminism, it's because they don't support the white, \"trendy\" interpretation of 21st century feminism that's rampant today.\n  ","414702":"\n  for me personally, one of the worst feelings is when you experience that empty, hollow, dropping feeling in the pit of your stomach when you find out something that hurts you through to your very core.\n  \n  even thinking about the feeling makes me feel uncomfortable. it just reminds me of all of the moments where i had that feeling and what was occurring at the time.\n  ","414703":"\n  yes, sometimes my self esteem issues affect my relationship because it makes me question his love and commitment to me, due to the fact that i don't believe that i'm a very lovable or attractive person.\n  ","414704":"\n  the necklaces my boyfriend has bought for me over the years and all of the handwritten letters he's given to me alongside those necklaces. they're incredibly sentimental to me.\n  ","414705":"\n  aw, thank you. that's sweet ~~\n  \n  i'm doing fine -- just exhausted, so i'm inhaling a cup of iced coffee in the hopes that it wakes me up enough for me to drive to my boyfriend's house tonight.\n  ","414706":"\n  my boyfriend (if he counts), coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, and

feeling this way. i assume you meant that it *wasn't* going to work. however, any breakup hurts both people involved, but eventually the pain does get easier to cope with as long as you have support.\n  \n  if you need to cry, then cry -- there's nothing wrong with it. crying releases endorphins which makes you feel better.\n  ","414761":"\n  telling you that they'll make it up to you is somewhat an apology. however, i don't know the situation because i don't know who you or your friend are, so i can only base my answers off of what you've given me.\n  \n  regardless, i believe it's

of my friends plays it all the time.\n  ","414794":"\n  i think it depends on the individual. ironically, i recently had another anon post in my inbox about how they feel terrible about their physical appearance and prefer how they look through snapchat.\n  \n  i do have to admit, most of my selfies are taken through snapchat because it clears up my skin and thins out my face. however, i already have low self esteem to begin with, so idk if it really has an effect on it at all.\n  ","414795":"\n  yeah, i agree. i'm just happy for the moment that i can still file my taxes.\n  ","414796":"\n

","414799":"\n  it depends on what i *need* to get done versus what i *want* to get done, if i have anything to do that day to begin with.\n  \n  on a regular day where i feel motivated, i'll usually do laundry and clean. i also run errands sometimes early in the morning if i need to pick anything up from the store. however, if i'm exhausted or not feeling up to anything, then i usually just stay home and catch up on sleep.\n  ","414800":"\n  monday when i went over my boyfriend's house.\n  ","414801":"\n  i usually like dark roasts. i get the french roast at starbucks & the brazilian roast at

know, the new abortion law in new york state says that people can have an abortion after 24 weeks if the mother's health is at mortal risk.\n  \n  i 100 percent support the new law. doctors have been persecuted in the past for saving people's lives by aborting after 24 weeks, and this law ensures that the mother's well being and safety is taken seriously.\n  ","414806":"\n  it's normally fairly windy where i live as it is, and the wind factor around my office building is absolutely ridiculous.\n  \n  there's really no way to avoid the wind, so i usually just endure it.\n  ","414807":"\n  it's normally gray and very windy, and occasionally we get snowstorms where we get anywhere between 3-24 inches of snow, depending on how severe the storm is.\n  ","414808":"\n  they absolutely terrify me because i'm always forced to drive in icy weather. this past monday was really icy, it dropped down to 8 degrees fahrenheit during the day, which made for slippery roads because it had rained the previous day.\n  ","414809":"\n  around 4:45-5:00pm these days. i can't wait until the spring, when i can actually drive home from work in daylight instead of pitch darkness.\n  ","414810":"\n  my wednesday wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't great either. i couldn't get out of bed on time this morning, but i still ended up arriving to work before 9am, which was a relief.\n  \n  work dragged, but i had a good lunch with my coworkers, which broke the day up nicely. i've only been home for about an hour, and i'm planning on doing absolutely nothing tonight.\n  ","414811":"\n  yes, i wish i had a more defined jawline, since i absolutely hate how i look when you view me from the side. i wish i was skinnier as well.\n  ","414812":"\n  to improve my hygiene, perhaps i could brush my teeth twice per day instead of once per day and floss more often. other than that, my hygiene is pretty well-managed. i'm so paranoid about looking dirty or smelling bad, so i always make sure that my hair looks clean and that i have some sort of pleasant scent on.\n  ","414813":"\n  it's difficult for me to describe the taste of food, especially verbally as i've always had a hard time expressing my thoughts and feelings verbally.\n  \n  i'm not really all that interested in food to begin with, so it also has never been something that has occurred to me.\n  ","414814":"\n  january has flown by, honestly. i don't recall much of what i've done in january at all -- all i've been doing is working, and occasionally seeing a friend or two and my boyfriend on a regular basis.\n  \n  however, this past monday was a wonderful day & it was the most fun i've had in a really long time. my boyfriend and his friends and i all got together, and we ended up playing video games and poker together until 2am.\n  ","414815":"\n  my hobbies include writing, reading, browsing the internet (lol), playing video games, watching television shows & documentaries, hanging out with friends, and painting.\n  \n  i don't know if these hobbies make me who i am, although they are a large part of who i am. and it's easier for me to identify with material objects and interests as opposed to ideas and personality traits.\n  ","414816":"\n  LOL.\n  \n  the last time i isolated myself was tonight, actually. i'm currently shut away in my room, drinking coffee and listening to music and drowning out the sounds of my household. i don't want to bother with anyone, i just want to be left alone in the quietness.\n  ","414817":"\n  i certainly hope not. i'm not quite as adventurous as i used to be, but i still have a passion for seeking new experiences as they help me learn and evolve as a human.\n  ","414818":"\n  i'm hard on myself because i know i can do better than how i'm currently doing. i can work harder than how i'm currently working. i can put more effort into my appearance, i can take more time looking after my health, and i can be more productive if i sacrificed a few things in my life.\n  \n  i'm hard on myself because i deserve to be hard on myself, because you cannot improve without looking at yourself critically.\n  ","414819":"\n  i believe it would help me eat healthier food, and i rarely eat meat products to begin with as it is. i already transitioned to black bean & veggie burgers instead of beef burgers.\n  ","414820":"\n  not generally, no. i have the tendency to be rather pessimistic, especially in light of terrible circumstances. i always expect the worst to happen, and when something bad does happen, i become very overwhelmed.\n  ","414821":"\n  yes, i eat meat occasionally. i'm not vegetarian or vegan, although i would like to transition to vegetarianism eventually.\n  ","414822":"\n  i surpassed my expected number of completed assignments this morning, which was a pleasant surprise and made me proud of myself. i was expecting to complete between 7-8 at the most, but i managed to write 11 narratives within four hours.\n  ","414823":"\n  i have no interest in obtaining power, and i'm not a powerful person by any means. i know how to be a leader when it's warranted, but it isn't a position i'm comfortable being in sometimes because i'm afraid of ab*sing my power & privilege.\n  ","414824":"\n  most of the time, i'm a very patient person. i'm willing to work with other people and give them the benefit of the doubt if they're learning something new or don't understand a concept or action.\n  \n  however, sometimes i can be rather impatient. it mostly happens with myself because my mind works faster than my body can handle, and often i become frustrated with myself because i'm not moving as fast or as efficiently as i want to be.\n  ","414825":"\n  i'm more honest to others than i am to myself. it's difficult for me to be honest with myself with certain subjects because the truth can be hard to swallow.\n  ","414826":"\n  i don't know about the country as a whole, but the most common complaint in my region is that rent and mortgages are extremely expensive. it's difficult for people to live independently because an average ranch-styled home is $500k on average, and rent for a one-bedroom apartment varies between $1.2k and $1.5k.\n  ","414827":"\n  i can't really make that determination at the moment because i simply don't know how puberty blockers & hormones will be 5-10 years down the line. as they are now, puberty blockers are mostly detrimental to a child's development so there is a lot of controversy regarding giving children under the age of 16-18 hormones. i would be hesitant to say yes because i don't know how it would affect their health, but obviously i would be 100 percent supportive of their need to transition.\n  ","414828":"\n  i've been given a lot more chances that i realistically shouldn't have been given in the first place. i have a tendency to screw up a lot, act selfishly, become distant, etc etc. my boyfriend knows how to call out my behavior when it warrants correction, but he has also given me a lot of second, third, and fourth chances when i really didn't deserve them.\n  ","414829":"\n  AH, YES. well -- maybe not tomorrow, but definitely over the weekend. :'))\n  ","414830":"\n  i believe it varies from relationship to relationship, since everyone has different qualities which are attractive to their partner.\n  \n  personally speaking, what has kept the spark alive in my relationship is our ability to have genuine fun together, where we can sit down and talk & joke around and laugh until tears are rolling down our faces.\n  \n  we also go out together occasionally, where we'll either go bowling or go to a brewery, etc etc. making memories and experiencing is what keeps my relationship alive, and we've become not only partners but also best friends.\n  ","414831":"\n  it depends on the lie itself, since it's difficult to give a blanket statement regarding *all* white lies since they all range in subject and severity.\n  ","414832":"\n  paul rudd, jason statham, robert downey jr., jack nicholson, tom felton, and leonardo dicaprio.\n  ","414833":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","414834":"\n  i play video games on the xbox one, and most of the games i play are first person shooters or open world RPGs.\n  \n  my favorite game atm is fallout 76, but i also love the rest of the fallout series, the elder scrolls series, the assassin's creed series, the tomb raider series, the bioshock collection, life is strange, the wolf among us, the walking dead, etc etc.\n  ","414835":"\n  ideally, i would love to create a novel or a book of short stories & poetry. it's something that has always been a goal of mine ever since i was a teenager. within the past year, i have been writing more frequently, which i believe is a step in the right direction.\n  ","414836":"\n  most recently, i was stuck in traffic. LOL. it took me nearly an hour to get home from work today.\n  \n  however, in a more metaphorical sense, i was stuck when i graduated from college & had no idea what profession i wanted to pursue. i ended up working retail for an additional year after graduating because i didn't know what sort of career i wanted, and eventually i began looking for jobs that had to do with writing and editing.\n  ","414837":"\n  you shouldn't wait to take an opportunity that may present itself in rare, or once-in-a-lifetime, occasions. our lives on this earth are short and fleeting, and we should take advantage of unique opportunities that provide growth, fun, and experience.\n  ","414838":"\n  i don't believe in heaven. however, for the sake of answering this question, i'll pretend that it exists to me.\n  \n  if i were to (somehow) go to heaven, it would probably be filled with things that bring me peace, people who enriched my life prior to their passing, and a general sense of tranquility and well being.\n  ","414839":"\n  i was stunned when i saw linkin park perform live in concert for the first time. i ended up sobbing towards the end of the show because of how moving it was. i've seen them at least 3 times in concert since then, and every show was magical, fantastic, and heartfelt.\n  ","414840":"\n  yeah, i believe that there are some people out there who are *too* friendly -- to the point where their kindness is often taken advantage of and they become hurt as a result. in some cases, people who are too friendly don't know how to say \"no,\" which results in them getting stuck in awkward situations.\n  ","414841":"\n  peppermint, lavender, sage, yellow and pink roses, and sunflowers.\n  ","414842":"\n  continue to survive when all i wanted to do was crawl into

hours.\n  ","414849":"\n  depends on what sort of liquor it is. i usually mix vodka and rum with sodas, but i drink moonshine, amaretto, and elderflower liquor on the rocks.\n  ","414850":"\n  honestly, i usually just try to sleep it off these days. when i'm sad, it normally turns into depression where i have no motivation or will to live, so i wind up sleeping all day.\n  ","414851":"\n

boyfriend keeps things in perspective for me.\n  ","414861":"\n  i've literally never said that. people have asked me if i thought others were fake if they don't post photos of themselves online, and the only specific thing i can recall saying is that perhaps they're insecure with themselves and don't feel comfortable posting photos on the internet.\n  ","414862":"\n  that's not true. no one is obligated to post photos of themselves on social media, and\n  \n   @lnr87\n  \n  isn't pretending to be someone else either. if she was fake, then she would have used someone else's photo and pretended to be that person.\n  ","414863":"\n  that isn't a question i can answer, considering i'm not\n  \n   @lnr87\n  \n  . a person isn't fake because they're uncomfortable with photos of themselves on the internet. it just means they want their identity to be kept private.\n  ","414864":"\n  right, and that doesn't make you \"fake\" at all. there are dozens of people on the internet who don't post photos of themselves, it's simply a privacy matter.\n  ","414865":"\n  lol, no. if i thought\n  \n   @lnr87\n  \n  was fake, then i wouldn't interact with her on social media.\n

night.\n  ","414880":"\n  it could be, because i feel the same way with people i'm close with. i'm incredibly clingy when it comes to my boyfriend and closest friends, to the point where i feel as if my life would be in shambles if they disappeared from it.\n  \n  there's a weird disconnect, though. usually the people i cut from my life were never that close to me to begin with, or if they were (like one or two people were), then something terrible must have happened for me to finally cut that person out of my life.\n  ","414881":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n  ","414882":"\n  i've never threatened to cause physical harm to a person, no. mainly because i'm a tiny, frail excuse for a human being and it wouldn't make sense for me to threaten someone when i wouldn't be able to follow through with it.\n  ","414883":"\n  whoops, i didn't answer this before the weekend ended, LOL. my weekend was actually good, i saw my boyfriend for three days in a row, which felt really nice because we seldom see each other anymore (perhaps only once to twice per week).\n  \n  last night, we invited a few of his friends over for games and poker, and it was the most fun i've had in a really long time.\n  ","414884":"\n  no, it's relatively easy for me to cut people from my life. if someone pushes me to the point where i'm contemplating removing them from my life entirely, then i have no feelings toward them anymore. i've removed plenty of people from my life without a second thought.\n  ","414885":"\n  i think the shutdown is pretty pointless. government employees are filing for unemployment because they don't know how long the shutdown is going to last, and it's detrimental to thousands of americans who live paycheck-to-paycheck.\n  ","414886":"\n  i always fantasize about having a day to myself where i don't have anything to do -- where i can sleep in as long as i want, drink as much coffee as i want, and not leave the house at all.\n  ","414887":"\n  i prefer leather jackets, boots, blue jeans, cowboy boots, beanies, and army print.\n  ","414888":"\n  i think it's too early to say for certain who will win the presidential race in 2020. however, as much as i dislike trump, i don't think i would be surprised if he was elected to office again. he still has some strong supporters despite the chaos that has happened in the past few years.\n  ","414889":"\n  sometimes, but it's also something that i've continuously worked on for many years. i used to hold a grudge for a long time, but i've recently learned to let things go because grudges mainly hurt you, not the other person.\n  ","414890":"\n  oh really ?? i didn't know that about her, i thought she was a woman.\n  \n  and yes, i abvsed drugs & alcohol, but i wasn't into the whole party lifestyle -- and i'm definitely not into that now, lol. even when i had my \"party\" stage (for lack of a better term), it only lasted a few years when i was 19 to 21 years old, which was a long time ago.\n  ","414891":"\n  amazon, LOL. i buy pretty much any miscellaneous thing i need from amazon because i have prime, so the two-day shipping is hard to resist.\n  ","414892":"\n  no, i don't believe courtney love had any role to play in the death of kurt cobain. i believe he completed svicide.\n  \n  when i watched the documentary \"soaked in bleach,\" however, i found the opposing viewpoints to be very interesting, though. i don't know if it's still on netflix or not, but i really enjoyed watching it because it raised a lot of questions.\n  ","414893":"\n  no, that doesn't describe me at all. i'm non-binary, and i had a pixie cut once when i was 17 years old. i'm not interested in party lifestyles, and i absolutely hate dancing. i've also never been punk before, either in personality or in clothing, and i'm not open in a sxxual manner.\n  ","414894":"\n  i don't believe that the wall should be built. the resources and funds that would go into the wall would be far better suited to fixing what's already wrong with this country or go towards helping homeless citizens, veterans, and health care.\n  \n  i also haven't read up too much on it, but apparently the wall would disrupt the environment located along the border and displace species of animals.\n  ","414895":"\n  yes, i absolutely believe that he's guilty. i haven't watched the documentary on him yet, but apparently there's very strong, compelling evidence within the documentary of him behaving this way since he was much, much younger.\n  ","414896":"\n  no, i've never compared myself to miley cyrus before (nor has anyone else).\n  ","414897":"\n  yes, i believe in extraterrestrial beings, or at least life existing in some format elsewhere in the universe. to think that the earth is the only planet that can sustain life, when we haven't discovered a fraction of the universe, is a wee bit ignorant.\n  ","414898":"\n  \"the killing\" on netflix was an absolute gem imo, if you love true crime and police dramas and whatnot. i'm not sure if it's still on netflix anymore because i watched it over a year ago, but the storytelling was compelling.\n  ","414899":"\n  i think it would be a good idea for victoria's secret to offer plus sized options. i honestly didn't even know that they *didn't* sell clothing in plus sizes, lol. i'm sure they would garner a broader audience by offering more sizes.\n  ","414900":"\n  it depends on what's bringing me down in the first place. if i'm in the midst of a depressive episode, then pretty much nothing can cheer me up and the only thing i can do is ride the wave & wait until it passes.\n  \n  otherwise, my boyfriend's words and actions have the potential to cheer me up if i'm upset, overwhelmed, anxious, etc etc. he always knows what to say to help me.\n  ","414901":"\n  above all else, i hope askfm improves their blocking\/reporting system. there are plenty of users on this site who can make endless accounts and continually harass others, while people who are productive members of the site get banned for no reason whatsoever.\n  ","414902":"\n  i don't greet my neighbors. however, it depends on the individual and how close i am to them. my greeting changes depending on who its with.\n  ","414903":"\n  i'm sure there are a lot of factors that play into the stereotype, but i'm honestly not going to research the history behind it right now.\n  ","414904":"\n  yes, i know quite a few people who are like that. i try to limit my communication with them as much as possible.\n  ","414905":"\n  i've never visited any of those countries before, and they've always been placed that i wanted to explore.\n  ","414906":"\n  i have had friends ruin my trust in them before, and i never sought revenge. i just ended up cutting them out of my life entirely.\n  ","414907":"\n  unfortunately, a nuclear bomb would be more detrimental to the environment than to the human race.\n  ","414908":"\n  i would personally confront him about it, especially considering how close you two are. the next time it happens, perhaps tell him, \"hey! my eyes are up here!\" or something along those lines, and then proceed to explain that it makes you uncomfortable when he does that.\n  ","414909":"\n  no, i don't mind discussing my prior relationships at all. my boyfriend is also open about his past relationships, it's been a topic of conversation for us on many occasions.\n  ","414910":"\n  i certainly hope so. the human race has wrecked havoc on this earth.\n  ","414911":"\n  i consider myself to be intelligent, but there is always room for improvement. no matter how much i've learned and continue to learn, there will always be subjects and ideas worth pursuing.\n  ","414912":"\n  perhaps 7\/10 in terms of weirdness. i'm not completely out there, but i do have particular quirks.\n  ","414913":"\n  yes, i play video games pretty regularly. lately i've been focused on fallout 76, but i also love the elder scrolls, assassin's creed, the bioshock series, halo, tomb raider, far cry, and minecraft, among other games.\n  ","414914":"\n  LOL. you're thinking of martin luther, who lived in the 16th century. martin luther king jr was a minister and activist of the 20th century who led the civil rights movement.\n  ","414915":"\n  my first job was at a drug store, i was a cashier.\n  ","414916":"\n  sometimes, i do enjoy life. last night, for example, was probably the most fun i've had in quite a long time. my boyfriend had a few of his friends over & we spent the night playing xbox and poker. i was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face at one point.\n  ","414917":"\n  when i was in high school, my favorite subject was english. i loved learning about different time periods of literature and studying classic novels.\n  ","414918":"\n  yes, i've always loved setting up camp in riften for some reason, LOL.\n  ","414919":"\n  occasionally, yes. i've learned how to cope more effectively with stress, but that unfortunately doesn't make the feeling of stress go away. sometimes it does catch me off guard and i panic.\n  ","414920":"\n  no, i'm not religious at all. i'm an athiest.\n  ","414921":"\n  me too !! i can definitely see myself living as a nord in the snowy mountains of skyrim, lol.\n  ","414922":"\n  i don't blame you -- i've always been uncomfortable changing in front of people too.\n  \n  personally, i would find a bathroom and change in there instead of getting changed around other people. although you also have to remember that other people likely have the same thoughts you do in that they don't want to be seen either, and they're more likely focusing on themselves rather than other people.\n  ","414923":"\n  i'm already friends with people whose perspectives and opinions differ from mine. if you surround yourself with people who thought exactly the same as you, then it becomes difficult for you to grow and see things from other points of view.\n  ","414924":"\n  i would probably love living in tamriel (the world in the elder scrolls video games).\n  ","414925":"\n  the lord of the rings will always be my favorite fantasy films.\n  ","414926":"\n  i don't buy chocolate, but i wouldn't consider such an act to be self indulgent. if an individual wants chocolate to eat, then they should have the freedom to buy chocolate.\n  ","414927":"\n  freshly cut grass, gasoline, snowfall, lavender, patchouli, dragon's blood, and roses.\n  ","414928":"\n  i was unaware that i was anything other than tame.\n  ","414929":"\n  the south is portrayed that way in the

 ","414935":"\n  since when has that been new ?? i've been saying that for years, lol.\n  ","414936":"\n  normally because i go 8+ hours without answering questions because i'm asleep and then i'm working, so questions accumulate by the time i get home.\n  ","414937":"\n  no, the only ginger thing i enjoy is ginger tea. i don't even eat ginger because the texture is weird to me.\n

vocabulary after a while.\n  ","414943":"\n  i've been in this situation for a few years now, and it doesn't really make a difference to me. my cousin & one of my close friends were best friends up until something put a rift in their friendship, and now they hate each other. however, i still see each of them separately pretty regularly.\n  \n  it's not something that's ever been an issue for me because they're both aware that i still see the other person. they just don't bother bringing their name up anymore.\n  ","414944":"\n  my first relationship somewhat ended on bad terms because of how hurt i was at the conclusion of it, and we ended up not talking for a few years subsequent to the breakup.\n  \n  however, we're best friends now so it doesn't matter much anymore.\n  ","414945":"\n  yeah, it's martin luther king jr. day. i'm fairly certain it's a federal holiday, post offices and government buildings are closed and whatnot.\n  ","414946":"\n  i've never been in a situation where someone was outwardly jealous of me, lol. however, if their feelings (and subsequent actions) are detrimental to my well being, then i would sit down and talk to them about the way they're feeling and if there's any way to help the situation at all.\n  ","414947":"\n  that isn't really something i can answer unless it actually happens. it would depend entirely on circumstance -- the reason why we broke up, my feelings towards him, my emotions overall, etc etc.\n  ","414948":"\n  my monday has been fine so far -- i got to work super early so i found a nice parking spot, i had a productive work day, and my commute home only took me 35 minutes !!\n  \n  i'm just eating dinner & then i'm going to head to my boyfriend's house to hang out with him and his friends.\n  ","414949":"\n  i usually eat avocado on toast with a fried egg, or on a BLT sandwich, or on a salad, or inside of sushi.\n  ","414950":"\n  i prefer to answer questions. i seldom ask questions anymore unless i'm incredibly bored & my feed is dead.\n  ","414951":"\n  i have a tellonym !! i don't really know what i think about it yet, considering there isn't much traffic on my page. but it's pretty much the same idea as

did yesterday, lmao. i'm excited to sit down and relax.\n  ","414957":"\n  i just got home from work, so not much at the moment. i'm about to heat up some dinner & then head back out to my boyfriend's

\"wildly into the dark\" by tyler knott gregson last week, and it's beautiful so far.\n  ","414980":"\n  just be yourself & the right person will come along. you shouldn't feel then need to be

you'll have to be more specific. i have no idea why you're saying \"why not.\"\n  ","415038":"\n  i'm indifferent. people can wear whatever they're most comfortable wearing, it doesn't make a difference in my life.\n  ","415039":"\n  friendship doesn't happen upon request. it normally happens naturally, not by a person asking someone else \"can we become friends?\" or anything.\n  \n

 broccoli.\n  ","415050":"\n  it's been all right. i gave up on writing so i've been watching the show \"you\" for the past hour or so.\n  ","415051":"\n  my family does, but i seldom watch cable tv.\n  ","415052":"\n  it isn't going to be a big snowstorm where i live -- mostly rain and ice. the temperatures are supposed to drop a lot, though.\n  ","415053":"\n  years, i suppose. although the only grudge that i've been holding onto has lasted over a year at this point, lmao.\n  ","415054":"\n  snow is beautiful to look at, but i absolutely hate everything else about it, lmao. shoveling snow, cleaning the snow off my car, and especially driving in snow.\n  ","415055":"\n  no, i already get enough notifications from askfm, so i wouldn't want to be notified when one of my friends posts an answer.\n  ","415056":"\n  i'm all right -- just tired, so i'm attempting to caffeinate myself in the hopes of finishing something i've been writing.\n  ","415057":"\n  yes, i see myself getting married in the future. i think it's an exquisite celebration of love.\n  ","415058":"\n  i prefer the cold over the heat. i absolutely hate being hot, but at least if i'm cold, i can bundle up and wear a lot of cozy layers.\n  ","415059":"\n  LOL, yes. that happens to me every now and again, and then i immediately back up and say, \"wait, no. i didn't mean it sarcastically, i was genuine, i'm so sorry. PLEASE FORGIVE ME.\"\n  ","415060":"\n  i don't believe that there's such a thing as saying \"i love you\" too much. i think people should express their love for their friends, families, and partners more often because you simply don't know when you won't have someone around anymore.\n  ","415061":"\n  i normally wake up between 7:25 and 7:40am, and i get dressed for the day, take my medication, use the bathroom and brush my teeth, wash my face and brush my hair, and pack my lunch for the day. in the mornings, i normally stop by dunkin or starbucks or 7-11 for coffee before i head into work.\n  ","415062":"\n  honestly, sometimes my first thoughts are \"is it worth it to call out of work today?\" LOL. i've been so tired lately, i need a day to just sleep in and do absolutely nothing.\n  ","415063":"\n  i'm currently wearing pajamas, lmao. i'm wearing a thin hoodie because it's super cozy. it also still smells like downy softener.\n  ","415064":"\n  yes, i value my alone time A LOT. i need at least one or two hours of alone time per night, otherwise i become restless and exhausted and an anxious mess.\n  ","415065":"\n  i've never really brushed my teeth in a strange place tbh. the only places i've brushed my teeth are my house, my boyfriend's house, and whatever hotel i'm staying at if i'm traveling somewhere.\n  ","415066":"\n  not at the moment. it snowed early this morning, though. it was barely an inch, but it was enough to make other people drive erratically on the road.\n  ","415067":"\n  when i'm sleeping alone, i use four pillows, a heavy down comforter, and i usually have some sort of dim light on, whether it's the blue light of my fish tank or a small set of string lights that surround my tv. i take up the entire bed.\n  \n  when i'm sleeping with my boyfriend, we're usually back-to-back and i have the terrible tendency to steal the blankets in the middle of the night, so sometimes he gives me my own blanket, lmao.\n  ","415068":"\n  during the summer, i always sleep with a fan on because it gets so hot and humid in the house. the noise sorta bothers me, but i need the air circulation.\n  \n  during the winter, i don't use a fan.\n  ","415069":"\n  it depends on my mood !! sometimes i use french vanilla creamer, while other times i take it with one scoop of stevia and a splash of half-n-half (although lately i've been using sweet cream).\n  \n  as for tea, i usually drink different flavored green teas, but when i drink english breakfast or earl grey tea, i like one scoop of sugar and a small splash of milk.\n  ","415070":"\n  i like my sense of humor, my passion for writing and art, and my loyalty to my friends.\n  \n  i dislike my impulsive nature, my tendency toward giving into my desires (i have zero self control), and my mental illnesses.\n  ","415071":"\n  THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY. this week went horridly slow, and i'm looking forward to staying home for two days straight, lmao (with the exception of seeing my boyfriend tomorrow night).\n  \n  my only plans are to drink a lot of coffee, do laundry, finish my freelance assignments, and finish my personal essay.\n  ","415072":"\n  when i want to get to know someone, i ask them what their passions and ambitions are. you can learn a lot about a person by noticing what they're passionate about and what they want to succeed at in their life.\n  ","415073":"\n  there isn't anything i'm really looking forward to because i don't have anything planned in the future.\n  \n  i'm looking forward to seeing my boyfriend this weekend, but that's all. he cleaned and bought new furniture, so i'm excited to spend time with him and relax on his new couch.\n  ","415074":"\n  i only ever drank it as a child, and i don't remember if i liked the taste or not.\n  ","415075":"\n  facebook, solely because i get most of my memes from there and people interact with me more on facebook compared to twitter. twitter is good for my random thoughts, but hardly anyone follows me and only close friends like my tweets.\n  ","415076":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","415077":"\n  i'm assuming you mean painting, drawing, etc etc. if so, then i honestly can't remember the last time i painted or drew. it's been months.\n  ","415078":"\n  honesty is the ability to be forthright and sincere with both yourself and those around you, lacking fabrications.\n  ","415079":"\n  respect is having admiration or appreciation of an individual due to the content of their character, their positive attributes, their contributions to their community, and\/or their opinions.\n  ","415080":"\n  at my worst, i'm impulsive, self-sabotaging, keen to giving into my compulsions, and bitter.\n  \n  at my best, i'm creative, compassionate, open-minded, and empathetic.\n  ","415081":"\n  yes, it happens quite often to me, unfortunately. usually it had to do with work where i would have no choice but to work with a person i didn't like, but i would obviously remain civil with them in order to be more efficient.\n  ","415082":"\n  well, yeah. you're anonymous so it's not as if you have anything to lose.\n  ","415083":"\n  my boyfriend's smile and laughter, spending time with my boyfriend, relaxing with a cup of coffee after work, having my first cigarette of the day, catching up with friends over a few drinks, having a productive day at work, writing something i'm proud of, smelling snow in the air, having a bonfire with friends, and lighting candles.\n  ","415084":"\n  i prefer the park over the beach. i dislike the beach most of the time, it's too hot and i don't like going into the water anyway. the only reason why i would go to the beach is to drink beer and get a suntan.\n  \n  the park, on the other hand, is one of my favorite places. there are so many parks in my region and they're all beautiful. i used to bring my camera and take a lot of photos of nature.\n  ","415085":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree. also, apparently the government isn't doing as many inspections on food items due to the shutdown, so we have to be extra cautious about the food we buy.\n  ","415086":"\n  no, quite the opposite actually. i have a lot of patience and nothing really pushes me to anger unless a person attacks a close friend of mine or my boyfriend.\n  ","415087":"\n  last week, i believe. i don't remember the reason why, although sometimes it happens without real reason.\n  ","415088":"\n  i'm interested in politics, but i'm definitely not an invested in it as i was in the past. i like to remain up to date, though.\n  ","415089":"\n  i never skipped classes when i was in high school, but i skipped classes occasionally when i was in college. most of the time, it was because i had assignments and papers to finish and didn't have enough time during the day to complete them.\n  ","415090":"\n  if i have any enemies, they haven't made themselves known to me. lmao.\n  ","415091":"\n  i have the samsung galaxy s7.\n  ","415092":"\n  depends on my mood -- i like a whole range of genres. i mainly listen to alternative rock, nu metal, hip hop\/rap, and video game\/movies soundtracks, though.\n  ","415093":"\n  no, i don't trust people easily at all. i'm very hesitant to trust people and i don't trust others until they prove their loyalty to me or give me a reason to trust them.\n  ","415094":"\n  yes, i'm quite passionate about music. music has helped me when no one else was there to support me, and it makes me feel utterly alive.\n  ","415095":"\n  i purchased my current phone about three years ago.\n  ","415096":"\n  writing, sleeping, playing video games, working, and drinking alcohol.\n  ","415097":"\n  i honestly don't remember. i don't watch movies very often. it was probably one of the harry potter movies when they were on television for the holidays.\n  ","415098":"\n  the only thing i did today was go to work. i just got home not too long ago, and now i'm drinking coffee & listening to music.\n  \n  i was going to finish writing an essay that i've been working on, but i need to brainstorm because i have no idea how to end it.\n  ","415099":"\n  work is going well !! there's a surplus of work to do, so i'm always busy, which keeps my mind off of things. i also picked up some freelance work to do this weekend for some extra money.\n  ","415100":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","415101":"\n  no, i have no intentions of buying a PS4. i'm happy with the xbox one.\n  ","415102":"\n  i usually eat oatmeal or a yogurt parfait, but occasionally i like to treat myself with an egg sandwich from the deli.\n  ","415103":"\n  i probably wouldn't do anything. it isn't my business and i couldn't care less about what my parents do in their spare time.\n  ","415104":"\n  my job caters lunch every friday afternoon, but that's the only routine thing that happens in my life. otherwise, it depends entirely on the week.\n  ","415105":"\n  his impact upon my life was so great when i was a teenager that i owe my life to him. i struggled through a lot when i was much younger, and linkin park's music and his writing and perspectives on things really inspired me to keep holding on. he fueled my creativity and allowed me to write out my feelings instead of keeping them within it. it kept me sane.\n  ","415106":"\n  this is so sweet. thank you so much ~~\n  ","415107":"\n  no, celine is a woman.\n  ","415108":"\n  yeah, i respect her a lot as both a person and an artist.\n  ","415109":"\n  LOL. this is the way gender works -- everyone is different.\n  ","415110":"\n  i don't own a PS4, so unfortunately i don't have any game recommendations.\n  ","415111":"\n  i know. that's why when the other said millions was more probable, i agreed with them.\n  ","415112":"\n  that's indeed true. i prefer masculine compliments over feminine compliments. however, i'm aware that i pass as a woman which is why it also doesn't bother me if people give me feminine compliments.\n  ","415113":"\n  i picked up some freelance work for extra money, so i'm planning on completing those as well as finishing the essay i've been writing all week.\n  ","415114":"\n  definitely. i already have two more designs in mind.\n  ","415115":"\n  because i pass as a woman. even though i'm non-binary, i have very feminine features.\n  ","415116":"\n  i didn't say very few people, obviously millions of people is quite a large number.\n  ","415117":"\n  i've never had \"blonde moments\" because that's just a stereotype.\n  ","415118":"\n  you're also not the first person to have said this either, a few people on askfm have made this comparison.\n  ","415119":"\n  you're not the first person to say that, actually !! it must be the hair, lol.\n  ","415120":"\n  medical degrees are doctorates, lol. doctorate is an umbrella term for anything from a PhD to an MD to a DBA or DMin.\n  ","415121":"\n  my initial answer referenced doctorates. the original anon asked about successful people, so i figured they meant in a professional context.\n  ","415122":"\n  since when have i ever claimed to be \"woke\" ?? lmao.\n  \n  also, that's the third time you said the whole \"typical white person\" bit. if you're so pressed, then leave my page, unfollow me, or block me. it's that simple.\n  ","415123":"\n  i'm not lying, and you should learn how not to be so salty. you've dragged this on for three days, find something more important to b*tch about, rofl.\n  ","415124":"\n  dark blonde.\n  ","415125":"\n  i just took an anti-anxiety pill & i'm going to try to drift off to sleep.\n  ","415126":"\n  watercolor painting has always appealed to me, it's so beautiful and it's also a lot of fun to do.\n  ","415127":"\n  i love photography !! i used to be an avid photographer in the past, and it's something i've been wanting to get involved in again.\n  ","415128":"\n  basically any of the fetish questions that get thrown at me are the weirdest questions, especially considering they're always unwarranted and completely random.\n  ","415129":"\n  blackberries are too bitter for my liking.\n  ","415130":"\n  smoking cigarettes, smoking marijuana, drinking alcohol, skin-picking, food restricting, etc etc. the list goes on and on, lmao.\n  ","415131":"\n  LOL. like ... i don't know if it's *as* bad to me personally, but that's still really bizarre to me. people have absolutely no mindfulness of their surroundings, or they simply don't care. why can't they wait to do those things at home ?? why must they torture the rest of us ?? why ??\n  ","415132":"\n  you're in an office with 20+ other people sitting closely around you. why would you choose the office to be the ideal location to clip your fingernails ?? it makes literally zero sense.\n  \n  it happened routinely with my last job and it drove everyone wild. i never knew who was doing it, but every time they would start clipping their nails, my coworker and i would stare at each other in mutual disgust.\n  ","415133":"\n  i prefer masculine titles\/compliments over feminine ones.\n  ","415134":"\n  people snorting\/grunting at their desk like animals, people chewing food with their mouths wide open, people clipping their fingernails at their desk (YES, THIS HAPPENS !!), people who are overall bad at driving and insist they always have the right of way, etc etc.\n  ","415135":"\n  at this point in my life, there's really no such thing as too much coffee for me. LOL. i'm the king of being over-caffeinated.\n  ","415136":"\n  not surprisingly, i'm doing the same thing now as i was two hours ago -- listening to music and drinking coffee.\n  \n  this will be my last cup, though. otherwise i'll just end up dehydrating myself completely.\n  ","415137":"\n  i heard really good things about that spiderman game !! i've never been the biggest fan, but the gameplay i've seen looked a lot of fun.\n  \n  ah, god of war. my boyfriend was obsessed with those games back in the day, and he contemplated purchasing a PS4 solely so he could play the new god of war game, lol.\n  ","415138":"\n  yes, absolutely. my relationship is perhaps one of the best things that has ever happened to me. i've never had such a strong, solid beacon of support before, and even after 10 years of being together, we still haven't run out of things to talk or laugh about. every day is a new adventure.\n  ","415139":"\n  halloween has always been my favorite holiday. i love the creepy decor, the horror movies, the seasonal drinks and foods, the chilly weather, etc etc.\n  ","415140":"\n  yes, i agree !! that game literally blew my mind. i still have it installed on my console, perhaps i'll play it through again one day. it was hella fun.\n  \n  i ended up having a solid 1-2 months of playing solely bioshock because i bought the bioshock collection for a reduced price a few years ago. i was completely captivated.\n  ","415141":"\n  like i said earlier -- that unfortunately isn't how mental illness works. my boyfriend has, thankfully, always been incredibly understanding and supportive. but just because you're in a relationship, that doesn't magically make mental illness disappear. you can still experience love and support while struggling through episodes.\n  ","415142":"\n  open world role-playing games and first person shooters.\n  \n  my favorite games are skyrim, the fallout series (minus 1 and 2, i never played those), destiny, tomb raider, the bioshock series, the halo series, minecraft, assassin's creed, and life is strange.\n  ","415143":"\n  ???\n  \n  there's really no correlation between my mental health and my boyfriend. you're not suddenly happy simply because you're in a relationship. unfortunately that isn't how mental illness works. i only started feeling \"better\" once i sought out treatment for my mental health, i.e. attending therapy sessions regularly and taking medication.\n  ","415144":"\n  hot chocolate is good, but sometimes it can be a bit too sweet for me.\n  ","415145":"\n  -- coffee\n  \n  -- cigarettes\n  \n  -- my psychiatric medication\n  \n  -- music\n  \n  -- water\n  ","415146":"\n  no, english is the only language i know.\n  ","415147":"\n  we've been together for nearly 10 years.\n  ","415148":"\n  here, have a picture that's so old that i have literally zero idea of what year it's from ;\n  ","415149":"\n  sometimes, but not really. pasta is just empty carbs, unless it's whole wheat pasta.\n  ","415150":"\n  yes, i do have a boyfriend.\n  ","415151":"\n  yes, vegetables are probably my favorite food group !! they're so versatile and can be seasoned in a variety of ways, and it honestly boggles my mind when people say they dislike vegetables.\n  ","415152":"\n  my favorite meal depends entirely on my mood in that moment. but lately, i've been craving sushi constantly.\n  ","415153":"\n  i'm not happy with my life in the present moment, but i feel a lot better now compared to nine years ago.\n  ","415154":"\n  i appreciate both digital and traditional art. like\n  \n   @Courrtana\n  \n  said in her response, they both require an immense amount of skill and practice, so artists should be respected regardless of whichever style they choose.\n  ","415155":"\n  no, lemonade is too sweet for my taste.\n  ","415156":"\n  LOL, atrocious. i was severely depressed, so i was drunk and high every day when i wasn't attending classes.\n  ","415157":"\n  travel across the country, first and foremost, as well as travel to other countries. i want to visit so many places within the united states, like oregon and washington and alaska, and i want to also see australia, new zealand, and europe.\n  ","415158":"\n  that depends entirely on what the item is. things have different values, so $50 for a tube of mascara, for example, is a lot different than $50 for a television.\n  ","415159":"\n  no, not really. i've never had a sweet tooth, and the only sweets i'll eat are rainbow cookies or cannolis on rare occasions (usually on birthdays or holidays).\n  ","415160":"\n  i don't remember a large majority of my past, but the aspects of it that i do remember, i definitely don't miss at all.\n  ","415161":"\n  lmao, no. the united states is embarrassing at this point.\n  ","415162":"\n  it's a subgenre of alternative metal that also incorporates influences from other genres, like hip hop or grunge.\n  ","415163":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry.\n  ","415164":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 27 years old.\n  ","415165":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","415166":"\n  yes, i most certainly do have work tomorrow.\n  ","415167":"\n  in 2019, i want to progress further with my mental health, as well as advocate more on behalf of those struggling with mental illness. i want to write more often, with more passion & fire than ever before. i want to get back on that health kick and begin working out again and losing weight.\n  ","415168":"\n  i play poker with my friends occasionally, but that's pretty much it. we usually play texas hold'em.\n  ","415169":"\n  i look for someone with a sense of humor, someone who's loyal, someone who knows how to have a genuine conversation, someone who is intelligent, someone who is good with animals, and someone who is willing to put up with my bullsh*t.\n  \n  thankfully, my boyfriend is all of those things. :'))\n  ","415170":"\n  i like surrealism the most. salvador dali is one of my favorite artists.\n  ","415171":"\n  i just stepped outside to have a cigarette. when i'm done, i'm going to go back inside, maybe make myself some dinner, and take my medication.\n  ","415172":"\n  if i didn't like twitter, then i wouldn't use it. lmao.\n  \n  it's an interesting platform, though. i don't really tweet very often, but i mainly retweet things that interest me or make me laugh.\n  ","415173":"\n  my half-sleeve took the longest to do. i think i was sitting there for maybe 5-6 hours straight.\n  ","415174":"\n  no, i'm not vegan. however, when i do wind up living independently, i want to slowly transition to a vegetarian diet because i think it would be healthier for me.\n  ","415175":"\n  my day was a bit difficult in the beginning, but it got easier as time progressed. i woke up feeling absolutely terrible and almost didn't go in to work, but i managed to make it there (i would have felt even more horrible if i had called out, anyway).\n  \n  the first few hours, i couldn't focus on my work, but it got better as time went on. right now, i'm feeling pretty good actually. :'))\n  ","415176":"\n  i listen to a range of genres, i.e. alternative rock, nu metal, hip hop\/rap, instrumentals (like video game and movie soundtracks), classical, etc etc.\n  \n  these days, my most-played artists have been grandson, matt maeson, bryce vine, two feet, and imogen heap (she did the entire harry potter & the cursed child OST).\n  ","415177":"\n  the only cookies i eat -- if you can consider them cookies -- are rainbow cookies. i also eat cannolis, but those are more like pastries.\n  ","415178":"\n  i prefer cold weather over warm weather. i can't stand the feeling of being hot or sweaty, and i would rather live somewhere that experiences autumn and winter seasons above all else.\n  ","415179":"\n  the social media sites i mainly visit are facebook, instagram, twitter, and snapchat.\n  ","415180":"\n  no, insults hardly ever offend me. insults say a lot more about the person who's attempting to insult you than it does about you. most people insult others out of a need for attention, or because they're unhappy with an aspect of themselves and they don't want to reflect upon it, or because they have a complex and can't admit when they're wrong.\n  ","415181":"\n  no, i don't like pineapple at all -- unless it's mixed with rum.\n  ","415182":"\n  at the moment, no. LOL. my best friend borrowed my DSLR last year and i keep forgetting to take it back from her, so it's just been sitting at her mother's house collecting dust.\n  ","415183":"\n  no, i don't like anime. the only anime-esque things i really enjoy are studio ghibli films.\n  ","415184":"\n  i enjoy pizza sometimes, sure. i usually have a grandma or margherita slice.\n  ","415185":"\n  i feel like this is a strange question to ask, considering how these days, everyone owns a smartphone -- so technically speaking, everyone is *always* online, it's just a matter of whether or not someone is looking at their phone.\n  ","415186":"\n  no, i don't play any instruments currently. when i was a teenager, i enjoyed playing the guitar and the keyboards, and i even owned a ukulele for a brief period of time. but i haven't been interested in creating music in years.\n  ","415187":"\n  no, i've never been a fan of call of duty. however, i do like *some* first person shooters, i.e. halo and destiny.\n  ","415188":"\n  i have the samsung galaxy s7.\n  ","415189":"\n  yeah, so that would be december 31st. i put PTO in for my request so i would still get paid for the day.\n  ","415190":"\n  no, not lately. admittedly, i've been watching the show \"you\" routinely (even though i'm only up to episode six), but i go in phases when it comes to television.\n  ","415191":"\n  does the weekend count ?? LOL.\n  \n  the last day i took off of work was december 31st. i felt like having a four-day weekend since my office was closed on new years day.\n  ","415192":"\n  i've only owned xbox products, so it would have to be the xbox one.\n  ","415193":"\n  no, i've never been a fan of sports. i think the only sport that i *might* enjoy is ice hockey, simply because watching competitive games is really entertaining.\n  ","415194":"\n  it depends on my mood because i love both tea & coffee. these days, i've been drinking mostly coffee but i'll normally have a cup of tea mid-afternoon or right before bed (usually earl grey or peppermint or ginger peach).\n  ","415195":"\n  i ate a bag of doritos a few hours ago while i was at work.\n  ","415196":"\n  yes, i work in an office building.\n  ","415197":"\n  it's currently 7:20pm EST.\n  ","415198":"\n  i haven't been off of medication in over two years, so i don't know how i would be anymore & i don't really want to find out.\n  \n  prior to starting medication, i was severely unstable, actively svicidal, and too depressed to leave my bed or shower.\n  ","415199":"\n  all of the above. coffee tastes delicious, it makes me feel wonderful, and it gives me a much-needed caffeine boost.\n  ","415200":"\n  AW, THAT SOUNDS ADORABLE.\n  \n  yeah -- when i think of pride, i think of NYC pride and the chaos that happens there, rofl.\n  ","415201":"\n  i'm left-handed, actually.\n  \n  which is amusing because the IT guy came to my office earlier this week to update everyone's software, and he was struggling to use my mouse because it's on the left side and i guess he would have felt rude if he had moved it, LOL.\n  ","415202":"\n  ~~ abandonment ~~\n  ","415203":"\n  i prefer talking to people in person. i'm not great at texting other people back & i often forget that i'm having a conversation with someone since i don't use my phone at all throughout the work day.\n  ","415204":"\n  i prefer responding to questions. i seldom ask questions these days & i only do so when my feed is dead and i'm looking to kill some time.\n  ","415205":"\n  tbh pride isn't really something i've ever wanted to attend. i like looking at people's pictures, but walking around in a crowd full of people makes me extremely anxious, so i don't think i would enjoy it.\n  \n  as for your second question, yes -- i love art.\n  ","415206":"\n  my xmas was fine and went a little better than expected, given the circumstances i was dealt at the time. i really had a lot of fun when i saw my boyfriend and his family, though. they always make me feel welcome and at home, like i'm a part of their family.\n  ","415207":"\n  i've never had a fling before, so no. that's never happened to me.\n  ","415208":"\n  as far as i'm aware, i'm fairly open-minded. i always try to view things as learning opportunities and even if i don't agree with someone's point of view, i try to understand why they think the way they do.\n  ","415209":"\n  yes, i've been driving since i was 19 years old.\n  ","415210":"\n  yes, i actually wore boots to work today because it was a bit chilly outside. i'll probably end up wearing them again tomorrow since it's supposed to snow tonight into tomorrow morning.\n  ","415211":"\n  i've driven through pennsylvania briefly, but there was no reason for me to stop there.\n  ","415212":"\n  yes, i've traveled up and down the east coast from maine to florida. however, i've never ventured further west.\n  ","415213":"\n  LOL. i'm honestly not sure what size it is, i just filled a big glass up with ice and made some iced coffee when i got home before.\n  ","415214":"\n  i've known i liked people of all varying genders since i was 11 years old, but i don't believe i actually came out to the public until i was 16 or so.\n  ","415215":"\n  i'm doing fine, thank you for asking. i just got home from work not too long ago & now i'm relaxing with my laptop, coffee, and some music from the harry potter & the cursed child OST.\n  ","415216":"\n  yeah, i answer questions every day. however, i might be seeing my boyfriend tomorrow evening, so i probably won't be very active at all.\n  ","415217":"\n  not in the literal sense of addiction, but generally speaking, yes -- they can be addictive depending on your personality. for people like me, once you get one tattoo, it's difficult to see yourself with *only* one tattoo, so you start planning more and more.\n  ","415218":"\n  i've unfortunately never attended a pride event\/parade before. they're usually always in manhattan and the idea of going into manhattan for a parade full of people seems daunting to me.\n  ","415219":"\n  i'm five feet tall.\n  ","415220":"\n  i love all of my tattoos, but i really cherish the meaning behind my tattoo dedicated to linkin park\/chester bennington. i got it a few weeks after he passed away.\n  ","415221":"\n  no, i meant bisexual. bisexual generally refers to two or more, while pansexual refers to all.\n  ","415222":"\n  yes, i'm doing just fine. i'm just performing my nightly routine -- sitting at my laptop, drinking coffee, and listening to music.\n  ","415223":"\n  i'm bisexual.\n  ","415224":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","415225":"\n  my birthday is november 18th.\n  ","415226":"\n  yes, i smoke both cigarettes and marijuana and drink alcohol.\n  ","415227":"\n  i don't currently have any piercings, no. i used to have my labret and my nose pierced, though. i had my labret pierced for 3-4 years when i was in high school.\n  ","415228":"\n  they ranged anywhere from $100-500 each, but that's because they're all different sizes and i've gone to four separate tattoo artists to get them done.\n  ","415229":"\n  as i mentioned earlier, i have seven tattoos. they're on my shoulder blades, my upper arm and forearm, my ribcage, my thigh, the back of my calf, and my ankle.\n  ","415230":"\n  july 2017. i got two tattoos done in the same day.\n  ","415231":"\n  i normally take naps on the weekends, and they last between 1-3 hours long.\n  ","415232":"\n  yes, in a heartbeat. when i move into my own house\/apartment, i'm adopting an animal. although tbh i would probably be more inclined to adopt an older dog because there are so many older dogs left in shelters waiting to be adopted.\n  ","415233":"\n  i can't remember the last time i actually hugged a tree, if i ever have at all.\n  ","415234":"\n  yes, i'm an immensely loyal person. i don't make friends very easily, but i'm loyal to the ones i do have. i think loyalty is one of the most important things you can contribute to any form of relationship.\n  ","415235":"\n  no, not at all. my pain tolerance has lessened greatly over the past few years.\n  ","415236":"\n  my parents never witnessed me getting low marks on tests when i was in school.\n  ","415237":"\n  zero. i've never watched a royal wedding before.\n  ","415238":"\n  yeah, i play video games. lately i've been exclusively playing fallout 76 with my friends.\n  ","415239":"\n  it depends on your pain tolerance and where on the body you're getting the tattoo. my thigh and forearm didn't hurt me much at all, but the ribcage and calf hurt like hell.\n  ","415240":"\n  i currently have seven tattoos, but i have two more planned out.\n  ","415241":"\n  yes, i use *so* much softener, LOL. all of my clothes smell like downy softener and it makes me so happy.\n  ","415242":"\n  i usually buy the big jugs of starbucks black iced coffee & make it my own way -- usually with three pumps of vanilla sweetener and a splash of cream.\n  \n  as for hot coffee, it depends on my mood. sometimes i take it with a scoop of stevia and cream, while other times i prefer it without sweetener at all.\n  ","415243":"\n  uh, i did admit i was wrong -- it was the second question in this thread where an anon mentioned it was probably millions & i said \"that's probably more accurate.\"\n  \n  this entire thread was about success pertaining to doctorates, so idk where you got the assumption from that there was an underlying issue there.\n  ","415244":"\n  no, i'm not a hugger at all. i only hug my boyfriend and my best friend.\n  ","415245":"\n  how so ?? only thousands of people have a doctorate so i don't think it's a stretch at all.\n  ","415246":"\n  as far as i'm aware, no one that i talk to from askfm is transphobic.\n  ","415247":"\n  no. that's transphobic, and i wouldn't want to be friends with someone who's transphobic.\n  ","415248":"\n  well i wouldn't be civil with a person if they were intentionally being mean to me. i would just cut them out of my life in that situation.\n  \n  i also think there's a difference between being wrong and simply having a different opinion. you aren't necessarily wrong if your opinion differs from someone else's, but there are some opinions which *are* based on false information, which would make them wrong.\n  ","415249":"\n  depends on a variety of factors, i.e. who's telling me i'm rude, the tone of their voice, what we're talking about, etc etc. it would be different with every scenario.\n  ","415250":"\n  well yeah, that's part of being a civilized adult. as long as you respect each other's opinion, even if you don't necessarily agree with them, then that's all you can do.\n  "}}
