speculative tho . but interesting . this site is such a strange human experiment . too bad you can never see the data","357855":"how confusing is it when you get questions here but you dont know if they are specific to you or sent en mass ? also once you have seen them sent in mass does it change the way you feel about receiving the question then ? if so usually for the better or worse ?","357856":"how long did you research before maxwell purchase ? was that the first one of that type of product ?","357857":"serious question . do y all remember myspace ?","357858":"it was

thing to realize is these people see what we say about them and that changes what they do going forward . can motivate them to do more or less can also motivate copycats . its like messin with the time continuum wen we bring it up","357872":"well i suppose the medium has no little repercussions for the direction people go with things . thats just the name of the game here . but in a way you
