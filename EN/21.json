take on it would be that true love is hard , you need trust , loyalty , mutual respect , able to laugh until your stomach hurts with them , come to them when you are sad , mad or happy . be able to be their best friend and their significant other . even when you fight you could never think of not talking to them or letting them go to bed mad . there s just so much that comes into play for true love","20110":"lgbtq community friends they literally are some of the sweetest friends i ve ever had and they always make my day","20111":"no , i love my boyfriend with all my heart","20112":"it
