transforming","202115":"very similar but with metal bras . some also have pretty bows on their helmets","202116":"even if he could it would be extremely difficult to drain enough out of alien x to affect him . i suspect alien x would also have to project his energy for it to be absorbed . feedback couldn t just plug into him like an outlet","202117":"unfortunately there hasn t really been a

species","202230":"definitely not","202231":"oh dou s blog nice","202232":"now i can search my files with the model number","202233":"there are way more than one male and one female","202234":"always

her for some reason","202245":"listen . there s no gravity or up and down in space . and there s nothing for him to stand on . even if there was something for him to stand on he s just going to push himself away , not lifting anything . now stop sending me this question","202246":"thanks . i always had tom perkins do the fusions he s the best at it , but i did some roughs for tom s inspiration","202247":"you can call any insectoid an insectoid","202248":"nope","202249":"no","202250":"i m not clear on what you re asking","202251":"nothing","202252":"i have what you ve seen in the

incidental . i have a nemuina that s based on transformers raf that i wanted to do but ran out of time","202279":"which lewoden ?","202280":"probably most","202281":"jeez i wouldn t want to draw it","202282":"i wouldn t think so","202283":"i looked for that one and couldn t find it","202284":"jack nicholson and mark hamill","202285":"you d have to ask him what that means","202286":"ben has never shown he has the ability","202287":"nope","202288":"i don t know that she s declared yet","202289":"i didn t work on season","202290":"we called him nanobig","202291":"but neither of those guys are telepathic ?","202292":"we joked around that we should do a nanomech waybig fusion that would just be the size of a normal person","202293":"i imagine it s like a papaya with a core of honey","202294":"i don t consider nanomech to be part human","202295":"possible but not probable","202296":"possibly","202297":"probably","202298":"what characters like beast boy ?","202299":"they generally have a base white color with details in a primary or secondary color mostly red , blue , and yellow . some have pieces of metal colored armor","202300":"what ? no","202301":"sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t","202302":"oof . google translate fail ?","202303":"i m pretty sure that azmuth would have failsafes to prevent upgrades tampering with the omnitrix","202304":"probably","202305":"nope","202306":"oh my god stop the presses","202307":"yes , someone else","202308":"they would have to leave to survive","202309":"ragnarok and otto","202310":"brothers , but not twins","202311":"i ll try looking for the models","202312":"he s not in any of my sketchbooks , so they re probably in storage","202313":"they don t need to","202314":"no , they would have to keep dousing the victim","202315":"she would probably look more like ditto than the incidental","202316":"they don t really need to","202317":"is that something you need shots for ?","202318":"no jury riggs don t deal in organic materials much","202319":"i think it s too underground","202320":"that s a good perkins question","202321":"i thought so too","202322":"i have !","202323":"lol","202324":"i think this is interesting because you can see how bullfrag evolved from of a more normal looking incursean","202325":"you can figure it out","202326":"of course","202327":"not if it s out of the question","202328":"pok mon like merchandising potential","202329":"i did not say anything about power levels , only that it was possible they had a predator","202330":"he would be disintegrated fairly instantaneously","202331":"not human zombies , there s no life force left to drain","202332":"cooper is a mutant . but they also mean

sure","202336":"they can survive in space but are still vulnerable to cosmic rays ? what would the point of that be ?","202337":"that would be a difficult maneuver to accidentally do in your sleep","202338":"probably not yet","202339":"level","202340":"one green eye","202341":"yeah they were fun . i wish we had more ripjaws","202342":"call chadzmuth","202343":"i think he has one , you

for his artwork","202381":"nope , no names","202382":"i m not going to stop you","202383":"speed racer","202384":"i didn t see any","202385":"henshinku","202386":"shoplifting . but it was a , , tayden item","202387":"no because that s not ventriloquism","202388":"yep","202389":"not really regret , no . but if people prefer the skinny version i would change it if i

?","202399":"nope","202400":"they re always hacking the characters off the backgrounds and they mangle the line work in the process . i ve also seen some stuff that clearly has fan inks that are terrible . i can t remember which character that was though","202401":"bring it back , dawg","202402":"bullfrag , obviously","202403":"wow , where would he put the third one ? his ankle ? yeah they could definitely do it if they wanted to","202404":"no , i mean how a prototype is not a drawing . a prototype is something physical you build . toys have prototypes . cars have prototypes . machines have prototypes . cartoons have concept art . cartoons have development art . i know there are a lot of non native english speakers on the wiki , but it s an important distinction they should learn if they are going to write about these things as a matter of record . and it s a weird thing that only happens in the ben fandom for some reason","202405":"she s not","202406":"oh yeah , that s a great incentive . let me upload some art so they can destroy the line work for no reason","202407":"you re welcome . it s the first alien x question i didn t hate","202408":"attea maybe ? it s hard to choose . skurd was kind of difficult i guess because they sprung the idea on us so suddenly","202409":"okay . that s a lot different . that s like making a machine that would bring the dead or undead completely back to life . i don t think technology alone could possibly do it , not even cosmic power level technology . you would also need crazy powerful magic , which the jury riggs are not good at . i was having a lot of fun imagining the jury riggs invading anur transyl to fix it as an act of war . i m going to save that idea","202410":"ohhhhh i was thinking anur transyl . i read the question too fast . sorry","202411":"he did ? wtf no one ever told me !","202412":"but that would destroy it for its current inhabitants . is it an act of war by the jury riggs ? how many jury riggs does your friend say it would take ? is it their entire race ?","202413":"kaosseffexx ultimasauria","202414":"fix in what way ?","202415":"so he would never be human again ? why would that make sense ?","202416":"i think it s possible , but they could also end up in a universe that s not in line with their internal astronomy , and they could be rendered powerless . or a universe that just doesn t follow our universe s laws where their powers would be useless .","202417":"i never got the impression that paradox and azmuth are particularly close or work together too often","202418":"i understand the rules of the omnitrix very well","202419":"i don t know what to think about any of it","202420":"i thought it was confirmed there were dolphins and white lab mice","202421":"i m not sure that would work","202422":"it says that in the almanac but it s not true , that s definitely not hoist","202423":"a valuable power","202424":"he s a vreedle !","202425":"with a bow and eyelashes","202426":"i am vaguely aware","202427":"there are a lot of loboans","202428":"thanks","202429":"i think josh p rez designed him . you can ask him on twitter i know he has it","202430":"it would be funny if she didn t","202431":"nope","202432":"no , they aren t predators","202433":"does anybody ?","202434":"i m not sure actually","202435":"no , i wouldn t assume that","202436":"all of them","202437":"he probably ran against someone","202438":"he s a tag along that gets in gwen s way","202439":"definitely not possible","202440":"not really . i don t have the final versions of any of them","202441":"i just wish they would learn what a prototype is","202442":"not unless they are also a writer in our world","202443":"i don t","202444":"or something , i don t really remember","202445":"i don t know what to post , pretty much all the tf models are already out there","202446":"we haven t done him yet","202447":"very funny . that s sarcasm by the way","202448":"k e has pretty distinctive headgear","202449":"there s a little one on the same page","202450":"not really . i m not sure any of us really got generator rex","202451":"i think she s already heard it called omnitrix","202452":"i think she s a kineceleran diplomat or representative . i don t remember her being an older version of k e . did i say that before ?","202453":"i don t think so","202454":"i don t know how that happens . there were chemical reactions in his brain or something","202455":"he was elected","202456":"it s possible","202457":"nope","202458":"i would guess like four could lift one foot","202459":"no","202460":"wildvines","202461":"it is what it is . i can t live my life worrying about what some wiki is doing","202462":"i am not ?","202463":"more seasons ? i don t think so","202464":"i m not sure if it will happen . i ve previously said he s not an alien we ve seen","202465":"no they have to guess","202466":"no","202467":"no . it s a result of the omnitrixes being linked","202468":"his right hand is posed with his fingers pointing down . he s not holding anything","202469":"it took me forever to find this question again ! shwew !","202470":"i was so excited , but those aren t galvan","202471":"huh ? did you attach the wrong picture ?","202472":"that was a while ago i thought","202473":"they would work on a pyronite until the heatblast could will a flare up to burn them off","202474":"that wouldn t help him here . the corruptura themselves are a crystalline entity","202475":"yes","202476":"i guess i d have to research why he was immune","202477":"they could disintegrate them or shrink them to almost nothing . they could separate all the atoms in the worst s body and spread them across the universe . they could transform the worst s solid body into a liquid , then soak it up with a giant sponge . they could transform the worst into a hot pocket . they could remove all the water from the worst s body turning it into a powder . or they could just blink it out of existence","202478":"corruptera are resilient but they could be burned off with a small flare up","202479":"no , he has whatever is his equivalent of brain waves are so he s still susceptible","202480":"some do","202481":"they probably can embed themselves into a goop body making it even more difficult to remove","202482":"i can t remember","202483":"not that i know of","202484":"only if nrg can mimic the radiation of a star","202485":"i don t remember that one","202486":"yeah , me too . at least they made prototypes of forever ninja and vilgax","202487":"all the ones i came up with are already up on the wiki","202488":"no . i just had them in the back of my mind as some i wanted to use","202489":"it s not his face , it s a layer of tentacles over his face . i designed it for bandai","202490":"i just thought it would be cool to do","202491":"tfa strika and omniverse ben k","202492":"both","202493":"it probably was","202494":"maybe goop","202495":"he looks so sad and defeated . i guess he was never the same after servantis used him , but at least he got out !","202496":"you are asking the wrong person . go away and take your questions with you","202497":"it s funny that my offhand comments can be included as facts , but if i do something more legitimate they reject it . but it s not relevant , i don t do this stuff for a wiki . i do it because it s fun for josh and me , and other people also seem to enjoy it !","202498":"no , the cybertronian transformation is exclusively ben prime s","202499":"glen and dwayne","202500":"so i could get this question for the rest of my life","202501":"that s an odd one","202502":"probably , but wildmutt would actually be able to see aliens that are invisible to a normal spectrum","202503":"no","202504":"possibly nanomech , not the others","202505":"it seems like he has access to most of what ben does","202506":"oh anemone , i get it now . he can stretch out his tentacles and he can hold his eyeballs in his hands","202507":"well doglike animals love disgusting smells , but maybe swampfire could smoke them out","202508":"dun dun dun","202509":"yes","202510":"stinkfly","202511":"doubtful","202512":"meh","202513":"no","202514":"she doesn t ?","202515":"i wonder if she will change that after meeting the bens","202516":"the other inhabitants rose up against them","202517":"no , it s really all about ben learning how to deal with bellicus and serena","202518":"mrs . fife","202519":"she probably wouldn t have her yet","202520":"i don t think the ball weevils came until after atrocius was abandoned thousands of years ago . they developed a symbiotic relationship with the worsts after they settled other planets .","202521":"not ball weevil s home world , that s the worst s planet","202522":"probably not","202523":"their home world was atrocius , but it is now uninhabitable . they currently live on atrocius viiii , atrocius xii , atrocius xvi , and atrocius xxi , and throughout the galaxy","202524":"i don t think so . their skin might be slimy like an amphibian , but it s not the same as hobble","202525":"it doesn t seem like it , there aren t many of either around","202526":"toepick ! hey wildmutt s cute ! !","202527":"i think he d like to play street hockey with the xlr kids","202528":"as long as all of paradox is in one point of space and time , then yes","202529":"i think it s still ditto","202530":"no , ditto clones are all independent","202531":"i have no idea how to measure that","202532":"no","202533":"i don t really know , the titans models are hard to access because they are so old","202534":"ooh i don t","202535":"she s a crooked spiritualist","202536":"the little kid ? he can inflate his head","202537":"why wouldn t they be able to take them over ?","202538":"i have one","202539":"it depends . the atrocians and ball weevils living together i ve had for years . a lot are leftover ideas from the show","202540":"he looks like an ipod but doesn t seem to ever play any music","202541":"sad panda diss topia alien whatever don

he was really tired","202545":"ship is the upgrade version of a puppy","202546":"even if they are already asleep the nemuina would still need to dust the victim to access their dreams","202547":"literally nothing","202548":"in the outer regions of the galaxy , ball weevils form a semi symbiotic relationship with filthy disgusting alien races like the atrocians . the ball
