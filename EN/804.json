I've never been stuck in one, but there was a time where I had to go outside and shovel in one. Numerous times in the same storm. I had to make a path outside for my pups to be able to go to the bathroom. I had to use a cardboard box and a broom at first because the shovel was across the yard.. I wonder if I can expect something similar this coming winter...\n  ","862679":"\n  That's really not good! :( if you're able to I'd recommend taking note of how you're feeling \/ how often \/ when you get cramps, and speak to your doctor about it.\n  ","862680":"\n  I'll hit you up with some questions if you hit me up with some back!

How long will we (human beings, all of everyone's collective beginnings and ends) exist? Will there be a time where everything that ever was for us collapsed? Will there ever be a time where our history is unearthed and discovered by some other species? I just HAVE TO KNOW IF THERE'S AN END TO LIFE'S STORY!\n  ","862682":"\n  \u03a3(o'\u0434'o) I'm getting an alarming amount of shoutouts about people having cramps. For the last couple weekends now, I've gotten this! I'm starting to get worried.. if a warm compress, or pressing a pillow onto your abdomen for a while doesn't help, you might want to get checked out. Chronic cramping can be linked to many serious issues. Of course if this is a different person than the other two who were saying this via shoutout, you can ignore my warning! Do take care.\n  ","862683":"\n  I do plan on dressing up actually! I'm either gonna pull out my devil outfit, my angel outfit, OOOOOR my bunny outfit. Nurse outfit..? I have options. Whether or not I'm going anywhere however is a different story, what with the covid situation and all.\n  \n  Oh well.. no rules against being cute at home, right?\n  ","862684":"\n  I feel like the rift between the people and their government will continue, what with many people going into poverty and having their personal privacy threatened (among many other things). This is vague, but this is all I can see. (specifically speaking of the US by the way)\n  ","862685":"\n  Hey thanks, real kind if you to put that out there! \ud83c\udf80 It takes a lot to not be reactive with your emotions, or numb out certain things. The biggest part for me is reminding myself, \"You can't please everyone, happiness is simply pleasing yourself. Focus your attention on what really matters, not hateful people. They're not worth it.\". Stuff like that! But it takes time to truly believe in that mindset.\n  \n  I wish you the best of luck in finding that for yourself. Take care.\n  ","862686":"\n  I don't let people get on my nerves. If someone acts a certain way, they don't deserve to be around me. Those kinds of people aren't worth the time or energy to entertain. So I guess to fully answer your question, it would take a lot for something to actually upset me.\n  ","862687":"\n  The hilight of my week was one of my goodnight calls with my partner (\ud83c\udf40)! We had one of our longest calls yet, which almost ended in him falling asleep. UGH HIS SLEEPY VOICE IS SO CUTE!!\n  ","862688":"\n  It's not up to me to correct another person's perspective of myself, nor is it ever mandatory that I prove myself to anyone. It would be a complete waste of my time to try and pacify everyone's empty criticisms.\n  \n  No one on here knows me past a very surface level. And if you want to weigh in on how \"logical\" you think I am with the bare minimum information you have on me.. that sounds like a You problem. Not a Me problem. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","862689":"\n  If you feel that you've accidentally hurt your friend, the only right thing to do is talk about it! Communication is key for silent \"issues\" such as these. Make some time to talk to your friend about it. Bring it up and ask if you hurt them. Hear them out if it comes to be that you did, and see if you can work it out from there.\n  ","862690":"\n  Nope! An apology doesn't heal someone from losing someone they love. The only thing that heals a person from that is Time!\n  ","862691":"\n  I hope your Friday is going well! Take care of yourself and (especially if you plan on going out) be safe and sanitary! \ud83c\udf3f I hope this Friday jumpstarts you into a great weekend regardless. \u208d\u1422\u25cd\u02d8(\u2762)\u02d8\u25cd\u1422\u208e \ud83d\udcad\ud83c\udf75\n  ","862692":"\n  Oh, do I have something to share for this question..\n  \n  Well. Me and my partner (\ud83d\udc7d) were at the mall and we were walking about trying to find something to eat. I hadn't had a chicken panini in a while, and this one \"healthy\" food stall was selling them sooo we ate there. The food and drinks tasted off. Waaay off. Later, did we both find out through hours of sickly suffering that it was SO BAD that we got food poisoned.\n  \n  It hit me first, and the worst. It hit him in the middle of the night. It would not be an exaggeration to say that we both felt like we were dying.\n  ","862693":"\n  \ud83d\ude4f\u263a\ufe0f\n  ","862694":"\n  Failure used to dissuade me from trying again. But where I am right now, I feel that failure neither dissuades or encourages me. I get encouragement from knowing that I'll be better off once something is taken care of and over with!\n  ","862695":"\n  Nope! But there was a while there where tiger king was all I was hearing about. I didn't know why, but I didn't really bother making time to find out!\n  ","862696":"\n  I'm not the best person to ask about this, seeing as I'm not an \"emo guy\". Or really an \"emo\" person in general BUT. People who call themselves \"emo\" typically revolve their lifestyle, personality, appearance, and fashion sense around \"emocore\". What comes to mind as emocore things are: angst, moodiness, the color black, \"softer\" guitar based rock...\n  \n  That's all I know! I can't speak for everyone who identifies with emocore but that's what the general concept has been based around iirc.\n  ","862697":"\n  Overall not too bad. The tiniest bit tired, but it's kinda on me for staying up late.\n  ","862698":"\n  (Because of Lore Olympus more than ANYTHING,) I would have to become Persephone: goddess of spring. I would want to use my powers to cause plant life to flourish.\n  ","862699":"\n  I feel like it would almost be more upsetting of a fact if you keep count!! \u2211(\u0e51\u00ba\u53e3\u00ba\u0e51) when I was single, I wouldn't keep track of stuff like that. I'd just let it go and move with the passage of time. And eventually I found love again. Don't lose hope!\n  ","862700":"\n  I don't believe anyone \"needs\" makeup necessarily. But doing makeup is less about \"needing\" it and more about doing it because it's a hobby! And it adds a little glam to your look. It emphasizes one's favorite features. Makeup is actually really fun, even though I seldom ever do it past lipgloss \/ lipstick. I can clearly see the joy people get from doing it \/ having it done. And that kind of joy is never wrong.\n  ","862701":"\n  Oh, no no. I haven't been to a salon for a FULL cut in a long time. Not since I was in 6th grade. I did however go to a salon to get my bangs done the first time. Past that I trimmed them myself!\n  ","862702":"\n  I wish I could get mine legally changed, but I don't think there's any laws passed here that indicates the legal recognition of nonbinary folks. Shit fucks. It's really isolating.\n  ","862703":"\n  Thanks, you too! We're another day closer to Friday. Let's push through this!\n  ","862704":"\n  Francis Forever, by Mitski. My partner (\ud83c\udf40) sang it to me while holding my hands as we sat on his living room floor my last night visiting there. It's a song that has a special place in my heart, and I know all of the lyrics to it. Even now just thinking about it I'm tearing up.\n  ","862705":"\n  Things for me are going pretty okay at the moment! I'm just trying to vibe through my shift. I really hope you and your loved ones are managing to stay safe and be well! Sounds like a scary situation to be in.\n  ","862706":"\n  Nope! I've never really had to, since I've not ever had much change. I usually get leftover money in bills, and any change I do get usually gets spent on the next thing paid in physical money.\n  ","862707":"\n  I don't think that's outwardly fake, no. If anything I feel like it depends on the reason you're doing it..? Or maybe you don't have a reason for it. I feel like social adaptation is often inadvertently something we all do. It's almost a knee jerk reaction for us to be people-pleasers in our social lives, because pleasing others keeps them around. And keeping people you like around pleases you.\n  \n  Overall, it would be one thing if you were doing it to be spiteful to these \"different people\" behind their backs and act like they're strangers when you're with others. However if you're doing it as a natural response, or to keep others happy, I don't necessarily think that's \"fake\". You're taking in the information around you and adapting based on what you come up with in that case.\n  ","862708":"\n  I've really only ever been able to sleep on a sofa by passing out from exhaustion. Sofas are definitely not comfortable. I always wake up in pain if I've slept on one. Gonna have to go ahead and choose a bed here.\n  \n  The only couch I'd ever be able to fall asleep on *comfortably* is The Big Comfy Couch.\n  ","862709":"\n  You're on anon so idk who this is, but thank you! \u22c6\n  ","862710":"\n  None! I don't at all fancy them.\n  ","862711":"\n  OH HEY thank you for the coins on my response. I thought everyone would hate it for sure KDJDHD\n  ","862712":"\n  The one that eats at me the most is the concept of the afterlife. I'm stuck on what to think about it. Because while I hope there is one, it all feels so.. impossible and impractical? I don't mean to clash with anyone's religious beliefs, so don't take any personal offense, but I just get eaten up by the idea that This Is It. That all we have is one go, and we fade out forever.\n  ","862713":"\n  I'm sorry to hear! Have you tried pressing a pillow to your abdomen? Usually when I have stomach cramps pressure using something soft (like a pillow or a plush) helps after a while. I feel like I gave this answer to someone else who had the same problem recently. Sorry! It's all I've got to suggest.\n  ","862714":"\n  I feel as though it's highly inconsiderate because that's basically sibling hopping. It's usually what someone does when they're confused on what they really want. Plus I mean, it's almost an insult to your ex. She'll have to sit there miserable watching you court her sister, who she'll likely have a falling out with because she is with her ex. So not only will your ex have lost a partner, but also she would have lost a sister. That's pretty low honestly.\n  ","862715":"\n  My Instagram is in a button on my carrd. It's linked on my profile!\n  ","862716":"\n  IT KINDA IS THOUGH so I feel your pain. I'll do my best to explain stuff if you ever need help on something specific.\n  ","862717":"\n  Aw heck that's sad :( unfortunately they're really fragile. But I hope he's doing okay too! And I'm hoping to find more of these cool little blue guys to take pictures of. I've not taken enough pictures of my interests outdoors, and I need to get on that.\n  ","862718":"\n  barbecue!\n  ","862719":"\n  no ty\n  ","862720":"\n  I'm sorry to hear that! I might be late to this, seeing as I just woke up. But usually what I do when I get a stomach ache is hold something soft against my stomach. Like a really fluffy pillow, or a big stuffed animal. And I make sure to apply steady central pressure to the object on my stomach. After some time passes, I usually feel better.\n  \n  I hope you're doing okay!\n  ","862721":"\n  Mine? No. But the tears of my enemies however...\n  ","862722":"\n  You know what? Allergies are a freaking bummer! It's only within the last few years that I've started to suffer from seasonal allergies. Like one spring, I just suddenly stumbled into sniffly nose booger hell. And I never have been able to enjoy spring and summer the same...\n  \n  I used to never have these problems. It's like eventually I just \"unlocked\" them. Even as summer is ending, my allergy problems are fussing.\n  ","862723":"\n  Isn't he?? AAAAA I wish he came out of his shell. It has been a really long time since I'd seen one that was alive and healthy. Before if I'd see them at all, they'd be crushed or there would only be an empty husk of a shell. I'm bummed that when I finally stumbled upon a live one that I didn't get to take pictures of him fully.\n  ","862724":"\n  THANK YOU SO MUCH \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc9e It means a lot honestly. I hope that you're able to find the prosperity in love that you deserve. I'm rooting for you on that!\n  \n  Also, I live with \ud83d\udc7d. \ud83c\udf40 is in Maine and I visited him last month for a week actually so that was fun (we met irl for the first time!!). Aaand \ud83e\udd3c\u200d\u2642\ufe0f lives a city over from me. =^-^=\n  ","862725":"\n  Yesterday I took sone pictures of a cool snail I found! I used to see these lil guys all the time when I'd play in the dirt as a kid. But I haven't seen one in over TEN YEARS.. until yesterday. I picked him up and put him over in the dirt because he was in the driveway. I was worried about him getting ran over.\n  \n  Anyways, after all these years of being curious about them I learned what they are. They're blue \/ dark bodied glass snails! You can't see very well in the picture, but his lil slimy self (hiding in the shell) is BLUE. Yep. A blue snail. I think they're so neat.\n  ","862726":"\n  THIS IS SUCH A CUTE QUESTION FOR YOU TO ASK!! \ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc9e\ud83e\udd7a I'll describe them a bit, using my emoji key (for the sake of their individual comfort levels)...\n  \n  \ud83d\udc7d - 28, he\/him. He's like.. a true cryptid on the inside but is a total teddy bear on the outside. He has an interest in weird phenomenon and strange aesthetics. Very tech savvy to nearly the point of obsession (but I love him for it). Quite honestly he's the smartest person that I've ever known, and I've been fortunate enough to know him for nearly TEN YEARS NOW!! He's on the quiet side and won't say much unless prompted, but when he speaks his feelings you can feel it in your heart that he means it deeply and truly. He has a lot of love to give and I'm fortunate enough to be the sole recipient of that love. And I'm lucky that I get to know him more than anyone else. He's golden hearted.\n  \n  \ud83c\udf40 - 27, he\/him. The most charasmatic and fun person on the face of the planet. Definitely outwardly flamboyant and proud of it (and super cute for it). He's got so many stories and jokes to tell, and always references his favorite interests. Like, even down to obscure specific quotes from songs or shows. He has a memory that seems to record EVERYTHING, it's honestly impressive. And as big as his brain is, his heart is ten times the size with how sweet he is. He's truly a romantic person; always links me songs that make him think of me, makes me collages based off of my aesthetics to match with the selfies I send him, and helps me any way he can. He's so SWEET.\n  \n  \ud83e\udd3c\u200d\u2642\ufe0f - 27, he\/him. Fighting game enthusiast with every single cell in his body. He's all about Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Combat. Actually, he's been to a couple of fighting game tournaments this year alone to participate and go head to head with some of the top local players. But outside of his passion for the FGC and fighting games in general, he's a person full of love but shrouded in mystery. Our relationship is much more casual-- (OUT OF SPACE)\n  ","862727":"\n  they\/them! \ud83c\udf38 thank you for asking, and for asking so respectfully\n  ","862728":"\n  Personally I altogether feel the same age that I do physically; 22! A lot of people can easily pin down what they feel like mentally, but I overall can't think of a way to answer. Because, what really makes out \"mental\" age? Does it have to do with interests? Your personality type? Your level of intellect? That's all so complicated xkshdhhs I just know I'm me. And my body is 22. I don't think my core interest\/mindsets have changed much in the past few years (maybe not even since I was 18). But I've gained a lot of knowledge and insight on the world since then, and that all makes me feel mentally aged enough.\n  \n  This was a really good question! \ud83c\udf38 But maybe some day I can come up with a more conclusive answer to it, and not think too deeply on it JDHSHS\n  ","862729":"\n  I can only see so much from your profile picture, but I want to sayyy.. maybe 25?

First it's important that we separate the words \"love\" and \"romance\" if we are going to grasp any base understanding, however. Because while romance can be motivated by love, the two aren't the same! Love by itself is to feel intense care for something or someone.\n  \n  I feel like the purpose of love itself is  to be an influence on one's whole life. Love connects us to the places we live, the locations we favor, the people we make our friends, those we choose to be partnered with, etc. Most of the choices that we make revolve around it. Love is a feeling that helps us find out what we want to surround ourselves with, and it helps us know what makes us ultimately happy.\n  \n  Do I feel like love of any kind should be the only guiding compass in our subset of emotions? No. But I do feel like it plays one of the most significant roles in choice making and path taking. We are a curious species, brought into this world to give and receive over and over again until we are Done. With love influencing so much, it's one of the key elements that make that cycle continue.\n  ","862734":"\n  I don't vote on polls comparing people. It feels really rude and unnecessary to me. Just my opinion!\n  \n  Plus it's more often than not that people related polls are having their pictures used unknowingly, and that's a whole other weird vibe. Just ehh.

No thank youuu.\n  ","862746":"\n  In all scientific technicality, yeah; happiness is something sparked by chemicals that cause that reaction. But that doesn't mean it can't be something we should all strive for. Achieving happiness is everything. It's good feeling, and it's good for you!

But do be aware: not every letter of the alphabet stacks neatly above the regular sized text! Some letters will dip below because they don't have a tiny unicode version.

I was going to Illinois to visit with my partner for a little while, and I was going by megabus. We were just dropped off on (what seemed to be) just some random road. And it was pouring rain. Everyone else seemed to know where they were going but I was lost. I was in a massive city with a bunch of luggage, all by myself.\n  \n  Eventually a woman comes up and asks for some money. She said she's trying to make her way to a woman's shelter to escape from an abusive situation. I gave her some money. I think she could tell I was new around because I looked a whole mess. She offered her spare jacket to me, and told me the ways I need to go to get to my destination.

I love what the horror genre has to offer for art, however! Things like standalone pieces, or comics and manga.\n  ","862821":"\n  YES OF COURSE! There's nothing better feeling or better tasting than a cold bottle of water in the summer heat. Water always gets looked down on for being flavorless and boring. But you need it to thrive!

Dreams can show you your love, your fear, your wants, your hopes, your deepest feelings.. so when you see someone who has passed away in a dream, I think that your brain is just trying to give you another chance to see them. Or to visualize how loss truly makes you feel.\n  ","862833":"\n  My partner tells me that I could be a beauty blogger \/ vlogger because of the products that I use and the way I talk about them.

I'm worried about them, and I just want for them to be well.\n  ","862836":"\n  If I was able to name a star, I'd name it after my sweetheart: Lars.

It's one that I more recently (within the last year) got into, and I've rewatched it 1\u00bd times! I enjoy it for the interesting spin on how animals with humanlike sentience behave in a world bound by instinct of predator and prey. The psychological elements intrigue me, and the characters interest me. Plus the animation style is unique!\n  \n  My ALL TIME favorite anime is Inuyasha, however. It was my first anime. I was a tiny, restless tot that woke up one time at 5am. I wanted to see what was on the TV, so I turned it on and went to Cartoon Network. That's when I discovered Adult Swim, Toonami, and an anime with a temperamental dog eared boy from the feudal Era who said \"bad words\" on TV. \ud83e\udd2d\n  ","862856":"\n  More than anything right now, I'm craving honey crisp apple juice.\n  ","862857":"\n  This is an art piece on one of the windows in the PHL airport!
