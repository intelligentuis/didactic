But I find one of the main important aspects in a relationship or friendship would be communication or compromise. Your significant other or friends should be able to know and understand what your going through or how you may feel\/ be affected etc. Without communication and understanding theres a lot of misunderstandings and conflict which can break trust\/ cause a breakup to happen.\n  \n  Sit down and talk to those people and tell them how you are feeling, make sure they understand or reassure you both got it and will work together to fix whatever issue it may be. Also if there's zero communication then it's mainly one person who is working hard to maintain those friendships and relationships which results in a lot of emotional days and hard feelings, which can just become a very toxic and negative place you're in so it's best to just let go of that person and move on.\n  ","889797":"\n  I have believed in god since I was little bc my parents grew up in the catholic church teachings and beliefs and growing up I kinda followed that path as well.

This is what life has been looking like. I haven\u2019t really been posting much lately cause I\u2019ve just been thinking a lot. I love the time around New Years because even though literally nothing is different, we\u2019re all still the same people with all the same problems, it feels good to have a whole year ahead of myself and to think about what it could be. I know this year was not what anyone expected and everyone\u2019s plans went into the trash so it might be hard to make any plans or think about how this year could be, but regardless of how crazy things get around us, there are still things that we can control. Our behaviors, mindsets, how we treat ourselves and those around us, our habits... It\u2019s easy to feel like there\u2019s no point in changing or growing when your future feels so uncertain, but actually the future is always uncertain. We\u2019re just more aware of that fact right now. I\u2019ve been thinking about how I view people and the world and how I can change that to a more positive view while still being realistic lol, dealing with some anxiety-inducing mindsets that I\u2019ve gotten so used to experiencing but am realizing they\u2019re actually something I can change, thinking about how I want relationships with family and friends to be better and what type of conversations I need to have or effort I need to put in to do that, thinking about what effect I have had on the world and what effect God wants me to have on the world and how I can better serve Him in the work that I do, thinking about the lifestyle I live and how I want to have a healthier more organized one while still having time to relax and have balance in my life. I encourage you to think about these things for yourself and how you can grow this year regardless of how things go. If we want to make a better world, that starts with each individual person doing and being their best. \u2764\ufe0f\n  ","889997":"\n  What are you even talking about?\n  ","889998":"\n  Mhm\n  ","889999":"\n  No, as long as the soil is moist you should be fine\n  ","890000":"\n  Water polo.

The door IS and WILL always be open to her if she ever decides she wants to come back.\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/wS0iCuUdy9k\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","890162":"\n  Mhm\n  ","890163":"\n  Yeah but Netflix always has things removed\n  ","890164":"\n  Thanks\n  ","890165":"\n  Awe\n  ","890166":"\n  I wonder why\n  ","890167":"\n  No she doesn't have an ask account and those who are claiming they're her are most likely fake.

Thanks for being here and being a friend to me when I need it\n  ","890365":"\n  Also I always hated when people talk about my relationships, this is why I choose to keep most of those private. You don't know who i have dated or not dated or who i talk to and so on. So it's sort of annoying when you try to say oh shes not with that person etc. Look how many months it took everyone to realize i was back with christian after three years apart? So don't even start with oh shes not with so and so... you don't know them to even confirm that. But since y'all like to be in my buisness no I'm not with mikey anymore, but I am talking to someone amd seeing them. No I will not release a name because once again it's no ones concern but mine.\n  ","890366":"\n  And you're going around making up false allegations, playing the victim card when you've my dear friend have done way worse then I could have possibly done. It's sad you go around trying to make yourself look innocent and sweet when you're the one who should be penalized and know they're guilty. It's sad you only want attention and do these things just for a quick 2 second of fame and so on. It's sad that I use this app just to have fun and associate with certain people and it has become one of the worse things I've decided to do thanks to you. Do you not realize people dont always have to explain themselves to you? Or do you not realize that people deal with things u have no idea of? You invaded peoples privacy, put peoples safety in jeopardy and so on. And in a way I guess that's the price I pay for growing up in the spotlight since I was 8 years old. I've had rumors thrown at me. I'm used to it, I've been compared to others, ranked the least favorite. Been hated on... this is nothing new to me. Nothing is even original coming from u anyhow. I've been rumored to have dated people I never once spoke a word to and so on so I'm not letting you get the best of me. And i dont owe you anything either not even an explanation\n  ","890367":"\n  I don't really know what the point of writing this is going to be or why I'm even writing this to begin with... but for those who got the messages about me leaving temporary because of a situation feel free to read this if you want to. But the current situation:\n  \n  This situation has been going on for months now that I'm sure it has been going on for a year now already. Usually I'm pretty good at shrugging things off and moving onto more important things and focusing on those. But like any human there are days when things just get to you after so much and start to bother you. First it was the constant anonymous hate from various accounts that were ran by someone named allycia. This person has tried to lie, manipulate, and steal the identity of many other influencers and their friends and family. I have called that person out various times because well she used to fake me. Dani and my family and friends and so on and may still do it on other social media. She would make up false information and treat fans horribly going as far as cussing and so on when none of us would ever treat our fans that way. She also has attempted to put many relationships with family and so on in a toxic place and made those people believe her.\n  \n  But moving onto the more recent drama in life. .. those who continue to make new accounts under various names every day just to harass me, send hate, threats etc.\n  \n  What's the reason as to doing this? What's the reason you waste your life trying to tear others down and try to make yourself look like the better person? What's the point in editing messages and screenshotting, using photoshopped amd so on to make things seem realistic and for you to use as so called \"proof\". For starters I shouldn't have to always explain myself to others. I know who I am and what I do. Have i caused any actual harm to anyone? Not that I noticed but if I did I apologize. But if you actually have some sort of truth into the things you fake.... have you ever told what you said? Have you have told them why I may have said those so called horrible things to you? Did you ever tell those people how you would create a new account and talk badly about Amy's appearance and that? Knowing that someone who has a rare disease cant control certain things especially the way their body is shaped, or their height? Or did you ever show the side where you called her a name and talked sexually about her as well? How about the part where you threatened us, or \"Cimorelli members\" if you'll like me to phrase it that way for you. How you threatened to come to our house and k.ill us and so on? Also the fact that you tried to play around and joke about a serious topic such as s.uicide and being a victim of sexual abuse. Did you mention how I reached out to you and tried to help only for you to turn around and send explicit photos of males to me ? Then got mad bc i blocked you and tried to cry wolf and make up a false story to gain attention? People dont know the full story\n  ","890368":"\n  One second I'm going to write a post explaining things and that...\n  ","890369":"\n  I'll message u in a few mins\n  ","890370":"\n  Taylor swift\n  ","890371":"\n  I was suppose to do something earlier but completely forgot to\n  ","890372":"\n  I'm alright, how about you?
