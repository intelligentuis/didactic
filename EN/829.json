. only christina was married . christina is also the only one who has been pregnant is pregnant with her second child a rainbow baby . then continued to also curse and say things that we knew lisa would never say bc lisa tries to restrict curse words and doesnt really like them so she replaces them with other things like frick , rip , sharknado etc . then when we tried to confront george he blocked us and still continued to lie to people and had certain people who actually believed them . because the girl threatened him and so on so he went along with the lie . and then they would constantly harass her ok very being fake or create hate exposing pages to report her account and so on . . . so she just tries to stay away now","767730":"yes , we actually were the opening act for
