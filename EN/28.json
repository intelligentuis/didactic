if you re not even going to give it back right ? learn your wording before saying something . especially if they do it over and over again very soon together . almost every week asking for , , , and not returning it at all . that money adds up . they re using you at that point . that is a red flag and is not normal in a proper friendship . when someone keeps asking to borrow your car and they bring it back in horrible condition no gas trash everywhere and sometimes even have it wrecked . . . and they don t offer to clean it put gas in it give you money or even fix it . this is showing that

anything after . let it sit . after you gargle it do not put any water in your mouth at all . you can wipe your mouth . just look at the dentist don t put any water in your mouth . let it sit in your mouth and your throat . what the hydrogen peroxide does is it attacks the acids that are in your throat that are causing you a sore throat and if you actually do this right away when you start realizing you have a sore throat it can actually make it go away faster because you re handling the acids before they make you have a severe sore throat . it creates a scab in the back of your throat that s why you don t want to continuously do it too much because then you will irritate the throat . just like if you were to cut your leg you want a scab if you keep messing with the scab and putting alcohol on it you will just irritated . that s why i said don t exceed more than three times a day . this is what i was told also when i was doing it . and honestly if you have a sore throat you really honestly only have to do this for days the gargling . it should go away after that . it s just start showing change . if it doesn t help then that means you were too late when you started gargling and or it might be something different other than a sore throat . again good luck","26398":"continuation if your throat is severely hurting . get you some mint mouthwash . take two oz and pour it into a cup . then get you some hydrogen peroxide and then pour about oz into the same cup mix it up real well make sure that the liquids or warm if you have to get you some really warm water and add oz of that as well before adding the hydrogen peroxide and the mouthwash . you want the liquid to be warm it will really make your throat feel good . take you some salt and shake it into the cup then gargle it three times . i would only do this if you are a certain age because you do not need to swallow it . do not swallow hydrogen peroxide but if you read the bottle you can gargle it and it will help with sore throat . you do this about twice a day . after you wake up in the morning if your throat is hurting do it once . only do it after you eat . brush your teeth first and then do your everyday mouth washing but just add these ingredients also . before bed i would do it again . i would not exceed more than times a day doing it because it can actually worsen it if you keep doing it . but you just do it once or twice this is really good for sore throat . i personally do this and it works every time . good luck with your sore throat and i hope that you feel better good luck with your cold . now i am no doctor but these are just the things that i have used to help me get rid of a cold a sore throat or just a lot of mucus . i would honestly consult with your doctor before actually but it s up to you to take these ideas","26399":"depending on personal medical conditions . usually taking tylenol or some type of fever reducer and pain reducer helps . helps with some of the symptoms . it helps with reducing . taking some sort of a syrup for colds help . make sure you look into what you are taking and make sure it s okay to take with tylenol or pain reliever tablets . also make sure the stirrup you are allowed to take also . just in case you have any type of medical conditions such as high blood pressure . sometimes out of water such as alka seltzer can help . again make sure you can handle and take that before taking . warm liquid . theraflu is really good . sleep and rest and taking it easy . for at least the amount of the fever lasting . . you need to let your body focused on getting better . you moving around is not letting your body focus . your body is focused on moving more than getting better . lots of liquids . stay hydrated . more than usual . warm moist air . take warn min . showers a day . even though your body may be seem cold it s freaking out . stay comfortably warm . the mist from the shower will help you . even if you cough that means it s helping . promise . a dr . would say the same . salt water gargling depending on your symptoms of your cold of course . and then honestly if you have a cold i would recommend going to the doctor and getting prescribed medication to help you get better from being sick . this is the best way to cure a cold . prescribed medications . you can also get over the counter but all it s going to do is lessen the symptoms . also drinking vitamin c can help you get better . change your clothes frequently throughout the day and wash your face a lot . brush your teeth normally as you should . wash face at least times . if your throat hurts try warm tea a little bit of lemon and honey . depending on your age adding a little bit of bourbon to your drink can also help . if your throat is severely hurting . this question will continue on to another . . .","26400":"work and chill and get ready to go to louisiana .","26401":"it s no problem at all . i don t find a reason in trying to lie

think it s so funny how some of the people , trolls whatever on here are so interested in wondering what i eat on a daily basis ? and i guess what i look like maybe ? or how tall or short . i can tell you right now i have all the confidence in the world in myself . and that i have a wonderful look to my body . and that i have a lovely husband that thinks i am wonderfully beautiful . and he makes me feel beautiful every single day of my life . he s always made me feel this way . always will . i don t need anyone else s approval on the way i look other than myself . i m healthy . i feel and look healthy . i ain t no stick and i m not some giant fukn hippo ? ? but . . and even if i was either one of these why does it matter ? it s me it s not you . xd lol . it s my business and what i have to do the next day . me and what i have to deal with . i just think it s funny that people have nothing else better to do than to come on the internet and interrogate people to figure out those types of things and then make fun of them regardless if they re the right weight or not . if they re too skinny , you re still going to make fun of them if they re too big , you re still going to make fun of them if they re just right , you . are . still . going to make fun of them . . . because you have nothing else better to do than to come on here and make fun of people . ? sh ya might as well just bring yourself because you re going to be one of those categories too ! xd hilarious . everyone has taste and everyone has preference in what kind of person they want . and what size . tall . skinny . big . curvy . ? i just never understood it . hahaha . get a life . hahaha .","26515":"thank you so much ! ?","26516":"be real with you today it was at least a hundred degrees outside . it was very hot

. i have personal space . and i don t really understand why it s so hard to read that when i keep pulling away from you . really frustrating . i just wish people would respect . self respect and have respect for other people . and they re things . and their property . and just in general . and most importantly their personal space needs to be respected ! has your mom never taught you them that ? every parent teach a child how to give people space . idk . it s whatever . especially in today s society . we are living in covid ages . a pandemic . we shouldn t be doing a lot of touching of one another especially if we don t know each other and where we ve been . and the best thing about it is a lot of people think i m being harsh , but would you honestly be okay with a stranger and them just be able to come up to you and just start touching you and hugging you and grabbing your arms and your hair and touching your body and stuff and just coming straight at you ? getting all up in your face and just . yeah . . . . no , you wouldn t like that and if you do that is just strange on so many levels . and see me ? the minute i get physical or start telling them something . . . oh . . . well now i m the bad kid . the bad guy . but if they were to say it . it would be okay . i probably am a little harsh about things . but i mean you know better . and if you don t know better than

friends and people around town coming together to start a parade for the kids and the kids get all kinds of toys and beads and candy and we cook and we just socialize and have fun . play sports play games talk about the old days . swim all kinds of things . and then of course you do have your new orleans parades that can get a little rowdy usually . i guess i ve been to mardi gras parade before .

. and sometimes you don t have it when they want it . bad things can happen to you . especially if they know certain people . people can flip over just . . . i have heard of people robbing people for just that much . . it s crazy . . sad . i don t borrow money from people period . and if i do i return it within a day or a week which honestly it s only a few dollars . and i still don t like to even borrow that . it to me just makes me feel a lack of independency in myself . . . ya know ? i always like to have my money right . if i have to sacrifice something then i will to make sure i have enough money for my bills and myself . i paid for the needs first and then the wants come second . i remember oh what do i have to pay this month ? water bill this that this that . oh i need deodorant . i need that so i m going to get that . i don t need a new pair of shoes if i already have a pair or two or even three . that clearly can wait . the needs are what you have to get . i make sure that i m taking care of before asking for money . and if i have something i can sell to get money to be able to fix it then i will do that before even asking someone for money .","26557":"i m not exactly really ignoring them it s just because i m doing things at once or i m with a customer and i can t answer it in front of a customer . i would get in a lot of trouble for that . while i m on the job i m not even supposed to have my phone but they allow me to have it . so i m going to respect them and not use it while i m with a customer . but usually right after i m done with the customer i check my messages . but i always answer friends and family . always . if it s a random stranger or advertisement or spam message sometimes i ignore them . even strangers are usually immediately message back . depending on who they are . i did a lot of messages . especially a lot of stranger messages . i have to be really careful because some of them are really strange people . some of them asking me really sexual nasty vulgar questions . some of them asking me just disturbing things . and some of them trying to scam me and more . that s why a lot of the times i only answer your family and friends . but this is only just because i get literally a ton of messages . sometimes it s hard to get to all of them there so many . can get frustrating at times .","26558":"well today in general i woke up got ready for the day worked most of the day came home but right before i came home . lunch with my husband came home talked with him watch tv and cuddled with him for a few hours and then i got his lunch ready and now i m just chilling . thinking about what i am gonna have for dinner tonight . idk yet . maybe some spaghettios . not sure yet .","26559":"literally just as i was sending this to you and talkin about memory issues i had someone call me and i forgot to give them something lol literally everyone has a flaw and makes mistakes . i admit to it . i think it s slightly frustrating but funny at the same time but at least i try right ? i explain that to them and they already knew and they said it s okay . i do it all the time it s not like i m not going to see them tomorrow . it s not more or less more of a procrastinating type thing i m literally forgetting on accident . i literally do hundreds of things per day and have thousands of thoughts going through my mind . making the list is out of the question . i would probably have a book .","26560":"using . someone using . and then . slightly attention seeking . but this is just my personal opinion because i ve had this happen to me before but not exactly a relationship just a person . and that s what i referred them to someone using you and then someone that s slightly attention seeking . basically they like the attention that you give them . you make them feel loved . that s the sight in a relationship more than a friendship . but mine was more of a friendship but again i take them as a using attention seeking type person . i never really got stuck in these situations too much because the minute they started doing it i usually cut them off because i m not gonna be their bank . i work hard for the things that i get in life and i work hard for my money . and i m not about to sit there and just hands just someone that didn t do anything for it . that should be the thought that you think of . you re not a bank . you re not anyone s bank . and sometimes the person that s giving them the money doesn t see that . but honestly if anyone regardless of their quote on quote feelings for you . if they re literally just getting money from you and leaving that s what they re doing . they re using you . sometimes you just have to have someone on the outside to tell you that .","26561":"so far it looks like i m probably going to work cook and chill because i have to work and usually after work i m really tired i ll probably do some cleaning and gaming but other than those things i don t know . i know i have

jealousy isn t a good thing . jealousy he can break up friendships , relationships and even make family members break apart . jealousy is not really isn t good . i mean of course everyone is going to be somewhat jealous and but that s okay . but when you re going to be an obsessed person and just envy people all the time and everyone around you and constantly just be angry at them because they re successful over because they worked for that . . . that s not good . an ex . of little jealously . okay jealously . being like . . . i wish i had her hair or thise shoes . . or i wish that i could sing or jump or run like that . that s different but when you goes to the extent of being angry and cutting her hair off or tripping her while she s running . or taking her things just because you can t have it so you think she can t have it . . . then that s when jealousy is taken too far . not saying you re that jealous , no i m just saying jealousy can hurt in ways depending . . . like it and your character . . reputation . . i know a lot of people say i don t care what people think of you but do you honestly want people to think that you re selfish ? and lazy ? it won t amount to nothing . then fine . but watch how you anyone are being jealous . or really honestly just be yourself and be happy with what you are . try and stay determined and be passionate . have self esteem and
