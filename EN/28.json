Even though the money left the card and said that we paid for the stuff. That infuriated me because we actually needed food in the house and they would not let us get it.\n  \n  So now every time I come in it seems like they remember us and want to be rude to us still even though THEIR machines messed up.\n  \n  That wasn't the first time that has happened to me. One time they charged $300 to my card when I was trying to buy one belt that costed maybe 10 $15 dollars... and then I had to sit around for almost an hour trying to give my money back and they gave ot back to me in cash and I was actually on vacation out of town. Absolutely ridiculous. And then they want to treat me bad after they messed up? It just doesn't make any sense. This was Walmart by the way. They always seem to mess everything up.

Idk but all I can say is I reeally dought that I am gonna steal a 8 dollar Play-Doh set... People just think they can do whatever they want and thibk it's necessary. It really made me mad tbh. My conscience is way too much. I would feel like sh until I returned it or paid for it. So I couldn't steal. My conscience would eat me alive. And no. They didn't apologize. They think they are the best for being like that. A shame. Should be ashamed of themselves and go actually worry about people that are really causing problems.\n  ","30081":"\n  I don't.

They were trying to joke around and make it seem like they were going to hit me and they accidentally did. But it still doesn't make any sense. You could literally be doing absolutely nothing wrong to somebody and get attacked the only reason why I didn't do anything back to them is because I thought they were crazy for randomly attacking so I was thought to myself get away from them because maybe they're insane and they just might not have anything to live for. There are certain people you just do not react to and you get away from. It was a guy and in that instance I just wanted to get away from him because I was totally caught off guard.

I remember driving an hour to two hours away and sometimes getting car sick but we would get to this place where we had pretty much a family reunions and we'd have all of these pies and there was just so much food I remember, but we would have so much fun and there was a playground and everything and I got to play with so many kids. At the end of the day I had a really good time. I'm just mentioning all this because I remember the old days I miss them.

You can keep your doors open as long as it's not too cold and it can keep the house cool without having to turn the air conditioning or the heater on. You can conserve more electricity that way.

Especially if they feel comfortable in their own body. And they feel happy and confident. No need to say anything to them at all.  Leave them be. I understand if someone smells a little strange or maybe their hair is a brushed just right or something.. or maybe they're wearing a dress that's a bit too short in your opinion... or maybe it's a guy wearing tight jeans... To be honest.. it's better just to mind your own business and keep your mouth shut. Let people do them. Because at the end of the day that's them doing them and it's not affecting you.\n  \n  But say for instance there's nothing wrong with a girl and she's just sitting there and you just think that maybe her feet are a little too big. So you take it upon yourself to go up to her and tell her that. Just keep your words to yourself that is totally uncalled for and to be honest her feet probably aren't even that big to other person. Just to you it might be. Shallowness is definitely a thing. You need to look at a person from the inside. Not more from the outside because to be honest you could fall for someone that's totally beautiful but they have a horrible attitude. I would not want to be with someone that has a bad attitude regardless of how fine they look. I want someone that actually wants a future. Someone that has confidence is extremely determined and is ambitious and have a wonderful future that they wish ahead of them. That is a wonderful person.

Tells you about the different ways that they filter water where it's from and what's in it and what they do with it and sometimes what measures they go to get it. And more. Water dirty at first and goes through a cycle continuously. The same cycle. It has to be cleaned for you to be able to drink obviously or you're just drinking bacteria water and pee water. And just nastiness. Some water is less clean that other water and some water has minerals in it some water goes through different types of chemicals some water is just straight purified some Waters from aquifers groundwater\n  \n  They have water with salt in it which honestly isn't the greatest for people that have high blood pressure and can just cause you to be more thirsty and defeat the purpose. Water such as Dasani and Aquafina. If you read the back of the bottles they will soon as they contain salt. Doctors will not recommend that water to people that have high blood pressure issues. For it is not good for them.\n  \n  I also don't like Crystal Geyser water because it tastes like they put some sort of chlorine in it and it's really gross. Sometimes Nestle water can be nasty too because I think it comes in batches or something maybe? Wherever they get the water I don't know. Also you can't leave bottled water warm too long or the oils condensed into the bottle and can cause cancers. Be careful with your bottled water. Because it does matter. It can affect your health.

So you are more than welcome to ask.\n  \n  2. Geography because I like researching that and I really wanted to go to school for it. A ton of money goes into going to school for that it can be even almost up to $100,000 sometimes and it is like seven to nine years of schooling.

Ex: Aye.. let me borrow $20, when you say *borrow* that means you're going to give them back the $20 and it advance, later on. When you never give it back that's kind of a red flag because why would you use the word borrow if you're not even going to give it back right? Learn your wording before saying something. Especially if they do it over and over again very soon together. Almost every week asking for $5,$15,$20,$30 and not returning it at all. That money adds up. They're using you at that point.

But be aware that you have to follow the VIP plus activity tasks for the week or they take it away. Every week they have tasks that you must complete.\n  \n  You can find this tab on the left side of your screen on your mobile phone or it is close to your settings tab on your computer.\n  \n  You have until the date that it says last to complete at least the minimal number that it asked for in the weekly tasks for the VIP program.\n  \n  But yeah, you were added to VIP like all of us has because you are being really active on here and you qualified for it. That's why you got the VIP badge which is really good. Stay active!\n  \n  If you stay in the VIP program. Ask.fm will honor you for it if you stay in it and stay loyal.\n  \n  I have been a part of the VIP program since it started or at least for as long as I can remember. Consecutively I have done it for months and months and months and months.. and month's.. Completing each week's tasks stacking up in the months. Ask.fm has tagged me on their page and is now rewarding me with a gift. I feel honored to get this. You can do it too. Just stay loyal. Stay active.

One time I answered it an anonymous person decided to come forth and of course not show themselves lol and decide to try to tell me that I could never do that. They don't know me and I've already done it before. I'm a 90s kid. Phones were not that important. Phones were expensive and only used to communicate with people. We didn't really have text message and computers were expensive and internet was insanely expensive especially on phones. I grew up as a tomboy playing with the neighborhood kids. The only time we came in and play with electronics was when we came in and played with the electronics with no internet. We played offline and we played with tons of kids socializing and having fun. Not playing by ourselves in our room screaming and television 24\/7 everyday of Our Lives. I do play video games sometimes by myself but I still play them with groups of people and have a good time and socialize. And I don't take the game too seriously. At the end of the day it's just a game. It's not real.\n  \n  My point is I think it's funny that random people that don't even know me and the age that I come from and what I grew up through already. It just goes to show that strangers know nothing about you and have no room to talk. And anything and everything they say doesn't affect mem\n  ","31077":"\n  No one???????\n  ","31078":"\n  I wouldn't exactly use the word hate.\n  \n  But I wouldn't want to be in a room with someone I disliked very much.

I live out here on the countryside and if you were to get lost out here at night you would be eating without a doubt unless you know how to hunt.\n  ","31083":"\n  Many things.

I don't think honestly any job is boring. I think every job has some sort of turn and excitement in it whether it even be something super small I think every job has something fun in it.

It's only up to you to make it.\n  ","31086":"\n  To have patience because if you don't have that then you don't have anything. You must have to learn to wait and be patient. Patience has to do with almost everything in life. A big one is relationships and friendships. You have to have patience to be able to have a healthy and stable friendship and then you have to have friendship and patience to be able to have a real relationship. Communication trust and loyalty is also important\n  ","31087":"\n  I guess you could say loud noises.

Why kids can't just not act like that\n  ","31091":"\n  Large Grande Size double-shot Java Chip mocha frappe. \ud83d\ude0b YUM\n  ","31092":"\n  This wouldn't happen. I don't usually lend money because it can lead to arguments if not paid back and stuff. If one of my close friends needed money. I would probably just give it to them without asking for it back. Of course it was a reasonable amount of money asked for. But honestly my friends wouldn't come to me and ask for money like that. I just don't have those kinds of friends that do that if you know what I mean.\n  ","31093":"\n  Oh nice.\n  ","31094":"\n  Thanks! \ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd18 Ikr?\n  ","31095":"\n  Yep. Rare.

Me and him hit it off immediately and became really good friends and eventually really started to like one another and then started to date. So we met online again unexpectedly and we're in a long distance relationship and we video chatted, talked to each other got to know one another. Just was always constantly communicating. Got to know eachother's families and everything and then soon we met together with a group a friends of mine. We traveled and met. And we had never seen each other before but literally acted like we always had. Me and him had talked every single day since the day we met online before we met in person after and obviously now LOL.

But at the end of the day it can\/is\/may be sensitive to you, that's when friends come in. You always have them to go to invent to them. Even if it means your own family.
