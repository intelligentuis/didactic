You're probably gonna regret letting me tho bc my best advice is to not mess around with notes or flirting or anything, just talk to the person and try to get to know the person and if that's going well, trade off numbers. I would say you're more likely to get genuine messages from someone who feels like they know you and if they don't want to talk or trade numbers after knowing you better, the results gonna be the same if they don't know you, so there's nothing to lose either way, just more to gain by talking in person.\n  ","946643":"\n  I'm not a guy, but I'm gay.....would my opinion be valid?\n  ","946644":"\n  Pretty horrible in many different ways\n  ","946645":"\n  Not sure honestly.

You're saying if there was a long time gap in between when one person had sex with one person and another, would it be faithful bc they waited all that time in between, I think \ud83e\udd14. If that is what you're saying, yeah, I think that could be called being faithful\n  ","946757":"\n  I'm still confused haha. If the other \"waited and slept\", doesn't that mean they didn't wait bc they slept with someone? And are these hypothetical people married to each other? Who was the other person pretending to sleep with?\n  ","946758":"\n  Are you talking about like an open relationship? Or being cheated on? Sorry I don't get the question \ud83d\ude05\n  ","946759":"\n  Well it depends on what they mean by waited bc if they are saying waited for sex, then they are lying. I think sex is more about lust\n  ","946760":"\n  I don't know but I'm not a big eater so it probably doesn't apply to me\n  ","946761":"\n  No\n  ","946762":"\n  Holding hands is pretty common too.

I'm just not ready for it \ud83d\ude2c\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  Yeah I did see a doctor afterward and thanks. Anyway, we really should meet, that would be fun!\n  \n  I'm really tired now (from doing absolutely nothing all day \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude05) so imma knock out for the night. Goodnight!\n  ","946782":"\n  The UW. You?  And yeah about the timed tests. They are just another layer of stress and are pointless bc school is supposed to be about learning. Why should it matter how fast we learn something or how fast we can do it after we just learned it? If we eventually understand it, that's what should matter (and if we don't, the teacher prob sucks). I've been pretty anxious about starting school again. Idek know when it's starts tbh. I think Sept. 25 but I haven't bothered checking haah. I had my first severe anxiety attack a couple weeks ago and had to go to the ER, like I feel like that should be a sign that something isn't right about the stress level of college students these days....\n  ","946783":"\n  Controlling; thinking they are superior\n  ","946784":"\n  Zendaya bc she's awesome in every way. I feel like all I need to do is say her name and I've explained enough \ud83d\ude02. Everyone loves her and if they don't, they have personal issues \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Aight that was harsh....but I really like her haha.\n  ","946785":"\n  Computer science. The subject is a big interest to me, I've been into it for a while now, but the CS classes and program requirements at my school are difficult and the major is super competitive so it's hasn't been very fun lately... Plus I'm not a very good timed test taker. I wish I could take the quarter off, but my housing had already been paid for and it costs money to withdraw it \ud83d\ude11\n  ","946786":"\n  We really do haha. I'm down to meet fr though. Sociology is what my brother is studying. Sounds like we're in the same boat though for how school is going for us \ud83d\ude10. Have you started school already for the fall term yet?\n  ","946787":"\n  Same tbh. When I came home for summer I said I didn't want to go back. My friend and I were talking possibly dropping out and doing a project together, but I can tell that's not what my family wants me to do and they have a point that I will most likely be more successful with a degree. It's just been very stressing. Last yr was my freshman yr and it didn't go so well \ud83d\ude2c. What are you studying?\n  ","946788":"\n  I do work and school too. I only work part-time though bc school completely drains me \ud83d\ude23. My interests are mainly listening to music, sleeping, writing, drumming, computer coding, making people laugh and dancing :D\n  ","946789":"\n  Anxiety and depression\n  ","946790":"\n  Because they don't get paid enough for the boring crap they have to do and bc of that, people are tired and angry and then become disrespectful to each other, only spreading more angriness and more hate.\n  \n  That's just one instance. But ofc it varies. Some people hate their jobs bc their bosses are discriminative, some people hate them bc the people they serve are rude, some people hate them bc they work in crappy conditions, some people hate them bc they are extremely exhausting....it all depends.\n  ","946791":"\n  China I think.....?\n  ","946792":"\n  So what do you do? What are your interests? Do you work full-time, go to school?\n  ","946793":"\n  I don't. I just sink deeper and deeper\n  ","946794":"\n  No time of day\n  ","946795":"\n  Yes true. I might go back in December for few days so weather should be a lot better :D. And it's cause my family is complicated \ud83d\ude10... Did you grow up here in Seattle?\n  ","946796":"\n  It was great bc it's where my mom lives and all her kids (my siblings) and I got to see them all for the first time in a long time and got to meet nieces and nephews I hadn't met before. I wish I could go back just to be with all of them. But I didn't really get to explore much or anything bc of the heat. We had to stay inside pretty much all the time. We went to a park at one point, but didn't stay for that long\n  ","946797":"\n  Yeah I suppose so. Although honestly I wouldn't mind if the power went out for a bit. Plus it was nighttime anyway \ud83d\ude02. And yeah, it's nice to have the 60\/low 70s degree weather back. I went to Texas at one point this summer and it was like 100 degrees there but it actually wasn't as bad as here bc they have air conditioning in their houses. In Seattle summertime I'm always having to sit right next to fan and if I move anywhere else I'm sweating \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n  ","946798":"\n  ikr haha. Yeah, but it came back on like immediately afterwards.\n  ","946799":"\n  Geez, I live in Seattle too \ud83d\ude31. Yeah it was. I like the rain so I was happy to have it back after all the 80 degree weather. The power went out for like 5 seconds where I live \ud83d\ude02\n  ","946800":"\n  Whaaat?

I really wish I could love myself. But I can't. I hate myself and I hate being me and idk how to change that myself. I feel stuck; trapped; helpless; hopeless. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is bc of Zendaya. She's my idol and I love her to death (literally) and I want to watch her new movie and show before I die. So hopefully I can be patient enough until mid-August.\n  ","947210":"\n  I want to stop caring about what others think but I can't help it. That's a lot of what triggers my anxiety. Idk how to stop. And I feel like I can't love myself if no one else does. Why should I? If I'm not good enough for anyone else then why should I be good enough for myself? It's other people's words and actions that make us feel loved and belonging not our own. Only other people can validate us bc if no one likes us but ourselves, we won't get anywhere. I wish I could enjoy my life but I can't bc I feel all these things and I can't help it. I've lost all hope bc whenever I would feel hopeful, life smacked reality into my face and set me 10x farther down into my hole then I already was. Being hopeful leads to too much pain bc I will always get hurt. Nothing ever goes right. So now I'm just waiting to be freed from this terrible world and all this pain, loneliness and sadness.\n  ","947211":"\n  I like being myself and I need that dedicated time to myself. But I also need friends and someone to trust and talk to. So sometimes I'm ok by myself and other times it's horrible. I want to have the option. But I typically don't take myself out. Maybe I should try. I always feel like people are gonna judge me if them see me, especially people I know. And also when I'm out it's hard seeing people out together laughing and messing around and eating together etc bc I really wish I could have that\n  ","947212":"\n  I wish I could do I what would make me happy. I wish I could do that on the world. That's the dream ofc. But life is not like that for me. I try not to be alone but it's not that simple. Not everyone can just exist and then make friends easy. I've tried so hard. I joined clubs, I've pushed myself, I've met people, but in the end they leave me. Everyone else has other friends and don't need me so they don't care. I join things but then I feel left out and they make me feel alone. Other people join with friends so they have someone and then no one talks wants to talk me bc they don't know me. I auditioned for the school drumline but I probably won't even make it in. Life is always like that for me. And even if I did, it turns out I have a scheduling conflict that I may not be able to fix. I tried joining the BSU and went to meetings for over a month, but always felt so isolated and different whenever I was there so I quit. I tried volunteering at a CS class but then there was a scheduling conflict and I had to stop.....I could go on. The point is we can't control our own lives. People tell us that and they think it's true but it's not. Some people just get to be happy while other's either can't be or have to lower their expectations so excessively to the point where being lonely makes you happy.\n  ","947213":"\n  So I hate being here. And no, you probably can't help. Idk how you could. I've tried to get help, I've pushed myself, I've tried to be what people wanted me to be, I've tried to be what I want to be, but it's just unachievable. So now I just cry and take drugs until hopefully someday I die.\n  ","947214":"\n  So many reasons that would is way too long for an Ask answer to explain. But I'll say a bit.\n  \n  1. Some people get to be \"blessed\" or \"more blessed\" while others have to suffer and barely get by.\n  \n  2. Some people are born fitting the mythic norm while others don't and are therefore subject to more discrimination, hate, bullying, depression, isolation, feeling unloved by society, etc.\n  \n  3. You can't be \"whatever you want\" or \"whatever you put your mind to\" when you grow up. People tell you that when you're children but the truth is in most of those cases you need to have *a lot* of money and\/or be ridiculously smart. Not everyone is like that. Some people take time to learn things, some people have disabilities, some parents don't have great jobs, sometimes life accidents happen that can destroy your future, sometimes people make mistakes they didn't mean to, sometimes people study\/work really hard and try their best but they still can't achieve it\u2026..30% of people at most who apply at my University get into the CS program. That's crushing 70% of people's dreams.\n  \n  4. There's a lot of pressure, especially on young people to do everything right and be the best and accomplish all these achievements.\n  \n  5. Introverts are less likely to get into programs, schools, jobs, pretty much anything they apply for even though they are not any less capable than extroverts. Being a quiet person is not a defect.\n  \n  6. Some people have so much hate in them and don't care about dragging others down and destroying them with their words.\n  \n  7. Discrimination, police brutality, racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, gun violence, massacres\u2026.I don't think that needs explanation.\n  \n  Okay that was a lot and that's just scratching the surface. But point is, I hate life and I want to die. I'm tired of living in this cruel and unforgiving world. I don't get blessed and I never feel happy. I constantly feel lonely, anxious, worried, tired, alone, hurt, not good enough, ugly and most of all, sad.\n  ","947215":"\n  I'm on Summer but not particularly enjoying it. I'm kind of stressed out from an incident two days ago and I'm nervous about a few things and I don't get much of a break before I have to start working. So yeah, summer kind of sucks.

Idk why, I never watch that guy\n  ","947314":"\n  \ud83d\udcaf\n  ","947315":"\n  I think that's your decision\n  ","947316":"\n  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n  ","947317":"\n  I'm not one of them\n  ","947318":"\n  Nope\n  ","947319":"\n  I hate it\n  ","947320":"\n  jr_moo\n  ","947321":"\n  Alright, but that's only because I've stayed in all day and did whatever I want\n  ","947322":"\n  A dress\n  ","947323":"\n  In my bed in my residence hall\n  ","947324":"\n  Maybe when you just can't stop thinking about someone\n  ","947325":"\n  No I haven't surprisingly\n  ","947326":"\n  I have, but not to impress my friends, just myself \ud83d\ude02\n  ","947327":"\n  Just getting ready for class, hbu?\n  ","947328":"\n  Thank you \u2764\ufe0f\n  ","947329":"\n  Indifferent\n  ","947330":"\n  I'm tired, anxious and stressed. Thanks for asking though, how are you?\n  ","947331":"\n  I already am.\n  ","947332":"\n  Good!\n  ","947333":"\n  Half of what you said was incomprehensible, but if God created me that means God wanted me to be gay. If God didn't want that, God would not have created me or anyone else to be gay. Now we back to the start again smh.\n  \n  You're finally leaving? Good!\n  ","947334":"\n  I never asked you to \"push me in the right way,\" in fact, I already asked you to stop. You're not gonna change my mind or anyone's about who they love. No one can do that bc who you love can't be controlled. So if that was your goal, then you're wasting your time, not just with me, but anyone who you try to force your religious beliefs onto. No one needs or wants to hear your homophobic point of view.\n  \n  I'm just calling your God how they are. Or at least how you're describing them. If anyone oppresses people, especially on purpose, they are an ass. Even God.\n  ","947335":"\n  Dark, you?\n  ","947336":"\n  Sure\n  ","947337":"\n  Read this clearly. We already covered that love is a feeling and feelings are not choices. People don't decide to disobey God and be gay. They are born gay and it's not their choice or their doing. *No one chooses who they fall in love with or who they are attracted to.* That is on God and how God created them. So yes, God is punishing them for God's own actions. God is punishing them for how God themselves created them. That makes your version of God an unfavorable ass.\n  ","947338":"\n  *what you think is the wrong path\n  ","947339":"\n  Eh...idc. Either or neither\n  ","947340":"\n  My old drumline director\n  ","947341":"\n  Honestly don't think there's anything more to talk about. It's just fact that there's no proof that God disproves of gay people (not anymore than other everyday actions most people do) and if God does, God is the one to blame bc God made them and is punishing them for something God themselves did, therefore making God a dick who no one should be proud of going to stay with during their afterlife. I definitely could never be.\n  \n  You have yet to prove any of this wrong and so I don't want to drag out this conversation if you're just gonna continue to excessively talk without actually being able to prove anything that I said incorrect or give legitimate reason to make anyone believe you without there being either an easy way to disprove it or going back to what I said above.\n  \n  You're just going in circles with no real backup, making unsupported guesses up as you go along and I have work to do so I don't have time to go in circles with unsupported theories.\n  ","947342":"\n  Sliced strawberries\n  ","947343":"\n  I'm not one of them so I can't really answer, but some of them who think they are hot probably do tbh\n  ","947344":"\n  Piano, guitar, drums\n  ","947345":"\n  Why?\n  ","947346":"\n  Christmas but barely and Thanksgiving. And sometimes New Years\n  ","947347":"\n  No, not annoyed, I agree with their choices\n  ","947348":"\n  Same answer I just gave below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe Check those dancers out if you haven't already\n  ","947349":"\n  I'm not crazy about Ayo and Teo. They stole several of Les Twins moves without giving them any credit and then called them \"snakes.\" It was immature and disrespectful, especially to someone who inspired and created so many of their moves. They also have been doing the same moves for years now with no signs of improvement. It's gotten boring.\n  \n  I would rather watch professional dancers like Kida The Great, Josh Price, Kaycee Rice, Gabe De Guzman, Fik-Shun, Les Twins, Poppin John, Lil Phoenix, Bgirl Logistx....the list goes on. You should check them out\n  ","947350":"\n  Acting like you're better than everyone else is cocky. I feel like confidence is when you believe in yourself. So I guess the difference is when you're confident it's more just thinking about yourself and what you can do and when you're cocky it's more about comparing yourself to others\n  ","947351":"\n  Yep, gimme yours and I'll message you with Messenger\n  ","947352":"\n  Which one?\n  ","947353":"\n  I don't wanna put my number online , can I give you my email for Google Hangouts or a social media handle?\n  ","947354":"\n  Do you have an Instagram or any easier\/more private way to communicate?\n  ","947355":"\n  19, you?\n  ","947356":"\n  Aww I feel you\n  ","947357":"\n  How old are you?\n  ","947358":"\n  Hmm Iron Man\n  ","947359":"\n  Just woke up.
