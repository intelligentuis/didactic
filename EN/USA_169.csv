  I feel we all change a bit in certain ways due to experiences or things in life happening to us that makes us want to do something such as be better or live a different lifestyle for a bit because we get tired of having a certain image or label.

   Is faith in God something that you feel? How would you describe the feeling as compared to an emotion?
  ","
  It's not something you really feel. It's more of a thought that you believe in. When things go wrong. If you're religious... you were kinda always told to trust god, let god deal with only he has the answer and we just need to pray etc. So when things aren't going that great that's why we kinda say ""I put my trust in god to make the right choice"" or something along that line.

   What's your cure for depression?🌻
  ","
  Theres really no actual cure bc it can always come back...
  
  But medication helps... even though some people are against medically controlled ideas by a drug
  
  Therapy or just talking about things bothering you in general with someone
  
  Maybe trying to think of one goal to do for the day can make you happy if you complete it
  
  Time definitely  helps.
  
  Meditation
  
  Focusing on something that takes your mind off what you're feeling..

  The crooked fingers. I had since I was little, it's a genetic thing that my dads family has that was passed on to 6/11 of us. While some have a more normal appearance  they either have a more longer, shorter finger. However mine is more unique bc I actually slammed it into a door when I was younger. Also I'm not aware if i actually have it yet or not but a bloodcotting disorder runs in our family from my mom's side which is what led to christina miscarrying her first child.... and my mom lost 5 pregnancies as well

  MY FIRST EP “Orange” IS COMING OUT ON JULY 26TH
  
  Featuring: Running, Flames, Pressure and A NEW SONG called Brown Eyed Boys 🧡
  
  I’ve been writing these songs since I was seventeen. They are the result of heartbreaks and anxiety and mistakes. They’re also the result of magic and excitement and of taking risks. They came from me sitting in my bedroom making something up on my laptop and wondering if it would be good enough to be a song. When I listen to all of these songs together, I get a distinct feeling. A feeling of nostalgia and excitement. A feeling of pain and disappointment. A bit of a bittersweet feeling. Sometimes I see feelings as colors, and this feeling is the color Orange. 🍊

  Don't  worry about being outgoing! You become less shy when you start being yourself, whatever that is. If you are a quiet person, that's  totally fine! Being shy is only a problem when it gets in the way of you saying things you want to say. It's ok to just be an observant  person and a good listener.  Don't  put pressure on yourself to be something  you're  not!

   Do you think the Cimorelli squeaky clean image has been tarnished. By Dani admitting to drinking, Smoking & smoking weed in the past while she was still in the band. Or is that the real reason she left because you didn't like her lifestyle.
  ","
  She didn't leave because we disliked her lifestyle. She left because she wanted to other things in life besides be a girl who was in a band with her sisters since she was 7 years old. Dani has always been more of a person who wanted to be multiple things in life and branch out from just being known that way. She was always the wild and adventurous  one. Everyone has their own values and beliefs and it doesnt make you more or less of a human being if you made mistakes or did something  that the world doesnt always agree with.

  Hi, dani here. Since lauren is way to kind and monitors what she says because she has younger audiences let me be the one to kindly say it. Anyone who is friends, family, etc of her exs or his family please kindly FUCK OFF. You're irrelevant  and I dont even know why you guys are finally crawling out of the woodwork like cockroaches. Leave her and our family alone. And stop trying to earn clout 《° Danielle Calleiro•》

  It's always talked about in my family. And if I could change a child or a few children's lives for the better and had an opportunity to do so and it felt right then definitely.  But I still feel like I'm way to young to have children at the moment.

   Did any of your friends have the “cool” parent when you were kids?

  Probably my siblings and I. My parents were strict but also very nice and loved having people over. They still do lol, and the Norton's because the boys did like dirt bike racing and all. But they ended up all moving and the parents split up... kallens mom is a wedding planner so it was cool to have Christina's wedding planned by her. And Lucy's parents treated me and dani like her own.

  "
907895,"
   Why doesn't Lisa like this site?
  ","
  Because this fake which I'm pretty sure was the girl who runs all the fake accounts of our family and so on. Was ruining her reputation  on here. She was faking being married to George Shelley  from union j which was a uk boy band. At this time lisa was in a private relationship  with her fiancee chad Gilbert from new found glory. They also stated lisa had kids and even names and so on and weights of these children she supposedly had. NONE OF MY SISTERS HAD KIDS AT  THE TIME. ONLY christina was married. Christina is also the only one who has been pregnant/ is pregnant  with her second child (a rainbow baby ). Then continued to also curse and say things that we knew lisa would never say bc lisa tries to restrict curse words and doesnt really like them so she replaces them with other things like ""frick, RIP, sharknado etc. Then when we tried to confront George he blocked us and still continued to lie to people and had certain people who actually believed them. Because the girl threatened him and so on so he went along with the lie. And then they would constantly harass her ok very being fake or create ""hate/exposing pages "" to report her account and so on. .. so she just tries to stay away now
  "
907896,"
   She met them? i've met Demi tho and she is so short lol
  ","
  Yes, we actually were the opening act for the jonas brothers. And then there was this event we went to called rocking on the rooftop or something like that. Were demi and nick was at as well. It was a pool party but lisa was the only one who wore her swimsuit lol
  
  And then Camila we ran into at the tcas

  I dont play bass or guitar... I'm still learning how to do so. 😊 that's more amy and kath and well dani knows as well. My brothers michael and christian play as well. Mike was in the band when we first started but now deals with all the tech related stuff for when we tour and that

   How you earn money

  I've been in a band for over ten years in my entire life. Our band was a YouTube  tube girl band that raised to fame. The daughter of a manger out in the UK discovered us and showed our videos to her mom which resulted in lisa getting an email about wanting to hear us perform. We drove down to la that day and got signed from 2010-2015 we worked with a music label by the name island records. In 2015 we wanted to give up music completely because the music industry was trying to turn us into an image we never wanted to be. So we broke away from the industry and went independent  and moved to nashville in may 25th to restart our lives and rebrand to who we actually were meant to be. And still go on that message we believe in.

  Sorry love but the same stuff happened before  with mikey and it's happening again. Tbh it's not a no brainers and I know who to believe.  Sonny doesn't eve. Look like himself hes tired and burnt out and saying its not true when there is literal proof there is. Sorry sonny but you cant have others talk his way out of it for him. And if that third party is mikey they're referring to I will go off. Ryan literally spewed the same thing he did on his livestream before. Tries to make the others look bad and himself innocent but you're not at all. We've all heard the spiel before and received massive hate for it I know who we believe. Ask the two members that left. We know the conditions of living in that house. Also on a more logic reasoning  here: why would the boys leave at 2 am for no reason? Why even plst that where they know everyone can see and can easily shut down all that? Yet ryan and the others wait ""hours to even try to clear it up""?

  People just dont get his personality or understand  that shes old enough to make the choices she always wanted to make but couldn't do.

  I'm sorry but I literally hate some fans of the boys right now. Pointing out that they shouldn't be going for walks or visiting with family while the corona is still around... explain to me where it said we couldn't go for walks or be with with family as long as it's under 10 people. Then to sit there and judge three of the boys for returning home or visiting g their grandparents... hello you dont understand  the reason why or what's going on behind the closed door. Sonny just had to bury his nan that's why he went home -.- my heart goes out to them right now

  Boon does a lot of the guitar parts in my production of songs... but like I said I might discuss this more deeper later when I break down the meaning or something. I also wanted to incorporate  certain like ""messages"" into a song as well
  "
908704,"
   Oh wow
  ","
  I also had to do the harmonies for most of the songs of SGC. I worked beside amy of girls like me which almost didnt make it out on the album bc she was doubting herself, dani asked me to do hers for galaxy bc she didnt have the confidence in her higher register at the time, and I also worked with christina and lisa on theres. So that may give u a hint as to who it may be or who it may not be.
  "
908705,"
   Good or bad emotions?
  ","
  All good but I will say this....
  
  IN ACID RAIN - dani has the first verse which is a song I wrote about a toxic relationship  which somehow gets pinned on christian but it happend to me twice and repeated lol
  
  IN BEFORE OCTOBERS GONE- its Dani's song but I have the first verse of that even though the song was about Jonah marais
  
  Then let's travel back to SGC ALBUM
  
  BLUE - my first solo song I ever actually put out into the world. Dani DID THE HARMONY
  
  IN GALAXY - her song i HAD TO DO THE HIGH HARMONY
  
  ATOM BOMB is A SIMILAR  SONG TO acid rain x flames. And I'm pretty sure that was the song she mentioned about it's been 2 years or something lol
  "
908706,"

  We were an atom bomb
  
  Eight days, eight nights spent trying to sort through the aftermath
  
  It'squiet,too quiet, thissilence sounds like a thunderclap
  
  And allI wanted was somebody to trust
  
  But all you wanted was somebody to want you
  
  In this toxic love we're chemicals waiting to react
  
  And then I went and set you off with goodbye
  
  And now we're just a mushroom cloud in the sky
  
  And there's no silver lining, only just surviving
  
  And through the smoke all I could see were your eyes
  
  And boy, I never burned so bad from the fire
  
  And they could see the ashes falling from miles
  
  And now there's just no ending, only all this wreckage
  
  [P
  
  We weren't just wrong, we were an atom bomb
  
  What's yours, what's mine
  
  Keep trying to pick up what’s left of me (Pick of what’s left of me)
  
  Breathe slow, let go but that smoke just keeps suffocating me (Keeps suffocating me)
  
  Maybe you were already on fire
  
  And maybe when you touched me so was I
  
  I should have known we would explode 'cause I saw the signs
  
  And then I went and set you off with goodbye
  
  And now we're just a mushroom cloud in the sky
  
  And there's no silver lining, only just surviving
  
  And through the smoke all I could see were your eyes
  
  And boy, I never burned so bad from the fire
  
  And they could see the ashes falling from miles
  
  And now there's just no ending, only all this wreckage
  
  We weren't just wrong, we were an atom bomb
  
  Just watching all those embers fall like rain coming down
  
  Strange not to talk, not write, not call you when you're not around
  
  Your love so dangerous
  
  Your touch like a spark on my gasoline heart
  
  And then I went and set you off with goodbye
  
  And now we're just a mushroom cloud in the sky
  
  And there's no silver lining, only just surviving
  
  And through the smoke all I could see were your eyes
  
  And boy, I never burned so bad from the fire
  
  And they could see the ashes falling from miles

   What about you? did u ever get the chance to be a normal teen? cuz i can imagine that being a celebrity can be tiresome.
  ","
  I mean I lived a pretty normal life, we don't have to worry about having security guards around us 24/7 everytime we went out or paparazzi following us. Or media scandals etc. I was still allowed to do the things I loved to do and work. I was homeschooled so I was able to get up whenever and start my work and then finish and go play or do an extracurricular  activity like swimming. Which I can thank our mom for managing our career and scheduling things etc. We did have managers and so on from 2010-2015 and great experience but overall life was normal. People just knew who we were, and would stop and ask for like a picture or something. We were hardly ever in the media for anything bad. People just hated on us because they didnt like the way we sang or something. The only thing we worry about is our security guard when touring and stuff now.
  "
909152,"
   Which do you like better, TV series or movies?

   Bill Gates openly said that he wants to depopulate the human population with vaccines and people think that he wants to micro-chip everybody and give them digital IDs. Some people also think he purposely rolled out the virus, so people would get the vaccines. What are your thoughts on this?
  ","
  Conspiracies  most likely. But the corona virus has been out for a long time and never was this bad. According to what I read some scientist in a lab in China injected a bunch of bats with the virus and released them, which somehow caused them to fly over here to the us and eat all those mosquitos. The mosquitos then in turn bit us that were infected and transferred  it onto humans and they didnt know about it till this outbreak occured? Another thing I heard was someone from china got it from eating bat soup and traveled over here and spread it. But deep down I just feel this is all like a government scam to cause people to panic and it's all made up besides we dont actually know if people are dying just from having corona virus alone and its not related to some other health issue they had and didnt know about...

   Hey, Lauren... so I've read the lyrics of Atom Bomb (not listened). I was wondering if you considered the historical implications of how many people died because of the atom bomb when you used this idea for a love song and the use of the words ""we weren't (just) wrong"" ? Is it inconsiderate ?
  ","
  Yes I did, many people have referenced bombs and stuff in their music and people never attacked others as for atom bomb. It's not like I'm saying a nuclear bomb or atomic   bomb ... it's literally atom bomb. And the full song isn't even out so dont judge without hearing the FULL version

   What happened?
  ","
  It was a funeral I had to attend. I also was working at a friends cafe and helping them set up and stuff so I had to attend the funeral but be out there by four. It was o ly for family but for some reason a friend thought it would be totally fine to attend just because ""emilio"" was there. And i was already being bombarded by hugs from family members who haven't seen me in a few years that I was kinda overwhelmed and just emotional as well. And she tried to come up and hug me but I just excused myself and went towards the restrooms. She later blocked and unfriended me and texted my mother saying i refused to hug her. But what she didnt understand  is the i have anxiety, I'm not a touchy touchy person. I was already mid panic attack because so many people were around me... and I couldn't function on just a few people at a time.

   Innocent until proven guilty? 

Or do you think they should prove their innocence?

 ....Why?
  ","
  Here in the us its innocent until proven guilty which means the judge and detective eyck have to find evidence involving the case and suspect in order to actually charge them with a crime. But however I seen where they thought one person was guilty because they looked identical to someone but here they were innocent the whole time. Hopefully they liked sued the heck out of the court system and everything

  You're brother is wrong. However you shouldn't listen or believe what other people say or think about you. Only you KNOW who you truly are  and what you do

909617,"
   What is your opinion on women who have at least 3 kids all with different fathers but only one pays child support. In that situation do you think it’s okay for the women to use the child support check to use on the kids that are not his?ex. School trip,clothes etc. And should the dad be fine with it
  ","
  It's kinda a two way side. Because while the real father may not be involved the ""step dad"" or someone else could have adopted the child as his which means he has certain rights so it would be his responsibility  to pay for all the children even if they're not biologically his. However if the real father is involved then it's his responsibility  to make sure his child gets what is needed and make sure the mother is actually spending the money he gives on only his child. But maybe the real father isn't involved and someone stepped up to the plate to take care of all three of the kids and he gives money for the two that may not be his so they don't feel left out bc only his child is receiving money. Lol

  I try to replace curse words, especially since there's my brother Michaels girlfriends daughters that hang around the family house or are with amy and lisa. Dani curses now though.... alot.. but she's old enough to do so and married and no longer in the band and feels that she shouldn't have to censor herself on the web or anywhere it's the parents responsibility  🤷🏻‍♀️ however I don't like cussing at all especially knowing I have younger generations who look up to me and mimic what I do

   I tend to stutter or get stuck on words when speaking which usually results in awkward stare so I choose to stay quiet most of the time...any advice?

  Just be co fident and say what's on your mind. Lots of people have issues when speaking weather it's due to a slight speech delay, shyness, a brain injury that impacted that part of the brain or just pronouncing things differently than some. People who generally want to talk to you and be friends wouldn't laugh and make fun of you. Only the rude people who don't deserve your time

   a short message to your former lover:
  ","
  I don't think I ever would come to write this post, but yet here I am doing that exact same thing. Reflecting and looking back on memories. Thinking makes me realize how much we don't appreciate the things around us well enough or the people, their presence, or even just the sound of their voice until one day you blink and its gone forever. Jordan was my everything, even if we argued or went months without talking to each other. When I say he was my everything he was more then just my lover, my best friend, my favorite person... He literally was everything. And taken from us way to quick. Mental illnesses are not a joke, its not something to sit and mock. Its a reality, something most of us can't escape from. Something that haunts us... And before people bother to reach out to save us its to late... The demons inside already have gotten to us. I miss you so much. It just doesn't feel real to me at all. There's no explanation to how or when but just a text explaining youre never coming back. And literally all I did was blink .... And now you're gome for good. ... Thank you jordan for showing me how to have confidence in myself, for being weird with me, for being such a good person who saw the best in everyone when they didn't even see it themselves. Your laugh was contagious just as well as your smile 💖 you were special and always will be.

  Hey guys, y’all haven’t had an update from me in a while so here we go. Being quarantined has given me a lot of time to think and just kind of sit with myself. A lot of feelings/problems have come up that would’ve been easy to push away with all the distractions of normal life. I have spent many nights between the hours of 1am and 4am crying and trying to sort myself out. The biggest thing I’m learning is to come to terms with the truths of myself and my life. Bad things happen. We make bad choices. We have demons we don’t want to have. But if it happened it happened, and ruminating on how it shouldn’t have happened or you should’ve done something differently only prolongs your own mental torture. It’s okay that it happened. I made it through. I got stronger because of it. Yeah in a perfect world it shouldn’t have happened, but this world is far from perfect and this is what we have to deal with. The past can’t hurt you anymore. It’s gone. It’s over. All you can do is accept it, learn from it, make better choices this time, or just walk in confidence knowing that if it happens again, you know how to handle it. Life truly is a tragedy, but all the best stories are. ❤️

But I also have some pretty great friends and family that I can talk to about certain things who are always there and I know I can count on. I also been seeing my therapist more and having deep conversations with her as well (before all this lockdown happened).

  Well you can install custom content and tons of mods and have the store. On console you can only get what's in the game and have to like rebuild certain things BC you don't have all the games packs for it. And they won't let you download cc for some reason or mods.

  I rarely play. Kinda wish they would improve the babies to be like more then just an object that lays in a basketnet (is that how its spelled) and cries. Like I want to see them actually make the bottle or feed them in a highchair (I know u can with the toddlers), but what about actually bathing the babies where's the changing tables, cribs, swings, bouncers strollers etc. Hopefully they come out with like a stuff pack or something. Kinda waiting for generations as well

  ","

  Literally I feel this is all just some fake made up break out tbh. Yes corona is real and all but its been out in this world for decades and now that the elections are coming up there's all of a sudden a break out on something that's been existing for years? And never been an issue until now? And what also doesn't make sense.... Wuhan was the direct source of this but it didn't really affect any of the surrounding areas or cities around it? And mysteriously (I'm not sure if this is actually how it happened or not) they inject it into the bats and the bats fly over to the us in the summer time and eat the mosquito's or whatever and the mosquito's bite us and infection us? Just doesnt make sense. Then theyre talking about this can go on way past summer? Like what else do you really need to take from us ?

Shutting down jobs so tons of us loose income and struggle to feed our children or pay bills and so on...

  It’s definitely strange spending this holiday at home with a severe weather warning but it’s just another reminder that there’s more to this celebration than the usual festivities. We know this is a hard time full of anxiety and uncertainty but we hope you can find a little bit of joy in today and celebrate this wonderful day as well as you can. He is risen! Let’s celebrate at home, 2020 style! 🙌🏼❤️

  Happy Easter 🙏🏼 I have to say it’s difficult celebrating Easter with the world in it’s current state. Lent is usually one of the biggest times of spiritual growth for me, but it was not the same this year. Having to livestream mass, not being able to be in the presence of the Eucharist, and just being in such a state of chaos and uncertainty has made it hard to feel close with God lately. But His sacrifice out of nothing but pure love for us and His rising up from death reminds me that no matter what I’m going through, no matter how close or far I feel, and no matter how dark it seems, the war has already been won. And He is the victor. He is risen 🙌🏼

   Is it possible for humans to create something completely novel and new that is based on nothing that previously existed? 

Or is human creativity just rearranging and building on previous ideas?
  ","
  I think maybe a bit of both. Because new things are something we've never had before or would've probably thought about. But there was always the tools around to build new things on... Like houses evolving before people used to sleep in caves and look now we have apartments and everything.  Or certain cars are built based off the designs of an older version or an idea. Signature collector items like barbie come from the style or a movie look etc.

  ","
  Not that they necessary ""died"" but I stopped watching the fosters BC the original actor who played jesus (hey soos ) randomly quit during filming for the 5th season to date this over obsessive fan girl of his. So they replaced him with noah from all the boys I ever loved. And I just didn't like the change at first. Went back and rewatched it and now enjoy the spinoff version of it

   Hi! Would you mind telling me a little what my life would be like if I were your son? Would you be strict or not? What about school for me? What about religion? What do you expect from me? (Hope you don't mind me asking, I was curious what my life'd be like)
  ","
  I think I would want to be protected from the media and try to limit your identity to the public while you're growing up BC people are strange and like to claim other people's children as their own or judge based off what the child chooses to be and do later on in life. You would have a big supportive family so no moment would go uncelebrated and there will always be someone around to talk to or hang out with. You would have a family that is hardworking, compassionate towards the things they love and talented in many areas such as music and construction related things. You're aunts would be the ones who share their passion for music with you if you wanted to, or your uncles would teach you the ways to living life on the wild side (sports, camping, fishing, driving four wheels or you can have a jam out session with michael and play guitar). Your grandpa would be the fun goofy one who you adore and grandma would be the one with a generous heart who would probably always make you snacks and spoil you lol. I would be kinda strict but also the fun parent as well. Only be strict when it is needed like you acting out or doing something wrong like hitting and adult. I want to home school all my children BC I feel a child should learn at their own pace and not be forced to advance or be left behind because they can't compete with their peers. I know the anxiety children get when their friends can count to 100 and yours can only count to 50. .. And many children feel something is wrong with them and get bullied because they're a bit different then their peers...  As for religion I would love for you to follow the catholic faith as religion is very important to me, but if you choose to be interested in another religion that would be fine. As far as expectations always do your best towards things that may be a challenge and never be afraid to do what makes you happy

  Yes. That's why we are scared to take a risk because we do not always know the outcome, that's why we continue to overthink certain choices in life and constantly ask ourselves why?... When the real thing we need to do is just leap into the water of fear and unknown and take chances into discovering it.

  I'm in a band with four/ five of my sisters. Been since I was 8. Was signed to island records in 2010 but then we were left unhappy with the music industry trying to turn us into something we've never wanted to be. So broke away and moved to nashville in 2015 and became independent so we run everything ourselves now. Which means youtube videos, recording, filming, editing, song writing etc.

  Life feels very scary right now. A lot of things are so uncertain for so many. It’s easy to lose hope when you look at the world and you see so much darkness. We want to bring some light through every project we’re doing right now. Even if that’s just through a T shirt you wear to bed or a sweatshirt you just wear around the house for now. Although for some, your physical health and financial security might not be at risk, we know that self isolation can be really hard on mental health, and that a lot of you feel alone right now. We want to remind you that you’re not alone. We’re all in this together and we’ll make it through this. Introducing the Believe In You Handwritten Collection. Each piece features an uplifting lyric from our song Believe In You, with designs drawn by Dani and words handwritten by Katherine. Coming this Saturday, 4/11 at 11:00am EST. From our hearts, to yours. ❤️

  Not that I noticed.

   Not gonna post too much about my anxiety on here. But from my own personal experience that’s not a good sign. And yeah. I try to get out....... but like I don’t get out of the car. And I can’t go on walks because of my anxiety. I can’t even make it halfway down the road from my house.
  ","
  I used to shut down and became really depressed where I didn't want to talk to hardly anyone or do anything I loved. If I tried to talk to someone other than those I'm used to being around my heart would start to race and I would get frustrated and probably cry. I used to be awake all hours of the night BC my mind just wouldn't shut off. I thought I was actually going crazy at one point because I would be asleep and randomly get startled awake because I think I heard a certain sound or someone was calling my name only to wake up and realize nothing was there or everyone was asleep. If i went down into the basement or was left alone somewhere I felt like I was being watched and someone is out to get me.

  "
911712,"
   We seriously NEED more people like you. In my town people just snub their noses to the struggling. Unless if it’s a well known family that is. I think we as a society should be able to help those in need and those struggling mentally and emotionally.
  ","
  A reason why so many people are like that is they assume because of one person being an addict that all are like that ...

   They don’t care. The “officials”. They could care less about the ones struggling. They don’t care anything about the mental health stigma nor the abused children. And again it’s downright heartbreaking.

  Like today I literally had to pull off the road and cry to myself for a moment BC I dont think they understand how shutting down all these businesses is not only making them loose revenue and money but its also making people who usually bust their backs struggle because they have no income coming in to pay their rent, utilities or provide care for their children. I saw a waitress I know from a small business and diner standing holding a sign that said she was struggling, she's a single mother who actually works to make sure her children have everything and to see her at her lowest point broke my heart so yes I did do a good deed today and handed her enough to get diapers or food for her and her family
  "
911719,"

   I deal with high functioning anxiety, it’s not easy nor fun. And very understandable. It’s heartbreaking when I read stories of kids taking their own lives. And you’re right. They do have their whole lives ahead of them. I just wish if they could have seen how worth it they were. And still are.

  I honestly feel bad for those people who have to be on lockdown with mental illnesses or abusive families where their only safe place was by going to work or school. I understand its hard being in one place for so long or around others who are toxic and manipulative and you can't really go anywhere to escape, which can lead us into getting into our heads way to much. However please find something that helps calm.you down even. If its going for a walk around the corner, coloring, listening to music or just seperating yourself in a separate room for awhile. We are all on this tough time together and with the lockdown I have been hearing so many sad ending stories to beautiful people's life taken way to soon due to shootings, or suicide. If you ever need to talk please reach out to me and I'll try my best to respond immediately which I can not always promise I'll be there. But you matter and someone cares about you 💖

  I was in the back of my dad’s red Jeep when the line “All I do is think about you these days” popped into my head. I kept playing it over and over in my head so I would remember it and could record it as soon as I got home. I tend to be a little bit obsessive so when I say “all I do is think about you these days” it’s not an overstatement. Unfortunately you can’t control who stays and who leaves and even when you try your hardest but you can’t always control your mind and stop yourself from thinking about someone when they do leave. I think loss is one of the hardest things to understand. It just doesn’t make sense how someone could be there one day and be gone the next. I think we sometimes think that if we could just think about it enough and go through the story over and over and over, one day we’ll understand what happened and what went wrong and how to move forward. I’m not sure that’s how it works though. Some things just don’t make sense and that’s the only answer there is. I also have a strange obsession with writing sad songs and making them really upbeat so enjoy this aggressively sad jumble of mixed emotions 🤪 Stream These Days now and check out the lyric video

   Do you think that it is okay for white people to use the n word like the way black people use it to like  acknowledge a friend or be cool or whatever? And as a bonus do you say the n word to your friends or behind black peoples back?
  ","
  I don't think it is... I know some people still feel offended when its the opposite race saying it. And I don't really blame them BC how would we feel if someone went around calling us a insult like word for indians or white people you would be hurt as well even if it was meant as a joke or not. And no I don't. I simply just say hello, hey what's up or something along those lines

   How would you explain the word love to someone without using the word “love”?
  ","
  Kinda like always having butterflies in your stomach, you cant get them off your mind no matter how hard you try, you always want to be around their presence, do things for them or just hear their voice or smell a familiar scent they wear. You just want to be protective over them and see them reach milestones and accomplishments and be proud of themselves ....
