khaki pants , belt , close toed shoes , no weird hair , no shorts , dresses had to be collared , skirts went past knees , ect . so yeah when i realized i was pans i was immediately treated like shit by teachers and students alike . so now i can finally be myself and i am proud of my identity . so yes i did get upset when you literally disrespected my identity . that s like going up to a trans person and saying why are you so passionate about being trans ? i m straight and i am not that passionate for ffs that is literally disregarding someones identity . what you did was not right

with no idea why they have a reason to be passionate about . not everyone is straight and not everyone had the same events and such as you . so you do need to grow up and you are an idiot by not acknowledging the differences . you shouldn t assume and all you re doing is making yourself seem like a bigger asshole . and i quoted you . if you see the quotation marks , a common symbol used in the english language to mark the start of a quotation or speech . you can see these in books and such if you didn t know .","730886":"grow up","730887":"hi","730888":"no","730889":"no . it s my
