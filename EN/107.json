railroad with a friend and push all the villagers into carts to steal them away to a locked basement . like , i stole the whole village . that s what i mean by i can be spiteful i did a hateful little

have a specific music playlist designed to soothe my anxiety , self care , drinking periodically which sucks but eh it s coping i have a nest in my home that is essentially my calm spot to spend most of my day where my art and computer and the bird are . sleep is a way i cope . i should probably slow my roll with the drinking but right now it s the only thing that seems to help this muscle spasm

shit","99797":"toxic masculinity was proven here tonight when after being met with defensiveness you still persisted until i responded as you wanted and bent my will . you assumed i would be willing
