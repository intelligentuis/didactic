good way to make someone s day","593161":"you can do it , i believe in you","593162":"sure","593163":"nobody needs it . you shouldn t have to try to look perfect for anyone . cause think about it

side especially if i don t know you .","593184":"he s pretty funny . you just got to lay back and be able to relate to the stuff he says","593185":"that s hard . i would have to say kevin hart though . i feel like he knows how to have a good time and it ll be fun drinking with him","593186":"somebody call batman because i just got the joker","593187":"depends on how i want people to view me","593188":"that everyone is equal","593189":"mhm that i can say the most random stuff at the wrong time and still change the mood of someone","593190":"that i m me","593191":"honestly it really depends because there s so many different types of apples out there and they all taste different . i like them both for sure so i don t think i could decide on just one but if i had to make the choice

out there for you . you may of have just not met that person yet . maybe god is just waiting for the right time when you both feel in a dark place to light the way for each other .","593252":"i m good at keeping a secret . it s honestly not hard to keep something private in this world anymore . i mean no one talks to anyone anymore like society use to be . everyone just looks down on everyone and judges them and views them to be less and not capable of themselves . it makes me sick to be honest that we live in this type of world where we don t help anyone anymore . . . we just watch people

when i do i ll continue a thread for this question","593267":"hobbs and shaw tbh . i feel like i fit both of their personalities at times","593268":"no one is ugly . everyone is beautiful in their own way .","593269":"yes . i ve lost plenty of friends in life . that s why now i only have family cause i know family will be there for you no matter what","593270":"love and happiness and people . people bring you happiness and you can t use money to buy people because people should love you for who you are and not for the things you have .","593271":"i went to costa rica and found my love for coffee lol","593272":"hip about months . leg months","593273":"yes . hip and leg surgery","593274":"no","593275":"i m fat already so i got nothing to

a selfie of me just waking up on my camera roll","593292":"thanks . for the follow . i ll follow back","593293":"you probably have feelings for her or care about her immensely even though you may not of realized it till now","593294":"i think i would take a cruise on the caribbean . i don t think i could choose just place to visit for a week . i rather travel to different places and do an

juan , puerto rico . i heard it was really amazing going there and i would love to learn more about the culture and way of life .","593307":"it just comes . i mean i ve been through it all . growing up for me was rough . i was different from everyone else . i was always judged . didn t really have any friends or anything . only friend i really had growing up was my sister . and my dog .","593308":"that s the thing . you can t let judgement affect who you are . no one can change who you are . that s why every individual in the world is so amazing . everyone has a secret talent that no one else has . the people that rely on judgement to take away your freeness of love and happiness are those that don t know what that s like . . . maybe it s cause those people don t know what it s like to be happy .","593309":"that s the interesting thing about life people don t get . if you live your life without worrying how to spend it you can get so much more done while trying to figure out how life works","593310":"yea it s just hard to even be able to prove that .","593311":"i heard about that . i want to believe it but i m not sure if i do .","593312":"idk honestly . that s a really good question and i need to think to figure that one out","593313":"i don t stereotype . if you have a good heart and respect everyone i like you .","593314":"thanks","593315":"i use alcohol wipes . i

normally try to tired myself out again","593328":"they re both good but i got to go with doritos because of the more variations they have","593329":"it s different for everyone . honestly best thing to do is ask the person about there perfect date and see what you can do to make that a reality for them","593330":"not really .","593331":"impractical jokers","593332":"going out with good people","593333":"my lexus is f sport","593334":"i think like a couple weeks ago i got a chocolate milkshake at chick fil a","593335":"no idea .","593336":"treasure","593337":"class","593338":"my pleasure to help . overall it is your kids decision to do what he she wants to do with their life . you can only control so much . if anything maybe you both could see a counselor and maybe get help as another suggestion that way the bond between you two don t break .","593339":"you too","593340":"any really . as long as i have food for cafe con leche i m up and alive","593341":"valekrys because we are basically the same person and i feel like we can get along perfectly because of all our similarities and views","593342":"how perfect my dork is i wish i could be as perfect as

am depending on school work or the current task i m working on","593349":"that s hard . honestly i like most tv shows and i love to switch things up when i feel some get over rated in my opinion . so honestly i couldn t tell you .","593350":"if this is who i think it is . invite those two people in your stats class over for our get together friday . trust me . i won t embarrass you but it s a good way to get to know someone","593351":"i know . you ll learn . just trust what i say .","593352":"yea lmao . she means a lot to me . no money in the world could replace her . i rather have no money and be with her then have all the money in the world and not have her by my side","593353":"is salt really bitter though","593354":"lmao i hate this question . i actually had a porn company reach how to me before on my instagram page they offered to pay me k per video . but i would probably say no only cause i couldn t be in the porn industry when i m with another person and trying to make things work with them","593355":"someone s saltier than the ocean oh whale","593356":"love is a story isn t it ? it starts at nothing and then as time goes on you find if it s true . that s why i said it s in progress .","593357":"haha sometimes . but yes i experienced bad luck in ways unimaginable","593358":"i m now . i ve been drinking since i was a sophomore in high school so probably about at the time . however it was only on occasions like parties and new years if i was home and wasn t going out that night . honestly it s all about being responsible with alcohol . i have parties every friday at my apartment and i make sure no one leaves if they get to messed up because i always make sure there s someone sober there for safety and responsibility of us . now for drugs i would recommend staying away from them completely . they have no benefits what so ever . if anything they just make you depressed and ruin your life . so many of my friends are in dark places now because of it and they re stuck there . hopefully this helps .","593359":"yes","593360":"well if aliens live in the us they should be able to speak whatever language they please . it s a free country","593361":"creating a lab report for my digital systems class","593362":"i m pretty sure i do . but i visit a lot of places though . i don t think i could name just one lol","593363":"my

kind of does though . i m pretty sure i made more people laugh and because of my more social aspect it s easier for me to make people laugh .","593372":"lmao ok catfish","593373":"well for sure it s cause i m funny","593374":"this is why you almost failed comp . and english is your first language","593375":"exactly cause i m funny","593376":"feel like this is the reason why people can t speak or write proper english","593377":"i don t know about that .","593378":"suga walls ?","593379":"you might be funny but you re not my scale funny and you know that s the truth . remember summer before the

been a great feeling . granite i went through some rough times that only certain people know about but i learned from those experiences and i know how to handle my feelings when i fall in love .","593388":"it could mean a lot of things in different context . it could show that the girl is open for the boy to talk to her , if she smiles at all your jokes even if they aren t really funny , it can mean she might be interested in you , it can mean a lot . i would assume it would show that the girl is open and that she wants you to talk to her but i wouldn t assume anything else if you both never talked before .","593389":"those who think they re better than everyone else","593390":"lmao i m good for that . maybe after i get my masters in business administration","593391":"hmm . that s difficult . if there was a job i could create it would be called the wonderful position . now the great thing about this wonderful position is that for one day you have freedom to do what you want however the only restriction is that you can only benefit the people that need it such as those that live on the street . and it allows you to change there life and give them the life they wish to live","593392":"there s a robin hood somewhere . so yes","593393":"lmao","593394":"lmao but you already had left over panda","593395":"you bought some yesterday . remember lol","593396":"you re life .

i ll drink just about anything . you can ask valekrys shes my drinking partner","593444":"ah . dreams . they re amazing . i wish i could remember all of them but i only remember select few unfortunately one dream that i always remember is a self conscious of my dog cocoa who passed . it was amazing that my dream somehow gave me a way to communicate with my dog and he spoke to me . he told me that since he passed he wanted me to do everything for him in his name . so all my successes that come from now on are done for him as well as a few others who help me come to those successes .","593445":"love is a feeling , expression , emotion all mixed into one . only yourself can personally feel and interpret because love is different for everyone . for me , love is being able to do whatever it takes to make the person who you care about in life happy . even if that means sacrificing your own time just to make sure the time of that person is put well to use and is happy and that they know you would protect them no matter the cost .","593446":"i wasn t exactly sure how to answer it i gave it my best shot though","593447":"i got to spend time with her","593448":"it doesn t mean anything tbh . you shouldn t fall for someone because of the way they look or for their body . you should fall for someone because of their personality . that s why relationships now a days don t work because everyone is just trying to have sex for the way people look and nothing is for love anymore .","593449":"thanks i appreciate that . but i m always down for friendships lol","593450":"i follow my own program . everything is done just based on how i feel needs work","593451":"iphone","593452":"thanks . i m talking to someone right now . she knows who she is . i m hoping everything works out for the best between us .","593453":"nope .","593454":"you re about to get your account hacked","593455":"well , based on how i talk a lot of people would assume english . however , i think i can see myself teaching more history than any other subject . i just find history so appealing and it allows us as a society to not make similar mistakes we made in the past . it shows all the differences we overcome as a whole and shows that no matter our backgrounds that we should all care for each other and help each other out .","593456":"i would live today as it was my tomorrow . i would try to learn something new or do something i never done before .","593457":"lmao squats","593458":"i knew it","593459":"probably hunter .","593460":"nah .","593461":"lmao yes .","593462":"where s the restraining

life has a job . being a student is a job , being a parent is a job , being successful is a job . nothing comes handed to you unless you work for it . all i m trying to say is if you rather travel because you can t sit behind a desk or run an office as a ceo or a position like that maybe you should look at becoming a traveling agent or work for a cruise ship or airplane airline that way you can travel for pretty cheap while getting paid for it . but that s just my suggestion based on your work ethic and the way you re making it seem .","593471":"steak and texas roadhouse rolls .","593472":"don t make excuses . just get shit done","593473":"lean meat , vegetables , and a little bit of carbs . i sell meal plans that come with monthly workouts if you re interested

about everyone . no one knows shit about anything . why ? cause no one talks to anyone anymore . everything is dark and pretends to be someone they aren t .","593485":"great . you ?","593486":"honestly i m the type of person to push it more than once but time is just a concept . it s not even real . we just make it real because that s how everyone is used to it .","593487":"hey","593488":"some people aren t social","593489":"let s take a second and focus on society as a whole instead of your question . our whole society is fucked up and no one wants to do shit about it . everyone just points and laughs at those that are helpless and hopeless . no one understands that a simply hi or how are you doing or even a smile to show them that everything will be ok can change someone s life . y all need to be more aware of what everyone else is going through instead of being self centered . this world we live in makes me sick .","593490":"i am goofy . it s what makes me a loser inside joke that only valekrys understands","593491":"football","593492":"well some things require sacrifice . if you travel a lot and that s something you don t want to give up then i would say whatever your degree was in is a waste of time and money and you should of just been a photographer and be instagram famous .","593493":"nope . unless your electricity cap is low

.","593497":"thanks you too","593498":"it s a power being able to not give a fuck . it doesn t come naturally especially with someone with your background","593499":"but know this with the power you re about to learn becomes necessary to have responsibilities . otherwise you got to be like me and whenever your parents yell at you you just laugh","593500":"a little bit you still got lots to learn","593501":"basically and how to not just give a fuck cause shit happens","593502":"be social . just say hi and asking how someone s day is going to make a huge impact in someone s life . yea it s nerve wrecking especially if you re shy like me but there s a good chance of making a new friend out of it .","593503":"nope . i m done with dating apps . i have met people but both of them aren t part of my life as of right now cause they thought the world revolves around them and only them","593504":"me","593505":"florida","593506":"that s a hard decision . let s see . money in the world today is a distraction . money is nice to have but it s not a necessity . and money can buy happiness . . . well that s a myth . it s not true . happiness isn t bought it s found . now to answer your question on what we should spend money on based on the facts listed above should be your main priorities such as food , water , medicine , basically your basic needs that will keep you healthy and safe . you don t need anything fancy to be happy .","593507":"it depends what model is are we talking about . ? if we re talking about the is f and then i ll have to choose the is f because it s a luxury sports race car basically . but if you re comparing a is or is to a g q you can t really choose because each have there pros and cons based on them being two different types of cars . you re basically comparing more of a speed demon car compared to a more laid back chill ride for traveling .","593508":"how old are you ? i had a job since i was years old . i worked for my own mowing company of course with the help of my parents getting me the things i needed . then at i applied and got hired at publix and currently am still there as of years . right now i m in college working towards my degree and looking for internships . so you saying you can t get a job as an early grad doesn t make any sense . so either your background history things you ve done in the past like records and stuff is terrible and that s why no place wants to hire you or you re just not putting in the work for a job and showing them that you standout compared to everyone else .","593509":"listen . too many people nowadays never listen . they just assume they know what the person is going to say and they talk over the person that s trying to explain themselves","593510":"my

from looks , from the way they interact with one another . feelings come mainly from one on one interactions . this may be correct or incorrect but like i said feelings work differently for everyone .

on my word and no matter how many times i fail in something i will succeed eventually","593544":"that s hard . they both of there pros and cons where i live lol . i would probably have to say summer because it allows me to do all my outdoor activities but with winter it gives me excuses to stay inside and stay warm all day","593545":"for me i m pursuing a bachelors degree in electrical and computer engineering as well as working for a masters degree in business administration . so being a ceo of an engineering company and leading projects and budgeting those projects would be the best

two after we broke up .","593555":"for the record . i know who you are . i m not a dumbass . i m not going to call you out though cause that s rude . but i focused on passing school and spending time with my family and friends cause i have people in my life that mean something to me . and for the record i didn t miss her birthday . i was in school so i didn t have a choice . but i did celebrate her birthday the week after by cooking her a home cooked meal and it was just the two of us so she can t say shit .","593556":"what do you mean ?","593557":"not me .","593558":"my fall ? what do you
