r*pe. if someone is wearing skimpy clothing and doesn't say yes, it's r*pe. i can go on and on.\n  ","406718":"\n  it's a common symptom, yeah. it doesn't mean that someone has social anxiety, but a

are psychological responses to trauma, or things that flash us back to those instances of trauma. they're largely out of our control until you begin to work on your triggers with therapy (cbt or dbt).\n  ","406724":"\n  just because your religion says that being gay is \"wrong\" doesn't mean you have to follow that way of thinking. we still have free will, and we can believe in a god or higher being while also being critical of religion for putting forth such notions as being anti-lgbt.\n  \n  i.e., i have quite a few friends who are very religious but are also very gay. the idea that god accepts and loves everyone regardless of their differences is also prominent in certain religions. being gay and being religious aren't mutually exclusive concepts.\n  ","406725":"\n  no, that's quite admirable. alcohol is honestly a terrible thing for people to get into because it's harmful to the body.\n  ","406726":"\n  medication and therapy work to a certain degree, but

don't work a low-end job, and the reason why i live with my parents at the age of 27 is because there's no such thing as affordable housing on long island. it has nothing to do with my past

see anything wrong with telling your boyfriend that you believe you're bisexual, as long as you make it clear that it doesn't affect the nature of your relationship. some people may interpret that as you wanting to break up & experiment ... but if you tell him you have no intention of doing that, i don't see what could go wrong.\n  \n  take this advice with a grain of salt, obviously. i don't know

open about my past relationships, i have nothing to hide and i feel comfortable talking about them at this point.\n  ","406774":"\n  lately, not very much. i used to play video games every night, and now i only play once every few weeks or so.\n  ","406775":"\n  not at all. i have no desire to be with anyone other than him. even though i'm bisexual, i don't want to date a woman because i'm already in love with someone and we're in a monogamous relationship.\n  ","406776":"\n  yeah, that's a difficult situation to be in. one of my other friends is currently going through the same thing with a man in her life who's also a good friend, and she doesn't really know what to do either.\n  \n  i don't really have much advice for these situations. i've always just went for it and ended up getting heartbroken as a result, lmao.\n  ","406777":"\n  it's a tie between skyrim and fallout 4. even though both games are relatively old at this point, i still really enjoy playing them. i'm always discovering new things.\n  ","406778":"\n  i believe i've loved four people so far in my life.\n  ","406779":"\n  i was pretty sad for a long time after the breakup, and we didn't talk for 1-2 years afterwards. however, we rekindled our friendship because we realized that we were great friends before we entered the relationship. and at that point, i was totally over her and knew i wouldn't develop feelings again.\n  ","406780":"\n  sometimes i wonder if we were actually experiencing trauma bonding, but considering we're still friends now (she's my best friend now), i don't think that's the case.\n  \n  the relationship was short-lived. she realized she was straight, and we broke up. lmao.\n  ","406781":"\n  no, we were preserving our own mental health by being private about our relationship. we were afraid our families would have negative things to say or not support us, and considering we were both going through ab*sive situations at the time, we didn't want to risk it being worse. i don't have any regrets.\n  ","406782":"\n  we weren't open about our relationship, there were only two or three of our friends who knew we were dating. we weren't embarrassed of each other, but we were afraid that there would be negative comments and backlash.\n  ","406783":"\n  we did break up during the first year of our relationship, yes. i went away to college and he was attending college at home, and we were also enduring a lot of struggles during that time which drove us apart even more. we decided to break up, which lasted perhaps 7-8 months before we got back together.\n  \n  we're not married yet because we're not financially ready to be married and have a wedding and whatnot. we also don't live together, and we want to have that independent experience before delving into marriage. we're not in any rush at all, it isn't a priority to us.\n  \n  i don't know if i want children, tbh.\n  ","406784":"\n  i knew i was bisexual before i ever entered a relationship with a woman. i simply had the same romantic feelings for women as i did for men. the fact that i did enter a relationship with a woman (my first relationship, actually) and then found that i also liked men in the same fashion confirmed it.\n  ","406785":"\n  LOL, thank you. we started dating when i was 17 years old, just after our high school graduations.\n  ","406786":"\n  we've been dating for 10 years.\n  ","406787":"\n  i'm not sure, haha. i haven't been in the \"dating game\" for quite some time. but i think it's natural for a lot of people to be unsure of their orientation, there's nothing wrong with that and it definitely doesn't mean they're looking for attention. they're simply confused, likely because they never had hands-on experiences for themselves.\n  ","406788":"\n  well, thank you very much. i truly do appreciate it.\n  ","406789":"\n  no, i wouldn't be able to handle such a profession. i have a difficult enough time processing and dealing with my own thoughts and behavior, i wouldn't be able to cope with taking on the thoughts and worries of another person. i wouldn't want to feel responsible for their happiness.\n  ","406790":"\n  well, i'm in a relationship so naturally i want to marry my boyfriend. however, i have no qualms with marrying a woman. like i said, i'm bisexual. someone's sex or gender doesn't much matter to me at all.\n  ","406791":"\n  yeah, i do want to get married eventually. i think it's an expression of love in a traditional sense, even though there's a lot of legal aspects to marriage as well.\n  ","406792":"\n  i find that it's harder to find women who are bisexual or gay, for whatever reason. i think it's because being heterosexual is still seen as the \"standard,\" and a lot of bisexual\/gay women exist but it's difficult to really ... find them ?? unless you go on a dating site, or something.\n  \n  but no, for me personally there was no difference. i don't really care about someone's sex or gender, i find a lot of different people attractive.\n  ","406793":"\n  i barely got through them, haha. i developed very unhealthy coping mechanisms as a result, i self-harmed for almost a decade, and i've attempted s*icide. i still consider myself to be a weak person.\n  \n  however, i appreciate the kind words.\n  ","406794":"\n  yeah, although it was mostly online. i never advertised it in my real life, so i never felt kickback from being bisexual. i've only become more open about my orientation over the past five years or so, but people are much more accepting now than in the past.\n  ","406795":"\n  yes, the lyrics are one of my favorite aspects of most songs. they can make or break a song, in my opinion. i have the utmost respect for musicians who are also wonderful writers.\n  \n  i really like the lyrics to grandson's \"thoughts & prayers\" ;\n  \n  \"no thoughts, no prayers can bring back what's no longer there. the silent are damned, the body count is on your hands.\"\n  ","406796":"\n  aw, this is super sweet. thank you ~~\n  \n  i definitely don't agree with the idea that i'm strong, but it's something i'm actively working on (self-esteem and such). i've overcome some obstacles during my life, but i've struggled greatly with them too.\n  ","406797":"\n  i realized i was bisexual when i was 11 years old. i've dated both men and women since then, which sorta solidified my sexual orientation because i noticed that i felt the same towards them.\n  \n  it wasn't difficult for me to come out, at least to my friends, because many of my friends are also bisexual or gay. i didn't tell my family, i think they at least figured it out while i was still a teenager though. it's never been a topic of conversation in my family.\n  ","406798":"\n  haha, no problem. lgbtq+ rights is something i feel very strongly about.\n  ","406799":"\n  considering i'm bisexual, no. even if i was heterosexual, i wouldn't judge people for being gay, pan, bi, etc etc. people love who they love, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n  ","406800":"\n  no, he doesn't normally drink. if he does drink, it's once every few months or so and he'll only have one or two beers at the most.\n  ","406801":"\n  yeah, i definitely believe that disappointment feels worse than hatred. if someone hates you, then that's more of a \"them\" problem than a \"you\" problem, because that person is holding onto that negative energy, not you.\n  \n  someone being disappointed in you, on the other hand, feels so much worse -- particularly when it's a loved one or a friend.\n  ","406802":"\n  meeting with upper management at work. i had to go to a meeting with the COO of the company last friday, and my anxiety skyrocketed the entire morning before i had to meet with her. i'm always terrified that i'm not going to portray myself or my thoughts in the correct way. i'm also afraid that they're going to criticize me for my work performance.\n  ","406803":"\n  i find that rude people are also very ignorant, so rude people are definitely more irritating since they portray both traits. in some cases, they're aware of their behavior as well, and the fact that they actively choose to be a rude or bad person is aggravating as well.\n  ","406804":"\n  not very well at all, haha. i have a tendency to dwell on my failures and find it difficult to move on from them.\n  ","406805":"\n  the scarlet letter by nathaniel hawthorne. i had to read in when i was in high school, and it was the most boring and pretentious book i've ever read.\n  ","406806":"\n  i haven't traveled much aside from going 1,700 miles away from new york to texas five years ago. i really liked the city of austin, but i don't know if i could live there permanently.\n  \n  i would want to visit other places, especially internationally, before deciding on where to live. i like the idea of traveling to england, though.\n  ","406807":"\n  yes, this is true as well. however, for all i know that anon is also dieting. it wasn't something we touched upon in our previous conversation.\n  \n  i eat mostly healthy, but because of my alcohol use in the past and current drinking habits, i think that also put a damper on my weight. there's a lot i need to improve upon.\n  ","406808":"\n  general tso's chicken, even though it's probably totally unhealthy for you, lol.\n  ","406809":"\n  that's really discouraging, so i completely understand where you're coming from. you have to remain committed, though. i haven't lost weight recently and i kinda plateaued, but i think it's because of my monthly period cycle and i'm always going to weigh more before and during my period, probably because of water retention ?? i'm not entirely sure.\n  \n  either way, i hope it works out for you this time around. :'))\n  ","406810":"\n  yeah, i experience the same thing. it's difficult for me to lose weight, which is why i've only lost 12 pounds in two months.\n  \n  you should try to weigh yourself in the morning before you eat, i find that it's most accurate to have sorta a \"baseline\" weight. also, you have to remember your weight fluctuates each day as well depending on what you've eaten and how much activity you did.\n  ","406811":"\n  once you start working out, you will be !! it takes time, so don't get discouraged in the beginning. every time you attend the gym, you work on yourself little by little. take each day at a time.\n  ","406812":"\n  i understand that completely. that was another reason why i was hesitant on going to the gym, i felt embarrassed of my size and how out of shape i was\/still am.\n  ","406813":"\n  i was in denial at the time, unfortunately. it's only been within the past month or two that i acknowledged that it was a big issue.\n  ","406814":"\n  i just explained this in more detail below. however, the short answer is no. i have a treadmill in my house.\n  ","406815":"\n  i've been exercising for about two months now.\n  ","406816":"\n  i don't feel comfortable taking a picture, sorry. i also haven't physically changed much, haha.\n  ","406817":"\n  that's great !! i used to go to the gym, but i found it difficult to actually get there and work out because i have anxiety and couldn't get myself to drive there a lot of times. especially after my best friend moved away, we used to attend the gym together and i wasn't as dedicated when i was by myself.\n  \n  two months ago, however, my family allowed me to take the treadmill that we have in the house and move it upstairs so i can work out in peace. it used to be in my parents' bedroom, and i never wanted to work out there because my father is always in the bedroom. but ever since i got that privacy, i've been working out consistently.\n  ","406818":"\n  it usually takes me 20-25 minutes, depending on how fast i run. there are also times where i take breaks and speed-walk instead.\n  ","406819":"\n  i'm working on increasing my stamina because i'm so out of shape, so i can really only do two miles at a time. i usually work out every other day.\n  ","406820":"\n  i've only mentioned this briefly in the past because i didn't feel comfortable going into the details of it, but i'm in the process of working on an alcohol dependency and decreasing my use of alcohol as a coping mechanism. i went from drinking 4-5 nights per week to only drinking once per week, and instead of getting blackout drunk like i used to get, i limit myself to three drinks at the most.\n  \n  it's something i'm pretty proud of, even though people don't know about it, and i'm also embarrassed to admit that it was\/is a problem. everyone in my life was worried about me and it took me a long time to acknowledge that it was an issue in my life. but i'm working towards recovering.\n  ","406821":"\n  i would bring my boyfriend. i've always wanted to travel, and recently he told me that he wanted to travel more often and experience more of the world. he just came back from a four-day long camping trip with his friends, and it opened his eyes to the experiences he felt he was missing out on in his youth.\n  ","406822":"\n  yeah, sometimes so many things go wrong at once that it feels like something in the world is preventing me from achieving much or being happy. it makes me feel hopeless and at a loss of what to do, and it's pretty discouraging.\n  \n  when i'm feeling this way, i try opening myself up to my boyfriend and friends in order to receive support and encouragement. they have a good way of motivating me and making me see the positive side of things so that i can continue moving forward.\n  ","406823":"\n  a serotonin deficiency.\n  ","406824":"\n  i would try to explain it through emotions -- different emotions give off the impression of different colors to me. it may be difficult, however, because i don't think everyone experiences emotions in the same way.\n  \n  however, i associate red with anger. blue with tranquility and relaxed. black with dangerous thoughts\/depression. and purple with joy and enthusiasm.\n  ","406825":"\n  i've been running on the treadmill. i lost 12 pounds so far !!\n  ","406826":"\n  i don't know anyone specifically, but i did find this really informative video on long island accents !!\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/fepgtXjFo7Q\n

i've never had an interest in being polyamorous. although i do have a lot of respect for my friends who are and have multiple partners, it takes a lot of openness and communication to maintain poly relationships.\n  ","406829":"\n  no, i don't need to know if someone liked me to feed my ego. if anything, it's always made me uncomfortable.\n  \n  additionally, i'm in a relationship. so that's already an indication that i wouldn't like them back anyway, lol.\n  ","406830":"\n  the question asked how i would like someone to tell me if they liked me. i took that in a romantic context, so i responded that it would be useless for someone to tell me that because i'm not single.\n  \n  i can see the confusion, though. i honestly didn't even think of the word \"like\" in the way you're describing, that's a friendly platonic way of liking someone as a friend. usually when people say they like you, they mean that they have feelings for you.\n  ","406831":"\n  i don't discuss my sex life on the internet.\n  ","406832":"\n  so? i'm just emphasizing that it would be useless to tell me because i wouldn't be interested in them back anyway.\n  ","406833":"\n  yeah, i've been exercising to lose weight.\n  ","406834":"\n  i'm the wrong person to ask, my dude. lmaoo. i'm extremely insecure about my appearance and have never been able to accept myself. however, i've slowly been changing my appearance (through exercise) so that i would be more confident. if there's something you want to change and have the means to do so, then there's really nothing stopping you.\n  ","406835":"\n  i've never trashed feminists (*actual* feminists), but all right then. you're confusing that with my criticism of the third wave feminism movement, which is more for clout than anything else.\n  ","406836":"\n  today (july 20th) is a day of remembrance for me. a day of remembering the life, wisdom, and music of chester bennington. it's been two years since he passed away, and his influence on my life is *always* on my mind.\n  \n  i also have to keep mike shinoda and talinda bennington in mind, for helping and guiding the community in the healing process. none of us would have been able to get through this if it wasn't for their passion for the fanbase and wanting to make a difference in how we view mental health.\n  ","406837":"\n  no, i don't have a close relationship with my family. at this stage of my life, i don't have a desire to have a relationship with them either. i'm pretty much done, and once i move out of my parents' house, i don't want to keep in close contact.\n  ","406838":"\n  walk around the city and find things to do, like visit museums or see a play. i would also want to find a cute coffee shop to have breakfast at every day. essentially, i would want to try to experience the city in its entirety instead of staying in the hotel most of the time.\n  ","406839":"\n  lately, burrito bowls and sushi.\n  ","406840":"\n  i feel that. i'm successful in my career and whatnot but i wish i had that sense of independence and ability to live life on my own terms.\n  ","406841":"\n  he's not in a stable financial spot to pay rent at the moment.\n  ","406842":"\n  lose more weight, get another promotion at work, get my passport, and possibly find a house to rent with my friend.\n  ","406843":"\n  i'm in a relationship, so if someone did like me, it wouldn't matter how they told me because it won't make a difference in my relationship status. i'm not interested in knowing who likes me or who doesn't.\n  ","406844":"\n  i judge people harshly when they don't hold the door open for people if they're going through a doorway. you don't have to stand there and open the door *for* them, but at least hold the door open while you're walking through so that it doesn't slam in other people's faces.\n  ","406845":"\n  i once wrote the beginning of a book that was loosely based on my life. i titled it \"chasing the dragon.\"\n  ","406846":"\n  lately, i've been obsessed with ordering veggie burrito bowls, and sometimes burrito bowls with carnitas. i usually get a bowl with white rice, black beans, carnitas or tofu, tomato salsa (mild or medium), guacamole, cheese, and lettuce.\n  ","406847":"\n  i thought shakespeare's work was a bit pretentious and dramatic, but i did enjoy the process of analyzing his pieces and picking apart all of the metaphors.\n  ","406848":"\n  i would *much* rather learn to play every instrument !! i'm very passionate about music and it would fulfill me if i knew how to play multiple instruments, especially if i was proficient at them.\n  ","406849":"\n  the fact that i'm still living with my parents is holding me back from my true potential, my potential to be the happiest i can be at this stage of my life. i'm not living for myself right now even though i should be, i'm living to take care of my parents and it's been damaging to my mental health.\n  \n  however, my good friend asked me if i wanted to join him and his brother in looking for houses to rent, so i'm going to be meeting with him next week to discuss finances and details and whatnot. :'))\n  ","406850":"\n

the arts that was a revival of the classics. with respect to literature, neoclassicism was mostly in the form of essays and satires, as well as poetry. according to my google searches, neoclassicism in literature focused on man being inherently flawed, which is in contrast to the renaissance period of literature, in which man was seen as inherently good.\n  ","406854":"\n  if i don't have an

which i'm very proud of, but lately i've been really needing extra time off from work.\n  ","406859":"\n  i believe my greatest strength is my desire to help other people, especially in terms of mental health. for a few years now, i've tried to be an advocate for the awareness of mental health issues and support the destigmatization of disorders like depression, anxiety, personality disorders, psychosis, etc etc.\n  \n  ever since i started talking about mental health, i've had more and more people come up to me and tell me how i've ever helped them through a crisis or inspired them to take better care of their own health. it makes me feel amazing that i've been able to reach people in such a way.\n  ","406860":"\n  i'm proud of graduating from college. high school and college were both difficult times for me in terms of my mental health, and while i knew i was going to graduate from high school, i honestly didn't think i would do well in or graduate from college.\n  \n  even though i've always been a good student, my mental illnesses got in the way of a lot and i would often skip class, and my tendency to ab*se substances overrode my desire to go to class as well. often, i would party at night and skip my morning classes, but i would still do great on my exams and papers so i received mostly As.\n  ","406861":"\n  LOL, unfortunately that is definitely not that case. my writing is pristine, but my speaking voice, inflection, syntax, and just overall manner of speaking is absolutely terrible and hard to follow. i've always been horrible at speaking to other people, and i also have social anxiety. i could never work in a secretary or customer service position.\n  ","406862":"\n  i can't deny it, i do think about the future very often. it triggers anxiety in me somewhat, but it also gives me a source of hope, knowing that i could potentially be happier in the future and i just need to work towards it.\n  ","406863":"\n  i don't remember, tbh. especially since the last creative pieces i've written happened so long ago (the last essay i wrote was in january).\n  \n  however, i think that was sorta the last time i wrote for myself, not for

exists and it's not talked about as often as toxic masculinity. toxic feminity is tied into the traits of toxic masculinity, in which the standards of a male-dominated system are upheld by women ascribed to that system. this is classically seen in women, particularly white women, who put other women down for expressing themselves via s*x and other things that challenge the notion of a subservient woman.\n  ","406880":"\n  no, not really. everyone with whom i'm in contact are close friends of mine, and there isn't anyone with whom i want to improve contact. if that was the case,

in hobbies or taking trips. you're experiencing life to your fullest extent.\n  ","406883":"\n  that person should always be yourself. you cannot rely on other people to make you happy -- your

onto the topic of wifi (i think because with his new phone, he has a lot more coverage). for some reason, i thought he was asking me for his wifi password. and on his end, he thought i was asking him for his wifi password. so we both have our phones open and he says, \"ok, are you ready?\" and i go \"yes!\" and start reading out the password to him.\n  \n  he looks at me with a blank stare and he goes \"...why are you reading me the password? i thought you needed it.\" so i went, \"no, i thought *you* needed it.\" and he replies, \"... why would i need my own wifi password? i live here!\" then

stop trying then you won't get the help you need and deserve. it's so difficult to find places that take your insurance, but you should also keep in mind that even if a place doesn't take insurance, they may be able to help you on a sliding scale.\n  \n  also, oh jeez @ your mother. it isn't a scam, it's honestly because mental health isn't taken as seriously as physical health concerns and there's so much misconception revolved around even \"simpler\" mental illnesses like depression and anxiety. the same can be said for basically any invisible illness, too.\n  ","407163":"\n  i won't lie -- it *was* terrible in the beginning, especially considering how i was feeling during that time and how hopeless i felt because none of the medications i tried worked for me. but my former psychiatrist was amazing, she worked with me and saw me every 2 weeks and even gave me her cell phone number to make sure i was okay.\n  \n  you're right, though -- it's so difficult to find help and support with mental illness, especially when behavioral health care isn't taking seriously with a lot of insurance companies because they're somehow not deemed as \"necessary\" medical complaints. it's absolutely absurd.\n  ","407164":"\n  lol, no. that's actually pretty invalidating because that person isn't acknowledging your complaints or actually trying to help you. if they genuinely cared,

call like 5 different places in order to find a psychiatrist who was (1) taking my insurance, and (2) had availability and taking new patients.\n  \n  eventually after about two months or so, i found a psychiatrist in a counseling center who was taking on new patients and who was affordable because she took my insurance. i began seeing her and she diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder after maybe the third visit or so (the first visit was really just an intake evaluation). she prescribed me a different antidepressant because the one my general practitioner prescribed me wasn't working. and it just went on from there -- since that time, i've tried perhaps 10+ different medications to find a combination of meds that work for me.\n  \n  try

by two phases, mania and depression. BPD, on the other hand, can have a range of emotions (however, you *can* also experience some types of mania and also depression with BPD).\n  \n  -- bipolar disorder is primarily a chemical imbalance, while BPD is correlated to life events. i.e., an outburst from someone with bipolar disorder might just be related to their ups and downs, while an outburst from someone with BPD is a direct result of an environmental condition.\n  \n  -- BPD has a wider range of mood changes, i.e. anxiety, irritability, anger (which can borderline on rage), sadness, emptiness, dissociation, etc etc. bipolar disorder, on the other hand, is diagnosed after experiencing at least one two-week episode of mania (or hypomania) and then depression.\n  \n  -- episodes in bipolar disorder are much more longstanding than episodes in BPD, i.e. bipolar mania episodes can last 1-2 weeks or longer while episodes in BPD can last from minutes to days.\n  \n  if you have any other questions, please let

it would help me calm down.\n  \n  i actually quit for one year in between my freshman and sophomore year of college, because i had moved back to new york at that point and couldn't smoke because the

mood that day. i normally bring lunches to work with me so that i don't have to spend money on a meal, but occasionally i'll buy lunch on wednesdays because it's \"sushi day\" at the cafeteria in my office building.\n  \n  as for dinner, most of my meals are home-cooked but occasionally my family and i will order takeout.\n  ","407280":"\n  i have two best friends, one of which is my boyfriend.\n  ","407281":"\n  yes, ab*sive friendships are absolutely real, and they're not nearly as talked about as much as ab*sive relationships are. regardless of whether the relationship is romantic or platonic, there always needs to be boundaries set and mutual respect between each person. it's perfectly valid and okay to cease friendships with people whom you believe are being manipulative, ab*sive, etc etc.\n  ","407282":"\n  aw, i followed you !! ?\n  \n  everyone go follow livi's new page ~~\n  ","407283":"\n  oof, i hope that doesn't happen to me anytime soon. not that it really

my bedroom.\n  ","407287":"\n  like, five minutes ago. lmao.\n  \n  i went into the kitchen to get some ice, and my mother turned around to face me and gasped so loudly because she didn't expect me to be there. apparently, i walk very quietly and no one ever sees me coming. lmao.\n  ","407288":"\n  a few people come to mind, tbh. the one i'm most comfortable talking about is one of my coworkers though, lol. she *always* talks about herself and when a conversation isn't revolved around her or her experiences, she flat out walks away from us.\n  ","407289":"\n  i have no interest in making new friends, so no.\n  ","407290":"\n  some people have told me that i have a typical new york accent, lol. that was only when i was out of state, however. when i lived in massachusetts, my roommate and other college friends would always claim i had an accent.\n  ","407291":"\n  surprisingly, no. my phone is almost 4 years old, but it still holds a charge relatively well. i do still have to charge my phone once or twice per day, but if i'm not using it then the battery doesn't dwindle much at all.\n  ","407292":"\n  well, \"good\" is really subjective -- so one person may believe they're a good writer while someone else may not, regardless of their knowledge of grammar. obviously you can't judge someone's skills in writing based solely on their social media presence, you would have to look at their academic papers and whatnot to get a true idea of their grasp on punctuation.\n  \n  regardless, there are plenty of ways a person can improve themselves. normally reading how-to books with respect to writing correctly can be very helpful, as well as practicing writing and having someone nearby who can be an editor.\n  ","407293":"\n  no, not at all. there's nothing annoying or wrong about people learning a second (or third or fourth) language. if anything, it's admirable that they know a language other than their native tongue.\n  ","407294":"\n  nah, not really. it's just a mashup of the latin root words for \"poetry\" and \"moon.\"\n  ","407295":"\n  it usually only takes me 15 minutes to get ready in the morning. i just wake up, take my medication, get dressed, use the

a dream that my boyfriend's mother was still alive. she was in the hospital being wheeled onto the floor in a wheelchair, and me and my boyfriend and his father ran over to her and gave her a huge hug. i was worried she wouldn't remember me, and she went \"it's been nine years, you look so beautiful!\"\n  \n  i woke up and was heartbroken.\n  ","407298":"\n  i've never purposely hit anyone before.\n  ","407299":"\n  depending on my mood, i usually just browse the internet, watch television, hang out with friends, play video games, read, write, paint, or clean.\n  ","407300":"\n  a

the video, but i'm assuming it was about a bunch of parents fighting in the middle of the park, right ??\n  \n  if that's the case, then i think it's highly immature and inappropriate. not only are your own children watching you behave this way, which is further setting an example for them, but you're being watched by every other child and family in the park. disneyland is supposed to be a family fun, children-oriented theme park, so i think any sort of fighting is completely unnecessary and embarrassing.\n  ","407303":"\n  it would be easier for me to justify my mood swings if there was a genuine reason behind them, lol. but unfortunately, no -- nothing has really happened besides my brain going haywire.\n  \n  it happens every now and again. my mood swings are generally stable and mild, but every once in a while, they flare up for no apparent reason.\n  ","407304":"\n  right now, i'm feeling a bit anxious and flighty. i'm trying to calm myself down by listening to music, but it isn't really working very well. i might take hydroxyzine and see if that does anything to help.\n  ","407305":"\n  i've honestly been better. my mood swings have totally been erratic these past two days, ranging from last night's euphoria to this afternoon's anxiety-ridden and distracted sadness. i'm feeling a bit more stable at this current moment, but overall i've been somewhat of a mess.\n  ","407306":"\n  aw, that's amazing !! even just the instrumentals move me to tears sometimes.\n  ","407307":"\n  i'm not comfortable doing that because i was DM'ing a friend of mine on insta.\n  ","407308":"\n  well, my healthier coping mechanisms are lighting a candle and\/or burning incense while laying down, listening to calming music, distracting myself with a television show or movie, and venting to a friend.\n  \n  my unhealthy coping mechanisms are chain smoking and getting drunk.\n  ","407309":"\n  i guess the 30-minute phone conversation i had with my boyfriend yesterday, haha. we were just talking about what's going on in our lives, how our day was, his work schedule for the week, his upcoming camping trip, etc etc.\n  ","407310":"\n  answering questions, drinking coffee, and listening to music.\n  ","407311":"\n  i don't believe there are any topics that i dislike talking about, unless it's something that i'm not educated on because then there isn't anything i can really contribute to the conversation.\n  ","407312":"\n  i don't have any wild activities that i want to try, lol. my \"crazy\" days are far, far behind me. i'm looking for contentment

art, video games, music, and my close friendships\/relationships.\n  ","407317":"\n  yeah, i definitely believe so. if someone is *too* cheerful, then there's the potential that their optimism overshadows realistic outlooks on life, and they're basically living in an illusion as opposed to facing reality.\n  ","407318":"\n  mental health and mental illnesses. there's still a lot of stigma surrounding mental health, particularly regarding mental illnesses like bipolar disorder, BPD, psychotic disorders, dissociative disorders, etc etc. there are still so many people out there who think we can just \"snap out of it\" or that we're seeking attention for the hell of it.\n  \n  in reality, mental illnesses are serious disorders of the brain which often have physical components as well. they should be taken as seriously as physical illnesses instead of brushed away.\n  ","407319":"\n  i don't really have any secrets because my boyfriend & my therapist know basically everything about

that i wanted to write for a living, so that was something i strived toward.\n  ","407337":"\n  having the same interests as your partner is integral in a relationship, in my opinion. how can you

never explode into an actual argument anymore (although it did in the past). our relationship is very far from perfect.\n  ","407371":"\n  no, i don't judge people's pasts. my boyfriend has a checkered past himself, and i understand that he's a different person now and what's in the past is staying in the past. people make mistakes and learn from them, and as long as they recognize their behavior was hurtful and make amends to be a better person, then that past doesn't matter to me.\n  ","407372":"\n  i wouldn't lie about that -- so yes, really. it doesn't matter if you come off anon,

 i don't know much about elementary-aged children to begin with, so my opinion may be a bit uninformed. however, i believe lgbt+ relationships and gender identity should be introduced into curriculum during the middle school years, like around the ages of 10-14 or so. they're old enough at that point to understand what they're being taught and also to understand their own emotions and feelings toward the subject.\n  ","407401":"\n  it's quite common for ab*se survivors, actually. you were hurt by their actions, and perhaps even traumatized by them, and so as a result, you want to shut them out of your emotions, life, events, etc etc., because that shows vulnerability and you don't want your well being to be compromised again.\n  \n  i'm the exact same way. i don't key my family in to any aspect of my life at all, i'm shut off from my family emotionally, and i don't tell them anything about what's going on in my life besides big events (i.e., me getting my new job two years ago). i'm also very uncomfortable around and embarrassed by my parents, particularly my mother, so i totally empathize with your situation.\n  ","407402":"\n  the original rainbow flag should do the job just fine, lol. there are also flags for being gay, bi, lesbian, trans, non-binary, asexual, etc etc. i just personally believe the original rainbow flag encompasses everything.\n  ","407403":"\n  is this the one?\n  \n  seems like, according to google, the black and brown lines represent marginalized communities, and the rest of the new colors represent the trans community. i think it's good that it's more inclusive, but i also believe it's a bit unnecessary since they have their own flags as well.\n  ","407404":"\n  i didn't know about this. what did they update about it?\n  \n  i think it's fine the way it currently is, with the normal rainbow scheme. there are plenty of other flags for other orientations and identities. i believe the rainbow flag jut encompasses everything and is the \"umbrella\" flag for the entire lgbt+ community.\n  ","407405":"\n  i think it depends on the child, really. i'm not exactly well versed in children or child education, but i believe that perhaps they should be taught at around an \"older\" age, like 7 or 8 years old. or if the child expresses a gender identity that differs from their sex from an early age, they can be taught about gender at that age as well.\n  ","407406":"\n  my day has been going well. i woke up around 8am, made myself a cup of coffee, and ran a few errands before anyone else in the house woke up. after i came home, i made myself an iced coffee & since then, i've basically been listening to music and browsing the internet.\n  \n  later, i'm planning on re-attaching my clothes rack to my wall and hanging all of my

middle school, who introduced my boyfriend to me when we were in high school, ended our friendship after my boyfriend ended his friendship with her boyfriend (i hope this makes sense, lol). my boyfriend and her boyfriend were best friends, and when their friendship ended, she decided to cut me off entirely with no reason or explanation.\n  ","407414":"\n  i believe so, yes. if my boyfriend wanted to move to cuba, for example, i would be more than willing to learn spanish and cuban traditions. i already know a little bit of spanish through interacting with his family and have experienced a bit of the cuisine through my boyfriend's grandmother, and it would certainly be a learning experience to witness those traditions first-hand.\n  ","407415":"\n  true friendship, in my personal opinion, is having a friendship where both people care about each other equally and reach out during times of need. there's no vying for the other person's attention or affection, and you both can be

understand it very much but it generally seems like it refers to the collusion of government officials with influential people in various industries to put forth policies and ideas whose true intentions are hidden from the general public?\n  \n  if that's the case, then yes.\n  ","407418":"\n  i firmly believe that the government knows about the existence of extraterrestrial lifeforms and is actively hiding it from the general public.\n  ","407419":"\n  answering questions, listening to music, and drinking an iced coffee.\n  ","407420":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree. years ago, although i struggled with depression, i basically didn't want to help myself because i thought i was so deep in the hole that there wasn't any worth for me to seek out help. it ended up making my mental illness worse, and i really didn't realize that until it was almost too late.\n  ","407421":"\n  some people can break out of those negative thought patterns, yes. it takes a lot of self-talk, soul searching, and acknowledgment that your thoughts are toxic in order to really get over your own prejudice. it's entirely possible to break free from problematic perspectives against communities (whether it's the lgbt+, black, asian, or spanish communities, etc etc.).\n  \n  i think it's easier when people are younger, because when you're older it becomes so conditioned within you that it's difficult to really escape from those prejudices.\n  ","407422":"\n  if i like someone, it's regardless of their skin color. my boyfriend has light skin despite the fact that he's spanish.\n  ","407423":"\n  she's going to have to *want* to exercise in order for her to begin exercising -- you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do. and generally, people with mental illness react negatively to the stereotypical response of \"exercise will help!\"\n  \n  sometimes exercising takes away the depression temporarily, but it isn't a cure-all. if anything, it's something that distracts people with mental illness from their feelings. it doesn't actually help or cure the depression. however, everyone is different.\n  ","407424":"\n  most people comment on how colorful and great my hair is, haha.

no, i believe that's a common misconception that arises out of a patriarchal society where women have always been seen as \"in hysteria\" and men were revered for being the logical, rational type to make the greater decisions.\n  \n  in reality, women and men are equally as irrational, and men are actually just as emotional -- this also stems from toxic masculinity, because men have been conditioned to suppress their emotions because it's seen as \"weak\" for men to show emotion.\n  ","407427":"\n  i wouldn't have started self-h*rming when i was a pre-teen and i would have tried to be more open to therapy, because at that time i was dealing with a lot of complex mental health issues.\n  ","407428":"\n  i would assume probably within the next 100-150 years. i don't really have much

nodding while saying \"no\" or looking off to the side while speaking.\n  \n  -- hiding their mouth or eyes while speaking.\n  \n  -- gulping or swallowing before answering a question or speaking.\n  \n  -- hand-to-face activity, i.e. picking at the lips, scratching the head, pulling on the ears, etc etc. it means their anxiety has been triggered.\n  \n  -- adjusting their shirt, fixing their

taking over my life.\n  \n  i actually had a dream the other night that my coworker and i went to a party together, and she asked me to grab a gun from her car and keep it in the back of my pants in case anything bad happened. i was hiding it from people, obviously.\n  \n  when i woke up, i told my coworker about the dream & she looked up what it means, and apparently hiding a gun in a dream means that i'm suppressing feelings of anger. which ... isn't really untrue, haha.\n  ","407433":"\n  in general, i try not to regret things in my life. i believe that it's useless and harmful to focus on past events and wonder what you could have done differently, because there isn't anything you can do to change them now. you can only accept them for what they are and move on.\n  \n

higher-up than other people because they have money, or are attractive, or own a nice car, or have a nice job, etc etc. no one is inherently better than anyone else and it's sickening and unappealing

(like my early teen years), i would sort of adopt rowling's writing style but create my own stories, which at that time was mainly fan fiction. i also read a lot of stephen king's books and anne rice's books & enjoyed their descriptive style, so i also tried adopting those styles and emulated them in my own writing, during a time when i was trying to find my own unique voice.\n  \n  eventually i branched out from adopting other people's styles, and as i got older, my writing matured. i still don't have an established voice per say because my style does change slightly depending on what i'm writing, but now i definitely know how to write things according to my own perspectives while maintaining my own voice.\n  ","407440":"\n  i need to read books because alongside the voice

rooted in your own insecurities and beauty standards. that's the first step in acknowledging negative thought patterns and reversing them, or getting over them to create more positive thought patterns.\n  \n  honestly, it doesn't surprise me that you feel this way. there's such stigma and discrimination against black people and latino people, especially when they have biracial children and your hope that your child appears white is just a product of that stigma. you're afraid that they're going to be discriminated against or teased for being a mixture of black, white, and latino.\n  \n  but, you have to eventually realize that when you become a mother, your child(ren) will be the most beautiful things to you. perhaps you simply need to mature more, but coming from my experiences with my friends who have kids, any insecurity regarding their appearance disappears after they're born because you develop such an intimate connection with your child during pregnancy. at that point, you just want to provide what's best for them.\n  \n  as for what to do ... there really isn't much for you to physically do in this instance. it's just a matter of you thinking about why you have these thoughts to begin with and try to work on overcoming them.\n  ","407522":"\n  no, i haven't done art in quite a long time. the last time i attempted to paint or anything was a few months ago, but i

because it's endangerment to the health of other people. it's a really serious matter.\n  ","407531":"\n  customers.\n  ","407532":"\n  there's this new trend apparently where people like ... use grocery items or lick items or something, and then put them back on the shelves. it's disgusting.\n  ","407533":"\n  either they have something to give me, or they have a crush on me, haha. either way i'm not particularly interested.\n  ","407534":"\n  absolutely disgusting -- i'm pretty sure it's also against the law. as someone who comes from a retail environment, it's an incredibly disservice to the store and those who work in that store because of shrink percentages.\n  ","407535":"\n  ???\n  ","407536":"\n  see a therapist.\n  ","407537":"\n  i don't really think it's these days, i believe it's always been that way with people and relationships. a lot of people are either afraid of or not interested in commitment.\n  \n  as for your situation, depending on how close you are and\/or how long you've been dating, perhaps you should tell your partner how you feel. just because it's long distance doesn't mean the relationship is less valid.\n  ","407538":"\n  i finally remembered to grab my DSLR camera from my best friend's mother's house, LOL. i want to go out and take more photos now.\n  ","407539":"\n  she lives somewhere near keene, i believe !! she's always posting photos of cute towns and hiking trails and whatnot.\n  ","407540":"\n  yesterday morning. i was hungover when i woke up.\n  ","407541":"\n  no, but being an assh*le does.\n  ","407542":"\n  that's a very high and inaccurate percentage, lmao. you'll find a girlfriend, don't stress out about it.\n  ","407543":"\n  i'm seeing my best friend since she came back to new york for the weekend.\n  ","407544":"\n  yeah, it's pretty much the same here too. lmao, one time when i was working at the drug store, my coworker brought in one of those bags and just smoked from the bag instead of putting the cigarettes in like an empty pack. i was like ... wut.\n  ","407545":"\n  ugh, that's so terrible. if he's dead set in his ways, i really don't know what you could say to him that would convince him otherwise -- especially if you tried everything already.\n  \n  perhaps your mom\/stepmom\/whoever can try to talk to him about it, if she's also bothered by it?\n  ","407546":"\n  i write every day at work, so honestly by the time i get home, i'm exhausted and my brain turns to mush, haha. i haven't written anything creatively in quite a while.\n  ","407547":"\n  aahh, that's so unhealthy. i'm so sorry you have to deal with that !! even though i'm a smoker, i would *never* smoke inside the house or inside anyone else's house, it's just disgusting. the chemicals from the smoke stains everything and leaves every object with the terrible scent.\n  \n  if you haven't tried before, maybe explain second hand smoke to him and indicate that you don't want to get health problems just because he smokes? ideally, he should be more considerate of you since you're his child and your health is at risk.\n  ","407548":"\n  holyyyyyy crap !! that's more expensive that new york city.\n  \n  yeah, i totally need to go to the reservations because cartons of their own brand of cigarettes are really cheap.\n  ","407549":"\n  jesus christ, lmao. that's so ridiculous.\n  ","407550":"\n  yeah, probably. he has a hell of a memory, much better than my own memory. honestly, he would be the one to bring it up first because i would have forgotten that i said it in the first place.\n  ","407551":"\n  wtf is a sin tax ?! we get taxed on cigarettes too so most times, two packs of cigarettes costs me like $21.\n  ","407552":"\n  i'm honestly not sure. i think it depends on the company, whether or not they would ask. either way, if they discriminate against you or don't give you a job simply because you took a few years off to focus on your health, they're not a good company to work for.\n  \n  also, you're not obligated to get into specifics if they do ask. you can simply say it was for health reasons.\n  ","407553":"\n  definitely not, lmao. that's pretty much an omen that the relationship is going to fail.\n  ","407554":"\n  aw, you too !!\n  ","407555":"\n  yeah, we have drifted apart. that doesn't mean i don't care about her anymore, though. and she's helped me a lot throughout my life and helped me cope with the trauma i endured when i was a teenager, so even though we don't talk often anymore, she's still important to me.\n  ","407556":"\n  considering it takes me 45 minutes to an hour to drive to work every day, going to mastic doesn't seem so terrible, LOL. i just haven't had the motivation to go.\n  ","407557":"\n  not at all. i don't regret any of my tattoos because they were super meaningful to me at one point in my life, and most of them still hold meaning because they represent me, my life, and my friends\/relationship.\n  ","407558":"\n  yeah, the one everyone i know goes to is the one in mastic. which honestly isn't a terrible drive -- the other one is in southampton, which is hard to get to.\n  ","407559":"\n  i mean ... we sorta are, LOL. the only justification is if we go to the reservations, which i've been meaning to do lately because a carton is like $25.\n  ","407560":"\n  ugh, smh. i mean -- if i lived there, i would probably never quit, lmao. i just looked up cigarette prices by state & apparently they're less than $6 in kentucky and alabama.\n  ","407561":"\n  OMG I KNOW. it's the same in queens too !! i mean, cigarettes are already expensive on long island compared to other places, but in the city, it's absolutely ridiculous.\n  ","407562":"\n  yeah, that's my ultimate goal actually. i was thinking of checking out north carolina or virginia.\n  ","407563":"\n  yeah, i've definitely had that happen to me multiple times before. i would absolutely hate living, or even working, in the city because of how congested everything is. also it's expensive af, i think even more expensive than long island.\n  ","407564":"\n  no, at the last second she claimed she was feeling \"fine\" and stayed until the regular time we normally leave. we think it was because my other coworker did catch her in the bathroom and saw she was fine.\n  \n  this wouldn't be the first time she's lied to our faces about sh*t, though. she's generally a very sneaky and manipulative person and we've caught her in lies before.\n  ","407565":"\n  things i like about new york city ;\n  \n  -- all of the things to do and opportunities to see, i.e. restaurants, plays, and museums.\n  \n  -- everything is open until late at night.\n  \n  -- hot dog and halal vendors on the street. they literally have the best food.\n  \n  things i dislike about new york city ;\n  \n  -- how crowded everything is. you barely have room to walk half the time.\n  \n  -- the commute via train to the city. it's expensive and annoying.\n  \n  -- the smell. most people don't know about it, but everything smells like hot garbage.\n  ","407566":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry.\n  ","407567":"\n  my coworker lied straight to my face about feeling sick in order for her to leave work early. she claimed she was vomiting in the bathroom at work, but when my other coworker went there to check up on her, she was leaning against the wall just looking at her phone. she didn't wash her hands or her face, which is normally what someone would do had they been vomiting like she said she was.\n  \n  it was a beautiful day outside & all morning she was complaining that she didn't want to be at work and all she wanted to do was go in her friend's pool. so me and my other coworkers (a few of us are in a group chat together) think that she lied just so she could leave early and hang out with her friend.\n  ","407568":"\n  it's no problem at all !! i hope you have a great day & weekend, my friend.\n  ","407569":"\n  i would rather go to a small gathering. big parties are definitely not my scene, especially because of my sensory issues and social anxiety.\n  ","407570":"\n  sometimes, LOL. at times, it's easier to get involved in tasks with multiple steps when you walk them through out loud to yourself.\n  ","407571":"\n  ... why am i doing those things? obviously because i want to.\n  ","407572":"\n  yes, i love avocados & guacamole. i actually have an avocado tattoo on my ankle, lmao (it also symbolizes my friendship with my best friend, since we both love avocados).\n  ","407573":"\n  (cont) ... want to find love but I kind of think it\u2019s impossible for anyone to love me. :(\n  \n  --\n  \n  i understand that too, about the whole best friend thing. honestly, my best friend and i have drifted apart ever since she moved to another state, and i don't tell her anything about my family and struggles because i either don't want to burden her or i feel like a broken record, always complaining about the same exact thing over & over again.\n  \n  as for your second statement -- you seem like a beautiful, compassionate person and i guarantee that you will find love one day. you're young and you have your whole life ahead of you, and there is definitely someone that exists who will accept you for all that you are, struggles and all.\n  ","407574":"\n  i'm currently answering questions on askfm, listening to music, and drinking an iced coffee.\n  ","407575":"\n  i'm feeling pretty good today, actually. i got a terrific amount of sleep & i didn't drink alcohol last night, so i woke up feeling refreshed. i forgot how good i felt in the morning on nights that i'm sober, and i'm actively trying to continue on this path.\n  \n  i'm currently drinking coffee (what else is new?) and waiting for my best friend to text me back. she's back in new york for the weekend & we're planning on seeing each other.\n  ","407576":"\n  ugh, i feel this completely. i'm also looking to move out but it's nearly impossible considering how expensive everything is around my area (i live in new york). my therapist, my boyfriend and i all agree that my mental health would be 100x more stable if i lived independently and didn't have to deal with my family on a daily basis. i could finally be in control of my own life and do things on my own time without having to worry about my family judging me.\n  \n  also, no problem at all !! i'm glad i was able to help. just remember that i'm always here if you need to rant, we're in very similar situations so i sympathize completely. xx\n  ","407577":"\n  this is a pretty difficult situation to be in, so if you're currently experiencing this, then i empathize with you. :\/\n  \n  really, you're just going to have to be upfront and honest with you. space out a time where you two can both sit down and have a discussion, and then explain to her what she's been doing, how it's been making you feel, how it's (possibly) been hurting her or you or the people around her, and provide support for her if she's willing to recognize these patterns and change.\n  \n  be sure to identify that you don't think anything less of her or that you don't want to be her friend anymore. tell her you care about her immensely and that's why you feel the need to have this conversation. you want what's best for her.\n  ","407578":"\n  it depends on who's trying to tease me about my body. most of the time, i try not to let it bother me because ultimately other people's comments are worthless and insignificant. if they don't like the way i look, then good for them -- they're not in control of my body or live in it every day, so their opinion is ultimately invalid.\n  ","407579":"\n  yes, i believe that's possible. look at polyamorous people, for example -- they date and love multiple people at the same time, which leads me to believe that a lot of people have the capability of distinguishing various forms of love and applying them to different people in their lives.\n  \n  you can be in love two different people for two very different reasons. humans are naturally complex creatures, and love isn't necessarily reserved for only one person in our lives.\n  ","407580":"\n  oh, hell no. why is a water bottle that expensive ?! lmaoo.\n  \n  granted, i do like water bottles and use them at home and at work. but the most i've spent was like $25 on one of those yeti bottles that keeps drinks cold for two days.\n  ","407581":"\n  followed !! xx\n  \n  also -- if any of my followers are looking for new people to follow, joanna is an absolute doll. :'))\n  ","407582":"\n  i'm so sorry you're dealing with this. :\/ honestly -- i've endured the same exact thing my entire life, so i understand completely how you feel. i also feel like i walk on eggshells around my family, particularly my mother, because she can change at any given second. she gives off the impression that she's a kind person, when really she feigns for sympathy 24\/7 and turns everything around to be a pillar against her. it also doesn't help that she's physically disabled, because that means my father and i have to do everything around the house for her, which includes her barking orders at us constantly.\n  \n  in the beginning, i didn't deal with it well at all. i'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and BPD. for a very long time, i turned to self-h*rm to deal with my problems and attempted s*icide a few times. even though i'm clean from SH now, i still have urges every day and i've relapsed every so often. as i got older, i turned to drugs & alcohol. i'm still battling with my dependence on alcohol because it was only very recently revealed to me how much of a problem it was. needless to say, my coping mechanisms aren't healthy.\n  \n  however -- therapy and medication has helped me a lot. not only in dealing with my moods and whatnot, but also for developing coping mechanisms and changes in thought patterns related to what i'm going through with my family. talking to a therapist about what happens at home has been really beneficial to me, and if it's possible for you, i suggest you do the same. it's integral to find someone who listens. understands, and is on your side.\n  \n  i hope this all helps. xx\n  ","407583":"\n  this is the last selfie i took ;\n  ","407584":"\n  this reminds me of high school when we would have to say the word \"organism\" in a sentence in science class & we would be so terrified of accidentally saying \"org*sm.\" lmao.\n  ","407585":"\n  haha, no. i've never done that before.\n  ","407586":"\n  no, but i do drink coffee every day (lately iced coffee).\n  ","407587":"\n  i would rather have new clothing. my phone works perfectly fine & i don't need a new one.\n  ","407588":"\n  aahh, i have so many !! i don't think i can choose just one.\n  \n  the x files, criminal minds, NCIS, castle, bones, ghost adventures, ghost hunters, paranormal lockdown, ghost brothers, bob's burgers, bojack horseman, big mouth, parks and recreation, how i met your mother, and supernatural.\n  ","407589":"\n  i either sleep in the fetal position with one arm under the pillow and one leg bent, or on my back.\n  ","407590":"\n  i think i look more like my dad. we have similar facial features.\n  ","407591":"\n  aesthetic photo of my wine date last night ~~\n  ","407592":"\n  \"good as

peace when i'm in the water, and i remember when i was young i used to hold my breath for as long as possible and just sit on the bottom of the pool, taking in the underwater silence. it was relaxing.\n  ","407594":"\n  the first band i was ever interested in was linkin park when i was 11 years old. their music spoke to me and really triggered my love and passion for music as a whole. i still listen to them to this day.\n  ","407595":"\n  i would take a road trip to montreal, canada, with my boyfriend. :')) when we were driving upstate to the wedding two weeks ago, we were only maybe 200 miles away from montreal. we talked about it, and it's definitely something we want to do one day.\n  ","407596":"\n  yes, i'm a very loyal friend and would never reveal someone's secret to anyone else. i wouldn't want someone to do it to me, so why would i do it to someone who considers me a friend ??\n  ","407597":"\n  yesterday, haha. my coworker straight up lied to my face about something & she had no shame. she texted me and a few other coworkers (we're all in a group chat together), saying she was projectile vomiting in the bathroom. so my one coworker went to the bathroom to check up on her, and she was literally just standing against the wall on her phone.\n  \n  honestly, we think she was trying to create a back story with us so that she could email HR and try to leave early. all she was saying in the morning was that she didn't want to work and just wanted to go in her friend's pool. guaranteed she was trying to make plans to leave.\n  ","407598":"\n  this is a picture of me from around 2010\/2011 -- my boyfriend and i visited the central park zoo with a 35mm camera, and he snapped this shot of me. :'))\n  ","407599":"\n  honestly, i think only once -- and that's with my current boyfriend. my previous relationships conjured feelings of joy and happiness, but they didn't make me feel nearly as strong as i feel about my boyfriend.\n  ","407600":"\n  girl interrupted by susanna kaysen. it's an autobiographical sketch of the author's in-patient stay in a psychiatric facility after a s*icide attempt, and it was really eye opening regarding mental illness in general. it was my first real introduction to mental health.\n  ","407601":"\n  i would visit my best friend who lives in new hampshire. the area she lives in looks absolutely beautiful.\n  ","407602":"\n  no, that would absolutely be counter-productive. yelling at a child isn't going to make them learn a lesson, it's only going to encourage them to act out more. ideally, sitting down with your child and explaining to them why their behavior is wrong or dangerous and how it can affect them, and also providing support if necessary, would be the best course of action.\n  \n  however, every child is different. what works for some may not work for others. from my personal experience, getting yelled at as a child only made me more volatile, aggressive, and careless. it taught me that i couldn't trust my parents so i completely shut myself off from them.\n  ","407603":"\n  you can do an educational or informative vlog regarding a subject you're passionate about that other people may not know about.\n  ","407604":"\n  for the most part, yes. your own happiness is ultimately the most important, but i also do understand that a lot of people are more willing to help others rather than help themselves (which i do the same thing too).\n  \n  simply put, you will not be able to have a successful, longstanding relationship with someone unless you understand that you need to actively work on improving yourself -- otherwise the other person will become frustrated, because people are supposed to grow together. by not helping yourself, you're doing not only yourself a disservice, but also those around you.\n  ","407605":"\n  not at all !! i thoroughly enjoy your questions. you're doing a wonderful job.\n  ","407606":"\n  this picture always makes me happy because i took it on one of my favorite vacations to montauk, new york. :'))\n  ","407607":"\n  i honestly have no idea who's running. i haven't done any research on the upcoming candidates.\n  ","407608":"\n  i wouldn't say that

alcohol and smoke cigarettes.\n  ","407619":"\n  not very often these days !! usually i skip between feeling nothing & then feeling everything and then some, but lately i've been pretty content with everything.\n  ","407620":"\n  unless this is referring to something in the media that i don't know about, i'm going to assume you mean neon-colored light fixtures. in that case, i like them a lot. i

keeps me stable for the most part.\n  ","407624":"\n  honestly, i have really bad driving anxiety and that's partially because of the accidents i've been in. no matter how cautious i am, i know that i can't control over drivers so i'm always on high alert.\n  \n  i also have a really bad story about a car accident my boyfriend was in, but i don't want to scare you guys more, lmao.\n  ","407625":"\n

nightclubs either, lmao.\n  \n  during those days, i was a delinquent or criminal, and a borderline alcoholic. i drank every night of the week, did illegal things with my friends, and somehow found a

right forearm, as well as a traditional style dagger on the back of my right arm.\n  ","407628":"\n  i have seven tattoos.\n  ","407629":"\n  it's a little inconvenient but we've gotten used to it.

especially now it would be virtually impossible -- we rarely get to play all together these days due to everyone's conflicting work schedules.\n  ","407631":"\n  i totally understand that, that's happened to me every time i've gotten into an accident too. most recently, a work van rear ended my car and pushed me 20 feet forward, totally destroyed the back of my car.\n  \n  the other bad accident i was in happened quite a few years ago, some old man drove right through a stop sign without stopping and i didn't have enough time to swerve out of the way, so i ended up t-boning his car and totaled my car as a result.\n  ","407632":"\n  nah, we don't stream. we've always talked about it though -- especially when his friends are involved, the gameplay and conversations are always hilarious.\n  ","407633":"\n  my boyfriend and i are going to play far cry 5 tonight, it's what we played last night as well.\n  ","407634":"\n  lol, it happens sometimes. i've been in accidents every now & again, as well as my best friend and my boyfriend. my best friend actually had a similar experience -- she was driving down the parkway and her tire completely blew out, which made her swerve and hit a guard rail. thankfully she was fine.\n  ","407635":"\n  i haven't actually ran long distance in a *very* long time, lmao. i go in short spurts and then go back to power walking.\n

cheesecake.\n  ","407654":"\n  mainly first person shooters and open world RPGs. my favorite games are fallout 4 and skyrim, although i also play assassin's creed, destiny, far cry, minecraft, bioshock, and a few others.\n  ","407655":"\n  my paternal grandparents are, yes.\n  ","407656":"\n  i've honestly just been working, although i haven't worked on the weekend in the past three weeks, which is a bittersweet feeling, haha. i got my hair done two weekends ago, last weekend i went to a wedding, and this past weekend i just wanted to relax.\n  ","407657":"\n  no, i'm still relatively young so aging isn't a concern of mine.\n  ","407658":"\n  i never had a punk phase to begin with, lol.\n  ","407659":"\n  we had a mutual friend, someone who i went to middle school with and then went to the high school my boyfriend went to. we went out all together one night and him and i hit it off immediately.\n  ","407660":"\n  no, i'm growing my hair out.\n  ","407661":"\n  depends how interested i am in the game and the DLC. i have a few games that i like playing, but i probably wouldn't want to spend money on a DLC because they cost just as much as a regular game at this point.\n  ","407662":"\n  something that i'm not really comfortable talking about on askfm anymore.\n  ","407663":"\n  last night, i ate some pork with a side of broccoli with cheese sauce.\n  ","407664":"\n  LOL. to be fair, they've changed their logo a lot over the years.\n  ","407665":"\n  i rock back & forth when i'm feeling anxious or overwhelmed and it calms me down. it's actually a very common coping mechanism. i don't really know the actual science behind it, but it *is* comforting to a lot of people.\n  ","407666":"\n  you'll have to be more specific. which messages are you talking about ??\n  ","407667":"\n  it's ok !! it's the symbol for the band linkin park. :'))\n  ","407668":"\n  i play video games, but nothing on the phone.\n  ","407669":"\n  not really, no. feel free to ask me questions, though ~~\n  ","407670":"\n  yeah, june went by super fast for me !! i suppose the highlight was my cousin's wedding last weekend, but i also got my hair colored the weekend before that, so that was a highlight too. :'))\n  ","407671":"\n  no, thankfully i've never had acne. occasionally i'll get pimples on my face but it isn't very often.\n  ","407672":"\n  no, i've never made my own before. i just buy hummus from the store, normally sabre brand.\n  ","407673":"\n  yeah, you used \"frequently\" correctly.\n  \n  however, it should be \"she and i...\" not \"her and i...\" in the beginning of the sentence.\n  ","407674":"\n  sorta, but not really. school was my escape from my home life, but at the same time, i didn't have many friends and i rarely saw anyone outside of school. i studied and worked hard most of the time because i wanted to get into a good college & leave.\n  ","407675":"\n  how much i managed to clean today despite waking up hungover from last night. i did two loads of laundry, dusted and vacuumed the living room and dining room, wiped down all of my furniture in my room, vacuumed my room, reorganized my belongings, and put fresh sheets and pillowcases on the bed.\n  ","407676":"\n  linkin park. their discography is pretty diverse and they have a hell of a lot of songs, haha.\n  ","407677":"\n  mcdonalds, if i had to choose between the two. they have pretty good coffee.\n  ","407678":"\n  i honestly have no clue. i graduated from high school 10 years ago.\n  ","407679":"\n  yeah, i'm my hardest critic.\n  ","407680":"\n  definitely not, haha. i don't really wear eyeliner unless i'm *trying* to do a wing, but i usually fail miserably.\n  ","407681":"\n  life has been all right, it's had its normal ups & downs like usual. i'm currently feeling pretty good rn actually, i have a lot of motivation so i've been cleaning for like four hours.\n  ","407682":"\n  no, i've only been triggered on rare occasions, usually in things like television shows or movies. it has to be pretty graphic though.\n  ","407683":"\n  i don't really follow anyone on other social media besides my friends & a few youtubers, lol. i follow a lot of the cast and crew from rooster teeth\/achievement hunter, as well as gamers such as markiplier and jacksepticeye.\n  ","407684":"\n  LOL. i'll promote la croix any day, it's legit the only way i'll drink water. polar sparkling water is good too.\n  ","407685":"\n  the lord of the rings trilogy. i can watch them endlessly.\n  ","407686":"\n  depends on how your eagerness affects you. if it's putting you at a disadvantage, then it's a flaw. however, if it empowers you, then it's a positive attribute.\n  ","407687":"\n  la croix sparkling water !! i've been cleaning nonstop since 12pm and it's been keeping me hydrated, & it tastes great. :'))\n  ","407688":"\n  no. just because you believe in something doesn't mean that it's necessarily true. a lot of people believe in things that are generally inaccurate or false.\n  ","407689":"\n  no, he wasn't in the army. he actually wanted to go so badly, but he couldn't for medical reasons.\n  ","407690":"\n  no, although he does have depressive tendencies due to his PTSD.\n  ","407691":"\n  i already planned my next tattoo. it's going to be a writing quill & i'm putting it on my right forearm.\n  ","407692":"\n  sushi, even though i ate it last wednesday. lmao. i can always go for some sushi.\n  ","407693":"\n  no, i don't like the way watches look on me.\n  ","407694":"\n  sure, that sounds like fun. :'))\n  ","407695":"\n  going on askfm, lmao.\n  ","407696":"\n  uh, i don't even know what that is. lmao.\n  ","407697":"\n  you're asking the wrong person, my friend.\n  ","407698":"\n  i wouldn't use the terms hateful or bigoted, but i would consider them to be fairly closeminded and ignorant. it's perfectly acceptable and very progressive to teach children about different s*xual orientations and genders, and it leads to further tolerance, understanding and acceptance later in life.\n  ","407699":"\n  nothing makes me blush. i'm not really ashamed to talk about anything & i'm very hard to embarrass.\n  ","407700":"\n  i'd be pissed, obviously. i would contact my insurance company & see if it's covered.\n  ","407701":"\n  sometimes pop, but mostly rap. it doesn't stop my mind, though. lol.\n  ","407702":"\n  i'm not really a big fan of horror movies.\n  ","407703":"\n  depends on what the secret is and who the person was who was keeping it from me.\n  ","407704":"\n  it could lead to s*x addiction if someone is replacing actual coping mechanisms with the act of s*x. they become dependent on the actual feeling of an org*sm.\n  ","407705":"\n  i have rudimentary knowledge, sure.\n  ","407706":"\n  no, i haven't heard of that study. that's an interesting perspective, though.\n  ","407707":"\n  you mean through s*x ??\n  \n  probably not. i wouldn't want him to feel obligated to have s*x, and the act of having s*x does not make someone less depressed. he's still going to feel the same way when it's over, and he may even adopt feelings of guilt because he may not enjoy it. if my boyfriend was depressed, i would sit down and talk to him about his feelings and make a plan to try to make him feel better, whether that's through medication or therapy or finding new hobbies that are healthy.\n  ","407708":"\n  i'm a bit split on affirmative action because it has both pros and cons. on the one hand, i do agree that disadvantaged groups should be allowed to have the same treatment as advantaged groups due to historical background, it's sorta like making up for lost time. however, at the same time, it could lead to preferential treatment, i.e. colleges trying to meet a quota regarding percentages of students who are from minority groups.\n  \n  in addition, affirmative action leads people to suppress themselves and view themselves as disadvantaged more. while it's healthy to understand the history of oppression and discrimination, it may lead people to not want to progress further and see beyond their lack of advantage. they may not want to better themselves anymore because they see it as part of their identity.\n  ","407709":"\n  i'm not an expert on s*x, so i honestly don't know, lol.\n  ","407710":"\n  i haven't had the time or the inspiration. normally when i get home from work, i'm totally burnt out from writing all day so i just want to relax.\n  ","407711":"\n  again, it depends on the person. some people have s*x in healthy manners and it gives them a sense of intimacy with their partner. however, other times it's an unhealthy coping mechanism for some people.\n  ","407712":"\n  occasionally, but it's been quite a few months since i've written poetry.\n  ","407713":"\n  it depends on the person. you can't really quantify something like that as a whole because each person has their own comfort levels regarding s*x and what they deem to be often enough in their own lives.\n  ","407714":"\n  they're welcome if they insist on it, but i don't invite anyone over to my house. if i'm seeing a friend, i always either meet them out somewhere or go to their house.\n  ","407715":"\n  i have no opinions on it. it's just a clothing item.\n  ","407716":"\n  depends on the day. usually i'll have two large cups of coffee in the morning on the weekends, while during the week i'll only have one cup in the morning and then one cup in the afternoon.\n  ","407717":"\n  i posted a picture of my tattoos last night, if you feel like scrolling.\n  \n  i have them on my shoulder blades, my upper and lower arm, the top of my thigh, the back of my calf, my ankle, and my ribs.\n  ","407718":"\n  i've never heard her music before.\n  ","407719":"\n  no, i've actually never tried before.\n  ","407720":"\n  lol, no. all of my tattoos are visible and everyone knows about them.\n  ","407721":"\n  for some people, yeah. it's never bothered me though.\n  ","407722":"\n  \"you must move through pain if you wish to be happy, for he who stands still, feels the full force of misery.\"\n  ","407723":"\n  no, it's the same as it's always been. i'm not putting any effort into improving relations because i honestly don't care enough.\n  ","407724":"\n  yeah, but they have to acknowledge that they can improve and that what they're currently doing isn't good. however, outsiders cannot change their loved ones, friends, etc etc. to try to do so would be manipulative.\n  ","407725":"\n  i can't even imagine myself one month from now, let alone one year. lmao. i could be completely different with perhaps greater confidence, or i could be the same as i am today. it all depends on what i've gone through or accomplished within the next year.\n  ","407726":"\n  when they won't acknowledge that what they're doing is wrong or hurtful, have no desire to change, and aren't putting in any effort into the relationship or friendship.\n  ","407727":"\n  i'm absolutely terrible at both, lmao. however, that doesn't stop me from playing. pool is one of my favorite games, especially if there's a pool table at the bar.\n  ","407728":"\n  any time my boyfriend and i have gone on a small weekend vacation are wonderful moments. we don't have responsibilities for once in our lives, and we can do what we please with no restrictions. we normally go to upstate new york or montauk, new york.\n  ","407729":"\n  i would likely either move abroad or go down south to perhaps north carolina. i would probably have a similar job as what i have now, which is a writer & editor for a publishing company, where i could write articles and press releases as well as help in publishing items. that, or i would settle down and try to be a published author.\n  \n  i imagine having a small, quaint house with a lot of windows and wood furnishings. there would be plants and animals everywhere, and it would be a place where my friends could come if they have nowhere else to go. i would like my future home to sorta have an \"open door\" policy because i would want others to feel comfortable.\n  ","407730":"\n  yeah, i got kicked out of a wal-mart once because my friend stole something, so we were asked to leave. i'm not sure if we were necessarily banned from there, but still i haven't gone back, haha. this was years ago.\n  ","407731":"\n  i'm not really a hermit, no. i usually see my friends once per week, and occasionally i'll go to parties but it's rather rare because they only happen on holidays really; i.e., my coworker threw a fourth of july party last night & i went, it was actually pretty fun.\n  ","407732":"\n  yes, for the most part. i'm slowly working towards my dreams & goals, because unfortunately they aren't an overnight thing. sometimes the process can be a bit daunting or worrisome, but it's absolutely worth it in the end.\n  ","407733":"\n  leigh means \"dweller by the wood or clearing.\"\n  ","407734":"\n  hearing a loved one laugh or seeing them smile; immersing yourself in nature; having the first cup of coffee of the day; having a sense of accomplishment and pride when you did well on something you were previously worried about; receiving positive reinforcement from a trusted friend, family member or colleague; and being listened to and validated.\n  ","407735":"\n  one of my coworkers who's been pissing me off asked if i wanted to hang out today, so i lied and told her it was laundry day so i wouldn't be able to see her. lmao.\n  ","407736":"\n  there's quite a few of us !!\n  ","407737":"\n  another tattoo, lmao. i haven't gotten around to making an appointment or a consultation yet, though. i know which artist i want to do the tattoo, her work is amazing.\n  ","407738":"\n  i don't know if this is considered mexican food, but i love classic rice & beans, as well as empanadas. my boyfriend's grandmother makes amazing empanadas and her rice & beans are so delicious. every time she makes them all, she ends up making a huge batch that lasts my boyfriend and me two days.\n  ","407739":"\n  i'm not close to my family at all, tbh. the person i'm closest to is perhaps my brother, but we don't generally speak to each other unless we're at a family event.\n  "}}
