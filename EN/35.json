Very rich in tasting.\n  \n  But I love a gumbo. Of any kind.\n  \n  Broccoli cheddar soup is delicious!\n  \n  Potato celery soup is good.\n  \n  Shrimp and corn soup is probably one of my most favorite because you can put many different types of cream of soups in it to make it flavorful. I like to make this soup real thick\n  \n  Chicken and dumpling soup is so so good!\n  \n  Regular chicken soup is good as well. You can also make it with the bones and you can make it boneless.\n  \n  Beef tip soup is good as well. Especially when you just have a tasting like beef soup and then sometimes when you add different types of tomatoes.\n  \n  Oxtail soup is great! You have to really cook down the oxtail before putting it into the soup because oxtail is very tough you have to really marinate and tenderize the oxtail. But it's really good. It almost has the texture of tough tough beef. Like a ribeye kind've. Very tasty indeed. I say...  Don't knock it unless you've tried it.\n  \n  3 bean soup is cheap and good and is good for hard times when you don't have a lot of money.\n  \n  Red beans and rice! Can be watered down to a soup.

Some of the situations. It really makes you rethink everything. Really makes you appreciate what we have.\n  \n  And I also have helped the natural disaster thing also. I have myself went into houses and help people savage what they could. I have helped people with floods of almost 40 ft. It's scary.

Spray them in the cracks of your car and maybe even put a little bit in your cleaner or use a citrus smelling cleaner and clean your truck or house with it. Maybe get some sitrus smelling wax melts and have them going by your front door. After all they smell good anyway. At least your visitors will have a good aroma when they walk in the house.\n   \n\n     View more\n    \n\n","37861":"\n  I would start up a food bank and a side natural disaster team.

And if they needed us to supply them with food, water, clothing or some where to stay, we got them. But at the same time they have to make an effort to try to start over again. And we got them there too. Help them with getting new jobs places food and the things they need all over again. Help guide and re-establish. We also would try to provide classes for them to help them turn around. With all of this going on in their lives I'm sure that they would have some sort of depression. We would try to give them that boost again.\n  ","37862":"\n  On our paranormal explorations? Absolutely. Very often. We use, what are called EVP recorders. These are very small skinny recording devices that are very sensitive to hearing. Very good for hearing abnormal sounds. Sounds that the human ears can't hear. Sounds that are so quiet that only the record can hear. You have to be careful and try not to breathe too hard when you're using it. Because it can detect even the sounds of your breath. Or try not to make any type of sudden movements or walking. It can hear a pin drop for sure.

We have been through it and back with this long distance. We still fight it today but in different ways.\n  \n  We want so much more for us. Yet we can only do so much.\n  \n  Wedding dresses are so expensive also. I never went to my own prom because it was just so expensive. People were paying for senior and Junior Rings almost $1,000 a piece... and prom dresses that worth thousands of dollars and graduation dresses the same. I just did not have all that kind of money... It was not that important to me to look stylish and high grade. I knew how much the situations\/moments meant to me. I did not need to express them through expensive dress wear. Especially something and I'm probably only going to wear once or twice in my life and then it's going to hang in my closet for the rest of eternity or given to someone else.\n  \n  I do not judge other people for wanting to do this. If you have the money I would definitely do it! But I do not have the kind of money to pay for such expensive wear for such events. And that's okay. I am happy no matter what. Because I love him.

It's literally unpredicted on what a girl exactly want\/like unless you actually do it and find out yourself. Or you ask her what she likes but it's supposed to be a surprise. You don't want to be expected. You just need to have a lot of confidence in yourself. Just go with it. If she doesn't want kids and maybe she's not the kind of girl for you. There's also a way you can go about it too but it doesn't mean that she still might not think it's weird. But I honestly wouldn't think that's a bad gesture, just depends on how you feel about it of course. You guys are definitely Young. Definitely don't make it seem like you are proposing to her. Because then three weeks later you find out that you did the wrong thing and they turn out to be crazy and you get stuck lol. Just make it literally 100% a commitment ring. Like a promise ring in a way. You really need to be serious about it tho. Her. Like... if you are going to make that commitment say that you need to live up to it. She also needs to understand that you're not around playing games and that she needs to be on board like you are. She doesn't exactly have to have to make the same commitment but you would like her to try to be on board about it. But this is like I always tell everyone. You're young. Don't take it fast. Be one day at a time with her.

Never put someone down for their gut feeling. Because you never know the person that is being \"lame\" might be making a life saving decision. By the way the lame person is symbolizing the person being their selves and following their gut feeling. A person that might not be wanting to take that risk for a reason. A risk is a risk. But some people want to live longer. They might take more risks than others. Considering like I said a risk is a risk. Doesn't always mean you might make it. You only live once. But really... you only live once. 1 time. You go. You done. So Choose Wisely with the decisions you make. Don't pressure someone else into doing something because their gut feeling tells them not to.

My mama and husband.\n  ","38503":"\n  What in the world? L\n  \n  ? lol idk & idk if i wanna know.\n  ","38504":"\n  Both sound nice but I think that I would like Chef more And I wouldn't want to be a film-maker I would want to be an actress more\n  ","38505":"\n  Honestly they always say be careful what you wish for so I don't think I would make a wish\n  ","38506":"\n  Right\n  ","38507":"\n  Eh. Def not many and not the 100% best but lol ish\n  ","38508":"\n  Of course. Many of times.\n  ","38509":"\n  Yee ??\n  ","38510":"\n  I will tell you what my spirit animal is. And it took me a long time to figure out what my spirit animal was. I really wanted it to be a dolphin but for some reason something was telling me it wasn't a dolphin.\n  \n  My whole life growing up I was a tomboy like kinda like person and I was always made fun of for being like the guys so I was always treated like one of the guys which I was fine with that but I got made fun of a lot for it but as I grew up I haven't exactly grown out of that tomboy stage. I still have that tomboy like attitude and style but I definitely grew up. And that resembles to me the lifestyle of a swan. They aren't the most beautiful creatures when they first are born and growing up for most of their life but when they get to a certain part of their life stay blossom into a beautiful bird they get their wings and they learn to fly. My spirit animal I saw in my dreams when I do have my dreams and for some reason came up a lot. I never really was a fan of swans until the past couple years coming by. So that's why I feel like my life is mostly resembles a swan and my spirit animal is a swan.\n  ","38511":"\n  I just got the dead ends cut off and I got long layers in my hair so I could get the volume up in my hair more. My hair is really really long. Around 3 feet long. Long long. I didn't update the color because honestly the little peekaboo golden spots that I have in my hair are still really bright and good. ? Next time I go I will definitely update my color. But the brown in my hair is my natural color. My hair is naturally dark brown. But the little highlight spots in my hair are dye. It is mostly gold, then a little burgundy and some red. I like those highlights because in the sun they shine really really bright. ? But yeah. My hair.\n  ","38512":"\n  You're welcome. It is no problem at all. I enjoy sending you guys these questions and seeing y'alls answers.\n  ","38513":"\n  You've got this.\n  \n  Put your heart and soul into a job. Let people know that you're ready to work and that you will help them do whatever you can.\n  \n  Know your goes and stops. Like... Know when to take a break and settle down for a moment. But also work hard. That's your job. You're making money to support yourself and a family if you have one of course. I'm sure you do.\n  ","38514":"\n  I mean if you want the job take as long as you have to?\n  ","38515":"\n  They are both okay.\n  ","38516":"\n  Any age when you are ready honestly. But I definitely would not have children too young though. Like too too young like... 10 11 12 or 13 years old....\n  \n  But a lot of people mess up and have children so young but they are able to take care of them then why not? If that's what they want. But I would not encourage young young pregnancy. Maybe about around the age of 18? That would be the youngest.\n  \n  The only thing about having children really young you are going to have to learn how to make sacrifices and learn different types of responsibilities. You are going to be different than other people around you. You may miss out on things but you will also have good experiences yourself. Having children changes you in good ways most of the time.\n  \n  But honestly anytime that you are mature enough to take care of another person is when I think you could start having kids.\n  \n  I just choose to wait because I want it to just be me and my husband for a while and he feels the same. Plus I just want it to be me and him around when we are taking care of the kids. Not having multiple people living with us or anything. No roommates.\n  ","38517":"\n  ???\n  ","38518":"\n  New adventures throughout the next three years\n  ","38519":"\n  Depends on how I am feeling. Sometimes I like my coffee really strong and no sugar or milk or anything in them. Sometimes I like to add Jameson to it and then sometimes I like my coffee like sugar water. Real sweet and milky\n  ","38520":"\n  ? lol I literally made this question not even a week ago and it looks like you have copied and pasted LOL\n  \n  Good job.\n  ","38521":"\n  About 30 minutes ago nobody was home ?\n  ","38522":"\n  Pie and seafood and fruit\n  \n  ?\n  ","38523":"\n  Omgosh. Someone was saying something so serious and it just sounded so wrong I just started laughing and they were like what? And then I just answered their question and helped them but still look just couldn't bear to not laugh a little bit... ?\n  \n  It's like don't mind me... I'm just a fuk-up human being.. ? Needs some saving. Jk jk.\n  \n  Just mind in the gutter sometimes...\n  \n  I guess this is what I get for hanging out with guys most of my life? LOL\n  ","38524":"\n  Lol. You are silly.\n  \n  One really good childhood memory was playing outside and throwing water balloons at each other and drinking out of the water hose, when it wasn't a weird thing. Jumping on the trampoline and teaching each other how to wrestle and how to defend ourselves so if we ever got face-to-face with a bully or something we knew how to take care of ourselves or at least try. But these right here we're definitely really good memories. I remember racing each other on our bikes up and down the street that we lived on and it being the world every day to do that. I remember going out in the fields and making baseball fields and playing with all of my friends out there and sometimes going inside when it got too hot and plays video games with them. Even playing basketball sometimes.\n  \n  I remember finding white rocks and using them as chalk when we ran out of sidewalk chalk and we would write with the white rocks and draw stuff on the cement.\n  \n  So many good memories. Wrestling in the mud with my cousins and sisters and friends. Playing board games and swimming in the pool with my sisters. Playing role play games in the living room and some all the time. Also playing video games with them in the room too sometimes. Going spend the night at my grandparents house with them. All the birthday parties. Wonderful wonderful old school memories. \u2764\n  ","38525":"\n  I don't know how to cook liver and beans but I know some people that do that. I think Popeyes puts liver in their beans actually? Idk  if you've ever had Popeyes Red beans and rice. It's absolutely delicious. I definitely like liver but it's every now and then of course. In moderation.\n  \n  Definitely good luck to you with finding recipes on liver and you're welcome\n  ","38526":"\n  I mean of course if maybe the virus is out breaking in their area maybe get a few things? and just be careful make sure you wash your hands... take plenty of showers... and change your clothes maybe a bit more often then normal... don't get in people's faces... make sure you probably wear a mask definitely considering the viruses really deadly but I don't think of any to go to the store and buy all of their toilet paper? and sanitizer or soap and masks... maybe one or two masks? maybe some soap and sanitizer but save some for everyone else? Share? No? Lol? ? I don't really understand the toilet paper thing? Get the regular amount of toilet paper maybe? Or maybe an extra roll but don't buy all of it? Other humans needs all the paper too?!\n  \n  I don't know...\n  \n  Strange...\n  \n  Hopefully this sickness stuff will wear off... just like the other outbreaks when they are let out.\n  ","38527":"\n  I actually don't really know how to cook liver. I know some recipes from other people but I've never tried them. I know some people that put liver in their beans and make different types of dressings and then of course fried livers. I'm not a huge fan of liver but I don't mind it every now and then. But I don't really know too many recipes but I could try with cooking liver.\n  ","38528":"\n  Today is a very good day. The weather is great and though on the horizon it definitely looks like a storm is rolling in...\n  \n  But today has been going really good. Thanks for asking. I hope that your day is going all right?\n  ","38529":"\n  Definitely a 10. I've been through a lot of stuff where I had to be patient to get to the good outcome. Especially cuz I was in a long-distance relationship for about five years. We're together and happy. Married and stronger than ever. Now I'm always distant from family and friends and always have to be patient to see them. Patience is definitely a virtue. Things will work out if you are patient. My greatest family and friends are all from all over the world. Some more than definitely I am always distant from someone that I love. I am used to it. Patience plays a very big role in my life. I had to learn it.\n  ","38530":"\n  Liver is okay\n  ","38531":"\n  Thank you so much. ??\n  ","38532":"\n  I do.\n  ","38533":"\n  I am a photographer so not much\n  ","38534":"\n  I would want to have kids with my husband that's my answer\n  ","38535":"\n  Most definitely Linkin Park\n  ","38536":"\n  I wouldn't want to change anything because then it might change today\n  ","38537":"\n  Yeah?

Doing great. Thanks.\n  ","38544":"\n  I 100% agree with you. People are so focused on other people's business that they don't focus on themselves.\n  \n  A lot of the times people will get jealous of other people's successes. Why get upset at someone else's successes??\n  \n   Why not instead... they get out and succeed themselves instead of making fun of someone else's? And how they got there and how they like to do it. Because obviously they're doing just fine. They don't need you to tell them how and what to do. Constructive criticism is fine but rude and unnecessary and too much criticism as I said is unnecessary.\n   \n\n     View more\n    \n\n","38545":"\n  Followed ??\n  ","38546":"\n  I did see him.

But I don't like too much of it. A lot of times I'll put it in chicken salad. But not like a green salad chicken salad type thing. No. This salad is more or less like an ingredient dip type thing. Made with eggs and different types of seasonings cut-up chicken and mayo and mustard.  And a bunch of other things in it. Just depending. I also enjoy making certain sauces out of mayonnaise. I mix it with a few other to make this certain type of sauce. I like a little mayonnaise on sandwiches but very lightly. I also like a little mayonnaise on a hot dog.

It's okay to have a gut feeling and try to keep yourself safe but in the end try not to judge a book by its cover. Plus don't always judge someone by their past.

Maybe.\n  ","38617":"\n  I used to love playing with Tinker Toys and I have always wanted to own another set. My whole childhood I asked for a set of them over and over again but for some reason they were always so expensive. So I never really bothered with them. I didn't really want my parents to spend that much on them. And I mean they were really expensive. I guess because everybody was buying them. They weren't worth the money they were asking for. Honestly being the age I am now even I would still play with them if I got the opportunity. I love  Tinker toys. I like building. Building never gets old. Creating never gets old.\n  ","38618":"\n  Absolutely 100% true. What you do with your life is your choice and is what you do. It is no one else's fault if you get to failure. But everyone also makes mistakes.\n  ","38619":"\n  I do. I love lifting weights. I find it a challenge. It also makes me feel really good. I like staying toned. Burning some muscle.

Kinda do. ? obviously\n  ","38627":"\n  I honestly don't try to eat too much in a day.\n  \n   Breakfast is definitely important. I try my best to drink a lot of water. Sometimes I like to make infused water. Infused water is basically adding fruits or vegetables to your water. Naturally flavors your water in a healthier way. Or get me some juice, but I like to add a little bit of water because sometimes the juices are a little strong. So I kind of water down my juice a little bit. I always add ice. Ice cold juice is the best. Not drinking soda for a while..  you get used to drinking water and then when you go to drink juice, juice gets to be really strong tasting. So to calm down the strong taste I water it down or add a lot of ice. Usually I do both. It works out for me. Drinking juices is really good for you because it goes through your body really quick. Helps your metabolism ALOT.\n   \n   Sometimes I like to get me a little almond milk or regular milk it just depends on what I'm in the mood for? I usually drink 1% or skim milk. I like to eat some yogurt in the morning. Sometimes I splurge and I get me some fresh fruit in the morning. But honestly in the morning getting sugars is really important. Sometimes I'll make me some eggs. Just depends.\n   \n    I try to go on a morning walk and walk my dogs. If I don't do that I usually clean around the house and I end up walking myself to death. And then I end up going to work anyway and walking around all day there. Then I come home and still work out. I usually always do stretches right when I wake up in the morning.\n    \n     Then for dinner. I do love to cook. I love Seafood. I tried to eat small portions. And I make sure that I eat dinner very soon not right before bed or anything. Absolutely love stir fry and I really like vegetables.  For lunch I try to eat usually just eat a snack. Maybe get me some crackers? Sometimes I like to make a smoothie? Or maybe eat some celery? Maybe a granola bar with that. But yeah. Light eating in the morning. Snack lunch. Light dinner. So yeah. Lol.\n     \n\n       View more\n      \n\n"}}
