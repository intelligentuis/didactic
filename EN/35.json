bridge ? or is it worth being friends with them at all after ? because sometimes it s not . better to go your separate ways . or is it really that big of a deal of why you two broke up ? can you go back to being friends ? all of these are the questions that you ask yourself . and as i said before , sometimes it s really easy to go back to being just friends and sometimes it s impossible and you just need to not talk to each other and cut all ties . i have one friend that i grew up with and we dated off and on for years but we never really understood why it would never work out but the reason later on we figured it out is because we were better off being just friends . so we are still friends but we don t talk everyday . and that s fine . there s nothing wrong with that . it depends on what your intentions are with that friendship . and that s when trust comes in . got to trust somebody when it comes to making friends with both girls and guys . that s life . then control . all those old feelings aren t there anymore . just friends type of feeling is there and only . it is possible . it is not impossible . nothing is impossible . we are all independent people . we have the ability to do anything we set our minds too . we need to give ourselves more credit . confidence . it plays a big role in our lives . my husband me and him are actually good friends . we check in on that old

don t like that . taco flavor is very very strong . it has to be kind of send out in my opinion . if it s a super duper taco flavored then after three bites i m like i can t have no more . very rich in tasting . but i love a gumbo . of any kind . broccoli cheddar soup is delicious ! potato celery soup is good . shrimp and corn soup is probably one of my most favorite because you can put many different types of cream of soups in it to make it flavorful . i like to make this soup real thick chicken and dumpling soup is so so good ! regular chicken soup is good as well . you can also make it with the bones and you can make it boneless . beef tip soup is good as well . especially when you just have a tasting like beef soup and then sometimes when you add different types of tomatoes . oxtail soup is great ! you have to really cook down the oxtail before putting it into the soup because oxtail is very tough you have to really marinate and tenderize the oxtail . but it s really good . it almost has the texture of tough tough beef . like a ribeye kind ve . very tasty indeed . i say . . . don t knock it unless you ve tried it . bean soup is cheap and good and is good for hard times when you don t have a lot of money . red beans and rice ! can be watered down to a soup . very good ! and these are just a few . there are so many more .","32710":"thanks . ? i appreciate your kind words . it s actually really fun and it makes you feel really good . i have done both of these forms of volunteer work before . my whole life i volunteered at my maw maw and paw paw s food bank that they started years ago . it s a lot of fun seeing smiles on people s face but it s also really hard seeing them going through those things . especially when it randomly happen to them , it could happen to us . any of us . some of the situations . it really makes you rethink everything . really makes you appreciate what we have . and i also have helped the natural disaster thing also . i have myself went into houses and help people savage what they could . i have helped people with floods of almost ft . it s scary . i ve been through katrina , rita , gustav and many more other hurricanes . tornadoes . it s nuts . real .","32711":"littlefukers that s for sure what they are . lol ? i heard that ants don t like citrus smells or flavors so if you have an ant problem in your house or in your car and you don t want to resolve to using poison maybe try sprays that have citrus smells in them . spray them in the cracks of your car and maybe even put a little bit in your cleaner or use a citrus smelling cleaner and clean your truck or house with it . maybe get some sitrus smelling wax melts and have them going by your front door . after all they smell good anyway . at least your visitors will have a good aroma when they walk in the house . view more","32712":"i would start up a food bank and a side natural disaster team . a team that would go and help go in and people when tornadoes , hurricanes or floods happened or any type of natural disaster for that matter . and if they needed us to supply them with food , water , clothing or some where to stay , we got them . but at the same time they have to make an effort to try to start over again . and we got them there too . help them with getting new jobs places food and the things they need all over again . help guide and re establish . we also would try to provide classes for them to help them turn around . with all of this going on in their lives i m sure that they would have some sort of depression . we would try to give them that boost again .","32713":"on our paranormal explorations ? absolutely . very often . we use , what are called evp recorders . these are very small skinny recording devices that are very sensitive to hearing . very good for hearing abnormal sounds . sounds that the human ears can t hear . sounds that are so quiet that only the record can hear . you have to be careful and try not to breathe too hard when you re using it . because it can detect even the sounds of your breath . or try not to make any type of sudden movements or walking . it can hear a pin drop for sure . even if you were to wave your hand around the area could hear the air moving .","32714":"i ve seen many objects including books fly off the shelves during investigations and other people s investigations . it is quite an intriguing event to witness on paranormal explorations .","32715":"i absolutely love tulips . they smell and look beautiful . they have such a unique look to them .","32716":"ikr ? sounds great .","32717":"i honestly don t really like bananas unless they are in a smoothie or cooked in something or baked in something . i just don t like the texture of a banana by itself . i don t know

bbq pit now . during hurricane katrina that s what we did . we had to be careful with food and how much we ate . . . because just like now food wasn t really at the highest abundance in the stores . .

impossible yet we are living it . we are living breathing proof of it . we have been through it and back with this long distance . we still fight it today but in different ways . we want so much more for us . yet we can only do so much . wedding dresses are so expensive also . i never went to my own prom because it was just so expensive . people were paying for senior and junior rings almost , a piece . . . and prom dresses that worth thousands of dollars and graduation dresses the same . i just did not have all that kind of money . . . it was not that important to me to look stylish and high grade . i knew how much the situations moments meant to me . i did not need to express them through expensive dress wear . especially something and i m probably only going to wear once or twice in my life and then it s going to hang in my closet for the rest of eternity or given to someone else . i do not judge other people for wanting to do this . if you have the money i would definitely do it ! but i do not have the kind of money to pay for such expensive wear for such events . and that s okay . i am happy no matter what . because i love him . i m not here for all of that . and that beautiful blouse i still have in my closet and i love very much . every time i wear it or hold it it makes me cry because i love it so much . i remember that day . getting to tell him that i was going to be with him for the rest of my life . i never more made a better decision . no regrets . my life . no never . i am happy . yes . very . ?","32730":"i do drink alcohol but on occasion only mainly .

they want to get jealous and try to mess things up . why try to mess them up ? petty stupid jealousy . they don t even have to know you . people get jealous because they can t complete the same

always have a bar of soap , regular liquid soap and a thing of hand sanitizer by our sinks and our house . why so many different things ? because different people prefer different things when they are washing their hands . some people like bar soap and some people like liquid soap and then even after washing your hands i like to sanitize my hands . was never different , never changed . always the same . still is . in my house . i even have a thing of wipes nearby is somebody for first just a hand wipe or something instead of a hand sanitizer considering sometimes it drys your hands out . always had a ton of bottles next to my toilet to clean the toilet throughout the day . never understood why these people are buying all these lysol cans and clorox like they have never cleaned their bathroom before ? very confusing . . . and then lastly all these people buying all this bathroom tissue . t p . they aren t sharing . they don t need things toilet paper . now people that really are running out of bath tissue don t have anymore at all . and now they re buying all the paper towels . all this sickness stuff is just going to show how selfish people really are . we definitely should

want like unless you actually do it and find out yourself . or you ask her what she likes but it s supposed to be a surprise . you don t want to be expected . you just need to have a lot of confidence in yourself . just go with it . if she doesn t want kids and maybe she s not the kind of girl for you . there s also a way you can go about it too but it doesn t mean that she still might not think it s weird . but i honestly wouldn t think that s a bad gesture , just depends on how you feel about it of course . you guys are definitely young . definitely don t make it seem like you are proposing to her . because then three weeks later you find out that you did the wrong thing and they turn out to be crazy and you get stuck lol . just make it literally a commitment ring . like a promise ring in a way . you really need to be serious about it tho . her . like . . . if you are going to make that commitment say that you need to live up to it . she also needs to understand that you re not around playing games and that she needs to be on board like you are . she doesn t exactly have to have to make the same commitment but you would like her to try to be on board about it . but this is like i always tell everyone . you re young . don t take it fast . be one day at a time with her . because then one day if you do make it with her and y all are married and having kids y all are going to wish

t always mean you might make it . you only live once . but really . . . you only live once . time . you go . you done . so choose wisely with the decisions you make . don t pressure someone else into

chilling at home and try not spread bacteria around person to person especially . but people do not need to go in the stores and buy everything . they need to share these items . you only need one or two i saw cans of lysol in your house . i have seen people grab are more cans . that is selfish . then other people can t get a can if they need it . especially people that are dealing with sicknesses and their houses . or maybe people that just want to clean their house . or people that just use lysol cans on a daily basis . they can t get a can because you decide to take them all for just

even though fruit is good for you it still contains natural sugars so you re still eating sugar . it s good to eat it in moderation because it is good for you because it s natural and has natural juices and sugar but to only eat for an entire month would be a treat for sure but it would exactly not be the greatest for somebody . but yeah fruit is good . but yeah fruit is good and i try to eat
