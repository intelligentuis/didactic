   Did you think all that and a bag of chips?  Were men calling you chips and smiling? If so it’s a negative
  ","
  Nah, it came from two of my younger cousins. We were all in the car going to my aunts and their dad has nicknames for them and so they were calling each other them and then decided that I needed a nickname too. I assume one of them came up with chips bc there was an empty bag of chips near us in the car and so they voted that that was gonna be my nickname. After that, it just kinda stuck, but I use it more for online things -- no one really calls me it, but I like it. It kinda reminds of like a computer chip bc I really love technology, so it's kinda fitting. A nickname that people call me a lot is ""J"" tho

   Would it be an issue if your friend has weed to smoke but has to ask you to borrow money for gas. And this is not the first time.
  ","
  It depends on whether it felt like this 'friend' was taking advantage of me or not. If they just want my money and they haven't even been paying me back, then yeah, it's become an issue. If they have the qualities of a good friend and I can tell they are really in need and that asking me for help is hard for them but they have no other choice, then yeah, I'd lend em money.

   rant about anything
  ","
  Today in DBT group the leader was asking us in what kinds of situations do our emotions 'fit the facts' and we were starting with fear. No one was saying anything so I decided to say what came first to my mind and I basically said ""when we see a snake we might experience fear"" and she was all like smiled and said ""I feel like that's more disgust,"" and I get how she may not wanna write that specifically down bc not everyone is afraid of snakes and there's not always a reason to be afraid of them (though some can be dangerous). But she could have at least accepted my idea as like ""if we see something that we think might hurt us or that we have a phobia for, we may experience fear."" I mean, that does fit the facts bc the fact is, we are afraid of snakes and so when we see one, it makes sense that we might experience fear. The dismissiveness of my suggestion just made me feel like 'why do I even bother speaking up in group... it gives me anxiety anyway and it just feels like the leaders have smth against whatever I have to say a lot of the time like maybe I just need to stay in the background' and that annoyed me bc I'm trying to work on my anxiety and it's like the world wants to keep giving me reasons on why I should feel uncomfortable... I know this is kinda unreasonable bc not everything we say is gonna be accepted, but it gets really frustrating when it feels like the ratio is really uneven. I think for this particular situation I just felt really invalidated afterward. I'm sure the leader didn't mean to make me feel that way, but she could have approached everything differently than just humiliating me bc I'm scared of snakes. After that, I just kinda tuned out for the rest of group, pretending to listen but really just chilling bc I just felt really frustrated with myself and the group and just life.

  I've been more depressed lately than I have been in a bit, but otherwise, no. Things haven't been much different than they have for months.

   Is it because of the individuals that you surround yourself with? Because if you were one who likes to sacrifice a bit of themselves for the happiness of others, then why enjoy any of that if the recipient does not deserve it?  It’s like helping with someone’s homework without even being thanked

  Not necessarily, I mean I'm sure doing more for others than they would for me probably contributes to the depression, but it's the main factor. I don't surround myself with very many others ultimately though. I wish I did more but I don't many friends and no one close.

  ""So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
  
  I built a safe room and I don't let no one in there
  
  'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear
  
  And not come back, and I admit, I am emotionally scared
  
  To let anyone inside, so I just leave my doors locked
  
  You might get other doors to open up, but this door's not
  
  'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
  
  And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
  
  I'm barricaded inside, so stop watchin'
  
  I'm not coming to the door, so stop knockin', stop knockin'
  
  I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
  
  I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
  
  I know that shuttin' the world out ain't solvin' the problem
  
  But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
  
  I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
  
  But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's livin' in here
  
  Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
  
  Maybe that's the problem, 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
  
  I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious, he never did
  
  He must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in
  
  Now I'm in a position, it's either sit here and let 'em win
  
  Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
  
  'Cause in order to do that, I'd have to open the doors
  
  Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore""

  Well, I don't agree with commit to ""everything."" Everyone should have their own moral, limits and personal values. I get what you're saying that a woman shouldn't have to ask.

   Would you rather 5% of the population have telepathy, or 5% of the population have telekinesis? You are not part of the 5% that has telepathy or telekinesis.
  ","
  Well, it depends. Can the people who have telepathy just read anyone's mind or do can they only communicate in the minds of each other? Cus if the latter, I would rather telepathy. But with the telekinesis is there any limits? Cus if not, that would invite a lot of crime and the people wouldn't even be able to be contained in a jail or prison or smth if they did commit crime, so if there are certain limits, I would choose telekinesis, but otherwise, telepathy.

  - ""You ever heard the expression 'The best things in life are free '? Well, that expression is true.' Every once in a while, people step up they rise above themselves sometimes they surprise you and sometimes they fall short. Life is funny sometimes. It can push pretty hard but if you look close enough, you can find hope in the words of children, in the bars of the song, and in the eyes of someone you love. And if you're lucky, if you're the luckiest person on this entire planet, the person you love decides to love you back.""

   Men have it worse in America than women. I have a go fund me and I have raised zero $ because I am male. Laws need to be changed in America in favor of men. There are too many men in jail in America.

  What makes you so adamant it's bc you are a male? I know several men who have reached high goals on their gofundmes so it's kinda sounding like this might be more of a YOU problem.
  
  You know what's wack is that some men always wanna complain ""men have it worse"" but then when women try to stick up for them in various situations, they just try to enforce toxic masculinity. Like the actual unfairness men face is being told they have to mask their feelings or that they shouldn't cry in order to be real men or having superheroes always super fit and having abs and making it seem like all men have to be really strong and dehumanizing gay men [not stuff about gofundmes] ....all these stereotypes/pointless expectations that just shame certain men for how they are...but then I've seen so many men just try to bash other men and women for standing up to this stuff bc they wanna call it ""weak"" 🙄

What's your opinion?

  Uh idc where people wear masks. There are gonna get no judgement from me. Maybe there's reasons they wear them that I don't know about. Or maybe they like wearing the mask. Or maybe they tend to forget to put their mask on when they are out and about so they put it on before they leave the house and just keep it on. Whatever the reason is, I don't mind, it's not bothering me.

  There's a lot of things honestly. Too much to really type out here on Askfm.

  "

   Ok so the difference here would be I’m the show rhythm and flow, they have Rap Battles which requires a beat.. 


Battle Rap is A cappella a variety of style to lyrically or cleverly attack the opponent
  ","
  yeah that's what I'm saying, I don't keep up with rap battles much bc most don't have the beat and that's one of the best parts for me. otherwise, to me, it's more like spoken word (but targeted) and I'm not a spoken word enthusiast. it always annoys me when Conceited on Wild N' Out says his main tag ""cut the beat"" bc it loses the vibe for me. But I understand that most rap battles are acapella

   I'm at a crossroads in life I don't k ow which road to take. I'm 55 in 18 days there's nothing spectacular to show for my life. Except marriage work babies stay home mom for 20 years. I need a boost in confidence is anyone going through this or have gone through this. Suggestive advice is welcomed.
  ","
  Being married and having kids is a huge accomplishment! I wish I could call myself successful like that but all I've done is have to take less college classes at a time bc mental health problems put me in hospitals and lots of therapy... I'm 20. Lonely. I've only had one job, the major I want a degree in is super competitive, the work field is becoming super competitive and severe anxiety is preventing me from living my life how I wish I could. All of this +more has made my confidence almost none existent. So in my book, you are amazing. A lot of people only share their accomplishments so it makes others feel like everyone else's life is smooth and straight n' all, but in reality, a lot of people feel lost all the time. You will figure it out, it's normal. And remember that it's never too late to try smth new and it can inspire others

   A witch has cast a spell on you turning you into an inanimate, non-electronic object for a year. To be changed back into human form before the year is up, you need to be able to get at least a hundred people to touch you. What inanimate object would you be? 🤔

  A hundred different people? Then probably a door knob at some entrance to a chain restaurant downtown. Although, being an object my not be that bad....so maybe I'd choose something that isn't touched as often like the inside rack of an oven.

   Favorite lyrics atm?
  ","
  I shared some lyrics I really like a couple questions down, but to switch it up, heres a different lyrics I really like:
  
  Trying times all the time
  
  Destruction of minds, bodies, and human rights
  
  Stripped of bloodlines, whipped and confined
  
  This is the American pride
  
  It's justifying a genocide
  
  Romanticizing the theft and bloodshed
  
  That made America the land of the free
  
  To take a black life, land of the free
  
  To bring a gun to a peaceful fight for civil rights
  
  You are desensitized to pulling triggers on innocent lives
  
  Because that's how we got here in the first place
  
  These wounds sink deeper than the bullet
  
  Your entitled hands could ever reach
  
  Generations and generations of pain, fear, and anxiety
  
  Equality is walking without intuition
  
  Saying the protector and the killer is wearing the same uniform
  
  The revolution is not televised
  
  Media perception is forced down the throats of closed minds
  
  So it's lies in the headlines
  
  And generations of supremacy resulting in your ignorant, privileged eyes
  
  We breathe the same and we bleed the same
  
  But still, we don't see the same
  
  Be thankful we are God-fearing
  
  Because we do not seek revenge
  
  We seek justice, we are past fear
  
  We are fed up eating your shit
  
  Because you think your so-called ""black friend""
  
  Validates your wokeness and erases your racism
  
  That kind of uncomfortable conversation is too hard
  
  For your trust-fund pockets to swallow
  
  To swallow the strange fruit hanging from my family tree
  
  Because of your audacity
  
  To say all men are created equal in the eyes of God
  
  But disparage a man based on the color of his skin
  
  Do not say you do not see color
  
  When you see us, see us
  
  We can't breathe
  "

But 2020 has been hell so I guess it's good to get that out of the way, although the cross between 2020 and 2021 is just a regular day like any so it's not like things are magically gonna get better. 2021 is about to be the same unless people can stop meeting up and wear fcking masks. And stop taking drugs and flying helicopters too. I can't deal with another death from someone I know or heard of rn.

  ","
  It's kinda depressing, but it's very relatable so I like it:
  
  So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
  
  I built a safe room and I don't let no one in there
  
  'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear
  
  And not come back, and I admit, I am emotionally scared
  
  To let anyone inside,so I just leave my doors locked
  
  You might get other doors to open up, but this door's not
  
  'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
  
  And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
  
  I'm barricaded inside, so stop watchin'
  
  I'm not coming to the door, so stop knockin', stop knockin'
  
  I'm trapped here,God keeps saying I'm not locked in
  
  I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
  
  I know that shuttin' the world out ain't solvin' the problem
  
  But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
  
  I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
  
  But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's livin' in here
  
  Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
  
  Maybe that's the problem, 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
  
  I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious, he never did
  
  He must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in
  
  Now I'm in a position, it's either sit here and let 'em win
  
  Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
  
  'Cause in order to do that, I'd have to open the doors
  
  Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore

  I was in some intense therapy earlier this yr, but now I just meet with therapists, psychiatrists, etc. 4 times a week. I've been really worried about falling behind in life tho from everything depression has prevented me from doing and I can't shake the hopeless feeling or like I will never get better. I feel like I was going uphill but now I'm going back downhill 😢
  
  thanks for the advice, I will try it! 🙏🏾 I'm underweight and have never had a very big appetite so I'm working with a nutritionist to fix this eating disorder and find a comfort food that can help me gain. trying to eat while not hungry is one of the hardest things for me tho 😖

   Is there something that you carry on yourself that other people think is unnecessary but to you is necessary? I know this one girl she carries a bottle of bbq sauce b/c every time she goes out, nobody has bbq sauce at the restaurants... so she carries a bottle of barbecue sauce in her purse. XD LOL
  ","
  Haha, that's not unnecessary, that's smart! I used to have a lot of random handy stuff in my backpack, but I cleaned out my backpack about a month ago and took out some of the stuff I think. But currently, things always carry around in it are thinking putty, a foldable Bluetooth keyboard, sodoku books, like 3 different kinds of chargers even though I don't need em all, a sim card ejector tool, an SD card box, an empty plastic bag (you never know when one might come in handy), pads, whiteout, spare earrings, a clip, a coin dollar, a double headphone jack, extra earbuds, earbuds adapter for lightning and USB-C, panic attack meds, a tape measure, Cereve, chapstick, a mini notebook, a journal, a pen, and a flashlight.
  
  ....yeah, I guess one could say I have some unnecessary things in there, but I got an anxiety disorder so I guess that's what happens 😆😆My excuse is that you never know when these things might come in handy hahah

   🍬Let's talk about trick-or-treating. How is trick or treating in your 👻 neighborhood? When you were younger or how 🕷🕸it is now? Did you go house to house? Or did you have to go to town & go up & down 🌙 some of the blocks? Did you ever have cute little haunted houses? Tell me your experience. 🎃
  ","
  Idk how it is now, I haven't celebrated Halloween at all for yrs, but back in elementary school I lived in a residential area and so went house to house and most houses would have candy to pass out. I would typically just stick to our neighborhood. There was one haunted house in the area (that wasn't cute 😓👻) that I went to once with my brother and a friend, and then there was also this house who didn't have a haunted house set up but had a small front yard in front of their house and they would make it super spooky and my brother & I used to get scared. The dude I think was some kind of public speaking retiree and he owned a microphone so you could him hear doing his evil laugh and saying spooky stuff from blocks away. every Halloween He has this huge white beard that he would die all black too. He is also a friend of my dad's 😆

   Would you rather be exempted in an exam that you know you just cheated your way in, or be the presenter in a defense that only you did all the hard work but your teammates gets the credits same as you?
  ","
  Wait, so when you say ""exempted in an exam that I cheated in, doesn't that imply that I already did the exam? Bc, I cheated on the exam so I already took it...I'm kinda confused on that...
  
  But either way, I'm tempted to say the former bc I would do almost anything to avoid public speaking, and ""presenter"" sounds like public speaking. Plus, I don't really have an issue with cheating on exams... I can't really do it bc of morals I guess, but at the same time, I don't really have animosity for people who do bc I think exams are stupid. If the exams were really just for what they are said to be, which is so that the teachers can see where the students are at, then I would be against it all around, but that's not really what exams seem to really be. Exams in my experience typically give students a numeric score that tells the teacher whether they should pass or fail in their class - simply bc of this number. Rarely are we allowed to retake exams, although as humans, we don't all learn things linearly. Sometimes, we start fully realizing how to do something after the exam and then we have the knowledge but that's not reflected in our grade bc we failed the earlier test. So evidently then, the class is not grading us on what we know, it's grading us on our ability to learn complete concepts in small amounts of time, have significant memorization skills, be obedient and get things right on ""first times the charm."" It's not very fair bc it's not giving an accurate representation of what students have gained in knowledge throughout a class, yet that's the determinate for whether they pass or not. Then teachers have the audacity to say ""don't cheat bc the only person you will really be cheating with is yourself."" That's not true bc if you cheat and that gives you the right answer, then you have a passing grade and that's what your future is determinate on. So, that went into a very long vent, but basically, my answer is #1. Although, for the record, I don't cheat on tests....

  hm, well, there's a lot to mull over with this question:
  
  * If I had to, well then, I would have to, right? So, it wouldn't matter if I would or not.
  
  * I think bestiality is illegal in my state so, I believe I would not date one.
  
  * Although, if this beast was more human-like than animal-like and we lived in a city like the [French?] city that Belle did that had magic n' stuff, I may date the beast if I truly felt in love with them.
  
  * Though, since a real beast would not be human-like, I can't imagine any attraction I would have to one. Like I doubt we would even have any way of communicating to or understanding each other.
  
  * And idk that it would be safe to date someone with fangs and claws even if I liked them. Like what if they went all 'Bruce the shark from Finding Nemo' mode for a hot sec and remembered how much they love eating meat....like human meat....like me....

  Going to college only helps for getting recruiters' attention. Otherwise, you're likely not gonna enter the field having skills down any better than someone who didn't to college. Most people in the field are masters in certain aspects while college instead teaches students a little bit of knowledge in a ton of different aspects -- most of which you aren't gonna remember or ever use again after the course.

   People needs to learn to be patient and not assume you’re ignoring him/her. Like send message and be patient and wait for a reply
  ","
  Well, idk your situation, it may be entirely different. But, in general, I don't think it's patience really, I think it's anxiety. I can't speak for everyone, but I know many people feel they lack true connection and friends so when they find someone they think is potential to fill that hole in their life, they wanna chat, bond, etc. When they aren't getting responses, it makes em nervous that you don't like em or they are annoying you or that you don't care as much about the friendship as they do and that creates hard feelings. So, they message more for any kind of validation that they are still your friend and that they did nothing to upset you, you were just busy.

   Favorite high school memory?
  ","
  I hated high school (and all school) ngl, but this one time the band teacher took a few of her students in pep band...I think there was like 5 of us + her, and we rode in her van, went out to dinner and then to this high school like an hr or 2 away to observe their pep band on their homecoming football game and we played along with them a bit and they were all super nice and I saw someone I recognized there that I had met the summer before so that was cool and then afterward we went to a coup (it was like 11pm or midnight or sum) and talked and laughed and then the teacher drove us each back to our houses (and I rode in the back) and it was just a super fun evening even tho I had bad period cramps 🤣 and we had also broke school rules bc this was a ""field trip"" non approved by the school, it was after school hrs, and two of us rode in the back 🤣🤣 but ofc we're never gonna sell the teacher out, plus it took a lot of begging for her to let us sit in back (there's no seat belts), but there weren't enough seats. She really put her job on the line for us hahaha but all went well

   do you believe in destiny? ❣
  ","
  I answered this a few questions ago, so I'll just copy my answer (bc nothing's changed for me in the last 2 mins) 👇🏾:
  
  idk. I thought about this real hard about a month ago or smth, and I just couldn't settle on whether I believe it or not. They say we choose our own destiny, but I don't think we always get to.... Like, George Floyd didn't choose to be murdered. I believe that we all can have dreams that we work towards. But I don't believe that just bc we put a lot of work towards them, we will achieve them. But I guess, destinies don't have to be reached, right? It's just what we feel our place in this world is. But, does everyone believe they have a place in this world? No. Many don't. they don't know their destiny and it depresses them and that becomes sort of a self-fullfiling prophecy after that. it's not their fault tho. some people can't live how they wish they could. some people are statistics of injustice as soon as they are born. some people aren't exposed to things that give them self-actualization when they are younger and so are lost when by the time they are an adult. Some people's lives have shaped them to be constantly anxious, uncomfortable, pessimistic, low-esteemed, feel inferior, sad, full of self-doubt or self-hatred...so their destiny is rigged.
  
  So, sure, I guess I believe in destiny, but only for some. It's part of what makes life so unfair and depressing; some people seem to only be allowed to have fate.
  
  As for me? Idk my destiny. Idk my worth or purpose or importance. I question my life everyday. I'm filled with pessimism and doubt, not bc I want to be, but bc I got ""sick"" with it. mental illness. or maybe I'm just where I reasonably should be and everyone else is just too happy.

He self-taught himself to dance by feeling the vibrations of the bass in the music and then dancing to that. So that's how my favorite dancer typically dances (he does popping) and it's super cool. He was who inspired me to teach myself to dance.

   If you could move super fast like The Flash or Quicksilver in a way so you could basically stop time for everyone but yourself whenever you wanted, in what situations would you choose to do it and why? 🏃‍♂️🕜
  ","
  when I lose things or forget things or to stop bad things from happening, taking timed tests, reading books, catching buses/trains/ferries/planes, traveling....
  
  but I'm a bit confused tho tbh. When they run, all it feels like to them is that everyone around them is frozen, right? But nothing else changes for them? Bc if I were to run the distances they did, would it still feel like I was just running normally, or would I actually barely even realize it bc I'm going so fast that I can hardly see/tell?
  
  I guess for example, if I were to run home from work one day bc I forgot my work vest, would I be running like how I normally run but just not losing as much breath or tiredness, feeling the same as I normally would but everyone would be ""frozen"" around me so by the time I got back time hardly passed, or would I feel faster and feel like I'm running in the time that everyone sees me as (a blur/streak) and just somehow be able to take things in faster (like stuff I read and my whereabouts, etc....)?
  
  Bc if it's the former, I think I would use it a lot less just bc shit would take a long time for me, even if it was only really like 2 seconds in real time and it was fast for everyone else... But if it's the latter, then my answer stays the same.
  
  This is smth I've never understood bc when The Flash does important shit really fast, then the show slows down everyone else so we see Barry moving around and thinking in our time as if things aren't going on really fast for him, it just seems that way for everyone else... but then they show clips of him doing small things like reading a book or running to work and they just show it as a ""streak"" as if it takes no time at all (as it does). So I'm sitting here like 'did he really just stand there and read that whole book for what's like hrs for him but seconds for everyone else?...or did his mind really just intake the whole book super fast that it felt like nothing for even him too?

  living, this cruel world, abandonment, rudeness, discrimination, hate towards groups of people, gender roles, the society I live in, racism, deaths, losses, being separated from my family all my life, that I'm never good enough, poverty rates, exploitation, bad luck/my luck, ignorance, feeling invisible, myself being a failure, Naya Rivera...., me being a loser, school/education system.....so many things, but I'll stop there

   I’ll see people who support BLM, and be racist towards Asians, Latinos, etc. it doesn’t add up to support the movement and be racist towards Asians or Latinos and everyone else, it can’t go both ways and it’s confusing. I support BLM, but I’m not racist towards others.
  ","
  Yep. It's def not right. Unfortunately, the world we live in sucks. Not enough people know how to accept and show kindness and love towards each other.
  "
943373,"
   Why?
  ","
  Asking ""excuse me"" in that context is like asking ""I'm sorry, what?""
  "
943374,"
   How is it that some people can support the BLM movement and still be racist to others (ex: Asians/Latinos etc.)?
  ","
  Idk, bc I don't know those people.  I do know that racism, by definition, can only exist when one group has power and influence over another. Therefore, the ones racist to Asians/Latinos are white people. many white people I imagine (ofc not all) are finding it easier to just ""ride the wave"" instead of actually showing care for the situations. they may post smth when smth becomes big on the news (for ex, George Floyd), but they don't care if it's not on the news and they just post bc everyone else is doing it. After the news dies down (which sadly, it always does way too soon), they no longer care. There is not quite as much Asian or Latino police brutality in US (which is the only country I can speak for) so they don't make it on the news like that. therefore, some messed up white people may find it more ""safe"" or ""appropriate"" to be racist towards Asians and/or Latinos. they figure they won't get into as much trouble bc they aren't contributing to an as prevalent controversial issue in US. Anyway, that's just a spit ball theory. I don't really know and will never understand.
  
  And also, this can apply to discriminative Black or indigenous people as well. They just can't be ""racist."" But they can be discriminative or mean. Everyone can be that by definition. I do believe on an overall scale, POCs tend to unite more than divide. I had a deep and bonding race conversation with a Chinese friend today and I'm Black. We both understand each other. It's unfortunate not everyone can bond like that and have that validating and empathic connection.

This history of it is not smth to celebrate. I guess a lot of people only celebrate it as a way to be thankful for family and get together and feast now, so maybe it's alright....I'm still determining how i feel. I used to really love Christmas bc it was exciting, but now, I don't really think much of the holiday and my fam doesn't really do much. I also am not religious, so it doesn't have the same meanings to me. And my fam doesn't celebrate anything else, so.... I don't really have a favorite. I guess I appreciate MLK day and Juneteenth. guess my least favorite holiday is probably Valentine's day.

   If your best friend doesnot like one of your friend  as she had explosive fight with her and she asks you to stop talking with that friend  .will you quit talking with that friend  or you will keep on talking
  ","
  I would keep talking to them if they are still my friend and I like them and have nothing against them. No friend of mine gets to decide who MY friends are and if they think they do, then maybe they aren't really a friend of mine. But, I think in most situations that I can imagine, if a best friend of mine had an explosive fight with another person, there would be a reason I didn't enjoy that person anymore either and so both of us would cut ties with the person
  
  And also, it's not always about how that person mistreated me, if I feel they really mistreated my friend, then I will cut ties bc no one messes with my friends then gets excused by me. But if both are in the fault or I believe my best friend is the one who made a mistake this time, then I would not leave another friend for no reason except someone else asking/telling me to.
  
  In summary, I am not gonna let someone else decide who my friends are, I'm gonna stick with people who I appreciate who make me feel happy, aren't mean or rude, and who support me back. If the person is no longer that kind of person, then I will cut ties with them. And while I believe that would more likely be the case if a best friend of mine got into a fight with them (bc I would think my best friend and I have more similar beliefs and opinions -- that's park of what would make us best friends), it's not always like that ik, so I would do what I can to support both friends.

  idk, I don't really consider my mean friends, friends. there was this one guy, but we aren't friends anymore. he was just mean, problematic, self-entitled... and then this girl too, same thing, we aren't friends. she just always blew me off.
  
  I don't like the friends who ghost me tho. like not responding immediately -- I get that. I also understand not replying when once the conversation is over. but just not responding at all when we're in the middle of a conversation. it makes me feel like they don't care for talking with me and that I'm just a distraction for them when they're bored or have no one else at the time.... two friends in particular I'm thinking about here 🤔 I don't wanna say they are mean...., they just hurt me

   What is the worst movie you have ever seen? What made it the worst?
  ","
  Idk. I can name some movies I didn't like tho.
  
  - I didn't like the one featuring Marsai Martin that was about the mean boss lady shrinking bc it was supposed to be funny and it was not funny at all, it was just dumb. And I didn't like
  
  - Us (by Jordan Peele) - It made no sense to me...it was just way too abstract, and a lot of things never came together. He focused too much on trying to send a message thru the movie that the plot didn't actually make much sense. I was expecting much more from him after seeing Get Out.
  
  - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - It was written poorly. The director was trying to compete with the previous director so tried to make the movie nothing like the one before, and complained that the book was too long. Then he made stupid choices like lengthening the 1st tournament with the dragons which was horrible, revealing that Madeye wasn't Madeye right off the bat, making the France school all girls and the Hungarian one all boys, cutting out the Quidditch championship match, making Fleur (the only triward witch) a wimp in the maze, and letting like every single male in the cast have their hair long throughout the movie.
  
  - Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince - It just strayed from the original story so much, which wouldn't have been bad, if they hadn't just made it worse.
  
  - Captain America (the first one) - Had no character development. Cap was just the same person throughout the whole movie, just bigger after about half of the movie. He didn't even need to practice or learn how to use his super strength, he just popped out of the experiment knowing how to throw the shield and protect everyone already.
  
  - Iron Man 3 - What the hell was even going on....?
  
  - Inception - It was just sooo boring
  
  - Interstellar & Gravity - I hate movies that take place mainly all in space

I really enjoyed the first half of Batwoman tho and it was my favorite show for a bit until [spoiler alert] Julia started flirting with Sophie and they got together and it was just so messed up on every level (you would have to watch to know why), and then I was hurting so bad for Kate for numerous EPs to the point where the show just got depressing. And now Ruby Rose left and Caroline is refusing to recast apparently, but instead wants to create a whole different character which messes up the show completely.... It's all just disappointing, so my fav show got ruined within a short period of time.... I have also recently been liking watching Survivor's Remorse. It's very funny.

If it didn't include any supernatural abilities, it would probably be some kind of movie that includes a lot of dance, but idk what.
