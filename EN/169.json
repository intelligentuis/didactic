called aseptic necrosis of the femoral head , may increase your chances of going bald , and can possibly cause crazy mood swings also dubbed roid rage . all in all , avoid steroids or juicing or whatever people call it . you might look buff but who the hell cares if you re destroying your body to do it . so dumb .","156359":"hmmm probably some sort of cetacean or like maybe a sea turtle ? so

using a female zebra and a male horse and most often inherit the flighty , aggressive , temperaments of their zebra mothers along with her small stature and striped coat pattern , so i d say they re more similar to zebras . zorses are most often considered to be extremely difficult to train when started young and almost impossible to train when they re older because of their completely opposite personality to most domestic horses . just like mules , zorses are also born sterile and are unable to reproduce due to the mismatch in number , shape , and size of chromosomes present in their bodies resulting from having two different species as parents . as far as surviving in the wild , i m not sure . since there are no wild zorses to study , horses and wild zebras don t share the same natural habitat , and matings between the two species do not occur naturally , i m most inclined to say a zorse wouldn t fare well on its own in the wild and would most likely fall victim to predation pretty quickly .","156363":"anything healthy . she s obsessed with trying to take normal , good , food , and making it weird and . . . well let s just say good adjacent lol","156364":"he was a bit before my

afraid of or made uncomfortable by change , people with differing world views , new ideas , scientific progress , progressive social movements like pride and blm , or do you use any part of your belief system or religion to put others down for living differently than you ? if any or all of those things apply to you , you re closed minded . please re evaluate the way you conduct yourself and assess the negative effects your behavior has on the ones you love and others in your community . if not , congrats ! you re not a jerk and you know how to express empathy , are open to new ideas ,

good boys and they re actually pretty good friends . but if they did fight i think it would be pretty evenly matched . max is pretty feisty and boisterous and kind of a bully even though he s much smaller than chance so he d probably have a fighting shot at winning if he could get in a few critical hits since he s so quick and fiery unlike chance . chance is much bigger , heavier , and stronger than max though so i think if chance ever actually got a kick or stomp in he could make it a tko in one hit if he tried hard enough . he isn t very kicky or spooky or bitey tho tbh , so i ve never actually seen him try to defend himself . whenever max kicks at him or anything he kinda just looks unbothered and just stares at him lol . i think chancellor would win with one good kick if he felt like it , but most likely he d win by just standing there and letting maximilian tire himself out lmao","156406":"at certain points in our lives everyone feels that way . don t listen to that voice in your head !","156407":"no the price has become inflated over in the past decade . you have to pay and it s extremely expensive . people have to take out loans for it most of the time and spend a good

didn t know what bullying was back then and wasn t doing it on purpose to make her feel bad","156419":"i don t even want to think about that . . . i m not interested in answering these kinds of

think talent or skill is the issue . personally , i know i could do my best to try to get the zebra used to tacking up and having a rider on its back . . . but it would never be a safe , ridable , happy , and dependable animal that wanted to build a friendship and relationship with you like a domestic horse would . it s in their psychology and body structure . zebras aren t wired the same as domesticated horses since they haven t had thousands of years of artificial breeding to select out their naturally fearful nature and small builds . it would honestly just be cruel to try and force them into a situation that would make them uncomfortable like that imo i mean , could any asshole just scare and force the animal into being subservient for a while just to sit on it just to say you rode it ? yeah i guess . but what i m saying here is thats totally messed up and i don t want any part of it .","156425":"i don t like to be in the gossip mill so no . i only have like friends anyways

all about and yeah . haha i decided i m not a fan of it at all","156431":"no . there s a reason humans have not been able to domesticate and therefore ride or use zebras as pack animals . firstly , they are extremely flighty , unpredictable , and have been known to have a vicious kick . they evolved to fend off attackers like lions ! secondly , zebras are much too small to be a viable riding horse . they aren t mentally or physically equipped as a species for riding","156432":"no not really . like , some people try to scream at me and argue on their asks but i usually couldn t care less what they re saying and it s something silly anyways . in my experience , people who try to pick fights anonymously over the internet are def not worth my time and none of them want to hear my answers to their questions or arguments anyways , they just want to have something to be upset about and have someone to validate their tiny , fragile , worldview","156433":"i have a few gripes about the industry as a whole that just really bother me and turn me off from horse racing . even if not every single racehorse trainer is outright abusive to their animals , the extreme physical toll that running so fast takes on the horses bodies results in poor health and injury that can even result in the death of the horse . horses were never meant to run that fast or for so long . it s people who have bred them to be that way and it s people who are stressing horse s bodies to their breaking points . the idea in general seems almost cruel to me . i also have a distaste for the general poor treatment of the vast majority of animals running races who aren t top winners , for how many horses a year die at racetracks as a result of being pushed too hard or from being mishandled , and the fact that horses are raced while they re very young years old before their bones are developed and fused enough to carry a rider or properly absorb the shocks of galloping at top speed over long distance . i hate the way that so many horses essentially get discarded when they don t win like pieces of garbage left to rot out in a back field somewhere or sent to slaughter to make dog food . the culture of horse racing which treats the animals like pawns in a game designed to make money with no regard for the welfare of the animals also really bothers me and makes me feel uncomfortable . not to mention the shortcuts , cruelties , and seedy medical practices like pin firing that are also happening behind the scenes just so people can feel like they re getting ahead or to force the horse to ignore pain in order to make them more money . not sure if it s the case anymore , but i know jockeys historically haven t been treated particularly well either and have starved themselves and lived on low wages to make weight and get by .","156434":"sure , there are lots of things and shows and movies that i like . i m not an active part of any fandom though , i m more of a lurker . i don t participate in any discussion boards or reviews or have merch or anything of any shows","156435":"quickness has never really mattered that much to me for horses that i work with haha . i don t like or support horse racing but i guess those are still probably the fastest horses i ve ever seen","156436":"in general i like whatever sandman does lol","156437":"that sucks my dude .","156438":"i don t

bound up , or get it wrapped around their necks or stuck in their throats and die from asphyxiation . here is a research poster presentation i authored on the subject for the longwood university

jobs and it isn t about control . you give cues that the horse willingly follows . for the rider it s about balancing on the horse and holding your own self up with no tension or force . it s about knowing when is a suitable time to give a cue , where you both are in space , and how to ask your horse to follow your directions . for the horse it s holding himself up and in balence , supporting your weight , listening for you , and thinking about where his body is in space .","156794":"haha uh cause it s fun and it s my passion and i just like working with the horses","156795":"not sure what

be completely balanced in the saddle before you learn to jump your horse lol . please don t try jumping unless you already know the basics . otherwise you will hurt your horse on accident or yourself . assuming you have the basics this unfinished infographic i didn t add the words to yet shows the correct jumping position with balanced horse and rider in the top left , and then incorrect rider positions with unbalanced horse and rider . if you re unbalanced then your horse will not be able to jump well and will be unbalanced and risks injury to you both","156814":"if this is some sort of innuendo i don t get it and it s not funny","156815":"i can give you advice on how to start to learn equestrian but it would be hard for me to actually teach you personally lol","156816":"are you

more say . i say that bc so far i ve been the list maker , planner , researcher , reservation booker , packer , organizer , and navigator in all our adventures lol . sandy s just the idea man who comes along","156843":"yeah sort of but mostly no not at all lol being accepted by your fellow people is an important part of a healthy and happy human psyche ! so to a very small extent , yeah it kinda sorta matters what others that are close to you think of you in that you need to get along well with others around you and have them form positive opinions of you in order not to be lonely and have friends . but it doesn t really matter what other people outside of your group think of you like social media followers , strangers , etc . the human brain was built to seek acceptance and positive interaction so we could help each other , share , and survive . . . but we weren t built to be equipped to deal with so so many thoughts and opinions of us at once . that explains why rando s negative or hateful internet comments are so detrimental to some people s mental health even though they ll probably never even meet that hater and they know their rude comment is

memory","156882":"actually it s not that great . that s a bit of misinformation based on outdated nutritional science that corporate america capitalized on and ingrained into the collective

people think","156923":"cotton candy frappuccino it s a vanilla bean frap with raspberry syrup . it s super good","156924":"haha no","156925":"ok so like , this is gonna be a long answer but i wanna explain my reasoning if that s okay ! to answer your question no it s not bad it s good to be supportive of your fellow people no matter their preferences for a partner ! supporting and loving thy neighbor no matter his her appearance , gender , sexual preference , or race is the most christian thing you could do ! god preaches love , not hate ! i think some people get confused when interpreting that specific part of the bible and that there s still a lot of negative stigma surrounding lgbtq put there by the church that s leftover from the middle ages when they were very focused on creating child producing marriages and on population growth since everyone died so young back then since they didn t have good medicine . basically , i ve come to understand that they saw that homosexual relationships didn t produce children , so therefor they re were seen as bad and pointless by lots of people back then . . . plus the church used its power and influence to control the dumb uneducated masses of people by taxing , tithing , and offering indulgences to sinners and used fear of going to hell as punishment for not doing what they said because then you d be going against gods word aka undermining their influence basically they scared people into conforming to what benefitted them for a long time in history . things like being gay were bad back then because it didn t benefit them monetarily or society for population stabilization . now we have food medicine and lots of people so that ideology is totally pointless now . still though , all that historical talk just furthered the negative stigma around being homosexual and it became ingrained into the collective human memory . imo , with all these social movements and stuff about gay rights , we re now realizing that it was men who corrupted the word of god for their own benefit back then , and what i think god wanted the whole time was acceptance and love of all thy neighbors . the echoes of that time where people shunned and demonized lgbtq people can still be heard today pretty loudly , especially in small towns and places that are more focused on traditional , conservative , values that are passed down from generation to generation . information is just slower to disseminate in small places like that because most flow of info is centered around big cities with lots of influx of new people and ideas . honestly there s a lot lot lot to unpack from different biblical interpretations , different historical precedents and times that shaped our own time now , historical events and social norms that influenced the church s teachings , and the echoes of those old ways that are still influential in how we tbink today . . . like honestly way too much for an ask post it really boils down to one thing for me though and it s if all people are children of god and god loves and accepts all his children , then it seems to me he would want you to do the same thing as well .","156926":"people who fabricate their own truth based on feelings because they cannot accept or do not want to accept peer reviewed , repeatable , scientific research and fact based on data and mathematical

thanks lol","156930":"you could say hey babe , i ll cover your vet , feed , and farrier bills this year haha nah jk jk but actually though , taking a genuine and actual interest and having curiosity in what she does with them would go a long way and make her feel supported and impressed that you cared about something she likes doing ! ask questions and try to learn stuff about it so you two can talk about it ! if you wanted to take a it a step further and really wow her you could try learning to be gentle enough to ride a horse right next to her on the trail and go on a romantic trail ride ! it sweeps me off my feet when my bf does that with me . now it s something we do every so often together and he s learning to control the horse better with less effort . it s super neat and it worked with me lol so i bet it ll work with your gf","156931":"i love riding trails ! it s always a blast . going to waterfalls seems so relaxing , that s crazy cool you get to do that casually . there are some forest trails near me and ones that go through the neighbor s cow pasture on top of the hill that i like going to sometimes . i like the fields cause when he cuts down the grass during hay season you can gallop for a good long stretch over the flat ground where he drives the tractor . it s one of my favorite feelings , just running free up on the hill and being so close to the sky","156932":"aw that s so awesome i m so jealous ! ! what kind of things do you two do together , like what riding discipline do you do ?","156933":"i honestly have no idea lol . it s just what the

inclination was right . the pic below is a screenshot from an article called cattle steroid misuse appears common . after scientific study , it was concluded that there are indeed negative side effects of its use in humans . read the caption pic below for a few of those . i also found out that steroids for use in horses , cattle , dogs , and cats , known as prednisolone acetate , can cause premature birth or birth defects when taken by pregnant animals , so the same could be assumed for pregnant human athletes if they consumed it .","156939":"sadly , none of them really belong to me but

agnostic ways of thinking","156953":"i like carving it since that s what my family and i used to do every halloween and it s become a tradition painting them is fun though too ! i love to paint and trying to do it on a round surface like a pumpkin is a challenge","156954":"both are good !","156955":"i have social anxiety so i end up ghosting friends on accident a lot but i try not to do it on purpose bc i know it doesn t feel very good to get ghosted and i don t wanna make anyone feel like that if i can help it . it s gotten to the point where i definitely have had to cut certain people out of my life but it s been gradual every time . i make it a natural and slow ish process so neither of our feelings get hurt","156956":"that would be super super weird . it s never happened to me

favorite of the because max is afraid of everything and tends to be super jumpy and unsure of himself whereas chance couldn t care less about anything and is super chill . plus max is really sway backed from old age , little exercise over his lifetime , and poorly fitting tack all his life too which makes him a little less comfy to sit on chance is a fatty so he s super soft to sit on it s not really max s fault for being such a spook tho . i know it s cause his previous owners neglected him , left him alone in a pasture with no socialization , and they beat him a lot and forced him to do stuff he didn t understand and now he expects to be hit and yelled at all the time . it s just gonna take a long , long , time of building trust and friendship with him for him to calm down and stop being so afraid of new stuff and places . until then we ll just have to let him deal with it by bucking and rearing and jumping around like a crazy pony until he can calm tf down and realize everything is cool lmao","157130":"if it s about dating or personal hygiene then no . if it s about equestrian sports then sure .","157131":"that s very flattering of you","157132":"at least a few
