It should not be a big deal for women to walk around like that, the reasons you just gave is called immaturity. It's called they are still boys. Women should be allowed to walk around naked if they wanted too and men should have the respect to keep their head down and mind their own business. Look at how France treats their women, their topless and naked all the time for no reason - they do that because they know that the men aren't gonna act like uncultured children and they can be comfortable. That's the type of men I put myself around, ones who look into my eyes when they talk even if I'm standing in my underwear and if you don't know someone like that or never been around that - you should probably find new friends\n  ","672770":"\n  Real men don't have to tell people that they are real men?\n  "}}
