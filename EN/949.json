respect someone who used to be on this app . i thought she was afflicted with some so i bit my tongue . but i finna get off this app too soon","878158":"but really tho . . . meet with anthony i have a good feeling about it and believe you guys will be very happy together .","878159":"it s seem like that because i have a feeling someone in the situation isn t being direct . instead of texting , calling or unblocking the person that they care so much for . . . they rather be on an app . somethings can be resolve privately . not everything needs to be resolve public .","878160":"not true . first you guys must establish rules together and communicate as young mature adults . letting each other know where their at directly not indirectly . then if he disrespects or treats you like shit . walk away .","878161":"what other girls does anthony have ? is it facts or insecures ? every action has a reaction .","878162":"the more chances you give him the less respect he ll start to have for u . he will begin to ignore the standards that you ve set cuz he knows another chance will be given . he s not afraid to lose u cuz he knows no matter what you won t walk away . he s comfortable with depending on ur forgiveness .","878163":"follow your intuition and don t listen to negative people . they always have a solution","878164":"yes anthony isn t afraid of losing you because he knows you will always be there no matter what","878165":"yeah so you re just his back up plan . he s just playing games with you trust me .","878166":"since he doesn t follow you on instagram and hasn t been texting you i think he s dating another girl and might have had something sour happen and he wanted to reconnect with you so he could have you as a back up plan in case that relationship doesn t work in the end .","878167":"who s anthony","878168":"nate is cheating !","878169":"is this about anthony","878170":"can i tell you what i think about anthony ?","878171":"a friend of mine on ask is doing

playing games lol","878192":"doubt it , meet up with him or call him . i promise you all that doubt and him leaving you will be over for good .","878193":"i think a visit or phone call would def make him smile and very happy . i m sure you guys would be in a better place if that happens .","878194":"how d you tried to make him happy ? . see i ve been trying to get this girl to engage in a different settling to open up to her but she ain t with it and i ain t with it on this app . we both are being stubborn and childish . all of this could of been avoided with a simple call .","878195":"how have you been there for him ?","878196":"you got to get off that negative vibez . if you love him your ll be there for him . relationship is a way street . luley blocked me everywhere

request on there ?","878205":"i doubt anthony ashamed of you . probably a misunderstanding between you two . you guys should meet up or call each other and talk about ya issues . you would be surprise how much closure your ll get out of it .","878206":"ok who s anthony ?","878207":"last time i check it was chester now anthony who are these guys ? i know the real chester was a singer

t","878392":"chester bennington was the first celebrity death that crushed me . i couldn t believe it . i was in shock and thought it was fake . i was sleeping and then i woke up with a notification saying he committed suicide and i just froze and said no this isn t real and literally started panicking . my childhood , my hero , my inspiration , my smile , my everything has ended he s life i couldn t believe it . it s like he has impacted me so much during my life and i grew up listening to linkin park so you can only imagine how much it killed me when i heard that it was real . a piece of me died along with him . that piece of me will never be the same ever again . my hero and my childhood is gone and i wasn t able to save him and that completely breaks my heart in half . i mean listening to his music and his lyrics carefully you can tell he was in so much pain but yet no one offered to help him and that just shatters me i will always continue to wonder why no one helped him and that we could ve saved him and he would still be here with us that will always haunt me for the rest of my life . it s been one year and it s been been heartbreaking and devastating knowing that it s been one year since he s been gone . i don t even know how i made it knowing he s not here with us anymore but deep down i have this feeling he is here with us all the time in spirit so i guess that s how i made it this far without him . i just never knew how hard it was gonna be losing someone who meant the world to you and who made you strong and so happy and has helped you through life and continues to do so . i just never knew how hard that was until we lost chester . then i realized wow it is super hard losing someone you love like that . breaks my heart . and that piece of me that died is with him now in heaven . wow this is incredibly long guys i m sorry i just felt i had to . my childhood will never be the same and knowing that we will never hear new music by him honestly is the most devastating , heart shattering thing ever . like i lived for his music and all their albums and knowing their won t be new ones just breaks me even more . no more hearing chester in new songs god that is saddening . but i know that he s up in heaven now with all the angels as he is an angel himself watching over all of us and making sure we stay strong for him and keep his legacy alive forever which we will it s just harder now listening to his music every time i do a tear runs down my face because i just miss him so much and yes i know he will always be here with us but it s still very hard . anyways sorry y all this is so long but i just miss chester goodness sake","878393":"that s his issue not mine","878394":"i m a queen now ? cheers","878395":"oh
