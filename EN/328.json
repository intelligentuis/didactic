my car is chasing her tail again i m gonna watch this while i wait ."},"Answer":{"303400":"i don t think there s a zenith to where people reach the peak of their wisdom or maturity . as you get older , you constantly grow and evolve as a human , even when you re approaching upper ages . if you ask any elderly person , i m sure they would tell you that they still matured and learned things even during the latter years of their lives .","303401":"uh . . . since when is old ? ? lmaoo . i m approaching myself , my dude . nevertheless , people can use askfm as long as they re over the age of . there s no age cap when it comes to ask , and there are dozens of people who are on here . people are free to do what they want as long as they re not breaking the terms conditions .","303402":"i don t hate it , but i normally delete sexual questions because i don t answer that sort of thing on askfm .","303403":"i think it would be in terms of dating , yeah . how can you have fun with someone if you can t even laugh with them ? ? i m lucky in that all of my friends and my boyfriend make me laugh every time i m with them , idk if i would still be their friend if they had no sense of humor .","303404":"anyone have any questions ? ? i can t sleep .","303405":"yeah , we do . often we both find things funny that other people don t seem to find funny at all , so we re sitting there giggling like children while everyone else is just confused . lmao .","303406":"i remade my xbox avatar , the hair needed to be updated .","303407":"i haven t attended school since .","303408":"i disagree with the concept that women owe their partners sex people s bodies , regardless of their gender , are theirs and theirs alone . sex is not an obligation in a relationship , and sex also doesn t guarantee that a partner won t be unfaithful either . everyone s relationship is different , and some place more emphasis on sex than others . in cases where someone expects a lot of sex , then yeah they might look elsewhere if their needs aren t being satisfied ideally they should talk to their partner first , but we all know a lot of people would rather cheat than do that . however , that s between those two people and other people s opinions on an individual relationship are meaningless .","303409":"i m not saying it s right or wrong i m just offering you an explanation as to why celinem answers the way she does . not that you need any sort of justification , either way . personally speaking , i don t care if someone uses slang , poor grammar , etc etc . as long as i understand what they re trying to say then i ll answer the question within reason , lol . but you re the one who brought celine up in the first place because you re salty over the way she treats some anons which probably includes you , so now you re likely just angry because i refuse to participate in your sh t talking .","303410":"they re both slang , and it makes more sense to type how re you than how s you because that s how we re taught to speak . we re not taught to say how is you because that doesn t make much sense . ain t is also slang more prevalent to some areas of the country than others , and where celinem and i are from , nobody uses that term .","303411":"veggie burgers ! ! i prefer them over beef burgers , they re so much tastier and versatile .","303412":"celinem isn t uptight about grammar . celine just doesn t like when people go out of their way to make a sentence sound ridiculous when you can just as easily type it normally . it takes more effort to abbreviate everything and use slang than it does to just type regularly , and that s also something that has always confounded me .","303413":"is it really once again if we re talking about the same candle ? ? lmfaooo .","303414":"i would love to continue receiving your questions ! ! i hope you have a great new year . as a filler here s my view for the night . mike shinoda is blessing me with this cold , cozy beer .","303415":"yeah , but i m really picky on where i order it from or which brand to make .","303416":"depends on what they re ranting about , lmao . if it s something stupid that they really shouldn t complain about , then i ll hear them out but i won t enjoy it at all .","303417":"no . i don t care enough about other people s grammar to make assumptions in the first place . it s social media . grammar doesn t matter here , lol .","303418":"it depends if you guys are still on civil terms the general vibe between you two . however , in most cases i would think it isn t necessary and may only lead to complications in your relationship friendship whatever . especially if you bring up the breakup . you don t know how they feel about it so the conversation could turn ugly really fast . i would just avoid it entirely .","303419":"no , that s just unrealistic . there have been plenty of times where i was in the wrong , and there will be plenty of more times in the future where he will have to point out my behavior or thought processes and inform me that i m wrong . you shouldn t be in a relationship with a person who always insists that they re right even if they re absolutely wrong . it s a red flag and it can lead to manipulative behavior .","303420":"the dinosaur ? ? idk . chickens aren t the only animals that lay eggs , lmao .","303421":"eggs existed way before chickens did , so i m assuming the egg . dinosaurs were apparently hatched out of eggs .","303422":"not really . i don t care enough to get into arguments with people .","303423":"driving basically all aspects of driving , especially when it comes to other drivers and traffic and whatnot . it makes me so angry when people cut other people off , don t use their blinkers , assume they have the right of way when they don t , weave recklessly in and out of traffic , drive below the speed limit , etc etc .","303424":"i think it s a bit cliche , tbh . obviously it doesn t affect me personally so i shouldn t care , but i always thought that proposing on a holiday xmas or valentine s day especially was a bit corny .","303425":"i had two tastings of different beers a full sized pint of another kind of beer an ipa with hints of cherry vanilla .","303426":"i got to drink hang out with these cuties today ! !","303427":"mainly working . however , between yesterday today , my boyfriend and i took a mini vacation out to the vineyard region of long island . we went to a new brewery earlier this afternoon , which was a lot of fun .","303428":"well , i certainly hope my boyfriend likes me .","303429":"i think it depends entirely on circumstance . i don t bring my boyfriend around my family either , but my family knows that he exists obviously .","303430":"for the most part , yes . i also contribute when i can , though , for things such as groceries .","303431":"i don t believe he s single , actually . he s very closed off when it comes to his personal life for good reason , tbh . i have a feeling he has a girlfriend but doesn t want to tell my family .","303432":"yes , i think that would be hella interesting . it might also give me insight into who i am in this current life as well .","303433":"no , he s heterosexual .","303434":"i m not really poor because i have enough money to live comfortably , and it would be wrong for me to say i m poor considering there are so many other people who are worse off financially than me .","303435":"it isn t something i feel comfortable discussing . i d also appreciate it if you guys would stop asking me questions about death as well .","303436":"i have a sibling already , so this question doesn t pertain to me .","303437":"no . i already have an inkling of how i might die anyway .","303438":"in that case , it s a good thing that i don t believe hell exists then .","303439":"no , i m not afraid of death . i ve come too close to death too many times on my own accord to really be fearful of it . i ve already made my peace .","303440":"i don t know what i believe , tbh . i d like to think that our souls become reincarnated into another living creature , but there s also a part of me that just thinks we disintegrate into the earth .","303441":"my hair isn t a natural color i don t think anyone would take it , especially considering how short it is .","303442":"i m not religious i don t believe in sins .","303443":"tbh i would freak the f ck out if i found out that my hair was thinning . my hair is everything to me , lol . luckily i have a mop of really thick hair , so i don t have to worry about that happening .","303444":"it depends on what they did on their first chance . some people i m apt to forgive , but i won t forgive serious transgressions .","303445":"i ve surprisingly never heard any gossip about me . lol . i ve always maintained a low profile .","303446":"i don t go swimming .","303447":"no , i have no reason to wear a bikini .","303448":"i don t have any of those , and i wouldn t post one even if i did . my body is atrocious .","303449":"no . i don t answer sxxual questions .","303450":"i don t remember if i had any resolutions at the start of . i probably didn t because life tends to happen and a lot of people don t follow through with their resolutions , including me . i would rather set smaller goals for myself . i do want to start eating healthier than i currently am and start going back to the gym , or at least work out at home somehow . i fell off the wagon a few months ago and i ve been needing to get back to a fitness routine desperately .","303451":"i m most comfortable with the company of my boyfriend close friends , as well as one or two of my coworkers . i m not close with my family at all so i m not comfortable being around them , so i prefer the company of pretty much anyone else .","303452":"the last time i was surprised was on xmas eve . my boyfriend bought me three beautiful necklaces , and i basically had no idea what to do because i obviously can t wear all three at once , lol . i m going to rotate wearing them , but regardless , i was so surprised because they were all beautiful and he didn t have to go out of his way to buy me three different ones .","303453":"i believe in a right person , but i also believe that there are multiple right people when it comes to love . i disagree with the idea that everyone only has one soulmate , because there are countless people in this world and you re bound to have amazing connection with at least one person .","303454":"family feud is hilarious to me . i don t normally watch game shows but i ll watch it if i m scrolling see that its on .","303455":"drink ginger tea . it s one of the only things that helps me .","303456":"i don t believe i have , no .","303457":"i value my alone time and i enjoy it greatly , but there are also times where i need social interaction . even so , i m only comfortable around small groups of maybe people .","303458":"rum soaked cannoli cake ! ! although its only am rn , i can t even think about sweets without getting nauseous , lol .","303459":"i don t like picking favorites i enjoy reading the answers of everyone i follow , which is obviously why i follow them .","303460":"i swear occasionally , but i mostly refrain from swearing on askfm because i don t want my answers to get deleted .","303461":"no , none of my jobs had those .","303462":"probably , but i would really have to think about what i m going to say before i say it . swearing is second nature to me , lmao .","303463":"aw , thanks","303464":"is that when you see how many marshmallows you can shove into your mouth ? ? lmao .","303465":"no ? ? that s gross .","303466":"if you feel it s necessary , sure .","303467":"i don t know anyone who follows through with their resolutions . it s easier to take each step at a time rather than expect yourself to live up to an expectation .","303468":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303469":"i ll have to look it up ! ! i ve never heard of it before .","303470":"i usually notice their eyes and their smile .","303471":"i play poker with my boyfriend s friends , but those are the only card games i play .","303472":"no , i don t like her music at all .","303473":"my day dragged , but i got out of work early , so that s a plus i just got home and it isn t even pm yet . the only thing bothering me is that my stomach has been killing me ever since i ate lunch . i don t know what didn t agree with me since its all food i ve eaten before .","303474":"no , it isn t something that concerns me at the moment .","303475":"that s not cheating , and no , it doesn t anger me . my boyfriend texts his coworkers all the time everyone is allowed to talk to their friends , coworkers included . to tell someone that they can t text a certain person outside of work is hella controlling .","303476":"are you talking about the transformer that blew in queens which made the sky blue ? ? yeah i want to believe .","303477":"it wasn t offensive at all ! ! you raised some excellent points .","303478":"this too . i think they were mainly just trying to get a rise out of me , which obviously won t work . it doesn t offend me if people misgender me because it says a whole lot more about them than it does about me .","303479":"negative self talk , low self esteem , and some of the weight i ve gained over the past year , lol .","303480":"i ve heard that they can be domesticated , but idk if that necessarily means that they would be a good pet . i certainly hope so though , foxes are adorable .","303481":"pretty much all the time , yeah . sometimes it s difficult for me to balance my work life with my social life , although i do admit that it used to be a lot more difficult when i was also attending college .","303482":"contrary to popular belief , there is such a thing as a singular they . the ap stylebook updated their guidelines about a year ago stating that when someone has gender neutral pronouns , it s acceptable to refer to them as they them .","303483":"i m happily in a relationship .","303484":"i ve never followed through on my resolutions , so i prefer to make little goals throughout the year .","303485":"chocolate chip cookie dough ftw .","303486":"spending xmas eve with my boyfriend and his family was the highlight of my holiday thus far . this weekend , we re also going to visit a local brewery that has live music so that should be fun too .","303487":"i eat it occasionally , sure .","303488":"they re sooo good , omg . if you re ever in new york , order them from a bakery and they ll be the best cookies you ve ever eaten .","303489":"not really . the only desserts i eat are cannolis and rainbow cookies .","303490":"no , i m still wired from the red bull i drank this afternoon . lmao .","303491":"yes , i believe marriage can be a beautiful expression of love between two people .","303492":"these days , i ve been thinking about work since it consists of most of my time . assignments , deadlines , my commute , etc etc . otherwise , i m thinking about my boyfriend , my friends , coffee , and alcohol . my mind is always reeling , although it s gotten a lot better over the last few months .","303493":"i know absolutely nothing about canada .","303494":"no , half of the time i have no clue who they are .","303495":"no , i go to my friend who s a hair stylist and she does it for me .","303496":"i don t have any plans . i don t normally do anything for new years eve .","303497":"not everyone enjoys being complimented . personally , i only like compliments from my boyfriend close friends .","303498":"everyone has likes dislikes . i personally dislike adjectives that are feminine , i . e . beautiful , gorgeous , etc etc .","303499":"it depends on what they said after the initial statement . in most cases , the person prefaces their thoughts with don t take this the wrong way when they already know that what they think is potentially offensive , but they want to say it anyway .","303500":"please don t call me beautiful , i dislike that adjective . this weekend should be fun , though . my boyfriend and i are driving out east to the vineyards tomorrow night , and we re going to a brewery on saturday where there will be live music .","303501":"plenty of times , yeah . one person in particular always deflects blame onto other people and never takes responsibility for their own actions .","303502":"yeah , my family has a smart doorbell that takes pictures of videos when there are movements at the door .","303503":"a footnote is a citation placed at the bottom of a page of text that sources where a piece of evidence or information comes from .","303504":"the last question i deleted was one of ben s white supremacist nonsense statements . i don t block questions or people on askfm .","303505":"lmao , what . first off , you re anonymous . secondly , i m already in a relationship .","303506":"no , i ve never had deliveries stolen from me before .","303507":"hell yes that s basically my dream right there .","303508":"i m on break at work and i really don t want to go back inside in minutes to continue working , lol . i might buy a red bull to keep myself focused .","303509":"i m an extremely heavy sleeper . the only thing that wakes me up is my alarm in the morning .","303510":"i don t have either , but i bought my father an echo for xmas .","303511":"no , i have no reason to buy anything right now .","303512":"there s nothing i m really looking forward to in yet .","303513":"i was in my party stage between the ages of and , for the most part . i would get drunk almost every night and then i eventually grew out of the stage . idk why i started to begin with i guess it had to do with the fact that i never wanted to be home and i was always angry and depressed .","303514":"nah , i m good . likes are meaningless .","303515":"i don t follow people upon request .","303516":"i m not sure my psychiatrist told me at some point that it didn t have any interaction with my medication , so i was free to drink in moderation . idk if i necessarily believe her because i m on four different medications , but it doesn t really seem to affect me physically , so i ve just kept drinking .","303517":"aaaahhh , you re making me crave a cheese and meat platter now to go with my wine , lol .","303518":"i definitely will thanks for the heads up ! !","303519":"wow , that s awesome . i think there s one about minutes away from me , but it s in a city that i never visit and it doesn t seem really worth it for me to go there when there are so many other grocery stores closer to me .","303520":"i ve never been a fan of that name , it sounds like a little girl s name to me , lol .","303521":"i don t believe i have , no . but they sell the bottles in liquor stores around here , and my boyfriend s family always has them in the house .","303522":"i haven t , but i ll have to check it out ! ! i ve only been to trader joe s once in my life .","303523":"i went to work today , and then i went home , did some organizing of leftover gifts for my father he wasn t home for xmas this year , ate dinner , and put on a charcoal face mask .","303524":"yeah , i do . the only people who know my middle name are my close friends boyfriend , though .","303525":"the dreaming tree cabernet sauvignon . i also really love the local wines from long island , like pindar and martha clara vineyards .","303526":"i m fairly healthy , but i do eat unhealthy food on occasion . i had a bag of chips today after lunch , for example .","303527":"i m pretty neutral towards it it isn t my child , so i don t really care about what someone names their children .","303528":"i don t have a cat . but if i had one , i d probably name them luna .","303529":"i only eat boneless wings .","303530":"if you take care of your hair correctly , coloring your hair shouldn t damage it at all . split ends are normal , anyway , and they occur even if someone doesn t color their hair .","303531":"uh , my name is leigh . don t call me that . i m fine , though . i m just going to relax with a glass of wine and some netflix before going to bed later .","303532":"no , i never have before . i have no desire to have one either .","303533":"no , i didn t go to parties when i was in high school .","303534":"uh , no . i m not violent like that .","303535":"i m not offended by much of anything these days . i ve learned to distance myself from the opinions of others because i realized that it s just a reflection of who they are , not of who i am . they require education and maturity , if anything . i don t really make jokes about controversial things , but i do talk about death svicide a lot regarding myself and it can be awkward if i accidentally do it in front of someone who doesn t know me well , lmao .","303536":"true crime documentaries , video games particularly open world rpgs , literature writing , art , good music , alcohol , coffee , mental health awareness , and cosmetics .","303537":"it varies from person to person . some people prefer feeling cozy and comfortable with their partner , while others prefer exciting adventures and always trying something new . and then there are people who like both and find a way to be both comfortable in their relationship while still taking time out to do new and exciting things .","303538":"it was fine quiet and easy , there was no traffic today so i got to and from work without any issues at all , and i was able to completely catch up on my assignments . i got home about mins ago so i m just drinking coffee and watching netflix rn .","303539":"no , i don t believe in love at first sight . love is something deep and intimate that occurs after you ve gotten to know someone . what people think is love at first sight is just lust .","303540":"my room is upstairs , and it gets freezing in the winter and boiling hot in the summer .","303541":"if i m in the mood for one , then sure . sometimes i m too exhausted and burnt out for challenges , though .","303542":"i got my stubborn nature from my mother , and i inherited my father s sense of intellect and logic .","303543":"i ve worn glasses due to poor eyesight since i was a child , lol . i prefer black rimmed glasses .","303544":"i post selfies on askfm and other various pictures nothing that s personal .","303545":"because i don t want strangers viewing my photos or my stories .","303546":"nope , i have a screen protector ! !","303547":"poetalunam , same as here .","303548":"it s basing the value of the car off of sxx appeal , so in a way , yes . it s reducing women to their physical characteristics .","303549":"i wouldn t know , i ve only purchased cars from male sales representatives . either way , as long as the person is knowledgeable about cars , it shouldn t matter how attractive they are .","303550":"i usually complete them first just to get them out of the way that way , the remaining tasks don t seem as daunting .","303551":"thank you so much ! ! i hope your holiday was fantastic .","303552":"idk who even follows me on askfm , lol . either way , i don t care about followers because i ve always just posted whatever i want to post .","303553":"lmao . no , it was clearly a joke .","303554":"while i appreciate the sentiment , this isn t a question .","303555":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303556":"lol . i don t have it posted anywhere , i m paranoid of people seeing it seeing where i live and stuff . but aw , you re too sweet . ?","303557":"lmao . it s a big , ceramic cat that s a tissue holder you pull the tissues out of the cat s butt . i thought she would laugh at it , but she almost cried because she loves cats so much and thought it was beautiful . for some reason .","303558":"apparently i am everyone loved what i got for them this year , and my aunt almost cried when she opened my gift to her because she loved it so much ironically enough , it was supposed to be a joke gift but she fell in love with it , lmao .","303559":"i honestly have no idea because i got a few really awesome things this year my boyfriend bought me a beautiful necklace that i ll probably be wearing for a while , and his father his fianc e also bought me a mindfulness journal ! ! my parents additionally got me fallout goodbye social life ! !","303560":"no , nobody from askfm gave me an xmas gift . i was actually going to get courrtana a gift from her amazon wishlist , but by the time i remembered , it wouldn t have been delivered to her on time for xmas .","303561":"not at all . i don t expect gifts from people , the only things i actually asked for were fallout and new foundation , since i ran out of my other bottle .","303562":"sometimes , but usually only when i m high , lol .","303563":"if i was bragging about getting gifts , then yeah that would be spoiled behavior . but i only answered one question about which gifts i got , so idk how that makes me spoiled .","303564":"what was your question ? ?","303565":"i agree with you that s why i said something along the lines of saying yes at first and then saying no and everything else in that answer . i don t give my boyfriend a resounding yes either sometimes , but it s a mutual agreement and he knows that if i hesitate , say yes and then say no after a while , or don t give him a straight answer , then it s also a no and not consent .","303566":"no . i m happily in a relationship have no desire to be with anyone else .","303567":"to each their own ! ! everyone has their own likes and dislikes , and i personally find issue with kinks that involve child r pe and adult r pe because it s making light of trauma survivors struggles with those things . tbh i like being choked , but . . . that s all i m ever going to say about this , lmao .","303568":"i don t agree with the whole aspect of pretending to r pe someone because that s also f cked up in my opinion , but i don t see any issue with choking kinks .","303569":"leggings and an oversized hoodie .","303570":"consent consent consent . everything is about consent . hesitation is not consent . i don t know is not consent . not saying anything is not consent . being drunk is not consent . being high is not consent . saying yes at first and then saying no is not consent . the only thing consent is , is an unresounding , explicit yes .","303571":"my boyfriend bought me this necklace , which is absolutely beautiful i love it so much .","303572":"i ll take some questions ! ! i just finished up xmas with my family , so i ll be bored for the rest of the night .","303573":"it s worse than choking kinks because you re literally pretending to be a child in order to play out your kink . . . children can t consent to sxxual activity and its making light of inc stuous things , which is all kinds of f cked up . choking kinks are consensual , so it s completely different . you re consenting to that activity and couples have a safe word to ensure safety .","303574":"thanks , you as well ! !","303575":"not really , but that s because i ate a lot last night so i wasn t hungry at all today . i only had a few cannolis with my coffee this morning , and for dinner i had sushi .","303576":"yes ! ! i might bring it to work with me , it s such a cool mug .","303577":"yes , my day has been good ! ! my family just finished up doing xmas things , so now i m relaxing with a cup of coffee and i might open a bottle of wine .","303578":"not necessarily . love for friends and family is just as important , if not more important , than romantic love . it depends on the person .","303579":"ahh , thank you ! !","303580":"my parents did . my boyfriend s father and his fianc e also got me some makeup too .","303581":"a few makeup items eyeshadow palette , foundation , and concealer , some clothing , fallout , an instant camera , a makeup mirror , a harry potter mug , and an over the shoulder bag .","303582":"i got my mother two books , personalized trivets for the kitchen , a box of tea , lemon scented hand soap , and a stand for her phone . i got my father a sweatshirt and an alexa device . i got my brother a onesie , a make your own hot sauce kit , a beard kit , and a short sleeved shirt .","303583":"a personalized love book , four different scented candles , three boxes of various teas , a long sleeved shirt , a short sleeved shirt , a sweatshirt , and a mug .","303584":"i m literally wearing leggings and an oversized hoodie , lmao .","303585":"picking something that s the worst is a bit ungrateful because regardless of whether or not you like something , that person still went out of their way to think of you and spend money on you . i m grateful for everything i got this year .","303586":"i didn t open gifts from my family yet , but my boyfriend and his family got me some books , a few necklaces and makeup , and a funko tomb raider toy ! !","303587":"? merry xmas happy holidays to all of my followers ! ! i hope y all have a wonderful day ! ! ?","303588":"hello nothing much just finished up having breakfast with my boyfriend s family , so now him and i are going to sit down for a little while before i have to go back home .","303589":"why not ? ?","303590":"idk what my horoscope is . however , my astrological sign is scorpio .","303591":"if i had enough money to go on a shopping spree , then i would use that money towards my bills tbh . if i can t use it toward bills , then i would probably buy myself a new wardrobe , a lot of coffee , a few video games , and makeup .","303592":"i m hungover af right now , rofl . i m looking forward to having some coffee with my boyfriend and his family in a few minutes .","303593":"yes ! ! thank you for bringing that up , i totally agree with you .","303594":"i have a samsung galaxy s .","303595":"merry xmas to you too ! !","303596":"mac and cheese bites , and a crispy chicken sandwich with fries from outback steakhouse .","303597":"merry xmas to you too ! !","303598":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303599":"i over ate and now i feel absolutely disgusting . ugh .","303600":"the best thing you can honestly do is overcome that initial fear and hang out with them you ll get more comfortable over time . the anxiety really does suck but you ll feel better once you re with them .","303601":"it s different for everyone . i realized i loved my boyfriend when i would be willing to go the extra mile in order to make him happy .","303602":"you re essentially pretending to be a child and putting it in a sxxual context not to mention the fact that it makes light of inc st and other trauma that some people go through and creates a kink out of people s trauma . it s gross .","303603":"i m sorry you re feeling this way i ve been in the same boat myself , although with mental illness not physical illness . i know how horrible and isolating it feels to get so low that you contemplate ending your life . have you tried seeking professional counseling to help you handle your thoughts ? ? physical health undoubtedly affects mental health and its always healthy to pursue mental health treatment especially if you think you re in danger .","303604":"no , i like to save money on things but i m not stingy or greedy when it comes to my money . you can always earn more , the way i see it , and it s worth spending money on experiences and things that make you happy as long as it won t be damaging to you .","303605":"making my friends and boyfriend happy . the best thing for me is watching them open their presents and enjoying what i got them , and overall just spending time with everyone .","303606":"i m accepting of people s kinks within reason the only thing i ll frankly kink shame is ddlg things because i think it s absolutely disgusting .","303607":"my hair is currently half shaved and cut short , although i have had it shorter than this before .","303608":"i m in a relationship , but i value honesty , loyalty , and a sense of humor . i need someone who will make me laugh on a regular basis and someone who is obviously trustworthy , whom i can tell anything to .","303609":"no , that s never happened to me before . i m rarely in situations where people have the opportunity to ask me to have sex with them , lol .","303610":"aw , merry xmas to you too ! !","303611":"i m wearing sneakers currently .","303612":"sometimes i m ready for bed by pm because i m so tired from work , lol .","303613":"nothing , my family isn t exchanging gifts until tomorrow afternoon so i can thankfully sleep in tomorrow .","303614":"it s a commercial holiday for us , we don t celebrate religion even though my parents are catholic .","303615":"there isn t enough room in his house for me , lol . there are already five people living there .","303616":"it s a tie between skyrim and fallout .","303617":"long sleeves . it s about degrees fahrenheit outside .","303618":"i don t have any photos of me with long hair actually .","303619":"yeah , i took some photos while my hair was processing and posted them to my instagram story .","303620":"i first started cutting it short when i was years old , i think .","303621":"yes , i have one brother .","303622":"my stress management usually consists of me venting to my boyfriend or best friend , or drinking excessively .","303623":"happy holidays to you as well ! ! thank you for the well wishes","303624":"aw , thank you so much ! ! i hope you have a terrific holiday as well .","303625":"i d be a damn cool year old then .","303626":"so often ? ? i did it this past weekend then i did it in september . those have been the only times i saw this stylist . it also doesn t cost much money to get your hair done like this , so it isn t exactly a big hit on my bank account . it wouldn t make much of a difference .","303627":"my stylist came through with the badass hair photos ! !","303628":"you re not obligated to be friends with anyone . if someone is giving you a bad vibe then you have to do what you need to preserve yourself and protect yourself . whether that means telling them you can t be friends , ignoring and blocking them , etc etc . it depends on the situation .","303629":"i like general tso s chicken , but i rarely have it .","303630":"i ll definitely look into it ! ! i ve always wanted to try it but never knew where to order it from or if i would even like it , haha .","303631":"i ve never tried ramen before , actually .","303632":"my best friend came back to new york earlier than i expected , so i m going to be able to exchange gifts and see her tonight ! ! i m so enthralled ! !","303633":"it was so heartwarming to see my friends last night and do a small gift exchange with them when we were at the bar . we didn t even talk about buying each other gifts beforehand , it just sorta happened and we all somehow found a night to meet up and exchange . i guess buying them their gifts was a good deed , lol . it was so nice to see them open their gifts and have such great reactions .","303634":"somewhat . i don t usually feel the xmas spirit but i do enjoy and look forward to watching my family and friends open their gifts .","303635":"the only person who can guaranteed make me smile if i m not feeling well is my boyfriend . he always somehow finds a way to make me smile or laugh even when i m in the darkest throes of depression .","303636":"i have no idea what you re talking about . however , any question is appreciated as long as it isnt invasive or inappropriate .","303637":"no , it s only pm on sunday night here .","303638":"it depends on my mood . sometimes i prefer to be in the company of friends while other times i need solitude .","303639":"oh , lol . i usually only get hate when it comes to my smoking habit which is why i assumed it was a judgey question . originally i started smoking to calm myself down because of stress and anxiety , and then i became addicted to nicotine . they still calm me down when i m really stressed and upset though .","303640":"lmao , you re not obligated to know anything . get outta here with that entitlement .","303641":"i suppose i m a fast eater . i m usually one of the first people to finish their plate when i m eating around people , and most of the time i dislike the prospect of eating so i just try to get it over with .","303642":"it snowed early november , from what i remember . we ended up getting i think inches before thanksgiving .","303643":"i had a bacon , egg , and cheese sandwich this morning for breakfast . that was probably nine hours ago .","303644":"i like looking at the snow because it s pretty , but i absolutely hate driving in it .","303645":"i m not discussing the reasons why on askfm . i just need a distraction to calm me down .","303646":"i m extremely upset and desperately trying to find ways to distract myself . someone please send me questions .","303647":"uh . . . you re literally an anon on a social media website . lmfao . the chances of you making someone fall in love with you is extremely low , if not impossible .","303648":"i know , it s ridiculous . i wish apartments were more affordable around here .","303649":"no , he lives with his family .","303650":"i don t know what you mean he isn t doing anything for me when we hang out , they re group activities lol .","303651":"free to do whatever we want to do usually that consists of playing video games , watching netflix youtube , taking care of his pets , reading , etc etc","303652":"evidently there s some sort of language barrier here .","303653":"i n doing well . i m just laying in bed and thinking about taking a nap rn .","303654":"this . . . is not a word . nor a question .","303655":"because i want to .","303656":"i m finally done wrapping xmas gifts thank god . ask me questions y all","303657":"usually my boyfriend s house is that escape from reality for me . when we re in his room , everyone leaves us alone and we can do whatever we want without interruption . it s a drastic and nice change from my life at my own house because i m constantly being interrupted and i have no time to myself .","303658":"it isn t something i ve ever paid much attention to .","303659":"i think , coffee , chair , aunt , and some other words that i can t recall .","303660":"i guess i have a typical new york accent , lol . when i lived in massachusetts , my friends would tell me that i sounded like i was from new york or long island , and they would poke fun at the way i pronounced certain words .","303661":"my day has been good so far ! ! it s only am and i ve only been awake for like two hours , but it s been productive . i slept over my boyfriend s house after we went out last night , and after i got up , i grabbed coffee on the way home and made myself breakfast . i ve just basically been relaxing and drinking my coffee so far . when i m done , i m going to finish wrapping xmas gifts .","303662":"i don t remember where i got it from . probably old navy , tbh .","303663":"no , i stole it . lmao . of course i bought it .","303664":"well , this got awkward really fast . you don t know anything about me and i m not anyone s dream . i also have a partner already so this effort is pretty futile . go hit on someone else .","303665":"thank you ! ! i m so obsessed with it omg . i can t wait to get the official photos back from my stylist .","303666":"just be there for them if they need you . tell them that you re here to support them if they need help and don t hesitate to reach out to you if they need anything at all . allow them to talk and vent .","303667":"i ve had to give statements to the police before , but i ve never testified in court . there were a few crimes theft committed in my store when i worked in retail so the police came and questioned the employees a few times .","303668":"not gonna lie . . . i was rocking out to mariah carey s all i want for xmas is you two nights ago while driving home from work

it doesn t mean i ll answer your question . this is one of those questions that i don t answer .","303672":"obsessed .","303673":"my best friend recently moved to another state and i thought i wouldn t be able to exchange gifts with her this year because she didn t know if she would be able to come back to new york for xmas . i just received a package in the mail , and she ended up ordering me a skyrim fleece blanket off of amazon and sent it to my house . i m crying happy tears , that was so sweet of her and i love it so much .","303674":"i ve never experienced lumbago before , lol .","303675":"i used to only wash my face with warm water , but lately my skin has been feeling oily so i ve been using black charcoal facial scrub in the shower a moisturizer when i get out of the shower . they ve been making my face feel so clean .","303676":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope you have a wonderful holiday yourself .","303677":"in my free time , i usually play video games , hang out with friends , read , write , and sometimes paint .","303678":"i usually order the salmon avocado rolls and the spicy tuna rolls .","303679":"i ve been obsessed with sushi lately .","303680":"probably not , solely because of my job . i need the internet for work .","303681":"thank you ! !","303682":"he died yesterday , but he ll forever be my baby . rip shadow .","303683":"they re uncomfortable , for the most part . i also have no reason to wear them because i never go swimming or to the beach .","303684":"they re all horrible . i hate swim suits .","303685":"breaking the habit by linkin park https youtu . be v h l rpkwm","303686":"i m rational most of the time , but there are also moments where i act irrationally . when i m irrational or impulsive then i don t care about the consequences of my actions . that only happens sometimes though , otherwise i do care .","303687":"i dress mainly for comfort these days although sometimes i dress more fashionably . lately i ve been wearing hoodies and jeans , but i also wear skinny jeans and boots , cardigans and sweaters , scarves , beanies , etc etc . my clothing from black craft cult expresses my personality the most , i believe . it s dark colored and has really awesome graphics on it .","303688":"reanswering because i took better photos . it s amazing ! ! i m waiting for my stylist to send me the photos she took with her camera so here s a selfie for now","303689":"last night . my pet fish died .","303690":"yeah , i go twice a year .","303691":"i ve only done that with my boyfriend .","303692":"slams my fist into my skull","303693":"i hope i didn t jinx myself by saying this , lmfao .","303694":"i would rather buy them , lol . i m not crafty at all .","303695":"i ve actually never had a toothache before .","303696":"uh , yes . lmao . but it isn t enough to get me arrested .","303697":", .","303698":"no , i don t think i have streaks with anyone at the moment .","303699":"i only really use the same two or three filters when i use snapchat , lol . most of them are advertisements or a bit ridiculous .","303700":"not really , failure is a natural part of life and it happens to everyone eventually . it should be motivation to work harder and try better .","303701":"not very often , but when i do , i spend a lot at a time . for example , i spent way too much money for xmas gifts this year .","303702":"depends on the decision . i m impulsive in general especially when it comes to drinking and spending money , but bigger decisions require more thought .","303703":"no , i ve never been catfished nor have i ever catfished someone .","303704":"my gut is rarely wrong , so i usually follow my gut instincts .","303705":"it s helpful that , even if the car is used , it has a new engine , new tires , etc etc . otherwise you re just going to run into problems super quickly . i don t really remember much else because i haven t bought a used car in like six years .","303706":"crushes are normally innocent things , so i believe they re real crushes . you grow to be attracted to a celebrity due to their looks or what you know of their personality . it isn t much different than having a crush on someone irl .","303707":"i know you re not the same dude , lol . but you re the person who felt the need to anonymously make a wild claim that makes absolutely no sense in an effort to discredit me .","303708":"i like olive garden s dressing idk what it actually is and i also use ranch dressing .","303709":"i like cherries , usually in my alcoholic drinks . lol .","303710":"i don t think i ve ever read it , no .","303711":"not being able to breathe , ugh . i can deal with the coughing and sneezing , but when you can t breathe and you re trying to sleep at night , then it s absolute hell .","303712":"lol . what the hell . if you re offended that i used the word force to describe a friendship then i m pretty sure i m not the snowflake here .","303713":"i m pretty damn good at destiny .","303714":"productive .","303715":"venti vanilla sweet cream cold brew .","303716":"uh , no ? ? you can t force friendship . it s supposed to happen naturally over time .","303717":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303718":"same ! ! well , i only met linkin park once when i was like years old , but it was also a highlight of my life . i got the opportunity to tell chester how much him and his music meant to me , and it was such an amazing moment .","303719":"i love him . i got the chance to meet him a few months ago during a poster signing at a local record store , and it was one of the best moments of my life .","303720":"the only jesus i worship is mike shinoda .","303721":"the whole females are bad drivers thing is a false stereotype , actually . someone s ability to drive isn t determined by their sex or gender . i m a really cautious driver due to my anxiety , but unfortunately that isn t enough to prevent certain accidents .","303722":"lol . yeah , new york drivers are ridiculous particularly city drivers and drivers from long island .","303723":"yes , i ve been in quite a few . thankfully none of them were my fault nor was i injured , but getting into those accidents have only made my anxiety worse because you never know when an accident can happen .","303724":"the probability of getting into an accident and getting hurt is so high , and it plagues me every day . there are also the moments where i get the impulse to do something erratic on the road , so sometimes i don t trust myself driving which makes my anxiety worse .","303725":"driving is my biggest source of anxiety , actually .","303726":"honestly , you re better off without it because of the effect alcohol can have on diabetes , especially a c levels . it s nice to have a drink on special occasions , but unfortunately with diabetes , everything is affected and you re better off without it in the long run .","303727":"he doesn t drink usually , and when he does , he usually orders a captain diet coke . he hasn t drank beer in a really long time because it raises his blood sugar too much .","303728":"i totally understand this . my boyfriend is a type one diabetic so he always watches what he eats and has to give himself insulin accordingly . the holidays makes it harder .","303729":"lol . enjoy your holiday and your drinks ! ! i m low key jealous . i could go for an ice cold beer rn .","303730":"depends on the night . it s anywhere between pm and am .","303731":"the only celebrities i ve met have been the members of linkin park , and they were all incredibly nice .","303732":"veggie burgers ! !","303733":"my day was fine . the best part of the day was getting out of work at pm and being able to drive home in the daylight , lol . i just made myself some dinner and i might watch netflix soon .","303734":"i like chocolate , but i m not obsessed with it like some people are . i prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate i can only have it in really small quantities .","303735":"i generally don t . however , my best friend puts cinnamon in her ground coffee before she makes a pot it tastes delicious .","303736":"no , i ve never traveled outside of the united states before .","303737":"sleeping in not having to set an alarm ! ! i usually wake up around or am anyway , but it s a hell of a lot better than being forced to wake up at am .","303738":"rofl , no . i dislike trump for obvious reasons , but i don t hate him . hatred is meant for something personal .","303739":"i d rather not discuss that on here . it isn t anyone who uses askfm , though .","303740":"no , there s only one person in my life who i can say i genuinely hate .","303741":"every gift is a real gift , lol . besides , secret santa isn t supposed to be all that serious and a lot of people got amusing gifts . it was a lot of fun .","303742":"my supervisor got me as her person , so she bought me a mike shinoda prayer candle off of etsy , lol . i was so confused at first , and then i looked at the face and started laughing hysterically .","303743":"we did ! ! we exchanged gifts yesterday , actually . it was so much fun and definitely a great bonding experience to bring the entire department together .","303744":"ask me questions , friends ! ! i m bored af and willing to answer nearly anything .","303745":"uh . . . is this supposed to be an acronym for something ? ?","303746":"no . i m pretty neutral towards humanity . the only things i m certain that i love are people whom i m close with in my life .","303747":"no , i m sure that most people are certainly loved by at least one person , whether it s friends or family or significant others .","303748":"i m assuming this was supposed to be some sort of poetic statement , but instead it came out as intensely creepy and horrifying . great job , dude .","303749":"i would advise against that . i kinda need them to see , and also that would taste absolutely horrid .","303750":"no . the older i get , the more i realize that upper ages aren t as old as i used to think they were when i was younger .","303751":"that doesn t surprise me . people have told me that i m intimidating before .","303752":"i ll have to see if any of my friends are doing anything for new years eve . i requested off from work because i wanted the four day weekend the office is closed on new years day , but i don t have any plans to celebrate yet . usually i celebrate with my boyfriend , but i think he s working until pm on new years eve and again starting at am the next morning , so i m not sure if i ll get to see him .","303753":"i m not dreading it at all because i know i m going to feel better when i m finished . i just feel incredibly lazy burnt out from work so i don t feel like doing a damn thing atm .","303754":"organizing boxes and cleaning . yeah , that s going to be oodles of fun .","303755":"there s a comedian whom i saw perform live a few months ago , his name is dan soder i think that s his name . he has a really dark sense of humor and i was cracking up at his comedy show .","303756":"i m doing well . my office let us leave at pm instead of pm today , which was really nice . i was able to sort through some boxes when i got home in order to see what i bought people for xmas and separate them accordingly . right now , i m just drinking some coffee and checking up on social media . i m going to listen to music and clean in a little bit .","303757":"everything , lmao . some of the things that really bother me , though , are people who spread ignorance without doing proper research first , especially if their ideologies are inherently racist , sexist , ableist , homophobic , transphobic , antisemitic , etc etc . i also really dislike when people feel entitled to certain privileges just for simply existing because they ve been spoiled rotten their entire lives , and they view other people who don t have the same privilege as inferior to them .","303758":"one of my friends is actually getting married today , and i m so happy for her her husband ! ! they re a beautiful couple and i wish i could take part in their celebration .","303759":"my boyfriend s resilience . he s endured so much hardship and struggle with a variety of things he still perseveres every day . he always puts percent into everything he does regardless of how he s feeling , and it s something i ve always admired about him .","303760":"that sounds like a recipe for disaster . if you ve ever seen the movie gattaca , you would understand why .","303761":"my coffee , lmao . don t even take a sip of it , that irritates me completely . if you want coffee , then get your damn own .","303762":"depends on my mood that day . sometimes i get annoyed really easily , while other times , nothing bothers me at all .","303763":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","303764":"perhaps if you stopped feeling sorry for yourself and sending this out to everyone every few weeks , you would actually have the confidence to obtain a girlfriend . seriously , stop spamming people with this nonsense . it s annoying af .","303765":"i was late to work a few weeks ago only by like five minutes , thankfully .","303766":"hell no , rofl . i find that so obnoxious .","303767":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303768":"depends on how much red is left over and what the other ombre color is . some colorists might be able to lift it all , while other times it can be a two step process . the color you decide to go next is up to you . i m coloring my hair blue and silver tomorrow .","303769":"tomorrow , i m shopping for gift bags wrapping paper and getting my hair colored in the afternoon . sunday , i might be opening xmas gifts with my family . if not , then we re doing that on xmas eve . tuesday is xmas , so i m spending it with my boyfriend s family . monday , wednesday , thursday , and friday , i m going to work .","303770":"no , i ve never been fired before .","303771":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303772":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303773":"new york .","303774":"i don t have any plans to quit smoking currently .","303775":"i d probably know it if i heard it .","303776":"i have one car .","303777":"that s interesting , i never thought about it that way before .","303778":"i don t really see the point in having two cars unless you re fixing one up and using the other car for traveling .","303779":"some people like to take their aggression out on others when they re stressed out in their lives .","303780":"go right ahead ! ! lmao . i ve only ever met like three cats that were easy to live with .","303781":"i d rather have two oversized dogs than six cats .","303782":"lol . we might as well at this point that s why when i m looking up the definitions of words , i look them up from a variety of different sources because sometimes other sources take cultural significance into account while others don t .","303783":"is it more reliable to base a definition on years of study in multiple disciplines or on a single sentence in a dictionary that likely hasn t been updated in decades ? ? there are a lot of words whose definitions have changed with time . that s just the way language naturally progresses .","303784":"i disagree with them . that isn t what the cultural definition of what racism entails .","303785":"i m sitting on my bed , but that s the extent of it .","303786":"lol . yeah , it happens every now and again .","303787":"ugh , my previous answer got deleted . either way , if you don t have anything valuable to add to this , then i m going to delete your further messages . i already made my point clear .","303788":"i answered a similar question earlier , but i m just listening to music and answering questions rn . i m happy that tomorrow is friday , at least . i ve been so burnt out from work that it s going to feel nice to have a weekend .","303789":"thanks , my dude","303790":"we re literally going around in circles , lmao . i ll repeat myself if a black person commits a crime against another person of color due to their race , then yes , that s racist . however , if a black person commits a crime against a white person , then no , that isn t racist . that s discriminatory . idk how to make it anymore clear than that . and i m debating on not responding to you anymore because this is the same conversation over and over again , and you re not understanding .","303791":"it s historical just because there s one incident where the justice system does the right thing doesn t mean that oppression doesn t exist anymore . regardless of what the law decides , oppression still exists and is defined by history at least in this country . it s universal .","303792":"uh , yeah i can because oppression is based on years upon years of historical context . just because there are a few outcomes that are justifiable doesn t mean oppression doesn t exist anymore .","303793":"i said the other day that i didn t know if i had a cold or not . regardless , i m still feeling the same as i did yesterday or the day before , lol .","303794":"my day was good , actually . i described it in more detail a few answers below , but basically my office had a secret santa gift exchange and it was a lot of fun . now i m just listening to music and drinking hot cocoa . i m also waiting to hear back from my friend to see if we re going out tonight .","303795":"yeah . but a white person doesn t face oppression for being white so they don t experience racism . they can be discriminated against due to being white , but that isn t oppression .","303796":"i don t really consider myself a member of any fandom , although i am a fan of a lot of different things . particularly , linkin park mike shinoda , harry potter , lord of the rings , certain video games , certain tv shows , etc etc . the only reason why i don t think i belong to their fandoms is because i m not completely involved in maintaining connections with those fandoms . i call myself a fan of them , but i m not part of the fandom .","303797":"i honestly just don t think you re understanding where i m coming from , which is understandable . sometimes things sound more logical in my head compared to when i try to write them down . i m simply trying to make the distinction to you of the difference between racism and discrimination . ideally , those should be outcomes of both of those situations . however , it makes me wonder if the black person on trial would be given the death sentence as opposed to a life sentence because of the bias involved in the criminal justice system .","303798":"i haven t watched any new movies at all however , i have started watching the innocent man on netflix , which is really good ! ! if any of you guys love true crime docuseries like making a murderer , then i highly suggest it .","303799":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","303800":"i don t see why families shouldn t be allowed to bring their children to public places like restaurants and movie theaters . children need to be exposed to the world and be given opportunities to be shown right vs wrong behavior .","303801":"i don t anticipate it being much different than it is right now , besides the small goals i have set for myself come after the holidays . i ve learned not to place expectations on my own life when so much of it is out of my own control .","303802":"disloyalty whether that s in the form of extreme lying , cheating , etc etc . i don t tolerate any sort of relationship , platonic or romantic , where i can t trust the other person because they re not being loyal to me .","303803":"the definition of words do change over time , and there s nothing wrong with that . while in the past it may have also applied to white people , but further studies into racism as a whole have revealed that it s a system of oppression , much like sexism . white people have never been oppressed due to their race , which is why they can t experience racism . obviously white people do face discrimination because of a number of things , race included , but the racism is fundamentally different than discrimination .","303804":"i haven t received an advent calendar since i was a child . regardless , i remember the chocolate being hard and gross so i was never a fan of them to begin with , lmao .","303805":"rose petals , gasoline , firewood , jasmine , patchouli , and the crisp scent of cold winter air .","303806":"heathers , girl interrupted , and the crow .","303807":"yes , i ve attended several job interviews . i was offered the job with all of the interviews i went on , so it was just a matter of me choosing which job i wanted to go with .","303808":"my day has been fun , actually ! ! we had a secret santa gift exchange at work during lunch today , so i got to see my person open his gift and i also got to open the gift someone else bought me . i got home not too long ago , and right now i m just listening to music and drinking hot cocoa .","303809":"i can eat cold pizza , but i don t really enjoy it . it s usually hangover food for me tbh , especially since i m too lazy at that point to heat it in the microwave for a minute , lol . i ve never tried cold mac n cheese , but that sounds pretty gross .","303810":"i didn t give an excuse to not do sports when i was in grade school , at least in terms of gym class . i always did whatever sports we were supposed to do for the minutes we were in class .","303811":"people of color may have equal rights as it pertains to written law , such as having voting rights , but often that isn t how the law is interpreted in court . there s a lot of bias in the justice system regarding people of color , particularly black people , and often people who commit the same crimes who are white end up getting lesser sentences . regarding your second statement , discrimination is favoring one thing in this case race over the other . racism , on the other hand , is a system of oppression based upon a person s race that basically isn t white .","303812":"no , i only ever really use my phone when i get a notification from askfm , facebook , instagram , etc etc . i m not generally sitting there scrolling through social media unless i have a lot of time to kill . in addition , i don t have cell phone service in my office building , so my phone is set to airplane mode for the majority of the day .","303813":"i don t think i m good looking or wise , so neither ? ? if i had to make a choice , i would probably say wise simply because i ve been through some hardship and have learned valuable lessons from them . i don t think i m an attractive person at all .","303814":"yes , this year has gone incredibly fast ! ! i can t believe came and went already , and every time i try to think back on it , i can t really remember much of what has happened at all . i feel as if all i did was go to work , lmao . however , the fact that i ve been at my job for more than a year now and it hasn t felt that long at all is probably a good thing .","303815":"i used to enjoy watching national geographic documentaries , but i haven t sat down to watch one in years . i heard planet earth was a really wonderful docuseries , though .","303816":"i don t know your friend , nor do i know you , so i have no clue if his messages even mean something at all . if he s not responding to you , he could simply be busy . if this is something that s bothering you , then ask him about it . you re not going to get anywhere by refusing to bring the issue up to him .","303817":"that wouldn t coincide with racism because the law doesn t discriminate against white people based on their skin color in fact , it often works in their favor , but it certainly is a breach of justice .","303818":"i ve had a few people come to me when they ve been struggling , both online and in real life . how i comfort them depends entirely on their situation and how they currently feel , because those factors dictate what i say to them , how i say it , etc etc . generally speaking , i allow them to vent as much as they need to . i also encourage them to seek professional help in the form of therapy if that s something they agree that they should do in order to help sort out their issues . i encourage them to seek creative outlets , i . e . writing out their feelings , music , working out , etc etc . i also remind them that they ve come this far and they can overcome anything they set their mind to .","303819":"depends on whether or not you re civil with your ex . every circumstance is going to be different , but if you two are still on speaking terms , then it s probably better for the child to still celebrate holidays together .","303820":"in my bed , haha . if this can even be considered a selfie .","303821":"my boyfriend is the closest person to me who knows everything about me .","303822":"i can t afford to care less about grammar , considering it s my job lol . outside of work , it isn t something that concerns me . however , it s extremely important to my job so i always make sure i m aware of new changes .","303823":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303824":"aw thank you ! !","303825":"i worked at a drug store , so yeah .","303826":"well i used to think tumblr was a great app , up until it flagged my blog as sensitive content and wouldn t let me change my icon or header . that has me really angry , actually .","303827":"uh , right now it s cold and windy . otherwise , it s not affordable , taxes are too high , and people drive like assholes .","303828":"not an artificial tan , no .","303829":"i didn t pluck them before taking the photo .","303830":"it s layered , i was just leaning my head down to show how long it is . the front is slightly longer than the back , though .","303831":"i don t have any photos of myself with long hair , haha . this is the longest my hair has been in a long time .","303832":"i don t have anyone blocked .","303833":"good thing i don t live in romania then , lol .","303834":"quite the contrary people can color their hair whatever they want regardless of their age .","303835":"yeah , i think it s entirely possible that there are life forms on other planets in other solar systems that we haven t discovered yet .","303836":"it varies , although lately i ve been having absolutely no self control . it usually happens when i drink , though . i just don t know when to stop .","303837":"i m afraid somewhat of spiders , although it used to be a lot worse in the past . i usually just let my boyfriend take care of them .","303838":"i suppose my eyes are my best physical attribute . it s what i like the most on myself .","303839":"going to work tomorrow , lol . i ve been so burnt out and it s been difficult for me to make it through the day .","303840":"aw , there s always next time . feel better , friend ! !","303841":"no , i don t have a backup .","303842":"lol . that would have been a hell of a lot cheaper than what i actually did .","303843":"i don t do anything , i just wait for it to pass .","303844":"i m not sure . i ve been somewhat congested with a stuffy nose , but that s the extent of my symptoms . it could simply be due to the drastic change in weather .","303845":"my day was fine . i ve just been tired all day i ve basically been laying down ever since i got home from work . i m waiting for my boyfriend to call me back to see if we can see each other tonight .","303846":"thanks for the follow i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","303847":"they did , but they never checked them with respect to me .","303848":"all the time , haha . i ve been so burnt out lately . i m looking forward to next weekend because it s a four day weekend for me i desperately need it .","303849":"they re both painful , and it would be unfair to try to compare them to see which is the harder struggle . hardships aren t a competition .","303850":"i know absolutely nothing about children , so you re better off asking someone who s a parent .","303851":"i don t post those on askfm .","303852":"i would just throw a pack into my bag when no one else was around .","303853":"i never got caught , lol . if i did , i would have been fired . i stole them because they were expensive and i didn t feel like laying the money out for them however , i would only do it every once in a while , not every time i needed a pack . and no , there were no discounts on cigarettes .","303854":"i used to shop lift when i worked in retail . i would steal packs of cigarettes when i worked behind the counter .","303855":"aw , thank you","303856":"most funerals , and when you re getting fired from your job . i can t really think of much else .","303857":"xmas eve ! ! we used to do it xmas morning , but it became too much of a hassle so early in the morning because we would have plans in the afternoon , so now we do it xmas eve night .","303858":"squirrels , birds , rabbits , deer , etc etc . nothing too wild .","303859":"nah , not for xmas . i figured it would generally be a good winter color .","303860":"it s a family tradition , as well as a tradition among my friends . there s really no religious application to the holiday these days .","303861":"i get up this early every day , lol . my alarm is usually set for am every morning for work .","303862":"i answered this question yesterday . i said no .","303863":"i ve overdone red and have no desire to color my hair red again .","303864":"it s going to be dark blue fading down into silver .","303865":"i ve never stalked anyone before have no intentions of doing so .","303866":"i ve never really seen the appeal of them tbh .","303867":"aw , that sounds fun . i ve never been to a buffet before , but sushi is delicious and incredibly versatile .","303868":"welcome back ! ! i ve been good , just working a lot and busy shopping for xmas gifts . nothing substantial has happened in my life besides work related things , which is rather boring .","303869":"oh goodness . i sincerely hope you re trolling you don t actually believe this . or if you do believe this , you don t encounter a friend or loved one who struggle with mental illness because you would certainly not help their situation at all .","303870":"i work better with a routine , but i do wind up riding the wave whenever something happens that breaks up my routine . i ve learned not to think too much into it and try to accept life s challenges as they come .","303871":"i used it once . previously , i used the word deterred . that s literally it , lol .","303872":"i was at work for the majority of the day . i got home from work about minutes ago , and i ve just been checking up on social media on my laptop and drinking coffee ever since . i m probably going to go make myself dinner soon , take a shower , and hop on xbox to play video games with some friends .","303873":"? ? i don t consider my life to be trolled , lol . regardless of what mental illnesses i have , i ve always been successful at what i ve set my mind to , even with the highs and lows of mental illness . it s certainly been a struggle , but not a deterrent .","303874":"that s really difficult to really process because honestly , i don t know how i would feel about that either . depending on the relationship , there sometimes needs to be at least some level of physical attraction however , there are also some people who don t place any value in physical attraction at all and only base their attraction solely on personality . if you re comfortable doing so , i would try to bring it up to him and tell him the truth . see what he says about it .","303875":"i m diagnosed with major depressive disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , panic disorder , and borderline personality disorder .","303876":"i m not arrogant by any means and tbh , i don t know how my boyfriend copes with me because of my mental illnesses , but regardless , he s always been a strong foundation of support , and for that , i m eternally grateful .","303877":"i ve honestly never bought him this many gifts before , and in the past we usually settled on a budget for one another . however , he hasn t told me how many he s bought me or how much he s spent on me , which is a bit concerning . lmao .","303878":"because i wanted to , i suppose . they weren t expensive things at all with the exception of the love book , and i like surprising him with things he likes .","303879":"lol . if you feel the need to randomly spam strangers with this nonsense , then obviously you have deep insecurities that have deterred you from having healthy relationships . i m fine with my current boyfriend , considering we ve been together for multiple years . scurry along now .","303880":"i take buspirone for my anxiety .","303881":"scientifically speaking , medication changes the way hormones and chemicals react in your brain which relate to levels of serotonin , dopamine , etc etc . mood stabilizers target specific molecules , from my understanding , that aid in the stabilization of severe mood swings . it takes weeks for most psychiatric medications to begin working , including mood stabilizers . personally speaking , i m on a mood stabilizer , antidepressant , anti anxiety , and antipsychotic . they all target different symptoms that i experience , so as a result , my moods are significantly less severe , my depressions aren t as low , my anxiety isn t terrible , i rarely experience panic attacks , and my paranoia has diminished greatly . you can t become dependent on medications that aren t narcotics . if you ever want to stop taking them , you can simply wean off of them with the guidance of your doctor and you won t experience any negative side effects .","303882":"hopefully he doesn t check my page and read this , lol . i ve been hesitant to post what i bought for him because i don t know if he reads my answers or not . but i got him a personalized love book , a blueberry scented candle , three more candles that smell of different dessert foods , peppermint and chocolate mint tea , two shirts with bearded dragons on them , a personalized bearded dragon mug , and an achievement hunter sweatshirt .","303883":"copying pasting this from a similar question someone asked me yesterday , since my response is the same don t invest your energy into people who aren t willing to do the same back to you . you can only care for people for so long without needing to preserve your own energy , and it becomes toxic after a while to care so deeply for those whose feelings aren t reciprocated .","303884":"i didn t start listening to music until i was around years old , so most of the bands i listened to at that age are still bands i enjoy now linkin park , korn , story of the year , chevelle , my chemical romance , him , otep , stone temple pilots , alice in chains , etc etc .","303885":"the only things i asked people to buy for me were fallout , a weighted blanket , some makeup from too faced , and coffee .","303886":"lately i ve been replaying fallout . however , i also play destiny , skyrim , assassin s creed , the bioshock series , gta v , speed runners , life is strange , the wolf among us , and tomb raider .","303887":"i m not excited to spend time with my family however , i am excited to watch my boyfriend open his xmas gifts because i love seeing his reaction to what i bought him . i got him a few cute things this year , so i hope he likes them .","303888":"yes , i play video games semi regularly on the xbox one .","303889":"the only plan i have so far is that i need to go to the dollar store and purchase wrapping paper , gift bags , tape , and labels for my xmas gifts . i have literally nothing at my house and it s only one week until xmas . also , i have an appointment on saturday to color my hair ! !","303890":"i would probably buy an all inclusive resort vacation for myself and my boyfriend sometime in the near future , since we both desperately need a week or two off from work .","303891":"get something pertaining to his interests , if you know of any , whether it s a book or memorabilia or perhaps a set of dvds on the subject . or , if all else fails , buy him a gift card so that he can choose something for himself .","303892":"i ve never tried sponge cake before .","303893":"uh , no ? ? you re anonymous and friendship doesn t magically happen upon request . friendship happens naturally over time .","303894":"between cigarettes per day .","303895":"uh . . . how is mistletoe inappropriate ? ? the holiday story behind it is that the two people kiss when they re under mistletoe . that s literally it .","303896":"lol , yes . it s happened a few times to me when i was in high school and college because i would take notes so fast and abbreviate everything , and sometimes i would look back on my notes to re write them and have no idea what it said .","303897":"i ve never seen gucci clothing in person , let alone buy any and wear it . lmao . it s horribly overpriced , from my understanding . i don t see the point in buying big name brands like that when you can get more reliable , comfortable clothing for much cheaper .","303898":"last night , i suppose ? ? i ordered food in , but they were hot wings with french fries . it felt good to have a warm meal .","303899":"sometimes which is why i m always drinking something caffeinated , usually coffee or tea . i can t afford to make any mistakes because i m the final editor , so i always have to be alert and meticulous .","303900":"plenty of times , yeah . i have a tendency to go out on the weekdays because the bar isn t busy at all , which sometimes leads to me having a hangover the next morning .","303901":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303902":"both , depending on the song . some songs have great melodies with mediocre lyrics , while other songs have okay melodies with amazing lyrics . and then there are songs with both wonderful melodies and lyrics .","303903":"it s funny you ask me this today because last night i had a really vivid dream that my boss asked me to send a strongly worded email to a few of my coworkers , asking them to tidy up after themselves because they were making a mess in the office . lmao . mind you , i ve only met my boss on a handful of occasions and we ve never spoken more than like . . . three sentences to each other . so the entire dream is totally unrealistic . lmao .","303904":"i don t think i would quit fully however , i would significantly decrease how often i smoke . in addition , there are native american reservations on long island that sell cartons of cigarettes for , so i would probably wind up making the trip out there for cigarettes instead of buying them at the gas station .","303905":"i haven t done in depth research into which states are more financially affordable than new york , but i ve always thought about moving to either virginia , north carolina , or georgia .","303906":"she came out with a new song two months ago , so i m assuming no .","303907":"i think that depends entirely on the person .","303908":"the cost of rent and housing . living in new york at least in the city or on long island is incredibly expensive you really can t find a one bedroom apartment for less than and houses average about half a million dollars for a regular ranch home .","303909":"lol , sometimes they are especially if you re walking around manhattan . however , if you re in a tough spot , new yorkers can also be extremely helpful and kind to you , such as if you re confused as to which train to take or how to use the subway .","303910":"no , although i ve always wanted to go ! ! it seems so beautiful .","303911":"lol . no , i pretty much switch my mornings on and off between dunkin and starbucks . although dunkin s iced pumpkin macchiatto is amazing .","303912":"is anyone awake ? ? it s am and i woke up out of a sound sleep with a lot of energy , and i have no idea what to do . ask me questions","303913":"i know that there are antioxidants in dark chocolate which is good for you in moderation , but that s the extent of my knowledge about it .","303914":"i really don t remember that far back into my childhood , but on a related note , i was also extremely artistic when i was younger and would draw and color my own pieces so it wouldn t surprise me if i just colored them how i wanted .","303915":"don t invest your energy into people who aren t willing to do the same back to you . you can only care for people for so long without needing to preserve your own energy , and it becomes toxic after a while to care so deeply for those whose feelings aren t reciprocated .","303916":"i ve never been the biggest fan of friends , but the episode where ross and chandler are trying to move the sofa and ross keeps screaming pivot gets me every time .","303917":"the only app where i have a lot of followers is askfm , lol . i would never advertise anything here because that would be annoying af .","303918":"no , i seldom watch disney movies as it is .","303919":"no , my family has never done that before .","303920":"yeah , i wear glasses every day .","303921":"thank you ! ! it s honestly probably the filter instagram had .","303922":"lol","303923":"yeah , i drink pretty much every week or two .","303924":"no , i ve always wanted one though .","303925":"y all , i m watching the innocent man on netflix it s so friggin good ! ! y all should send me questions tonight","303926":"how is that fake sushi ? ? lol . i like sushi , it s one of my favorite foods .","303927":"i m aware . but this is askfm , a place for questions . if you don t have a question , then there s no point in being on my page .","303928":"i think people are good or bad depending upon their intentions . if they have conventionally bad intentions , such as to hurt other people , then i would consider them an overall bad person . however , if your intentions are good at heart and you want to help others even if that help may be misguided then i would still consider you a good person . there are also a lot of gray areas to take into account because life isn t simply black and white , good and bad , etc etc . someone may simultaneously display both good and bad intentions , or they may want to act on their bad thoughts but quell their temptations because it s socially taboo .","303929":"both ! ! i watch it at both halloween and christmas time , it s legit my favorite holiday movie . i ve never enjoyed candy canes , as far as i can remember . i ve never been a fan of hard candy .","303930":"i think people can have haters without being famous if you have a semi large following on social media , you re apt to accrue people who dislike you for whatever reason and try to bring you down regardless of what you do . i ve never personally called them haters myself , but i do have a few people who send me anon hate every once in a while .","303931":"well considering it s only monday and my week has just begun lol , i ll consider last week as part of this as well . saturday was simultaneously my high and low of the week . while i had a lot of fun at the work holiday party and got to finally hang out with my coworkers in a non work setting , i felt absolutely awful when i got home and woke up the next morning with a terrible handover that lasted until like pm . also , today was a highlight because my coworker brought in a whole batch of cookies , so i was able to enjoy a chocolate chip cookie with my coffee this morning .","303932":"coffee , cigarettes , and my boyfriend . every morning , i wake up and have a cup of coffee with a cigarette , and i try to call my boyfriend at least once per day if we re not planning on seeing each other . we don t really text because we re both terrible at texting back , so most of our conversations are either in person or over the phone .","303933":"no , i don t believe i ve ever listened to doom metal before . the closest thing to metal that i ve ever listened to have been bands like otep , in this moment , lacuna coil , him , etc etc .","303934":"last saturday night at my job s holiday party , lmao . i had two shots of tequila and four glasses of wine , and i was absolutely hammered . my boyfriend and i ended up leaving around pm , even though the party didn t actually end until midnight , and i was puking my brains out when i got home .","303935":"i think this whole trend about having a female or gender neutral father christmas is dumb af , tbh . not everything needs to be gender neutral , and i m all for gender neutral toys and clothing and whatnot , but changing a holiday like that sounds so silly .","303936":"no , i wouldn t break up with him . i love my boyfriend for who he is regardless of his gender .","303937":"high heels , lol . i trip over my own feet wearing sneakers as it is , i can t fathom how uncomfortable i would be in heels .","303938":"i ve been fine . my only complaint is that my chest has been hurting me and it hurts to cough , so i don t know if i m getting sick or something . if it worsens , i might have to go to the doctor .","303939":"i ve never visited a skating rink before , actually .","303940":"i don t send links to myself , actually . if i wanted to comment on someone s answer or make a general statement , then i would simply send myself an with my response . there s no reason to pretend to be an anon .","303941":"i don t recall the exact statistics , but you re absolutely correct . also , the diagnostic criteria for bpd includes self destructive behavior as well as svicidal ideation , so that s why people the statistics are so high with bpd in particular .","303942":"i m not too familiar with compulsive lying , but i would venture a guess and say that it s moreso a symptom of an underlying disorder rather than a disorder itself .","303943":"i m highly critical of children being in relationships and i say children with the idea that anyone under the age of is a child . with that in mind , i agree with doe . cc lillehjort","303944":"mental disorders like bpd have an extremely high mortality rate , like i was stating earlier . that risk increases the longer a person goes without treatment due to the shocking prevalence of self destructive behaviors and svicidal ideation . so no , it isn t dramatic . rather , it s realistic . if i didn t get treatment for my mental illnesses , i would have died as well . cc sweetnothings","303945":"yes , mental disorders are considered medical illnesses just like any other medical condition . the only difference between mental disorders and physical disorders is that mental disorders are a combination of chemical imbalances and behavioral traits that arise out of genetics or environmental causes .","303946":"this is going to sound cliche , but love cannot be bought for money . you cannot buy a person s love , and your sh tty behavior cannot be redeemed by showering the person you ve hurt with gifts or anything else with monetary value behind it . in the same vein , you shouldn t feel the need to buy something for someone in order to prove your love . ideally , love itself should be enough and the way you express your love should be enough , especially if you can t afford to give your partner gifts .","303947":"i wholeheartedly agree with you . thankfully i ve never come across that side of tumblr before , but i ve seen dozens of posts about it and which blogs to avoid , etc etc . , and i m really happy that tumblr took this initiative .","303948":"being sxxually abvsive is a different mindset than being physically or verbally abvsive because in the case of sxxual abvse , you re literally attracted to children , and that s something that s incredibly difficult to change if it can even be changed at all . in rare cases , sxxual abvsers may be able to look back on their behavior and realize it was wrong and want to change , but that doesn t change their attraction .","303949":"bpd is one of the most misunderstood personality disorders , although nearly all of them are stigmatized to a degree especially aspd . however , bpd ranges in severity , much like most other mental illnesses and it s also one with the highest mortality rates . idk why it s stigmatized to begin with , probably because those who are diagnosed with bpd or suspected of having bpd are deemed to be manipulative in light of their self destructive tendencies , but it only hurts the survivor even more in the long run .","303950":"i don t think abvse is a competition regardless of whether it s physical , verbal , or sxxual abvse , it s still abvse and deserves punishment through imprisonment . whether or not something is forgivable , that s entirely up to the survivor . there s no right or wrong way for a survivor to learn how to effectively cope with their abvse , and some survivors choose to forgive their abvsers while others don t and that s perfectly okay . every case of abvse is individualized and unique , which is why it s impossible to really say that all abvsers can be forgiven or can be changed .","303951":"anyone have any questions ? ? my inbox is empty i m bored af","303952":"i m from new york i ve never heard of that term before , actually . must be a boston thing . we usually just call it the liquor store , lol .","303953":"lol . i ordered it from a local italian place because they actually have the best soup .","303954":"i don t post pictures of him on askfm .","303955":"lobster bisque soup","303956":"i d definitely go to iceland or alaska they both seem like really fun and interesting places .","303957":"i never iron my clothes , lol . i do most of the washing drying in the household , though . i mainly do my clothing and my mother s clothing , but sometimes i ll also do my father s clothing as well .","303958":"i was using a snapchat filter for my profile picture , so it looks like they made my eyeballs rounder .","303959":"i only eat when i m hungry so the amount of times that i eat varies each day . some days i ll only eat once , while other days it s times .","303960":"interesting . sounds like a classical case of denial and people acting defensively when things don t go their way .","303961":"i literally just said that i don t know what they are . lol .","303962":"i don t know what identity politics are .","303963":"i don t think that this issue is as prevalent as people make it out to be . it s already difficult for people to obtain mental health diagnoses to begin with , so the idea that people are over diagnosed in general just to push a pharmaceutical agenda doesn t make much sense to me at all . i ve had doctors refuse to acknowledge a diagnosis because of the stigma attached to it , so big pharma has never been a factor in my treatment , personally .","303964":"lol , that s an interesting way to put it . i don t know if i ll be on medication for the rest of my life , but i m perfectly content with taking medication at the moment because it s the difference between life and death at this stage of my life .","303965":"whoever is willing to ask questions or read what i have to say i post things on fb , twitter , instagram , and askfm regarding mental health so it s open for a large audience .","303966":"i use social media to educate others about mental health issues and erase stigma associated with more complex disorders , particularly bpd . i ve had a lot of people message me over the past two years saying that i ve either helped them or inspired them to do the same thing .","303967":"my passion for advocating for those with mental illness .","303968":"i answered a similar question earlier this morning , i believe . i don t want botox but idk if i will rule that out in the future or not , depending on what i would need it for . i know it helps with chronic headaches and migraines , so if my headaches get worse then it s something i would consider .","303969":"yeah , i enjoy helping people whenever i have the opportunity to do so .","303970":"depends on who you follow . some people are more active than others , so if you follow a lot of active people , then you ll have a busy feed .","303971":"a small cottage in the woods with a giant fireplace , rustic kitchen and bedrooms , and a big deck in the backyard that overlooks the forest . lots of bay windows to allow natural light into the house too .","303972":"if you want to go that far with it , our taxes do go toward the government , so yeah . however , it s literally impossible to not spend money on anything so this is sorta a pointless thing to bring up .","303973":"i always thought astronomy was interesting , although i don t know anything about it .","303974":"try this one people awkwardly singing happy birthday to you over the phone . it s so cringe worthy imo .","303975":"i agreed with you , if you don t remember . it doesn t make a difference in the long run if one single person boycotts a product . however , it makes me feel better knowing that my money is going toward a good cause .","303976":"i don t have the economic means to move to another state , let alone another country . lol . i can protest the actions of the government while simultaneously living in the united states . just because i was born here doesn t mean i don t deny the atrocities committed by the nation .","303977":"my family isn t interesting at all , lol .","303978":"no , only airsoft and paintball guns .","303979":"because it makes me feel better knowing that my money is going to a good cause as opposed to endorsing a company that is known to be racist or homophobic or whatever . idc about products themselves as long as they get the job done . i honestly usually buy store brand items anyway .","303980":"of course not . lmao .","303981":"i don t support companies who are racist , sexist , homophobic , etc etc . buying their products means that you re endorsing them .","303982":"if i was aware that they were racist and they made no effort to apologize , then no .","303983":"none of my friends hang out with each other so this isn t even an issue for me , lol .","303984":"i don t remember my childhood , so i honestly have no idea .","303985":"i don t believe i did . when i was younger , i either downloaded songs off of limewire or used a youtubetomp converter and downloaded songs onto itunes .","303986":"the only friend i hug is my best friend , and none of my friends and i kiss .","303987":"i m fairly certain that if anyone had the choice between a sponge or a washing machine , they would choose the washing machine .","303988":"yeah , it s extremely easy to use .","303989":"i threw it out .","303990":"no , i got rid of the old makeup items that i never used . it was unnecessarily taking up space , so now the only makeup i own are things i would regularly use when i do my makeup . as for skincare , i don t have many skincare items at all lol . i just own a facial scrub , a tub of mud mask , a moisturizer , and witch hazel .","303991":"very rarely . i ve only had to return things a few times .","303992":"it isn t too much of a hassle unless you don t have adequate means of transportation . usually they give you a return label , and you pack the product in a box and return it to the post office .","303993":"my boyfriend and i have been together so long that when i was puking my brains out into the toilet last night after the party , he was simultaneously rubbing my back and laughing hysterically . i got drunk so quickly though , it was ridiculous . the ceo of my company offered like of us shots , and obviously i couldn t say no because he s the damn ceo , so i ended up taking two shots of tequila on top of having three glasses of wine . i m honestly surprised i m even awake rn .","303994":"i already addressed this in my previous answer that i just posted . i forgot that was years ago , i was thinking that it was back in the s , because my brain is fried . rofl . however , you re definitely correct . there was more awareness of this issue by the turn of the century .","303995":"oh gosh , why did i think it was back in the s ? ? i have no concept of time , rofl . sometimes i forget how old i am .","303996":"if it was something that was happening currently , then yes because that s endangerment of a child especially if they re having s x , then that s also technically considered r pe . but considering that s years ago , like i said , there isn t anything that can be done about it now . you also have to remember that was commonplace back in the day and socially acceptable to a degree , definitely not like it is now .","303997":"yes , i assume that askfm is hella popular in those regions because i m constantly getting likes from people who live there . they re usually really dull answers too , but they end up getting likes on them for some weird reason , rofl .","303998":"i started watching it i think i m maybe five episodes into it so far ? ? i don t remember because it s been a few weeks since i watched it . however , i really enjoy it ! ! from my understanding , it s based on the sabrina comics which are a lot more dark and gruesome than the popular tv series , which is right up my alley .","303999":"i don t make it a habit to pass judgment on other people s relationships that have been established already for many years . it s gross that her father dated her mother when she was and he was , but there s obviously nothing that can be done about that because it s in the past .","304000":"i m somewhat of a mental health advocate in that i strive to erase the stigma attached to an assortment of mental illnesses , so i suppose i do protest in a way against the misconceptions of mental health issues . it s something that i feel really strongly about and try to educate people about it as much as i can .","304001":"i was born around am , from what i remember my mother telling me .","304002":"i usually order a cannoli cake or a rainbow cookie cake for my birthdays . they re the only two cakes i m willing to eat , haha . otherwise , i m not a big fan of cake in general .","304003":"definitely not me , that s for sure . lmaoo . livibates and courrtana are some of the nicest people i ve had the pleasure of speaking to , though ! !","304004":"probably not . i have no reason to get botox .","304005":"yeah , whenever the whole pay it forward thing happens in a drive thru line , i participate . the last time it happened was a few months ago , i was at starbucks and the person in front of me paid for my coffee and sandwich , so i paid for the meal of the person behind me .","304006":"i did ! ! i wouldn t say it was one of my favorite shows , but it was definitely funny .","304007":"brie , pepper jack , sharp cheddar , gouda , and mozzarella .","304008":"yeah , my parents are still married . not really by choice , though . my mother used to talk to me all the time about divorcing my father , but then she got sick and couldn t afford to go through with a divorce .","304009":"i ve been seeing a therapist for a little over two years now .","304010":"i m all for it , tbh . if banning adult content means that there won t be any chance of child p rnography on tumblr , then that s a movement i m percent behind .","304011":"personally , yes . if my therapist psychiatrist were that expensive , then i wouldn t have gone to see them because i don t have that sort of money on hand . that s why i ve always looked around for doctors who take my insurance , my co pays are significantly less expensive than that .","304012":"no thanks , that s an invasion of my privacy .","304013":"i m not straight edge at all , lol . i drink and smoke cigarettes and marijuana . i could probably be straight edge in the future , but it isn t something i want to do rn .","304014":"my neighbor s house , haha .","304015":"thankfully , no . i don t game with other people and most of what i play is single person .","304016":"it s dark out , so i can t see a damn thing . lol .","304017":"i wouldn t force that upon him i know my insecurities stem from the fact that i dislike myself , and he thinks completely differently about me than i do about myself . if he wanted to leave me , then he would have a long time ago .","304018":"he totally can i m not doubting that at all .","304019":"who cares . i doubt you re the same anon who said that , so i m going to stick with what they said .","304020":"this is so sweet you re going to make me cry my makeup off , aw omg . thank you so much","304021":"i ll definitely look it up ! ! thank you","304022":"does the nightmare before christmas count as a holiday movie ? ? lol . if so , that s my favorite .","304023":"i would also like to lose weight and return to the gym . my body is disgusting and i want to actively change that .","304024":"i also know of three within a mile radius of my house , somewhere around there .","304025":"hallelujah by jeff buckley .","304026":"quite poorly i tend to chain smoke and drink in excess .","304027":"no , if anything i wear darker colors , lol .","304028":"i already answered this question from the person who originally asked it .","304029":"hello do you have a question ? ?","304030":"you sending this to multiple people doesn t make you very credible .","304031":"sometimes you have to question your trust for people who are wrong . i was raised in an environment who thought a lot of things that i later realized were wrong when i got older .","304032":"i ll let you know when i figure that out myself .","304033":"i m not racist and i know plenty of other white people who aren t racist . you can t just change your original statement because it doesn t apply anymore , rofl . either way , i still don t know why you re complaining about this to me of all people . go tell someone who s actually racist .","304034":"obviously not . i m in a relationship have no interest in dating anyone else , especially someone who is openly racist and sexist .","304035":"yeah but i m not a girl . rofl .","304036":"that much was clear , lol . but like i said , i don t fit that criteria so idk why you re complaining about this to me .","304037":"idk why you re complaining about this to me i don t fit that criteria . but there are a lot of racist people where i live , so i feel you . anyone who claims that racism doesn t exist anymore is disillusioned .","304038":"take care of yourself first and foremost your happiness doesn t mean less than other people s happiness , and you re deserving of love and compassion just like anyone else in your life . you shouldn t have to put yourself down if it means putting others first because that s toxic and unhealthy .","304039":"my support system my boyfriend , best friend , and my therapist . they ve been there for me when no one else was and have provided me with comfort and understanding at the worst of times , and i m forever grateful for that .","304040":"i don t really understand why someone would lie and compliment another person if they didn t actually mean it . if anything , it s out of pity which is insulting .","304041":"she did , but she deactivated it a little while ago so i don t know her handle .","304042":"coffee and the first cigarette of the day have always been my sole motivation for getting out of bed in the morning .","304043":"i love how detailed and in depth urlsareshittbh s answers are ! !","304044":"i either get over it immediately or i dwell on it for weeks there s really no in between . it depends entirely on what or who upset me , though , as well as my mood at that current moment .","304045":"no , i don t . i can focus on things for a long time , which is helpful for my job because it requires me to be attentive and focused for long periods of time . there s little room for mistakes so i can t afford to have a short attention span .","304046":"no , i never cheated because i didn t want to be thrown out of class or out of school completely . that goes for both high school and college . my education was too important to me to throw it away because of something as useless and unreliable as cheating .","304047":"i used to prefer reading , but these days , i would rather watch the movie . i haven t really been in the mood to sit down with a book and read lately , even though i have dozens of books just waiting for me to crack open their pages .","304048":"when i was in school , i seldom studied it was always easy for me to retain material through listening in class and taking notes , and often i would rewrite my notes when i was on a break or at home to make them more organized , which led to further understanding of the material . i never really completed assignments last minute , though . if there was one thing college taught me , it was to do assignments as soon as possible because you don t know when things would pile up and become overwhelming . it also made me feel a lot better when i got assignments done early .","304049":"i prefer learning in a classroom , although admittedly i ve never taken online classes before so i honestly don t know how i would do with learning at home . i think i would get too distracted at home , though . when i m in a classroom , i m there for the intended purpose and it s easier to get into the mindset of education when you re in that sort of environment .","304050":"my day has been good so far it s not even am , so i haven t done much at all . i woke up at am at my boyfriend s house , went to starbucks on the way home , and i ve been bullsh tting on my laptop on tumblr askfm since then . i m probably going to turn my laptop off and play some fallout soon if i don t get many questions , and then later , i m going to be getting ready to go to a work holiday party tonight .","304051":"oh , awkward .","304052":"that would upset me a lot because it means they re not respecting your feelings . if you told them that something they re doing is hurting you , then ideally they should try their best to stop that behavior out of respect for you . this is really vague though , and it ultimately depends on the specific circumstance . also if she s cognizant of whether or not she s actually doing that behavior . sometimes people aren t aware of their actions and need a hard reality check before they understand the implications of their actions .","304053":"cont myself from that movement , and began looking at people and the world with a more open approach , you were one of the things that made me realize that back then , i really just followed the crowd without any sole reason for my beliefs . today , even though i may disagree with some things you say , i m not . . . uhh , was there supposed to be a third part to this statement ? ? tbh i m confused because you just sent the same thing to mellifluousvixen . so idk if you actually mean this or you just think the same thing regarding the two of us and figured it would be easier to copy paste the message . if you re genuine in this , then thank you so much ! ! that means a lot to me .","304054":"i don t think so , no . i don t really have much in common with his exes .","304055":"i don t have much money to give away , lol . we ll buy things for each other out of courtesy if we re already out , but that s the extent of it . most of the time , he brushes my hand away if we re together and i offer to pay for something .","304056":"i said that i don t know what he s doing with me he has the option of seeing virtually anyone else , but instead he chooses to be with me . totally mind boggling .","304057":"i was extremely svicidal when i was a teenager attempted to take my life a few times . i didn t think i would live long enough to graduate from college , let alone see the age of .","304058":"i don t have one , considering i didn t think i would live this long to begin with , lmao .","304059":"just support them in their endeavors if they express uncertainty about something , remind them of how valuable they are and capable of doing anything they set their mind to , and remind them of their successes in the past . it s difficult to really help people who have low self esteem because the problem comes from within , and it s mostly a solitary journey . people gain self esteem over time with confidence and self actualization , but it helps when you have friends family etc . to support you along the way and recognize your true nature and potential .","304060":"i ve always wanted to take a spontaneous flight out of the airport to a location picked at random and spend a few days wherever i am and experiencing what the location has to offer me . it just seems so alluring and interesting , the unexpectedness of it all . obviously i would have someone with me i wouldn t go alone , though .","304061":"everyone s formula for happiness is different depending on what they like what makes them most comfortable . for me personally , my formula for happiness includes my boyfriend , coffee , video games or a true crime docuseries , cigarettes , and lots of candles and snuggling . any nights where we can light a candle , drink coffee , and play video games together is a fantastic night imo .","304062":"i don t personally believe the moon landing was a hoax , but the conspiracy theories behind why people believe it never happened are really interesting tbh .","304063":"i m terrified of abandonment by my loved ones particularly my boyfriend and close friends . i m afraid they re going to get fed up with me and leave me one day without warning .","304064":"yes , i m waiting on a package from etsy i ordered my boyfriend a shirt that has a bearded dragon on it says proud dragon dad for xmas . it should be here by next week , so i m not worried .","304065":"yeah , they re . and . , respectively .","304066":"i did actually my mother has always told me that she s german irish , but i guess the irish percentage is small compared to everything else i am .","304067":"honestly , not a clue ! ! i ask myself the same question on a regular basis .","304068":"new york .","304069":"actually , he s really attractive to most people too , lol . the amount of times he gets flirted with at work is unreal .","304070":"average height , slim but with toned muscles , sharp jawline and cheekbones , beard and mustache , and short black hair on top . wears glasses .","304071":"no , but diabetes does run in my family .","304072":"he s pretty damn attractive .","304073":"only when i m alone or around my boyfriend , lmao . it s a good way to break up a bout of silence .","304074":"hate is a strong word i wouldn t say that i hate it , but compliments do make me feel rather uncomfortable .","304075":"uh , my first thought was drinking alcohol . lmao . other than that , i always enjoy playing video games .","304076":"if they re in good condition , then i donate them to thrift stores . if they re not in good condition , then i just throw them out .","304077":"once every few months or so . i haven t had a reason to thoroughly clean everything out lately , though , so it s been a while since i ve last thrown out and organized my things .","304078":"ask me questions , friends i m bored will answer nearly anything . except sxxual questions . those will be deleted .","304079":"oh , that s bizarre . perhaps there s a way you can contact them through email from their regular website and give them your order number ? ? i hope everything works out ! !","304080":"no , not that i m aware of lol . my family installed one of those smart door bells with the camera inside of it , though , so if it ever did happen then we would have a clear shot of the person .","304081":"thankfully this hasn t happened to me before . how long has it been since you first contacted them ? ? if they don t get back to you by tomorrow , i would probably call or email them on monday morning .","304082":"that s the cutest story ever , aw","304083":"i m sentimental about certain things , but certainly not all i have no issues throwing away a lot of my possessions , but there are a few things that i would keep because they have sentimental value to me .","304084":"lmao , no . i don t take photos of myself eating .","304085":"i love raccoons . they re seriously some of the most adorable creatures ever . aw , lil trash pandas","304086":"neither , i live in the suburbs .","304087":"sometimes if i do , it s because i m not tired , not because i m celebrating the new year . i don t celebrate new years eve anymore .","304088":"i have a fish ! ! he s a corycat his name is shadow .","304089":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company . i enjoy it a lot , considering its within my the field i went to college for , lol .","304090":"did y all come from lnr s page ? ? you sound like the anon calling her rude earlier . regardless , it wasn t rude . it was a funny observation .","304091":"that sounds absolutely horrid .","304092":"shoulder length is the longest i ll go . after my hair reaches shoulder length , i ll probably trim it to maintain it .","304093":"rofl . that actually made me laugh out loud .","304094":"looks like you re the one on drugs tonight , my dude .","304095":"if i could tell you who i was on any given day , then this question would perhaps be easier to answer . nonetheless , i m a sober person today so there s one minor difference , lmao .","304096":"uh , no . that isn t how hallucinations work .","304097":"only once when i was very sleep deprived when i was a teenager . i don t have hallucinations regularly .","304098":"i don t have synesthesia , so this doesn t pertain to me .","304099":"experiencing depersonalization also known as dissociation isn t a voluntary experience . it s often a side effect of severe trauma and can happen to a person if they become triggered . i experience dissociation often , unfortunately . obviously it isn t a voluntary coping mechanism , but it does happen to me when i m triggered by something in my life , or sometimes for no reason whatsoever .","304100":"no , i ve always been a patient person as far as i m aware . the only times i m impatient are when i m running late to something and believe that i can make it on time if i rush around .","304101":"i get paid hourly too i have a degree in communications , which is the field i m currently employed in . i ve actually never held a salaried job even my last job prior to this one at the law firm was an hourly wage .","304102":"idk if it s technically considered cultural appropriation or not , but my boyfriend and i dressed up as sugar skulls once many years ago the makeup came out amazing . he has this old sombrero from cuba that he ended up wearing , so it pulled the look in perfectly .","304103":"preachhh , girllll . sorta along the same lines , but just because you have a college education doesn t guarantee that you ll get a good job or that all jobs are automatically better than jobs you can get without a degree . going back to my best friend who s a store manager she earns a salary , i don t . she earns more than i do , and she doesn t have a college education . things aren t always cut and dry like society wants you to believe . it s unfortunately drilled into our skulls that we must get a college education or else we won t go far in life , but that couldn t be further from the truth . there are so many different paths a person can take .","304104":"no , i m pretty much guaranteed to be terrible at all sports . i tried skateboarding and snowboarding when i was a teenager it was not a good time .","304105":"i haven t been to the library since high school . the last book i checked out of the library was never returned , so i ve always been terrified to step foot back into that library , lol . i still have the book , believe it or not .","304106":"i agree . as long as you re doing what you need to do to keep afloat in your life and you re happy with what you re doing , then it shouldn t matter what it is within reason , obviously . all jobs are necessary in the long run .","304107":"according to my andme results , i m german , italian , ashkenazi jewish , portuguese , irish , and ukrainian , among other smaller percentages .","304108":"brie , gouda , pepper jack , smoked cheddar , and mozzarella .","304109":"no , not really . i used to drink it in my green tea , but i stopped liking the taste of it .","304110":"honestly , i ll never understand these anons obsession with your life or anyone s life in general . it makes me wonder how horribly insecure they are about their own lives , education , job prospects , families , etc etc . obviously their acting out means something , and it usually stems from the fact that they re unhappy about their own lives so they take that aggression out on other people . at this point , i would have thought they d have given up . it s been literally years , lol .","304111":"i have a fickle relationship with food , so i never binge eat at all if i can t help it . i only eat until i m not hungry anymore in small portions , and i ve been trying to eat less often perhaps times per day . however . . . last night , my boyfriend i binged on a cheese and salami platter , which was hella delicious . lmao .","304112":"lol . this is so true . also , i just realized you don t need a degree to earn a salary if you work in retail , either . i just remembered that my best friend is a store manager of a retail store she gets paid a salary , but she doesn t have a degree at all . it s all about experience .","304113":"lol , not at all . i m absolutely horrid at singing . if i had a good voice , i would have gone into the music industry .","304114":"you can t trust anyone in the media tbh . every news outlet reports their stories with a particular bias , which is why it s hella important to gather your data from multiple sources .","304115":"there s nothing wrong with hourly waged jobs most jobs these days are paid hourly , unless you work for a corporation and have at least a bachelor s degree , but even so , not all corporations pay their employees a salary either . sometimes a salary can be a bad thing , which is the way i ve always rationalized it to myself even though you re guaranteed x amount of dollars per week , that also means that you won t get paid any extra for overtime . if you re paid on an hourly basis , you get paid extra if you go over hours per week .","304116":"legend of zelda , if that counts as old school .","304117":"i don t listen to any podcasts , although sometimes i ll put the rooster teeth podcast on in the background while i m doing something else .","304118":"spanish or russian .","304119":"no , it s something i m fairly used to at this point .","304120":"i d rather live in the mountains . i prefer cold weather over hot weather , and even though i currently live minutes from the beach , i never go there .","304121":"i started to watch it a year or two ago , but the first few episodes were really slow and i couldn t get into it .","304122":"i m all right , just tired . my boyfriend and i stayed up late last night and i m sorta regretting it , rofl . but we haven t seen each other since last week so we needed the quality time together .","304123":"i ve never heard it before i don t feel like looking it up .","304124":"sometimes i think it s a bit terrifying how desensitized society as a whole is to catastrophic events , i . e . war , mass shootings , bomb threats , etc etc . they happen so often these days that when we hear of another mass shooting , we feel upset temporarily , but then we move on because there s nothing we can realistically do . it doesn t shock or halt the nation anymore on an overall scale . the news media reports on it for a few days , and then they re on to the next topic . that includes myself as well . today , there was an email chain sent out to thousands of schools corporations saying that there was a bomb in the building and to pay someone in bitcoin so that it won t detonate . my company didn t receive the email itself , but we did receive a warning from hr saying what it was , and i read it for two minutes , shook my head , and deleted the email . that s a bit scary to me .","304125":"everything that i m angry or upset about is irrational stupid , so ranting about them would just feed into my mindset that they re important issues when they re really not , lmao . i ve been in a fairly good mood these days despite that , so i don t really have anything substantial to rant about . if y all give me a topic , though , i ll gladly voice my opinion","304126":"that s a pessimistic means of looking at birthdays . to most people , celebrating birthdays means that you re celebrating the fact that you survived yet another year of your life and have made progress toward your goals , no matter how big or small they are .","304127":"everyone has different strengths , and it s fundamentally wrong to judge a person based on something that isn t one of their strengths and make an overall judgment on that person because of that one facet of who they are . just because someone isn t good at one specific thing doesn t mean that they re not excellent at other things , and to judge a person wholly on that one area is doing them a disservice . i also relate this to standardized tests standardized testing is an overall means of determining intelligence that only targets specific types of intelligence , and students who don t do well on standardized testing may believe that they re not intelligent , even if their intelligence lies in a completely different area .","304128":"cut the crap basically means that you want the person you re talking to , to stop lying or making excuses own up to the truth . i . e . if someone is lying to you straight to your face when you know the truth of the situation , you can tell them cut the crap as a slangy way of telling them to stop lying .","304129":"i m doing fine . i feel a lot better than i did yesterday yesterday i was home sick with stomach issues and a bad cold . i still have congestion i m sneezing every five minutes , but i don t physically feel terrible anymore . mentally , i ve been a bit anxious lately but i attribute that to the holidays and work . nothing out of the ordinary .","304130":"i used to exercise x per week , but i ve been slacking and haven t been to the gym in months .","304131":"yes , i have seven tattoos scattered randomly across my body , lol . i have them on my left arm , upper back , ribs , and both legs .","304132":"i was at work when you initially sent me this question two hours ago . however , now i m chilling at home on my laptop , listening to music drinking coffee .","304133":"i wish it was saturday , even though i m a bit nervous about saturday night . my job is having a company holiday party and i m anxious about getting there because the venue is about minutes away , and my only option is to take an uber there i ve never taken an uber that far before . but once i get there , i think i ll be fine . it will be nice to see my coworkers in a non professional setting and finally introduce them to my boyfriend .","304134":"well , there are only a few weeks left of the year considering it s december th . however , i m looking forward to giving my boyfriend the xmas gifts i bought him i got quite a few more things in the mail today , and i m so so excited to see what he thinks of them ! !","304135":"parents are responsible for setting a good example for their children and teaching them right vs . wrong from an early age . the way you behave as a parent or adult reflects entirely on your child , and they ll learn from your ways in some form or another . if a child misbehaves , then often it s a reflection of either the way the child was raised or what they witnessed growing up , and that is partially the parents fault . acting out at a very young age is an indication of an unhappy home life . however , when the child gets older , the blame does shift from the parents more onto the individual child i would say teenage years would be around the time that the teenager s actions don t necessarily reflect the way they re raised , although there is still a strong positive correlation between a dysfunctional home life the teenager acting out .","304136":"no , according to bmi that isn t overweight . that s a normal weight for your height .","304137":"i have cold hands pretty much all the time . especially now that it s winter time and absolutely freezing .","304138":"she s rolling her eyes . i mainly posted it because it s an x files gif , haha .","304139":"i ve never watched his show before or really know anything about him

.","304143":"i m laying in bed and watching true crime documentaries on netflix .","304144":"ask me questions , friends . i m sick af and probably shouldn t sleep anymore considering its pm and i just crawled out of bed . entertain me while i try to distract myself","304145":"probably jordan benjamin , the mastermind behind the band grandson . he seems like a hella interesting person to talk to .","304146":"i don t even know anymore . someone who isn t so damn ill , insecure , impulsive , and disappointing .","304147":"i don t know what that is , so no .","304148":"check my phone one last time and sometimes set it to airplane mode , make sure my alarm is set for the morning , and sometimes i drink a cup of water .","304149":"i do , but it s set to private and i only accept people i know .","304150":"i m probably the last person to ask if you want to know gossip , rofl . i don t pay attention to gossip at all .","304151":"yes , with my current boyfriend .","304152":"i must have a twin .","304153":"in terms of school , there was one person whose locker was investigated and he was found to have a hit list , so he was expelled . in regular life , there was a murder svicde on my block so my block was locked off for quite a while and no one could get in or out without questioning .","304154":"the only time i served on a jury , i had a panic attack and they allowed me to leave . i couldn t deal with the case as well as driving to the court , so they excused me .","304155":"a house for me and my boyfriend , a house for my best friend and her husband , new cars for everyone , and i would adopt a lot of animals .","304156":"no , i have no interest in making new friends .","304157":"misgendering someone isn t right regardless of how much you dislike them . if you re going to criticize him , then use his correct pronouns . secondly , he was diagnosed professionally with bpd . there are a hell of a lot of people who fake this disorder , but haydn isn t one of them .","304158":"i don t even know who that is .","304159":"i m seeing my boyfriend his best friend tonight for a few drinks , which i thought was going to be a chill night , and his best friend just texted me , so are we ready to get crazy tonight ? oh ok . lol . looks like it s going to be one of those nights . lmaooo .","304160":"my boyfriend and i are having a date soon to drink peppermint tea all night watch national lampoon s xmas vacation , and i m v excite .","304161":"friendship is a mutual amicable feeling between two people . friends are loyal to one another above all else and aren t afraid to have honest communication , especially when it comes to hard subjects . you feel the most like yourself around them , they comfort you in times of struggle , and they help you become the best version of yourself . based on that description , i only have maybe close friends like that .","304162":"thai vegetarian spring rolls , an assortment of sushi , and fried green tea ice cream

damn week . i ve been a lot better lately , but i used to lose them all the time , and then when i bought a new one , i would somehow find the old one , lmao .","304169":"i ve struggled with mental health issues since i was a teenager , and i previously worked for a law firm where we handled disability cases for clients who were severely mentally ill .","304170":"am i allowed to say all of them ? ? lmao . in all honesty , feliz navidad has always made me really uncomfortable for some reason , i think i have suppressed memories attached to that song or something because it always makes me panic .","304171":"i mostly play solo games actually , as opposed to online multiplayer games . i ve never been a huge fan of big multiplayer games , so i ve always gravitated to games like fallout , the elder scrolls , and bioshock .","304172":"i m doing well . i m currently waiting for my therapy appointment , then i m going home to shower hopefully see my boyfriend when he gets out of work tonight .","304173":"i only take enough that i know i ll eat , even if it s on the lesser side .","304174":"they didn t specify what kind of expenses , so i assumed traveling expenses , not things

i like .","304177":"probably nice people are nice people for the most part , and they don t care about sex or gender and would likely act the same way regardless of someone s gender , i . e . if it was cadence d fianc driving instead of her . i m really glad it worked out well though , i m absolutely terrified of hitting a fancy car on accident , lmao . it s one of my worst fears while driving ,

need to do .","304179":"i don t really know enough about other countries to make that kind of choice . if anything , perhaps australia , but that s basically it .","304180":"i d much prefer a small wedding . i like quaint , little gatherings with not a lot of people more than giant parties .","304181":"yeah , i know someone like that . thankfully they weren t my boss or anything , but they took advantage of their authority and thought they were better than everyone else because they were in a higher position .","304182":"when it comes to adults dating minors , it doesn t take two . the adult should know better than to date a literal child , and the child isn t to blame in those circumstances . that s toxic thinking .","304183":"no , i wouldn t be able to live off of k per year

fact that he dated a minor as an adult , lol . i have no interest in talking to him .","304189":"we discuss what s been happening in my life and how i ve been feeling , and if i m confused about something i ve been experiencing then we talk about triggers that may have happened in the past week that would have brought up an episode . we also have discussed my past trauma and how it influences

too much effort to list everyone out .","304198":"what that anon said was largely inaccurate for a lot of people with mental illness . prior to starting treatment for my mental illnesses , i worked in retail for four years and in a stressful office environment for two years the last year of that , though , i had just begun treatment . i consistently climbed the ranks and was looked upon by my bosses as an excellent worker , and although i may have called out of work due to panic attacks and depression , the work i put in when i was there was twice as much as what most other people did during the workday . everyone is different , but the idea that being mentally ill means you re not a productive member of society is inherently false and toxic .","304199":"idk if i even want kids in the first place , lol . while bpd might be genetic , it s also influenced by environmental factors which change the function of the amygdala and how someone perceives and reacts situations . if i have children in the future , i sure as hell won t raise them in the environment in which i was raised , which should decrease the probability of them developing bpd drastically .","304200":"childhood trauma and a naturally occurring chemical imbalance that has prevented me from producing enough serotonin .","304201":"my mental health isn t special by any means , lmao . i have several mental illnesses that require routine treatment and checkups . it used to be extremely poor in the past , but i m substantially better these days .","304202":"i agree , but sometimes it s also the only option people have . and the thing about ssd ssi is that they re so hard to actually receive unless you have a condition that meets a listing or you have substantial medical evidence , it s such a small percentage of people who actually win their cases .","304203":"possibly , but it s uncertain because even master s degrees are taken less seriously these days . personally speaking , i wouldn t know what to major in anyway . i have so many varying interests that it wouldn t make sense for me to waste money on an education that isn t necessary for me and that i wouldn t know which direction i should take .","304204":"you re exactly right . the timeline to obtain disability benefits can take up to years depending on which circuit you re in . that s assuming you were denied upon the initial application stage and had to wait for a hearing . even so , the supplemental income is so low that its exactly what it sounds like supplemental . often those who receive disability benefits also are on medicare , food stamps , etc etc .","304205":"i m not disabled i m fully capable of working .","304206":"racism is systemic oppression that has plagued communities like the black community for centuries . even if a black person is wealthy , that doesn t mean they can t experience racism .","304207":"that s not true at all . there are millions of people who have mental illness and are able to succeed in a work environment . when i was untreated , i called out of work often . however , since i ve been in treatment and have made progress with my mental health , i rarely call out of work . that doesn t mean my mental illnesses miraculously disappeared , though . i just learned to handle them better with the help of therapy and medication . in addition , the technical definition of disability , in legal terms , is a physical or mental condition that precludes you from sustaining work activity . if someone is disabled due to mental illness , then yeah they won t be able to work . that s when disability benefits come into play .","304208":"it s not a matter of who , it s a matter of people being treated equally regardless of their circumstance or otherwise something about them that they don t control , like their race or sex or gender or orientation or mental physical illness . those who have been oppressed by society in general don t deserve the stigma and violence faced against them . that isn t something a specific person decides , it s just the way things are .","304209":"inequality is bad because it puts people in positions that are undeserving , especially when it comes to those who have already struggled with oppression for centuries . ideally , we all should be treated equally regardless of race , sex , gender , sexual orientation , disability , etc etc .","304210":"? ? ? this is a dumb question , lmao .","304211":"laws legislation , and individual cases of severe violence . i m not going to go into specific cases or examples because it s something you can easily look up on your own .","304212":"i m usually distracting myself from racing impulsive thoughts svicidal ideation .","304213":"yes , it does .","304214":"most of the time , yeah . if i m not distracting myself through seeing my boyfriend or friends , then i m mindlessly scrolling through social media , playing video games , or watching television .","304215":"i don t really know what you mean by those who do it tough .","304216":"i wouldn t be surprised if it was . the rich are getting richer the poor are getting poorer .","304217":"i m certain they actually believe it . all of the racist sexist homophobic transphobic ableist people i ve come across actually believe that people are inferior to them or weaker individuals because they re a different race , sex , sexuality , or gender than them . there are people out there who genuinely believe that those with physical or mental disabilities aren t deserving of equal compassion or understanding .","304218":"i think most areas in general , but like i said , it all depends on your perspective . things like racism , women s rights , lgbt rights , and mental health awareness are shedding more light and becoming better , but at the same time , there is also injustice related to all of them due to various stigmas , systems of oppression , and cases of violence .","304219":"they were likely raised in an environment that was racist and adopted those views around them .","304220":"depends on what kind of inequality you re talking about , and which perspective you look at it from . in some areas , inequality is more prevalent , but in other areas , it s getting better . i . e . racism in america . obviously things are a lot better than they were years ago , but there has still been so much injustice , racism , and inequality the past years that it s impossible to overlook . there s still a hell of a lot of racism in today s society .","304221":"depends on experience what opportunities are presented to you . sometimes it s easy to make money , but you aren t making enough money , which is why a lot of people have jobs .","304222":"you asked me this once before and i told you that cheating on tests is never a good idea , especially in college . you can get thrown out if you plagiarize something in college , they can expel you from school .","304223":"i m pretty content atm ! ! i m drinking tea watching true crime documentaries on netflix .","304224":"i d rather do neither . they both sound awful . anyway , y all should ask me real questions since my inbox is empty","304225":"i would be upset obviously , but there isn t much i could do in that situation . if he wasn t happy with our relationship and there wasn t anything we could do to fix it , then i respect him enough to allow him to do what he needs to do to make himself happy .","304226":"yeah , a few times . i don t remember what they were exactly , but i do know that it has happened .","304227":"break up with him . if you re willing to throw away eight nine years of trust , then there s nothing you can do to regain that trust again . we ve established our relationship too much for such disrespect to happen , and it isn t something i would tolerate at this age .","304228":"one of the few photos i took at the concert last thursday ! ! this was ajr s set they were amazingggg .","304229":"no , i have no interest in making any more friends from askfm . i m happy with the friends i do have on here .","304230":"no , i ve never gone to a fortune teller or a psychic or anything like that before . i would be too afraid of what would be said to me , i m sure my boyfriend s mother would give me an earful , lmao .","304231":"move on . there s nothing you can do if she s interested in someone else .","304232":"surprisingly , no . i ve never been interested in gambling so i ve never had a reason to go .","304233":"yeah , you can get thrown out of casinos if they catch you counting cards .","304234":"haha , no . i ve also never tried before . i m fairly certain my boyfriend is able to do it though .","304235":"i m not going into detail regarding my svicide attempts .","304236":"i don t think it has anything to do with ego . i think people not just women desire to have children because they want a family to call their own and feel love for something that isn t their significant other . that s what i assume , at least . i don t know if i want children or not so that s simply a guess on my end .","304237":"the way you described that could be offensive for some , so you shouldn t refer to svicide in that way anymore just fyi . what initially stopped me was that i failed at completing svicide , to be perfectly honest . i tried twice when i was a teenager . but if my friend wasn t there to talk to me and support me , i would have kept trying until i succeeded .","304238":"occasionally ! ! we have each other on facebook , so we talk every month or so just to catch up on each other s lives .","304239":"she s a woman and she s three years older than me . we actually met on a fan forum dedicated to linkin park , lol .","304240":"i only met one of them in person , and it happened after five years of talking to them on a daily basis . i was visiting colleges , and they happened to live an hour or two away from the college i was visiting . we ended up meeting up for the first time and hanging out for a few hours before i had to go back to the hotel . i was years old at that point .","304241":"the internet . it sounds incredibly lame , but when i was a teenager , the friends i made through the internet saved my life . if it wasn t for them , then i would have probably succeeded in svicide when i was and . they gave me hope and consolation when things were really bad , as well as an outlet to express my feelings when i had nowhere else to turn .","304242":"i have a double sized mattress .","304243":"i think the fastest i ve driven was mph .","304244":"lol , no . i m not sure that they actually work since i ve never tried them before . if i have a headache , then i take ibuprofen . if i m sick like with a cold or the flu , then i take otc medication , or if it s bad enough , then i ll go to the doctor .","304245":"no . i only have one brother and he s much older than me .","304246":"i don t believe so , no . i ve had regular sti std testing , but never hiv aids .","304247":"i m fine . i just got home from work , so i m going to make a cup of coffee and relax for a little while . work today was fun since we had a potluck , and everyone brought in different food items . the only downside was that i got a raging nosebleed in the middle of lunch , lmao .","304248":"i don t regularly send out spam , just every few months when i m hella bored .","304249":"i actually follow him on other social media , and we talk sometimes ! !","304250":"i m sure that happens to some people , sure . for the most part , though , i believe people have the ability to retain their empathy , which partly makes it difficult to live in our society because it s hard to become desensitized to certain things .","304251":"for the most part , yes . i m always willing to learn new things and i like educating myself on various subjects in my spare time , when i have the opportunity to do so .","304252":"oatmeal or yogurt in the mornings , a sandwich with cold cuts or steamed broccoli and grilled chicken for lunch , and dinner could be one of many things . last night , i ate sushi and vegetarian spring rolls for dinner .","304253":"the only person i m comfortable sharing food with is my boyfriend , haha . it angers me if anyone else tries to touch my food .","304254":"meeting my boyfriend for the first time graduating from college .","304255":"i do , but i haven t been there in an awfully long time .","304256":"the person who sells the drug . drug addiction is a mental illness and some people are more susceptible to addiction than others . drug addicts should receive more treatment options , not stigma .","304257":"idk why you care so much about morgan s education level , this has been going on for years . find something else to focus your time and energy on .","304258":"i got a regular minute lunch break , but that was it .","304259":"i would like to get my nose piercing redone , but it isn t a priority or anything .","304260":"am to pm , so hours . when i worked in retail , i ended up working from the time the store opened to the time it closed , which was awful .","304261":"that s a bit extreme . i said i would care from afar that s entirely different from not giving a sh t at all .","304262":"i get two minute breaks and an hour lunch .","304263":"nothing specific happened . it s just what happens when you sit in an office for eight hours per day for years on end . it isn t healthy .","304264":"my back hurts almost every day , but i try to ignore it for the most part .","304265":"i was years old , so probably not .","304266":"i ve written song lyrics , but not an actual song .","304267":"? ? ? i don t follow you , so i won t ask you questions . i seldom ask questions anyway , i m just hella bored .","304268":"i don t really ascribe to any culture at all .","304269":"yeah , definitely . i can usually be found watching netflix , playing video games , or scrolling through social media .","304270":"i don t have memories of my childhood at all . my earliest memories are around the age of years old .","304271":"i have no interest in talking to other people when i m depressed . i prefer to be left alone .","304272":"why did you send this twice ? ? i already care for my mother , but once i move out , i have no intentions of staying around i want to move out of state . if they need help when they get older , then i ll care from afar but i don t have intentions to move back home .","304273":"it usually happens gradually with the coaxing and care of my boyfriend . he s the only person who really knows when i go through depressive episodes because i withdraw from everyone else .","304274":"that only happens to me when i m extremely depressed and can t find the motivation or energy to get out of bed . those days , i stay in bed all day with the door closed , and i end up sleeping for hours .","304275":"not that far at all i m generally really spontaneous and impulsive when it comes to plans i take each day as it comes .","304276":"send me questions y all , my inbox is empty","304277":"no , actually . however , there was one time my boyfriend and his friend were leaning on what is technically considered my neighbor s fence when they were doing yardwork at my house . the fence ended up breaking in one spot because my friend leaned on it too hard , and my neighbor ran outside and started screaming at them , lmao . my neighbor is an extremely grumpy old man so my boyfriend and his friend were like oh shit when it broke . i don t remember if they ended up paying for it to get replaced , though . this happened at least five years ago .","304278":"no , i ve never heard of any real life stories of that happening before actually .","304279":"recover from self harm .","304280":"good thing it isn t your name then ? ? rofl .","304281":". .","304282":"surprisingly , no ! ! he s a good cook and i enjoy the meals he makes .","304283":"i ve never had casual sex before , so i don t personally know . i ve also been in a relationship with the same person for a long time .","304284":"everyone is different . studies show that sex increases the emotional intimacy you feel for a person which can lead to feelings of love for that person . obviously not everyone reacts the same way to sex and a lot of people can compartmentalize sex and love , which makes it easier to have casual sex .","304285":"oh lol . it was a frame from facebook . i didn t type it myself .","304286":"i don t believe i have recently , but it was probably a typo .","304287":"i personally wouldn t get upset over it , but i can t speak on behalf of anyone else . i m sure there are people who think it s a big deal if their partner doesn t like their posts , but that s their own business .","304288":"yeah , that s exactly what i meant when i said that . i think it would be helpful .","304289":"i d fix the reporting blocking system so that anons will actually be blocked and people who shouldn t be on askfm can t return .","304290":"he doesn t usually because he seldom uses social media . he won t use facebook or instagram for days at a time , and he never posts anything . it doesn t bother me at all because i know he doesn t use social media and isn t a fan of it .","304291":"it s been fine . i ve basically spent the past two days doing chores around the house , playing video games , and doing laundry . i didn t have any errands to run besides getting gas for my car last night , and i saw my friend last night for a few hours which was nice .","304292":"only on the weekends , the rest of the days i go to work in the morning .","304293":"when i m not with my boyfriend , pretty much all the time , lol . especially in the mornings when i m drinking my cup of coffee . i think that s why i like waking up early on the weekends , no one is awake so nobody can bother me .","304294":"thanks ! ! you re a bit early , but i ll keep this in mind when i turn .","304295":"no ? ? i literally never do that to actual questions . fyi this is askfm s qotd . it isn t an actual question someone asked me , lol .","304296":"i just took a good ass nap , and now i m drinking coffee listening to music . y all should ask me some questions in the meantime","304297":"no , i don t think i do , rofl . i don t think i use my pinkie fingers or my ring fingers that often .","304298":"yeah , unless i m going through a depressive episode . then i can t find the energy to shower or leave my house at all .","304299":"i m in treatment for my mental illnesses , and i see both a psychiatrist and therapist . i ve been on medication for about two years now , which helps a lot . if you re depressed , then perhaps you should try to talk to a professional about it if you re able to do so . it s currently am where i live .","304300":"what s holding you back from getting a job ? ? if you think that s the best thing for you , you should at least try to put a few applications in and see what happens . i m sorry you re feeling depressed . i m diagnosed with depression so i understand the feeling all too well .","304301":"i don t know if i would necessarily break up with them immediately , but i would definitely have an issue with a relationship if my significant other started using their mental health issues as an excuse to be manipulative , cruel , or vindictive . like i stated in my previous answer , i believe people have the capability to change . but if my significant other doesn t believe that their behavior is wrong , and they re not receptive to conversations regarding the topic , then i may consider breaking up with them . especially if they start being cruel or manipulative towards me .","304302":"i m not entirely sure . for the most part , empathy is an innate trait from my experience , and if someone doesn t experience empathy , they re usually so disconnected from that emotion and usually for such a long time that it seems impossible to develop a sense of empathy . at the same time , however , i also believe people can change if they recognize their behavior or feelings are toxic , problematic , hurtful , etc etc . , and take the necessary steps to resolve their problems and actively work toward being a better person .","304303":"i wish i wasn t mentally ill sometimes . my anxiety prevents me from doing ordinary , daily tasks sometimes , which puts strain on my relationships with my family and friends because sometimes i m too anxious to even leave my house because of my fear of driving . in regards to bpd , my mood swings are exhausting and vary within a matter of minutes to hours , and they re never consistent . they ve gotten remarkably better since i started taking a mood stabilizer , but it still exists to a degree . in addition , i m also extremely sensitive to what people say to me , especially my loved ones , and i automatically assume they hate me if they express even a hint of disappointment or disagreement with me .","304304":"i ve . . . never thought about this before . lol . it s interesting because other planets moons have actual names , but the earth s moon is just called moon . which sounds so ridiculously dumb .","304305":"i m not the biggest fan of xmas , so i don t really have any essential things to do or items to decorate , etc etc . i think the only thing i do consistently every year , though , is buy an ugly xmas sweater , lol . i bought an xmas files xmas sweater this year , so i hope it delivers in time for the sweater contest at my job in a few weeks .","304306":"i just use standard xmas wrapping paper , usually the cheapest paper i can find in the drug store or cent store because wrapping paper is ridiculously expensive . i think this year , though , i might use gift bags for most of my gifts since i can always reuse them next year .","304307":"i don t know anyone who faked their death , no . if they did , then they must have fooled me because as far as i know , everyone i know who has passed has stayed dead , haha .","304308":"i have about percent of my xmas shopping done ! ! i m just waiting for the rest of my gifts to come in the mail since i did primarily online shopping this year . i still have to get my brother another gift , as well as my aunt because i only bought them small things and it doesn t feel like enough .","304309":"i m sorry you went through this , friend . it s difficult when a parent berates you like that because they re supposed to look out for you and advocate for you , not belittle you and alienate you . i ve been in this position many times myself , but it ultimately depends on the situation and the existing relationship you already have with your father . if you re able to sit down with him and tell him that his words were hurtful , then perhaps you should try that and see what he says .","304310":"i don t feel very ambitious . i might do laundry and a bit of cleaning , but those are things that need to get done , not things i necessarily want to do , lol .","304311":"i ve been in love with matt maeson lately ! ! this song is called put it on me https youtu . be hcai g f m","304312":"drunk me doesn t experience anxiety , is confident in who they are , is happy most of the time , and knows how to have a conversation without any doubts or worries . sober me is basically . . . the opposite of that , lol . when i m sober , i tend to get anxious a lot , i m not confident in who i am , i m not happy although sometimes i m pretty content , and sometimes i don t know what to say in social situations .","304313":"probably not . i don t have the time or energy to teach someone english .","304314":"i ve had the same best friend for years , lol .","304315":"no , i ve only been on ssris and snris .","304316":"i ve honestly never tried , rofl . i ve never been pulled over or questioned while i was drunk .","304317":"i prefer using it on the computer , but i usually use it on my phone .","304318":"no , it s just leigh .","304319":"no , not that i m aware of .","304320":"i think it s smart . there are a lot of p dophiles out there and i don t personally think i would post pictures of my kids if i had any .","304321":"you say by two feet . i have their spotify station on . https youtu . be ghylepbkway","304322":"idc . if you want more vodka , then have someone else pick it up for you .","304323":"i m not interested in watching a movie rn . i m listening to music .","304324":"? ? ? drunk driving is a serious matter and i don t know you or your alcohol level rn . if she thinks you re not okay to drive , then don t risk driving . it isn t worth the consequences ."}}
