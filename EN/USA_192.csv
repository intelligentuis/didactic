  I feel I should make a page to tell others that they're never alone and to be able to talk and share how they really feel without being afraid. Especially about teen suicide many young teens do it and it's just so depressing to know they took their lives because they didn't have anyone to talk to and share how you feel. I wanna be there for people I want them to know that they can talk to me and no be afraid. I don't wanna lose any more people. I want them to know I'm here for them. I just wanna be able to help people and let them know that they are never alone. I want them to feel that they can talk to me and I won't be there for them and listen to them. And talk to them. I think it's time for people to know that their is always someone you can talk to. And I will listen and help you. It's honestly just too depressing watching young teens killing themselves. I think it's time for a change. For them to know that they are never alone. We are here for you. I just wanna be able to save someone's life.   And self harming due to being in so much pain. Remember this you're never alone.

  Alex is a very down to earth guy
  
  and he doesn't deserve the sh*t he gets and people turning on him.
  
  He's going through a lot rn so please give him a break and space. And stop trying to enter he's life with negativity.
  
  He's very sweet
  
  chill
  
  has an awesome taste in music
  
  Has a lovely accent tbh
  
  And he knows I'm always here for him
  
  I hope me and him can start talking again. Because we barely talk.
  
  I always try my best to make him stay positive about everything. And he better stay strong because I know he can. He's got this.
  
  so please stop talking sh*t about him honestly people. What is wrong with you all? He's human. He has feelings like you and me. Think about he's feelings too and how that makes him feel. Jesus people. Stop sending him hate and have respect for him. He deserves respect. Also before you hate on him and or talk sh*t about him try talking to him. He's really kind and down to earth. So if I ever see one more person talk sh*t or hate on him I will personally talk to you. Do you not understand he's human too? You guys need to think before you say something. And he's done nothing wrong to anyone so stop saying he has. he's a real one. Okay people? Stop trying to ruin he's happiness. He deserves to be happy. just like everyone. Just because you're down don't you dare try and take someone else's happiness away from them. No one deserves that. Honestly and especially not him. Let him be happy. Come on. He deserves it. Also he should know that I care. Like a lot. And he probably won't see this but hey. 🙏🏻I felt I had to say this because I'm tired of people trying to bring him down and hurt him. What has he done to you? nothing. Yeah that's right. Let him be. and I got ya. only spread positivity people. I'm begging you.

  I really don't understand people today. They act like they're your friends then they turn on you and start talking sh*t why? Where is that gonna get you in life? Please be my guest and tell me. No where? That's right. Yall gotta go on and live your life. I mean after all you only have one life so how about this? You guys go on and move on with your lives and go find something better to do. Be proactive and productive. Go try something new. Just don't waste your time hating on people and or talking sh*t about them. It's stupid and sad. I mean do you really not have a life? You must be so sad you feel it's okay to make someone else upset like that. No it's not. I'm just done with this generation. People act like it's okay just to act like oh yeah we are friends but then go and start sh*t. Don't be fake please I'm begging you. No one likes a fake friend. Grow up and go out and do something for once in your lives. Jesus all I see is hate and people talking sh*t on my feed and making people upset. Is that what life is about? Making other people upset just because you're? No it's really not. I've had enough. Spread love not hate. What has this world turned into? Apparently one that I don't want to live in. We need more love and peace. And also I'm always here for anyone who wants to talk and or needs something. I got you all. Lots of love to the real ones on here 💕 I got you guys don't worry. You'll always have my word. 💯 stay strong for me. Because you know what? Those people or hate and start sh*t are just jealous of who you are. So believe me just ignore them and don't even be friends with them. They're fake friends anyway. Shoutout to the real ones💕💯 I got you. Sending  my love❤️ no but honestly if anyone ever wants someone to cheer them up or even just to listen to them I'm here for all of you. I mean it.

  they talk a lot
  
  Your friends say I'm troublesome
  
  "" don't do it, you'll get hurt""
  
  But, they don't know where I'm coming from
  
  'Cause if I make you the one, I could never love another one
  
  I'm just saying, give it a chance
  
  I don't see what you're running from
  
  Love is pain, love is risk
  
  On the flip side, love is bliss
  
  Honestly, let's go for this
  
  Take a shot, not gonna miss
  
  All started with just a conversation
  
  I hit you up and we talked
  
  Fast forward the crash course
  
  Now we're here, imagine this ( you know)
  
  Love comes for a season or a reason
  
  Something's you gotta know before you leavin'
  
  Know this goes against everythin' you believe in
  
  But, I'm crazy about you, this ain't pretend
  
  Label me as a bad girl
  
  Safe bet, I'm the anti
  
  Chatise, throw dirt on me
  
  That's how it is, don't ask why
  
  But I don't know why cats lie
  
  I would never let that flu
  
  Honestly, I'm not that girl
  
  Now, don't believe everything you hear
  
  All these people wanna interfere
  
  f*ck 'em all, it's our world
  
  Can't let 'em get into here
  
  We could really build something strong
  
  Think where we could be in a year
  
  You've gotta give me a fair chance
  
  Before you tell me were finished here
  
  Already know you've been hurt before
  
  Understand what you're afraid of
  
  talk's cheap, actions speak
  
  Let me show you, I'm demonstrative
  
  We could rewrite the old stories
  
  Let's get it started, let's get creative
  
  'cause I'm the one, honestly, loyalty is what I'm made of....... 💯🙏🏻💯

  something empty's within' em
  
  we say ""yeah!""
  
  with fists flying up in the air
  
  like we're holding onto something

  It's out of my control
  
  flying at the speed of light

  It's hard to let you go
  
  I know what it takes to move on
  
  I know how it feels to lie
  
  All I wanna do
  
  Is trade this life for something new
  
  holding on to what I haven't got
  
  sitting in a empty room
  
  Trying to forget the past
  
  This was never meant to last..
  
  I wish it wasn't so
  
  yeah, yeah
  
  What was left when that fire was gone?
  
  I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
  
  All caught up in the eye of the storm
  
  And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
  
  And I don't even know what kinds of things I said
  
  My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
  
  So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin?
  
  The hardest part of ending is starting again...
  
  All I wanna do
  
  Is trade this life for down thing new
  
  Holding on to what I haven't got...

  my best friend that I meet in kindergarten. And it happened when he was in 6 grade. So it happened 7 years ago. I've never really shared this with anyone. But I walked in and saw him laying there not moving. You know how damn terrified I was? I didn't know what to do. And all that blood I could never forget. It's been 7 years. He was my best friend ever since kindergarten. And I miss him so much. Honestly it's so hard. 😔 there's not one day I don't think about him. this is the first time in sharing this. Never have shared this with anyone. We were the closest. We did everything together. Grew up together as neighbors and always hung out and we told each other secrets and shared our feelings. God I can't 💔 since you wanted to know there you go. He's name was Brandon..
