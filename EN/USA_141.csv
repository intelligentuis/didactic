   what are your thoughts on women who feel that other women owe their bodies to their partner for just being in a relationship with them and it‚Äôs necessary for them to meet their partners needs no matter what they‚Äôre going through in order to keep them faithful? 
-(if this makes sense)-
  ","
  I believe there should be a understanding . Sometimes women don‚Äôt explain things to men and men don‚Äôt explain this to females . But I also, don‚Äôt think that a women should just for about their man & his needs either. Because let‚Äôs be honest if you‚Äôre neglecting your man he‚Äôs gonna look else where as fxcked as that sounds. Same goes for women. Their should be a topic of conversation for whatever is bothering the party & why they‚Äôre not doing what they want them to do.
