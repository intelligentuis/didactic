   Many children like to hold another child's hand and tell people that they're ""boyfriend and girlfriend"". Most children that say they're in a relationship, only hold hands if that and it's usually just a fleeting crush. At what age do you think parents should allow their children to do this?

   23andMe has become very popular. The problem is that these sites can sell your DNA information to health insurance companies and those companies can then reject you from joining them.

  Idk this ones hard. I’d say a criminal that stands out. It’s like do I call the cops & snitch? Does this person know me family etc. if I run or be suspicious will the try me next?

   They're not allowed to drink liquor at 16, that's the point of the law. Wine is very entwined with French culture, therefore legally, they're allowed to drink it at 16. But they've to wait until they're 18 to have liquor.

   what are your thoughts on women who feel that other women owe their bodies to their partner for just being in a relationship with them and it’s necessary for them to meet their partners needs no matter what they’re going through in order to keep them faithful? 
-(if this makes sense)-
  ","
  I believe there should be a understanding . Sometimes women don’t explain things to men and men don’t explain this to females . But I also, don’t think that a women should just for about their man & his needs either. Because let’s be honest if you’re neglecting your man he’s gonna look else where as fxcked as that sounds. Same goes for women. Their should be a topic of conversation for whatever is bothering the party & why they’re not doing what they want them to do.

   With my profits I make I give 10% to Britain First, 10% to the National Front and 10% to the BNP and 40% I take for myself and the final 30% goes to community resources, is that fair in your opinion? I think it is. I give equality to the three parties representing indigenous British rights.

  Lmao that’s so unrealistic it’s crazy.
  
  That’s why people get an abortion before 12 weeks if they don’t want their baby or omg have you ever heard of adoption

   They only breathe without you after birth, so would you get rid of a baby the day before it's due, for example? 🤔

  Lmaoo this doesn’t even make sense .

   she wouldn't even answer that when i sent it to her and started back peddling and contradicting herself when others challenged her so safe to say she's full of shxt and needs to reevaluate her views and regressive, 7th century belief system. that is all 😌
  ","
  fxcking nasty beliefs if you ask me lol .
  
  she’s just ask fxcking gross as those who beliefs it’s okay. i hope to God she don’t have kids .
  
  no telling what’s she’s gonna do . or probably force them to marry @ 12
  "
761679,"
   girls that age have DIED on their wedding night from hemorrhaging due to not being physically mature enough for sxx with their adult partner, there are world organizations and campaigns to eradicate it, and it's considered a human rights violation even in her country but ya sis it's fine you right🙄

  it’s that Islam beliefs over here . like they don’t mind have 2-4 wives of having their child marry someone who’s like fxcking 40. like that person is old enough to be your damn dad . how sick
  "
761680,"
   idk how anyone can even look at a 12 year old, a 6th/7th grader, and envision them married and with a family.. like has she ever even been around children or been that age before?? the adult would be more like a parent, not a spouse. so disgusting. i cannot wrap my head around her horrid beliefs.
  ","
  i can’t either. like it makes me disgusted. lil kids are more vulnerable in that aspect & that’s why men who want to marry children @ that age are known as pedos .
  
  and she’s trynna defend her beliefs and it’s just like HOWWWW!????
