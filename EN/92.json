my mistakes","85505":"i don t mind , thanks for asking . it s hard to describe what it s like in a lot of ways , because some symptoms are so subtle or start off subtle and then intensify so gradually that you accept them as part of your life without thought . in the past , i ve had visual hallucinations that i just wrote off as omens for instance because they just became a part of my every day . i ve at times had delusional lines of thinking , such as the government wants to experiment on my brain or there s a plot to plant a bomb in my home but that s been pretty rare and during times of extreme stress . i was active with symptoms such as these starting at around age , and then went into remission for a little while , then active again , then in remission for years and years , and now i m active again but only to a very small degree . for me now , schizophrenia means my brain fills in silent spaces with it s own noise . i hear radio talk shows or newscasts or weather channel type droning voices . sometimes , my lines of thinking get a little muddled like i ll be thinking about preparing kale for the bird then suddenly be certain she s going to die and it doesn t matter . that
