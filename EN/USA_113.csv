   Why are people still taking out school loans and going to debt for shitty degrees?
  ","
  because society tells them thats what they need to do so they get institutionalized. people need to realize that institutions were never created to help us [1879 Wilhelm Wundt from Leipzig University created the institute experiment and thats why our schooling system changed in the 1900s] He figured out that they can control us with his programs. Banks just want you to get a loan because they make money from that. Schools make money from you just painfully going through school.

  ","
  Well, ive had my suspicions that i am always being watched since i was little kid. I didnt know what was watching me but someone was. Then last year i was getting followed by cops all the time. So i pulled up to my house and two cops pulled up. They gave me the look, “we’re watching you.” And i just knew i had to get inside so i did. THEN recently i find out, its been my BIOLOGICAL dad the whole time. Hes been a 3rd party in my life since i was born and I thought i was invincible but actually he’s just been protecting me. (Im a rebellious child so dont ask but hes saved me multiple times.) lol ?

  Worst part of it is the beginning. Your body feels like its being poisoned so you’re not in a good mental state. You get super emotional and cry sometimes.
  
  After that, the whole experience is amazing. I dont know how but i have the ability to control it really fucking well. Almost like im wearing two lenses and i can switch between reality and tripping whenever i want. So for me its a fantastic experience but for people who can’t control it - it gets really exhausting.

  You’re missing the point. They are probably decriminalizing it. Which makes sense to me. Why are we always so quick to demonize those in pain? They didnt have a safe place to release those emotions so ya they use drugs - should they go to jail for it though? No dude. That would make them more sad, they need help. So its not ridiculous to me at all. Its actually probably gonna save some people lives if you’re so worried about people dying from it...

  I should talk more about my favorite dog ive ever had. I was really young when we got him, 3/4ish. His name was Bear ? he was a Rottweiler that we got from the pound when I was really young. I always use how we got him as a story that everything happens for a reason.
  
  My sister really wanted a dog so she had this big white dog (i don’t remember the breed) picked out but my dad had me come with just in case the dogs weren’t good with kids. The dog she was set on was aggressive towards kids. My sister was so mad. I could tell she was starting to resent my existence. For some reason I just remember looking at Bear and my dad noticed, so he wanted to meet Bear. Bear ended up being the best dog we have ever owned.
  
  Bear was my protector. I have so many memories of him saving my life that nobody knew about until I got way older because I was still hurting from Bears death. My family wasnt watching me most of the time and i liked to be outside. There was a time where i was running through the flowers and a snake slithers by me so i scream and cry. Bear jumped in front of me and threw the snake with his mouth then nudged me to his dog house pushed me inside and guarded it until he saw my nanny. Then he nudged and escorted me back to the house.
  
  He would literally carry me to the house every time i fell. He pretty much never left my side. Damnit im still hurting over him. I miss him. ??

   Should prisoners with full life sentences be given the chance to end their life rather than live out their days locked up?
  ","
  Ok so like the only reason i can think of why this isnt an option is because they make so much money from filling up the prisons. I just don’t understand, they are gonna be locked up for life like just let them die. But people say, “they need to suffer for what they did”
  
  Uhhhh dying seems like a pretty solid punishment for those people with a life sentence.. unless they are also using them to make an example to keep in check. Idk theres so many people on the earth, if someone whos gonna be behind bars wants to die - they should be allowed too.

  It was not a highlight in my life.
  
  & i get reminded by it from my stupid scars everyday. But people keep saying it should be a reminder that you survived. Its just hard to accept that you really dont have any control when you’re about to die. It was probably the most helpless ive ever felt.
  
  I dont talk about it cause it wasnt the first near death experience ive had. My favorite thing my therapist ever said to me was “you have 9 lives.” ? but like i swear i do - well i only have like 6 left.
  
  Anyways, thats why i started studying mushroom species and teas cause my body was going through a tough time.

  ","
  You’re constantly sweating but shivering at the same time. You get really confused all the time. Your organs literally feel like they are collapsing. You can hardly move, think, or breathe.
  
  The worst part is your body is attacking itself so you end up psychologically understanding that you’re dying. So the whole time i was shaking and murmuring “im gonna die, im dying.” So we rushed and ya i was actually dying ? trust me its a feeling where you KNOW

  Always. There was a time when i was about to leave for work, but i saw an old lady outside just walking around looking like she was super lost.

She was shocked i was so willing to help her.

   what are your addictions? or closest thing you can come to one..
  ","
  We are all addicted to something, addiction comes in different shapes and sizes. Being addicted to something just means there’s something you put above everything else, like youd drop everything for whatever it is to an extreme level. Such as; drugs, booze, sex, gambling, work, power, religion, shopping, love, cutting or self-harm, food, cleaning, plastic surgery, lip balm, nicotine, television, porn, gossip, winning everything or being the best, toxic relationships, sports (playing or watching), tattoos, home decor, cars, exercise, money, being right, adrenaline, collecting animals or obsessively collecting anything, too invested in your children, makeup, lying, tanning, fame, people addicted to addicts, stimulation, rage, caffeine, & the internet.
  
  Personally i think im addicted to toxic relationships, tattoos, being right, other addicts, & the internet. Theres other things in there i like to do from time to time but these few i feel like are a little bit more than that ?

  To hate is easier because to love means opening yourself up and accepting the pain.
  
  Majority of people hate themselves, the hardest thing for people to learn is how to love yourself.
  
  Love oneself means learning how to endure pain, struggles, and failures with grace. Love means acceptance. Love is compassion. To be able to love, you have to be open - arms, mind, & heart.
  
  So ya, its way easier to hate.

  Millennials drive me nuts. Life can never be equally fair, it’s literally impossible. Also, by trying to make things equal is actually creating more issues. More extremism.  But its also grey. I believe we all should have an equal opportunity to whatever it is a person wants to be but this idea that we are all special or extraordinary is causing an increase of depression and anxiety cause we all want to be the best. Jordan Peterson explains this better than i do and he has the education for it - if you’re interested in understanding the psychology behind all of it.

   we have more in common than you realize. and i understand that words wont change how you feel. and i understand not wanting to hear other people say what they say.

  ","
  Wait, what?
  
  So i can agree with your ideology and you’re statement but when i say that doesn’t apply to my life considering the fact im studying a bunch about it and here are straight facts. Its about having your body at your natural healthy weight, whatever that is. You cant just discredit my research just because it goes against what you’re trying to say. Also, calling the voice in my head deaf is rude. You’re basically saying that your thoughts and opinions are right and you are gonna voice them regardless of what people say or their own findings.
  
  Actually we dont have anything in common because this came off as pure ignorance.
  
  I think you’re the one misunderstanding because I understood you completely which is why i could tell you about everything i learned. Maybe if you want more people to listen to your voice in your head, try being more compassionate of other minds as well. Much love.

  Ya it can be stressful for others. I understand what you’re saying, I just have body dysphoria. (So like don’t listen to me when i call myself fat seriously. Its something im working on in therapy) Full disclosure i never got to 100 pounds until i was 22 (three years ago) my thyroid was all fucked up, so i got to 115 pounds. (Picture above) then i started eating kelp or sea moss everyday and my body weight leveled out again to its natural weight, which is below 100 pounds. So really honestly, its not my standards but im just going by how my body feels. & if i literally feel like im carrying a water balloon everywhere i go, i gained way to much weight.
  
  Ive also never eat more than my body needs. I have this switch in my brain that goes, “thats enough, youre a lazy fuck” ?

  Example: i had a best friend for 8 years. He put a gun to someones head because of me but he would tell you the one thing i always did was be honest about how i feel.

  If i get called conceited again, i will literally spam you with definitions of someone whos conceited and then give you examples, so then you can read through my answers and you’d discover theres a huge difference between someone whos conceited and someone who knows their SELF WORTH.
  
  I dont think my strengths go above anyone else’s. I dont think my appearance goes above anyone else’s. I have so many flaws and weaknesses. Someone whos conceited is incapable of seeing any sign of weakness in themselves. Someone whos conceited wouldnt be working on themselves as hard as i am, and constantly going through this spiritual awakening period. Someone whos conceited would never be envious of so many others like how i am. Someone whos conceited would NEVER think the guy they have a huge crush on is out of their league.

  My mom is royal Japanese blood from those times. Lol ?
  
  Apparently during the Japanese concentration camps, my moms family got special treatment and its how my moms parents met since they were both royal blood and they were forced to marry each other. I have a great aunt who was forced to get married to one of the brothers but shes actually a lesbian. Just very fascinating.

   Dude I'm glad I don't share the same views on chemo. I always felt like delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol was way better to treat cancer. I know it can freeze cancer cells, but not sure if it can cure the cancer. Still, it'd be better than going through all that stuff that chemo does to you.

  hahhaha you sound like my mom. She said the same thing.
  
  Im growing a mushroom called AB mushroom. They are studying it in japan for cancer research. I didnt believe it until i looked into it for a couple days and I still havent found an article saying the japanese are wrong about these mushrooms because they are anti-cancerous and anti-tumor & on real cancer patients the cancer regressed just from this mushroom diet.

  Oh my god, my doctor is a lot like that too! My doctor is my moms friend though - which is questionable in itself ?
  
  One thing that i can tell everyone for sure that my mom is very adamant about is if (& omg I really hope itll never happen) you ever get cancer DONT EVER GO THROUGH CHEMO. Look into Japans studies for cancer instead anyways my mom told me that the drugs they give cancer patients will most likely increase cancer. Also, chemo is like putting radiation into your fucking body. You’re in Canada so youre all good but anyone in America- seriously my mom worked for oncology for 20 years... my mom said she would rather suffer and die then ever put those drugs in her system...

  Ok, so have you seen those rich kid teen movies where the parents are never around and just had nannies but when the parents were around they were always getting mad instead of being loving cause they have to discipline in a short amount of time before they are off doing god knows what with the world? - ya those were my parents. I was left in a large scary home for months at a time without parents. Even when my parents were around, they weren’t actually around. There were times my dad and i wouldnt see each other for like a week even though we were in the same house. So ya, no affection. Even when i did something really good, it was always “now you can do this better and work on this.” Very tough love type upbringing lol ?

  It’s extremely confused by it cause like its a phobia so like what are people afraid of? You think that LGBTQ community is contagious and like afraid they might catch it? Like they arent hurting anyone they just want to be with whomever they want to be with.. i dont get it, like it makes me wonder if people with homophobia aren’t homophobic about others but they are afraid that deep down they might be apart of the LGBTQ community and they are afraid of whats inside of them... ?

  i am not the best person to ask for motivation because its not really something i think i am particularly good at but when someone needs it, I kinda just tell them what everyone told me growing up - Success doesnt come from being perfect, someone who is successful is someone who fell on there face multiple times and still got up and tried again. Life is filled with trial and errors, not everything is going to work out the way you would like but you can try again a different way. Dont let failures stop you from living, mistakes are the only way for us to learn. if we were all afraid of making mistakes nothing would get done.

  MID$Ohappy, Dopiero niedawno naprawdę cię poznałem, myślę, że ty i ja bylibyśmy niesamowitymi przyjaciółmi. Jesteś naprawdę zabawny, a twoje rapy mnie rozśmieszają. W dobry sposób. Niewiele wiem o Polsce, ale mam wielką nadzieję, że zdobędziesz publiczność. Naprawdę mam nadzieję, że z czasem się poznamy. Mam nadzieję, że Ty również masz wspaniały wieczór.

   Yeah exactly. I mean it helps that I get high during these epiphanies but I truly feel like they would've popped up either way lol. It just feels free. Like I'm not rich right now, but mentally, I feel rich. That's where it all starts. People may think it sounds crazy, but it's true.
  ","
  Omg no thats beyond true. Sometimes you gotta fake it to make it. And ask anyone who was poor growing up how they got wealth theyll say, “i thought like a rich person” you’re making a lot of great connections that ive met older people cant grasp at all.
  "
607654,"
   Dude I've been having all these epiphanies it's insane. And some of them were about money. Cause for so long I looked at money as something evil, but it really isn't. We just need to realize that lots of wealth != bad person. There's a lot of good rich people out there too.
  ","
  Thats what ive been trying to tell people cause like i grew up in a lot of wealth but there good people. Money is just an extension of oneself. If a bad person gets a lot of money they will be an even worse person with money.. if a good person gets money theyll be an even better person with money.
  "
607655,"
   is there REALLY such a thing as good and evil? are those not just terms that we as a society have invented and change the rules of as we see fit? what was good 500 years ago is evil today. who is to say what we think is good will not be deemed evil in the future? its all rubbish imo. just words.

  Well, our biggest thing is just dont hurt other people right? And some people can follow that but some people cant always do that.. so VR isnt real, so they can indulge without actually hurting others. I mean whats the difference between that and other games where you just constantly kill people?
  
  Especially if they used the tesla suit and it got so insane that VR felt so real it was a way for them to release whatever it is they need to get out and then go back into society like they arent fucking psychotic

   What if happiness for someone involves evil?
  ","
  Well how evil are we talking? I believe theres grey areas to everything. I always believe we all have a part to play, good or bad. Also, what is good and bad anyways? Its all based on perspective and ones values. Something you might think is good, someone else might think is bad.

   I've heard of ""ego death"" before, but honestly I'm not 100% sure on the whole topic myself. In a way, you can likely say egos are narcs. Both want to only care about themselves; both want what they want at all times; both are also insufferable to be around. So, there's probably legitimacy to that.
  ","
  I have heard a lot about ""ego death"" as well. Been watching a lot of videos about Psilocybin and they are saying its a great way to have ""ego death"" So, I'm probably gonna try it and see how it goes. (omg i forgot to tell you, I started growing them and OMG they are looking so good)
  
  I have a feeling that theres some connection to the two, i am just not sure yet how it might work.

   With what you've researched so far about autism, do you think there's any kind of probability that people may have autism despite never going to get it diagnosed?
  ","
  Before I started reading more about it, I have always thought that theres people among us that have autism but would never know it. Heres a list of some people everyone would know that has/had autism; Tim Burton, Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Jerry Seinfeld, Mozart, Darwin, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Jefferson ect. I think you get the point lol
  
  I dislike how they teach about autism in the school. Theres three levels of autism. the ones that would never know it, would be the first level. The first level are people who are very independent but they have issues with social situations. They are usually really good at certain things though, so you wouldnt think of them having autism because they become a member of society just by having some sort of exceptional talent.

607759,"
   Do you think we are all born with an ego, or is this developed throughout our years as we begin to experience more of the human life as we know it?
  ","
  According to what I read is an ego is created early on from a childhood trauma. It is the part of the brain that mediates between the conscious mind and subconscious mind. They say that ego can take full control. now my question is, is their a way for you to get rid of your ego if you realize that your ego has taken full control? I also read that egotistical traits get stronger as you get older based on certain experiences. Such as; Disliking other people who are succeeding, not be the center of attention, or constantly comparing themselves to others.
  
  My biggest thing is an ego sounds like textbook narcism. So, is narcism created from our egos or does narcism have a part in peoples egos?

My parents would bring me to meetings and all the other kids would be screaming and begging to go home and i would just sit quietly and listen to the adults talk especially since they think kids arent smart enough to understand anything. I could be really shy at times though and i did prefer to spend time alone. I think i had a little darkness in me as well cause i was mischievous as fuck.

   If the Big Bang created the Universe, what created the Big Bang? Do you think it's possible that our Universe is the product of a black hole in a much older universe and we are living inside the gravitational singularity of that black hole? ?
  ","
  I dont like the theory they teach in school, ive always had problems with it. I was always that person in class that was like “it wasnt God but its not this theory either.” The popular big bang theory is still trying to make us special that it took billions of years for the universe to expand for us to be created. So, i did my own digging on other scientists who disagree with that. I believe that when the sun explodes it destroys the previous universe to start a new one infinite amount of times. When that explosion happens everything gets created. Everything starts over. We would start over whatever we would be. Its a constant cycle of energy. That even means multiple dimensions would also start over. So if we were to do something to destruct that cycle, our universe will never exit again.
  
  Believe whatever you’d like, the truth will come out eventually. The only difference is im ready for it. All of it. Good or bad, probably bad lol.

   do you tend to affiliate better with males or females and why?
  ","
  Ramble Alert: I apologize in advance if i offend anyone.
  
  So, women piss me off. I have had more women hurt me than men. women psychologically fuck you up. They use peoples weaknesses for their own wants. Now, im not saying men havent hurt me, ive been hurt by many but also some of the best people in my life are men. But with females, even the best are even a little petty at times. I can also be way more real with guys because they usually dont take things so personally. idk what it is about females, but they take everything like they are being personally attacked.
  
  no one is probably going to like what im gonna say next..Feminist need to stop fucking things up for the rest of us. Like before women used to be in the background as the mastermind, while the men are the ones that execute everything. now, females want to be the masterminds AND execute it? this whole equal pay thing pisses me off, like why the fuck would i want to work in mines, construction, or hard labor. you realize men get paid more because they are willing to travel for work, work longer hours, and do harder jobs. why do females have to complain about staying home and doing basically nothing all day except arts and crafts with children? like dont take that away from me just because you dont want it. maybe i want to sit on the couch pregnant without having to worry about working. We technically arent all equal. some people are smarter, faster, taller, funnier, artistic, musician, ect.. we all want different things cause we are all different people but we all have a role to play. I just dont want my role to be a female getting fucking drafted into the military. so stop saying we are smarter and stronger than what the men think - we all know its true but thats what made us more powerful.

   how does one go about getting their anoose measured to make sure its not too loose?
  ","
  Well, if the wind blows by and you just hear this humming sound coming from their butt you can make an educated guess they are in fact loose.
  
  Another great way is when someones anoose is so loose they have to tell everyone about it

   Great. I am an atheist myself.?
  ","
  I dont like the term “atheist” because its not that i don’t believe in ANYTHING and its just black hole after. I just believe in more complex not so comforting ideas about what’s really going on. I believe we are just in a consistent cycle of being cattle. Thats why everything we need to help us we can find on earth. Dont believe me? Go study Graham Hancock. Study species of mushrooms, herbs, and roots.
  
  People use religion cause life is suffering so they need hope... me on the other hand i know if they figured out what actually goes on theyd just continuously commit suicide every time they were alive. People always wanna find out the truth cause they think the truth is gonna be positive but life should be proof that it would never be positive.

   Ok I bring in religion and you back out. Shame.
  ","
  Religion isn’t real.
  
  If you burned every Holy Book and every book written about science and completely wiped all our memories. NONE of the same religions would come back but all the science will. People for hundred and thousands of years have ALWAYS needed to believe in something its just human nature... but with literally 100s of different religions none of them are real and nobody would even be able to see the truth even if it was right in front of us. So dont even try to talk about religion with me. Ive studied and visited all types of religious churches, temples, or organizations.. for about 4 years straight. You are all the same. All want the same thing but you’re too close minded to new information cause it doenst fit with your book... life is always changing, if you cant change with it - thats your fault. And i can choose to not have those types in my life. Now thats the real shame. Someone who has a mind but doesnt use it to expand or grow.

   Do you believe in destiny?
  ","
  I believe in the possibility. I have a lot of questions when it comes to destiny.
  
  Is destiny another word for preprogrammed if we are in a simulation?
  
  I have even been pondering predestination myself because i was wondering when a kid is put up for adoption are you taking that kid out of the correct simulator for their destiny and thats why even when you put the kid in a different home they essentially still end up doing exactly what they were supposed to do just in the wrong simulation? Is that why theres such a huge controversy with nature vs nurture?
  
  These are my thoughts. Dun. Dun.

  ","
  Just because someone grew up wealthy doesnt mean them themselves are wealthy. my parents are wealthy, just because they are doesnt mean i am... i cant touch their money unless THEY give it to me. Also, for you to make the assumption that all wealthy parents just funnel money into their kids mouth is ignorant. I have a friend thats a billionaire and her parents dont pay her rent, for her car, for her food.. they dont pay for ANYTHING. wealthy parents have this mindset, ""if you dont learn how to take care of yourself on your own, and learn how to manage your life... why would you all of sudden learn when you have a bunch of money?""
  
  you have to also consider, i was given everything and whenever i needed money i got but i was an idiot with money. now my parents are like ""uhm no, you ruined that privilege."" so yeah i needed help with rent like everyone else because i didnt realize how good i had it when i was younger, so dont judge me for needing help.

   Also on a side note, if you are looking for a good sauce when you order wings, try barbalo. It's a southern thing. You mix 50% regular hot (or medium) with 50% bbq. It's really good. You might have to ask them to do it special since no one out West every knows what barablo is.

   Like I mentioned before, boiling seems weird, but it makes it extra juicy and it literally fall apart with a knife and fork. When you toss in the sauce, it's such a good combo. Add some green onions and it's just that simple. I hope you like it!

  i really wish you could make it for me cause i kinda like watching people who enjoy food cook for others because they get these sparkles in their eyes, especially when they talk about their cooking. its really cute honestly and it just makes me smile cause im like ""you're so proud. awh"" and what makes it worse is when i really like something i cant control myself. im the loudest eating - meaning i literally go, ""OMG.""  ""god this is amazing."" with a bunch of mmmm's and moans. like my friends all laugh cause they say they know when i really like something cause i start making little tiny moans every bite i take LOL. so i kinda like people who enjoy cooking cause that means they enjoy people who love eating.. so it really works out.

  My beliefs are weird. My thoughts probably wont be popular opinion. I think that all religions are right and all of them are wrong. I think they are all shooting for the same end result but i dont think people realize that we arent even able to consciously understand what’s really going on or the truth has been bended so much, the truth wouldnt even look real. My beliefs are closer with Buddhism. I believe that life is a constant balance. I believe that new souls are created and old souls are reincarnated infinitely. I believe that our universe consists of layers of dimensions, you wouldn’t keep reincarnating in the same dimension over and over. I kinda think of it as a recycling of souls. Next life will be light then dark over and over again (ying yang) the universe is energy and in order for life forms to be able to survive the energy has to be constantly restored.

One day she-human asked what should she change her name too and he-human said “Boom.” She-human thought it was funny so decided to do it but then it actually blew up (check out the irony in that one) ? & now it has turned into a alternate reality for the she-human.

  “A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality & lives in a world of illusions by thoughts I mean specifically, chatter in the skull. Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words of reckoning and calculating. I'm not saying that thinking is bad like everything else, It's useful in moderation. A good servant, but a bad master & all so called civilized peoples have increasingly become crazy and self destructive because, through excessive thinking they have lost touch with reality. That's to say, we confuse signs with the real world. This is the beginning of meditation. Most of us would have rather have money than tangible wealth & a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed & to read about it the next day in the newspaper is oddly more fun for us than the original event. This is a disaster, for as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs. We are destroying nature. We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses. Time to wake up. What is reality? Obviously no one can say because it isn't words, it isn't material, that's just an idea..Reality is.. The point cannot be explained in words. I'm not trying to put you down. It's an expression of you as you are. One must live, we need to survive, to go on. We must go on.” ✨

   It only creates more power to a certain degree. If all institutions break down and society gets more and more violent, even they and their holdings won't be spared. For the zeroes in Jeff Bezos' net worth to have practical meaning, the system has to remain operationally functional.

  I think you need a little bit of both to be able handle problem solving. Life is just a series of constant problems that need to solved so intelligent people are able to problem solve quickly and comprehensively.
  
  I believe in balance. I dont believe you should measure someone’s intelligence based on their tests scores but i do believe a good education as your foundation. I also don’t believe that one can learn everything just from the street either though because the streets are dark and all about survival. But I believe you need to be exposed to the world you live in and see it for yourself. Feel it for yourself. You will never learn about the world by just reading textbooks. Knowledge comes from being open-minded in all aspects of life. Knowledge comes from comprehending key words and context clues of our society and taking off the color glasses. Knowledge comes from understanding that you should never stop learning and to never stop learning means never stop growing and expanding the mind.

  Hearsay. No one had any evidence of that. They just assumed she was so distraught about it. But now im thinking what if since she was IN LOVE with him, having his child was like a miracle and the fact she couldnt keep me she fucking loses it because they all told me she was really effected from giving me up. Also they said she was slightly obsessive over me. It would also explain why she ran away freaking out because i look so much like him and i looked like a baby version of him when i was little... like can you imagine how scary that would be?!
  "
608502,"
   You're definitely not insane and you can't completely believe it either, but it's certainly a realistic possibility. Did her sister ever expand on her thing for Dave Mustaine? Like did it seem as though she knew more or was she totally in the dark about why her sister would mention looking for him?

  It came off more as like “i cant keep holding this in anymore” so she like put little hints in her messages that i missed the first time

  But my old best friends mom told me in 7th grade that she was so pissed with my mom that she accidentally said, “im the reason they even had the opportunity to get you, i was the one that picked your mom. I was your social worker.” I didnt know how to respond, i was just like uhhhh okay?... then our parents had to make up this whole elaborate story about how they knew each other from yoga except they didn’t remember that my mom told me shes never did yoga until she was retired (12 years after i was born) oh AND im not allowed to see my old best friend or her family AND im not allowed to speak to her mom ever again..

  ""i dont know, maybe. i've never seen this code before so i dont know."" and i could he didnt really know what to make of any of it. when my dad came to get me, they had a private quiet conversation amongst themselves that i couldnt hear anything they said. after my dad wasnt mad at me anymore, i asked him about why there was a code under my name when they pull up name, and i asked if its cause i was adopted.. all my dad says is ""no, i dont think thats what the code was there for. i believe that code is only for those with certain level of clearance."" no joke, he just left so i wouldnt ask anymore questions and any time i wanna know more he leaves lol.

  Well, isn't this a loaded question. I apologize in advance this is going to probably be very long.
  
  Aliens have been on this planet for billions of years. There are hundreds of different species that are all harvesting different materials for different reasons. Some say that theres species that require metals such as gold. theres other species that require dna. Aliens also have a hand in manipulating our dna. They are saying that they finally have decoded our DNA after 13 years and 93% of our DNA is classified as ""unknown, exterrestrial"" Aliens contact (& have been in contact with government officials for decades) and they give notes with ASCII binary code. They have been warning us to stop sending signals up into space, which is exactly what Bill Gates, Elon Musk, & Stephan Hawking have all been saying. They are saying that we are having an increase in UFO/ET encounters from life from 40,000 years from the future to stop us from making any nuclear bombs. After the bomb in Japan, they have numerous sights of UFOS at different nuclear sights. They communicate telepathically. They come in many different forms. They can be lights, androids, or whatever they want to perceive themselves as. President Eisenhower had 3 meetings with aliens, even Obama states,  'Well, certainly I can tell you that in 1954, President Eisenhower had three encounters, set up meetings with aliens, which took place at certain Air Force bases including Holloman Air Force base in New Mexico.'
  
  Nordic Aliens come from the Pleiades who resemble Nordic-Scandinavians. Blonde hair, blue eyes, fair skin. Nordic aliens are often associated with spiritual growth and love and act as protectors for the experiencers.
  
  Now Lets talk about Rendlesham Forest:
  
  The first of several sightings occurred in the early hours of December 26, 1980 when U.S. military personnel spotted strange lights.  It is one of the few officially documented UFO sightings where witnesses claim to have seen a craft land Nick Pope, who was a Ministry of Defense employee from 1985 to 2006, “This was not some vague ‘lights in the sky’ sighting – the UFO actually landed.”Officer Jim Penniston's witness account, “...No landing gear was apparent, but it seemed like she was on fixed legs. I moved a little closer... I walked around the craft, and finally, I walked right up to the craft. I noticed the fabric of the shell was more like a smooth, opaque, black glass.” The next day, radiation levels recorded at the site of the indentations were also reported to be unusually high. United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt recorded, “It looks like an eye winking at you... Here he comes from the South, he's coming towards us now... Now we're observing what appears to be a beam coming down to the ground. This is unreal.""

  ","
  my dad is a patient attorney - he comes from a long line of scientists, Ames is one of the oldest families in America. (he comes from a serious history of impressive people) he has shares in a lot of things we all use everyday. when i go into the hospital i can point at all the tools they use that he was apart of and thats not even the stuff the research scientists are using as well. I can walk through grocery stores and point at everything he had a hand in. Now our family gets lifetime supplies of all these items that when I was younger I had no idea was because my dad patient a lot of work. My dad has done a lot of work for physicists, biologist, chemists, astrophysicist.. ect. you get the picture.
  
  My mom is an investor - my mom is a little different, but makes sense how they (my dad) ended up together and why they still work together. My mom has always had her hand in multiple businesses. she also comes from a very insane history of Japanese manufacturer and business owners. my grandparents owned apartments, bowling alleys, gentleman clubs, bars, hotels, homes ect. So my mom became a Big Pharma Rep to make a fuckload of money so she can have her hand in all these other businesses. All the people my mom would have me meet were like top inventors or business owners. sometimes government officials as well. I am pretty sure my parents work as a team. My dad patients things while my mom invests into it and then they become major businesses that you and I see everyday.
  
  thats why my parents are wealthy and they really dont care what i do as long as i am happy. they just want me to do anything like i could work in a cafe my whole life, and theyd be like ""good for you savannah! you're doing great! now heres money since you dont make shit."" lol

  Ive noticed when i listen to a podcast, they’ll talk about something and always end up rambling on about bullshit that doesnt matter. People are really good at adding fluff when they talk and ive noticed when i read about something- it stays on topic the whole time.

  Dont worry about what people think of you or about what people try to make you feel. If people want to see you as a good person, they will. If people want to see you as a bad person, absolutely nothing you can do about it. Ironically, the more you show good intentions, the more reason you give for them to knock you down. Keep your head high and be confident in what you do. Be confident in your intentions and keep your eyes ahead instead of wasting time on those who drag you down. You cant change peoples views. You have to believe that true change comes within, not from anyone else. ✨

  You know the British were the ones to name is Soccer ⚽️: Linguistically creative students at the University of Oxford in the 1880s distinguished between the sports of “rugger” (rugby football) and “assoccer” (association football).

However, “soccer” never became much more than a nickname in Great Britain.

   Is there a meaning to life? If so, what is it?
  ","
  The meaning of life differs between person to person. I will say I recently learned yesterday that theres 3 things that are important about life to think about though;
  
  1. How well you LOVE ?
  
  2. How well you LIVE ?
  
  3. How well you LEARN TO LET GO ?
  
  If you think of those 3 things and youre happy with yourself then i think youve figured out the secret to life. ✨

   What causes you stress in your life?
  ","
  Pressure.
  
  I came from a very wealthy lifestyle growing up, but in the process of being around millions and billions of dollars everyday i have discovered that money = pressure.
  
  Everyone is watching you, expecting you to do something AMAZING (which is why wealthy people start using drugs) the expectations people hold for you are so high, its even rare for them to reach it. Ive seen more problems come from the more money people have. People also dont realize how much work it is to maintain that wealth.. theres a reason why the richest people in the world are workaholics. Ive also learned that the difference between rich and wealth is the wealthy have way more stuff. I was always envious of families that were just rich because they had everything and they were happier than my parents..
  
  I just cant do it. I just cant keep up with all the bullshit that comes with wealth. So ive decided to live a simple life until i get my inheritance then ill probably have start giving a fuck but by then ill be established hopefully.
  
  Everyone wants to be wealthy but I promise its fun for a little while and then it wears on you. You cant trust anyone. You learn the darkness that comes from money.

  If you experience issues with eating dairy and grains that’s because of your blood type. O- are very much primarily meat eaters. (Me me me. I was vegetarian for a couple years and omg that fucked my body up but when i ate meat again, my body leveled out.) They have a higher chance of having ulcers (ive had ulcers like twice) they have too much acid production in their stomach so causes heartburn and lots of burping. When i was younger i went to the hospital a lot for my stomach then they saw my blood type and they knew what they needed to give me.
  
  Another thing is thyroid issues. O - have the worst thyroid issues. Your immune system like attacks it which is why kelp is AMAZING for people with O- ( i was gaining a lot of weight. I could tell my body was attacking itself so I started taking kelp and now I finally feel back to normal.)

  Oh hell no ? to many ghostys (as my little niece would say)
  
  I hate them during the day omg i cant even imagine at night. Ive always been really sensitive to the spiritual world (idk if you believe in that) so i can just feel pain pumping through my body when i get close to a cemetery. There was a time when i was little i was with my family and i go “i feel a bunch of different peoples pain all of a sudden.” And my mom goes “thats cause we’re about to drive past a cemetery.”
  
  Omg when i went on a school field trip we went like a famous cemetery and i was looking at gravestones and there was one i touched where i just started crying so hard and the tour guide was mad at first that i touched the gravestone but then she saw who it was and apparently it was some insanely amazing guy who saved so many peoples lives by sacrificing his own and i just remember feeling this strong sense of gratitude and love mixed with pain. So yaaaa i dont like cemeteries

  ","
  I wanna know more about what they say about this, like reasoning.
  
  Growing up my sister would always say “how do you know you dont like something if you dont try it?” And i kinda apply that to every time someone asks me to try something. And i kinda use that same line against anyone whos against trying something new and it works EVERY TIME. And i always say, “you do realize im not forcing you to eat the whole thing and swallow it right? You can take a tiny bite, and if you dont like it spit it out.”
  
  Theres a lot of people who treat trying new foods as like a hostage situation. It also helps to include, “i love it so if you dont like it, more for me.”
  
  I realize i just try to make it feel like its more of their choice rather than im forcing it on them.

  To the TV network, the main difference is in advertising. If you stream a show from a legitimate site, there is still generally some advertising, but it’s usually different kinds of ads than you get on cable TV. TV is mostly build on ad revenue, so it’s important for the TV network to know which method you are using to watch — so that they know which method they need to milk more money from via advertising

   Life is about discovering another universe outside of our universe, so that we can have two universes to enjoy life, and can switch instantenously.
  ","
  Ive been really dissecting this theory ive been having and i swear you’re the one that i can talk to about this. Im kinda gonna just take you through my thought process ?
  
  Ive noticed that they really push ONE purpose or ONE speciality. Pick ONE dream or ONE end goal. But then i started studying the people who are considered the most wise/full of wisdom and they are called polymaths - which is someone who is good at multiple different things. Then i started thinking about how everything im interested in are different aspects of the brain/mind/cognitive; astrology, psychology, sociology, neuroscience, biology, chemistry ect. So then i thought what if i need to study every aspect to be able to get the full understanding of the brain and not just focus on one, maybe i can connect more dots then other people because im taking information from all different categories. Then i started to think what if they make you focus on one thing because in order to fully discover other worlds you need to have a complete understanding so if they make you limit yourself, youll never get there. Cause if you think about peoples careers, they dont keep growing and growing... they hit a stopping point, its the people who do something different that end up learning more and more even about their career before.
  
  Think about musicians. They are pushed to keep making better music of what they are specialized in and a lot of times if they try to do something different the music industry kinda loses their shit.. they hit a stopping point too and thats why people like eminem went to do different things cause theres only a limit you can go with one thing...
  
  Omg i got off topic. My point is, i think if we keep being open minded to all aspects of life and learn about all of it, we will probably be more connected with earth

  Dont stress the little things. Have as much fun as possible. You’re not going to be able to connect the dots you need to find to be able to find yourself until your brain is done developing, so please stop being so hard on yourself. No need to keep beating yourself up, your growing and your learning!! Take this time to cherish those in your life because when you get older whether you like it or not, you will out grow some and some will out grow you so enjoy the time you have with them. Life takes you on crazy paths and you will have some crazy chapters but just enjoy it. Life is too short to be so sad all the time. Dont worry so much about the future. Worry about the present because if you dont, you might not even have a future. Pay attention to your health and your mind. Take your time to heal and let go. ?

  • I believe we are a species with amnesia, I think we have forgotten our roots and our origins. I think we are quite lost in many ways. And we live in a society that invests huge amounts of money and vast quantities of energy in ensuring that we all stay lost. A society that invests in creating unconsciousness, which invests in keeping people asleep so that we are just passive consumers or products and not really asking any of the questions.
  
  • You have to understand that we've had more than 40 years now of massively financed propaganda called the 'War on Drugs'.
  
  • This beautiful Earth that we have, this gift that the Universe has given us is precious beyond measure, precious beyond imagination, and we are part of it and we must treat it with Love, respect, and reverence.

   Different people and different organisms perceive reality in vastly different ways. With that in mind, what is real and what is just our perception of reality? 

Or does every organism live in its own personal reality?
  ","
  There’s so many different ideas that people believe might be going on. We all perceive a different reality.. that might be because we all looking into a mirror or we are in a simulation together. Its quite possible that theres realms within realms and we cant even tell, which would make some people perceptions vastly different. Theres also a theory of multiverse and alternate realities. Which means it’s possible that you could have 100 different realities.
  
  I pretty much cant even come close to an idea of what we all perceive and why.

   Could you be happy in a polyamorous relationship?
  ","
  So there was a time where i was getting lost in the rabbit hole of YouTube and i was watching real stories and one of them was about a polyamorous relationship. I was fascinated. They broke it down where they have a different relationship with a different person based their personality.
  
  Example: if Jenna* is married to Jeff* - they have a wild fun relationship. But Jenna* likes to be a homebody sometimes but Jeff* doesn’t, but that doesnt mean they still dont love each other. Jenna* found Steve* as someone she can snuggle by the fire with cause hes an introvert and enjoys a good book instead. Jeff* would meet Stella* who be young and wild.
  
  So all their needs would be equally met and then they could have a healthy relationship with each other.
  
  In my own personal life ive experienced this working really well in my group of friends. I was good at keeping the relationships cause i knew each strength of my friends and i would always be their partner in crime which made all the relationships in general healthier because they started doing the same amongst each other so why couldnt romantic relationships be the same?
  
  I dont like sharing people though. I like being the center of attention.. so I probably would get really jealous. :(
  "
609507,"
   Have you ever lost any respect for someone instantly?
  ","
  Omg yes. People lose my respect faster than i realize they lost my respect... respect is a HUGE deal to me. Once you disrespect me I subconsciously start detaching myself from people which ends up ugly and then i always have to come back and apologize that its my fault for not talking to them about it and just getting petty. So now im trying to talk to people who disrespect me and just tell them how i feel and work through it.
  "
609508,"
   I will always regret my decisions. Time to time it still crosses my mind. You don’t have to hear me out or even accept my apology but I needed to say this.

609514,"
   What makes you think we can do all that? Although there are exceptions like you, most people seem to be entrenched in making the status quo even worse. I feel like we're on a collision course for just f'ing everything up til there's nothing left.
  ","
  I feel like if we all just tripped on Ayahuasca worldwide, i feel like we all connect in ways that’s unimaginable. Think about it. The controlling government isn’t against mind altering drugs, think of big pharmaceuticals that make billions are passing out mind altering drugs. Alcohol is a mind altering drug. They are against the ones that are reported by thousands of years of records of civilizations using these natural items from the earth to unify themselves.

  ","
  I don't see any virtue in nationalism it is an accident of birth which nation you were born it it was nothing that you did for your own Merit you didn't earn that you were born by accident in a particular Nation why should we automatically feel the other people who were born by accident in that particular nation has something special in common with us and that we together are a group who are much more important than other groups of people?  this does not mean I'm in favor of world government I detest government's that's another thing we need to grow out of we don't need governments anymore if we have them they should have a very minimal role in our society I think it's possible for the human race to relate as one family without leaders and governments who are exploiting the worst aspects of our character the lowest common denominator of our society deliberately encouraging fears and hatreds and suspicioned what responsible leaders should be doing is encouraging love and unity and failure to do that in my view disqualifies them from the leadership role entirely.

  Because thats how this shit goes. A virus will be foreign to us and we will lose people but other people have to survive and create antibodies and to build immunity. If you look back in history whenever something like this happened there were always someone capable of building immunity to passing it on. (The antibodies your parents have, you will end up getting. During pregnancy a mans sperm is filled with antibodies and its actually good for the kid. The womens breast milk is also filled with antibodies. Milky substance = antibodies ?)

   The beauty about infinite realities is that we can always shift to another reality. The physical world is mostly the same, but mentally we know we shifted. It's like you set the intention to shift, you fully believe it, you open your eyes, and you dont question if you shifted or not.

  "
609929,"
   Then do it.
  ","
  Bro, have you been even reading the thread. I posted multiple times they dont even have all serial killers documented whatsoever. Its extremely difficult. HOW CAN YOU MAKE A THEORY WHEN YOU ARENT EVEN ABLE TO CALCULATE THE CORRECT NUMBERS? If not all serial killers are documented throughout the last few hundred of years how can you even think you can make an educated guess? Also, who the fuck are you? Are you some psychologist with a PHD studying the brain at Harvard, who are you to make a definitive argument like this and not even be able to give me more than ONE example other than mass shootings?
  "
609930,"
   Women are not more likely to off people they're close to than men. Look at the domestic violence related fatality numbers. They're overwhelmingly men caused. But because some random psychologist says ones committed by women are underreported, you've wildly misinterpreted its implications.
  ","
  Hahahhahahhahahahhaha
  
  72% killed at least one person in their care, and nearly half of them have killed their children.

  Your argument is very easily debunked
  "
609934,"
   The point is the same; men are more likely to kiIi
  ","
  No thats not the point at all ?
  
  Women are more likely to poison you
  
  Men are more likely to mass shoot up a school.
  
  Women are more likely to kill you in the hospital they are called “angel killers”
  
  Men are more likely to stalk you.
  
  Women are more likely to kill someone they get close too.
  
  Men are more likely to kill a stranger.
  
  From a psychologist who study serial killers literally said exactly what i said.
  "
609935,"
   Oh I believe you. I'm not trying to act like all women are angels. There are all kinds of evil ones, but the example I'm giving, which is the easiest way to inflict the most damage, is something women don't do even a fraction as often as men. There has to be some kind of reason behind that.
  ","
  Your example isnt a serial killer.
  
  Your example is a ONE time planned event.
  
  Serial killers are CLEARLY separate murders at different times. Dude its in the fucking name “serial” - “series”
  
  Your argument should be women do not commit mass shootings.
  "
609936,"
   It is the same to an extent: murdering
  ","
  No, you asked about serial killers.
  
  Serial killers is one of the different types of murders.
  
  They are not all the same. Some are more heinous that they get classified as serial.
  "
609937,"
   So you think women are more evil than men?
  ","
  I know women are more fucked up and crazy than men. Women are patient. They crawl inside your brain and twist shit around.
  "
609938,"
   And also, most of those awful mass casualty situations were not patternless or random at all. The person, usually a late teen to 20 something man,  often has some sort of agenda that they've outlined and chose where they'd do it pretty carefully. Women almost never do this.
  ","
  I think people dont give women enough credit. I dont think people believe women are smart but actually they just manipulated men into believing their not smart so the man thinks the women are too stupid to work so the women gets to stay home all day and just wait for the husband to leave to do her real agenda.
  
  Have you studied about the teen girls that kill their students by luring into woods ect. Its tragic. If you take the time to study youd see theres a fuck ton of fucked up but brilliant females. You wouldnt believe me but some of the notorious serial killers are women. I own a book called “serial killer files” it has a pretty equal amount of genders
  "
609939,"
   Sure but what you’re saying doesn’t hold if we take into account that with modern technology we’re able to tell if someone’s was poisoned. Even then, there are still more men who are like that than women
  ","
  Yeah maybe if the body died recently and was kept well but not in the 1800s and before... how the fuck would you be able go get a good record of all those people who were being murdered left and right since there was no modern technology.
  
  Also, women are snakes. If you go read about women serial killers today - they are more terrifying than the men. At least the men will just cut your hand off in your face but women will manipulate you. Have you not paid attention to the women that somehow always has a rich old husband that keeps dying?
  "
609940,"
   How about all the crazy active shooter situations? Almost all of them are men. Seems like a strong correlation.
  ","
  Those arent categorized as serial killers. Those are mass murders, manslaughter.
  
  A serial killer is someone that systematically is killing individual victims with a pattern and/or motive. Its more sinister, dark, wicked.
  
  Mass murder/Manslaughter is someone that kills one or  multiple people at one time with no pattern or system - just a random selection of victims. Thats why car accidents that have casualties are manslaughter because its random and not planned.
  "
609941,"
   Has anyone called you Charlie Boomket yet?
  ","
  No that is a new one!! ?
  "
609942,"
   Why do you think is it that most serixI kiIIxrs are men?
  ","
  I would say that most are men, i just over time in history men were the ones more likely to get caught because women had be a little bit more sneaky to kill.. theres been so many women who poisoned tons of people but never got caught cause in the time nobody figured it out yet. And i would say that most people vision men to be more animalistic cause they hunt and they are bigger/stronger. People dont realize that over time women have manipulated those men into doing awful things for them. So you cant really make it so black and white when we dont even have a proper record of all the people killing people
  "
609943,"
   You wouldn't. It was a trick question which you handled perfectly. This was like when Willy Wonka went off on Charlie at the end to see how he'd react. Charlie gave back the gobstopper instead of selling it to who he thought was Slugworth. Like Charlie, you passed the test of character.

  Well when i was in kindergarten my brothers best friend let me come over with my brother and this family in 2000-2001 was making about 32 million a year.
  
  Then my best friend for many years, her father made 78 million a year around 2007-2009. So you can imagine how much they probably make now cause they still make a lot of money today.
  
  - i dont think its really fair that they make THIS much money. Like if they just took 10 million and gave 100,000 to 100 people that could help out our economy so much... ive seen stupid wealth and luckily the families i know give back a lot but theres a lot of people that should help but dont.

   If we've never glitched, we're probably the ones who are more intellectually advanced than our other humans who have glitched. Maybe we're the aliens.
  ","
  That would make a lot of sense because my whole life people would tell me how they remember certain things and i always have to correct them and i can give like small details about everything too. People make the excuse we all perceive things differently but what if we just say that cause we don’t understand that our simulation was just glitching? Or i have a couple friends that literally go off into space so intensely it looks like they leave their body.. what if the simulation is paused and thats why that happens?
  "
610023,"
   The Mandela Effect can be seen as a glitch in simulation as well. We probably already knew this, but given how many people have misremembered things, it makes me wonder if these glitches are intentional or not. Maybe it's just software going bad, or maybe it's to tell us that we live in a simulation
  ","
  Whoa and what does it mean if your a person that never had a glitch like that and managed to go their whole lives remembering exactly how things went?

   John Lennon probably saw the future. He knew that he was so damn smart that if he were to die at any moment, he'd ascend into the best reality ever, because he was already psychologically there through his music he wrote, and the words he used.

  Thats a really good point. Maybe he really was so smart to see what’s really going on!
  "
610025,"
   That's the kind of heaven that I like. A heaven that's basically just living in a world that's got everything you ever wanted. No violence, no war, no hate, nothing. It's just peace the whole time. Maybe that's where John Lennon is.
  ","
  Maybe john lennon knew thats where he was headed? Maybe thats why people commit suicide? Those thoughts in their head that tell them that this life is meaningless and sad because they somehow have knowledge without realizing it about the world that comes after and they cant wait any longer or maybe they got a message for the supervisors saying, “its time, you can come home now.”
  "
610026,"
   That would explain why amnesia is a thing. The old soul left the body to go into someone elses soul in another reality, and the new soul entered the old body. Except, the new soul can't function properly because it doesn't know what to do. So it forgets everything.
  ","
  Well it’s essentially why they would want you to start as a baby cause whenever someone comes out of a coma what is it like for them? Its like they turned into an adult baby.. but the hosts didnt have 20 years to wait... they need to start in a year or so..
  
  and thats why theres so many stories of people in comas waking up with talents they never had before, talking about people theyve never met, and have memories that arent even theres!
  
  Omg wait, this is kinda making sense.
  "
610027,"
   why ,to punch people ?
  ","
  No to look so sexy ?
  "
610028,"
   Honestly I just chose three times as a random number lol. It could end up being only once, or 5 million times. We may never truly know.
  ","
  Lets say its three times and the clue to know whether your in the first or second simulation before the 3rd is the first you go into it knowing nothing, unable to see whats right in front of them cause they have to learn so much then the 2nd simulation you know a bit more, you’re more open minded and see the world for what it is because you took all you learned from the first time without even knowing it. Then the 3rd is what people call heaven but its not actually heaven its here on earth but in a different dimension in a different simulation the best simulation..
  "
610029,"
   And yes I love to cause your brain to go into overdrive. I did that purposely. Oops :P. But also, what if when we die, we don't die, but just go into the body of someone who wakes up from a coma?
  ","
  What if people who go into comas because they get pulled out of the matrix but they leave the body able to have a new host unless the body is too damaged and they just take it out completely? But what if the ones that wake up are never who they were when they fell into a coma? What if its the fastest way to switch host without going through the whole birthing process?
  
  Stop it spencccyyy my brain might explode with all these ideas. Lol ?
  "
610030,"
   I mean that's the thing. Right now, we live in a simulation. When we die, we don't truly die, we just end up being in someone elses body. It's like we transitioned bodies but have the same soul. So now we're in the 2nd simulation. Then we die again, and truly discover the ultimate simulation.
  ","
  Ohhhhhh... now im getting it.
  
  Why do you think it must be three times? Why couldnt it be infinite until you deliver whatever your destiny is preprogrammed for you in the matrix and you have to keep going into its done correctly?
  "
610031,"
   That's also one reason why I don't send out questions unless I do it randomly lol. I'd rip my head off reading some of those answers, especially if it was a deep one. Like if The Matrix has another Matrix, and we have to die twice in order to reach the true simulation that we're living in.
  ","
  The amount of one worded answers is just a disappointment.
  
  I had to read that over 3 times to fully grasp what you are saying and i still think that concept is so obscure that my brain is like buffering ?
  
  How would the true simulation being different than the matrix inside the matrix? What about dying twice makes it where you’re able to go to where we’re living in? And why is it where we’re living is the special place, what if we are just in our first matrix? Are you able to tell in the matrix that you are in the matrix, are their any clues?
  
  Look what you did to my brain, are you proud? ?

   I think the main problem with your example (there are others) is that it doesn't account for second-order effects. As an example, the N@zi mindset was exactly the same as your own -- do heinous things for the sake of the ""greater good"". Note how that turned out.

  When i was in 2nd or 3rd grade my school had us do an exercise to see what type of people we were. “If theres 12 people on the train track tied down with a train coming, you can save 6 of them and yourself but lose the rest or you can save all of them but you wouldnt make it. What do you do?” Wanna know what my teachers predicted I would be? A leader or hero of some sort. Because at 7 years old i was willing to sacrifice myself like I understood wtf that meant lol but i just remember everyone else chose the other one and thought i was weird anyways....
  
  You gotta sacrifice in anything you want to achieve greatness in. If you’re not willing to sacrifice for the better of yourself or humankind then whats the point? If there was a disease that was so deadly in a little village in Africa, so we went over there and studied it and used the people to test vaccines ect is it wrong that maybe 200 were killed in that process but millions were saved or do we just sit there knowing that theres people dying faster than water drys up in the sun but it’s unethical so we cant do anything yet?

   I just had an idea: what if everyone on this planet was simulated to do certain things, at certain places, at certain times, and while we might be able to control our future, it's actually all pre-determined, and our ""control"" is just the simulation telling us what to do?
  ","
  Oh my god, bro yesterday I actually made this point to someone. Im not sure if you saw it.
  
  What if our idea of whats good and bad was just created from our own freewill? What if things went differently bad things were good and good things were bad? So what if we are preprogrammed as a simulation and it’s called alternative realities because they preprogrammed different outcomes to different worlds because of different realities and freewill? What if some are supposed to commit suicide, kill people, eat people, steal, and just awful things? We dont know why yet, but what if all of it doesn’t actually have a reason that we would all agree and like? What if they preprogrammed this world with such fuckery to see how we would react and quite possibly in another universe you could possibly be way worse or way better? Its a see what happens ??‍♀️ kinda superiority honestly. I dont think they control everything we do but i do think that based on the personality they give you, they want to see what choices we make. Thats where this idea of freewill comes from, its the illusion.

  Why did I just find this so funny? I usually find humor is things that are funny cause its true! ? i just love how at the end you go “slowly destroying the earth” like i was all for it until the end and then i got all sad :( i wanna be good.
  
  Ok just for my enjoyment lets say this is true. So like ive been having this battle because ive been feeling like deep down im like a dark diabolical person but ive been constructed to be a better person so like im fighting against this nature to not study the brain to complete genocide to save the planet. What if im supposed to slowly destroy humans but because i have so much empathy i cant? God i would be such a weak alien ?

  We have the same mindset.
  
  I had to drive someone to the dmv but cause of covid they weren’t letting more people in so my friend got all pissed and i was like “look around you, were in Tahoe and we just had an awesome conversation on the drive down here and we can grab lunch and enjoy a new place.”

   Funny you mention that cause I find it very akin to being high. When you're high, you feel like you're on top of the world. When you're not, sometimes it feels like the whole world is crashing before your eyes. Kind of like those confidence waves you get when you're not high.
  ","
  You’re right it’s extremely similar! Well honestly smoking weed just kinda enhances euphoria in your brain for you and so you feel like your crashing when you start to lose the high. Thats why its always good to fall asleep high so when you wake up youre all refreshed!
  "
610409,"
   I suspect some won't view what's behind the wall as a menacing place, but rather a secret garden to till with you. That's not to downplay the turmoil you go through when you're there, but just in terms of believing that any place that shaped your beautiful self had the potential to be beautiful too.
  ","
  Wow. Something in my childhood has put a block on seeing life in the way that you do. You see life with such colors and light. Because of that you see the beauty behind everything.

   That imagery was very helpful in understanding how you feel in those situations. So do you prefer when people give you your space during those times or do you sort of hope that someone is able to walk through that wall and comfort you?

  I only want someone i trust to really try to get through that wall but at the same time how do you know you cant trust someone else if their trying to get through the wall cause maybe they actually care?

   How do you handle fear? Are you good at facing down the things that scare you or do you try to avoid them?
  ","
  Im a big believer in facing my fears. Ever since i learned that when they help those with phobias they do increments of them facing their fears (example: phobia of heights they would take them a certain height at a time.) ive just told myself I just gotta do it. When i face my fears i gotta do it with someone i trust though. Ill always say, “im really afraid or im scared to death but if youll do it with me i guess.”
  
  • first time riding a bike i was so scared, my brother had me go down a steep hill my first time. I fell into bushes but kept riding ever since.
  
  • first time swimming in a pool i was scared of water, my brother threw me in the deep end and i swam everyday after that
  
  • first time in the ocean i was terrified of the waves, my friend made me run into a wave with her and kept going.
  
  • i was scared of opening up my mind to the pain, but i found a therapist that i actually trust. And now ive been diving deeper than i think i like lol
  
  • i had this fear of change, my cousin was next to me through the whole process of moving and starting over. Because of her i keep going headstrong.

  Well, ill add some imagery here. When my mind goes dark its like my brain shuts the door and turns off its speaker then it turns on autopilot as i emotionlessly start grabbing bricks and start building the imaginary wall. Every time someone asks me whats wrong i go .5x faster to get the wall fixed so my brain will crack open the door slightly and the speaker on low since it feels safe again.
  
  Which means i sit in silence. I just sit in my pain until i make sure nobody can hurt me again. My mind is fucking hamster wheel and when it gets overwhelmed it just goes straight survival mode.

  Or we are in a simulation and we technically never die because we technically never alive.

  i have been feeling like hes been kinda lying about some of his relationships to kinda make me jealous or to see my reaction. like i think he makes up scenarios with a girl to hear what i would say about it and see if he really does like me cause now all of a sudden their like ""im gonna be single until the right one is ready to be in my life."" ohhhhh and then they also said ""i tend to stay in relationships with people longer than i should even when i know there not the one for me."" and i was like ""omg me too."" and hes like ""ya... i know.."" like FUCK what are you trying to say my god just tell me. fuck.

We are more like a data chip is the best way to describe us, we can be downloaded into any form. We are the peace treaties of the universe. We are in all dimensions trying to keep things together. We all have our set plans and our missions. We are very good, we are the ones that maintain the energy in our universe. We say we are more Gods of the stars. But Gods - as in theres a FUCK TON of us.

   because too many people focus on the bad, so they associate tears with pain. no, tears can be beautiful. its a symbol of emotion that is not seen by many people. if someone opens up to you and they let their tears fall down, they are effectively saying ""i trust you to not judge me in this state""

My brother and sister dont realize thats what our parents have been doing this whole time. They always complain about how they didnt teach us about debt - because they knew when they die we wont know what debt is for the rest of our lives, because they wanted us to fall flat on our faces and struggle so when we do get all this money we dont blow it. I have fucked up so many times to know that when my parents need too save one of their kids they have more than enough money.

  Dont even start about aliens with me ??

Which is why are dna have markers on it while other animals dont have any of the similar markers. Also, 93% of our dna is declared UNIDENTIFIABLE NOT FROM THIS PLANET.

  I believe religion was created for people in different parts of the world could control the masses. Each religion follows the same template or guideline. It was an easy way to make sure people aren’t just going around raping and pillaging each other.
  
  Another belief i have is that we are literally too stupid to comprehend the truth. That what we think we believe in is only a tiny grain of salt to what is actually going on since we are still learning about ourselves- they just declared they have to probably rewrite all of our history. We BARLEY know about the ocean (something we can all see and go too) but yet we claim we know what the fuck happens after death and who created us? Ya that totally makes sense.

  That they’re sorry and they understand why im pissed. Which is why they ended up being the ones who got all heated cause they know “sav is mad at me. Im fucked. I gotta figure out something quick.” Because even after i talked to them, they came back to try and fix things but I already went to bed so i heard them banging things in the kitchen cause they know they’re in deep shit. They always say, “i know when you’re really mad cause you dont yell or rage, you go silent and still. You go so quiet, you can hear your heart pumping blood. Its scary. You’re so smart that i think you’re just plotting to destroy me from the inside out.” And i always respond, “disrespect me, and ill probably shit in your heart.” Lol they dont learn.

  They can be a blessing in the sense things come a lot easier. Relationships, friendships, school, jobs, careers, and certain lifestyles

   That's actually very cool. Glad to know there's still humble people in higher statuses in the world. :)
  ","
  Theres good people out there. Theres the wealth you see flaunting in your face but my friends and i would always laugh cause the people with true wealth were behind the scenes hiding among others. Our parents taught us “dont ever talk about how much money you have.” So we learned how to adapt and when people get close to us and see our lives at home they never expect it. So theres a lot of people out there that are good and doing things for the people like charity work ect. It just sucks that the only wealth people hear about are the sports players or singers/actors but people dont realize there’s hospital owners who make over 250 million a year.. like theres some secretly wealthy people cause they are humble asf.

   will having a shit load of money make people happier?
  ","
  Nope, ive been around the wealthiest people in the world. Like only having a couple million to them was considered poor like you have to be in a certain income bracket to be able to go to the school i went too. Im pretty sure you had to make a few million a year to go to this school anyways My best friends dad is the owner of the warehouses that create light bulbs cause he invented it.. (which means i guess my family stupid wealthy too)
  
  I was around people who have the world at their fingertips and they are not happy. They put on a great show but behind the scenes its some of the ugliest family dynamics.

I learned at a young age that I can make myself hurl w/o any help (strong stomach muscles I guess?) But I haven't done that in quite a long time.
  ","
  Now thats a talent. That would be a great defense mechanism.
  
  I have PTSD from multiple things. My therapist believes my PTSD actually started when i was really really young, lots of traumatic experiences but my breaking point was when i was 17 and I almost died. It was between me and the guy - so i had to figure out how to get home... i got kidnapped and i was raped/tortured/abused and i was supposed to be sent off to a german sex ring. The guy was the son of the people in charge too. It was a dirty situation and when the FBI were involved they already knew everything they just wanted to know what i knew & i got lucky that i didnt know anything.

There was another time where i could tell something was in the house and i heard a womens bloody cry from downstairs. Then i could hear something walk upstairs and then come into the room and just stare into the corner. My bf wakes up, “i had a nightmare of this creepy dude starring over me while i was sleeping” I point in the corner and ask him if he was standing in the corner i saw and my bf freaked out.

   He should really stop doing that for his own good. You can put a wall up with anybody, but having conversations like the ones you're capable of, are extremely rare...let alone to have them with someone who's in love with you.  Shunning that is like turning your back on a blessing.

  It doesnt matter what it is, my mom always said im a pain to take shopping- that i could go to the 99cent store and find all the times that are more than that lol take me anywhere i will choose the most expensive item WITHOUT checking the price tag. Online store i will scroll through and the one im like “oooh that” ends up being super expensive. Even when i worked retail and i would see the stuff before putting it on the floor and I would pick my favorite and then I would make tags for it and itd be like $1200.00 like FUCK.

  its probably because my whole life ive always had special pet names made for me from my family or friends so i think im just used to it. its cute to me. it means that you like me enough to think of other names for me that is special to you so you literally cant forget me.

   There are people who believe the world is really flat. How would you convince them it isn’t?
  ","
  the moon - the shadow of the moon and the phases helps us know that is spherical
  
  ships and the horizon - why does it look like ships emerge from the waves?
  
  constellations - the farther you go from the equator the stars change. there are stars seen on some parts of the world that arent on other parts.
  
  shadows - when you walk around something thats on the ground making a shadow it changes shape base on the direction.
  
  the pure existence of time zones.
  
  when you go higher up you see farther than if you were flat.

  a bee, they will die instantly when they sting you, it rips out their intestines so they are most likely not gonna hurt you. and their sting isnt as bad as a wasp. also, a wasp can sting you multiple times.
