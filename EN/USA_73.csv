   What is happiness for you? ?
  ","
  i've been content at the most, but never like... genuinely happy, in a sober context. i've been joyful when i'm not sober, but when i am sober, the most i can feel is just a sense of neutrality.
  "
391649,"
   What is one thing that you have learned so far this year?
  ","
  it's perfectly valid to set boundaries with others when they're asking too much of you, and you shouldn't feel guilty for focusing on yourself instead of other people.
  
  often times when people are in toxic relationships (whether romantic or platonic or with a family member), they feel obligated to appease to them and do their every whim, especially if the person in question is demanding or manipulative or just difficult to be around. it's perfectly okay to distance yourself from that person because you need to preserve your own well being.
  "
391650,"
   What do you know well enough to teach to others? ?
  ","
  i'd say grammar and creative writing, but i've never been a good teacher at all. most of my knowledge about the subjects is something that comes naturally to me, so it's really difficult for me to really teach it to others.
  "
391651,"
   What would you take away from this last year of your life?
  ","
  2020 was a dumpster fire, as was the latter half of 2019. for me at least, it's basically been one inconvenience after the other and a lot of breakdowns.
  
  what i take away from all of this is, focus on yourself first and foremost and try to guarantee your own happiness. take each day as it comes and try not to focus so often on the past or the future. be mindful of the present moment and take time out of every day to ensure that you're doing okay.
  "
391652,"
   What would you say is your greatest strength? ? ?
  ","
  my compassion for my friends.
  "
391653,"
   How to tell if he's falling out of love with you?
  ","
  i think it varies depending on the person, because people behave in different ways.
  
  however, universally i think there would be increasing distance between you two (both emotionally and physically), a lack of effort put into the relationship, and just an overall lack of ""spark"" in the relationship that used to exist. they may feel as if the relationship is at a standstill and no one is moving forward.
  "
391654,"
   What is the worst excuse you've ever heard?
  ","
  ""it's just how i was raised.""
  
  when it comes to any sort of toxic or inappropriate thoughts or behavior, the fact that you may have been taught to do/think so by your family can be an *explanation* but not an excuse. people have the ability to take accountability for their thoughts and behaviors and unlearn toxic mindsets.
  "

  "
391661,"
   do you think all stores should make mask mandatory?
  ","
  depends on the region and how severe the COVID cases are there. masks are already pretty much mandatory where i live — you're usually asked to leave the store if you walk in not wearing a mask.
  "
391662,"
   thoughts on people refusing to wear a mask ? saying they don't trust the government?

  yeah, i totally agree. i haven't had a meltdown in a very long time thanks to medication and therapy, but unfortunately i still have a lot of rage that comes out every so often and it boils up inside of me. i honestly don't even reach out to most people anymore, i just try to deal with it on my own using unhealthy coping mechanisms. :/

   84. rant ?

  i'm really f*cking tired of coworkers from other departments undermining my authority and position as a program administrator at work. this has happened occasionally in the past, but this morning one of the sales representatives contacted a coworker of mine regarding my program and moving ahead with a client's requests and article edits without even looping me in — even though i'm the senior editor of the program and take care of all exchanges and edits.
  
  it just really peeved me. i messaged my supervisor to ask if i should have been the point of contact, and my supervisor said i definitely should have been informed by the sales representative instead of my other coworker who had nothing to do with it.
  
  it's just frustrating. the sales representatives have no respect for what my department does.

  ","
  my friends know i have BPD, but we've never really discussed it in depth and they haven't treated me any differently knowing that i have it.
  
  however, one of the things i noticed when i was dating my ex is that he had difficulty in understanding my breakdowns, i.e. how really simple things caused me to have a meltdown or rage episode. he did his best in helping me but he couldn't understand why it happened, and it was hard for me to try to explain it without sounding irrational.

   How is BPD diagnosed? Does one have to hit all symptoms to be diagnosed or?
  ","
  BPD is a bit difficult to diagnose because there's often overlap with symptoms consistent with other mental illnesses, and people with BPD also struggle with anxiety and depression and/or PTSD, among others.
  
  to be diagnosed by a psychiatrist or psychologist, they normally do a psychiatric examination and a medical examination to rule out external factors. you're asked questions and you must meet at least 5 out of the 9 diagnostic criteria to be diagnosed.

   Give your most unpopular/controversial opinion about relationships.

  i don't know if this isn't necessarily unpopular, but i think it's wrong for someone to be so obsessive over their partner that they feel the need to interject in every one of their plans, i.e. feeling the need to always be there when their partner is hanging out with their friends or straight up not ""allowing"" them to see certain people without them around.
  
  in addition, a person shouldn't offer an opinion on how their partner dresses or acts unless it's directly hurting themselves or someone else. there's no reason to try to exert that much control over another person. you're an individual first and foremost, you aren't defined by your relationship and your partner is not an extension of you.
  "
391737,"

  i don't brush it off, but i don't confront them about it either because i know it's irrational. i just worry about it for a while until i get so fed up that i ask them ""are you mad at me?"" and then i feel better when they say no.

  i used to very much be a night person, but as i've taken on jobs that required me to wake up early in the morning, i've become more of a morning person than anything else. i enjoy waking up early because i can be productive throughout the course of the day and not feel as if i've wasted a day.

  no, i don't believe that everything happens for a reason. there are terrible things that happen to people for no good reason whatsoever, and not everything is a lesson or a means of teaching someone something. somethings people get the sh*t end of the stick, and we have to adjust and deal with it.

  yes, absolutely. tbh, i find it a bit annoying when i'm out with a friend and they're on their phone the entire time. :/ i feel like they aren't truly valuing the time we're spending together.
  
  i can understand checking it every so often, but if a friend is on their phone legit the *entire* time we're hanging out, then i get annoyed.

   Hi Leigh I need help to decipher whether this is a personal problem or a problem because of BPD. So is it normal to not know who you are but when you find a goal or something you “like” you go all in but after a while you lose interest and you don’t like it again and lose motivation and dk who you r
  ","
  it could be either, tbh. it could be part of BPD, but it could also just be inherently a part of who you are naturally. it isn't really uncommon for people to sorta ""define"" themselves by their interests if they don't have a steady sense of self.
  
  however, i can most definitely relate to this. i really have no idea who/what i am most of the time, and i often become obsessive over new interests or pursuits until eventually i lost interest, and then because i lost interest in them, i lose a sense of who i am again. it's a weird cycle.

Why do you trust them more or less?
  ","
  i suppose i have more of an inclination to trust someone more if they confide in me that they've suffered through things in the past. not only because they've suffered and i can relate to that, but also because they entrusted that information with me to begin with, and it makes me more comfortable when someone can trust me before i make the decision on whether or not to trust them in return.

  ","
  i don't believe you're being too much, not at all. it's normal to crave attention from our partners, especially if there are things in the way that are preventing you from conversing with or seeing your partner to begin with.
  
  really though, a person *should* take the time out of their day to talk to you -- even if it's just a short five minute phone call in the middle of the day. you'll always find time for those you care about, so i do believe this is a conversation you should have with your boyfriend.

  they're unique like dogs in that obviously they all have their own personalities, but it's silly to do the whole dog vs. cat thing because animals as a whole are great. i've also had fish in the past, and my ex had a lot of reptiles too.

  perhaps instead of cutting her off completely, talk to her about it instead. by removing all alcohol from the house prior to having a conversation about it, she's going to feel attacked, humiliated, angry, and ashamed. she's going to probably lash out and find even more adverse ways of coping with her feelings.
  
  just talk to her about her usage and how you're worried about her. if you approach it the wrong way, you're going to send her spiraling.

  i've had this happen to me on a few occasions. :/ especially last sunday when i had a telephone appointment with my psychiatrist, i was kinda venting to her and she cut me off and recommended that i try to continue therapy again.
  
  on the one hand, yeah your doctor is really there to just prescribe you meds depending on how you're feeling. but in order to do so, you really need to discuss those feelings somewhat in depth to see what will work best for you.
  
  if your doctor is rushing you off the phone or out of the office and you don't feel like you're worthy of their time, then maybe you should consider finding another doctor. ideally, your doctor should be a person you feel comfortable around — especially when it comes to mental health needs.

  "
392018,"
   The way you wrote “Mexican and halal food” like halal is an actual cuisine made my brain hurt. You like Arabic/Turkish/Middle Eastern food etc. You probably drink alcohol with your halal food. Alcohol isn’t halal btw, so you don’t care that it’s halal you just enjoy the cuisine.

  "
392020,"
   But you don’t care whether its halal or not, that’s not why you are buying it. You’re being disrespectful by using the term in the way you do. It’s not a brand ffs
  ","
  i never said it was a brand. it's a descriptor to refer to what type of food it is in my area — there are places called ""shah's halal food"" and ""naz's halal food"" and ""the halal guys,"" among other restaurants. so when i say i'm craving halal food, i mean food specifically made in those types of arab restaurants. a lot of them are chain restaurants.
  
  perhaps i was raised in ignorance, idk. i like the food because it's prepared fresh, it isn't greasy, it's delicious, and i don't feel gross after i eat it like most other foods.
  "
392021,"
   If someone asked you what you wanted to get for takeaway you don’t say “halal food”. They wouldn’t know what you wanted. They’d just assume you were Muslim. “halal” isn’t a food, it refers to the way food is prepared eg animals need to be slaughtered in a certain way etc.
  ","
  i know what it means, lol. but that's the way we refer to it where i live — in reference to food. if i ask my roommate what he wants for dinner and he says ""halal food,"" then i know where to order from. there are dozens of halal food places here.
  "
392022,"
   Well, that’s what you would say then “I like gyros and lamb platters”.
  ","
  it's specifically from halal food places where i live, which is why i specify it in that way. i know halal is a catch-all arabic word in technical terms, but that's the way the word is used with respect to food here.

  "
392037,"
   Yeah exactly it is unaffordable unless you are a doctor, corporate lawyer, or in the stock market making 6 figures. It’s just would be hard to save money and even pay bills if the rent is so high. The sad thing is even though you pay high amount of rent the apartments aren’t even good at all.
  ","
  yep, that's exactly it — even basement apartments are 900+. and that's assuming you're going to live in an actually liveable basement. :/
  
  my rent is really high, but renting a house with two other people was literally the only way i would be able to afford to move out of my parents house. now that it's been quite a few months, i've gotten into sorta a groove when it comes to my finances and bills so i'm somewhat comfortable, but it's still ridiculous.
  "
392038,"
   I was asking since you were from New York I wanted to know if it was true about the housing prices? I’m sure about the place you live but I heard in Manhattan the average price of a 1 bedroom apartment is over $2000 a month.
  ","
  it wouldn't surprise me. regular one-bedroom apartments on long island are between 1200-2000 per month (1100-1200 was the lowest i could find after apartment searching for months last year). obviously i can't afford that.
  
  the city is extraordinarily expensive, so it's probably 2000 at the lowest there.

  no, that has never been something that appealed to me.
  "

  depends on the context and whether or not it'll ultimately hurt you in the end. there's a thin line between giving someone what they deserve and then hurting yourself in the process.

   what is your opinion on nepotism in politics and workplaces
  ","
  i think it's terrible — just because someone is a family member or friend doesn't mean they're more qualified for the job than someone else. it creates an uncomfortable work environment, and ideally people should be hired based on skill level as opposed to having an interpersonal relation.

392178,"

  school is sorta an umbrella term that encompasses *all* institutions of academia, such as elementary schools, high schools, colleges, and universities. a college refers to a two-year or four-year institution of higher learning.
  
  at least, in american english. i'm sure it's different in other countries.

  "
392202,"
   What would you do if you’re in a monogamous relationship with a person the relationship is just BOMB, but you figure out that polyamory is more what you’re looking for, but your partner finds the thought of you being with others uncomfortable? Communication already happens. Asking for a friend.
  ","
  i had a similar situation with my ex when we were dating, in that we talked about having an open relationship so that he could be fulfilled sexually during the times i had a very low libido and was never in the mood. eventually, it never happened because i realized i was uncomfortable with it myself and we dropped the subject.
  
  if i was into polyamory and my partner was uncomfortable with the idea, then i would respect their feelings and continue with the relationship as it currently is. if the relationship is already great and communication is wonderful, then ideally nothing bad could come of that situation/conversation. you have to respect your own partner first and foremost.
  "
392203,"
   Ever notice a user on other pages that acts really nice and like a cool friend but then when they talk to you their pervy side kind of comes out which doesn't make you trust them as much?
  ","
  i don't trust people in general, but i've never really come across anyone like that. i make it a point not to interact with a lot of people on askfm with the exception of people whom i've known for a long time. normally, those advances are immediately deleted anyway, so it doesn't go very far.
  "
392204,"
   59. what makes someone a good person?
  ","
  similar to my answer to your last question, a good person is someone who has good intentions and goes out of their way to act on those intentions and spread good will towards friends, family, community, etc etc.
  "
392205,"
   58. what makes someone a bad person? in your opinion
  ","
  having malicious thoughts and acting upon those thoughts with ill intent, knowing full well what they're doing is wrong. the fact that it's conventionally wrong doesn't stop them from doing what they want to do, and they normally act selfishly.
  "
392206,"
   Did you grow up with both parents in your home or in a single parent household? Do you think this effected you in any way?
  ","
  i grew up with both parents in my house, and it negatively affected me because they argued every day, which made tensions in the house very high. i was always afraid to come home after school because i didn't know what i was walking into.
  
  there was talk of divorce, but it never happened. my mother became disabled and started relying on us as caregivers, so my father probably felt obligated to stay.
  "
392207,"
   Singing ? or playing ?
  ","
  i prefer singing, solely because i'm terrible at playing instruments.
  "
392208,"
   Gym ?? or couch ?
  ","
  couch, considering i barely have the motivation to exercise as of late.
  "
392209,"
   Do you find drunk people amusing or do they make you anxious?
  ","
  it depends on their personality, because everyone behaves differently when they're drunk. luckily, all of my friends are happy-go-lucky people when they're drunk or drinking, haha. we always have a good time together.
  "
392210,"
   What instantly makes you happy when you’re having a bad day?
  ","
  depends on how terrible of a day i'm having. sometimes nothing can cheer me up and i just need to try to sleep it off, while other times talking to my friends about what happened helps.
  "
392211,"
   Do you think pxrn affects relationships?
  ","
  it definitely can, yeah. p*rn can lead to people having unrealistic expectations when it comes to sex, as well as a lot of misinformation regarding sex. it could negatively affect a relationship that poses significance on sex, especially if the couple doesn't communicate very well.
  "
392212,"
   Would you rather be the sun or the moon??
  ","
  i've always felt more connected to the moon, and i often use it in metaphors and in reference in my creative writing pieces.
  "
392213,"
   Which planet do you think is the most beautiful??
  ","
  pluto, even though it technically isn't a planet anymore. smh.
  "
392214,"
   If you had lots of money what would you do with it?
  ","
  depends on how much is actually there, haha. i would try to pay off all of my debt, buy my roommate a new car, and buy a house for myself/my friends to live in (or just live alone, but i'd be content with just an apartment for that).
  "
392215,"

  "
392219,"
   was there a lot of drama?
  ","
  no, not very much at all. the topic was brought up after my brother left, but we didn't go too deeply into it and no voices were raised, so i'm relieved. i told my mother i didn't want to discuss this in depth on a holiday that's supposed to be celebrating my father (especially because he was a bit sad since he just lost his dad two months ago). she said okay and we dropped the subject. she wants to talk about it all eventually, though.

  moving on isn't something that happens by choice — it happens naturally, and considering we were together for 10 years, it's natural for me to still have feelings for him months after we've broken up.
  
  i'm taking each day as it comes, and that's all i can really do for myself. i came to terms with the breakup months ago, it's just a matter of getting over my feelings.

  honestly, it is just an idea. who knows if it'll actually happen, but my roommate did offer to take me with him if he decides to go there because he doesn't want to leave me hanging in a toxic environment.

   It's natural to feel guilty because unlike your mother you feel compassion. Most of us would do too. You feel the way you feel despite that you get abuse is the result of her deliberate conditioning. Helps to listen to your mind, rather than your heart.

  that's always been my difficulty in life — i live mostly according to my heart, and i've also always tried to believe that people can change. i thought things would get better after i moved out, but it's almost as if she's trying to strengthen her reins because i'm one step closer to being out of her life.

   It’s okay to be hesitant it’s a big Decision to cut off family even if they were not the best to you because they are always connected to you.

   You will feel SO much better after you cut them off and go no contact. This is narcissistic abvse and you don't deserve it, I'm so sorry. I know how difficult it is. Maybe you can talk to other people who did the same or read up on it so you don't feel too alone or unsure.

   If this was a friend or something that would be different but since she is your mother it’s just a complicated situation where there are pros and cons to both I can’t speculate since we grew up to different ways but all I can say is do what you feel like is the best for you and your mental health.

  cutting them off would be the best for my mental health. i'm not sure why i'm so hesitant to do that. i guess part of me feels guilty, especially considering my father isn't a bad person. i just don't see any other option. :/

  i honestly don't know at this point. everyone tells me to cut them off, and i know they're right. i guess i've just been so brainwashed and manipulated that i would still feel guilty, of all things, and that just means she still has that control over me.

  not to mention the fact that during this whole pandemic, my mother still wanted me to come over and do things when it wasn't exactly something that was necessary. as if she didn't understand the gravity of the situation. when my father was in florida, i did everything i could but i also went there in a mask and gloves only when something necessary needed to be done. she couldn't understand it. she'd ask me to come over for breakfast and she'd get angry when i told her i shouldn't because of how bad the pandemic was at that time.

  she also relies on my aunt and brother as well, and they just put up with it. as far as i know, they've never brought up the topic of hiring an aide, and i'm thinking it's because it might be easier for them to just suck it up and do what she says rather than try to help the situation as a whole.
  "
392260,"
   I don’t see anything wrong with how you responded, it’s perfectly logical! You can’t always drop things suddenly, especially with being in a work environment. It’s plausible she has no idea just how her behaviour is coming across - but either way, it certainly doesn’t excuse it. :(
  ","
  thank you — i'm just so nervous that she's going to bring it up tomorrow when i go there for lunch/dinner. i just want to pretend she never texted me any of that. i'm not ready to explode on her and explain to her that she's been hurting me since i was a teenager, probably even before that. i really just wish i could live my life the way i want to for once.

  my ex tells me the same thing, actually. he knows the situations i've had with her over all of these years, and he's always told me to cut her off because she's destroying me.
  
  my father is there to help her, and they have the option of hiring an aide so i don't know why they've never done that.
  "
392262,"
   Sounds like she's trying to rope you in and keep you in her circle of influence. Narcissists do that. And boomers in general are self-centered lol. tbh it's not unreasonable to draw the line and prioritise your own responsibilities considering the circumstances.
  ","
  that's what my friends are telling me too when i've talked to them about it. like, i'm living my own life now and i can't cater to her every whim when she asks me to. life doesn't work that way — i have my own house to maintain, responsibilities to take care of, and 40 hours of work a week to do.
  
  idk if she just doesn't understand that working from home is no different from me working in the office, i can't just get up and leave. i just have no idea where this is even coming from, and really i shouldn't be upset over this because that means she's getting what she wants out of me, but i can't help it. :/

  it just makes me question myself, like — am i in the wrong here? or is she just gaslighting me to the extent that it's making me question myself all over again? she's always tried to exert control over everything in my life, and i don't know if she even realizes what she's done to me or if she's just continuing to be manipulative.

   Oh whiskey usually whisks me to the town centre in no time lmao. What's up with your parents?
  ","
  it's a really long story.
  
  to shorten it a bit... my mother is disabled, and she requires my help every now and again (especially a few months ago when my father was down in florida). she has a bad habit of asking me to help her very last minute. earlier in the week, she asked me to come to her house during my lunch break at work to help her. it wasn't plausible — i wouldn't have had enough time to drive there, help her, and drive back. so i explained this to her, and she got angry and hung up on me.
  
  a few minutes later, i got a really angry text from my aunt telling me to go there *now* and she doesn't want to hear excuses. i told her i only had 10 minutes left until i had to clock back into work. she proceeded to berate me, tell me ""i hope you sleep well at night,"" etc. i told her i could go there after 5:30pm when i clock out of work, and she said ""your dad is home at that point, so nice try."" i was calm the entire time i was talking to her and eventually she just ignored me.
  
  fast forward to today. i had a busy afternoon planned, and my mother texts me last minute asking to go to her house and clean. i told her i couldn't because i was busy, but i'll see her and my father tomorrow for father's day. then i received a 5-paragraph long text message about how inconsiderate i am, how i'm not even her child, how i never help out, how ungrateful i have been my entire life, how she gave me everything, etc etc.
  
  needless to say, i got really angry. she's physically & mentally ab*sed me for 15+ years, and i thought i would have peace of mind after i moved out but apparently it's only gotten worse. i have no idea what to even do.

  a lot of it has to do with self confidence. ideally, you shouldn't be afraid to talk to someone because they're only human with their own thoughts, feelings, aspirations, etc etc., just like you do. the best option is to simply put yourself out there, and if heartache is involved, then you'll handle that if/when the time comes. you won't gain anything by being too afraid to make that first step.

   So I've formed a BPD attachment from hell to a man but deep down inside I know we aren't truly compatible or have much in common except for our mutual lust for each other. He seems to want a real relationship and my BPD is flattered by that but my brain knows it wouldn't be right.
  ","
  (cont) ... What do you think I should do? I feel bad every time we do sxxual things (even though it's not irl, just over the phone when I feel bored and lonely) bc it makes me even more unhealthily attached to him but neither of us can control ourselves. I've tried distancing myself from him and that hasn't worked either. like I said, I feel like without that sxxual aspect or me cracking stupid jokes to get a laugh, it would be radio silence between us and it hurts bc part of me still wants him around. I would appreciate your input, thanks /:
  
  --
  
  sorry it's taken me so long to answer this, i've been wanting to answer it on my laptop because it's easier to copy/paste the questions into one block.
  
  you really do have to listen to your gut on this one -- if you know that the relationship won't be right or work out at all, then you can't keep putting yourself in a position where you're going to be hurt. i understand the BPD attachment all too well so i know that it's difficult as hell, but you have to try to wrangle it and exercise rationality and control over yourself. you have to think about your own happiness first and foremost, and this sounds like a toxic/addictive situation. :/ especially considering the sxxual aspect is a large component of your relationship/friendship.
  
  i don't know how helpful this really is, but i really do empathize with how you're feeling. i've had really strong BPD attachments before and i currently have 2-3 ""favorite people"" (which is f*cking hell), so i understand you.

  i didn't have much authority over it because i wasn't a manager, but if we were suspicious of someone who was stealing, we would basically ""kill them with kindness."" and if they did leave the store with items, then we would make a police report. we couldn't actually *do* anything unless they left the physical store, and even then, we couldn't do anything ourselves outside of the store. :/
  
  i did personally catch a few people stealing -- they were loading up shopping carts with really expensive items, and the game was that someone would leave the shopping cart in the store, someone else would come in, and they would take the shopping cart outside. i intercepted a lot of those carts and left them behind the cashier counter, lol.

  if they're spewing hateful/oppressive/discriminatory comments either online or IRL, if they're not putting the same effort into the friendship as i am and won't change their ways after discussing it, if they become rude or arrogant or entitled to certain things or friendships, and/or if they're being manipulative and ab*sive.

   Do you like movies that have intermission?
  ","
  i don't generally go to the movie theater, haha. i don't think i've ever seen a movie long enough that required an intermission, tbh. i much prefer watching movies at home, where i can pause whenever i need to to get food and snacks, or use the bathroom without missing anything.

   Honestly I h8 the new askfm update, now we have a blurred  background pictures that almost covers half of the screen! Are you serious? Ugh ?

  i don't believe i have the update on my phone yet. i'm not entirely sure, i've been using my laptop to answer questions this evening.
  "
392450,"
   sorry if this is rude to ask but has the break up made you think you’re not good enough to find someone new?
  ","
  no, i haven't felt that way at all. i just have zero interest in pursuing a new relationship or even dating in general.
  "
392451,"
   Are you doing well now?
  ","
  eh, yes and no. i have a stable job and whatnot, but my mental health ranges between being absolutely amazing to being in the trash within the course of a few hours.
  
  i'm medicated now and i engaged in therapy for like, 2-3 years, but i still can't help but feel whatever mood swings i feel at any particular moment. i also recently dealt with a break up, so that has really f*cked with my emotions over the past few months.

  ","
  hi friends, my inbox is basically empty.
  
  send me some interesting/appropriate questions. :'))
  "
392453,"
   What do you prefer to drink?
  ","
  honestly, i'm not all that picky. it really depends on my mood that day.
  
  i enjoy drinking beer, especially lagers and IPAs. as for liquor, my favorite is tequila but i also like light rum and amaretto. in addition, my favorite wine is sauvignon blanc.
  "
392454,"
   ohoo take care of yourself
  ","
  that's pretty questionable, lol. i do enough to get by, do my job efficiently, and pay my bills on time. that's all that really matters at the moment.
  "
392455,"
   you drink regularly ?
  ","
  yeah, i drink alcohol on a fairly regular basis.
  "
392456,"
   If you could go back to any age or time of your life, what age or time would it be?
  ","
  probably sometime in my early-to-mid 20s, when i was living my life to the fullest and going on vacations 2-3 times per year and was otherwise managing my mental illnesses well before i had a breakdown when i was 25 years old. i was working towards my bachelor's degree and felt extremely educated, and i was also writing a lot creatively.
  "
392457,"
   your symptoms?
  ","
  when i'm anxious, it feels as if my heart is beating out of my chest cavity. i get extremely overheated and sweat profusely. i get vertigo and light-headed. my mind races. my stomach churns and makes me nauseous. i can't breathe. etc etc.
  
  i used to be diagnosed with panic disorder, but i'm pretty sure it's in remission now because i haven't had a panic attack in quite a few months.
  "
392458,"
   Don't tell you, this will be a secret between you and me
  ","
  LOL. again, the answer is a resounding no.
  "
392459,"
   why
I just want to talk to you privately?
  ","
  i don't talk to people privately. if that's what you're aiming for, then you can kindly leave my page. this is a question and answer site, after all.
  "
392460,"
   ok 
I can follow your Instagram or Facebook
  ","
  no, i don't give those usernames out. askfm is the only place you can contact me.
  "
392461,"
   Why you take xanax
  ","
  i have anxiety disorders, so my doctor prescribed me xanax to manage my symptoms.
  "
392462,"

  ","
  it isn't a fact, it is simply an opinion. regardless, thank you for the compliment.
  "
392463,"
   44. do you like your aunts and uncles?
  ","
  i'm not close to anyone in my family at all, and i only really see my aunts and uncles on holidays (sometimes, we've been seeing them less lately over the past few years). my aunt on my mother's side is probably the one to whom i'm closest.
  "
392464,"
   ok sorry 
your face is so beautiful ?
  ","
  i appreciate the compliment.
  "
392465,"

  ","
  you asked me this already, lol. i said i was drinking coffee, listening to music, and perusing social media.
  "
392466,"
   43. do you like to go to bars?
  ","
  i'm very picky when it comes to bars, and there are only two bars that i regularly visited before COVID-19 happened. the rest of the time, i preferred going to brewing companies since there are a lot on long island.
  "
392467,"

  you're speaking to me now.
  "
392470,"
   how are you
  ","
  hello ~~
  
  i'm doing fine. i'm currently listening to music, perusing social media, and drinking coffee.
  "
392471,"
   a lot of people are out of their jobs though. you can’t be sure nothing will change.
  ","
  there were quite a few people from my office who were furloughed because of COVID-19, we were losing revenue. i wasn't one of them, thankfully.
  
  the situation is slowly getting better in new york, and company-wise, we're making just as much money now as we were before COVID-19 hit new york state. i'm comfortable in saying that my job is very stable right now.
  "
392472,"
   If people were required to post the bad as well as the good stuff that happened to them on social media, would social media platforms be more or less popular than they are now?
  ","
  i don't believe the popularity of social media would change much, because as much good there is on social media that people like to talk about, there are also others who feel comfortable to post the bad things that have happened to them as well. in fact, posting the bad things may make people more compassionate and receptive to others because it only proves that we're all human and endure similar struggles, even if the circumstances are different.
  "
392473,"
   Are you worried you won’t have a job because of Covid-19?
  ","
  no, if that was the case then i would have been unemployed months ago. i've been working remotely from home since mid-march.
  "
392474,"
   What is your idea of perfect relationship?
  ","
  a perfect relationship, in my opinion, is a relationship where you have the same sense of humor so that you can enjoy the same things together, while also maintaining a distinction between both of your interests. while you share similar interests to some degree, it's also important to have different interests as well to maintain your sense of self outside of the relationship.
  
  relationships are also meant to be open and you should be able to communicate effectively with your partner, regardless of how awkward or difficult the topic is. your partner should ideally be open and responsive to what you have to say, and vice versa, and not restrict you from being your true, authentic self.
  "
392475,"
   If someone created a bar or cafe with just your tastes in mind, what would it look like?
  ","
  it would be a small, quaint bar with a wooden bar stand, 5-10 taps behind the bar with a big mirror to make the space look bigger, and antique lighting hanging above the bar and within the bar itself. there would be a large outdoor seating area adorned with string lights and plants, with an interior design made of dark wood and metal (sorta industrial, but also modern). the bar stools would be cushioned with soft, velvet material and there would also be an area in the back where you can order simple bar food, like loaded fries or sliders or pretzels and dip.
  "
392476,"
   What fictional character would you date? ?
  ","
  i've always been attracted to the idea of lestat from anne rice's vampire chronicles, haha. also, draco malfoy from the harry potter series and patrick bateman from american psycho.
  "
392477,"
   What was the last big mistake you made?
  ","
  drinking three glasses of wine last night, followed by eight xanax pills before going to bed. it calmed me down following my mental breakdown, but i woke up horribly foggy and unstable this morning. i was unsure if i would be able to focus on the computer screen at work because i was so disoriented.
  "
392478,"
   What is the meaning of happiness!!????
  ","
  i suppose happiness can be defined as being content, and possibly even joyful, with yourself and your surroundings. you're self-assured and have a direct idea of where you're headed in life, and you do everything in your power to complete your goals.
  "
392479,"
   what makes you selfish? did your ex think that too?
  ","
  my ex doesn't think i'm selfish, at least that i'm aware of, lol. if anything, he's described me as selfless because i dedicated myself fully to him.
  
  i've always thought i was selfish because, for one my parents instilled that idea in me from a very young age. i grew up convinced i was selfish and everything i did was self-serving without the consideration of other people. it's followed me through to adulthood and i still often think of myself without how it will affect other people.
  "
392480,"
   40. how was your day?
  ","
  my day has been fine, although tiring. because of my breakdown last night, i woke up extremely exhausted and mentally/physically unstable. i managed to make it through the entire work day, but i laid in bed for like two hours afterwards because i was mentally drained.
  
  i didn't even have dinner tonight, i'm simply not hungry. i'm just drinking coffee and trying to relax myself with calming music and social media.
  "
392481,"
   41. do you currently miss anyone or anything?
  ","
  yeah, i miss my friends most of all. when this whole COVID-19 situation has calmed down, i'm definitely inviting a lot of friends over to the house and having a party, lol.
  "
392482,"
   are you really selfish?
  ","
  i believe i am, yes.
  "
392483,"
   Are you scared of coronavirus?
  ","
  not so much anymore, no. i *was* terrified of it when it was at its peak in new york, especially when i was still working in the office, but now that i've been out a few times to the grocery store and pharmacy and hardware store, etc etc., i've calmed down a bit.
  "
392484,"
   How would you describe yourself?
  ","
  mentally unstable, self-destructive, selfish, manipulative, and addictive. at the same time, i'm also very dedicated to both my work and my friends, creative, passionate, and emotional.
  "
392485,"
   Whats your Biggest dream in life?
  ","
  my biggest dream/goal/aspiration is to publish a book, or at least a collection of essays and short stories.
  "
392486,"
   Are you generally a more optimistic or pessimistic person?
  ","
  if i had to choose between the two, i would say pessimistic. however, i'm actually a realist more than anything else. i try not to be too optimistic or too pessimistic about anything, although i definitely do have my moments where my pessimism comes out.
  "
392487,"

NOVEL OR WATTPAD? ?
  ","
  i would much rather read a novel, holding a physical book in my hand. staring at screens too much hurts my eyes, and it's much easier for me to read a physical book as opposed to an e-book or collection of online stories.

392488,"

  when i order online, yes. however, i have a terrible habit of obsessively tracking delivery progress, LOL.
  
  when i text a friend, not so much. it also really depends on what i'm texting them about, because if it's about a serious topic, then i get extremely anxious while waiting for their reply.
  "
392498,"
   How often do you feel lonely?
  ","
  i feel lonely on occasion, but it's more of a mental loneliness than a physical loneliness. i'm home with either one or both of my roommates throughout most of the day, and while i'm working, i'm frequently in contact with my coworkers through messages or emails.
  
  my loneliness mainly comes late at night when everyone is sleeping and i'm just laying awake in bed.

  "
392504,"
   I generally have normal amount of alcohol. But one time I had more, to see how much I can drink, but I puked. After that I have lost appetite for alcohol. I feel like throwing up now when I try to drink. Never was the case before. Asking bc I moderately drink and have fun.

  i don't pay much attention to things like that when i'm out and about. i really have ever gone out to see my friends, and that's it (even before COVID).

  that seems a bit extreme for your mother to want to find out if you're pregnant through blood work, not going to lie. pregnancy tests are fast and easy, though. i recommend taking more than one because sometimes you can get a false reading.

  not in recent years, no. i probably did this when i was much younger and less self-assured, and wanted the person to still like me regardless of what they've done. however, since then i've retained a bit of confidence in who i am and i don't allow people to use me in an effort to further their own reputation.
  "
392608,"
   My question for today is ""Why do people ignore the truth?""
  ","
  it depends on the situation, because people choose to ignore the truth for a number of reasons. sometimes it can be because the truth is too painful for them to bear, so they ignore it or distance themselves from it in an effort to prevent themselves from feeling the pain.
  "
392609,"
   What is something you’re currently anxious about/too scared to do, but hope to do in the future?

  no, i wouldn't. my family's opinion isn't valuable to me at all because i'm not close with my family. this has already happened to me in the past with my most recent ex -- they didn't like him and didn't want me to be with him because of things he had done in the past, but it never swayed my opinion.

  my aspirations to eventually become a published novelist in the future. i haven't exactly worked towards that goal, per say, because i've never started a novel. however, i do have a brilliant idea for a novel that i might want to write in the future once i find the motivation to expand upon the idea and write a timeline/layout.

  idk, i don't really have many hobbies besides listening to music, writing, and playing video games, lol. i get asked some questions about them every now and again.
  
  when it comes to video games, i've been playing games since i was a child. i remember playing on my cousin's N64 and i think someone else in my family had the old NES console too. my first device was the original gameboy, and i played it constantly. then i got the gameboy advance and eventually i got the original xbox. i've been buying xbox consoles since then.

   so im trying to become educated more with the 'this/them/they' bc i dont know much about them , and wanted to ask you a question and i hope it is not too personal. my question is: how do we know this is a 3rd gender?
  ","
  they/them are pronouns for people who don't identify as she/her or he/him. they're considered gender neutral pronouns.
  
  however, gender can't really be quantified because it exists on a spectrum. you have the two gender binaries (man and woman) and what exists in between. personally, i just identify as non-binary because i'm neither a man nor a woman.

  honestly, i don't believe that's hyperbolic at all. this has had such a devastating impact on society and people's lives that it's weird to imagine things going back to what we thought of as ""normal.""
  
  restaurants and bars have opened up with restrictions, for example. but i'm terrified to go because people don't really *have* to wear masks at their outdoor tables, which i think sorta defeats the purpose. idk.

392686,"

  "
392709,"
   Completely the right idea. If you jump back into it you'll just tire yourself out and stop going because you aren't enjoying it

  that was my thinking too. i also don't want to over-exert myself right off the bat. i'll probably start going only twice per week and then increase depending on how i'm feeling/progressing.
  "
392710,"
   I think that's most peoples perspective on it ?. Hard work pays off though for sure
  ","
  most definitely. i felt good that i was contributing to my health and losing weight.
  
  after gyms open back up again after COVID is over, i'm probably going to go back and start little by little. i'm extremely out of shape so i'm thinking of starting small instead of jumping right into it.

392711,"
   Did you enjoy going to the gym before you lost motivation?
  ","
  somewhat, yeah. i enjoyed the aftermath of it more than actually exercising itself, lol.
  "
392712,"
   Have a night out or evening in?
  ","
  depends on my mood. because of quarantine and staying inside for about three months now, i've been aching to go out, lol.
  
  some restaurants and bars are open with outdoor seating, but i'm still wary because no one has to wear a mask at their table and everywhere just seems super crowded.

  it really makes me wonder. he declined so quickly.

392795,"
   Why do people act like social media is bad? My grandma who's 60 - she was a lonely girl growing up who didn't really fit in nor went out. She had no friends. and one morning she told me that she regrets not being born in the technology era, it would've been a good escape.

  ","
  i don't think her reasoning is silly, no. everyone has their reasons to break up with someone, and like you said, she seemed to feel bad about ending the relationship but it was something that had to be done.
  
  i wouldn't dwell on it too much, tbh. if she didn't see it getting serious anywhere down the road then there's not much you can do except focus on other things to get your mind off of her and move forward with your life.

  it isn't really all that difficult to be healthy in the united states, because although there are a lot of processed foods, there are also just as much fresh foods to purchase at the grocery store. sometimes it can be a little bit more expensive, but it's less expensive to shop for groceries than to eat out.

   I was talking to a girl I met and really liked online for a month and a half. We talked almost everyday. The relationship did have a s.exual element because there was lust between us as well. She told me she was concerned about us growing too attached to each other
  ","
  (cont) And said she doesn't want us to continue with the romantic talk and s.exual stuff if we don't see things actually getting serious so no one gets hurt. I said ok but we both still continued to give into it. Even tho I wanna be with her long term, I still wanted her to feel comfortable. Today she called me and said she decided it would be best if we didn't talk anymore, because she thinks our feelings will only grow and it won't amount to anything bc she doesn't see us in a serious relationship or anything down the road. And that she's recently become more Religious and thinks our lustful relationship isn't condusive to the new path she's taken. She seemed to feel really bad about it but she said it's what she decided is best. I feel angry and heartbroken. Do you have any advice? I will miss her so much
  
  --
  
  you have to respect her decision, first and foremost. relationships of any kind are a two-way street, and they won't work if someone isn't involved in the relationship but the other person cares too much. if she says she doesn't want to pursue this any longer, you have to respect that decision and let her go.
  
  i understand it may be difficult, but perhaps it is for the best. the only thing you can really do from this point is focus on yourself and your own happiness, while also respecting her and not pushing the subject any more.

  (cont) ... i told him about my disorders then he got angry and told me that it’s not a competition and i felt so bad for opening up. do you think it was wrong of me to share my issues?
  
  --
  
  no, you weren't in the wrong at all. he shouldn't have interpreted it as a ""competition,"" and honestly he should have realized you were saying that as a means to relate to him and make him feel more secure instead of trying to one-up him.
  
  i'm sorry that he made you feel bad, but you definitely weren't in the wrong here at all. it's natural for people to divulge their personal issues/medical issues when someone does it first because it acts as a way to relate to the person further.

  i totally understand that. initially i thought that my mental health would be worse off while working from home, when in reality it's gotten so much better because of the lack of stress of being in the office, lack of anxiety driving two hours per day, etc etc. i feel more comfortable, i don't even feel burnt out by the end of the day, and i use my breaks to clean the house so i feel even *more* productive.
  
  my company is super confidential too, which is why i'm also not surprised they haven't said anything. it's to be expected at this point. however, people's main concern is that they're going to tell us, like ... for example, on friday that we'll have to return to the office on monday. it won't give anyone time to really prepare for that change. especially the parents who have been working from home.

  i'm not really sure what a social media influencer is exactly (unless you mean like, youtubers or something?). however, i believe that people have a moral obligation to speak out against injustice, or at the very least do their part in fighting against racism and police brutality — whether that's raising awareness online, signing petitions, donating to bail funds, buying from black-owned businesses, attending protests, etc etc.
  
  if you're in a position of influence, then i do think it is part of your responsibility to speak out against racism for your followers even if that isn't necessarily part of your ""job."" if you have your own private reasons to not speak out, then that can be respected, but i also don't believe that people should just ignore what's happening.

   everyone is good at something. some have a way with words, others have a physical and a mental strength to protest. saying it’s just “for clout” is a defeatist shxtty attitude that accomplishes nothing, let people voice their oppression and support rather than shushing them.
  ","
  this is copied/pasted from a friend of mine on fb ;
  
  ""-- without social media, no one would have seen george floyd, philando castile, or ahmaud arbery d*e.
  
  -- without social media, these protests would have taken WEEKS to be organized by any other means.
  
  -- without social media, #BlackLivesMatter wouldn’t even exist.
  
  -- without social media,  police officers around the nation wouldn’t have been exposed for the brutes they are nearly as fast. CONVERSELY, without social media you wouldn’t see the officers who are also standing with us, marching with us & kneeling with us.
  
  -- without social media, the current zeitgeist of political & social change would not be taking place right now.

   Do you judge people quickly?
  ","
  so like ... my house is definitely a little haunted, lmaoo. we had another experience two nights ago.
  
  -- my roommate was awake around 3-4:00am, when me and my other roommate were fast asleep. he then heard a really loud sigh coming from his own bedroom that wasn't his own, nor was it his cats, but he turned on his lights and nothing was there.
  
  other strange occurrences ;
  
  -- last week, i was in the kitchen and my roommate was in his bedroom playing video games. our other roommate has a habit of making that weird ""squeak"" sound through his lips when he's thinking. however, at that moment he was at work. my roommate and i both heard that sound, and my roommate calls out, ""leigh, is [name] home?"" and i go ""no, he's at work."" then we both realized we heard the same exact sound, but neither of us did it.
  
  -- one night a month or so ago, i woke up randomly at 4:00am. i heard footsteps going down the hallway, but didn't think much of it because i know my roommate stays up late. we were talking a few days later, and apparently he also woke up randomly at the same time and heard the footsteps too, even though all of us were in our beds and our other roommate was sleeping.
  
  -- again about a month ago, i was in my bedroom and my two roommates were in the hallway just talking. we all heard knocking. i assumed it was the front door, but it didn't sound like the front door sound (like that hard wood type of knock). my roommates were really confused and started searching around the kitchen and living room, and they were knocking on things to try to replicate the sound to see where it came from. apparently it was a knock on the kitchen radiator -- however, no one was in the kitchen, not even the cats.
  
  -- my roommate has been in the basement on several occasions and thought he saw shadows out of the corner of his eye, but nothing was there when he turned around. this has happened on numerous occasions.

   What walls do you seem to build up quicker than others? Physical, mentally, emotionally... spiritually?
  ","
  if anything, i build up emotional walls more than anything else. i'm very hesitant to talk and get to know new people because i don't know their intentions, and it's difficult for me to trust others.
  "
393246,"
   If you could give one piece of advice to the person you were ten years ago, what would you say...?
  ","
  i would tell my 18 year old self that things *do* get better in terms of my mental health, and that working towards my goals is the strongest way for me to reach a level of being content with my life. i would tell them that i would finally move out of my parents' house and start a new life for myself, a life in which i'm free from judgment and ab*se and can live according to my own terms.
  "
393247,"
   Who is your hero and why?
  ","
  chester bennington from the band linkin park. even though he d*ed three years ago, he still has a resounding influence on me in terms of his strength through adversity, his love for his fans and family, and his passion for his interests.
  
  when i was growing up as a teenager, linkin park's music was important to me and they essentially pushed me forward to see another day. i'll never be able to thank them enough for that.

  however, who i identify with the most is actually a video game character: chloe price, from the video game series ""life is strange."" i've always related to her personality, actions, etc etc., and felt a lot of empathy towards her during the game.

   How can you be happy without money?
  ","
  money is an important aspect to most people in terms of their happiness because it provides them with a sense of economic security, which is integral to really ""thrive"" in today's age.
  
  however, people can be happy without money if they have a strong support system, whether it's friends or family or their partner. cultivating interpersonal relationships is super important to an individual's happiness.

3. Boat party, gaming rooms, skylight neon party and sushi
  ","
  i love different aspects of all three of them, aahh !!

   How do you react when people assume they know what you want/think? Does it annoy you? Or make you laugh? Or...?
  ","
  i think it's amusing more than anything else, particularly when it's online such as on askfm. when we're conversing with people online or posting things online, you're only getting the side of people that they're comfortable showing to you. you're not getting the entire person. so in that vein, it's wrong to assume that you know how someone thinks and/or acts, because you only know what they're willing to tell you about them.
  "
393258,"
   What's something that can always make you feel better?
  ","
  iced coffee. lmaoo.
  
  even if i'm in a very depressed slump, the idea that i have iced coffee (or coffee in general) is sometimes enough to make myself get out of bed and start the day. it's a pretty strong motivator in my life.

  oof, this is a difficult question. we were together for 10 years, so i learned a lot while we were together.
  
  i think one of the most important things i learned is how to stand up for myself and speak my mind — he encouraged me to be honest and open communication with him regardless of how bad or angry i felt, and i slowly became more comfortable with expressing my feelings without having a fear of judgment or anger in return.

  i believe it's important to live with someone prior to getting married, because like you stated, you don't truly know your partner until you live with them & get to know their daily habits and *how* they live. you won't see a person's true character until you're around them routinely on a daily basis.

  yeah, i totally agree with you. i'm just concerned that the military is going to act the same as the police, i.e. ab*sing their power to exert unnecessary control over the protests and hurting people.

  idk, probably when i was a child. my mother has told me stories of when i was a child and wanted to ""be a boy"" and didn't want to do things girls typically were expected to do. that carried on into my teenage years, and eventually when i came out to my best friend 5+ years ago, she told me ""you're only figuring this out now? i've known since we were kids.""

  ","
  people have the freedom to make their money however they desire (assuming it's legal), and onlyfans is a resource that people use to accrue money in a legitimate manner. there's nothing wrong with offering adult services via subscription and making money as long as you pay your dues in taxes at the end of the year.

  no, hate is a very strong word and i've never hated him -- i probably could never hate him unless he does something absolutely horrible to purposely hurt me, which is unrealistic. i was definitely upset and a bit salty about the breakup at first, but we're still close friends so there's no animosity between us.

  -- if the rioting & looting outrages you more than the m*rder of a black man, then you're racist.
  
  -- abortion should be legalized globally and covered under all insurances regardless of circumstance.
  
  -- most forms of self-diagnosis is dangerous and invalidating to those struggling with those diagnosed disorders. i know it's considered a privilege to obtain professional help, but you shouldn't say ""i have x disorder"" after reading things online that resonate with you.
  
  -- nutella is disgusting, pineapple tastes good on pizza, chocolate-covered potato chips are an abomination, and french fries belong in vanilla ice cream.
  
  -- obesity is a medical condition, and when you're obese, you're at greater risk of developing other serious illnesses such as diabetes, rheumatologic, and skeletal disorders. it's fine to be body positive, but obesity is a health concern and you can't ignore medical facts just to look for clout online.

  ","
  (cont) ... One thing I'm concerned about is I don't even trust myself to not get attached. Even if he backs off and agrees nothing significant will ever come out of whatever we have, it's still natural for me to get overly attached and over think every moment. /: it makes me want to run
  
  --
  
  i understand the feeling all too well, i often get attached to people and then i end up getting hurt because they either do something or say something that isn't meant to be harmful, but because i'm so attached, it has so much more significance to me and my mind races with everything they say.
  
  perhaps through that distancing, your attachment won't happen. it's also good to be aware of when you are or aren't becoming attached, so the fact that you recognize that you're the type of person to attach themselves to someone is a good thing. it means you can prevent it when you see the signs happening.

  i think people like watching sad movies because it can be cathartic for them -- if they need to express emotion but don't know how, or they need to cry and can't bring themselves to cry, then sad movies provide that sort of release and comfort.
  
  scary movies are a bit similar, but i believe that's more to elicit an adrenaline rush and feeling of excitement more than anything else.

   Hey Leigh, idk if you remember but I asked for your advice on the guy I've been talking to online. Basically he wants to be with me and loves me but the feeling isn't really mutual, I'm just looking for a friend to pass the time for now. You advised me to distance myself (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... Instead of just cutting him off. Today he brought up wanting to be with me again and I told him he needs to not be so quick to be ruled by emotion and just be realistic. I don't want him to get hurt. I also brought up talking every few days instead of everyday and he didn't want to hear it at all. He was literally cutting me off and going blah blah blah lol. I just don't want to keep talking frequently and letting his feelings grow then letting him down. I asked him what he would do if down the road I started dating someone, and he said the thought makes him sad and why would I date someone when I have him? So now I'm not sure what to do. I told him us being together isn't going to happen and he said even if I say no, he won't give up so easily. So yeah, I really don't want to cut him off & I still enjoy talking to him but I'm not sure what to do. /:
  
  --
  
  oh man ... the fact that he says he wouldn't give up easily is really red flag-ish to me, honestly. he's not respecting your feelings, and it sounds like he genuinely believes he's going to win you over no matter what it takes (which can be alarming).
  
  i would be cautious. even if he doesn't want to stop talking as frequently, you have the option to not reply as frequently. you've already made yourself abundantly clear to him it seems, and he just won't accept no for an answer.
  
  if not replying as frequently doesn't work and he freaks out or threatens you in any way, that's when i'd cut him off completely. right now, he seems harmless but he's showing signs that he could be dangerous if not given what he wants. like i said, he obviously isn't taking no for an answer.
  
  please stay safe, friend. this guy is really giving me bad vibes.

  i think they can be useful for some people, although i've never read one myself.

   May i ask a personal question?
  ","
  sure, but depending on the question, i may or may not answer.
  "
393795,"
   was it physical or personality
  ","
  it's always been both.
  "
393796,"
   When was that?
  ","
  graduating from high school and moving onto college, returning home after my first year of college, graduating from college and pursuing an entry-level job, transitioning between jobs, breaking up with my ex, moving into a new home, etc etc.
  "
393797,"
   what made you feel attracted to a girl?
  ","
  ???
  
  it's ridiculous when people think that there are separate feelings for when someone is bi or gay compared to those who are straight. it's the same feeling.
  "
393798,"
   Have you ever experienced life transition and you felt lost?
  ","
  yes, this has happened to me on multiple occasions whenever life has transitioned for me.
  "
393799,"
   what made you think you were bi at 11?
  ","
  i was attracted to men and women, lol. my first relationship was with a girl, and then i dated a boy a few years later and the feelings were the same.
  "
393800,"
   i might get a mixed reaction from it it was a bit of a struggle for me at school alongside puberty
  ","
  i understand. i've known i was bisexual since i was 11 years old, but i wasn't out or anything until i was much older. i dated a girl when i was young, but we kept our relationship a secret from friends and family because we didn't know how they'd react.
  "
393801,"
   its just ive comeing to terms i'm bi sexual ive had this since i was 12 and its been a bit of an issue for me
  ","
  why do you think it's an issue? there's nothing wrong with being bisexual, but if you're concerned about backlash from friends or family, perhaps you should remain quiet about it until you feel safe. your safety is what matters most.
  "
393802,"
   pap a body pic of you?
  ","
  nah, no one needs to see that.
  "
393803,"
   how would you come out to someone
  ","
  honestly, i've always just slipped it into casual conversation. lmaoo.
  
  however, i've only ever come out to close friends IRL, and i also talk about it on the internet from time to time on social media, but it was never a direct declaration or anything.
  
  other people obviously do it differently, but it should be something you're comfortable doing when the time is right, in whichever way you think is best.
  "
393804,"
   What's the first thing you usually do when you get back home from a loooooong day? ??
  ","
  change into pajamas, take my medication, and scroll through social media on my phone.

  depends on what you need advice on, but i'll try my best.
  "
393806,"
   Well I think old age is good for you lol
  ","
  well, i'm definitely not old, lol.
  "
393807,"
   ok why do you think its disgusting to you?
  ","
  i can't explain it. i'm just unhappy with myself.
  "
393808,"
   why do you hate your face and body
  ","
  i just answered this.
  "
393809,"
   why?
  ","
  because it's disgusting to me, lol. my only redeeming qualities are my hair and eyes. i hate my face and body.
  "
393810,"
   are you body confident?
  ","
  nope, i absolutely hate my body.
  "
393811,"
   do you think a person needs dysphoria to be transgender? why or why not?
  ","
  i'm constantly undecided on this because i see both sides of the argument -- i can understand those who say trans people don't need dysphoria, because feminine-leaning and masculine-leaning non-binary or agender or genderfluid people exist, and they're content with their bodies. that doesn't invalidate their gender.
  
  at the same time, however, i believe a criteria in order for a trans person to be approved for top or bottom surgery is body dysphoria, although i'm not sure what the criteria is for HRT. i've never sought HRT or surgery, so i'm pretty uneducated in those areas.
  "
393812,"
   do you have  any hidden?
  ","
  most of them are pretty much hidden by regular clothes, yeah. i have tattoos on my upper arm, my forearm, my ribs, my back, my upper thigh, my calf, and my ankle.
  "
393813,"
   Do you have tattoo?
  ","
  yes, i have seven tattoos.
  "
393814,"
   what makes you blush?
  ","
  i don't really blush, so i'm not entirely sure.
  "
393815,"
   Would you rather be a teenager or a child again?
  ","
  is ""neither"" an option? lmaoo.
  
  i don't remember my childhood, so who knows what happened back then. my teenage years were terrible. i'm content with being an adult.
  "
393816,"
   Do you get annoyed when people expect you to be ok with something that they wouldn't be ok with if it was done to them?? ??
  ","
  yeah, i'm sure everyone would be annoyed by that. that's why i've cut a few people out of my life in recent years -- they were simply unfair in that manner, and they wouldn't acknowledge that their behavior was hypocritical.
  "
393817,"
   The grocery shelves will soon be stocked with seasonal specialty items. What is your favorite pumpkin spice food-item?
  ","
  pumpkin pie and pumpkin bread will always be my favorites.
  "
393818,"

  ","
  playing video games makes me lose track of time, haha. three hours could pass and i'd have no idea.
  "
393819,"
   Is archery boring?
  ","
  it seems pretty fun, but i just got frustrated quickly because i couldn't line it up correctly.
  "
393820,"
   Was it a real thing or a toy?
  ","
  it was real -- i was in upstate new york staying at a dude ranch and they offered archery.
  "
393821,"
   do you prefer someone giving you money or gifts?
  ","
  doesn't much matter to me, i appreciate it either way.
  "
393822,"
   Are you good at shooting an arrow in middle of the target?
  ","
  nope, i've only tried archery once and i was terrible at it.
  "
393823,"
   Are you good at buying gifts?
  ","
  yeah, i'd say so. i usually like getting people sentimental and custom gifts off of etsy.
  "
393824,"
   Ever been on a speed boat?
  ","
  i don't believe i have, no. i've been on regular like 10-person boats with friends as well as a cruise ship.
  "
393825,"
   why?
  ","
  there's nothing to argue about. my friends and i have all found common ground and confide in each other with our troubles, and there's never any conflict.
  "
393826,"
   Are you the first to make up with someone?
  ","
  for the most part, yeah. however, i haven't had an argument with a friend in an extremely long time.
  "
393827,"
   Name some teas you like. ?
(That is, if you like tea.)
  ","
  peppermint tea, blueberry white tea, earl grey tea, matcha tea, jasmine tea, and ginger peach tea.
  "
393828,"
   Who makes you feel safe?
  ","
  depends on the day. when i'm feeling unsafe, i'll confide in one of my close friends and they usually help me in feeling more secure.
  "
393829,"
   Do you think couples should love each other equally?
  ","
  i think everyone has a different definition of what love is, but i also do believe that people in relationships should have a common ground or understanding of what love means to them specifically in order for things to work.
  "
393830,"
   What are you most proud of? ❣️
  ","
  taking the first step forward my treatment for mental illness and following through with finding a doctor and a therapist to help me.
  "
393831,"
   How are you feeling after crying? Do you know why you cried?
  ","
  yeah, there was a trigger to my episode. but i feel fine now, i'm just listening to music to ease myself down and settle myself down so i can sleep soon.
  "
393832,"
   Did this pandemic made you spend more or less money?
  ","
  less money -- i'm making coffee and breakfast at home instead of buying it on the way to work, and i'm spending less money on gas for my car every week since i've been working from home.
  "
393833,"
   Hi, how was/is your day?
  ","
  hello ~~
  
  my day was fine. i worked for 8.5 hours, then laid down with the cats and checked social media. i heated up a quick dinner, and now i've been watching forensic files and having a few hard seltzers in the meantime.
  
  i had a mini mental breakdown that lasted like ... 10 minutes, and i was crying profusely, but now i feel fine, so.
  "
393834,"
   What are some red flags to watch out for in daily life?
  ","
  i've always been under the belief that we should trust our gut instincts. if you have a bad feeling about someone or something, then follow that feeling and take a different route. often times, ignoring that instinct will result in complicated or harmful situations.
  "
393835,"
   How important do you think self-improvement is?
  ","
  self-improvement will always be important, because you cannot grow as a human being if you don't continually try to improve yourself in some way.
  "
393836,"
   What video games genre do you like?
  ","
  open world RPGs mostly. i also like a few first person shooters, like destiny and halo.
  "
393837,"
   Do you share your food?
  ","
  not off of the same plate or anything, but yeah. if my roommate and i are cooking, obviously we make our own plates and whatnot. whatever is left over in the pot, we throw in the fridge for whoever wants to eat it next.

  "
393840,"
   What’s something that everyone knows is true, but we don’t like to admit it?
  ","
  white privilege is very much a real thing, and even though there are so many people trying to raise awareness of that & the injustices people of color face, there are just as many -- if not more -- people who claim white privilege doesn't exist.
  "
393841,"
   What product or service is way more expensive than it needs to be?
  ","
  things like pads and tampons, they're ridiculously overpriced. but people have no choice but to buy them in most cases, and it leads a lot of others to be at risk of infection or ill health if they can't afford them.
  "
393842,"

  "
393847,"
   If you had a fall out with a friend will you tell their secrets?
  ","
  absolutely not. just because i'm not friends with them anymore doesn't mean it's acceptable to reveal their secrets that they confided in me in confidence.

  ","
  no, i seldom request people on facebook.

  ","
  no, i'm happy for my friends who are in great relationships.
  "
393853,"
   What's the difference between a 'functioning' alcoholic and a regular alcoholic in your opinion?
  ","
  i believe high-functioning alcoholics are alcoholics who are perhaps in denial about their problem because they can still do their ordinary tasks without an issue. they don't see their alcohol intake as an issue and don't believe they require rehab or any sort of treatment for their addiction.
  
  this doesn't make their alcoholism any less severe or important, though. any sort of alcoholism is lethal and detrimental to not only the well being of the user, but also their friends and family.
  "

  they're not a problem, they're just habits. i drink occasionally and vape every day, lol.
  "
393878,"
   What life lesson did you learn the hard way?
  ","
  do not give more of yourself to a person who isn't reciprocating the same efforts and energy. there will be people in your life who will end up taking advantage of the friendship, and it's unhealthy and toxic for you to continually put effort into maintaining the friendship when you're not receiving the same energy back. one-sided friendships are unhealthy.
  "
393879,"
   Do you think that humans will ever be able to live together in harmony?

  ","
  you're not the suspicious one at all, honestly. the number of photos someone sends another person shouldn't be an indication of how real they are or how interested they are. he should really be understanding of your insecurities, and like i said, if he has a problem with that then that's something he has to deal with himself.

  i can't think of one day in particular, but pretty much any night that i've spent with friends and we're all sitting around a campfire, drinking, eat delicious food, and swapping stories.
  
  there was one night in particular that i was at a friend's house, and there were maybe 7 other people over. we all sat in a circle around the campfire, and it was someone's birthday so we passed around a tray of tequila shots with salt and lime slices in order to celebrate. it was a lot of fun.

   How ridiculous. White people cry about being “oppressed” just because people are just bringing more awareness to racism and white privilege. White people don’t have a single idea how it is like being POC. your life can be hard, but your life is not hard because of your skin colour.
  ","
  yes, this is exactly it -- people aren't discounting white people's hardships when it comes to other aspects of their lives, but their difficulties do *not* stem from their skin color by any means.
  
  people of color, on the other hand, are oppressed and discriminated against solely because of their race, and that's something multi-generational and rooted in historical racism (and even internalized racism).
  
  i'm white so i'll never be able to understand the troubles people of color face, and i've benefited from white privilege my entire life, but i often try to use my privilege as a platform to allow people of color to speak for themselves.

  when i was 19 years old, my friends and i took a joyride to a place called ""sweet hollow road"" on long island, which has supposedly been haunted for ages. it's a long, winding road with no lights and people have said to have had a lot of weird experiences there.
  
  we were drinking and we were underage, and when we pulled off to the side for the boys to pee, we were approached by a cop car. my ex lied to them and said he was the only one drinking, even though *everyone* was drinking including the driver, and somehow my ex and the driver sweet-talked their way out of us getting in trouble for underage drinking and urinating in public. at one point, they searched the trunk of the car and found some weird items, including a ghillie suit (which my friend used when he worked at an amusement/haunted park). as well as a pair of night vision goggles.

  ","
  i don't really think people should be worried about not offending others in general, because when you think too much into how people think of you, it can change your opinion of yourself.
  
  what you do and say, meaning the things that make you happy and want to fulfill your own life, is your decision. it's out of your control whether or not people get offended by your choices or actions, and that isn't necessarily your responsibility.

  there's still a large stigma surrounding men who are interested in ""feminine"" things, and those men are stigmatized and classified as being gay or weak in light of those interests. it's completely wrong, and no one is weak for liking things that go against the societal norm of what a person ""should"" be interested in by societal standards. additionally, a person's interests in concepts or objects has no bearing on their sexual orientation.

   Hi again, idk if you remember but I think I sent an anon asking for advice about me talking with this guy for about 2/3 weeks online. I don't remember the specifics, sorry lol. Buuut there's one more thing I would appreciate your input on if you don't mind! (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... So basically, the guy told me that he loves me. But the feeling isn't really mutual, even though I do like him and have grown an attachment. In the past, I was in this cycle of forming relationships with men online, growing extremely unhealthily attached to the point of splitting on them constantly and just developing a very toxic relationship. This has happened so many times that I promised myself I would get professional help and get my life together before even thinking about love, and never do the long distance thing cuz it isn't for me. After several months of being successful, here I am again in this situation. I've become attached to this guy but I don't quite love him, i'm too conflicted on my feelings and here he is telling me he loves me. I was honest about how I feel and he said he wasn't going to push it. However, I just feel like someone will get hurt. He lives in a whole other country and like I said, I don't think this will ever progress into anything other than chatting online. Still, I'm super attached now and it'd be hard to just cut him off. What would you do? Sorry for how long this is. Thx
  
  --
  
  that's a rough situation to be in, and i'm sorry you're going through this -- especially since it seems to be rather confusing for both yourself and the other person.
  
  i don't know if i would cut him off entirely, but it might be beneficial for you to try to distance yourself from him. perhaps, instead of talking to him every day, you talk to him every few days. allow yourself the space to collect your thoughts and feelings, and also indicate to him again that you don't reciprocate those feelings of love.
  
  i understand the whole attachment thing, because i often feel the same way about people in my life. i get overly attached to certain people in rounds, almost, i.e. i'll become extremely attached to one person and then they do something wrong, and then i'll attach myself to someone else in the meantime. i've had too many ""favorite people"" to keep track of at this point.
  
  however, i do recommend distancing if you're attached and you don't believe you can cut him off entirely, and i also don't think cutting him off entirely is something that's necessary anyway. just enough so that he understands you don't feel the same way towards him and perhaps allow yourself the chance to ease yourself out of that attachment stage.

  "
394113,"
   What has been the most valuable lesson you've ever learnt in life?
  ","
  don't put more effort into a relationship (whether platonic or romantic) than what it's worth -- especially if the other person isn't contributing to their half of the relationship as well. a lot of people hurt themselves because they invest so much time and energy into relationships that are one-sided.
  
  i've learned that no relationship is worth pursuing or maintaining if the other person isn't doing their fair share. relationships go both ways, and it's unfair to you if you're putting so much of yourself emotionally into something that isn't being reciprocated.

  when i'm depressed, i don't do any type of basic care. i seldom eat, only get out of bed to use the bathroom, i don't shower, etc etc.
  
  it's difficult. but sometimes it's easier to go little by little and try to convince yourself that you'll feel a bit better if you washed your hair that day, for example. or even brushing it can go a long way. using dry shampoo to get the grease out. using wipes to bathe yourself if you can't bring yourself to shower.

  if they seem racist when only they're angry, then they're overall racist -- when they're angry, they're showing their true colors, which is racism. the reason why they don't appear racist when they're calm is because they don't want people knowing that they're racist.

  ","
  racism is a result, or rather a ""symptom"", of a unstable political system which favors middle aged white men over other minority groups. the fight against racism has always been part of civil rights movements, so in that vein, it can be classified as a political entity.

  if someone is racist and cannot see the wrong in their behavior, then not much can be done until they realize it themselves. a person won't be willing to change unless they recognize it within themselves and actively seeks to change themselves.
  
  honestly, if you've talked to him multiple times about this and he hasn't changed, then he's not going to see it from another perspective. you should consider breaking up with him if he's racist.

   When you're around your friends, or talking with them. Would you say you're more of the caring, motherly, protective one. Or more of the one who looks for guidance from the others?
  ","
  i more often give advice than look for advice, but i wouldn't really consider myself motherly or protective. i know that people will make their decisions regardless of what is told to them, and some people will take that advice into account and some won't, but it's ultimately their decision and it's no use trying to protect them from their own mistakes.
  
  people will make mistakes, and will often learn from those mistakes. sometimes we have to make mistakes in order to move forward. i'm not going to sit here and try to protect my friends from those mistakes, but i'll give them my input and then they can decide whether or not they will take it.

  example ; i was tipsy and playing GTA V with my ex and our friends, and we entered a helicopter. we play on xbox one. to enter and exit vehicles, you have to press Y. so while we're like ... 100 feet in the air, my friend tells me, ""hey leigh, you can mount your gun if you press Y."" so i go, ""OH, okay!"" i press Y and my character jumps right out of the helicopter and fall to their death. lmaoo.

  lol, yes that has happened to me on a few occasions, particularly in recent times considering i drink most nights out of the week at this point.

   Are you the type of person who judges someone based upon their zodiac sign, or do you actually get to know them?

  i don't place much faith in zodiac signs, because someone's personality is dependent upon their environment, how they grew up, their interests, etc etc. it doesn't necessarily correlate with their zodiac sign, so to judge someone based on what sign they are is ignorant, in my opinion.
  "
394335,"

  ","
  my parents are vastly different people, and i'm more similar to my father than anything else. we're both hard working, logical (to a point), and look at situations from multiple perspectives before making a decision.
  
  my mother, on the other hand, is narcissistic, selfish, and impulsive. she doesn't think before she speaks or acts, which has often led to hurt feelings. she never admits when she's wrong and she only sees things from her own perspective.
  "
394336,"
   How do you know you’re in love not just crushing?
  ","
  this is similar to my previous response, so please refer to that answer for what being *in* love with someone can encompass.
  
  having a crush on someone doesn't mean that you love them or even in love with them. it's just an infatuation with a person with feelings that may not necessarily be very strong.
  "
394337,"
   What’s the difference between being in love and loving someone?
  ","
  you can love someone without being *in* love with them -- and it isn't necessarily romantic. you can love your friends, your family, your colleagues, your pets, etc etc.
  
  being *in* love with someone, on the other hand, normally happens when you're with a partner and the feelings of love you have are unlike anything else. it's different for everyone, but you'll feel a distinct difference between simply loving someone and then being in love with someone.

  for a quick and easy protein-packed breakfast, instead of cooking eggs on the stove, you can crack two eggs into a mug with a splash of milk and some salt, and then microwave for 90 seconds.

   ""Cheating is just part of the ups and downs of a relationship"" - do you agree or disagree with this statement?

  i highly disagree.
  
  ups & downs of relationships include stuff like getting into arguments, enduring hardship together, etc etc. cheating is a *choice* -- and in the majority of situations, there's absolutely no excuse for it at all.
  
  if your partner is cheating on you, then there's no reason for you to stay together (in most circumstances, although i known some have differing opinions). everyone deserves the respect of loyalty, and if your partner doesn't respect you, the relationship is built on nothing.

  i believe regardless of gender, a person may be attracted to someone who's expressed that they've experienced hardship because they have a caring nature and want to help them. some people also seem to go a little further and want to ""save"" them, which can be a borderline toxic situation. on the other hand, some others are just naturally drawn to people who have had significant hardship on an innate level, because they can understand them in a unique way.

   Hardest part of BPD for you?
  ","
  it's hard to distinguish just one thing because everything sorta blends into each other to create this chaotic mess, honestly. between the mood swings and paranoia, the deep depressions and mania, and the unhealthy coping mechanisms and obsessive attachments ... it all becomes hard to deal with because they're all happening at the same time.

   Thank you! Yeah I just don’t know whether to say I want to break off the relationship or just let it “fade” away. Because people have said not to burn bridges. But since we are still like asking “how are you” (this is just an obligation I think)it’s not likely this friendship is going to just fade
  ","
  you're not really burning a bridge by letting the friendship fade, though. when i think of burning bridges, it's more of a feeling of animosity towards the other person, like if you two were to get into an argument or something and end the friendship in that manner. by letting the friendship go, there aren't really any ""hard feelings"" involved, it's just the natural progression of the friendship, or lack thereof.
  
  however, you should do what you think is best. if you think that it would be more beneficial to the two of you if you had that conversation, then perhaps do that instead. i would just be afraid that it would lead to bad blood, but those are my own insecurities, haha.

  at this point in my life, no. it's damaging to regret things that you cannot change, and you cannot move forward with your life if you keep holding onto regrets from the past. the only thing we can do is accept them for what they are and continue progressing forward, learning the lessons we were taught from the mistake and using those lessons to better ourselves.
  "
394568,"
   (1)Do you think it is best to break off a friendship with someone you have drifted apart with? My friend and I are on good terms, but i feel like she doesn’t put in effort into the friendship anymore. We meet every 4 months but we run out of things to say. I feel awkward with her, and we never text
  ","
  (cont) ... we text like every one or two months but we are usually just asking “how are you?” She also takes days to reply me and on one occasion months. I must admit I don’t feel like we both are giving any more effort into this. I communicated to her about this already, but things are not improving. I don’t want to invest in this friendship anymore, I tried many times to make it work and I don’t want to try anymore.The both of us have changed too much and that’s okay. I just don’t know how I should deal with this. We used to be best friends but I know we don’t feel this way anymore. Advice?
  
  --
  
  if you feel that it is best to end the friendship, then there's nothing wrong with doing so. it's natural for people to drift apart as they've gotten older, lose interest in the same things, and end up taking different paths in life. it's just a fact of life, and it's hard to swallow, but it's normal for stuff like this to happen.
  
  sometimes it's best to just allow the friendship to fade away, since that is how it appears it's going anyway (based on what you told me, at least). stop trying to put effort into maintaining it, especially if you guys have talked about it already and nothing has changed. friendships should be worked on at both ends, not just one, and it's unfair to you to keep working on keeping the friendship alive when she doesn't do the same.

  i don't really think it's homophobic, but i do think it's kinda infringing on the lgbtq+ community.
  
  however, i totally understand why you would do such a thing. most people don't take ""no"" for an answer, which sucks a lot, and it's easier to make yourself inherently unavailable to that person instead of refusing their advances, since an lot of people (mainly men) don't really care if you say no.

  "
394651,"
   Where should we draw the line between talking honestly about mental illness.... and romanticising it? Where is the difference?
  ","
  discussing mental illness includes conversation about the reality of living with mental illness, including all of the negative attributes and disruptive symptoms that come alongside it.
  
  romanticizing mental illness, on the other hand, often paints a picture that makes someone with mental illness seem more desirable or beautiful or tragic in a poetic way, solely because they have mental illness. it isn't an educated discussion, it's veiling the topic of mental health with metaphors that don't quite reflect the difficulties people have.
  "

  "
394658,"
   What do you think of the women who call men trash or generalize them in other ways?
  ","
  usually when people refer to *all* men are trash, they're projecting their hurt onto the population of men (usually cis men, tbh) as a whole because they've had nothing but bad experiences with them -- this can include all sorts of ab*se, assault, and/or neglect.
  
  while i don't personally believe that all men are bad, i do sympathize with people who view men in that way because it's obvious they've been hurt greatly and it's tainted their view of men in general.

  quite the contrary, actually. it really has no effect on someone's hygiene, which is why men aren't being told its not hygienic because they're not expected to shave their underarms. it's simply another classic misogynistic view against women.

   Do you have any of those really needy friends who are using this pandemic as an excuse to project their abandonment and insecurity issues with passive aggressive social media posts like - 'After the lockdown is over remember which friends, called you, texted you, checked you're ok' etc, etc ???
  ","
  i don't have any friends personally who have posted such things, but i do see it sometimes on my facebook feed.
  
  i disagree with the notion of the post in general. this pandemic has left people either incredibly bored or incredibly busy, and nearly everyone is emotionally exhausted and feeling the detrimental effects of this pandemic. some people don't have the mental energy to check in with others, and that's perfectly okay. you don't need to prove your friendship to other people by checking in on them all the time, especially during trying times like these.

  ","
  i seldom shaved my legs and armpits even prior to quarantine, lmaoo.
  
  there was no reason for it -- i'm covered up in the winter, so it's not as if people would see it anyway. plus, body hair is nothing to be ashamed of.

  there was a period of my life where i refused to sleep in my bedroom, and instead, i would sleep on the living room floor in a sleeping bag or beneath the dining room table.

  people can be exposed -- through dead strains once a vaccine is produced. otherwise, it's entirely unsafe and irresponsible to continue going out, seeing friends and family, etc etc., knowing you could be a carrier and put them at risk as well as yourself at risk.
  
  hospitals are overflowing where i live. we have among the worst number of cases of any state because people live in such close quarters to one another and it's easy for the disease to spread. obviously i don't want this to happen either, but it's the truth of the matter.

   Staying inside and hiding from disease will just kill you faster. The only people who should be hiding, if they choose, is unbealthy/obese and elderly people. In order to build up immunity to disease you need to be exposed to it which is vvvery basic biology.
  ","
  marissa, this is a new disease which means that no one is immune to it. the fact that people have been under lock down and numbers are decreasing is showing that quarantining has been helpful.
  
  the coronavirus doesn't only attack immunocompromised and the elderly, as what we previously thought. people who are also relatively healthy have been catching the disease as well, and that's in part due to the fact that when one person carries it, they could spread it to more people -- and then those people can spread it to even more people afterwards.
  
  it is basic biology to state that we do become more immune to certain things after exposure, but we've never been exposed to this before because it's an entirely new strain of something we've never seen. the only way for things to get better is if people stay social distancing from one another, use protective gear, and only go out when necessary.

  i don't think i would be suspicious as much as i would be concerned. he could have very well been in an ab*sive relationship and doesn't want to reflect back on that time.
  
  when he's ready to tell you, maybe he will. or maybe he won't and believes that the past is in the past for a reason. either way, what's important is the ""now"" and how you two spend time together and communicate. in all truth, past relationships shouldn't affect your current relationship.

  i disagree -- i believe that gender is a spectrum, and while there are two sexes (excluding intersex people obviously), gender exists in a spectrum similar to how sexual orientation exists on a spectrum. there are trans men and trans women, but also non-binary, genderfluid, and agender folks as well.
  
  being transgender is also not a mental illness, and trans identities were removed from the DSM and ICD i believe a few years ago. it isn't recognized as a mental illness anymore.
  
  as for the other part of her answer, i'm still unsure of my stance as to whether or not trans people *need* dysphoria to be trans. everyone has their own views on their identities, but i believe dysphoria is a large component of being trans (as least in my personal experience). i would have top surgery if i could.

  if you're questioning whether or not it's weird in the first place, then perhaps it *is* weird. it also depends on what your ex's sister would think of the situation as well.

  you asked me this last night, and yesterday was an ""all right"" day overall. i spent most of the day working, and work was absolutely ridiculous with how busy things were with a lot of last-minute items and changes. it stressed me out a little bit.
  
  after work, i cleaned the house, which took my mind off of things, and then i pretty much spent the evening listening to music and browsing social media on my laptop. i fell asleep fairly early (around 10:30 or 11:00pm).

  lol, you already know about my experience with edibles the first and only time i tried them. :'))
  
  i was around 15 or 16 years old when i tried edibles, and back then, it wasn't something you can easily buy from a reputable person or corporation, especially in new york. me and a group of friends tried making them ourselves, and i ended up having an entire brownie -- which likely wasn't the best thing for me to do, considering i had little experience with marijuana at the time and it was a big dose.
  
  i essentially blacked out, LOL. i remember bits and pieces, such as being in the backseat of my friend's car and watching all of the street lights zoom past with the different colors, and then we ended up at one of my friend's boyfriend's apartment somewhere out of town. i don't remember anything other than that, though.

   If a boy adds you as a friend on Facebook because you are beautiful, he will not contact you in real life, just browse your photos and read the text you write, will you accept his friend request?

  i've met the members of the band linkin park when i was a teenager, which was a dream come true for me. i'm not sure if these people are considered ""famous"" or not, but they are in the video game and internet wise -- i've met barbara dunkelman from rooster teeth productions as well as griffin ramsey, who used to be in rooster teeth and is now a well known wood carver.

  "
394869,"
   ? If you were to draw or paint something that would eventually become well loved, what would your piece of art look like? :D
  ","
  i've had a long history of showcasing artistic works when i was a teenager, and although i've dropped off a lot in terms of art, i believe that a mixed media work would suit me best. i like working with pastels, watercolor, charcoal, and ink the most, and the subject matter would revolve around mental health, stigma, and my innermost feelings.
  "
394870,"
   10. What should doctors do to better support people with mental health issues and/or disabilities?
  ","
  more physicians, psychologists, and psychiatrists should take their time in listening to their patients' concerns and display of symptoms instead of writing them off with a simple prescription and sending them along. there are a lot of doctors who see so many patients that they only allocate 15-20 minutes for each appointment, which definitely isn't enough time to really get a full scope of how a person is experiencing a mental illness.
  "
394871,"
   9. Should people be self medicating to manage their symptoms?
  ","
  self-medication is normally advised against by medical professionals, but i do know some people who do manage their symptoms of either mental or physical illnesses through supplements or marijuana.
  
  it's always best to obtain a professional opinion, of course, but if someone is going down the dark road of turning to drugs and alcohol as self-management, then that's extremely unhealthy and can lead to further deterioration of their ailments.
  "
394872,"
   8.Is self-diagnosing mental health issues the wrong thing to do?
  ","
  i believe it's acceptable to self-diagnose simply cases of depression or anxiety because those signs are easy to tell, and a simple general practitioner can diagnose those issues right away and refer a patient to a specialist.
  
  however, when it comes to more complex disorders (i.e. personality disorders), it's wrong to self-diagnose and claim that you have a certain disorder when you haven't been professionally diagnosed with that disorder. many symptoms of mental illnesses are co-morbid, so your own interpretation of your illness may be entirely different from what a professional can ascertain after a psychological evaluation.
  "
394873,"
   7. Is it inappropriate to assume that someone is or isn't disabled?
  ","
  yes, it's extremely inappropriate to assume whether or not a person is disabled. it's also inappropriate to judge someone based on the status of their disability -- people are human regardless of their ability or disability, and to discriminate against someone because of their health is ableism.
  "
394874,"
   6. Are there any disabilities or mental health issues that you would like to understand better?
  ","
  i'm always open to learning more about both physical and mental disabilities, particularly with an emphasis on such mental illnesses as personality disorders, psychotic disorders, and dissociative disorders.
  "
394875,"
   5. Do you know anyone who is disabled? How do you support them?
  ","
  i know a few people who are disabled, on both a physical aspect as well as mental aspect. i know people who are on disability benefits for both mental and physical illnesses, and i spent a good two years of my life working at a law firm where i directly advocated for the equal treatment of those who are disabled.
  "
394876,"
   4. Are mental health problems and disabilities linked?
  ","
  mental illness can be a disability, so yes. there are physical disabilities and mental disabilities, so there's really no separation between mental illness and disability since mental disabilities are just as debilitating as physical disabilities.
  "
394877,"
   3. Should people with mental health problems be treated the same as those who have physical ones?
  ","
  without a doubt, yes. there are still so many people who believe that mental health is not as severe or important as physical health -- but what those people do not know is that mental health often manifests itself in physical symptoms as well. mental health is just as physical as other physical ailments.
  "
394878,"
   2. How do you look after your mental well-being?
  ","
  i struggle with several mental illnesses, so my main source of treatment is through psychiatric medication. i also attended intensive therapy for three years on a weekly basis until my therapist quit her job.
  
  now that i don't have therapy, i've been relying on my friends more often for support and reaching out to others when i'm not feeling mentally well.
  "
394879,"
   1. Is there a stigma around mental health?
  ","
  yes, there's an immense stigma still surrounding mental health. the stigma has been lifted somewhat in recent years due to increased advocacy and awareness of illnesses, but there are still a significant number of people who hold close-minded views regarding mental illness, whether out of willful ignorance or being uneducated.
  
  it's detrimental to mental health as a whole -- we *all* have mental health, and millions of people struggle with mental illness. it's something we all need to talk about.

   What little things that you like when you were in a relationship?
  ","
  the look of love & admiration on the person's face when they're looking at you; receiving texts of love and appreciation at random moments during the day or week; small gestures of affection when i'm feeling particularly down; emotional intimacy and having the feeling that i'm innately understood; and cuddling with someone with whom you feel safe.
  "
394885,"
   I have really bad trust issues people say that's a bad thing to have do you agree?
  ","
  having trust issues is generally bad, but i also have severe trust issues as well. however, it's something you have to resolve within yourself and with the support of people close to you -- you can't go from not trusting others to trusting people in the snap of a finger, and it's also just as bad to be *too* trusting of others as well.
  "
394886,"
   Do you think opposite genders can maintain a friendship without developing a love interest?
  ","
  there's really no such thing as an ""opposite"" gender because more than two genders exist. regardless, people can certainly maintain friendships with people outside of their own gender or sex, regardless of their sexual orientation.

   How shy students can be helped take part in the speaking activities?

  i'm just as mature as other people in my age group.
  "

  if i said that i've been in love twice before, then it's probably because i realized that the ""love"" i thought i felt wasn't being in love at all.

   20. Are you an introvert or an extrovert?
  ","
  i'm mainly an introvert, but i have extroverted tendencies. being around groups of people mentally and physically drains me. however, at the same time, i'm also energized when i'm around small groups of maybe 2-3 people, particularly close friends.

  "
394951,"
   17.What is your natural hair colour?
  ","
  my natural hair color is a dirty blonde/light brown -- almost like a mousy brown. you can see it somewhat in my current profile picture because the side of my head that's normally shaved has grown out quite a lot.
  "
394952,"
   do you answer if I write you a message?

  ","
  when i was commuting to work in the morning, it would normally take me 15 minutes or so in order to get dressed, freshen up in the bathroom, pack my lunch, and take my medication.
  
  however, now that i've been working from home, i literally roll out of bed, turn on my computer, make a pot of coffee, and sit down to work. lmaoo. it takes maybe 5 minutes in total.
  "
394957,"

  i haven't watched the olympics in a while, but i used to enjoy the ice skating competitions and gymnastics.
  "
394966,"
   5. What do you think of the olympics being cancelled?
  ","
  on a historical level, i think it's disappointing because the olympics is something that has existed for over a century. at the same time, however, i believe it's necessary to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
  "
394967,"
   8. Are you a member of any sports teams?
  ","
  lol, no.
  
  fun fact ; i used to play on an adult volleyball team sponsored by the catholic church when i was in my early 20s. it only lasted one summer, but it was pretty fun.

   11. Do you go out jogging?
  ","
  when i lived at my parents' house and it was mild weather, i would walk and job around the block a few times per week. once this pandemic slows down and things get back to a level of normalcy, i'd like to start doing that again.
  "
394970,"
   12. Would you consider running a marathon?
  ","
  definitely not, LOL. i have absolutely zero stamina for something of that caliber.
  "
394971,"
   13. Do you like to exercise?
  ","
  it's funny (and probably fairly common), but the idea of exercising is daunting to me and it's one of the reasons why i haven't started it back up again. however, i've also noticed that once i get into an exercise routine, i actually do enjoy it and feel proud of myself for doing it.
  "
394972,"
   15. Are there any sports that you watch on TV?
  ","
  no, i'm not a fan of sports in general. the only sport that i have a slight interest in is ice hockey.

  "
394975,"
   19. Do you think that sports stars get paid too much money? Why? Why not?
  ","
  yeah, sports stars definitely are paid too much money for what they do. i understand that they're talented and sports is a source of entertainment for millions of people, but i believe that people such as health care workers and scientists should be seeing the same level of pay because they're contributing to the betterment of humanity and society every day.
  "
394976,"
   20. What is the main sport that is played in your country?
  ","
  in the united states, the biggest sports are football and baseball, closely followed by basketball and hockey.
  "
394977,"
   What are some things that are a comfort and getting you through this current pandemic? What are your coping methods when it's all getting a bit too much?
  ","
  work, video games, and re-watching old television shows that i used to love are definitely comforting to me through this entire pandemic. they allow me to escape reality for just a little while and they give me something to occupy my time.
  
  i have fairly unhealthy coping mechanisms, which includes drinking and vaping, but i've also been trying to reach out to friends more often when i'm not doing well.
  "
394978,"
   Have you seen any studio ghibli films? If so, what are your favourites? If not, what's your favourite movies in general?
  ","
  i've only seen howl's moving castle, spirited away, and kiki's delivery service. however, all of those movies are absolutely beautiful and spirited away is my favorite of the three.
  "
394979,"
   Say in the future, robots make up most of the workforce and basically everyone's needs is taken care of so people don't have to work, would you miss working or simply enjoy the freedom? ?‍♀️?‍⚕️??Why? ?
  ","
  i would miss working, i'm not going to lie. having a steady routine every day, which includes work, is what keeps me somewhat stable -- and i would probably descend into a deep depression if i didn't have something like a job to occupy my time.
  "
394980,"
   Do you work in order to live, or do you live to work? Is your job your ideal job or is it something to pay the bills? If you don't work, is your partner or parents happy in their line of work or is it just something that keeps you all fed and living?
  ","
  for me, it's a little bit of both -- i enjoy my job, but i also take my job seriously because it's the means by which i can afford my life and pay my bills. it isn't my *ideal* job, but my job is definitely something i can see myself doing for quite a few years from now. i feel fortunate to have found a workplace that not only allows me to express my creativity, but allows me to be responsible and have a sense of fulfillment at the end of the day.
  "
394981,"
   What makes you angry about your country? Your state/county? What about your home town?
  ","
  i'm angry at the justice system in the united states, which often blames and punishes victims of crimes while letting the actual criminals off with less time (or even no time) than they deserve. there's more pressure and discrimination against people of color in the united states when it comes to arrests by law enforcement, and racial bias is still very strong.
  
  as for the state of new york, i'm angry that the board of elections canceled the presidential democratic primary elections that was supposed to happen in late june. we can't even do mail-in ballots.
  "
394982,"
   If you had to pick a pet, based off your personality. Which animal would you choose (can be animals which aren't typically domesticated)
  ","
  if we're going personality-wise, i'd probably choose a sloth. lmaoo. they're also incredibly adorable creatures.
  
  however, i've also always wanted an axolotl. they're such interesting animals.
  "
394983,"
   Are you afraid of making mistakes? Or are you afraid of the effects of those mistakes?
  ","
  i'm not afraid of the mistake itself, but i'm afraid of the consequences of those mistakes, whether the consequences are from a higher-up in a professional sense or my own expectations.
  
  mistakes are human. we all make mistakes, and most can be forgiven. however, i have such a high expectation of myself that when i do make a mistake, i beat myself up for it.
  "
394984,"
   Do you feel you were born at the right time? Do your ideas fit into today's society? What. About your clothing style and so on?
  ","
  i feel as if i was born in the right era, yeah. when i was younger (teenage ages) and more naive, i was always that type of person to say, ""i'm an old soul -- i was born in the wrong decade!"" until i realized how silly that sounded.
  
  if anything, my clothing style is casual and it most resembles 1990s grunge. but i grew up in the 1990s, so it still fits.
  "
394985,"
   Do you think you'd enjoy living in a tiny home?
  ","
  very much so !! i have no desire to live in a huge home or mansion or anything extravagant. as long as there's enough room for me, my partner, and some pets, that's good enough for me.
  "
394986,"
   When you're on youtube, what kind of videos do you usually watch? ?
  ","
  i normally use youtube to listen to music while i'm working, which is normally classical music or video game/movie/television soundtracks.
  
  i also watch achievement hunter and rooster teeth videos, and occasionally markiplier, because i like gaming videos. i also enjoy buzzfeed unsolved.

  -- not being afraid to call me out on my behavior if i'm being irrational or problematic.
  
  -- taking time to get to know my friends and actually be friendly with them.
  
  -- reassuring me and comforting me when i'm having a particularly bad mental health day.
  "
395003,"
   Do you agree with the term ""something is only a problem if you make it one""
  ","
  no, i disagree. a problem can still be a problem even if someone doesn't make it out to be a problem at all, and that normally happens in cases when people are ignorant, afraid, or insecure. just because they don't emphasize that it's a problem to them doesn't erase the fact that it's problematic.
  "
395004,"
   What's some stereotypes about where you live? Do you find any of them to be true? If you don't feel comfortable sharing... What's some stereotypes about somewhere you've traveled to?
  ","
  i live on long island and the stereotypes are often that we're rude and entitled, are incredibly wealthy, move faster than the speed of light, and are basically either italian, jewish, or both.
  
  most of those are true, considering a lot of people born here are taught to be fast paced in their lifestyles. sometimes that can be interpreted as rude, and some people are rude, because they just want to get to where they need to be and do their business as quickly as possible. however, the only wealthy people live either on the very north shore or really far east (like the hamptons), and a large majority of us are just middle class.
  "
395005,"
   If you could have your dream wedding now what would it be like?

  i've never envisioned myself having a large wedding. something quaint in the woods or on the beach with a limited number of people is fine by me. i'd rather have a band over a DJ, the decorations on the table (like flower arrangements and whatnot) would be hand-made, and it would have a rustic feel to it.

   I can't beleive I have to tell you this, but Trump didn't say people should inject disinfectant.

Its a total reach to suggest he said to inject yourself with disinfectant
  ","
  even though he didn't tell people outright, ""hey, please do this!"" he's still putting the idea in people's minds. it's dangerous to even suggest that during a conference where millions of people will be watching. he should have, at the bare minimum, explained that scientists and virologists are trying to pursue different medical paths to combat against the virus without outright saying ""injecting a disinfectant.""

  yeah, i believe children who have been through the foster system definitely have a bad reputation because of why they become foster kids for one reason or another -- the blame is almost always wrongly on the children instead of on the parents or however the children were placed in foster care to begin with.
  
  it's important to consider those children's mental health, because sometimes going through the foster system can be traumatic and contribute to things like depression and anxiety and even PTSD. there are little resources for these children and they end up growing up into teenagers and adults with no vision for their future.

  i don't really believe the media is blowing it out of proportion, from what i can tell. the only thing they don't emphasize is the number of people who have successfully recovered -- they only report on the number of deaths, but that's journalism for you.
  
  long island was considered the epicenter of the virus at one point a few weeks ago, because we had the most number of cases and deaths compared to the rest of the country. i'm not sure if that still applies though. there's an 8:00pm curfew, most non essential businesses are closed, and essential workers have to carry about a slip everywhere they go saying they're essential if they're out. you can be fined if you're not wearing a mask out in public now, from what i recall. businesses can turn you away if you're not properly equipped.

395519,"
   Is it normal to have a crush on someone/ feelings towards someone just by reading their answers on here?
  ","
  eh, i wouldn't say it's normal as much as it isn't uncommon. however, even if you do think you're developing feelings for someone on social media, you also have to keep in mind that they're only posting parts of themselves they're willing to share -- not their entire being. you're attracted to a version of them, one that may not be them as a whole, and you have to be careful that you're not filling in the blanks with a fantasy of who you think they are.

  giving someone the silent treatment is to intentionally ignore someone for periods of time with no intention of discussing the issue. giving space to collect your thoughts means to sorta give a time-out on the discussion so both people can cool off and return to the conversation with fresh minds.

  ","
  i don't believe you're over thinking it at all -- that would bother me a lot too, tbh. admitting that you're wrong and apologizing is a major part of any relationship, romantic or platonic, and it doesn't make your partner any less of a person by admitting their mistakes.
  
  even though you said you tried talking to them about it and nothing changed, perhaps you can approach it from a different angle -- stating that you won't think any less of them if/when they do apologize, your relationship with them will remain intact, and there's nothing wrong with admitting that they're wrong in some cases.
  
  as long as they're not adamant that they're right all the time, i think it's important to try to talk to them again and work through this issue. good luck !!

  gender is something of exploration, and it's valid for some people to discover that they're cis after all. it isn't ""returning to their senses,"" it's a re-discovery of themselves and coming to terms with who they are.

  "
395616,"
   Why is it important for you to let others know that you're nonbinary?
  ","
  it isn't very important to me. i just have it in my bio so people know what my pronouns are.
  "
395617,"
   Okay, that makes more sense. I guess it's not important to me to call myself non-binary if I experience neither or both. I'm male and my identity isn't gender. It's just my identity and who I am. In a way it's close minded to tie standard feelings to one gender or another. They evolve.
  ","
  well, they're not feelings in terms of your personality. it's independent of your personality. it's how you view yourself, your body in some cases, etc etc.
  
  personally speaking, i experience dysphoria. because i don't identify as a woman, i dislike the fact that i have breasts and thighs & it makes me feel uncomfortable with myself because it doesn't fit my gender expression. if i could have top surgery (when i lose like 80 pounds), i would.
  "
395618,"
   That's why I asked you to give practical examples what it means to feel neither a woman or a man. How's it possible? You can identify with aspects from both because those are the only two modes a human being can possibly feel. Instead you give me some bulllshit definition.
  ","
  it isn't a bullsh*t definition, it's the standard definition that corresponds with what non-binary means. you don't identify with the standard feelings of what a woman is, neither do you identify with the standard feelings of what a man is.
  
  it varies for each individual, as well. some people feel both binaries at varying degrees (i.e. genderfluid) and others don't feel a gender at all (i.e. agender). i used to think i was genderfluid until i came across the term non-binary & realized it suited me better.
  "
395619,"

  ","
  they were popular for a hot minute when ""all the things she said"" came out, although it was mainly out of controversy because of the girl-on-girl action.

  ","
  they may be inquisitive to a certain extent, but they're also being degrading and close minded in that they're not allowing themselves to be educated on gender identity.
  
  there's only so much questioning until it becomes circular questioning (like a previous anon pointed out). at that point, it's tiresome.
  "
395622,"
   I actually understand gay, lesbian and trans struggles but non-binary doesn't make any sense to me. Gender as identity as a whole because it's impossible to consistently define masculine and feminine characteristics. Boths genders can possess both.
  ","
  gender identity is separate from gender expression. as shown in the chart and as i've stated earlier, non-binary is sorta the ""in between"" of the man and woman binaries.
  
  i'm not going to really get in-depth with this *again* because i've already explained this at least once in this thread.
  "
395623,"
   Nope, still doesn't make sense because you don't answer what it is you identify with. Absence of other identities isn't an identity. Care to give some practical examples how you are on inside that doesn't belong neither to a man or a woman.
  ","
  i already explained this, and i even offered a chart explaining this as well. there's only so much i can educate people on if they're not willing to open their minds to ideas that are foreign to them.
  
  i've given you plenty of answers, facts, & resources. it's ultimately up to you if you want to listen or not.
  "
395624,"
   Sorry, I'm no smarter. I don't understand how can your identity be something you don't identify with. What it is you identify with? Do you like both men and women?
  ","
  non-binary is an identity in itself, as there are more options to gender than man and woman.
  
  sexual orientation is different from your gender identity -- your gender is who you are inside, while your orientation is who you're sexually and/or romantically attracted to.
  "
395625,"
   Sorry you seem to be getting all this circular questioning from people who apparently didn't learning anything about gender after the age of 10.
  ","
  i thought i've been explaining it quite well, but apparently not. it goes to show how little people are educated on trans identities, unfortunately.
  
  i found this chart that may be useful for them ;
  "
395626,"
   That means absolutely nothing and everything. Explain what you identify with and what it has to do with gender at all. What it means to be non-binary?
  ","
  non-binary simply means that your gender is neither man nor woman (hence the prefix ""non"" referring to the binaries of gender). it's a gender identity in itself, but it can also be used an an umbrella term to also mean identities like genderfluid, agender, etc etc.

   That's the problem. Gender identity is simply a social construct at any given time in history. You call it non-binary but you are female that possesses male characteristics not a new gender. What constitues non-binary now may be acceptable for a woman 10 years from now.
  ","
  uh, this makes zero sense. like i said earlier, gender and sex are completely different. i'm not female with male characteristics, because that would insinuate that i have both male & female secondary sex characteristics. i'm not intersex.
  
  there's no problem with people being trans or non-binary. it's something personal to them and has no effect on anyone else's life. to claim it's unacceptable is transphobic, to say the least.

   Could you explain why writing can be described as a process for 
creating and a process for destroying?!
  ","
  writing is definitely a creative process in that you're developing different ways of describing and explaining events, emotions, etc etc., in a way that has never been described before. writing is a work of fine art, and it can be enjoyable to read writing that explains things in a way that is appealing to the audience.
  
  however, writing can also be a destructive process because you're literally purging yourself of your feelings and your energies in order to create that piece. it's like any art form of art, where you include a piece of yourself in that writing. it makes you vulnerable.

  "
395661,"
   In order to exclude yourself from being female or male, you first need to know what constitutes each gender's identity. How on earth do you then know what identity belongs to a woman and what to a man? It's an arbitrary concept. You can only be female or male and the rest is simply your identity.
  ","
  well, female and male are sexes -- not genders. you're assigned the genders girl or boy upon birth based upon that sex. you're also excluding the existence of intersex people who don't have the same chromosomes as males or females.
  
  gender is unique and different to each person, and even though someone is assigned a girl or a boy at birth, that doesn't mean that they'll grow up to feel attached to that gender identity. there are a plethora of people whose gender does not fit into the binaries of man and woman.

  "
395664,"
   No lol. That is called a personality. It's not a real science because it's a matter of opinion how you label yourself. Unless you're transgender or androgynous you're female. If you don't feel like one, you just have a different personality. No need to invent a label for that.
  ","
  gender identity isn't correlated with personality. additionally, the study of gender *is* a science congruent to disciplines such as sociology and cultural anthropology. genders other than man and woman have been evident for centuries.
  
  non-binary is a trans identity, because i am not my assigned gender at birth. also, the idea of androgyny has nothing to do with gender either -- androgyny is a physical expression of oneself through things like hair, makeup, clothing, etc etc.
  
  the idea of trans identities hasn't been ""invented,"" and it certainly is not a contemporary subject. it's simply talked about more now because it's become safer and more acceptable for people to come out as trans.

  (cont) ... I know it's silly but it just makes me uncomfortable for some reason. I would also feel the pressure to constantly be exciting and keep the person mesmerized in a marriage to avoid the spark dying out or being too boring like in everyday life. I have bpd (untreated atm) so I get crazily attached to people and since 50% of marriages end in divorce, I don't think it'd be able to handle starting all over because I don't do well with significant life changes. Do you have any advice? I don't wanna be stuck feeling like this for years and years. Thank you.
  
  --
  
  first off, i'm sorry it's taken me so long to get to this. i've been wanting to answer this on my laptop because it was in three parts, just for ease of access.
  
  i understand how you feel -- significant life changes frighten me to a certain degree as well, especially in terms of relationships. my breakup with my ex devastated me, and i'm still recovering from it even though it's been multiple months.
  
  you're 20 years old, so you're still incredibly young and will grow a lot throughout your 20s, whether you believe that or not. everything will eventually fall into place, and i find it's best to not have any expectations at all. when things should happen, they'll happen and i always just tried to roll with it and see where things go.
  
  the reason why half of marriages end in divorce these days isn't because of a lack of compatibility, but it's because people simply aren't putting up with their spouse's sh*t anymore. back in the day, people (especially women) endured ab*se from their partner, while today it's more accepted for those women to leave those relationships.
  
  if you're with the right person, that natural spark won't die out completely. you may become comfortable with each other, but you will both still have fun together, and you have to remember that your partner should also be your closest, best friend as well. if your chemistry is right, then you won't feel the pressure to keep that spark alive because it naturally will remain lit.

   Advice of the day?
  ","
  from a post i found on facebook ;
  
  ""if you’re finding yourself becoming weepier, snappier, or more anxious in response to regular life stressors, consider that for at least a month now, you’ve been:
  
  living under the threat of a pandemic, dealing with shortages of basic health and hygiene staples, worrying about the safety of everyone you know and love, wondering how to pay your bills, receiving inconsistent and confusing guidance from your government, while trying to home-school your kids and deal with all of their fears and anxieties...
  
  or being at home by yourself and unable to have physical contact with another human being, or risking your health every day by going to work because your job is too essential for you to stay home.
  
  all with no clear understanding of how or when this will end.
  
  so if you broke down sobbing today because the dishwasher acted up or a squirrel broke your bird feeder, that’s not overreacting. it’s just you being human. go easy on yourself. we’re all in this together.""
  "
395757,"
   why do you do most of the work?
  ","
  i don't, they're pretty equal. the bathroom is small, and there's only one wall of countertop in the kitchen. it takes me 10-15 minutes maximum. maybe 20 minutes if i decide to really scrub out the shower.
  
  i'd honestly say my other roommates do most of the work because the house is largely carpet (living room, hallway, and all three bedrooms). we vacuum the tiled bathroom and kitchen floors before we mop them, and my one roommate is the one who mixes the cleaning solution and whatnot before mopping.
  "

  i wholeheartedly agree. if someone doesn't want their partner to be friends with someone, then that means they obviously don't trust their partner. it has nothing to do with whether or not someone else likes your partner, you should ideally trust your partner to not betray the basic rule of a monogamous relationship. if you're afraid that their friendship with someone will ruin your relationship, then you need to re-evaluate your relationship.

  i've always related the most to chloe price from the video game ""life is strange."" well in particular, she reminds me of myself from perhaps 5-6 years ago when i was a bit more risk-taking and lively.
  
  she's impulsive, full of life and love and underlying anger with trauma from earlier in her life. she's drinks and smokes, and has a ""f*ck-it-all"" attitude that propels her forward in life. she has issues with abandonment and goes to desperate lengths to feel wanted and needed. as a result of her trauma, she's learned not to trust in anyone and is convinced that no one truly cares about her.
  
  there have been theories that chloe has borderline personality disorder, which obviously resonates with me considering i struggle with the same diagnosis. she's obviously suffered from depression & s*icidal thoughts throughout her life as well.

396052,"

  basically, the binary genders are man and woman. non-binary means that your gender is not man or woman.
  
  some people describe non-binary as a umbrella term for other genders such as agender, genderfluid, etc etc., but i've simply always preferred non-binary.

  i think evil can be defined as having bad, immoral, and/or dangerous intentions from a very young age. there are some people who have been classified as ""evil"" such as prolific serial k*llers like ted bundy and jeffrey dahmer.
  
  i do believe that everyone has a degree of both good and evil within them, it just depends on which part a person acts upon. some people are completely good, some are completely evil, but most people are somewhere in the middle.

  i haven't read it recently because i, unfortunately, haven't had the motivation to pick up a book these days.
  
  however, the book ""girl interrupted"" by susanna kaysen really changed my life when i was a teenager in dealing with and understanding mental illness. it's a quick read, but very insightful as it's an autobiographical sketch of the author's experience while living in a psychiatric ward for 12 months.

   If you could have the option of eradicating pain from your life would you choose to do so? Why or why not?
  ","
  eh, i don't think i would eradicate pain, to be honest. the pain we experience makes us humble, and the pain we've experienced in the past have obviously changed us both negatively and positively, but that pain has also taught us about ourselves (whether it's our own strengths or personality or tolerance).
  
  it would be ideal to live a life without pain, but i don't think we would grow anymore. pain teaches us.

  i don't necessarily believe in life after death (or reincarnation). however, i do believe that our souls or whatever makes us *us* is a form of energy, and energy cannot be destroyed. while our physical bodies perish, our energies simply get transferred to another medium.

396085,"
   At what point are we good enough? 

When are we self-improved enough to accept ourselves?

  self-acceptance is independent of self-improvement. we can accept ourselves while also realizing that we have much to learn and improve upon. i believe that life is a continuous journey of knowledge and discovery, particularly within ourselves.

  uh, my mother. she's never taken anyone else's feelings or lives into consideration & has always believed that she was the top priority regardless of what's going on in everyone else's lives. she expects people to drop what they're doing to cater to her wants, and it's entirely selfish and unfair.

  i'm not as much into horror as i was when i was younger, thanks to my lovely anxiety disorder (it causes panic and nightmares lately).

   My bf is starting to lose interest in me, ever since the coronavirus he has been distant. What can I do to make him interested in me again?

  are you sure the reason why you perceive him to be distant is because you physically cannot see him? the coronavirus has no doubt been hard on many relationships, but i wouldn't necessarily believe it's *you* that's causing the distance you perceive.
  
  (assuming you don't live together.)
  
  otherwise, i would simply bring it up in conversation with him. you won't get anywhere or learn anything if you don't open that line of communication.

  ","
  i don't really like the concept of ""cheat meals"" because that assumes that you're breaking a diet, and it has negative connotations. people who go on diets feel guilty when they ""cheat"" on their diet, and that isn't what losing weight/toning muscle/being healthy is all about. there's nothing wrong with eating an unhealthy meal every once in a while.

  there's a den that has an entire outside wall of glass to look outside, as well as an outside porch in the backyard that wraps around the house. i'd like a big bathroom with a clawed bathtub and a glass stand-up shower with a seat inside up against the wall.

  i think that's ridiculous. people need their jobs to support themselves, and it sounds as if he's likely supporting her and contributing to the household as well.
  
  to give someone, who's a key worker and *must* work, that ultimatum is entirely selfish. in a relationship, you're supposed to be working as a team. it's hard when your partner is working extra hours, but you need to find a way to make it work.

  i've been taking my regular xanax twice per day, but it hasn't been helping at all. i started taking some herbal anti-anxiety medications from the pharmacy, and they've been helping a little in conjunction with my xanax, but every day i've woken up with a beating in my chest and inability to breathe.

  she's exactly right. like i stated earlier, you can be a carrier and display no symptoms, but you're just as much of a risk as anyone else to pass the virus onto someone else.
  
  that's why i haven't visited my parents' house lately (except today to bring the garbage cans in). my mother is immunocompromised, and for some reason she doesn't seem to understand that i can still carry the virus even if i don't show symptoms, and i don't want to subject her to it at all. i live with two people who are essential workers who go to work with the public every day. it's highly probable that they're bringing the virus home with them.

  yes, most definitely. isolation in times of a global pandemic such as this is integral because it reduces the spread of the virus. when people would normally be going out to bars, restaurants, stores, etc etc., they're now regulated and cannot go out as they please to interact with hundreds of people on a regular basis.

  honestly, i agree. it's difficult to develop a vaccine and then patent it, test it through clinical trials, etc etc. right now, the best way to reduce the number of deaths is through isolating people to their homes and treating the current positive patients as best as they possibly can.

  i'm proud of myself for surviving my life thus far, and still holding onto the motivation to continue improving myself despite the hardships i've endured. i've struggled with mental illness since i was a pre-teen, and i only sought professional help when i was 25 years old. my entire life has changed since then, for the better. i genuinely think that if i didn't make that move to help myself at 25, i would have passed away.

   What advantages or positive things have you noticed from the current situation?
  ","
  i see absolutely zero advantages or positive things about the global pandemic. there are some people who consider it a ""blessing"" to be with their families during this time, but to call it a blessing completely ignores the fact that there are a majority of people who are in inconvenient and often dangerous circumstances as a result of quarantine.
  
  people are stuck at home with ab*sive spouses. children are stuck at home with ab*sive parents. there's a significant population who are at risk and vulnerable to the coronavirus, which makes it difficult to see family if they need supplies. individuals are dying at an alarming rate, and there are still so many people who aren't practicing social distancing and that's making the situation even worse. to call the pandemic a ""blessing"" is ignorant.

   Is it more important to you to help yourself, help your family, help your community, or help the world? Why?
  ","
  i believe they're all important in different ways, so it depends entirely on the individual as to what is the *most* important. for me personally, the most important thing at the moment is helping myself. i'm in a position where i need to heal from past traumas, past struggles, past failures, etc etc. in order for me to be the best version of yourself, i need to help myself to the fullest extent.
  "
396501,"
   Do you agree that loneliness can be addictive and therefore dangerous?
  ","
  i believe using the word ""addictive"" takes it a step too far, because addiction implies that someone has a physical dependence on something in that a person ends up going through withdrawals when they're without that substance.
  
  loneliness is dangerous to begin with, point blank. loneliness is a negative feeling, and i believe the word that's better for this particular question is ""solitude."" you can be in solitude and not be lonely, and there's nothing wrong with that. a lot of people enjoy being in solitude.
  "
396502,"
   Is forgiveness important to you, or do you think that it is better to hold grudges?
  ","
  i don't believe it's better to hold grudges, no. holding a grudge only ends up hurting yourself in the end, because you're clenching onto negative feelings and auras regardless of how the other person feels.
  
  sometimes you don't forgive someone, but you also don't hold a grudge against that person. and that's perfectly okay.
  "
396503,"
   What are the three most important values that you would like to instill in your children/future children? If you don’t think you want kids, what three values do you believe to be important?
  ","
  three values that i believe to be of the utmost importance are compassion, loyalty, and honesty.
  
  compassion -- because it's integral to cultivate meaningful relationships with others, and to have a sense of empathy in order to help those around you (as well as yourself).
  
  loyalty -- because it's important to be true to your word, as well as be true to yourself and others. if you cannot be loyal to your friends or partner, then you need to re-evaluate your meaning of relationships and how it can impact everyone involved.
  
  honesty -- because honesty is perhaps one of the most important facets of maintaining meaningful relationships with others, platonic or otherwise. you need to be honest with yourself and with other people in order to progress forward.

396623,"
   Hypothetically speaking, for example. Someone beats my brother to death, there is no evidence who did it but I know who and I kill him and there are evidence that I done it and I end up in jail for 20 years, do I deserve it?
  ","
  i understand the vigilante approach, but to be fair, the fact that you m*rdered someone who previously m*rdered someone you loved doesn't really make you much better than the original person. so while you were emotionally driven to seek vengeance, the outcome of that scenario remains the same as the original person who hurt your brother.
  
  as for morality -- revenge is far different from someone who's killing out of a sheer desire to simply kill. in terms of good and bad, i wouldn't consider you a bad person for doing what you did.
  "
396624,"
   at what point is starting a new friendship considered too forward, invasive?
  ","
  i think new friendships that are rooted in destructive habits and/or toxicity, like both people are feeding off of each other's problematic behavior, can soon become invasive and too forward. in those cases, you're simply bonding out of a shared desire for self-destruction, especially if you're both encouraging the other person to engage in bad behavior.
  "
396625,"
   do you truly believe the corona virus is a man made disease created by the chinese as a weapon to rid of the rest of the world or do you find your beliefs to be more realistic and scientific?
  ","
  for the most part, i believe that the coronavirus (well, COVID-19 specifically) is simply a mutated, stronger version of the coronavirus that no one was able to predict because we had not yet come across that strain before. that's why it's been so destructive and lethal like nothing we've ever seen before. without proper knowledge or vaccines, we're left to fend for ourselves.
  
  granted -- i do think the conspiracy theories are interesting, and i also believe there's more of an underlying political part of this outbreak than what's shown in the media. but i don't believe it's a man-made biological weapon or anything.
  "
396626,"
   I see, how do we know what people deserve? ^^

   You seem a person with higher Intelligence quotient than the rest that I've asked. So, what's right and what's wrong?
  ","
  right and wrong is subjective depending upon a person's own sense of morality. obviously there are also guidelines that dictate what's right versus wrong (i.e. the law), but in most cases people will do what they want according to their own moral system.
  
  i believe that if an activity hurts a person who does not deserve to be hurt, then it's a bad activity (including if it hurts yourself). right actions, on the other hand, are indifferent actions or actions that benefit people.

   Hi goog night :)
  ","
  hello -- do you have a question?
  "
396630,"
   Is a “wrong” act okay if nobody ever knows about it?

396636,"
   Do you apologize first when you fought/fight with your SO?

  depends on whether or not i'm in the wrong, lmaoo. if i did something wrong then i have no problem with apologizing. it's better to own up to your mistakes instead of deflecting blame or ignoring the mistake entirely.
  "
396637,"

  my best skill is my talent in writing. i utilize it everyday at work, for which i'm quite thankful.

   What is your favorite movie or book (or both!) and why did it speak to you so much?
  ","
  my favorite book is ""girl interrupted"" by susanna kaysen. i read it when i was a teenager and fell in love with it because it described exactly what i experience in terms of mental illness. it taught me that i wasn't alone in how i was feeling, and it also encouraged me to express my feelings and symptoms via the written word.
  "
396642,"
   Would you relocate for love?
  ","
  depends on the pros and cons of moving outside of the relationship. i would have to have a guaranteed job that i'll enjoy (or i'd even work my current job remotely if possible). i'd have to consider the financial ramifications involved as well.
  
  loving someone simply isn't enough, in most cases. you need to preserve yourself and do what's best for yourself as well.
  "
396643,"
   Is it important to you for your parents to approve of who you’re dating/married to?

  being productive throughout the day, whether it's through my daily work at my job or doing chores around the house.

  when i have to be, yes. i don't go out of my way to be confrontational, though, nor is it something innate within me.

  ","
  it's the same amount of work as when i'm in the office.
  "
396647,"
   So, would you say that happiness is a state of mind? ^_^
  ","
  happiness is a feeling that is influenced by external factors in one's life, as well as one's own attitude.
  
  it's also the result of stable hormones and neurotransmitters, on a biological level at the very least.
  "
396648,"
   Can you define me happiness in your words?

  happiness is an elevated state of contentness with oneself, one's life, one's social circle, and/or one's accomplishments.

396661,"
   What’s more important to you in a relationship if you had to choose: looks or brains? Why?
  ","
  looks can be decently important, but it's ultimately intelligence that determines whether or not a relationship can continue. looks are superficial, meanwhile intelligence and having conversations with a person truly is what connects you intimately with someone else.

  "
396663,"
   What’s your definition of justice and revenge? Would you say they’re different in your opinion?
  ","
  justice and revenge are similar in that they're both dedicated toward putting those who commit wrongdoings in a state of punishment.
  
  however, justice deals more with the law and law enforcement and abide by governmental regulations. revenge, on the other hand, deals primarily with individuals who wish to take means of punishment into their own hands -- like a vigilante, for instance. revenge is more personal than anything else.

  yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous. health care facilities, like hospitals and clinics and now even the javits center, are pleading with the government for more ventilators, and trump has the audacity to say ""nah, i don't think you need them"" or ""no, your nurses are hoarding all of the masks."" it's absolutely infuriating.
  
  nurses and doctors are wearing the same masks for several 12-13 hour shifts in a row, multiple days in a row. i read somewhere that even patients are sharing ventilators because ventilators have become so sparse. it's ridiculous.

  yeah, it's absolutely terrible to hear alongside the patients who have been suffering from the coronavirus as well. in most countries (especially the united states), hospitals and other facilities simply do not have the adequate equipment necessary to treat everyone, as well as protect themselves. doctors and nurses are forced to wear the same mask for days at a time because there has been such a shortage.

  -- deconstruct tasks into multiple smaller steps. it's much easier to tackle a difficult task when you've broken it up into progressive parts that you can check off as you go along.
  
  -- remember to take time to go at your own pace and remember to breathe. not everything is a rush, and you need to take your own tolerance into consideration.
  
  -- remember that things *will* get better, even if they don't seem that way at the moment. the truth is that most things are only temporary and will come to pass.

396803,"
   ito should there be tougher punishment for those that get involved with banned dangerous drugs? it shouldn't be easy to get out of jail and opt out of rehab to go back doing same shxt
  ","
  drug addiction is a health care issue, not a criminal issue. part of the reason why there's so much recidivism is because the addict still obtains the drugs in prison, which only aggravates the addiction more. instead of giving them a tougher prison sentence, addicts should have the opportunity to be enrolled in comprehensive rehabilitation programs that they can actually afford.

   how is your state faring with the pandemic? are you guys doing okay?
  ","
  i live in new york, which is now considered the ""epicenter"" of the coronavirus at the moment because of the high volume of cases and deaths. there are over 8,000 cases on long island alone, not counting the boroughs or upstate new york.
  
  things are going as ""well"" as they can be, i suppose. people have been instructed to stay inside unless it's for essential travel.
  "

   i got super emotional last night bc of the coronavirus. i really tried to not cry bc i didnt want to lmao but my tears came out like a river. i fear i'll always get tears if i talk about it.
  ","
  yeah, the coronavirus is definitely making people emotional for a variety of reasons. your emotions are completely valid.
  "
396831,"
   What movie do you think is overrated?
  ","
  i don't really have high standards when it comes to movies, haha. however, when napoleon dynamite first came out while i was in high school (i think), everyone was obsessed with it. i watched it and thought it was terrible, though.
  "
396832,"
   Why do you think people don't take mental health seriously? Is it because they can't see it like they can with physical health problems?
  ","
  that is part of the issue, yes. a lot of people diminish the significance of mental health and mental illness because it's an ""invisible illness,"" and there are also some people who believe that mental illness is something one can control or get over, which can't be further from the truth.
  "
396833,"
   At what point in a relationship do you think is the best time ot move in together?
  ","
  it varies depending on the relationship -- some people want to move in together after a few months, other people wait a few years. it's whatever feels most natural to the specific relationship.
  "

  yes, i actually took the 23andme ancestry test a few years ago !! the results were definitely interesting.
  "

  no, my roommates and i rarely have the opportunity to do so.

396838,"
   Are you the kind of person who moves on quickly?
  ","
  depends on the situation because it's both yes and no.
  "
396839,"
   What is a personality trait you cannot stand in other people?
  ","
  i cannot stand arrogance and/or close-mindedness the most. it's frustrating when people cannot think outside of their own bubble and automatically assume everything contrary to their own opinion is wrong.

  no one is immune. recently, an infant in new york passed away from the coronavirus.
  "
396847,"
   How’s the reaction has anything to do with politics? Lol
  ","
  look at everything trump has been saying about the coronavirus -- he's been downplaying the virus completely & making statements that go against everything medical professionals are saying. a lot of people are wondering if it's because he doesn't want this pandemic to affect his possible re-election.
  "
396848,"
   Do you think it’s man made?
  ","
  no, lol. i don't believe there's any political cause behind the coronavirus. however, the reaction to the virus from various governments *is* politically-driven, and that's what is concerning.

  like a cure or vaccine? i believe so, yes.

  i read the bible when i was much, much younger.
  "
396860,"
   i respect your opinion 
but can you give one reason why you don't believe ?
  ","
  there's no scientific proof of the existence of any god, and i'm of the understanding that most people only believe in god because they have faith. i don't have that faith, and i never did.

396861,"

  obviously because i don't believe in god.

  "
396866,"
   What is the weirdest ""scam"" you have come across?
  ","
  i don't think i've ever personally come across any weird scams. i've only ever dealt with the ones where the elderly and others get a phone call where they're told their family member is in trouble & they have to wire transfer a ridiculous amount of money to the scammer.
  "
396867,"
   What kind of place do you think is ideal for the first date? Why do you think so?

  probably a coffee shop -- it's ideal because obviously there's coffee, and its a good environment to sit down and get to know someone.

  "
396870,"
   do you think people who don't work out are lazy if they dont have medical issues?
  ","
  no, exercising isn't a requirement or anything to be a regular human being, lol. i'm sure some people choose not to exercise because of laziness but that isn't always the case.
  "
396871,"
   I guess I’ll add more context. My bf cheated on me and is trying to convince that he loves and cares about me. But I personally believe that if he loved and cared he wouldn’t do that
  ","
  tbh, i agree with you -- cheating is a conscious decision, and if he genuinely does love and care for you, then he would have stopped himself and thought about how this would affect you.
  "
396872,"
   If you cheat on someone, you never loved them in the first place. Agree or disagree?
  ","
  not necessarily. feelings change over time, and just because someone has cheated doesn't necessarily mean they *never* loved you. however, the fact that they did cheat obviously does indicate that they don't care about seeing you get hurt.
  "
396873,"
   I wouldn't want my man talking to his ex of 10 years every day. Personally

  neither, i've been trying more than anything else to focus on the present moment.

  yes, my friends consider me very loyal and trustworthy because i always keep their secrets to myself.

  "
396897,"
   what is your opinion on people not taking covid seriously? i know many who saying its overhyped and just a flu
  ","
  it's definitely not *just* the flu, especially considering how fast it's been spreading over the past month alone and how lethal it has been to people of all ages. then coronavirus is a serious matter & it infuriates me when people aren't taking precautions seriously. they're drawing their own conclusions based on what they personally see, instead of listening to health care professionals.
  
  if you don't know anyone who has tested positive, it's most likely because the test is difficult to come by and they simply haven't had the privilege to be tested yet.
  "
396898,"

396900,"
   if a friend asked you to come over and hang out or wanted to come over would you allow it

  no, not at the moment -- especially considering the virus is supposed to peak in the next two weeks in new york. it's safer for everyone to simply stay home.

396901,"
   as if that would solve things. parents like that are good at being in denial and somehow turning things and making it out to be your fault and manipulating you into feeling guilty and ungrateful lol thank god i moved out too

  ugh, you're absolutely right. she's manipulated and gaslighted me for my entire life, and guaranteed if i brought up the word ""ab*se"" she would turn it around against me and claim that i'm trying to ruin her reputation, or something wild like that.

396902,"
   old generation is like that tbh your mom sounds like mine exactly

  i'm sorry in that case, lol. i know first hand how difficult it is dealing with a parent like this.

  "
396903,"
   do you like the quarantine? im getting cabin fever
  ","
  tbh, i don't mind it at all. i'm fortunate in that i'm still working monday through friday but at home, so it's something to take my mind off of things and keep me occupied during most of the day.
  "
396904,"
   maybe she doesn't even think of it as ab*se cos my moms the same way and in denial lolol
  ","
  she definitely doesn't, which is so bizarre to me because it was both physical & verbal. she always berates me these days and tells me ""i don't know how you turned out this way!"" regarding my mental health issues. she doesn't realize that my upbringing between both her and my father is the cause of all of my problems.
  "
396905,"
   whats the situation like in your town? is there police patrolling to make sure no ones out besides for necessary needs
  ","
  i haven't been outside the house besides to sit on my stoop in 10 days, lmaoo. i'm not really sure how things are outside, but according to my roommates, the roads are much emptier than usual. i'm not really sure of the police presence, but i do hear sirens often throughout the day.
  "
396906,"
   do you think your mom loves you even little or just wants to use you to do chores
  ","
  i'm unsure of the term ""love"" because you cannot unconditionally love someone & then ab*se them for over 15 years of their life. she's always seemed to have an ulterior motive, though, and she always tried to make me feel guilty about saying no or prioritizing myself.
  "
396907,"

  yeah, he works in new york city so ... i guess he's as safe as he can reasonably be. from my understanding, he still has to work through all of this.
  "
396909,"
   then do facetime
  ","
  we talk on the phone every few days as it is. i really do think she just wanted me to bring breakfast over, show my face, and do her laundry though despite the chaos going on in the world. i'm not going to risk my own health & her health just because she's denying that the coronavirus is a huge deal.
  "
396910,"
   why she wanna see you
  ","
  i haven't visited in about a month ever since the whole quarantine thing started.
  "
396911,"
   then why should u go pick up breakfast for your mom. you can call and ask them to deliver at her house?
  ","
  she could have done that herself, yeah. the issue was that she wanted to see me, even though everyone is urging others to stay in their own houses and practice social distancing. she's also immunocompromised, but apparently isn't even concerned for her own health.

  "
396919,"
   How do you feel about rxpe play? Where one person pretends to be non consenting
  ","
  this one sorta weirds me out too, tbh. i'm not sure how i feel about it because even though they're pretending to be non-consenting, they actually are performing consensual activity. at the same time, though, it's probably common among people who have experienced assault and are the kink as a coping mechanism.

396920,"
   Do you have any pictures of gardens that you would like to share? Maybe look one up to share with us?
  ","
  studio ghibli gardens & illustrations overall are beautiful.
  "
396921,"
   Agreed. Age regression is perfectly ok as a form of therapy imo, but when you combine it with a sxxual relationship, that's when it becomes disgusting.
  ","
  i wholeheartedly agree. i'm usually incredibly accepting and understanding of most kinks as long as they're between two consenting adults, but DDLG is definitely not one of them.
  "
396922,"
   Exactly. If you have to dress your partner up as an infant and have them act like a child to get off, you're extremely creepy. They also share it with the world then shame ppl who think it's odd. Idiots. People who age regress are usually victims of CSA too which tells you a lot.
  ","
  yeah, it seems like more of a very unhealthy coping mechanism in light of their age regression & trauma than anything else. it has no place in the bedroom.
  "
396923,"
   Thoughts on ddlg?
  ","
  DDLG is honestly the one ""kink"" that i cannot support. it isn't healthy for someone to pretend to be a child in a s*xual relationship, and then for their partner to pretend to be grooming a child like that. it's always seemed incredibly wrong to me.
  "

  "
396929,"
   Does she understand how the virus spread? Why can’t she do her own laundry?
  ","
  she's pretty much bed-bound so unfortunately i will have to go over there & do some chores for her eventually since my father is out of state for the next two weeks (extremely long story, he's safe and it's for a valid reason).
  
  but i honestly don't think she understands the gravity of the situation. nobody is really supposed to leave their homes to see other people except those they already live with. i'm not sure if she even watches the news or not.
  "
396930,"
   Which exotic place would you love to visit?
  ","
  i don't usually talk about my family, but i'm legit so livid rn because of my mother's carelessness about the coronavirus.
  
  she texted me earlier this morning & asked me to pick up egg sandwiches for breakfast and go over her house to do a load of her laundry. i responded & told her that we cannot leave the house unless it's absolutely necessary, and after about 10 minutes, she sent me a huge paragraph about ""you haven't left your house & i haven't left mine so it's fine ... thanks anyway"" (to shorten it a lot).
  
  like... it's like she doesn't understand we're all in quarantine. not only can i be an asymptomatic carrier because both of my roommates interact with the public on a daily basis, but she's also immuno-compromised and in her 60s. realistically she should be concerned for her health, but instead she gets angry with me for following what the CDC and governor says to do. it's unbelievable.
  "
396931,"
   what summer activities are you looking forward to? (hoping the coronavirus is gone by then.)

  oh jeez, LOL.
  "
396933,"

396934,"

396935,"
   You an introvert or an extrovert??
