Not in a bad way, but expressing a part of themselves that they normally wouldn\u2019t.\n  ","857277":"\n  26\n  ","857278":"\n  No no no no no. If I found out my son wasn\u2019t actually my child; I would love to meet my actual child and have a relationship with them, but I will not give up the child that I originally walked out with and raised for a year.\n  ","857279":"\n  Tall?! Freak tf out.\n  ","857280":"\n  57%\n  ","857281":"\n  My alarm usually goes off and I get up about an hour before my family to have to quiet time to myself. I make myself some tea and check my phone. It\u2019s nice \ud83d\ude0c\n  ","857282":"\n  I don\u2019t know\n  ","857283":"\n  That all depends on how small things would shrink. When I was a child, I always wanted to spend all my money on an elaborate doll house and then shrink myself down to live in it. I think it would save me a lot of money \ud83d\ude02\n  ","857284":"\n  Well I wouldn\u2019t know how to work it, I\u2019d probably take it to the science lab at my old college.\n  ","857285":"\n  I am! \ud83d\ude0a\n  ","857286":"\n  TBH I haven\u2019t give him a chance. Maybe I should?\n  ","857287":"\n  Thank you!\n  ","857288":"\n  I wouldn\u2019t make any one of them longer or be repeated twice a year. Holidays are the most wonderful and stressful times. Everyone is spending money they don\u2019t have (stress) to see happiness on other people\u2019s faces (wonderful) Plus, they are more special when it\u2019s just once a year :)\n  ","857289":"\n  I suppose, if you\u2019re not used to interracial relationships.\n  ","857290":"\n  None that have stopped me from living my life. So I guess they aren\u2019t that serious to be labeled as a \u201cphobia\u201d\n  ","857291":"\n  I\u2019ll totally share!\n  \n  Here some ideas for some cash:\n  \n  Sell art online\n  \n  Start making videos of your journey on YT (the cash might come a bit slower, but the journey would make an interesting story)\n  \n  When you get a car, I recommend trying to be an Uber driver for some cash as well :)\n  ","857292":"\n  I think it\u2019s really a toss up honestly. I\u2019ve seen some animals be more loyal to they\u2019re own than I\u2019ve seen in any human.... but I\u2019ve also seen the savagery. Plus aren\u2019t we technically animals? Just more advanced?\n  ","857293":"\n  If you look back, you\u2019re looking in the wrong direction.\n  \n  Unless you\u2019re reminiscing about a nice time.\n  ","857294":"\n  I hate lying, it makes me feel icky. I usually lie when I\u2019m around strangers so they can leave me alone quicker.\n  ","857295":"\n  Tired but great!\n  ","857296":"\n  Maybe if I was on a motorcycle\n  ","857297":"\n  Not many. I\u2019m not a huge meat eater and for no particular reason.\n  ","857298":"\n  Like longing for someone? Missing them.\n  ","857299":"\n  I have no idea who those people are.\n  ","857300":"\n  They\u2019re not, but they\u2019re always gonna be here forever. You have to learn to cancel that bs noise out. A happy life is the best thing you can throw at the haters.... because they obviously don\u2019t have one.\n  ","857301":"\n  Yes. I guess I\u2019m half in one \ud83d\ude02 since I\u2019m half white half black.\n  ","857302":"\n  I\u2019m not a fan of the new new ones. They are getting worse and worse. I like the OG\u2019s.\n  ","857303":"\n  Very. I\u2019m in one.\n  ","857304":"\n  I\u2019m great thank you!!\n  ","857305":"\n  Oh, yes!\n  ","857306":"\n  Half black half white\n  \n  With a whole bunch of other thangs mixed in there.\n  ","857307":"\n  Double noice!\n  ","857308":"\n  Some people think I\u2019m pretty some people think I\u2019m ugly.\n  \n  Some people think I\u2019m nice some people think I\u2019m bitchy.\n  \n  So I think it\u2019s really a toss up.\n  \n  Then again, nobody can really judge me unless they know me personally, so I\u2019m not too concerned about what people think of me.\n  \n  The only person I care who thinks of me is my son.\n  ","857309":"\n  Thanks bruh\n  ","857310":"\n  5\u20191\u2019\u2019\n  ","857311":"\n  26\n  ","857312":"\n  Yes\n  ","857313":"\n  WA, US\n  ","857314":"\n  Great! Thank you.\n  ","857315":"\n  Yes. For my man.\n  "}}
