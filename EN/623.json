My dad was poor growing up, he got through every school he went too by scholarship because without it his family wouldn't have had enough money to have sent him to school. He went to boarding school (first scholarship) at age 12 and had I think like two jobs to pay for food and was on the baseball team and had incredible grades. Then he got a scholarship for another high school and my dad rebelled around this age. Apparently went to prison for 18 months. Which makes this story even more incredible, so after prison (my dad hasn't really told me much about this part of his life so this all I know) he had two full time jobs and got a scholarship into college because I think he scored in the very high range on the SAT so he went San Diego so he lived in a car for those 4 years of college to save money cause he ended up going to South America for a bit. After that he got offered a job at UCSD microbiology then somehow met my mom who told him to go to school as a lawyer, so he went to take the bar exam and ended up getting a scholarship to law school after that. Graduated law school being one the top lawyers in San Diego got offered to be partnered which makes 500,000 a year but he was like fuck that I want to spend time with my kids and made his own law firm and bam now we're here.\n  \n  My mom on the other hand is more generational money. We're from Hiroshima, and my grandpa was royalty he was a 'prince' because my grandma and her sisters married my grandpa and his brothers, it was all arranged and they owned bowling alleys, apartments, bars, and clubs all over in Chicago and then in San Fransisco they had acres and acres of vineyards all before the war. My mom said her parents were billionaires before she was born. But after the war, for my mom to have a better life her parents had to give up pretty much everything....but the government gave everyone in my moms side few millions   So that's how they funded my mom through college and stuff but my mom got her career at age 24 and was making 6 figures by then... And 30 years later she was making 10 sooo.... I think that's why my parents are gross rich.\n  \n  Sorry not sorry this is so long but you asked, it's not a simple answer lol ?\n  ","669180":"\n  My momma is Rome so all I did was send her this because it's exactly what she wants ?\n  ","669181":"\n  I'm not but my parents are ?\n  ","669182":"\n  Yeah cause I just keep a high score record when I sneeze ?\n  ","669183":"\n  LOVE ???\n  ","669184":"\n  Depends how sick I am ? but it's mostly just two\n  ","669185":"\n  I would kill for my mothers ambition and strength.
