and kevin would have ended up pretty much where he did at the end of the first rooters episode . i don t remember why we didn t go that way , i think maybe no one could work up any enthusiasm to do an aggregor story . as a large part of the crew had worked on ag s ua story arc , i don t think anyone was in any hurry to get back to him . one other thing that didn t get left out , but it did get kind of confused was the prototech armor . my original intention was that , unknown to rook , he had been field testing this new prototype prototech armor for the rooters . the rooters would have been wearing the armor because of rook s successful testing of it for them . i can t really remember why this didn t get fixed either . probably either it was too late , or no one cared enough to change it . here s a little list of original ideas for the rooters i put down on my phone so i wouldn t forget . the second name on the list was supposed to be the african american plumber with the visor from the flashbacks . i m blurring it out in case we want to save it for something else .","205753":"well , he s not a b . l . r . r . t .","205754":"you mean jerry ?
