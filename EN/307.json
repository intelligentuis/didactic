often , and i m pretty sure it s a worldwide dilemma . i ve definitely noticed it within myself because i have some friends who encourage it unconsciously like if i text someone to daydrink , they ll be enthusiastic about it instead of asking me why i want to in the first place . i ve most definitely used alcohol as a crutch in the past , as you well know , but ever since i moved out of my parents

should not say they have a disorder if they haven t been professionally diagnosed .","284038":"i m doing fine . i just finished up my work for the day , and now i m planning on relaxing and watching a few comedy specials to take my mind off of current events .","284039":"lol , no problem ! ! he also has three specials on netflix , which i ll be watching tonight .","284040":"ninegdxfour has the freedom to do what she wants with her life . it doesn t affect me .","284041":"no , i don t follow people on request .","284042":"i have seven tattoos .","284043":"no need to worry , i ll deny it so don t bother sending one .","284044":"as my bio indicates , i live in new york .","284045":"sure , there are many happy endings that exist in the world .","284046":"my instagram is private .","284047":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","284048":"i like people of virtually all genders , at this point . although boy holds the presumption that a person is under the age of , which isn t appealing or legal at all .","284049":"i m not sure i know what this means .","284050":"i don t have one . i haven t had a crush on someone since high school .","284051":"no , i m the same type of person today as i was yesterday .","284052":"eh , depends on the remainder of their personality and other opinions they might hold , because you can t base a friendship off of one facet of their beliefs . while i m vehemently pro choice , i also have acquaintances who i believe are pro life but we don t talk often and they don t express their views unless prompted .","284053":"it s going quite well , actually ! ! i don t mind the quarantine at all , especially considering i ve become somewhat of a homebody since moving into the new house last year .","284054":"i don t have a plan , really . i m just taking each day at a time , because the coronavirus situation is changing every moment and there s not much for us to expect . i m just going to continue working from home and spending my spare time doing things that i enjoy .","284055":"thankfully , i work from am to pm every day , so that takes up a large chunk of my time . in my spare time , i ve been watching television , listening to music , and playing video games .","284056":"i m doing well . i only woke up about minutes ago , tbh . i poured myself a glass of iced coffee and now i m essentially just waiting for my work day to begin .","284057":"they re most likely complete strangers who have no connection to me , tbh . it doesn t concern me who they are , anyway .","284058":"i ve never heard it be called that , tbh . but i suppose it s because those people are under the wrong assumption that the coronavirus only affects the elderly , which couldn t be further from the truth .","284059":"i don t recall off the top of my head , but at least or rolls .","284060":"no , i don t believe i actually own any clothing that s pink .","284061":"idk , but instead of talking about the coronavirus , let s talk about bret kreischer instead . this f ckin skit made me laugh so hard . https youtu . be pag lptixa","284062":"yes , i ve experienced hail on several occasions . the most recent time was perhaps the scariest i was driving to my coworker s house it started hailing terribly outside , i had to pull my car over underneath an overpass because i was afraid it was going to break my windshield .","284063":"yeah , usually in the form of cheeseburgers .","284064":"no , high school was terrible college wasn t anything special . i went to college full time also worked basically full time as well . i was only on campus for my classes .","284065":"i don t find strangers to be terribly interesting , they re strangers for a reason .","284066":"i m not much of a fan of horror anymore , but i used to like the texas chainsaw massacre , the hills have eyes , and house of corpses .","284067":"i like hozier , but i ve never heard of mitski before .","284068":"yes , i live with two cats .","284069":"sounds good , friend . stay safe .","284070":"maybe make a new email address using the username you want then askfm will leverage that to create your username ? that seems awfully bothersome though , i wouldn t personally put in that much effort for askfm , lmaoo . welcome back tho ! !","284071":"depends on the individual and whether or not i m comfortable around them .","284072":"tbh i have no idea . that s really frustrating , though . this is the first someone has said this to me , i wouldn t have known otherwise .","284073":"hm , that s really odd . i m using an android phone on the app . when i go on the website on my phone , it comes up like this","284074":"i don t particularly care about someone else s income , so it would depend on their personalities . a person s source of income their recreational activities don t define who someone is .","284075":"it doesn t come up like that for me . the username field is right beneath the name field .","284076":". . . that doesn t sound right at all . are you sure ?","284077":"i m watching the linkin park stream they recorded yesterday , where members of the band watch an old show of theirs and have conversations about it . i m so happy , it s so hilarious . ask me questions , y all","284078":"it s against askfm terms conditions , and anons only ask sexual questions because they re perverts .","284079":"when it benefits the greater good , i suppose .","284080":"eh , i can see both perspectives . sex isn t a taboo subject and should be talked about in order to increase awareness and safe sex practices , especially among teenagers . it isn t seen as private business for everyone , some people are more open than others . i have no problems talking to my friends about my sex life , for example . if anything , i get into too much detail because i have no shame , lmaoo .","284081":"people who speak over me while i m speaking , drivers who are irresponsible and reckless , and people who don t follow social distancing rules from medical professionals . my roommate came home from work said his coworker came in this morning , coughing and with a fever . so he s going to wind up taking a coronavirus test if he tests positive , then my roommate s job is going to close and he can t work for two weeks .","284082":"i like watching the buzzfeed unsolved videos , especially the supernatural ones .","284083":"not really , no . there are plenty of things for me to do to entertain myself .","284084":"yeah , my friend told me the same thing . i stayed in my bedroom the entire time .","284085":"i don t know how parents do it , man . i ve been working from home i clock out at pm every night . my roommate came home with his girlfriend and her toddler , and the toddler was screaming and running around for the last three hours of my workday . i couldn t focus at all , lmaoo . props to parents who are working from home and balancing parent life on top of this . my door was closed and i was still so distracted .","284086":"yeah , celebrities who are saying so are incredibly privileged and don t know the half of what the typical middle and lower classes are dealing with right now .","284087":"where on earth on my page does it suggest that i would even contemplate entertaining this idea ?","284088":"no , i don t care about what other people do in their spare time .","284089":"yes , that s correct .","284090":"most likely , yes . no one deserves go through a heartache like being cheated on .","284091":"no , definitely not . not everyone has a good relationship with their family , and they find more comfort and support in friends and partners .","284092":"criminal minds , wentworth , ncis , how i met your mother , parks rec , it s always sunny in philadelphia , bones , supernatural , the x files , and others that i can t remember .","284093":"i m not quite sure , tbh . students still need to finish their curriculum , and i m not sure that school districts really know how to handle the situation yet since we don t know how long quarantining will last .","284094":"just a hairband , i don t wear jewelry or watches or anything .","284095":"yeah , i pretty much live in them during the autumn and winter months .","284096":"non alcoholic iced tea or coffee . alcoholic depends on my mood , but usually i ll order a beer or a margarita . sometimes i ll order a disaronno on the rocks .","284097":"no , i m not very superstitious at all .","284098":"my friends , my career , mental health awareness , the arts , and writing .","284099":"i enjoy ice cream on occasion , but i rarely eat it . i like green tea ice cream , cookies and cream , and chocolate chip cookie dough .","284100":"yes , sushi is one of my favorite foods .","284101":"i very seldom wear makeup , and it s been over one month since i probably last wore it . i don t wear it to work or anything , and the only times i ll apply makeup is if i m going out to the bar with friends .","284102":"i was years old when i got my first tattoo .","284103":"yeah , i get a lot of hate online specifically askfm in particular for simply being non binary , which can be amusing at times because my gender shouldn t exactly affect anyone else . irl , not so much . i don t advertise my gender and i seldom leave the house to begin with , and my friends are very open minded .","284104":"lately , it s been chinese people overall they ve been facing so much discrimination due to the coronavirus , when it isn t warranted at all . just because someone is of a specific race or ethnic group doesn t mean they re responsible for the outbreak , and to treat a chinese person differently or poorly is incredibly wrong . this actually goes for most people of the asian population , because i know some people who have been discriminated against for being asian even though they re not even chinese .","284105":"i just briefly skimmed through an article that discussed the uk contemplating instituting a herd immunity approach to combat the virus , but it was met with a lot of criticism from physicians and virologists . most times , herd immunity is created through a widespread vaccine , but we simply do not have one at this time . i don t know how that would translate in the united states , particularly because the health care system is already f cked and chances are , it would only make things worse . i think social distancing is the best bet in the meantime , and we should listen to medical professionals until they say otherwise .","284106":"three months is a decent amount of time to move on from an old relationship . it doesn t mean he never loved you , because his new feelings towards his new relationship will never negate the feelings he had for you in your old relationship . there are different types of love . my advice is to simply try to move forward , whether it s through finding another partner , spending more time with friends and family , engaging in a new hobby , etc etc . life isn t solely about love and relationships , and it can be enlightening to realize that you do not need another person to feel whole .","284107":"how i met your mother . when i watched the series for the first time , i craved friendships like theirs .","284108":"it s interesting , because i was a night person when i was a teenager and young adult , but as i grew older and started taking on more and more jobs where i was required to wake up early on a consistent basis , i developed into a morning person . i simply feel better when i wake up at a decent hour in the morning because i have the whole day ahead of me and it makes me feel productive .","284109":"yes , i have . i still have your other question in my inbox regarding herd immunity .","284110":"donate it to individuals struggling with a diagnosis of the coronavirus so that they can afford treatment options , as well as donate it to hospitals and clinics so they can afford to purchase more necessities to combat the virus .","284111":"stupid questions don t bother me . i just simply delete them .","284112":"it s made virtually no difference in my behavior . if anything , i have more freedom and free time to answer questions thoughtfully , but i still have the same tolerance as i did before .","284113":"i know that most people want the coronavirus to run its course and be handled , so that they can all return to their normal lives . quarantining seems easy , but we also need social interaction in order to thrive which is why the new zoom applications to interact with friends and family is important ! . in addition , you have to think of the essential workers who are working double overtime , not getting paid any more than they usually would , and are coming into contact potentially with the virus on a daily basis . i know for sure those workers want this to be over with .","284114":"i have a samsung galaxy s .","284115":"depending on each individual s circumstance , yes and no . for those with low incomes , they value money because it s essential for their survival , so they re more apt to hold onto any money they earn in the case of an emergency . in those circumstances , money does not come and go because they cannot afford to otherwise . for some other people , the saying is true . money can come and go , because if you do have a stable job , you re always going to have a reliable source of consistent income . sometimes it s good for certain people to splurge on things because it makes them happy that money will return . it s part of the reason why i like spending money on experiences rather than physical goods .","284116":"hey friends , i m bored af . ask me some interesting , appropriate questions","284117":"evidently my past few responses here have gone unheard .","284118":"definitely not , lmaoo .","284119":"because they re inappropriate on askfm , and i have no desire to make my askfm profile into a s x page .","284120":"ah , so you have no reading comprehension skills and desperate . what a great combination .","284121":"i don t answer s xual questions .","284122":"i skipped a lot of classes my freshman year of college , but i rarely skipped the remaining years . i don t believe i ever skipped classes in high school .","284123":"the highest bidder would be politicians , so no . i d offer it to all clinics and hospitals .","284124":"when my anxiety is rising , i do .","284125":"humans are mammals .","284126":"nope , i have very minimal cooking skills .","284127":"i never studied virology , so i don t personally know . i ll leave that to the experts .","284128":"last night . i had a pretty bad night with respect to my mental health , but thankfully i woke up feeling a tad better .","284129":"are you sure it isn t a typo ? because that makes absolutely no sense .","284130":"i don t believe so , no .","284131":"at a local mexican food restaurant that i sometimes go to during the spring summer months , because they have amazing tacos margaritas .","284132":"uh , i don t have split personalities . in addition , what you re referring to us actually called dissociative identity disorder split personality disorder is outdated and not used by medical professionals anymore .","284133":"i ve been over indulging the past two weeks at least , lol . i m constantly refreshing my social media feeds to see how the coronavirus is affecting different people and how the cases are increasing in new york state .","284134":"it s a subscription streaming service that has television shows and movies , just like netflix .","284135":"i just pretended that i was nauseous or had a migraine .","284136":"i used to do it all the time in high school because i was actually struggling with depression , but it was easier and more understood if i was physically sick .","284137":"i also used to go to the bar times per week when i was in my early s , lol . it s decreased significantly as i ve gotten older , especially now that i m living on my own .","284138":"eh , it s better to be overly cautious than not cautious at all .","284139":"yeah , as long as they re taking necessary precautions . most of my friends are considered essential workers , so they re still going to work every day and remaining safe . people need to remember that it s fine to leave your house when necessary , like for grocery shopping or picking up medication or doctor visits if they re not doing it over the phone . but you have to remain vigilant of your safety and other people s safety .","284140":"i seldom wear makeup to begin with , lol . the only times i ever feel motivated to put on makeup is if i m going out with friends to the bar , which hasn t happened in quite some time . i don t wear makeup to work .","284141":"i don t hate it , and i don t even dislike it . however , i miss seeing my friends having them over to hang out .","284142":"i feel the same about friendships .","284143":"i m undecided on it , because while it s probably fine to take a walk in the park with your pet when you re alone , there have also been a lot of people traveling in groups , which isn t social distancing at all .","284144":"it feels nice to finish work up have a few hours of sunlight left for me to enjoy the day . it s recharging , in a way . quarantine depression is very real , but at least my seasonal depression is at bay .","284145":"i don t really rebel against anything these days , lol . i ve calmed down a lot since my early s .","284146":"the grudge . i watched it when i was far too young it haunted me for months .","284147":"neither ? having the exact same perspectives on every topic isn t really helpful when you re trying to broaden your horizons , but it s also not good if you disagree on every single topic imaginable . ideally , it s best to agree on some things and disagree on others depending on the actual subject , obviously .","284148":"the term insane asylum is extremely archaic and outdated , and its also damaging to people who struggle with mental illness who have been hospitalized . i would rather be placed in a mental hospital tbh i should have been in one a long time ago . i ve been extremely anxious and dissociating a lot lately , and it doesn t help that i just ran out of two of my medications .","284149":"the coronavirus has caused my job to allow us to work from home in light of how terrible new york is right now regarding the number of cases . i haven t gone to the store or really left the house at all in eight days because i don t want to catch the virus . i also haven t seen anyone besides my roommates in two weeks . while in quarantine , i ve thankfully been focusing on work , and in my spare time , i ve been playing video games , sleeping , and watching television .","284150":"taps mic practice social distancing now or we ll all be stuck in quarantine for the rest of .","284151":"sleep , hang out with friends , and play video games .","284152":"i believe not knowing their phone number would be worse .","284153":"is skyrim considered old ? it s almost nine years old , haha . that s a game i can never get sick of at all i ve been playing it since it came out .","284154":"i m always against going through people s phones , so i m not sure if this is the correct way to go about this situation . if you know he is cheating on you for sure , then try explaining to him how you know even though you don t have concrete evidence . i ve never really been in this situation before , so i m not quite sure how to approach the topic . it s a shame he didn t admit to it when you confronted him the first time , but maybe explaining to him that you love him , how you know he s going against you , and how hurt you feel might make him be more truthful .","284155":"i ve always been up front and honest with the people in my life , so if i knew without a doubt that they were lying to me , then i d call them out on their dishonesty .","284156":"no , i usually just tell them i m fine .","284157":"a client from my job , obviously .","284158":"i believe driving in the car should be fine , i have friends who have taken drives just to get some fresh air and clear their heads . as long as you re not in an area where you re supposed to be in your house at all times , at least .","284159":"for some people , absolutely . it isn t for everyone , though .","284160":"no , we understand each other s boundaries and we still wish to be close friends . granted we haven t hung out since the whole coronavirus thing started though , lol .","284161":"no , i ve only since interacted with friends and family like i normally do .","284162":"yes , and i still hold true to those words . him and i have endured significant struggle together and have come out closer in the end , and i ll always be grateful for the support he has given and continues to give me .","284163":"no , i have no intentions of being intimate with someone for the moment .","284164":"we did work on it for a very long time , but nevertheless , things simply didn t work out towards the end . it s a fact of life , and i ve accepted that .","284165":"no ? that would have been inappropriate .","284166":"i don t feel bad or guilty about any of the things i enjoy , so no .","284167":"lettuce , tomato , pepperjack cheese , and ranch dressing .","284168":"i can t stand anything that s too hot , so my ideal temperature outside is in the s and s degrees fanhrenheit . indoors , i usually keep the temperature between and degrees fahrenheit .","284169":"sunday afternoon .","284170":"raspberries , blueberries , and peaches .","284171":"nah , i don t play animal crossing . lately i ve been playing fallout new vegas and destiny .","284172":"as far as i m emotionally and physically willing to go without compromising my own mental health and needs .","284173":"i haven t really learned anything new lately , tbh . staying at home for the past eight days has kept me somewhat in a bubble .","284174":"i m not innately a positive person , but i do try to remain afloat by occupying my time with hobbies and friends , as well as dedicating myself to my work . i enjoy playing video games escaping from reality for a while , as well as reading , drawing , watching television , listening to music , and talking to my friends .","284175":"people talking over me while i m in the middle of speaking .","284176":"i m not eating any more or less than usual , mainly because i still have things occupying my time on a daily basis .","284177":"i d say middle class .","284178":"i know who brittanie is , but we ve never spoken one on one .","284179":"no , i ve never really posted about my relationship on social media to begin with because it s private to me .","284180":"they were saddened but supportive of the decision . i m still close with them .","284181":"the only person i ve ever have a conversation with is svspicion , and idk who brianna even is . lol .","284182":"no , she s white . lol .","284183":"beauty is subjective i don t find myself attractive , so by default most people are more attractive than me , herself included .","284184":"i m anxiety ridden rn , lmaoo . i got off the phone with a client about an hour ago and i m still anxious about it . i absolutely hate talking on the phone .","284185":"working , listening to music , playing video games , and watching television so far .","284186":"i haven t had in depth conversations with her , but she seems quite intelligent .","284187":"easier if i took a photo , lol .","284188":"yes , we ve met on a few occasions .","284189":"i need to color my hair again . it s gotten super light and almost blonde at the tips since i haven t colored it since last november .","284190":"that sounds like a red flag , tbh because it seems like your partner doesn t trust you . i would personally ask them why they d like my passwords to see social media activity , not that there s anything to hide but why they feel so insecure that they want to make sure you re behaving good online .","284191":"yes , i love veggie burgers and black bean burgers .","284192":"years .","284193":"uh , i m not going to document the times i ve used the bathroom .","284194":"i haven t , but apparently linkin park is hosting a band reacts livestream on youtube today with never before seen footage of a concert they recorded in . it ll be one of the first times the entire band has gotten together since chester bennington passed away .","284195":"i haven t been reading more , but i m sure as time goes on , i ll get bored of having the same hobbies and pick up where i left off on the most recent book i started reading .","284196":"i prefer pancakes over waffles .","284197":"somewhat , yeah . mostly i ve been trying to keep up with local news regarding lockdowns , people who have been infected in new york , etc etc .","284198":"you asked me this last night , so i ll talk about yesterday since i only woke up minutes ago , lol . yesterday woke up , made breakfast and coffee . worked from am to pm . did dishes and cleaned the bathroom . made lunch . tidied up my room a bit . watched hulu for a few hours . went to bed around midnight .","284199":"i m not a hugger by any means , so this hasn t really affected me very much in that respect . i m not a physically affectionate person .","284200":"no , i don t and i don t believe i ever have before .","284201":"here s one of the cats i live with . she loves laying in bed with me .","284202":"i wholeheartedly agree .","284203":"no one likes condoms , just fyi . this is something you should be discussing with him , not garnering opinions from random strangers online .","284204":"i don t even know anymore . did i ever know ? how can i know who i am if i have no recollection of the foundations of my own person ?","284205":"no , i don t really believe in that sort of thing .","284206":"well , i don t normally drink tequila but i felt like having a margarita on saturday , so i bought two bottles of ready to drink margarita mix . this is my second glass of the night . i don t even feel buzzed , the alcohol content is only .","284207":"i d honestly probably spend my time doing freelance writing , because i can t imagine myself being without a job . it wouldn t help my mental health at all , and i need to stay busy and productive .","284208":"if i m genuinely happy , then my dimples come out .","284209":"yes , i m fairly open minded but there s always more to be learned .","284210":"tequila . i just poured myself a glass of mango margarita .","284211":"it s been great , actually ! ! i like not having to wake up super early in the morning , i m not being distracted by anyone for a change , and i have two extra hours of free time during the day since i m not commuting .","284212":"thanks , i appreciate it","284213":"i highly suggest you listen to joan jett .","284214":"listen to joan jett .","284215":"i haven t left my house in a week , and i ve been working from home .","284216":"no , lmaoo . that s quite far from the truth . i believe , above all else , that the government has existence of extraterrestrial life and has been using technology for advancements in warfare while keeping everything secret from the public .","284217":"i believe in a few conspiracy theories , and i find them to be interesting in general .","284218":"thanks my day has been fine . i woke up at am , made breakfast , worked until pm , laid in bed for two hours , and now i just ate something small for dinner .","284219":"i m content , but sleepy . i finished up work around two hours ago and have been laying in bed since then . i think i fell asleep for like an hour .","284220":"this is weird , my roommate must be confused or has information no one knows about yet , lmao . i could have sworn he told me new york was implementing curfew from pm to am , but i can t find any news sources to verify this .","284221":"we can leave our homes , but only for essential travel like groceries and the pharmacy . my roommate just got his paperwork stating that he s an essential worker and can be out of the house for work and outside of curfew times .","284222":"there are more diagnosed cases now than ever before on long island , and hospitals are running out of necessary equipment to help patients and protect themselves .","284223":"i m not the biggest fan of jewelry , but i prefer silver over gold . in some cases , rose gold looks nice too .","284224":"here s an photo from years ago of a snowy backyard at my parents house .","284225":"i m concerned for him being he has a compromised immune system but he s an essential worker , so he s going into work every day like normal .","284226":"i m not a member of the cdc , nor am i knowledgeable about virology , so i have no insight into the matter .","284227":"no , they re separate incidents .","284228":"i already know two people who were diagnosed . i also have a friend who was showing symptoms , so she s having herself and the rest of her family tested . i m not particularly worried about my parents because my mother is house bound , and my father has been working remotely from home .","284229":"tbh , that defines the first years of me being in the workforce , lol . i worked in retail customers would constantly yell at me over things out of my control , which was usually demeaning . i always forwarded them to my immediate manager , or if it was bad enough , i would tell them to leave the store entirely .","284230":"nothing substantial , lmaoo .","284231":"the individuals who aren t taking this pandemic seriously are still going out and seeing their friends , loitering in parks and stores , and not taking proper precautions to defend themselves against the virus . if you re otherwise healthy , you have to realize that this isn t about you . you may recover well , but that doesn t mean that the people around you will too . you can be carrying the virus without realizing it spreading it to others , who will subsequently carry it home to their families . it s irresponsible , and it isn t difficult to stay home and only go out when necessary .","284232":"sleep or play some video games .","284233":"a lot of people deflect blame onto others because they don t want to be seen as the bad guy in the story . instead of taking responsibility , they pass it onto someone else so that it doesn t become their problem anymore .","284234":"sometime early last week , i honestly don t remember . i ve been in the house since last monday night with the exception of going to get breakfast last thursday .","284235":"i had a pixie cut when i was in high school .","284236":"i m basically an open book , yes . the only things i don t discuss on askfm are my trauma and s x life .","284237":"writing , editing , photography , and art on occasion . my skills have dwindled in recent years from inactivity , but there are still some drawings and paintings of which i m proud .","284238":"here s my profile pic","284239":"perhaps the ability to report questions on other people s profiles , instead of it automatically reporting the person s answer . there are a lot of people on my friends list who are getting harrassed , and it would be helpful to do so .","284240":"you can try searching for hashtags for those subjects .","284241":"i like most kinds of music , but lately i ve been into alternative and indie rock , hip hop , classical , and metal .","284242":"it varies depending on the individual , because everyone has different interests . personally , i d be fine with going to a coffee shop .","284243":"nobody , at the moment .","284244":"? ? ? he makes more money than i do , lmaoo . we re still friends it s immature to do such a thing . we re both approaching years old there s no reason to play mind games .","284245":"no , that s inaccurate . we broke up over months ago , lol .","284246":"this is assuming that all relationships consist of only men and women being together , lol . in a relationship , no one should be a boss . relationships are supposed to be about equality and understanding among everyone involved , everyone should be on the same level because that s how relationships grow and succeed .","284247":"watching the show pandemic that s on netflix rn .","284248":"depends on the situation . even if you mean well , that person could be on the defense and not want to be bothered , and therefore react negatively to you . it goes on a case by case basis , i think .","284249":"i guess this is a good thing , but i don t really remember . i haven t cried in a while .","284250":"thank you , i appreciate it ! ! i hope the same for you","284251":"i m doing fine . honestly , i m a bit worried because of how high the number of cases are on long island rn , but i m self isolating my roommates have been really good with maintaining distance and keeping up with hygiene . my one roommate works at a supermarket , which has been daunting because he s at the front lines , but at the same time he s also been able to pick up here there things we need to get by .","284252":"i don t wear sports clothes , haha . i normally feel my best in a tee shirt or hoodie with leggings .","284253":"i don t usually celebrate easter , so it has no effect on me .","284254":"no , it s necessary in some places because it will prevent people from going out in crowds and further spreading the virus .","284255":"yeah , i don t believe new york has a curfew yet .","284256":"i m not comfortable talking about this sort of thing because i was ab sed , so it s a tad bit different .","284257":"i love cards against humanity , lol . it s my favorite card game . whenever i would go to the bar in the past , my friends would bring their sets and we would sit at a booth and play .","284258":"so far , so good ! ! i spent the early afternoon just browsing the internet and drinking coffee , but then i took a shower right now i m cleaning the house .","284259":"i didn t know her previously , but i do now . lol .","284260":"i wholeheartedly agree . more and more young people are catching the coronavirus , or at least that s how it appears because now we have more tests readily available . the more tests we have , the more cases we ll find .","284261":"depends on the context , i wouldn t know how i would feel unless it actually happened .","284262":"no , they re both working still .","284263":"we went grocery shopping last sunday , and right now my roommate is at the store picking up a few more essential items .","284264":"yes , he s dating someone at the moment .","284265":"i m biologically female .","284266":"these fetishes are getting wilder wilder .","284267":"i am neither cis nor male .","284268":"yeah , my hands are always very dry so i use hand lotion several times per day .","284269":"in order for me to answer this question , i would have to believe that i m better than someone else which i don t .","284270":"i ve been using computers since i was a young child , so i ve developed fast typing as the years have gone on . i m much faster typing on a computer than i am on my phone .","284271":"i m assuming because they were out in public with other people . my coworker likely got it from our office building because we work with hundreds of other people .","284272":"i prefer salty snacks . whenever i want a snack , i usually grab some cheez its or chips .","284273":"yes , i ve been self isolating since last tuesday when my job announced we were all going to be working from home . i ve only left the house once since then , lol .","284274":"no , quite the opposite . the coronavirus is a global pandemic that has killed thousands of people , and you have to stop and consider how all of their friends and families are feeling in this moment . even those who haven t passed away who are struggling to recover are worried because this is something unlike anything we ve seen before .","284275":"no ? that s pretty racist to assume . people of all races have been diagnosed with the coronavirus .","284276":"yes , i just read that in the news .","284277":"i like them all for various reasons . however , girl interrupted for example is one of my favorite movies because i can relate to the main character a lot , and it s also just a very relatable and entertaining movie .","284278":"i disagree . just because a person is healthy doesn t mean they re immune to the virus , and they can still carry the virus without showing symptoms and spread it to people who are more vulnerable , whether that s family or friends or even strangers . it s in everyone s best interest to continue self isolating . it s fine to perhaps walk around the block , go to the park , etc etc . , as long as you re not close around other people at all more than feet apart . also , tagging her in this since i know you re probably going to copy paste this answer and send it to her anyway . cc sweetnothings","284279":"some of my favorite movies include american psycho , girl interrupted , the punisher , les miserables , sweeney todd , the shining , the lord of the rings trilogy , and heathers .","284280":"the kiss by gustav klimt is one of my favorite works of art , and i also love renaissance and baroque art .","284281":"if the region is under lockdown and people are not supposed to be out in large groups except for essential business , then i believe they should be reprimanded in some way , yeah . it s completely irresponsible to be out for no reason unless you re practicing isolation and walking around the block , etc etc .","284282":"new york state is under complete lockdown , so all non essential stores and businesses are closed until further notice . restaurants are considered essential , but only for takeout and delivery , and no one can dine in anymore .","284283":"he does , yes . we ve been keeping our distance to a reasonable level because he s aware of how i feel about him , and neither of us want to overstep boundaries .","284284":"yes , i still love him . both in a romantic and platonic sense .","284285":"i m scared for my friends who are immunocompromised , as well as friends who still have to go to work every day with the public whose jobs are considered essential .","284286":"my inbox is dry af anyone have any interesting , appropriate questions today ?","284287":"yeah , i keep holding onto the hope that my ex will come to his senses and realize that i was incredibly good for him . nevertheless , you cannot force someone to change their feelings if they do not exist because that s unfair , and i know i should let go of that hope and start moving on .","284288":"yes , there are so many people who aren t taking it seriously at all look at that video of spring breakers who have been partying down in florida , for example . there are also people who believe the virus is a governmental hoax , smh .","284289":"i would much rather live in the woods compared to the rest of these options . living in a big city would make me extremely anxious and paranoid , and i like the woods much more than i like the sea .","284290":"depends on what i want to say and who i m talking to . sometimes i ll just say , hi ! how are you ? and other times i ll dive right into what i want to say .","284291":"i don t remember the last movie i watched in the movie theater , it s been literally years . however , the last movie i watched at home was girl interrupted .","284292":"i d like for people to start practicing social distancing a bit more seriously so that the coronavirus can start declining in populations , and we can all return to a degree of normalcy in our everyday lives .","284293":"i like anti heros like deadpool and the punisher .","284294":"one of them has a weak immune system from my understanding , but the other two have been perfectly healthy . i only saw one of them on a regular basis , she s my coworker and we hung out every day . but she s the one who has not been tested yet , so it isn t guaranteed that she has it or not .","284295":"i m currently playing video games on xbox live , so i m thinking about my friends .","284296":"i ve heard of them , but i ve never tried them before .","284297":"yes , i believe i used to play that a lot as a child .","284298":"black .","284299":"i m not sure what other drastic measures we can take tbh , besides confining people to their homes and implementing some sort of law that repremands people if they re out of their house unless it s to do essential business .","284300":"yeah , i m absolutely fine .","284301":"no , they re my age .","284302":"yes , i actually have two friends who have been diagnosed with it , as well as a coworker who s showing symptoms and is going to get tested tomorrow .","284303":"his family likes me a lot , and we still keep in contact with each other on occasion . for example , i wished his step mother a happy birthday a few days ago . i ve always gotten along with his family very well .","284304":"yeah , in retrospect that was probably a terrible decision . it was also coerced out of me because my mother stalks my social media accounts she always has , and figured something was up to begin with .","284305":"i m . . . not in a new state ? i only live like minutes away from him , lol .","284306":"i never said there was no reason behind it . we just simply fell apart for a variety of reasons , and it has nothing to do with whether or not someone else was in the picture .","284307":"not really , but okay . i ve managed to move into a new house and afford rent , so obviously that means i m not as broke as you think i am .","284308":"they disliked him because he cheated on me once nearly years ago , and they never let go of it . despite the fact that he s been my biggest support system since i revealed to him that i had mental health issues , as well as everything else that has been occurring in my life over the past years .","284309":"no , that wasn t really a factor in us breaking up . needless to say , i did want to get married although i wasn t sure about the whole children thing or not . his feelings just dwindled because we were stuck at a standstill for quite some time , and as much as i tried to deny it , it was true .","284310":"they were supportive of the decision , although my family decided it was the opportunity to bad mouth him . my family was never the biggest fan of him , and it honestly still angers me that they feel so strongly that they were happy that we broke up , which invalidated my feelings . my friends were better , on the other hand . they ve been incredibly supportive .","284311":"we talk nearly every day . he s my closest friend .","284312":"at the moment , i m not sad . then again i m also very tipsy , lol . it s also been around months since we broke up , so i m not as vulnerable to it now as i was initially . after we broke up , i was having meltdowns all the time and didn t think i could live the next day . but i focused on work , on my friends , and i also moved into a new house during that time , so i have a refreshed perspective on life .","284313":"definitely not , lol . like i said earlier , sex isn t important to me at all .","284314":"no , sex isn t terribly important to me .","284315":"i have no intention of dating at the moment .","284316":"we broke up last august , and we simply had a conversation about our relationship and where we were headed . it was a long time coming , we were honestly just putting it off because neither of us had the heart to tell the other person how we truly felt . and it s been very difficult , but i ve managed thus far .","284317":"yes , they were indeed true , and it took me a very long time to gather myself together and try to progress forward after the breakup .","284318":"i m single because we broke up , obviously . we were going steady for a long time , but things eventually fell apart and our relationship was at a standstill . we weren t where we needed to be , he didn t feel as strongly towards me anymore , and we decided to break up and remain friends .","284319":"uh . . . i don t know if you re the same anon as the other day , but my ex s name was definitely not dan . lol .","284320":"i m single , lol .","284321":"no , not yet at least . instead of working in the office , we ve been working from home .","284322":"this image brought to you by skinnygirl margarita mix","284323":"freedom of speech is of the utmost importance , unless that speech is characterized by oppression and discrimination . ideally , we should be able to voice our opinions and concerns and receive productive feedback from other individuals , but considering the state that our society is in now , that s rarely the case .","284324":"i would probably be at a bar or restaurant celebrating happy hour with my roommate and a close friend , lol .","284325":"thank you , i appreciate it . i hope you re doing well too .","284326":"my instagram is private , so no .","284327":"i am single .","284328":"yes ! ! i started hearing it earlier this week . it s interesting it s almost comforting to hear the sound of the ice cream truck amid all of the chaos going on . it s one of the few constants in this changing world .","284329":"totally . in other news , my roommate attempted to go to target this afternoon . apparently the parking lot was filled to the brim , and there were lines of cars waiting for people to pull out of spots so that they can park their car .","284330":"i already drank nearly half a bottle of skinnygirl margarita mix one of the ml bottles .","284331":"my day is going well . i ve literally done nothing except browse the internet and watch other people play video games , haha .","284332":"it would be nice to wake up and make over a k salary per year , lmaoo .","284333":"uh , do you mean fruits and vegetables ? if so , then yeah . . . i hope everyone washes their fruits and veggies before eating them , lmaoo .","284334":"honestly , probably not . there s enough for me to do throughout the day and during my off time i work from am to pm , and i m very much a homebody to begin with .","284335":"i ve been ordering from grubhub doordash on a few occasions , and i m sure that the restaurants are taking the proper precautions because they re considered essential businesses in new york state .","284336":"my day has been going well ! ! i woke up around am , had three cups of coffee , and ate a late breakfast around noon . i ve honestly just been browsing the internet on my laptop for a few hours now because i don t really have an interest in doing anything else . i m currently watching someone play video games on twitch and drinking a margarita .","284337":"my normal routine has changed drastically . i m no longer commuting to the office to work , i ve been working from home since tuesday which has been a blessing . i haven t been going out to the store or to restaurants bars at all , and i ve been ordering delivery instead of going places to pick up whatever i want .","284338":"haha , thank you for asking me my own question i ve been self isolating for the most part . i only went out once since monday night , and that was early in the morning to go to the dunkin drive thru for five minutes . i ve also been washing my hands more frequently and cleaning the house more often .","284339":"at the moment , yes . it s a relief to work from home where i don t have to worry about coming into contact with dozens of people on a daily basis . it s also been nice to roll out of bed at am to clock in at am instead of waking up at am and commuting for minutes in the morning , haha .","284340":"i m usually the one who ends up texting first . if i waited for people to text me , then i probably wouldn t have anyone to talk to .","284341":"not for an entire month , no . at the moment , we have enough to last us perhaps two weeks though . either way , grocery stores are considered essential stores and i can go there at any time .","284342":"not really , no . sometimes there are people i text on and it happens to be daily , but then we won t text for a few days . i don t routinely text anyone on a daily basis .","284343":"quarantinesurvivalkit","284344":"not anymore , no . i m too anxious to be in large crowds . i would rather have a small gathering of friends at my house in a relaxed environment .","284345":"i honestly don t remember . i haven t been to the movie theater in years .","284346":"not really , no . i ll put on some netflix or hulu at night before i go to bed , but i don t watch television during the day .","284347":"yes , i have two planned currently . i want to get a black and white writing quill on my right forearm , and then a traditional style dagger on the back of my right arm .","284348":"they were my favorite band for quite a number of years beginning when i was years old . i still listen to them on a regular basis , and considering chester bennington s birthday was yesterday , i spent the evening watching the memorial concert that happened in .","284349":"if you d like people to follow you , i d advise not to outright ask people to follow you . send legitimate questions out to the people you follow and other individuals , and answer questions on a regular basis . that s how you gain followers .","284350":"still not following you .","284351":"i don t have a genuine favorite because my tastes change all the time . lately , i ve been listening to musicians like grandson , two feet , starset , korn , lewis capaldi , and linkin park .","284352":"you re anonymous . regardless , i don t follow people upon request .","284353":"i usually listen to alternative rock , metal , some hip hop , classical music , etc etc .","284354":"i m listening now , and i m not much of a fan .","284355":"love more than anything else as long as i m stable enough financially to keep afloat . money is obviously important in today s age , but if i have enough money to get by already and didn t necessarily require anymore , then love will prevail .","284356":"ah , interesting . i ve never heard of her before .","284357":"i don t know what that is .","284358":"hello do you have a question ?","284359":"true crime and criminal psychology in general . i find it interesting what sets criminals apart from the regular population , their thought processes , and how their environment growing up contributes to their desire to hurt people .","284360":"seeking treatment for my mental illnesses during a time when i was really struggling actively s icidal , didn t go to work for a week , couldn t eat or shower , etc etc . it totally changed my life around .","284361":"i really like how far i ll go from moana . https www . youtube . com watch ? v cpabx kgcjo","284362":"i m not entirely sure , tbh . on the one hand , it would be nice to live a life that isn t filled with strife , panic , or struggle . however , on the other hand , challenges and obstacles are what make us strong wise , and we learn to grow and evolve from those struggles .","284363":"it isn t wrong to say that it originated in wuhan , china . what s wrong is referring to it as the chinese virus because it s detrimental against asian people who are already facing discrimination . like another anon pointed out , it s charged wording and scientifically incorrect .","284364":"i love ska ! ! one of my friends is actually in a ska band , i see him occasionally .","284365":"whenever i colored my hair last , which was last november according to the picture i posted on instagram , lmaoo . my shaved part has grown out at least two inches .","284366":"thanks ! ! i really need to shave it again though , it s getting way too long .","284367":"i believe i ve had my head shaved for two years now ? i don t quite remember . i shaved half of my head on an impulse . i originally went to the hair salon for a trim and color , and then i told her , hey . . . shave half my head . she went , are you sure ? and i go , just do it .","284368":"a little bit of both . i follow my heart most of the time , but there s also a part of my mind that s screaming at me and telling me that what i m feeling is irrational , lol .","284369":"yeah , that s really racist .","284370":"this situation doesn t really apply very much to me because i would never say doesn t matter , i know what i saw . i would try to assess the situation based on what i saw and also gather input from my partner regarding their perspective on the situation . i would tell them that i was uncomfortable with how they were behaving , but i don t think i would go to such lengths as to break up with them .","284371":"i believe i m living up to my potential . my talents are in writing and editing , and i m thankful that i ve been able to find a job in my field that allows me to apply my knowledge and expertise on a daily basis .","284372":"i believe i was too young to really watch this movie , but the grudge scared the crap out of when i was younger and watching it for the first time . i had nightmares for months after the fact .","284373":"probably the early s , when i was attending school , living life to the best of my ability , spending good times with friends , going on small vacations , etc etc .","284374":"yes , i feel terrible that my previous relationship fell apart . but i m also trying hard to wrap my head around the fact that not everything is permanent , and i m also grateful that we re remaining friends after everything that has happened .","284375":"i wouldn t say i m as far as proud of what i m doing , but i m content with how i m spending my time and my reactions to certain things . i ve been working from home , but i ve also been remaining productive within the house such as keeping up with the cleaning , spending time reading , listening to new music , playing video games , and watching documentaries .","284376":"and with my one last gasping breath , i apologize for bleeding on your shirt . lmaoo . just kidding . i really don t have an answer to this question .","284377":"not seeking mental health treatment sooner . i only sought treatment three years ago , but really i should have done so in my teenage years . it took me nearly attempting s icide in order for me to realize i needed professional help .","284378":"i think one of the best approaches to resolving conflict is to have an open discussion with the other person regarding what the conflict is about . it s important to be communicating and candid about what you believe , as well as receptive to what the other person is saying . you should try to come to a compromise that benefits the both of you .","284379":"from what i ve read , it definitely isn t as bad as how italy is doing right now particularly the death rate . however , if more people do not start social distancing like they should be doing , then it s going to inevitably get worse .","284380":"i m doing fine , just worried about a few friends of mine who are sick at the moment . i have one friend who s displaying a lot of the symptoms of the coronavirus , and she s supposed to be going to the drive thru testing site within the next few days .","284381":"i m very organized and it s easy for me to find what i need to find within my own personal files , whether it s something physical in my house or on my desktop my personal desktop or at work . everything is categorized into different folders and subfolders , normally organized by year and date .","284382":"no , it isn t cluttered by unnecessary things at the moment . i ve been focusing all of my attention on work and my friends , and i ve cut out of my life people who do not reciprocate the same energy as me .","284383":"the dsm v diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder .","284384":"i used to paint a lot , but i fell out of the habit . i still have all of my materials and canvases , though .","284385":"i usually just listen to music and take in the scenery around me . myself and the driver normally just have regular conversation , and sometimes i ll check my phone in between .","284386":"yes , i ve been on medication for the past three years .","284387":"i ve been listening to missio a lot lately , and this song is great https youtu . be ck px

.","284391":"i understand that you re salty . that s just the way askfm is , though . if you don t have a question , i ll just delete things from hereon out .","284392":"that s your decision then . if you don t want to ask me questions , then no one is forcing you to .","284393":"you sound salty .","284394":"i have like unanswered questions in my inbox , so you ll have to be more specific .","284395":"anyone have any questions ? i m drunk","284396":"my ex , two close friends , and one of my coworkers .","284397":"honestly , any of the vacations i went on with my ex and our friends are terrific memories . i don t regret them at all .","284398":"i mean , if it s valid then it isn t necessarily discrimination . it s just a fact at that point . i . e . i ve been sexually harassed on countless occasions on askfm . it isn t discrimination if i choose to ignore a question that i deem to be sexually charged because the evidence is there .","284399":"paranoia is different from discrimination . paranoia is a symptom of mental illness . discrimination is an active choice .","284400":"it isn t discrimination , lol . i have valid reasons to be hesitant to answer some questions from anons if they ask questionable questions .","284401":"no , paranoia is a symptom of my mental illnesses and has nothing to do with discrimination . i m paranoid on a constant basis regardless of who i interact with .","284402":"i don t believe i do anymore . i m conscious of my thoughts and how i express them , and years of reading into civil injustice have taught me how detrimental discrimination is to society as a whole .","284403":"story of my life , lmaoo .","284404":"just because discrimination is common doesn t mean it s good .","284405":"i don t think i have , actually ! !","284406":"because i don t know who the person is or their intentions behind asking the question .","284407":"not to my knowledge , no .","284408":"eh , it depends on what the question is . i m more cautious with anon questions .","284409":"discrimination by itself isn t justified because it means you re not treating someone with equality . there may be individual circumstances where it is justified to put someone in their place , but the age difference usually isn t an overwhelming factor .","284410":"i m a realist .","284411":"i usually see age discrimination against older communities from younger communities . there s also a lot of discrimination toward younger communities from the older generation too , though .","284412":"i m not entirely sure . i have friends who are optimists , realists , and a few pessimists . i try not to associate too much with those who are pessimistic though , it s not inducive to my mental health .","284413":"yeah , i think there s discrimination against older communities .","284414":"somewhat , sure . however , my anxiety usually has an influence on that so sometimes it isn t accurate , lol .","284415":"no , life in general is constantly changing .","284416":"no , isn t old . half of my coworkers are and older , haha .","284417":"i research things online and gather an understanding of what they are before i come to my own conclusion of things .","284418":"um . . . what ? lmfao . i think you re confusing me with someone else .","284419":"i m going by their definitions .","284420":"it isn t a state of being , death is just a

sure . you can believe in different ideologies and align yourself with them while still understanding that society is ruled by capitalism .","284431":"for the most part , sure . i ve had a unique sense of freedom ever since moving out of my parents house .","284432":"depends , sometimes i plan them ahead of time like certain dinners , but other times i m really picky and will choose something at the last second especially if i m not feeling well .","284433":"we live in a capitalist society , so everyone is capitalist to some extent because it s the situation we re forced into

less products for the people who legitimately need those products . there s absolutely no reason for someone to buy packages of toilet paper in one shot .","284440":"no , i don t .","284441":"my feelings of freedom versus restriction were independent of my relationship . i finally felt free after i moved out of my parents house . the support my ex has given me over the years gave me the confidence to keep pushing forward .","284442":"i don t believe i ve ever said that i wouldn t catch the virus . i probably said that i wasn t as susceptible to it compared to other people who are older than me .","284443":"i use honey in green tea sometimes , so yeah .","284444":"students aren t the only people who attend graduations faculty members do , friends do , and family members too . in addition , just because you re young does not mean you re not susceptible to the coronavirus .","284445":"i used to use their shampoo bars and facial scrubs , and i enjoyed them a lot . i don t take baths so i don t use their bath bombs .","284446":"healthy food makes me feel better about myself , but junk food is something i indulge in when i feel like i need to treat myself .","284447":"listening to music calms me down a lot .","284448":"a feeling of admiration for someone in light of their behavior , viewpoints , achievements , and or perseverence .","284449":"they sound incredibly entitled and selfish . spring break in florida encompasses hundreds of people in close proximity to one another , making it a breeding ground for the virus . they re acting irresponsibly , and there s no reason they can t just have a small gathering at their house with close friends in light of the circumstances .","284450":"they won t have the ceremony postponed to a later date ? i understand some people enjoy graduation ceremonies , but it s for the greater good because it s a large gathering of people .","284451":"no , i have absolutely nothing planned . the only thing i m thinking about doing is calling my doctor s office and asking if my doctor can just refill my medication without an appointment , because i m a little hesitant to go to the office .","284452":"no , i ve been working from home .","284453":"? ? ? i m not going to bars or restaurants , or even grocery stores for that matter . i went to the dunkin drive thru in my own car for two minutes , lmaoo .","284454":". . . wut . lmaoo .","284455":"lately , a few hours per day at the minimum . i admit that i m probably a bit addicted to social media at this point and i m always checking updating facebook , twitter , instagram , and askfm .","284456":"i check my personal email once a day . however , when i m at work , i get notifications with incoming emails so i check my work email very often . a significant portion of my day is spent emailing coworkers and clients , it s our primary form of communication .","284457":"i love both cats and dogs , depending on the individual personality of the animal . prior to moving in with two cats , i didn t think i liked cats very much but these two cats are super sweet , lazy , and affectionate .","284458":"if i m outside and i see a neighbor walking to their car or into their house , i ll wave hello . other than that , we don t talk to each other .","284459":"on a national scale i woke up to news that the entire state of california is on lockdown . on a local scale apparently there s talk of legislators freezing mortgage payments in new york , but nothing regarding those who rent homes apartments .","284460":"i love documentaries , and i usually watch the true crime docs that are on netflix and hulu .","284461":"thriving ? dead ? traveling the country ? locked up in prison ? hospitalized ? who knows .","284462":"bidets aren t very common in the united states , no . i ve never used one before either .","284463":"happy friday ! ! i just went to dunkin for breakfast , and the roads were eerily empty around me .","284464":"i wholeheartedly agree . that s why i mentioned how it can lead to discriminatory behavior against asian people in general , on top of the discrimination they already face .","284465":"the spanish flu didn t even come from spain , lol . it was another h n case much like we ve seen over the past decade .","284466":"from my understanding , a lot of major sports have been cancelled in the united states at least basketball , baseball , and hockey are the ones i know of .","284467":"this is true you get what i mean , though . if you re cheating on your partner when you re in a good relationship and you re older than , then that s hella immature .","284468":"i never indicated otherwise . having your sh t together doesn t correlate with being busy , lol .","284469":"? ? ? work , bills , family obligations , doctor appointments , errands , seeing friends , etc etc . i m at the age where i require a partner who has their sh t together , not someone who s untrustworthy and immature .","284470":"no , i have no time or energy to give second chances .","284471":"at the point in my life , any sort of lying and especially cheating .","284472":"there have been myriad illnesses that come from europe , but we don t refer to them as the italian illness or irish illness as examples . the coronavirus originated from china , but it s a global pandemic now . nearly every country has infected people at this point . it s offensive to asian people in particular , because they re facing even more discrimination from it . even if they re not even chinese . calling it a chinese virus perpetuates that xenophobia .","284473":"it varies depending on the person , because everyone has their own individual definition of happiness .","284474":"i m not entirely sure , tbh . i ve always thought of it as a coincidence or just a misfiring of neurons in the brain , but it happens way too often to me .","284475":"it might make people find roads to express their creativity and make new clothing , so possibly ! ! i have a few friends who cosplay and quarantining has been giving them the free time they want in order to work on their cosplays .","284476":"personally , i believe so . it only adds to the discrimination asian people face on a regular basis , and the fact that trump keeps on referring to it as the chinese virus instead of the coronavirus shows how close minded he is and how disconnected he is from the severity of the situation .","284477":"hey friends , i m bored af so send me your questions","284478":"i usually berate myself , so i m probably not the best person to ask this question to .","284479":"the sun setting later relieving a bit of my seasonal depression .","284480":"just explain to them that you love them , in your own words coming from your own heart . everyone shows their love differently .","284481":"i think the character count is sufficient . most questions asked don t require in depth explanation , and it s also important to learn how to keep questions statements concise .","284482":"because they remind me of his personality , in most cases .","284483":"it s part of the snapchat filter .","284484":"i mainly watch psychological thrillers , action movies , dark comedies , and dramas .","284485":"napoleon dynamite .","284486":"what the hell .","284487":"either treasure planet or atlantis the lost empire .","284488":"i d say i m fairly creative , but it really depends on the day and how my mood is in that particular moment .","284489":"new selfie","284490":"yeah , i m missing my ex boyfriend unfortunately . which isn t unusual , but moreso now than ever before because we ve only talked sporadically over the past few days . tbh , everything reminds me of him , lol . certain videos and memes , especially .","284491":"all of the times i ve spent hanging out with friends , whether in the house or around a campfire , where we re swapping meaningful and also hilarious stories until the early morning hours .","284492":"neither ? idk , i feel like i would feel pretty guilty about either of those .","284493":"seeing ghosts in general , haha . i m pretty certain my house is haunted , though . we always joke around about the demon in the basement .","284494":"i m doing quite well ! ! i m currently on a minute break from work i ve been working from home since tuesday , and it s enough to pass the time for the majority of the day . on my lunch breaks , i ve been cleaning the house so that it s less time i have to spend doing so when i m out of work , and it s nice not to have constant distractions like when i m in the office .","284495":"i thought i had slept too late and was going to clock in late for work , so i jumped out of bed in a panic , haha .","284496":"the only gripe i would have would be that there are too many rude , inconsiderate , and invasive users mostly on anon and askfm seems to do nothing about them .","284497":"aw , happy first day of spring ! ! certainly doesn t feel that way outside , though .","284498":"yeah , it was acting up for me late last night and wouldn t load likes or questions . it seems to be fine today , though .","284499":"i don t know who bts is , and i don t like one direction .","284500":"i ve driven in a blizzard before , but i ve never chased storms before . my anxiety gets way too high for that sort of sh t .","284501":"i suppose the most productive thing that has ever happened to me has been graduating from college . moving out of my parents house has also been amazing as i ve been able to work better on my mental health recovery without being impeded by my parents .","284502":"it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live . albus dumbledore .","284503":"new video games that are coming out animal crossing and doom ! , scientific breakthroughs including another person cured of hiv , the return of wildlife in venice , how in isolation a lot of musicians are making and releasing new music , etc etc .","284504":"depends on what you re sick with , or what you assume you re sick with , and whether or not it s contagious . if you feel sick right at this current moment , you re better off staying home in light of the current circumstances .","284505":"there hasn t been any pollen in my area yet .","284506":"yes , lmaoo . i ve been wearing the same sweatpants for two days . quarantinelife","284507":"probably when i was a teenager , sure .","284508":"how i met your mother ! !","284509":"i m not a girl , if you care to read my bio . regardless , i m fine . my lunch break is ending in eight minutes and then i ll have to work for another . hours . working from home has been amazing , though .","284510":"i ve never used a quill before , but i have used a typewriter . i used to own two of them , but when i moved , i decided to donate them as i had no place to put them in my new house . i prefer typing over handwriting poetry and prose , because my mind often races too fast for me to keep up with it by hand . i m a very fast typer , so it s easier for me to simply type especially when i think twice about something and decide to delete it . it s very convenient . i haven t written anything in two months or so , unfortunately .","284511":"i ve drunk texted my ex on a few occasions shortly after we broke up , lol . it didn t amount to anything bad in the long run , but i was totally ashamed and embarrassed .","284512":"no , not really . my life has been defined by change as is many other people s lives and eventually you learn to accept them as they come up and work your way through them .","284513":"my last missed call was from my roommate , and i didn t answer because i wasn t around my phone at the time .","284514":"i don t like frappes from starbucks or dunkin or anything , but if you ever have the chance , get a greek frappe . it s just made with instant coffee , water , and sugar , but it s delicious .","284515":"i have it all in my bag , haha . i should definitely make a change jar , though . . .","284516":"perhaps people irl , people online , and coworkers .","284517":"no , why would it be bad ?","284518":"i can t drink cranberry juice straight , but i do like vodka sodas with a splash of cranberry juice .","284519":"i m friends with two of my exes , so yeah .","284520":"i have family in florida , and extended family in italy . i m not close to any of them though , so i m not sure how it s been affecting them .","284521":"i m just worried about some friends and other people i know who have compromised immune systems and are therefore more vulnerable to be severely ill if they come into contact with someone who s carrying the virus . i mean , i m getting to work from home now , which is pretty interesting . and it s also the right call because i work in an office building with hundreds of other people , guaranteed at least one person was carrying the virus .","284522":"no , the coronavirus is a global pandemic unlike anything we ve seen before . it s why the news media has been focused so much on it and emphasizing social distancing to contain the virus .","284523":"i didn t even realize it was st . patrick s day until later on in the afternoon , tbh . i didn t do anything special at all .","284524":"omg . . . i just saw them now . that s hilarious and a bit weird . i m not entirely sure how i feel about them , lol .","284525":"i believe one of my biggest challenges has been overcoming self destructive habits in light of mental illness , particularly my addiction to self harm which lasted around eight years . i stopped hurting myself at the age of , and although i ve relapsed here and there , it hasn t been a routine habit since that age which is almost years ago . i m incredibly proud of myself for overcoming that .","284526":"i would consider that a little harsh , yes . perhaps you should talk to her about why she s been acting out and doing poorly in school , especially if it s out of character for her . communication with your children is essential .","284527":"when your life , or a loved one s life , is at stake .","284528":"i have too many to list , haha . les miserables , the crow , heathers . girl interrupted , sweeney todd , the punisher , american psycho , and the lord of the rings are among my favorites .","284529":"i m introverted with extroverted features , i . e . i can t spend time with people for long periods of time and i need solitude in order to recharge . however , i also feel at home with small gatherings of my closest friends .","284530":"whenever i use the bathroom , as well as occasionally throughout the day like after eating and whatnot .","284531":"depends on the subject matter , but sure .","284532":"i am neither a baby nor a girl . did you have a question ?","284533":"i sleep deeply and can sleep for hours at a time if given the opportunity .","284534":"i m somewhat comfortable at the moment , but my finances aren t always stable . it goes on a week by week basis .","284535":"how fulfilling the first sip of coffee tastes every morning .","284536":"the cheeseburger and tater tots i had from smashburger for dinner tonight .","284537":"from past to present from the skyrim soundtrack . https youtu . be s sti zbg","284538":"no , being immortal sounds awful tbh .","284539":"lnr i find it admirable how dedicated you are to fitness and losing weight .","284540":"shehitsback i love how expressive creative you are , you re an inspiration . astoldbyjoanna you re a genuinely good soul , and every time i read your posts or poetry , i m filled with lightness . manicmartyrdom i m really happy we ve gotten around to talking more lately , you re a great friend .","284541":"i ve seen pictures , yeah . not sure if they re scientifically accurate or not though , lmaoo .","284542":"you can easily google this .","284543":"so far , yes . i can use the bathroom without worrying about germs , i can work in my pajamas , i don t have to walk very far to get another cup of coffee , and i don t have to commute for minutes there back . i rolled out of bed at am instead of having to wake up at am , haha .","284544":"no , i seldom get colds or the flu .","284545":"i eat bacon occasionally , so yay .","284546":"my office has closed , but we re still working from home . not much has changed besides the environment , haha .","284547":"autumn i like the changing colors of the tree leaves , the chilly weather , halloween , and seasonal clothing and food drinks .","284548":"sex isn t a need , it s a want . if someone wants sex so much that they re willing to betray their partner to solely have sex , then they should either communicate with their partner and come to a compromise or break up completely .","284549":"probably sleeping or reading a book , because i wouldn t be able to work from home .","284550":"pluto .","284551":"no , i definitely don t believe that anymore . that was waaaay before it became a global pandemic .","284552":"they re nosy idiots , haha . no one else s business should matter to you unless it affects you personally . people who pry into other people s personal business are entitled .","284553":"no , i don t watch p rn .","284554":"only time will tell ! ! working from home has been great so far .","284555":"i wouldn t care . i only go on social media websites anyway .","284556":"no , quite the opposite . i believe that then government s precautions are necessary to prevent further cases of covid and it s safer to quarantine people and close schools public places so that people do not carry the virus or infect others .","284557":"i commuted to the office every day , and starting today , i ll be working from home for the next days . public and private schools are closed for the next two weeks across long island , and schools in new york city are closed until mid april . businesses are closing everywhere , and as of last night , every store is closing at pm and every public place that doesn t serve food is closed until further notice like gyms and bars .","284558":"with a giant cup of coffee and a few puffs on my vape .","284559":"i don t like amusement parks in general .","284560":"i don t wear any accessories , haha . i only wear a necklace , which is the same necklace i ve worn since late .","284561":"i prefer rose gold out of the three listed .","284562":"i m somewhat stubborn , but definitely not as stubborn as i used to be .","284563":"no , i just have one regular facebook account .","284564":"no , there s a high recovery rate for the coronavirus . it s obviously a severe pandemic that should be taken seriously , but once every massive country begins to implement quarantine rules , it should realistically get better .","284565":"no , i m in isolation at the moment . i m working from home for the next days .","284566":"it s a lethal virus that has killed thousands of people . . . what sort of opinion am i supposed to have ? lol .","284567":"a cup of iced coffee , a vinyl record , a writing quill , and a film camera .","284568":"i m not entirely sure , tbh . it seems like it s getting worse by the day in every country .","284569":"no , that sounds like a recipe for disaster . there s really nothing good that can come out of dating a co worker , especially if it s in an environment where it s not exactly ethical to date your co worker like , a lot of establishments forbid people from management dating their employees , etc etc .","284570":"i think it s a bit strange , but there s also a difference between actually fighting and then having disagreements . you can have a healthy relationship and have disagreements without fighting over them .","284571":"i m not personally interested in a long distance relationship , so no . if i m in a relationship , then i would want someone who s near me where i can see them on a routine basis .","284572":"yes , i believe in ghosts and spirits . honestly , i think the house i m living in is a bit haunted , lol .","284573":"i think that s a rather popular opinion , actually . i do agree that people in general pay too much attention to other people s business . you should realistically be only focused on yourself and your loved ones , your own progress , your own happiness , etc etc . it s healthy to give some attention to others , especially if you re giving other people a platform to raise their voice when they don t have much of a platform themselves , but if you re so invested in other people s business that it negatively harms you or others , then that s no good .","284574":"i ll be lucky if i m alive in years , considering i can t even envision my life one year from now . i try not to think about the distant future like that .","284575":"i ve been meaning to make an appointment to get a writing quill in black white on my right forearm .","284576":"not sure if this a compliment or not , but regardless , i ll take it as one . thank you","284577":"i m working from home for the next month starting tomorrow . i m excited to sleep in until am instead of waking up at am every day . i have a psychiatric appointment on the th that i ll probably be forced to cancel , so i hope my doctor can prescribe me my medication without seeing me in person .","284578":"i love wolves , i ve always felt some weird spiritual connection to them . i actually have a tattoo of a wolf on my thigh .","284579":"also , that awkward moment when you realize that was literally years ago . weird .","284580":"does lo fi hip hop count ? lmaoo .","284581":"when i m working hard , i don t think about anything except the task at hand and things i need to do subsequent to that task in terms of work related things . i m grateful to have a job where i feel productive every day because it helps with my mental health a lot . i don t dwell on things that i would normally dwell on if i had nothing to do because my mind is focused on my work .","284582":"all the time , haha . thankfully it was never anything serious .","284583":"yes , i forgave them .","284584":"i don t generally eat chocolate , but i used to like the hershey s cookies and cream bars .","284585":"i would assume directly from a store , unless you trust that person . if a friend is selling you an old iphone , then i think that would be fine because there s no worry about it being tampered with . but if it s from a total stranger , you don t really know what they could have done to the phone previously .","284586":"autumn short boots . winter tall boots and short boots . spring short boots and sandals . summer sandals .","284587":"courtneyuwu lmaoo .","284588":"welcome back , bby . ily . everyone follow courtney ! !","284589":"it s currently degrees fahrenheit , cloudy , and dark .","284590":"i m incredibly relieved at the moment . i walked into work this morning expecting the worst i thought the company was going to close down completely , tbh . we plummeted in sales in one week , and people from my department got laid off last friday . thankfully , management gave us all the okay to begin working remotely from home starting tomorrow for the next days .","284591":"because i didn t want to smoke cigarettes anymore . i finished off a pack and decided i didn t want to continue smoking , so i switched over to vaping .","284592":"i suppose more modern ones , considering i seldom watched old timey television shows or movies that are older than the s or so .","284593":"i don t smoke cigarettes anymore , no . i do vape , though .","284594":"no , we already have a decent amount of toilet paper at the moment . if we need more , i can always go out during the day and grab some more now that i m working from home .","284595":"yes , colleges and universities have shut down campuses and are doing remote learning . public and private schools across long island are closed for the next two weeks , and schools in new york city are closed until mid april .","284596":"depends on the gas station , but it s around . or so per gallon .","284597":"i believe it s a good idea in the long run , because sports events usually compose of hundreds of people in such enclosed spaces , and it s a breeding ground for illness . we need to keep civilians , as well as the athletes , safe .","284598":"not usually , no . i used to go out and drink on st . patrick s day , but i ve become quite reclusive over the past year or two , so that hasn t happened in quite some time , lol . the towns are way too packed with people .","284599":"i thought the quote was don t light yourself on fire to keep others warm ? if that s the case , then i agree with the quote . you need to take care of yourself first foremost , and the rest should fall into place . your own needs , whether physical or emotional , are equally as important and you cannot compromise yourself in order to keep others happy .","284600":"i ve never seen either .","284601":"no , i seldom go to the bar these days . i think it s the right decision .","284602":"i m thankfully not out of work . i went into the office today the entire company held a meeting starting tomorrow , we re all going to be working from home for the next days . which works out well , because new york state and i think the tri state area is also implementing a curfew , where they re closing all stores at pm . all public places that don t serve food will be also closed , which means bars and gyms and movie theaters , etc etc .","284603":"i don t even know what a shuffle dance is , lmaoo . regardless , i don t like most club music .","284604":"both sound completely awful , tbh .","284605":"unfortunately , no . i think it s a beautiful instrument , though .","284606":"true crime is one of my biggest interests , especially lately . it s all i watch on television , haha . i also enjoy literature , writing , video games , art , poetry , and photography .","284607":"i don t know if they re unpopular , but they re certainly controversial . . . abortion is not murder . circumcision is g nital m tiliation . gender exists on a spectrum , and there are more than two genders . universal health care is a human right , not a privilege . there should be stricter restrictions on guns no one should be able to purchase an assault rifle in today s age . alcohol consumption is too normalized in today s society . the death penalty is inhumane .","284608":"fairly often these days .","284609":"? ? ? because i want to remain abreast of political happenings . i m curious to see which candidate has to say about pertinent topics relative to our daily lives and global events .","284610":"i like them all equally , they all have separate meanings to me .","284611":"no . i m non binary .","284612":"upper arm , forearm , back , calf , ankle , ribcage , and thigh .","284613":"i have seven tattoos .","284614":"it s ultimately your decision . but i believe it s important to have communication with your partner , so if you want to stop taking birth control then that s something you need to give a heads up to your partner about .","284615":"depends on how close i am to that person . i haven t slept over someone else s house besides my ex in many , many years .","284616":"i assume so , yes .","284617":"i m not a girl as my bio indicates , i m non binary . i m watching the democratic debate between bernie and biden .","284618":"i wouldn t really consider it a favorite or anything because that has a positive connotation , but the one i most often use is telling people that i m fine or that i feel okay . i don t like people to unnecessarily worry about me if i m not doing well .","284619":"no one was allowed on their cell phones , regardless of management status .","284620":"yeah , if it was bad enough you could get written up .","284621":"very much so , yes . lately i ve been experiencing . . . not really flashbacks because they don t encompass my entire being , but i do get sudden flashes back into the past that shake me up sometimes .","284622":"i think it can be seen as careless , yes . when i worked in retail , we were told not to be on our phones while working which is a general rule for almost all workplaces anyway . from a customer s perspective , it appears as if the employee doesn t care or they re too preoccupied to put into their work .","284623":"uh . . . no ? lmao . i have zero children .","284624":"i m not a parent , so this does not apply to me .","284625":"depends on the parent , obviously . every parent , regardless of their gender , will have different methods of discipline and parenting .","284626":"i don t even know how to make my hair into a bun , lmaoo . having long hair is very new to me .","284627":"no , it s down right now .","284628":"vomited into my hands while standing outside and being escorted out of the bar by security , smh .","284629":"i don t feel well enough to drive .","284630":"i don t feel too great today i m very foggy and light headed , even though i had a good breakfast and currently drinking coffee . i canceled plans with my parents they re having people over for dinner tonight and i was supposed to be there , but i don t feel well enough to go over the house . i m not worried i have the virus or anything , but i think i definitely need to relax and calm down because it s been a very emotionally distraught weekend .","284631":"yeah , that s hella rude . you don t sound cocky or arrogant at all tbh , it s your own hair and you have the freedom to do whatever you want with it as you please . if it makes you happy and content , nobody else s opinion matters . and it s asinine that your friends would even go out of their way to tell you it s ugly .","284632":"depends on what you re buying and where you re going . you can get some healthy food from the grocery store for cheap , but then you have to cook the food yourself , etc etc . fast food is a faster , alternative option for people who don t have the time to cook .","284633":"oh yes , i do know this song . i believe it was one of the songs played on the store radio when i worked in retail , lmaoo .","284634":"from my experience , yes . lmaoo . in the past when i was years old , my hangovers would be perhaps one or two hours tops . now when i get very hungover , it lasts the entire day . it s an absolute nightmare .","284635":"i ve heard of her before , but i don t believe i know any of her music .","284636":"yes , that s very common . alcohol is a depressant , which means that it can negatively affect moods when you re under the influence as well as during the aftermath of drinking .","284637":"i ve only ever been that hungover a few times , haha . whenever i get a hangover these days , it s normally just a massive headache with some bit of nausea , nothing wild . even though i m not hungry , i know the food will absorb the alcohol acids in my stomach and that s why i try to eat before going back to sleep .","284638":"no , i ve never heard of that concept before . i think it would only increase hysteria , though .","284639":"i always tell people my foolproof cure for hangovers wake up early , take two ibuprofen tablets with a giant jug of water . eat a bacon , egg , and cheese sandwich i prefer fried eggs with american cheese on a croissant . go back to sleep don t set an alarm . wake up , and you feel back to normal ! !","284640":"happy sunday i honestly feel like sh t today , i don t know why . i woke up after sleeping for like hours straight , and now i feel really light headed and foggy .","284641":"i usually either sleep or play video games , haha .","284642":"i got denied a job from a social media marketing company when i was fresh out of college . i didn t bring my resume to the interview because they told me they had it on file and yes , now i obviously know to be prepared . when i walked in , the manager asked for my resume , and when i told him that i didn t bring it because i had e mailed it to him , he politely escorted me out . i was extremely upset , but honestly i wouldn t have wanted to work for a company that stuck up anyway .","284643":"no , i don t . it also depends on the individual you can t group everyone based on sex or gender into one category and make a blanket statement about them .","284644":"no , i have a lot of empathy toward service workers , especially in retail and food establishments . they re such high pressure jobs .","284645":"i haven t been to the grocery store since last week , and it was mostly paper goods and soap products that were out of stock . i m sure it s much worse now than it was last week , though .","284646":"yeah , usually just ceasar salads though .","284647":"yeah , i ll get them on my pizza .","284648":"cheddar cheese , spinach , and bell peppers .","284649":"i ll eat hard boiled eggs , yeah .","284650":"no , i quit smoking cigarettes last september .","284651":"haha , i think it s a bit of an older phrase so a lot of young people probably don t recognize it .","284652":"? ? ? i ve been active for several years , lol .","284653":"sleeping . lmao .","284654":"good music .","284655":"right now , mango . earlier , i tried one of the new watermelon ones which was delicious .","284656":"i ve never watched that show before , although i ve heard good things about it . either way , i don t have cable .","284657":"i haven t had them since i was a teenager .","284658":"aw , thank you ! !","284659":"if it was offered to me , then i would drink it . but normally my water of choice if i have to buy water is smartwater .","284660":"no , i don t generally use slang .","284661":"i m currently watching youtube videos , drinking a white claw , and waiting for my laundry to finish .","284662":"lmaoo , i m not really a petty sort of person .","284663":"that s definitely not the case , haha . i am a bit jealous , and it does hurt when i see them doing cute things together , but ultimately i want him to be happy . if that s with someone else right now , then so be it .","284664":"i ve always been comfortable spending time with him regardless of the intimacy involved . i don t really know right now if we re better off as friends as opposed to partners , it s something i ve been navigating on a day by day basis . but our chemistry hasn t changed , we still have fun together and have great conversations .","284665":"a large contributing factor was the lack of conflict like i keep indicating , we were stagnant and there was no intimacy there not talking s xually . we acted more like friends than partners towards the end , if that makes sense . people fall out of love it s something that happens , and the only thing i can do is accept it .","284666":"we were together for years . his girlfriend is nice and we relate on a lot of issues she also struggles with mental health problems , but she s also very in your face . from my understanding , my ex s family doesn t like her very much .","284667":"whoops , i meant to type neurotypical not typical . regardless , i was referring to mental illness specifically bpd . he s been my favorite person for quite a long time , so it would be devastating if he wasn t in my life at all .","284668":"we ve been broken up for quite a while .","284669":"thank you , i appreciate it .","284670":"she doesn t know that i still love him , haha . at least to my knowledge . regardless , she s obviously fine with our friendship , and if she wasn t okay with our friendship , then there would be major issues in their relationship .","284671":"i can cope with him dating . just because i have bad nights doesn t mean i m not coping well tbh , i m coping a lot better than i thought i would have . we talk less often now than we did in the past , so there is some disconnection there , but i wouldn t be able to handle him not being in my life at all . other people have suggested the same idea , and that may work with a typical person , but it wouldn t work for me .","284672":"it s been fine so far . i got drunk last night on abv beer , and today i made a nice breakfast , did laundry , and visited my parents briefly . tomorrow , i have to go back to my parents house for an early dinner with some other relatives , which i m not really looking forward to tbh .","284673":"no , i don t believe i can do that . i wouldn t be able to cope not having him in my life at all .","284674":"gender is different from feeling masculine and feminine . you can be masculine and be non binary , and you can be feminine and be non binary or whatever combination of the two , it s a sliding scale .","284675":"what do you mean by still ? my gender hasn t changed , nor will it change in the future because it s simply who i am .","284676":"no , i don t believe he was ever using me . he has always been up front and honest about his feelings , it s not as if he was trying to hide anything from me .","284677":"yes , i quit smoking cigarettes last september .","284678":"this song is so freakin good . https www . youtube . com watch ? v ppqu idh fs","284679":"i just looked it up it s called trading mom ! ! https en . wikipedia . org wiki trading mom","284680":"lol what . i ve legit never heard of this before .","284681":"my unhealthy coping mechanisms need to be changed , it s perhaps one of the things that deters me the most from being the best version of myself .","284682":"my gender is non binary . it s important to me because it gives me a small insight into my identity .","284683":"i don t really feel comfortable elaborating significantly on it , but the relationship just sorta dissipated towards the end . he didn t feel strongly towards me anymore , and everything was stagnant for a long while . i gave off the impression that everything between us was fine , and although there was no conflict between us , there was a lack of intimacy that we used to have in previous years . i m surviving , but i d be lying if i said i was fine . i ve had multiple meltdowns since the breakup , and i still have really bad nights . i have no interest in seeing anyone else , even on a casual basis , and i still very much feel strongly towards him . we re friends still , and we talk very often maybe days out of the week .","284684":"i m going to be honest with you i have zero clue about anything going on with israel or palestine right now . i know it s a hot topic of debate , but i ve never looked into it .","284685":"i m voting for bernie sanders . i ve voted in elections although not really local ones ever since i turned years old .","284686":"i like fried potato skins with cheddar cheese bacon on top of them .","284687":"courtney wasn t ever my best friend , lol . she s one of my closest internet friends , though .","284688":"i honestly don t know anything about that person or that band , lol .","284689":"my best friend and i met in middle school . we sat at the same lunch table , and everyone was talking about music . eventually , we came to realize that we were both interested in linkin park , and we talked endlessly about the band . we became best friends shortly thereafter .","284690":"aw , lol . yeah , i ve had serious talks with a coworker of mine who was going through some serious sh t a while ago and she got emotional over what i told her , but it also made her feel better .","284691":"stay at home writer , particularly a novelist if i ever get the motivation to start working on writing a book , lol .","284692":"i believe testing and treatment should be more available than it currently is so more people are aware of where the virus is escalating and people can take more accurate precautions .","284693":"no , not usually . i ve had a few different usernames on things over the years and they were all relatively easy to come up with .","284694":"i m not going to buy things in bulk . there s no reason for me to do so , i have enough toilet paper already to last me a few weeks and the only thing my house may need in the near future is more paper towels which my roommate can get through his job . we have enough food since we did grocery shopping recently , and we already have a lot of hand soap . buying things unnecessarily in bulk when you re otherwise healthy leaves less supplies for people who actually need them .","284695":"no , i m considered healthy and i m also quite young , so i m not susceptible to falling ill personally from the coronavirus . however , many of my friends and family members are immunocompromised , so if i were to contract the virus , i wouldn t be able to visit or be around them for their own safety .","284696":"everything that i ve stated about the coronavirus over the past few days indicates quite the opposite , but all right .","284697":"they re not sayings or anything , i just talk to my friends about whatever it is they re going through and i offer advice when they need it . otherwise , i just show my support of them , tell them why i value their friendship , and encourage them to continue being themselves and work toward their goals because they re beautiful people and deserve the world .","284698":"i support the legalization and taxation of marijuana . it isn t much different from people being able to purchase alcohol , except alcohol is much more unhealthy for you than marijuana is and marijuana also helps with a lot of medical conditions too .","284699":"yeah , pablo neruda is my favorite poet and i find poetry in itself to be quite moving . i ve written a lot of poetry throughout my life .","284700":"i don t have the opportunity to do it often in terms of physical gifts and whatnot , so lately it s been things like sending encouraging messages and memes to my friends , as well as positive affirmations when they re feeling down .","284701":"yeah , i believe it s a bit selfish and also ignorant to not take it seriously at this point . it s considered a global pandemic , people are dying at alarming rates , and even if you re a healthy individual you could still carry the virus and pass it on to someone else who is more susceptible to falling severely ill from it .","284702":"aw , this is so sweet . thank you so much ! !","284703":"listening to the les miserables soundtrack again this week , after not listening to it for over a year . i forgot how genuinely beautiful and heart wrenching it is .","284704":"that s not weird at all ! ! i love seeing genuine reactions like that from my friends after doing something nice for them .","284705":"yes , i actually saw him on tuesday night .","284706":"thanks for the follow","284707":"sometimes , but other times i think i m rather selfish . i m trying to break out of that cycle of self degradation , though . being called selfish has been instilled in me from a young age so i ve been conditioned to think that about myself , and it s something i ve been working on for years .","284708":"no , s x isn t terribly important to me . but i do need to see my partner on a regular basis , spend quality time with them , etc etc .","284709":"long distance doesn t necessarily mean it only has to be with someone from another country , it could simply mean it s with someone with whom you don t see for months because of how far away they live from you . regardless , i wouldn t be in a long distance relationship . i need someone with whom i can speak face to face and see regularly .","284710":"besides the united states , i visited the bahamas last month .","284711":"i haven t written it yet , so i don t know . haha .","284712":"yes , he s been dating someone .","284713":"eventually make enough money to live on my own , progress further in my career , progress further in my mental health recovery , write a book , travel more often , etc etc .","284714":"i believe it can do both . instant communication such as phone calls and texts and social media can bring people together on a large scale , especially from different countries , and there are more opportunities for education and growth . at the same time , however , i think it can make people distance themselves from close friends and family , especially if someone is sensitive and doesn t receive a text call response right away , they make think that they re not as close to their loved one as they previously thought even when that s not the case at all .","284715":"i would much prefer to lose all of the memories i have now , especially considering a lot of them are terrible memories . there are great memories in between , but by not being able to make new memories , you won t be able to progress forward in life .","284716":"probably such holy texts as the bible , quran , and torah among others .","284717":"either my best friend or my roommate . both are extremely selfless people , to the point where they sometimes compromise their own happiness for the sake of other people s happiness . which isn t really the healthiest thing to do because i do believe boundaries need to be set in order to protect yourself while still caring for others , but regardless , they re very selfless .","284718":"i have long term goals , but i m comfortable with where i am currently .","284719":"well yeah , it occurred within the first two years of us dating . i m still in love with my ex in the present day .","284720":"probably not as much as i previously knew when i was actually taking courses in mass communications , media , journalism , business writing , etc etc .","284721":"my current job is with a publishing company , where i m a writer and editor .","284722":"because . . . i m not ? i have no desire to be with another person right now .","284723":"unless you have an actual question , you can leave my inbox .","284724":"hello do you have a question ?","284725":"no , quite a few of my friends have differing opinions about things from me .","284726":"just because someone is thinking about appealing doesn t mean they re not guilty . he s just trying to receive a lesser sentence .","284727":"there has been talk about his possibly appealing the conviction , yes .","284728":"i don t appreciate your victim blaming here , so unless you have something productive to say , i m just going to delete further inquiries from you .","284729":"i said victims survivors , who can be someone of any gender . women aren t the only people who are ab sed , and there s actually a lot of stigma against men who are ab sed because they re not taken as seriously .","284730":"i don t have a type , and i m not interested in dating .","284731":"a large majority of people do not fabricate accusations , especially when it comes to how many people came forward . accusing anyone of a crime could damage the accuser greatly , including their reputation if they re a public figure , and it brings up a lot of negative and traumatic emotions when discussing it publicly . there s no reason not to believe that weinstein is guilty . i believe victims survivors above all else .","284732":"i used to like pokemon when i was much younger . i collected the cards and played the video games on my game boy .","284733":"not closely , no . i only know much about it based on certain articles i ve read after the fact .","284734":"i hope you re not suggesting that weinstein was falsely accused .","284735":"it brings a lot of closure to victims survivors when their ab sers are convicted of crimes .","284736":"i think seeing people s passions and love for what they do or who they re around is beautiful . when you see someone s eyes light up when they re talking about something they re passionate about , that s beautiful in my view .","284737":"beauty in music , beauty in the arts , beauty in the natural environment , beauty in community , etc etc .","284738":"eh , yes and no . my emotions make me an empathetic person and i can see the beauty in a lot of different things . however , my mood swings associated with my emotions can be hazardous .","284739":"i agree . i never said it was a bad thing .","284740":"accusations aren t as fulfilling as convictions , because you can accuse someone of a crime and have your voice ultimately unheard of the person is not convicted of that crime . it brings a lot of closure to victims survivors when their ab sers are convicted of crimes .","284741":"because he s xually assaulted multiple people , and he could have received a life sentence had the jury found him guilty of predatory s xual assault .","284742":"i don t even remember at this point . i graduated seven years ago .","284743":"he s doing well for himself , and i m happy for him .","284744":"i started out as a creative writing major , but after i transferred schools , i changed my major to communications with a focus in english literature .","284745":"i did , yeah . it took me another semester extra to complete my courses because a lot of my courses didn t transfer over , though .","284746":"i don t really have any regrets at this moment . i think it s useless to think back on regrets you may have , especially if there s nothing you can do to change them . it leads up unnecessary guilt and anger and sadness .","284747":"probably crying to certain songs that aren t even meant to be sad songs , lmaoo . i m an extremely emotional person and nearly anything can make me cry if it moves me enough .","284748":"i believe the biggest risk i ve taken has been traveling back home from my first year away at college in order to be supportive of my ex and his family during a tragedy . i didn t really have a back up plan in mind , i just knew it was something i needed to do at that time . i didn t enroll back in college until a few months later , and i also didn t even have a job or a car at the time .","284749":"somewhat , yes . i believe that in certain circumstances , your love for a person can blind you to their toxicity if they exhibit toxic traits , and you may find yourself justifying their behavior even if it s harmful out of your pure love for that person . a lot of people don t even realize that it was harmful until after they ve broken up or distanced themselves from their partner .","284750":"any time i went on a vacation with my ex is a cheerful memory , particularly when it was just the two of us and we were able to disconnect from technology and social media for a few days and spend time enjoying each other s company .","284751":"i wouldn t call myself vengeful , but i ve also never been in a situation where i ve felt the need to seek revenge .","284752":"no , i believe that their decision to be under lockdown is completely justified . it s honestly the only way to contain such a widespread pandemic like this , and hospitals are already at maximum capacity .","284753":"i m glad he was sentenced to years in prison , but i also feel like it should have been a much longer sentence .","284754":"i m iffy on this situation , because while he shouldn t have pursued someone so young when he was that age , it s hard to call someone a p do when it happened over years ago and was an isolated incident . even though she wasn t technically an adult yet , there are some places where the age of consent is , and at the time , it was probably younger than that . i wouldn t say it isn t a big deal , but i also don t know if it would be accurate to consider him a p do at this time . it was extremely common for these types of things to occur in that day , and people were not as cognizant of predators as they are now .","284755":"i try not to think about the future because it causes major anxiety within me . my old therapist previously taught me how to be mindful of the present moment , which i think is important in regulating your emotions and setting priorities in order .","284756":"i don t believe there s any silver lining to the coronavirus . people are passing away across the globe , italy is under complete lockdown , and i guarantee that flights coming in and out of the united states are going to be barred soon .","284757":"i don t believe i ve ever completely broken an expensive item before . i cracked the screen of my ipad once a very long time ago , but it still worked afterwards .","284758":"i love fish as pets , and they re extremely interesting and complex to maintain depending on the sort of fish they are and depending on whether they re salt water or fresh water fish . i ve had a few fish in the past , and even with watching my ex s fish tanks , you can see their different personalities .","284759":"greed , particularly when it comes to money .","284760":"linkin park was the first band to come to mind because their music changed genres a lot throughout the course of their career . starting out as nu metal , and then they progressed to an alternative rock feel , to sorta like a hybrid pop rock feel . i love all of their music , but i do admit i stopped listening partially after minutes to midnight which is one of my favorite albums . but since chester bennington passed away , i ve been listening to them more and more often .","284761":"robbery or m rder , haha .","284762":"it s difficult to compare the feelings of a father to a mother when it comes to miscarriages . obviously it may affect the father s feelings too , but the reason why most of the focus is on the mother is because they re the ones carrying the fetus , and they probably already developed an intimate connection with them . it can also be a very traumatic experience for the mother .","284763":"i believe that the coronavirus is a huge threat to everyone s safety , particularly those in vulnerable communities . just because you re healthy and young and will survive easily doesn t mean that you cannot carry the virus to those who are immunocompromised , and that s a huge issue . it makes sense for schools to be operating remotely , closing campuses , and for large office buildings to close and events to be canceled . we want to isolate the virus and reduce the number of those infected , especially considering hospitals can only hold so many people . i believe the hoarding of goods is extremely bad , though . people who are otherwise healthy are buying out supermarkets of all of their paper goods , hygiene products , etc etc . , leaving those who actually need them to be in poor shape because they didn t get a chance to buy them .","284764":"yellow , perhaps ? it s my least favorite color , but i would be hesitant to remove any color from the world because of all of the natural environments that boast those colors . yellow roses , for example , are my favorite type of roses .","284765":"you ve gotta be kidding me . or , what the f ck . are you serious ?","284766":"no ? it s classified as a pandemic and countries are shutting their borders to keep the virus isolated . everybody s safety is at the forefront of everyone s minds .","284767":"i only lotion up my arms and hands . everything else is meaningless . my skin isn t usually dry , either way .","284768":"no , i can t be bothered to do that .","284769":"maybe once every few weeks ? it isn t often . this is the last one i took it s also my profile picture .","284770":"that s something they re going to have to handle on their own time the only thing you can really do in this time is go through with your words and promises and support them . re establishing trust in someone is very difficult and you need to respect that .","284771":"i don t know if they have grounds to sue them , but either way , i want to keep my job so i m not going to say anything unless it s absolutely necessary . who knows if they ll turn their back on me too .","284772":"? ? ? if you don t have a question , then there s nothing for me to respond to .","284773":"upper management apparently said that if finances are better by june , they can come back . but honestly , they gave my coworkers zero warning with no respect for their personal lives . they told them today right before the end of the day , and they cannot come back . i m talking to one of my coworkers about it all now , and she said it left a really bad taste in my mouth , and i probably won t come back knowing that the company has no regard for my personal feelings or life .","284774":"honestly , i believe so although i haven t heard any confirmation of it . people are buying less of our programs because they re prioritizing other needs , which is why our sales are dropping .","284775":"i thought i did , but things didn t work out in my favor . only time will tell .","284776":"i don t know the full story , but from what i ve gathered so far , we ve plummeted in sales which has caused the company to make budget cuts , so they had to let people go because they couldn t afford to pay their salaries . but i mean . . . people ? how can you let go an entire third of a department with no resources available for us who remain ? i m not concerned that i ll be let go , otherwise i would have been in that initial meeting . but i m so angry and upset for everyone who was , including a coworker who was essentially my right hand man .","284777":"see above .","284778":"i explained it in more detail in an earlier answer from a few minutes ago . this afternoon , minutes before we leave for the day , people from my department got laid off . people who were genuinely good at their job . that equals out to perhaps of my entire department who are now gone . i m angry . i m upset . i m frustrated . they didn t deserve to be let go , and this entire company is going to fall to shambles without adequate staffing .","284779":"no , i do not believe in horoscopes .","284780":"i think holding online classes is a good alternative so that students and faculty aren t being kept closely together on campus , which will only make outbreaks worse . there are dozens of campuses which are closing and offering distance learning opportunities for students .","284781":"a lot of alcohol , at this rate . i m so f ckin upset and angry at the moment .","284782":"i heard that he called a national state of emergency , but i don t know what else he said about it . i ve been at work all day .","284783":"standard true crime shows and documentaries , such as forensic files , women behind bars , deadly women , i am a killer , etc etc . forensic files is a big one for me because there are like hundreds of episodes , haha .","284784":"lately i ve been listening to music and playing video games more than anything else .","284785":"i m extremely upset , frustrated , angry , and in disbelief right now . my job laid off people in my department alone this afternoon , and it was totally unexpected . we re losing some really good people and upper management made a huge mistake .","284786":"yes , i ll be at work unless they instruct us to work remotely from home .","284787":"i m not excited exactly , but i am happy to be off from work for the next two days . i m planning on doing absolutely nothing .","284788":"yes , my boyfriend well , now ex and i broke up .","284789":"yes ! ! i just found the disc and popped it into my xbox one , turns out it s backwards compatible .","284790":"i have a lot of aesthetic photos of my bedroom , haha . here s the most recent one of a video game i was playing the other night .","284791":"i m all right . i m currently drinking a beer and watching netflix .","284792":"i haven t considered the thought of popularity since i was in high school . in those days , i was known but i wasn t popular .","284793":"linkin park is one of my all time favorite bands , as you know lol . i would choose them in a heartbeat .","284794":"i m fine with any question , as long as it isn t harassment , sexual questions , trolling , etc etc .","284795":"no , i prefer jeans and leggings .","284796":"seeing an email from upper management today , where they basically stated that if you re uncomfortable going to work due to the coronavirus then you can use your vacation time pto to cover the days . which i think is ridiculous , tbh . we re in an office building with hundreds of people , the risk of people getting the coronavirus is ridiculously high , especially considering the amount of cases on long island right now .","284797":"communication . you have to be open and communicating your needs with your partner in order for things to work . there should be mutual understanding between the both of you as you re working towards the same goals .","284798":"i have a personality disorder , so this is difficult to answer . lmaoo .","284799":"probably the terrorist attacks on .","284800":"no , i can t even keep cacti alive . lmaoo .","284801":"listening to music late at night while drinking a beer and just enjoying the moment .","284802":"no , but they unsettle me slightly . i ve only ever been to the hospital for bad reasons .","284803":"no , large gatherings make me extremely anxious and i prefer closer one on one settings , or settings with at maximum people .","284804":"yes , i would be a hell of a lot happier if i won the lottery . i would be financially stable , out of debt , and able to afford the primary things i need to thrive .","284805":"i don t have an all time favorite song , no . my taste in music varies wildly and my favorite music all depends on what sort of mood i m in . one of my favorite musicians is coming out with his album around midnight , though , and i m debating on staying up late just so i can listen to it , lmaoo .","284806":"i promise on bea smith that it will never happen again .","284807":"there s a particular pizza place that s closer to my parents house that i used to order from sometimes , and their pizza was always the best . i haven t had their food since i moved out . new york pizza is always good though , so you re getting good pies regardless of where you go unless you re going to somewhere like domino s .","284808":"a few months ago .","284809":"obviously i believe cheating is terrible , because you re going against your partner s trust and loyalty to you in order to satisfy whatever urge you re feeling , whether it s sexual or emotional . if you re thinking about cheating on your partner , then that s a conversation you need to have with your partner themselves because it s an indication that the relationship isn t as great as it seems . when it comes to people taking them back even though they cheated , i think it can only be judged on a case by case basis , and it s also important to note that we re not really in any position to judge other people or their decisions . some people could be in ab sive relationships and they re acting out of fear .","284810":"skin picking dermatillomania . it s wrecked havoc on my life for years upon years , and i m littered with scabs and scars all over my body .","284811":"there are many men who are skinnier than me , and guaranteed there are also men who are weaker than me even though i m weak af , lol . people shouldn t be categorized in stereotypes .","284812":"i love making bacon , egg , and cheese sandwiches in the morning , even though they re hella unhealthy , haha . bonus points if it s on a croissant .","284813":"writing , playing video games , reading , watching netflix or hulu , painting and drawing , and photography .","284814":"i haven t been to therapy in months unfortunately , but my medication has been my primary form of management for at least three years now . i also try to fall back on healthy coping mechanisms , i . e . listening to music , playing video games , and venting to friends .","284815":"you re going to need to give me more context because this could mean a plethora of different things .","284816":"i like questions pertaining to mental health , music , video games , writing , literature , my own hobbies and education and career , controversial opinions , etc etc .","284817":"lately because of the vip program , i ve been receiving a lot of random questions from users that can apply to a general audience . which is nice for a change , instead of logging in and seeing a bunch of anonymous nonsense lol .","284818":"i would say that i m talented in writing , but there s also always room for improvement .","284819":"i m currently just enjoying being in the house alone , listening to calming music , smelling the scent of the candle burning , and browsing the internet .","284820":"that sounds awfully selfish , tbh . if you re having trouble in the bedroom with your partner and or you re not sexually compatible , then that doesn t justify cheating on your partner .","284821":"i just delete their messages or questions . there s no use in entertaining a troll , they feed into it and your commitment to responding to them , and it isn t worth the energy or time .","284822":"all of the sex based questions are always aggravating , especially considering i ve made it clear time time again that i don t answer questions of that nature .","284823":"well school distracts and colleges are closing that doesn t mean there won t be online classes and remote learning , though .","284824":"they probably don t actually love you as much as they insist that they do if they re willing to put your trust and emotions on the line .","284825":"i m assuming it s when numbers begin to decline after enough quarantine periods .","284826":"not necessarily , no . having a mental illness and lashing out at undeserving people are two different things . the person lashing out is certainly inconsiderate and brash , but that doesn t mean they re mentally ill .","284827":"i would say that s more privileged than shallow . you can always postpone your trip .","284828":"i believe that s a stereotype and that a person can be a cheater regardless of their gender , it has more to do with their personality and insecurities than anything else .","284829":"october or november . i don t prepare for christmas very much ahead of time , and these past few years haven t been big christmases anyway .","284830":"it already has . the stock market has plummeted in the united states alone , and there are other countries who have it much worse than the united states does at the moment especially china and italy .","284831":"no , i believe it s an intelligent thing to do . school districts and colleges are closing on long island where i live , and i think it s smart to try to contain the virus instead of having carriers of the virus spreading their germs in such small public spaces .","284832":"obesity and being unhealthy aren t directly correlated to some degree , and i m with the understanding that everyone s body chemistry is different so we cannot collectively take a stand without understanding the nuances of obesity . being overweight and obese is a concern because it does lead to further complications , especially musculoskeletal and heart problems . but just because a person is overweight doesn t necessarily mean that they re unhealthy they could have absolutely normal blood charts , have a good diet , etc etc . i understand the love your body rhetoric , but i also understand your perspective that it can also be harmful in particular circumstances as it may encourage people to engage in unhealthy behavior .","284833":"yes , i touched upon this perhaps minutes ago or so in a previous answer . the media likes to report the bad news , not necessarily the good news , so there s over reporting on all of the severe illnesses and deaths associated with the coronavirus as opposed to the thousands of people who have recovered . on the one hand , i m concerned since this is officially deemed a pandemic now , and it s almost impossible to contain it unless everyone is quarantined . people with compromised immune systems are susceptible especially , which is concerning in itself because a healthy person could carry the virus without knowing and pass it on to someone who cannot handle the virus . but overall , the mass panic and hysteria is ridiculous among consumers . buying cartfuls of toilet paper and hygiene products , etc etc . this is harmful because it s leaving less product for those who actually do need them .","284834":"because i am not in a relationship , and the object of my affection does not return the feelings .","284835":"lol . i m sorry , i totally forgot .","284836":"i prefer clothing that is too big . i m self conscious about my figure and my weight , so i usually buy shirts on the larger side to begin with .","284837":"i like both classical and jazz music .","284838":"ah , that s awesome ! ! i don t use reddit , so i wouldn t have known , plus i was at work at the time most likely .","284839":"i agree that the reason askfm is implementing these sorts of changes is because they want to liven up the site . activity did decrease for a while , so they introduced incentives to keep people active . i don t really think it s pointless because it is making people ask more questions , but i do think it s ridiculous that they re offering the option to use real money to buy coins , lol .","284840":"i ve never had braces , so i wouldn t know from personal experience . however , that sounds normal because they re essentially a foreign object in your mouth and it ll take some time to get used to the feeling .","284841":"bob s burgers and king of the hill .","284842":"it s remained the same overall . although i am getting more questions from reputable users who need to fulfill their vip requirements , which is nice .","284843":"i go to the dentist , but i ve never had work done before besides usual cleanings .","284844":"there s a docu series on netflix called i am a killer , and it s basically a series of interviews with a murderer as well as their family and friends about what had happened , and most of the people are on death row . i m always a sucker for anything revolving around death and crime , so it immediately caught my attention .","284845":"shehitsback urlsareshittbh kittiemeowsie astoldbyjoanna asgardarts","284846":"not sure it can be classified as a dish , but i love caprese salads .","284847":"i splurged on an iced matcha latte with soy milk this evening after work .","284848":"it depends on my mood . i listen mostly to alternative rock and nu metal , but i also like indie rock , classical music , hip hop , jazz , the blues , metal , pop , etc etc .","284849":"i ve been noticing less people on the roads as i commute to and from work , probably because some workplaces are closing and school districts are closing in light of the threat of the virus . there are dozens of confirmed cases on long island right now .","284850":"as much as i want to like black coffee , i cannot drink black coffee because it s usually too bitter for my liking . i like my coffee to taste obviously like coffee , but i also put a little bit of cream and sugar in it as well .","284851":"i only know of a few bands that could be classified as symphonic metal , and they re pretty all right . it s not my favorite genre of music , but i can tolerate it .","284852":"not really , no . i ve never seen an opera before , but it doesn t appear to be something i would be interested in .","284853":"i just answered a similar question a few minutes ago . in short no , i m not afraid of the coronavirus . i m young and relatively healthy , so i know that it won t personally affect me very much . however , i also realize that everyone should remain vigilant about their personal hygiene and avoiding crowds because a healthy individual could be carrying the virus without knowing , and then subsequently spread it to someone who is susceptible to getting severely ill .","284854":"my favorite video games are skyrim , the fallout series particularly fallout and , destiny and destiny , halo reach , stardew valley , the jackbox party pack , ultimate chicken horse , speedrunners , gta v , the wolf among us , life is strange , assassin s creed syndicate , and the bioshock series .","284855":"a hot cup of coffee or tea in the evening after i get home from work . or if it s a really stressful day , i ll grab a beer from the fridge .","284856":"i ve had near death experiences on quite a few occasions , and it only made me more s icidal .","284857":"still very much a , to my dismay .","284858":"i don t generally like celebrating my birthday in a generic sense , but i ll usually get together with a few close friends .","284859":"hell fuckin yes . i absolutely love ranch dressing , lmaoo .","284860":"how i met your mother , parks and recreation , it s always sunny in philadelphia , criminal minds , ncis , ghost hunters , paranormal lockdown , the x files , bones , castle , you , and forensic files .","284861":"no , the world wouldn t be better off because the substances would not be regulated , and people will be forced to purchase them off the street and face the risk of contamination .","284862":"i absolutely hate mustard yellow .","284863":"i ve never watched black mirror before , but i ve heard from others that it s a terrific show .","284864":"i ve never watched the walking dead before , although people have recommended it to me countless times . i read the first few comics and played some of the video games , though .","284865":"i was born in november , so my birth stone is topaz .","284866":"i like questions pertaining to my life and my interests , such as video games , art , writing , literature , true crime , mental health , my career and education , etc etc .","284867":"no , i ve never attempted string art before . all of the art i ve created in the past was done with acrylic paint , oil paint , watercolors , pastels , colored pencils , charcoal , etc etc .","284868":"i enjoy white peach sangria i once made a sangria with peaches , white wine , and raspberries . i m not much of a fan of sangria made with red wine , though .","284869":"my sleep schedule isn t very consistent , so it depends on the night . some nights i go to bed as early as pm . last night , i went to bed around am .","284870":"my star sign is scorpio .","284871":"iced coffee is my favorite drink . if it didn t dehydrate me so much , i would literally drink it all day .","284872":"i can only drink orange juice in small batches , otherwise it upsets my stomach .","284873":"yes , i wear jeans most days out of the week . i wore jeans and a hoodie to work today .","284874":"winter is my second favorite season following autumn . i like the cold weather , the scent and sight of snowfall , and having the ability to layer up in cozy clothing .","284875":"i enjoy the long hours of sunlight , but i dislike how hot and humid it gets where i live during the summer time . i prefer spring and autumn .","284876":"i ve never used a mac before , so by default , i would choose windows .","284877":"you are a girl . . . no , i m non binary . you behave like a girl . . . behavior does not define gender , and you don t know how i behave . your assumption is invalid . my gender is different from my sex , and even so , i wouldn t be a girl because that refers to people who are not adults . if i was cis , i would be a woman .","284878":"i own an ipad , but it s probably eight years old at this point .","284879":"not with the state of the world as it is currently , haha . i m extremely lucky that the cruise i went on wasn t quarantined a few weeks ago .","284880":"not really , no . it was just an average day at work .","284881":"i wake up around am every day .","284882":"no , i don t watch or even like any sports really .","284883":"yeah , eggs are among my favorite foods .","284884":"pretty sure someone asked this same exact question out to other people only a few days or weeks ago . i only recently deleted it from my inbox .","284885":"no , lmaoo . we had terrific chemistry up until the end and i m not anything special .","284886":"i always found it interesting how the book and show both emphasized what was going on through his head , and it makes readers watchers question themselves because he s such a charming character that his thoughts appear almost rational at first .","284887":"i watched the series and also read half of the first book so far ! ! i love the television show and i m really enjoying the book right now .","284888":"mental illness and intelligence have no correlation .","284889":"he broke up with me , if you want to get technical about it .","284890":"i don t know much about it , but i m fairly certain physicians aren t allowed to diagnose or treat themselves . it isn t necessarily illegal , from my understanding , though .","284891":"today . my parents have been cleaning out the upstairs of their house to remodel everything , and they gave me a box of old things of mine that they found , including old cards from my ex and other various memories .","284892":"driving in general , both driving my own car and then having to watch out for other drivers who aren t driving safely . i ve had driving anxiety for as long as i can remember , and i wish i didn t have to drive anymore .","284893":"probably when i was younger , but obviously i wouldn t remember that .","284894":"yes , because there are some people who enter relationships that are entirely wholesome and their relationship lasts them for the rest of their lives . obviously every couple will live through issues , and communication is paramount . happiness isn t always guaranteed and there will be difficult moments . but those happily ever after couples persevere and are able to retain that happiness even through the difficulties .","284895":"i just took a three hour nap and feel like i wasted my entire afternoon .","284896":"my mental health . i ve been going through a lot of bad days lately , and it s getting tiresome . i just wish sometimes that i didn t struggle with mental illness , ordinary events seem so much more amplified and worse when it comes to my mental illnesses and i m tired of the ups and downs .","284897":"i don t meditate . i ve only successfully meditated once in my life , and it was very tranquil and eased my anxiety greatly .","284898":"all the time , tbh . i m convinced sometimes that my friends dislike me and they re only friends with me because they feel obligated to , as if they re afraid i ll do something bad if they discontinue the friendship .","284899":"quite the opposite , actually . it s pretty common for people with mental health issues and neurotypical people as well to avoid true crime documentaries and shows because it increases their paranoia ."}}
