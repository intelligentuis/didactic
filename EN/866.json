funny at all , it was just dumb . and i didn t like us by jordan peele it made no sense to me . . . it was just way too abstract , and a lot of things never came together . he focused too much on trying to send a message thru the movie that the plot didn t actually make much sense . i was expecting much more from him after seeing get out . harry potter and the goblet of fire it was written poorly . the director was trying to compete with the previous director so tried to make the movie nothing like the one before , and complained that the book was too long . then he made stupid choices like lengthening the st tournament with the dragons which was horrible , revealing that madeye wasn t madeye right off the bat , making the france school all girls and the hungarian one all boys , cutting out the quidditch championship match , making fleur the only triward witch a wimp in the maze , and letting like every single male in the cast have their hair long throughout the movie . harry potter and the halfblood prince it just strayed from the original story so much , which wouldn t have been bad , if they hadn t just made it worse . captain america the first one had no character development . cap was just the same person throughout the whole movie , just bigger after about half of the movie . he didn t even need to practice or learn how to use his super strength , he just popped out of the experiment knowing how to throw the shield and protect everyone already . iron man what the hell was even going on . . . . ? inception it was just sooo boring interstellar gravity i

m not supposed to try . i think they are good for people that need to diet for their health or want to diet , but i think that everyone s body should be excepted and that one does should not have to

cw . . . . . rn , i think my fav show of all time is still parks and rec . . . . i really enjoyed the first half of batwoman tho and it was my favorite show for a bit until spoiler alert julia started flirting with sophie and they got together and it was just so messed up on every level you would have to watch to know why , and then i was hurting so bad for kate for numerous eps to the point where the show just got depressing . and now ruby rose left and caroline is refusing to recast apparently , but instead wants to create a whole different character which messes up the show completely . . . . it s all just disappointing , so my fav show got ruined within a short period of time . . . . i have also recently been liking watching survivor s remorse . it s very funny .","801438":"not entirely sure what the main plot would be . . . . , but the main character would be a black lesbian woman and if they did end up falling in love , it would be with another black lesbian woman . . . . we don t see that enough on tv so we need it . and it would probably involve some supernatural powers of some sort like superheroes with supersuits and shii or magic or sum . but in every other way , i would make it as realistic as possible . if it didn t include any supernatural abilities , it would probably be some kind of movie that includes a lot of dance , but idk what .","801439":"it was an

the best problem solver . i have talked to many strangers online before bc i have no life , and a lot of them either aren t very talkative or good at keeping a conversation going , or specifically guys only wanna talk about getting into relationships and or porn , and want me to get dirty or at least send them lots of pics of myself . then that just becomes stressful and more depressing . . . . plus , i think it s hard to imagine others will understand your problems bc everyone has such different lives . but i think that if you get to know someone for a bit and then start opening up about your problems , it s more likely to be helpful than just spilling everything to a complete stranger . that way , you know them a bit . . . i ve talked a to few people about my problems like that

follow this morality , and then all that results in , in others feeding off of them until they are no longer . people take advantage of you when you are too nice to them . the problem the people who are too nice can t help it . it s just their personality . the world is always gonna be f cked bc it s split into the people feasters and the givers","801922":"text message i guess , bc that s the
