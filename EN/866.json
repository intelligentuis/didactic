I went for a short run to get all the anxious energy out of me, then I took a shower with the lights off but I lit some candles and listened to my most chill and dead playlist, then I made myself some food, and then took a nap for 40 minutes. Didn\u2019t really go on my phone or do anything that would take up mental energy for a whole like 2 hours and was able actually really reset my mind and body and then went out and had a great night \ud83e\udd73 some quick points: 1. i don\u2019t know where that 4th pic came from I think in my friend group chat we were all sending selfies lol 2.

We met at digi fest and I was like 13 at the time. Kian was apart of O2L and I used to be super shy, shyer than I am today. So I literally wasnt all talky talky. But he wasnt just at digi fest to hang out he was also a performer who also happend to be staying in the same hall as us. At the time I only associated with my sisters, our ex friend ryan beatty, and Andrea russett. As the tour went on we talked more and hung outside just being random.. Came to find out kian and I had a lot of things in common amd eventually we became friends. He was in a video of ours as well and through a banana through the window. In 2015 I was JCS summer crush as I put it and will never forget the day JC ( we were kids at the time) but asked me to marry him (ring pop wedding anybody). Through the years if living in california  we always hung out and just had a good time. He's my best friend till this day, always there for me, supporting me, and loving me. We get a lot of people who want us to be together but I don't think that will ever happend and if it does well hello heaven I guess ahah but hes literally like another brother to me and I'm so glad I met him, just an amazing person to be around and cherish\n  ","930207":"\n  Whose a better friend duo \ud83d\ude02\n  ","930208":"\n  I found it \ud83d\ude0a\n  ","930209":"\n  #Rauren\n  ","930210":"\n  Can someone find the photo with jude in chicago\n  ","930211":"\n  My mom said going back to an old relationship is like watching a movie you already seen and expecting a different ending each time\n  "}}
