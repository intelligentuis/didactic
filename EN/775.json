. people have their reasons why it s okay for them and others why they don t like it . either way , it seemed to shock you , in which i recommend talking to him about . ask questions , after all , he s not only your boyfriend , but his own separate person who thinks , behaves , etc , differently than you . if you have q s , ask him . however , you must also accept that this might lead into other discussions about other parts of the relationship . accept many alternate outcomes before jumping into a topic that can get dramatic . i don t know how long you both have been together , but what i do know is that the sooner you express your feelings the better . you don t wanna be sitting in them . now , you might get a response back from someone accusing you of being insecure , as porn in relationships is such a personal thing . sometimes yes , it is because the person is insecure , but other times , just like anything else , it s just because you don t like it . your moral or values go against it and that s okay . it s all okay . but nothing will happen if you don t make things happen . sit with how you feel before you talk to him . how important is this to me ? how am i going to react if he has a bad reaction ? you do what s best for you though . every time .","717033":"next to my heater","717034":"mine only worked when i had no questions in my inbox .","717035":"sho did !

day i m probably not going to able to walk up the stairs anymore so i m taking advantage of the years i have left lol","717539":"yes","717540":"yes","717541":"well so many reasons . when i studied childcare , we talked about nature vs . nurture and just how many factors can alter a child s existence . i feel like it s the same with adult relationships . first , we were all children once so we grew up different off the bat from varied living situations , people who showed up , people who didn t . . . then we grow up , and enter into other people s worlds whether it s for a short time or a long time , taking away lessons , physical items , and even mannerisms . we are always changing our age , who is in our lives , where we live . relationships are hard because it s usually very separate lives coming together . . and that s a lot of experience to pack into one place ! learning how to navigate each other can be difficult at times ! i hope that made sense ! maybe this was more rhetorical , but i found it interesting","717542":"i have not","717543":"there s this absolutely gaudy hat that my husband got . it s so bad . . . but it s the thought that counts . it s actually quite warm too so i wear that one , even though i look like a goober lol or i wear this grey beanie that says dope","717544":"i like the rainbow lights outside on the house and the warm white inside because the colors can get to be a bit much for me .","717545":"only once . i learned from that mistake .","717546":"yes","717547":"literally eating a bk burger","717548":"the future","717549":"i don t lol i distance myself . i don t need that negativity in my life .","717550":"live on what ? tv ? social media ?","717551":"go through more boxes and get rid of stuff","717552":"uhhh well i guess prove it over time . actions speak louder that words .","717553":"i got you . i have had anxiety panic attacks since i was a child . first , you gotta make a kit of some sort so when it happens , everything to help you is in one place . or just throw everything in a backpack stress relief drops . i take rescue remedy drops by bach . some sort of calming essential oil scent , roller or bracelet you can use to smell . it helps . especially in labor but that s not something you need to worry about lol they recommend lavendar , but i m allergic . . just find some that you find pleasing . something cold on the back of the neck is also relieving for me . look up breathing techniques and practice them so you don t forget next time an attack happens . i usually write myself a note , don t forget your breathing ! find a focus object while you are doing your breathing or close your eyes and try to visualize something you find calming and happy . pressure points are a big thing for me . i find that ears are a hot spot . have someone or yourself massage up and down your ear , as there are many pressure points on your ear that relieve stress , pain , what have you . i rub on my ears for many reasons . it s also comforting . natural muscle relaxation . start with your toes and mindfully relax each body part moving up . i was told to go from up to down , but i find that if my body isn t relaxed first , my brain definitely won t be until then . i like mantras . i ve memorized this one https youtu . be wizqghmn u i ll repeat it whenever i need it . sometimes just in my day to day when i need some grounding , healing energy . hydrate after . very important . it s very stressful to the body , obviously . take a shower or bath afterwards to relax your muscles even more . having an attack is very straining on your body . with all this , it s very personal , as we deal with ourselves how we see fit . . . . . but i hope at least one of these suggestions finds you relief when the time comes","717554":"i would love to know too . i got meds for that .","717555":"lol yeah i was asked a couple months ago .","717556":"i feel like it would kind of be the same

that you can bet if i have a few months to go home and i can find a good time for you and your friendship and your family is the same as the last one we had in the first time and was just wondering what you thought about the pizza place for me and i to get some food and staring out the window for a few minutes while i was at the moment i got to the bathroom and then you got to the bathroom door and then you were famous for it was the last thing you had a dream in the name a cow was a toddler that had been a long day after the birth at the moment is the best way for us eating and how to eat the fish in a container that we can eat and to cook for about an only hour of the year old or so old that you can bet if you re not going through the process and then you need for a few months to get my groove on and how much you can afford for me to keep notes on your sleep and i hope you re having an emergency and i don t know what you are going through but you can bet if you re not going

children . maybe both . if you are uncomfortable with the act of stripping for money or any other kind of profession such as this , before you start dating , a good first question would be , what do you do for a living ? if she was hiding it , i would ask about it , supportively , and we d have a discussion about it and how we both felt about her career choice now being out in the open . i would then ask what i could do to help her to feel more comfortable about the situation , and if there was anything else she wanted to get out in the open .","717636":"all of it","717637":"anything .

situation also makes it harder for men who are being abused to speak up openly without judgment . the only people who will truly know what happened between them is them , but i have looked at what has been said , and i have read the opinions of others online about confusing parts in her story which i had also agreed with . in short , i think she s to blame but is getting off easy because she s a
