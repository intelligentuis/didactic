towards you so when that person leaves it feels like hell and back . also when you fall deeply in love with someone who might feel the same at that time but then changes and doesn t feel the same anymore is when you get the most hurt . the ability to feel deeply sometimes hurts so much and causes so much sadness and stress to be honest .","835439":"yes i absolutely agree with this statement because when you look into someone s eyes you can understand their emotions and sometimes thoughts .","835440":"i m a very shy person and i ve literally tried every method and it hasn t worked for me . i just think i m to socially anxious and nervous to break out of it honestly . but here are a few methods you should do what you can , but accept you may not be able to have the kind of conversation you want with them don t take their quietness personally don t ever comment on how shy or quiet they seem take the lead in the conversation but don t overdo it give them a few minutes to warm up to you build their self esteem use their name affirmations explore their interests offer to help them","835441":"i hear it from him every single day and that s what makes me extremely happy","835442":"well being mentally connected with someone means sharing the same interests , similar intellect , and chemistry . mentally you re able to feel close to them and you re able to understand each other well . it also means to have a shared perspective of the world , the fell as if the other person thinks at the same level as you . yes , i think it s incredible if you re able to have a mental connection with someone because in that way you re able to talk to them freely and understand one another so well . you will also feel connected to them even if they aren t physically with you . you will also be able to understand each other s needs which is amazing .","835443":"edraegen","835444":"well yes i ve seen guys call girls dudes . i think anyone can say it to a girl or a
