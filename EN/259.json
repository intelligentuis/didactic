The creation of the charms, along with their destruction and recreation over the ensuing years softened the veil of reality that separates our dimension from the Ledger Domain.

Target did the same soon after, and as different as fans view the latest series, the toys just weren't different enough from the older series for the retailers' taste.\n  \n  I hope the later series of figures I saw makes it to retail in some form, there were some great characters there.
