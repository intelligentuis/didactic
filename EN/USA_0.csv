  لقد قرَّرت أن يكون العِقاب أشدّ قسوة مما تظن، قررت تجاهل وجودك والتأقلم على غيابك كما لو أنَّك لست هنا، التجاهل يا عزيزي أشدّ قسوة، التعامل بـ حرية وعدم وضع لوجودك أي اعتبار، لست قاسية القلب لكن قسوة الأفعال هي من جعلتني أصل لهذه المرحلة، أتعافى منك في وجودك، أن تكون أمامي فـ لا أراك، أفتعل كل وأي شيء لتجنب الحديث معك، لا أهتم كثيرًا بتصرفاتك مهما كانت مزعجة، لا داعي للعتاب فأنا لا أعاتب الغرباء، لا داعي للمناقشات فأنت محق دائمًا، قررت ألا نفترق في توهج خلافتنا فالعلاقات التي تنتهي بهذه الطريقة ربما تعود يومًا وانا حين أرحل لا أعود أبدًا لذلك قررت أن تنتهي علاقتنا بالتجاهل، ببرود تام

   علاقتي بالآخرين لم تتجاوز يوماً كونهم آخرين، أتحدث مع الجميع، أخالطهم، يحدث بيننا الكثير لكن إن انتهينا من هذا يعودون غُرباء، وأعود وحدي، لم يصل أحدهم يوماً لأكثر من ذلك، وهكذا...

   لڪنكّ لا تُدركُ معنى أن يُحبڪ شخص لمَ ينوِ على ذلك قط، شخصُ يُبتلى بحبك على حين غفلة منه، يُصابُ بك فيُحبكَ كأنهُ لم يفعل مُسبقاً، لا تدرك معنى أن يهتم بك شخص رغم أن ظروفه لم تكن تسمح له مُطلقاً، أن يُقدُم الكثير رغم أنه لا يملك شيء، أن يُحاولُ ألفا رغم عجزهِ ذاك، و أن يُعطي كل ما هو في أمسِ الحاجة له لا تدرك معنى أن يُحبكَ شخص دون أن يملك أدنى إرادة و أقل رغبةُ في ذلك، أن يُحبك مَن لم يُفكر يوماً في أن يفعل، فتُصبحُ الاستثناء الوحيد له، حتى أن تلك المعتقدات والأفكار السابقة قد يغضُ البصرُ عنها لأجلك، يقَدِم التنازلاتِ واحدة تلو الأخرى، يُحاولُ كثيراً و دائماً، يهجر ڪبريائه دوماً، يتجهُ إليهم بتثاقل، كصخرة تُجرُ غصباً، ويُحلقُ إليك بخفةُ لا سابقَ لها، كالطيرِ تماماً. قسماً لن تُدرك معنى أن يُحبكَ من يُجدكَ مُختلفاً رغم أن قواعدهُ لا تقبلُ الاستثناء، يجدكَ أماناً رغم خوفه ذاك، يُحبڪ ولا يملڪ أسباباً مُرتبةَ و مبرراتُ مُنمقةُ لأن يُحبڪ، فقط يُحبڪ

   ليتنا نفهم أن جميع العلاقات خُلقت للراحة والرحمة:
   
   ""سَنشُد عضُدَكَ بأخيك""
   
   ""إذ يقول لصاحبهِ لا تحزن""
   
   ""وجعلَ بينكم مودةً ورحمة""
   
   لم نُخلَق لإثبات حسن النوايا، أو لنسعى لننتصر على بعضنا في أوقات الخلاف، لم نخلق لنستنزف أيامنا في علاقات صعبة ولا لننفق أعمارنا محشورين في زوايا الهدم والرتق..
   
   كلمة صادِقة كفيلة بإنهاء الخلاف..
   
   نظرة أمان ستنزع الخوف من القلوب..
   
   الحياة تركض بشكل مُفزع والعلاقات وُجِدت لتكون بمثابة استراحة ومتّكأ للقلوب لا تعباً ومشقة لها. 🌸

   وأنا تعذبني التفاصيل، لا أنسى الكلمات التي عذبتني وقت غضب أحدهم، قد لا أنام بسبب نظرة ما أزعجتني، أهتم كثيرًا بطريقة اللقاء والوداع، كذلك نبرة الصوت ونظرات العين، ألاحظ اهتمام وشغف الناس حين أتحدث وأسمع تنهيداتهم حين يشعرون بالملل، الردود الباردة لا أنساها، التفاصيل تقودني ناحية الجنون، لا أستطيع وصف وشرح كل هذا لأي شخص، قد يسخر، قد يتهمنني بـ المبالغة أو المرض أو حتى الخبث، لطالما حاولت التعايش دون أن أبالي بمثل هذه الأشياء لكنها تطاردني دائمًا في رأسي في صمتي الطويل، لطالما ظنوا إنني راضِ عن هذه اللعنة، لكن لا أحد يفهم إنني أكافح لأتعافى منها، التفاصيل سبب شقائي الأكبر في الحياة .

   لماذا لا نكتب في خانة الإنجازات كيف تركنا البيت القديم، وكيف انتقلنا من مدرسة إلى أخرى، كيف اكتشفنا الخدعة تلك، كيف خبأنا مشكلتنا عن قلوب أمهاتنا وتحملنا المسؤولية وحدنا بهدوء، كيف تصرفنا بأول يوم جامعة،  وكيف تصرفنا بشجاعة عندما أجبرتنا الظروف أن نسلك طريقًا لا نحبه، كيف حضنا حزن صديق، وكيف قلنا أول كلمة عزاء، وأول كلمة (مبارك)؛ لماذا لا نضع في خانة الخبرات تحديدًا كيف صبرنا على غياب الأشياء.
   
   لماذا لا نضع في خانة المهارات الصبر والسماح والثبات والقوة رغم الألم واليأس. الشهادات والأوراق أقرب إلى الحائط من ذاتنا، نضعها في برواز أنيق. أمّا هذه المواقف هي وحدها التي صنعتنا ?.

   ‏أنا أعمق من تلك الصورة التي في مخيلتك لي، أكثر قوة من هذا الذي تراه يكتب حزنًا، أشد لا مُبالاة من هذا الذي يُعاني من القلق والخوف دائمًا، وأكثرهم إنسحابًا في حين أنك تظن بأني لن أتجاوزك، أنا شخصٌ آخر لم تتمكن الأيام من شرحي لك ولن تستوعبني ظنونك أبدًا ?.

   ""أحببتُكَ حتى رأيتُ عيوبكَ محاسِنُ""
   
   من أعلى درجات الحُب أنّه الطرف التاني ينظر لعيوبك على أنها محاسن ويحبهّا.
   
   -لمّا هوَ يقتُل كل مخاوفَك ، يبقى خوَفك الوحيد انّك تفقدُه

   ماعد بدُّو شي إلا تبقى معهُ العُمر ، تصير انتَ همُّه الوحيد.

   -لمّا دعَوة بِاسمو لَربك تستجاب.
   
   -بِ رُغم المسافات قريب منّك لَ أبعد مَدى
   
   -لمّا تزيد الصدف الغريبة وتخليّك تصفُن قديشّا عظيمة.
   
   -بِوقت تكتر فيه إشارات القدر عَلى أنُه الشخص الصح..

   ناطرين الناس يقولوا تغيرنا
   
   تغيرنا بعد ما عرفونا
   
   ناطرين الكل يحس اديش تغيرنا
   
   اديش حلينا من جوا ومن برا
   
   وكيف ضحكة عيونّا عم تبين حتى بسكوتنا
   
   صوت من جواتك بيقلك تذكر إنه الحب ما بيكبر بطول المدة ، بيكبر بجمال المواقف حتى ولو كانت لحظات
   
   الكلمة الحلوة يلي بتطلع من دون نفس ما بتلزمنا
   
   الابتسامة الصفراوية مع كلمات دعم مجاملة كمان ما بتلزمنا
   
   اثبات الوجود منشان عشرة قديمة او مجرد معرفة عابرة ما اله اي قيمة ابدا وصدقوني انعدامه افضل
   
   الخلافات ما بتقتل الحب بالعكس تماما بجدده
   
   ويلي بيتخذ الخلاف ك حجة للفراق هاد ما بيعرف معنى الحب شو هية من الاساس
   
   اولا كون رفيق حالك ولا تعاتب حدا وخبرهن انه هي اللحظات رح تخلص متل ما ابتدت
   
   وتذكر ورا كل غيمة سودة رح يطلع ضو ويضيئ كل العتم يلي حاط فيك
   
   وبعد كل فشل في نجاح
   
   و وثاق بحالك وارجاع وقف من جديد لانه الكسر يلي جواتك ما بيلبقلك
   
   غربلوا قلوبكن وصفوها منيح واذا طلعت الكلمة من جواتكن افضل من انها تطلع عن طرف لسانكن لانه الملامح بتفضح الشخص
   
   الملامح ما بتعرف تجامل ولا تكذب مهما حاولتوا
   
   وخليكن متذكرين إنه دائرة الاصحاب او الاقارب كل ما بتصغر كل ما بتكون انضف
   
   ب أي علاقة فيها مشاعر حب بين شخصين لازم واحد منهن يكون هو الطرف يلي اكلها زيادة
   
   هو يلي بكبر بالمواضيع هو يلي بتحسس هو يلي عندو مشاعر فائضة وبيعطي كل يلي عندو من دون حد
   
   ووظيفة الطرف التاني انه يتحويه ويعرف يتعامل معه بالطريقة الصح
   
   المهم يعرف كيف يحتويه وما يخليه يحس بالنقص ابداً
   
   بهي الطريقة بيقدر فيها الطرفين يكملوا بعض ويعيشو بسلام ، مجرد انه كل واحد يعرف دوره بالعلاقة ويعرف شو هي واجباته "" لا اكتر ولا اقل ""

   بعد ضربات قاسية من الحياة ..بتلاقي حالك عم تبني سياج حول عالمك.. و بتستمتع بصحبة نفسك ..""مش وحيد""....بالعكس عندك معارف كتير، بس ""كينونتك مقدسة"".. بمعنى لا بتأثر فيك كلمة من حقود، ولا بينبض قلبك بسرعة عند أول كلمة ""بحبك"".. ما بتصدق إلا لما الأفعال يكون صوتها أعلى من الكلام..
   
   بترمم روحك.. بتعمل اي شي لتوصل للمكان الي بتستحقه.. مش رح تتعب غير ع شي بيستاهل فعلا... بتنفض عن نفسك كل الكلام السلبي .. بتلف وجهك عن كل حد اساء الك ..و بتبعد عن اي شيء بيعكر صفو مزاجك..
   
   بتتأكد انه اغلب الاشياء الي دايقتك بالماضي كانت سخافات مبتذلة ..بتصير اكثر صلابة، اكثر تحدي و بتنافس حالك ...ما بتسمح بالمقارنات بأي بحد...
   
   **الاكتفاء بالذات مش يعني انك بترفض البشر... بس يعني انه حياتك ما بتوقف عليهم..!**
   
   **الاكتفاء بالذات حقيقة لا يتقنها سوى الاقوياء**???

   ولا تجعل الأيام تضعُك بخانةِ #التقليديين فالعالم مليءٌ بالأسواقِ الصينية!
   
   لا تُحمّل روحك أكثر مما تستطيع فتتلف قبل موعدها..
   
   لا تحمل ذنب أحد ولا ترمِ بذنوبك على أحد..
   
   أنت ما أنت عليه الآن لأنك فعلتَ ما فعلتَ..

   صرنا بزمن نسينا فيه ربنا ??
   
   صار الشاطر لما يعصب يسب ربه ودينه، وحتى وقت المزح، صرنا كتير نشوف ونسمع مزح ومسخرة ونكت بايخة عن الدين، ليش من متى الدين صار مسخرة وهبل آهه من متى؟!!
   
   صار كل وقتنا الجوالات، الطشات، الحفلات، وابصر شو ، ونسينا ربنا وديننا ووصايا الرسول (صل الله عليه وسلم)، صار يومنا وإنما أيامنا تمر بدون ما نسجد لربنا، بدون ما نستغفر لمرة، بدون ما نذكر ربنا، بدون ما نحمده على إلي إحنا فيه ع نعمه إلي أنعمنا فيها بس للأسف مش حاسين فيها.
   
   ""اهتمينا بالجزء المادي وسبنا الجزء النفسي""!! ... ?
   
   قد ما عملت واشتغلت وصرت ووصلت وإنت بعيد عن ربك ما حيزبط معك أبداََ، ولو زبط ما حتحس بنشوة الفرح، رح تحس بشي ناقص، رح تحس ما عملت شي إنجاز مع إنك فعلاََ بتكون منجز ... ماشي اشتغل على حالك، إنجز، إتعب، طش، إعمل وروح على حفلات، افتح جوالك وتصفح، إعمل إلي بيحلالكك وإلي بتريدهه بسس رجااءََ غذي روحكك، أعطي نفسكك حقها، ما تظلم حالكك، ما تنسى ربكك ونعمهه عليكك، وما تنسى إنه بسببه قبل تعبكك وقبل كل شي عملته إنت وصلت لهون، خلي ربكك بين عيونكك وبقلبكك، وحتى بحزنكك إحكي الحمد لله ""حكمتهه بهالحزن والكآبةة إلي فيكك إنت مش مدركها"". ??
   
   ((حيآتكك بدون مآ تكون قريب من ربكك عبث ومآ فيهآ فآيدة)).

   وحيداً أصنع القهوة وحيداً أشربُ القهوة.
   
   فأخسر من حياتي الآخرين .. أخسر النشوة ..!!
   
   القهوةُ لونُ الارض، رائحةُ الارض بعد بعد اول مطر، في اول الفجر.
   
   القهوة لا تُشرب على عجلٍ
   
   القهوةٌ أخت الوقت تُحْتَسى على مهلٍ وتصنعُ على مهلٍ
   
   القهوة صوت المذاق، صوت الرائحة البني
   
   القهوة تأمّلٌ وتغلغل في النفس وفي الذكريات.. ☕ ? ?

   بس بتنصدم انك مش أحسن حدا بالعالم. انك مش عم توصل ل شو مابدك. انك مش سعيد. والاهم منه كله، انك مش راضي عن نفسك.
   
   بتعرف ليه؟ لانه بالوقت الي انت كنت سند لكتير ناس بتحبهم كنت على حافة الانهيار. و ماحدا منهم كان وقتها ساندك.
   
   بالوقت الي كنت تعمل كل اشي بحسن نية وحب لمساعدة غيرك، كنت تشوفهم بيتهموك بشي غلط، بيفسرو نيتك على كيفهم، بيوسخو أفعالك،بيسبّوك، كلو من ورا ظهرك.
   
   بالوقت الي كنت تقاوم، حامل كل هموم الدنيا، تبتسم لكل حزين، تساعد كل محتاج، بس ماعمر حدا سألك اذا كنت منيح، ماعمرو حدا اهتم.
   
   يمكن هالتصرفات وردود الفعل كلها كافية تخليك تبعد. تتأكد انه لازم تبعد. لازم تبطل منيح هلقد. تبطل تعطي بدون مقابل. تخليك تحتاج ترجع تحس بقيمتك الي فقدتها على احدى الطرقات،بينما كنت مشغول بانتشال بعض الناس من حزنهم..

ويريح بالها

   هاي البنت ما صارت قوية ببلاش، ولا تغيرت بيوم وليلة.. هاي البنت شافت كتير بحياتها .. عانت كتير، ياما انحرق قلبها، ياما انصدمت بناس وياما بكت حسرة وخوف!
   
   مرت عليها ليالي ما بعلم فيها إلا ربنا ومواقف تخطتها لحالها. أحلام انكسرت قدام عيونها، ناس خسرتهم ورا بعض، فشل كبير مرقت فيه.. وموجة احباط من كلشي حوليها لحتى صارت هيك.
   
   هاي البنت صارت قوية لأنها اكتشفت انه الضعف ما بيفيدها بشي، وانه بزمنها وحدُه القوي اللي بيقدر يعيش ويجتاز مرحلة الحياة بنجاح..
   
   لأنها اكتشفت انه القوة هي خيارها الوحيد مشان ما يتكرر معها الوجع اللي صار معها، صارت بطلة نفسها، صارت تحمي حالها بحالها، صارت تدافع عن حقها بإيدها لأنه لو عملت هيك، راح يضيع حقها. ❤

  بس برضه رح يجي وقت و أسكّر و أبعد و أرمي كل شي وراي عن اقتناع تام و بكمل طريقي ، ساعتها ما بتطلع وراي أبدًا وما برجع أبدًا لو شو ما صار ، لأني فعلًا لما خلص أقرر أمشي و أترك كل شي وراي بكون رصيد علاقتنا استنفذته تمامًا من الأخطاء اللي أنا تحملتها.
  
  شكرًا لكل حدا خلاني أنهي علاقتي فيه وأنا ضميري مرتاح.""

   رح يجي عليكي وقت تحسي انك خايفة من كل شي حوليكِ.. خايفة تمشي لقدام ..خايفة ترجعي لورا .. خايفة تضلك وافقة مكانك..
   
   خايفة تحبي و خايفة تنحبي ، خايفة من الشوارع الي فيها ازمة و خايفة من الشوارع الفاضية..خايفة تصدقيهم و يطلعوا كذابين .. خايفة تكذبيهم يطلع معهم حق .. خايفة تهربي من مسؤولياتك و تندمي .. خايفة تواجهي مشاكلك و تفشلي ..خايفة تحكي و ما يسمعوكي و خايفة تسكتي و تنقهري ... خايفة تعملي الي نفسك فيه و يلوموكي .. خايفة ما تعملي الشي الي بتحبيه و تعيشي عمرك تتحسري .. خايفة تجربي و ما تنجحي .. و خايفة ما تجربي و تضلك مكانك...
   
   اتطمني اللي راح اعرفي انه كان لازم انه يروح ، و ما بينفع ترجعيله و لا هو رح يرجعلك.. لا توقفي مكانك ، امشي لقدام- ..اتحركي لا تخافي واجهي و اتحدي .. اوقعي و انا بأكدلك انك كل مره رح توقعي فيها رح تقومي اقوى بميت مره و كل مره رح تخليكي تقدري تمشي- اتحركي بإنطلاق اكتر من الاول ..
   
   لا تستني حدا ، لا تطلبي من حدا يتمسك فيكي ، لا تطلبي من حدا يهتم فيكي ، لا تلومي و تعاتبي الا ولاد الاصول و بس ..
   
   احكي قولي ""لاء"" ارفضي لما تحسي انك مش راضية عن الي بيصر ؛ و اسكتي لما تحسي انك ما عندك طاقة تحكي ، ازعلي و عبري عن زعلك .. لا_تخافي ..!
   
   خلي صوتك مسموع و رأيك اله بصمة ، و ما تخافي منهم من تعليقاتهم من ارائهم من ردة فعلهم ..
   
   لا تخلي الورده الي جواكي تدبل مهما يصير .. الناس و المشاكل و اخطائك و جروحك هما الي رح يدلوكي على الطريق الصح ، هما الي رح يفهموكي رح يعلموكي كيف تعيشي كيف تتصرفي ..لا_تخافي ..
   
   حبي نفسك و دائما عيشي اللحظة كأنها اخر لحظة في حياتك ، ضحكتك ما تمحيها عن وجهك ؛ ولا تسمحي لحدا يمحيها ..
   
   ثقتك_بنفسك هي الي بتلزمك دائما في كل مرحلة من مراحل حياتك ، ثقتك بنفسك لازم تزيد مش تقل ، راسك دائما مرفوع مش غرور ولا تكبر بس لانك ""واثقة من نفسك"" ..!
   
   سيبي الي بدو يحكي عنك يحكي ؛ سيبي الي بدو يغلط فيكي يغلط .. سيبي الي بدو يظلمك يظلم .. الله موجود و اتأكدي انهم ""كلهم بيتمنوا يكونوا زيك "" معلش حرام اعذريهم ..!
   
   لا_تخافي..!

   أنا أنسانه قوية ، مش محتاجه لحدا ، أنا انسانه فيها توقف ع رجليها بنفس اللحضه الي وقعت فيها ، وبأمكاني أحل مشاكلي بدقيقة ، وفيني اوقع ب ألف مشكله وما يبين عليي ، بقدر أخبي ضعفي ، وكمان باللحضه يلي بكون فيها ضعيفة تشوف نار جوا عيوني ، لانو أنا متل الجبل كل ما زدت ع هالجبل تراب كل ما بقوى أكتر وبصعب هدمو ، أنا أنسانه( مؤخراً )
   
   بلشت تؤُمن بفشل الصدقات ، وكره الاقارب ، لما بطلع حولي بلاقي كتير بيستنو مني اوقع ، بس لأ? أنا قوية ، أنا أقوى من إني أوقع قدام أي حدا ...
   
   القوة مش شعور بيجينا فجأة ، القوة شعور بدو وقت ليتكون عنا ، ما بيتولد هالشعور من فراغ ، القوة شعور بينولد من مواقف ، من اشخاص ?
   
   الفترة يلي بحس فيها الانسان إنو أضعف إنسان على وجه الارض هي نفس اللحضه يلي بتخلق جواتو هالشعور ، زي ما بيطلع الامل من جوا اليأس
   
   بتطلع القوة من جوا الضعف
   
   احياناً بوصل الانسان لمرحلة بيستسلم فيها لكشي ، مرحلة بتجبرو يعيش أشياء ما بدو ياها أو بالأصح ما كان متوقع إنو بيوم يعيشها ..
   
   بالمرحله هي ببلش الانسان يفكر ويفكر ويفكر لحتى يلاقي حالو بلش ينهار ، وبلشت الدنيا تضيف عليه ، باللحضه هاي برجع يوقف على رجليه بس يلي إختلف هالمره إنو ما احتاج إيد تنمدلو ، هو إستجمع كل قوتو لحتى قدر انو يوقف مره تانية
   
   وهون ببلش يتولد عند الانسان شعور القوة وبنفس الوقت التخلي وعدم الحاجة لأي حدا ، لأنو باللحضه يلي انكسر فيها وقف (لحالو) وببلش فكرة إنو أنا قوي تكبر براسو ..
   
   هالفكرة بتصير تكبر جوا عقلو لحتى تنتقل لقلبو وتنمحي منو جميع الوساوس إلي خلتو يحس بالضعف
   
   وبرجع بوقف وقفة بتخلي يحس إنو بحياتو ما وقف قبل هالمره لأنو هي أول مرة بكون واثق من حالو ومن قوتو ومن هون بتبلش حياتو واحساسو بالثقة إلي بتخليه ما يحتاح حدا وبضل يحكي

   بمين طلعتِ هاي السنة؟؟
   
   طلعت بنفسي.. آه طلعت بنفسي، صرت أبعد نفسي عن الأشياء الي بتدايقها ،و زاد تقديري الها، اهتم بنفسيتي، استوعب انه مش كل الناس بتستاهل عفويتي و طاقتي....
   
   مش لازم اطلع بناس جديدة يعني، نفسي كفاية علي، اكسب نفسي، اعطيها حقها كامل، نفسي بتستحق كتير مني ،
   
   ، طلعت بمكاسب كتير، أولهم نفسي ، حتى -الخسائر- الي كنت مُعتقدة انها خسائر طلعت مكاسب، كسبت كتير، كسبت سلام داخلي ، نفسي بتدعمني. نفسي بتقويني، ثقتي بنفسي بتسندني، نفسي بتشجعني .. معقول في أغلي من نفسي؟ في اثمن من نفسي ......بصراحة ما أتوقع !!
   
   و شو تعلمتِ؟؟
   
   تعلمت انه الي بيستنى، بيتعب..
   
   الي بيستنى شكر، اهتمام، حُب، رجوع ناس راحو، تقدير، الي بيستنى اَي شي من اَي حد بيتعب جدا ، تعلمت اقلل توقعاتي، تعلمت اتعامل مع نفسي كأنه ما في متلها بهالكون، عودتها ما تستنى شي ،، ما تستنى حدا.. صرت اسيب كل واحد يفهم الي بدو إياه بمزاجه و عادي ، و الي راح ما أزعل عليه، ما استنى تقدير غير مني انا .. لأنك رح تكتشف مع الوقت انه ما حدا بيقدرلك شي، انت بتكون تفكر كل الناس مزوقة متلك و بتقدر اصغر الأمور، بس رح تكتشف انه نادرا جدا لتلاقي حدا يقدر اَي شي انت عملته عشانه، عشان هيك قدر نفسك بنفسك ..!!
   
   و بوعد نفسي بالسنين الجاي، أني احبها اكتر و انها غالية جدا ،، و بتستاهل كتير جدا ...⁦❤️⁩

   وشو صعب انك تكون حابب كتير تعطي ثقتك لشخص بس هالشخص بكل الطرق بحاول يخذلك ?
   
   انك تكون تعبان من هالحياة تعبان لدرجة من التعب تمرض وما حدا يسأل عنك
   
   اخخ يما
   
   الدنيا تغيرت وبطل حدا يهتم بحدا
   
   حتى اعز ناسك تركتك
   
   وشو صعبة تكون بوضع نفسك تحكي كلشي بقلبك بس ما في حدا يسمعك
   
   ما حدا بفهمك
   
   ما بفهم وجعك ولا بفهم شو بدك
   
   غير كلمة بعين الله ما بيحكيلك
   
   بدي حدا يضمني بحكيه
   
   ويكون قده
   
   الدنيا ما في امان يوم الك وعشرين يوم عليك
   
   تعبت من اني استنى اليوم الحلو فيها
   
   بس الشي الحلو بين كل هالوجع يكون عندك عيلة بتسوى كل ه العيشة
   
   عيلة تهتم فيك بتخاف عليك متل روحها واغلى
   
   ازا حكيت اخ تلاقي مين يسندك ويوقف جنبك
   
   وعندك صديقة بتسوى الف صديقة والف بنت بحياتك

   ححبيبتي من بعدكك ???
   
   يلا نكون عفويين بعلاقاتنا مع بعض؟
   
   انا شفتك وما سلمت عليك، انا اكيد مش منتبها، او يمكن تعبانه، مدايقة ولو سلمت عليك راح يبيّن علي انه انا منكدة، ف انت راح تتدايق،
   
   لما انا بكون اونلاين وما برد عليك بكون وراي الف اشي عادي ويمكن شفت المسج وما بدي ارد لانه مش بالمزاج الي احكي فيه، لانه زي ما انا صار معي هيك راح ييجي وقت عليك وتكون بنفس الحالة،
   
   لما بحكي حكي جدّي يمكن يدايقك المقصود بكون منه مصلحتك، او الحقيقة الي لازم تعرفها، الصح الي لازم تسمعه! مش لانه انا بدي احاسبك ع الكلمة ودايماً ضدك اتأكد انه بحبك وبخاف عليك،
   
   لما بلغي مشوار معك، مش لاني بتهرب او مش حابة اشوفك بس الوقت والظروف وكتير اشياء ما سمحتلي اطلع معك بهالوقت،
   
   لما بترن علّي مره ومرتين وما برد، ترا نفس قصة المسجات، انه انا مش منتبه وعادي انه اكون منتبه بس ما بدي ارد لاني تعبانه او مدايقة او عندي ضجة،
   
   -ممكن لما تقرا هاد الكلام تقتنع فيه من ناحيتي انا، مش من ناحيتك انه انا ما بدي احكي او ارد او اطلع معك انت خاصةً لانه الموضوع مش شخصي ابداً ولو بنفس الوقت حد غيرك عمل معي نفس الاشي ردة الفعل حتكون نفسها!
   
   وانا مع انه كمان في ناس مستحيل تعمل معهم هالامور مش لانه بحبهم اكتر، بس لانه همه نفسهم هدول مرّ وقت وعملت معهم هالاشي وما تحسسوا ابداً، وبتقبلوك في جميع حالاتك وشو ما عملت ما حيعاتبوك ولا يتغيروا عليك، ف انت لا ارادياً حتى لو كنت مدايق بتضل معهم طبيعي ، بس رجاءاً خلينا نكون عفويين بعلاقاتنا وما ندقّق ع كل كلمه ، موقف صغير، نظرة صارت بينا لانه الحياة بدها تمشي مع الناس الي بنحبها ف لا تخربوا ع بعض علاقاتكم من امور مش مستاهله. ??✋

   بس بتكرر الموقف معك مرة وتنين وتلات وبتوصل معك لنقطة انو خلص بطلت اتحمل لازم اعمل اشي مش هيك يضل ينحكى عني واسكت.. بس بعدين بتقعد مع حالك شوية وبتفكر بتستنتج انو ما في اي داعي تحط راسك براس هالشخص وتنزل تفكيرك لاله لان هالشخص مريض، مريض نفسي وبيحاول يطلع عيوبه فيك، بشوف الكمال بحاله وهو كله عيوب، هالشخص يلي بيعجب بحاله، اناني ومريض نفسي شخص شايف انو مستحيل يخطا، مستخيل يكون ظالم، بس لو تيجي تحط حالك جمبه رح تحس بظلمه وببرائتك، رح تحس بانك معافى من الغرور ومعافى من كلمة انا، رح تشوف انك مش كامل بس احسن منه بكتير...

لم يفت الإوان بعد
تحمل حتى النهاية
اذا اردت شيئا فقاتل من أجله✌
يجب ان تقتل المماطلة حالا
النجاح العظيم يتطلب جهد عظيم?
لا تحلم بلنجاح
بل استيقظ لتحققه?
آيه?
ربي فرج لها كل هم وكل غم
وحقق لها كل أمل وكل حلم
واستجب لها كل دعوة
ربي أسعد قلبها
ويسر أمرها واجبر كسرها
يا رب❤
جمعتك طيبه??

   وَ في قلبي أمنياتْ ? ... كنتُ اظنها لن تتحقق ، لن يتحقق ما أتمنى ، لن أصلِ لذاك الحُلم المُتوهج في داخلي ، لطالما حـَلمتُ بتلك اللحظه ، عندما أصبح في وسطِ حـُلمٍ كنتُ أتمناه?
   
   وقعتْ وتعثرتْ وأُصِبت ، رغم كُل ما مررتُ بهِ من عقبات وعثرات ?
   
   وكُل ما سمعتهُ ، ونظراتٍ إحداها شفقه والاخرى شماته ....
   
   بعدَ كُلِ هذا ، وجدتُ نفسي أقف وسطَ حُلمي ، أرى التهاني والتبريكات تهطِلُ عليَّ مـِثل المطر ، أحسستُ بذاكَ الشعور ، تذوقتُ طعمَ النجاح ، وفي نهاية الطريق  تحققت أولى احلامي ، وسأمضي في هذا الدرب ولن أتراجع ?

  كلنا عنا هموم أكيد , في الاشي السهل , وفي الاشي الصعب , مشاكل مادية , مشاكل نفسية , مشاكل عائلية , مشاكل مشاكل مشاكل .. الكل عنده أكيد بس بتتفاوت درجه هالمشاكل من شخص لشخص !

   أنت , اه أنت يلي عم تقرأ هالكلام
   
   ليش مستغرب أني بحكي معك !
   
   أكيد بتقرأ هالكلام بس بدون ما تحرك اشي وما الك صوت لا عالي ولا حتى واطي , وأساساً هو مو مسموع الا الك لحالك !
   
   نغمة الصوت يلي بتكون بالقلب بهيك لحظة هي الصوت الحقيقي عنجد , ما في كذب بكون حتى ولو حرف واحد , لانك عارف حالك وعارف قلبك شو بحكي بالضبط ..
   
   هو اشي غريب وحلو بنفس الوقت , لما تسمع نغمة صوتك الرنانة , كأنك عم تسمعه من تسجيل مكالمة صوتية أو فيديو مسجل الك , احبالك الصوتية هون بتكون أحلى وانقى من أي صوت بتسمعه الك !
   
   ممكن كمان وأنت عم تقرأ هالكلام أو أي كلام بتقرأه بس بتكون ساكت "" إذا بتعرف مين يلي بحكي "" رح تقرأه بصوت يلي باعثلك ياه !
   
   بس بكل صراحة حالياً ما في حدا بحكي كلمة وحدة حالياً , أنت عم تتخيل هالاشي ولساتك عم تقرأه كمان وما سكتت !
   
   ممكن حقيقة وممكن خيال يكون , بس ما بعرف كيف الصوت بصير هيك من جواتك أنت ?

   - المطار
   
   في ناس بتستقبل وبتنهي بالسلامة لرجوع أهلها وأحبابها على وطنه , ومن الجهة الثانية في ناس بتوعد وبتبكي على فراق ناس رح يسافرو من عندهم ويبطلوا يقدروا يشوفهم الا بالمناسبات !
   
   - المستشفى
   
   بهيك مكان كل واحد فينا رح يمر فيه , ببداية حياته وبنهايتها
   
   كيف يعني ؟
   
   طيب , لما تنولد بالمستشفى رح تصرخ أول ما تيجي وتبكي ..
   
   من جهة ثانية في ناس رح تصرخ عليك لما تموت بعد عمر طويل !
   
   - قاعة المناسبات
   
   بكل قاعة ممكن تكون فرح وممكن تكون زعل ..
   
   بتكون فرح لما يجي عليها عرسان وصوت الزغاريت بكل مكان والصوت ما بهدي بالقاعة من الفرح الموجود عند الناس ..
   
   ومن جهة ثانية هدوء الناس مع العزاء لما يكونوا بالقاعة والكل منصت للقرآن الكريم ?
   
   هي أختلافات بكل مكان وين ما تروح ووين ما تيجي , لكل اشي في جهتين , حامي بارد , في فائز وفي خاسر , في هدوء وفي ضجيج ..
   
   هي بس أختلافات .. !

   بحياتي ما رح انسى معاناتي و وجعي و تعبي .. بحياتي ما رح انسى كل يوم مرقت فيه .. كل يوم كنت أعيشه كان بالنسبة إلي متل ال ٢٠ سنة .. ما كنت أحس إنه رح يخلص .. بكيت دم .. و انحرق قلبي .. بعدت عن كل شي .. و بطلت اشكي همي لحدا .. مخدتي و تختي همة اللي حاسين بوجعي .. و مش محتاجة احكي لحد لحتى يحكيلي معلش ، أو اصبري ، أو عادي ، .. أخدت عهد على حالي إني ما احتاج حد و متل ما وقعت رح أقوم لحالي .. و رح أرجع أقوى من قبل .. بعرف إنه بدي وقت بس مع هيك رح أضل أحاول و ما رح استسلم .. حرقة القلب و الدموع و المشاعر و التفكير و تعب البال ما رح يخلوني أيأس من شي .. أبداً
   
   ما رح أسمح لحد يكسرني بعد هيك ، رح أرجع مبسوطة و مرتاحة و قوية و ما رح أسمح لأي شي إنه يأثر على راحتي او تعب قلبي بعد هيك

   الخيال يمكن هو الحياة اللي نفسك تعيشها،التخيلات والتصورات اللي بتدور دائماً ببالك بس بقولوا صعب تتحقق،الخيال في أغلب الأوقات مهرب إلنا من عالمنا.
   
   يمكن لأنه الواقع مش مثل اللي بنتمناه،بنلجأ للخيال لنهرب شوي،ونأخد قوة لنكمل في واقعنا .
   
   بمعنى آخر الخيال بغذي أحلامنا،أحلامنا اللي بتصير أهداف بعد هيك ،أهدافك اللي بتحدد طريقك و واقعك.
   
   والحلم إله أكثر من معنى،هو كمان تخيلات بس فيك تحكي أقرب شوي من الخيال،يعني فيك بالمثابرة والعزيمة تلمس أحلامك ♥.
   
   أحكيلك شغلة ؟
   
   قبل أكمن سنة كُنت بحلم أزور الأقصى،بشوفها بالمنام♥،وبصحى مبسوطة عَ أمل أشوفها،حالياً صار مُجرد خيال في ظل هالأوضاع الصعبة،صار الحلم تضل بخير حتى لو ما أشوفها ☺.

   انت مش زعلان لمّا تقعُد من وهي صغيره ، تبني شخصيّتها ، عشان تحقق حلمها بأنها تصير صحفيّه ، وبالاخر تيجي تقُلها ، اقعدي بالدار، انا فش عندي بنات ، "" بتسيب، وبتدور ""
   
   انت مش زعلان، لمّا يكون حلمها تصير دكتوره ، وتساعد كثير ناس بحياتها ، وبالاخر تقُلها ، شو بدّك بهالتعليم ، كلّه هبل ، يلا اتعلمّي معلمه ( مع انه وظيفه المعلم/ه وظيفه مشرّفه جدّا ) فوتيلنا ٥ آلاف اخر الشهر بكفّي .
   
   انت مش زعلان، لمّا تكسِر طموح أُنثى ، وتحبسها ، يا رجُل انت .
   
   لمّا تحطّم كل هدف عم تبنيه ، من وهي صغيره ، عشان تبيّن انك انت المسيطِر ..
   
   "" نحنا ما عنّا بنات بتتوظّف بشهادتها ""
   
   هاي الجمله امسِكها وبِلها ب أعمق نقطه بالمحيط .. لانه ؛

   وبعد كل هاد، بعدك زعلان ، ليش مرات البنت بدها واحد غني ؟

   معناها خلّيك زعلان ، وطُق .
   
   تحبِسهاش بالقفَص.

   وهاد ما بيمنع انك ما تكوني انيقة بالعكس ..
   
   الأناقة بدها عفوية ولبس حلو ومش شرط يكون ماركة او من اغلا المحلات ، انت قادرة تكوني ""ستايل"" بس بشوية تغيير  ، وسعر الإشي ما بيفقدك قيمتك ابدا ، احيانا فينا نشوف اشياء رخيصة كتير ونحبها وتكون مناسبة النا هاد الاشي مش عيب بالعكس وبرضو برأيي تكوني مميزة يعني ما تتبعي الموضة مشان تعطي حالك حق الاختلاف..
   
   بمختصر حلو تعتني بحالك وتغيري وتعيشي كل اشي بكون بنفسك ، بس لا تنسي ""طبيعتك"" لأنه لو رح تتعودي على كل الصناعات فيك رح تصيري تخجلي من شكلك الأصلي وتوصلي امرحلة قلة الثقة بالنفس انه لو طلعت بدون اشي عوجهك طول اليوم رح تحطي راسك بالارض وانت جداً طبيعية وحلوة بس خلص قلة الثقة بالنفس مع التكرار الكبير للصناعات❤
   
   اعتني بحالك بس بشكل بتستحقي مش تقليد للغير ومؤخرا "" إختاري المناسب والمريح مش شرط الأجمل بس برضو يكون حلو وفخم ليعزز ثقتك بذاتك ويرضيها "" وخليك غيري وسعيدة وواثقة بحالك ولا تشوفي حالك بعيون الناس ، خليك ""قنوعة"" انت نعمة من رب الكون لا تخسريها وتخربيها ، ديري بالك على حالك.??

   هل تفكرت يوماً في حقيقة وجودك  , كيف حملتك أمك ثم ولدتك , فجئت إلى هذا العالم و لم تكن من قبل شيئاً ؟
   
   هل تأملت يوماً كيف تنبت تلك الأزهار المزروعة في أحواض غرفة الجلوس من قلب تراب أسود فاحم موحل بألوان زاهية و شدىً عطر ؟
   
   هل شغلك انزعاجك من طيران البعوض حولك عن التفكر كيف أنها تحرك أجنحتها بسرعة فائقة تجعلك غير قادر على رؤيتها ؟
   
   هل تفكرت يوماً بأن قشور الفاكهة المهملة هي في حقيقتها أغلفة حافظة عالية الجودة , و بأن هذه الفاكهة - كالموز و البطيخ و البرتقال مثلاً - موضبة في داخلها بطريقة تحفظ طعمها و شذاها ؟
   
   هل تدبرت يوماً كيف يمضي العمر حثيثاً , فتذكرت أنك سوف تشيخ و تصبح ضعيفاً و تفقد جمالك و صحتك و قوتك ؟
   
   هل فكرت في ذلك اليوم الذي سوف يرسل الله فيه ملائكة الموت لترحل معهم عن هذا العالم ؟
   
   هل تساءلت يوماً : لماذا يتعلق الناس بدنيا فانية فيما هم بحاجة ماسة إلى المجاهدة من أجل الفوز بالآخرة ؟
   
   إن الإنسان هو المخلوق الذي أنعم الله عليه بملكة التفكير و مع ذلك فإن معظم الناس لا يستخدمون هذه الملكة المهمة كما يجب , حتى أن بعض الناس يكاد لا يتفكر أبداً ..!
   
   في الحقيقة كل إنسان يمتلك قدرة على التفكر هو نفسه ليس على دراية بمداها , و ما أن يبدأ الإنسان باستكشاف قدرته هذه و استخدامها , حتى يتبدى له الكثير من الحقائق التي لم يستطع أن يسبر أغوارها من قبل . و هذا الأمر في متناول أي شخص , و كلما استغرق الإنسان في تأمل الحقائق , تعززت قدرته على التفكر . و لا يحتاج الإنسان في حياته سوى هذا التفكر الملي و المجاهدة الدؤوبة من بعده ..

   شايفين البنت القوية؟
   
   هاي البنت ما صارت قوية ببلاش، ولا تغيرت بيوم وليلة.. هاي البنت شافت كتير بحياتها .. عانت كتير، ياما انحرق قلبها، ياما انصدمت بناس وياما بكت حسرة وخوف!
   
   مرت عليها ليالي ما بعلم فيها إلا ربنا ومواقف تخطتها لحالها. أحلام انكسرت قدام عيونها، ناس خسرتهم ورا بعض، فشل كبير مرقت فيه.. وموجة احباط من كلشي حوليها لحتى صارت هيك.
   
   هاي البنت صارت قوية لأنها اكتشفت انه الضعف ما بيفيدها بشي، وانه بزمنها وحدُه القوي اللي بيقدر يعيش ويجتاز مرحلة الحياة بنجاح..
   
   لأنها اكتشفت انه القوة هي خيارها الوحيد مشان ما يتكرر معها الوجع اللي صار معها، صارت بطلة نفسها، صارت تحمي حالها بحالها، صارت تدافع عن حقها بإيدها لأنه لو عملت هيك، راح يضيع حقها. ❤

   Come on reaper! I'll do anything!I'm a hero I dont get protection like  Villians do with Black Hat! I cant sell my soul like they do.. I'm on my own... My err boyfriend isnt even from my universe so I can't depend on him to keep me safe. At least tell me do I fall in a heroic  battle?

  Dr.Slug..?? *Right he doesn't know about the cinnamon rolls boyfriend* But..sorry kiddo, I'm not allowed to give out that info either but..I'll give you a hint since you've been a good kiddo..the person that will kiII you is someone you wouldn't expect to.. so expect the unexpected..
  
  I don't normally let escaping Death slide but.. in exchange for the coffee you just brought and the presents, we'll say we never had this conversation if any of the other Gods ask, alright?

1584,"
   Yeah it's not a fun job but I Dont take it personal.. Plus I wanted to ask you something.. My family and villains are out to k!ll me.I wanted to see if you could check and see if my times up anytime soon?I'm a elf so I live a very long time naturally  but with all the trouble Ive been having..

  ..That's a first, most people would have a bone to pick over the Grim Reaper..even if it is his job, nobody exactly likes it..the fact I'm banged up right now is proof of that

  *Well he did keep a tiny bit of magic so he's somewhat functioning, he knows if he let himself go back to the state he were originally in Geno would panic and give all the magic he has to him, honestly the fact he's able to even think that out is a improvement, earlier he wasn't able to think at all and flat out said he was afraid and thought he was dusting*

  It's not better for you! You'll be in bad shape..! *Reaper frowned though you can't exactly deny that he was doing better now with the magic boost, he was actually able to talk and argue like normal without stuttering* You helped me a lot already..you don't have to share your magic..!

   why do you want to be drunk??

  Let's just say there's stuff even Death would like to forget about..after seeing first hand how almost everyone forgot what happened during the Christmas party after they drank that spiked punch, I decided to experiment a bit..

  "
1643,"
   Why do you drink bIeach to begin with?
  ","
  Well, you see, us God's aren't able to get drunk like normal monsters, being a God makes you more immune to certain things like for instance..I don't get sick unless I get near my Death bed, I have to be at my weakest to fall ill so if you catch one of us with a cold or something then it's pretty serious.. for one of us to be able to get drunk we would need something stronger than aIcohoI, I picked out bIeach though it has some downsides..

   I hope so...
  ","
  I know so..*Reaper says before scooting himself over a bit so he's now laying in Genos lap* if you weren't here to help me, I'd be doing a lot worse than this
  "
1645,"
   After that I learned I needed to hide any bleach in the house, including the bleach I use for my clothes...
  ","
  Heh, your such a worry wart and I find it adorable~ *Reaper just smiles up at him*
  "
1646,"
   Wait a minute that tag says from Geno he bought you bleach?
  ","
  To be fair, he did it as a joke..he didn't expect me to actually drink it..
  "
1647,"
   Do you drink?
  ","
  Well..I do drink BIeach and coffee..

1648,"
   *Geno is fully aware of the plushies of him, but he just acts like he never notices because life is easier that way, he grabs a Life flower coming back out* Here your ribs are still looking pretty bad *he places the life flower on Reaper's ribcage*
  ","
  *lol**Reaper sighs in relief, the flowers did help his injuries but given he's the God of Death, they aren't as effective as they would be on someone else, Life and Deaths magic don't exactly mix well together but good news is, his arm was now healed thanks to the flowers, you can't tell it yet though since it's still wrapped up in a sling*
  
  Thanks Love, I should be better with my angel of Death looking after me~ *he winks*
  "
1649,"
   *that's where Geno is looking*
  ","
  *He might find there was a plush of himself holding a bag filled with life flowers tied to its plush hands sitting on a shelf above their clothes, at the bottom of their closet was a mound of Geno plushies, someone is a little obsessed*
  
  ..Geno..?
  "
1650,"
   *Geno carefully lies Reaper down and goes looking for another Life Flower*
  ","
  ..mnnh..*Reaper then buries his skull into their pillow while Geno looks for another Life flower, the God usually keeps a stash of them in their closet in case they ever need them* ..
  "
1651,"
   *after Geno shoos Goth away he starts checking Reaper's wounds redressing the bandages and getting a new ice pack*
  ","
  *Reaper winces when his bandages were changed, Geno may notice his old bandages had red splotches all over them and his ribs had new red stains over them, once they were bandaged back up with a fresh ice pack, he collapses against poor Geno who is probably beyond freaked out*
  "
1652,"
   Dad? Are you awake now? *Goth walks over to his parents* You know, you never gave me my birthday gift--why is there a ice pack on you? I don't think you need any help being cold
*GOTH*
  ","
  ...*Reaper gives Goth a glare and right when he was about to say something to him, he started coughing with blœd starting to spew from his mouth*.. G-Gothy.. ..your... g-grounded..
  "
1653,"
   Nothing, just hungry *starts picking through the Grillby's Goth got for him*
  ","
  ..Okay..if you say so..*Reaper knows that's not entirely true but he doesn't feel now is the best time to talk to Geno about what might be bothering him*
  
  So..how do you feel about us going on a date later? Or we could head off to that AU now..the ice is really helping..I think I can move around with it..
  
  *Until it melts--*
  "
1654,"
   *Is going to try not to panic about the hurt to breathe comment*
  ","
  *Oof**Reaper took note on Genos silence and gave a concerned look* ..Hey, what's with that look? You look like you've seen a Death just now..
  "
1655,"
   *Geno wraps the ice back to him* Ice can help numb pain
  ","
  I was close..*Reaper winces a bit at first but it seems like the ice was really starting to help, he looks a lot more relaxed now and even let's out a sigh of relief* well..it's starting to feel better..it doesn't hurt to breathe right now.. you really are my angel of Death, you know that? *he gives a smile up at Geno*
  "
1656,"
   *Geno carefully gets up, disturbing Reaper as little as possible before going to their medical supplies fridge/freezer and getting an ice pack* Where do you need it?
  ","
  *aw**Reaper uses his good arm to point at his ribcage* T-thanks Love.. Ice is supposed to help with pain..r-right?
  "
1657,"
   Yes, I'm fine *though he is worried about how easily Reaper agreed*
  ","
  ..You know..you look really hot when you say that..*Seriously Reaper?* But jokes aside ..Love..I hate to ask..but..I can't move on my own right now.. can..you get some ice or..maybe..one of the kiddos can..?

1658,"
   It's fine, just rest
  ","
  ..Okay..*Reaper agreed to that pretty easily*..b..but..are you doing okay..?

1659,"
   *Is about to st@b an anon*
  ","
  *Reaper then lays his skull back against Geno after his coughing subsides and closes his eye sockets* ..S-sorry Love..I'm really tired..
  "
1660,"
   but what about that au?
  ","
  ..*Reaper was about to speak but he gets cut off coughing and you can spot some blœd trickling down his mouth, he is definitely not in any shape to go anywhere at least not on his own, Geno was right to take him to bed*..
  "
1661,"
   Anon, shut it
  ","
  ..Geno..? *Reaper looks up at his Tsun, he sounds a bit drowsy* ..That you..?
  "
1662,"
   So you aren't going to that AU?
  ","
  ..Hnnh..? *Reaper opens a eye slightly, he kinda dozed off until you woke him*..
  "
1663,"
   *Geno rubs his lone temple with his skeletal fingers* How much more damage is there
  ","
  ..*Reaper goes silent for a moment, it's like he isn't sure how to respond to Geno, I don't think he expected his Tsun to see right through him*
  
  Um..so..uh... ... ...anyway about that AU we were heading to--*he decided to try and change the subject*
  "
1664,"
   No complaints except my husband keeps hiding things from me cause he doesn't want me to worry which just ends up making me worry more
  ","
  Heh.. your so cute.. everyday you just keep getting cuter *Reaper tried to change the subject and tries reaching up to clink Genos teeth to distract him but when he moves, he visibly winces and ends up burying his skull back into Genos chest* ow..!
  "
1665,"
   I'm glad it helped *though Geno's worried about it only being a ""little"" better*
  ","
  *Reaper then looks up at him with half drooping eye sockets and tries to give a smile* ..S-sorry about..that.. I'll work on trying to handle it better..  that bear really messed me up.. *he then wraps his arm over Genos shoulder* s-so..how've you been doing Love..?
  "
1666,"
   *Geno uses his psychokinesis to get a life flower from their closet placing it on the God's ribcage*
  ","
  *The flower lights up and vanishes into a set of golden sparkles and Reaper seems a little more at ease as his tight grip on Genos sleeve loosens a bit and he let's himself lay against his Tsundere, he tried to hide how much pain he were in but he couldn't keep it up forever* ..That's..a little better.. t-thanks Love..
  "
1667,"
   What hurts?! Do you need a Life flower?!?
  ","
  ..*Reaper was now panting heavily as he shakily removes his hand off Genos sleeve to point at his ribcage before going back to gripping at his Tsuns sleeve* ..ggh..
  "
1668,"
   R-Reaper?!? *Geno's freaked, he just hugs Reaper wit his arm that the god isn't clinging off of* I'm right here, I'm not going anywhere *he whispers hoping his voice can be heard from whatever nightmare the Death god is trapped in*
  ","
  *Probably adding to Genos shock and horror, it turns out it wasn't a nightmare..the God of Death buries his skull into his Tsuns chest and keeps a tight hold onto his sleeve when his voice croaks out*
  
  ..G-Geno.. it..it hurts..
  "
1669,"
   *That woke Geno up, he'd managed to doze off bit Reaper scared him back to awareness* Reaper?!?
  ","
  *Oof, Reaper was now pulling on Genos sleeve, he seemed to be in a lot of pain with his bones now shaking as he held his eye sockets shut tight* G-Geno..!
  "
1670,"
   Which place do you find the most boring?
  ","
  *Probably scaring the heII out of poor Geno and interrupting his time to think, the next morning the God of Death is heard letting out a shrill shriek and
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  finds that Reapers hand was now gripping onto his sleeve as tight as he can, well if anything, they can't say it's boring to be at home that's for sure*

  Heh, I would so wanna see that *Reaper just grins* Ya know, I don't know much about your universe buut..I feel like I should the return the favor for helping me that time, I would of ended up with worse scrapes than this if you didn't show to help
  
  ..so if your ever in a jam, you can stop by and ask me for help
  "
1675,"
   I'm going to break the 4th wall here.  I'm Ask Opal. Cannon Opal is 99 percent human and 1 percent unknown.  It's that unknown part that gave the kids their music magic.  I'm usually the Helpful Anon, but not always.

  Ah, okay..didn't know Opal had alternate versions too..well, I guess I should of figured there would be since there's alternate versions of everyone else in the universe too, thanks for clearing that up

   What happened to y'all anyway, those injuries look pretty bad

  ..R-remember that bear you saved me from? This mostly came from him..though..facing off against Ganz didn't help it any..
  
  Ganz, that skeleton you mentioned..he's after the skeleton beside me, his names Geno..
  
  He uh.. happens to be married to me.. *Reaper blushed a bit* ..kinda hard to believe someone could love Death of all things.. but it happened..

1677,"
   Ganz, he shrieked when he realized his shadow was laughing at him

  Pfft!! *Reaper starts laughing although that caused him to wince and he grips onto
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  , Shadow may notice Reaper was a bit banged up, he had his left arm in a sling and bandages covering the top part of his robe while another skeleton beside him had to hold him up* ..O-ow..okay..remind me not to laugh.. but that was funny..it was worth hitting a funny bone or two..
  "
1678,"
   Yeah, thing is, I'm not fully human.  I'm 99 percent human and 1 percent Helpful anon.  My kids weirdly enough all have magic related to music.  Noah opens portals by singing.
  ","
  Huh..your part anon? Were..you the helpful anon that appeared all those times??
  
  Though if..you don't mind me asking..how'd your kiddos get music related powers?
  "
1679,"
   You shush
  ","
  Pfft, I'll take that as a yes *Reaper chuckled a bit* all it took was hanging out with you for a bit back in Solflare and I got you figured out now
  
  *he winks, he's actually joking with Nova*
  "
1680,"
   Most people tend not to pay their shadows much mind, though that does make it easy to mess with people. Like this one skeleton, he had a ghost with him I tried getting their attention as a shadow but they ignored me, so I just reached out and grabbed his ankle while he walked, hilarious
  ","
  Well I'd think the Grim Reaper would be differently than most people, with the job I have you deal with paranormal things all the time, demons, spirits, but you said you met a skeleton with a ghost with him? Huh..I have a few skeletons I know of that have those, would that skeletons name happen to be Cross or Ganz? *Reaper was already chuckling at the thought of either of them getting spooked by their own shadow*
  "
1681,"
   Nope, my Son Noah can, though.
  ","
  You have kiddos with powers? *Reaper just blinks, he was pretty surprised*
  "
1682,"
   I got here after your confusion to provide an exposition on Opal’s revival curse
  ","
  Or it's cause your secretly a big softie and had to make sure Opal was safe and followed her here, am I right?
  "
1683,"
   Yup, hey you bothered to remember a shadow like myself, I'm touched *his tone is teasing*
  ","
  *Reaper chuckled a bit* A talking Shadow would be pretty hard to forget, don't ya think? *he winks* Besides, how can I forget a kiddo that saved Death of all people? Most would of seen the Grim Reaper and leave him for dead ya know
  "
1684,"
   Vampires are undead humans
  ","
  What..? *Reaper looks confused now*
  "
1685,"
   Are you serious? You think vampires are demon crows? What is wrong with you
  ","
  Crows eat the corpses of the dead and feast on their decaying bones and blœd
  
  Sounds like something demonic no?
  
  And if your the unlucky person to get attacked by a whole swarm of crows, they will literally rip the skin off your bones, kind of fitting that they're attracted to the Grim Reaper..
  "
1686,"
   Opal: *sticks her head back through the portal.  Nope, I'm not. :D
  ","
  *Reaper blinks a few times to make sure he actually saw Opal open a portal and poke her head through it* You can make portals too??
  "
1687,"
   So someone like myself would be fine? *the Shade is just floating in the air behind him*
  ","
  Huh? *Reaper turns to look behind him and spots the shade floating in the air* Hey, aren't you Shadow? That kiddo that helped me escape that crazy bear?
  "
1688,"
   I didn’t mention her curse? Huh guess I’m so used to it I forget not everyone knows
  ","
  Wait what? *Reaper looks surprised to see Nova* What curse?? and..when did you get here?
  "
1689,"
   What about vampires?
  ","
  Vampires? Aren't they just demonic crows? They would easily die by my Death touch, demons can age too ya know
  
  *Wait what--what kind of vampire is he talking about--*
  "
1690,"
   Opal: *looks thoughtful* *touches you* *dies* *Respawns* Yup, it's a death touch... *takes her old body and leaves*
  ","
  Wait--wha--?? *Reaper looks shocked at what just happened* W-wait a minute--how--?? Uh..I thought you were a normal human..?
  "
1691,"
   How does your death touch work?
  ","
  ..I guess it's alright to explain it, my Death touch causes things to age rapidly, it doesn't affect anyone like Geno since he's unable to age, a normal monster dusts instantly when they come into contact with me and they can live up to thousands of years so a human would die instantly too
  "
1692,"
   I will bite you on the side of your neck to get blood.
  ","
  You do know I'm Death, right? If you even tried to bite me, my Death touch would instantly kiII you kiddo, so unless you want a early grave, I'd suggest ya don't

1693,"
   (You still need to be nice, but set boundaries.  No hugs, but I do love you)

  *Reaper looks really surprised to hear that* Um..y-you know I'm still Death, that's not something a lot of people say they love..but..I can try that..

1694,"
   (Positive encouragement and not screaming at them when they mess up. You can do this, I know you can)
  ","
  But..if I do be nice to them..then won't I end up dusting them? *Reaper actually shared this info with you, he must trust you now* Gothy and Sorell are reapers like me but the rest of the kiddos aren't, if I start treating any of them nicely..I could dust them just from a hug or..
  "
1695,"
   (I know you're trying, but you can't threaten them with Hell or Underfell)

  *Reaper frowned a bit* I don't know what else to do to get them to do things..

   (-_- Reaper, Reaper, Reaper...)

  Uh..*Reaper doesn't seem to know how to respond to that, he was actually blushing* your a literal angel? You look more like a bunny ..and uh..really not used to anyone calling me cute..I'm Death you know, the scary big bad Grim Reaper who reaps Souls?

1733,"
   You like if Geno calls you handsome

  *Reaper started blushing bright blue at that*..S-shush!

   Hello handsome~

  Don't worry about it..it's nothing..I'm gonna go try and make you something to eat now..*Reaper sluggishly heads towards the kitchen*

  We did but..*Reaper pauses again, he doesn't want to tell Geno everything so he's gone silent*

1743,"

1745,"
   Wasn't the guy who dressed up as you Ganz

  I don't exactly have proof but I've had a feeling it was Ganz running around as me..who else would do that? Besides..that outfit looks nothing like me..*Reaper folds his arms*

1746,"

  ","
  *Reaper walks over and opens the door after he hears someone knocking on it and he's thrown off by the disguise, he's seen that outfit before but he truly thought it was a different monster at the time, he has no idea its Ganz under there at least not yet* ..Aren't you that weirdo me and Geno ran into during our first trip to the surface? How the heII are you here? *kinda surprised he remembered that when it happened so many years ago*

1748,"
   You make it sound like I went missing or something?
  ","
  ..It's..it's nothing..*Reapers a little shocked and hurt Geno didn't notice he was gone at all but he decides its probably better he doesn't know anything about what happened* just go get some rest..you didn't say anything but you probably need it..I can handle myself..*he then pulls away from their hug*

1749,"
   Reaper, you there? *Geno legit waves his hand in front of Reaper's face*

   You look like you've seen a ghost

  Geno..?? *Reaper looks back over his shoulder when he hears Geno, he looks shocked to see him*

  Don't got hair and really don't care but I do have my cute Geno~

1754,"

  You look more like you've been eating lemons for a living, that would explain the sour attitude and why your whole mouth is yellow *XD poor Zukin* Or maybe you eat Zukini- pfft!

1755,"
   I'm a devil! Or well um demon. I'm from a place that makes here look cute in comparison! *tail wags spreading his  wings hes  red  all over with lighter red highlights.*You may call me Kukin~  *hes either a child or teenager lol*
  ","
  You definitely aren't a cute kiddo that's for sure..nice wings but you don't look all that scary, you look more like a garden gnome..is your place made out gnomes? That would be worse than here *Reaper noo bad!*
  "
1756,"
   My age is irrelevant! Hehe! Hey grimmy~
  ","
  Grimmy? *Reaper raises a invisible eyebrow* Riiigghht...why do I have a feeling we aren't going to get along? What kinda monster are you?

  Uh...well...you've got me stumped kiddo..I haven't seen anyone with a power like that..or any skeleton with that many eyes except..*Reaper shivered a bit when he thought about Socket* anyway..that ability of yours would make reaping a whole lot easier

1759,"
   The dead and I have a very close connection.. They help me  and I help them.  We are one and the same but I can freely walk around outside this bleak place.

  *Reaper looks pretty surprised at that answer* That's new.. what do you mean by that kiddo?

1760,"
   *she looks confused* That's a point scythe you got there.

  Yeah, I'm the literal Grim Reaper *Reaper walks towards her with his scythe in his hand* kinda surprised you aren't running away or screaming in fear right now

  Other Links?

1764,"
   Hello..?

  *Reaper looks over when he heard someone say hello* Huh? Uh, hey kiddo..you do know your greeting Death, right?

1765,"
   Shadow is a reformed villain, he's trying to be a hero but has trouble with it due to his destructive instincts
  ","
  ..So we are alike in a way.. *Reaper looks at the ground at his own shadow* he was a villain? Or was he just seen as a villain?
  "
1766,"
   *Shadow has to look for awhile but he finds a shadow cast in Reapertale he pulls the god of Death out into his timeline and waves farewell from his shadow on the ground*
  ","
  *Reaper looks pretty surprised when he looked around for where Shadow went and noticed his own shadow actually waving at him, he waves back when it clicked that he wasn't joking about being a literal shadow*
  
  ..Kinda weird how that kiddo reminded me of myself...
  "
1767,"
   Well you can't exactly kill a shadow, so I'm guessing you would probably like to emerge from the shadows back wherever you call home. Just gimme a description and I'll get y'all on your way
  ","
  Your literally a shadow? You mean..we're literally in the shadows? *Reaper takes another look around* I thought that was a figure of speech..we aren't in that dark world you said your from?  You know..for someone claiming to be from a dark world, you don't act all that dark if your wanting to help me of all people..even if I can't kiII you Death isn't exactly someone anyone would like.. I come from a place called ReaperTale, it's where all the Souls of the dead go.. *the God does his best to describe what ReaperTale looks like, telling of the destroyed buildings and dead trees and plants*
  "
1768,"
   *The Shade is floating in front of him* Name's Shadow, demon from the Dark world, and another being that crazy bear has taken an interest in. Right now we're IN the shadows, he can't reach you here
  ","
  Shadow? Names Reaper, like my name says, I'm the literal Grim Reaper, n-not that I needed the help but..thanks for that back there..*Reaper rubs the back of his skull nervously* not exactly used to anyone not fearing literal Death.. and I thought we all lived in a dark world *he winks to try and show he was joking*
  "
1769,"
   *Suddenly hands emerge from the shadows and grab Reaper pulling him into the freezing darkness* Jeez this bear is really bothering y'all isn't he
  ","
  *
  
   @Remnantsofdespair
  
  sorry but looks like your plan failed*
  
  Huh--!? *Reaper was caught by surprise and looks around to see who grabbed him, he was shocked by the cold but does his best not to show it* Wait..where?? Who's there??
  "
1770,"
   my paws on the others, they'll be trapped here along with you and forced to participate in the games! What do you think I've been doing this whole time? I've been watching and observing my future students! That's how I knew the perfect time to grab you!
  ","
  *Reaper then summons his blue magic imbued chains that spring up from the ground and wrap around Monokuma, pinning the bear to the ground* I'll just destroy this entire place with you along with it then.. no matter how many copies you have, I'll destroy them all, your messing with literal Death..don't you know Death is something you should fear?  You won't keep me here..
  "
1771,"
   *But when he teleports he finds himself right back at the Academy with Monokuma laughing*
AHAHAHA!!!! Did you really think I'd go through all this trouble JUST to have you leave? I took a sample of your magic and put it inside a special machine of mine! Now you can't leave and as soon as I get tbc
  ","
  *Reaper pauses when he sees he's right back at the place he tried to get away from and stares back at Monokuma in shock* How..?!
  "
1772,"
   liquid in it and it has a pulse just like a human heart
This is what keeps you freaks alive isn't it? There is a way to kill you after all! Isn't there? *Monokuma gives a rather dark grin, he looks almost sadistic*
  ","
  *Reaper gets back up to his ""feet"" and glares at the animatronic bear* That might be true for normal monsters but the Grim Reaper is different, you can do whatever you want to my Soul but it won't kiII me..you can't kiII Death ..it's not possible..and I'm not staying here *he then teleports away*
  "
1773,"
   Didn't I warn you about what happens when you do that!? *the bear explodes on impact and sends you flying through a wall with another Monokuma appearing to take it's place* Ugh your going to be a difficult student to deal with that's for sure, but this upside down heart thing has some sort of tbc
  ","
  *Reaper definitely forgot about Monokuma having a built in bomb and he gets surprised when he's thrown back through a wall* Oof!
  "
1774,"
   *I ran out of space*
*After having him set up on the table, he straps the skeleton down, removing the top of his clothes and stabs a needle into his soul to get a magic sample from him*
I wonder what that heart thing is, that zombie guy called it a soul I believe? Is this what keeps you alive?
  ","
  *Reaper winces after he felt something stab his Soul which caused a rush of pain to wake him up, he opens his eye sockets and looks around to see he was clearly not in ReaperTale anymore* Ow..! What the heII..!? *he then noticed Monokuma staring down at him and immediately teleports out of the straps and slices Monokuma in half with his scythe*
  "
1775,"
   Phuhuhu!! Upupu!! This is even better than I've hoped! Now let's see、if I'm going to make this game so your not able to just teleport and leave, I'm going to have to run a few tests on you *The bear once at the now built Hopes Peak Academy, carries him into a science lab and props him up on a table*
  ","
  *I'll answer on the next one*
  "
1776,"
   *While the reaper were unconscious, this was the perfect time for Monokuma to grab him, several mono-bots waltz in and carry him off through a portal*
I told everyone I always get whatever I want! Your going to be a new student of mine whether you want to or not!
  ","
  *Reaper is completely unaware of what's happening, he's been out cold for a while since the last fight he's been in, so he has no idea he's just been taken*
  "
1777,"
   back to normal!
  ","
  *Reaper will definitely appreciate that when he wakes up, their kids didn't exactly take them seriously when they turned into dogs*

1778,"
   I won't treat you like a dog, reaper.  But I will admit, you make a cute puppo

  *Reaper didn't seem to notice Geno was back to normal, at least not yet and he just nuzzles into his Tsuns hoodie, falling asleep on him*

1781,"

  ..Yeah..I just never celebrated it before..there wasn't a point to..but ..your mom is starting to change my mind about it..*Reaper smiled slightly* ..someone told me a long ago that the stars can't be seen without the darkness behind them..your mom is proof of that..he's the light in the darkness..

  Hey, I'm not gonna say no if you wanna cuddle for a change *Reaper just nuzzles Geno, he knows he isn't okay* How about we go back on vacation when your up for it? We didn't get to do those swimming lessons like you promised

  ..Geno..*Unfortunately Reaper doesn't know all the little details either, this is the first he's heard about it*..we both promised that you becoming Error wouldn't happen..right? ..Plus that's just a alternate timeline..doesn't mean ours will play out the same way..besides..I wouldn't stop looking for you if you vanished..I'd search the ends of the multiverse for you..

  ..What stuff? Geno..you know you can always talk to me..Death won't bite..unless you ask him to~ *Reaper winks to try and lighten the mood a bit*

  *Reaper wasn't actually asleep, he just wanted to see what Geno would do if he faked falling asleep right then and there, he was expecting him to say something along the lines of ""I didn't say you could sleep here"" and shoving him off, he's honestly surprised when he doesn't hear him say anything like that*...hmn? Geno?

   Then get some sleep you dork *he laughs slightly*

  Don't mind if I do~ *Reaper then closes his eyes and..did he really fall asleep while standing up? Yes he did, he was dozing off on Geno while still standing*

   Well good on you for winning but a fight in our own house? new year more of the same bs

  Not necessarily, we don't have a whole army after us like last year, a fight here and there we can handle, I just need a Death nap now..*Reaper lays his skull down on Genos shoulder*

1837,"
   No, let's not. So what was all that noise earlier anyway

  ...I may or may not of gotten into a fight..but the good news is, I won..*Reaper seems proud of that fact even if he's a little banged up from it*

  Aw..but I like carrying you around~ *Reaper winks*

  How Geno sees Reaper*
  "
1845,"
   Haha... Harmless? Does a harmless person scar you? Like she did to me? Does a harmless person try to destroy everything you hold dear? Maybe I need a refresher..  She's no better then the resistance.. I  suggest you let me pass. Now.
  ","
  She scarred you? I'm pretty sure you have Neo confused for her cousin, I can't speak for him but I know Neo pretty well and she really is harmless..I would let you pass if I knew for sure that you weren't going to harm or take her..*he holds his scythe in front of Korma*

  ran off to..*
  "
1848,"
   Does it look like I care what you think? All I care about are what Geno and Sensy think~ If they don't agree with it, I'll just drug them, I already drug Sensy so he has no idea what's going on~ *the chains break from the blast and he teleports behind Death firing several bones to knock him back*
  ","
  *Reaper quickly summons his scythe to his hands and slashes the bones along with Ganz right in half since he moved pretty close near Reaper, his scythe had enough range to nail him* ..I really hate that guy..
  "
1849,"
   Hmn..I think I'll have to decline that offer, even if you do dust me I've proven I'll just come right back afterwards, perks of working with Nightmare, at least temporarily, he finds it really entertaining that me and you both want Geno
*He has his spare blaster fire at Death*
  ","
  *Reaper braces himself and summons his own blaster to deflect the attack and fire back at Ganz, yes he has his own blaster in the shape of a birds skull, he doesn't use it often though* Tch..let's see..you kiII other Papyruses, your working for Nightmare, your already married and you want another husband  on top of the one you have which neither Geno or Sensy are okay with..sounds like that'll go over real well..
  "
1850,"
   *He moves his second blaster in front him to catch the scythe and hurl it back at Death* Didn't you hear what I said? I have some dirt I planted on you and once he sees it, he'll believe he made the wrong choice going with you~ Now all I have to do is take him from you right now, where is he?
  ","
  Now who's th--Sh-t!! *Reaper fumbles to the ground as he dodges his scythe being hurled back at him, something was wrong, he isn't normally this clumsy, was having his wings damaged throwing him off?**he summons his blue magic imbued chains shortly after hitting the ground to tie Ganz and his blaster down together* I don't care whatever the heII you think will happen, I know my Geno and he wouldn't fall for any sort of trick, he'll see through anything you have planned..now before this argument turns into a full blown battle..I'm giving you one chance to leave before I send you back to your timeline in a dust jar!
  "
1851,"
   *Ganz has his blaster bite down on the chains to break him free so he teleports back to his feet* What's it look like dumbaşş? I'm here to try and win Genos soul again~ He can't refuse this time! Not when he sees what I've had you do~
I'd stay away from the surface world for a while~
  ","
  ..Ganz? Not this sh-t again..*Reaper was honestly surprised Ganz managed to break through his chains like that and he summons his scythe shortly after and hurls it at him* You don't give up do you? How many times do we need to say it!? Geno doesn't want to be with you and you can't force him to! *the last bit Ganz said it didn't seem like Reaper paid any attention to it*
  "
1852,"
   *Ganz teleports in their house and shoves Death to the ground with his blaster, he knows physically touching Death himself would result with him in a pile of dust* Where's the cutie at?

  ..*Reaper then takes out his scythe and slices Monokuma in half again-* How the heII did you even get here!?
  "
1862,"
   She's a threat to Irken's, Wra and all aliens alike.. She's the cousin of the resistance leader.. Nexion and Neo  need to be turned in.. Maybe you might reconsider? They have quite the bounty on their heads. I'll pay you handsomely....
  ","
  Have you seen Neo? All she does is try to hug everyone she sees and drools over herself, I think her cousin is the one your after, I'd have no problem handing him over if I saw him but Neo is the harmless one ..plus your problems don't really concern me, I don't really have a reason to help you here *Reaper shrugs* I do have a reason to defend that alien though
  "
1863,"
   Be grateful i'm not after you..  My armor is the best that Irk can provide. Strong like the metals used on fleets and some voot cruisers but light  enough not to weight me down.
  ","
  Well, you happen to be after a friend of mine so this does kinda involve me..*Reaper frowned at her* That armor is impressive I'll give you that much but it's no match against me..meaning I won't let you just waltz in and grab Neo..so word of advice, maybe turn around and double check what alien your after..
  "
1864,"
   What meal do you cook best?
  ","
  *Reaper was just waking up and let out a yawn before rubbing his eye sockets* ..cooking? I leave that mostly to Geno..since..I'm not exactly the best at it..
  "
1865,"
   *it doesnt work very  well but if he touched it for long enough it would rust up and maybe eventually crumble but it would take days* What are you doing? *the spot her touches changes colors but is otherwise fine*
  ","
  I was seeing if that armor of yours could handle my Death touch, I'm literal Death kiddo so whatever I touch usually breaks, rusts or dies..you must have some decent armor, my Death touch didn't destroy it after tapping it, depending on the type of metal, it could rust in minutes or take up to a week for me to break it
  "
1866,"
   ok that was sweet
  ","
  You called me sweet?~ *Reaper has the biggest grin on his face now*
  "
1867,"
   That's what she wants you to think...  Her kind are menaces scum of the universe i'm from. I need to bring her to justice..  Also.. This is armor.. *taps its a type of foreign alien metal*
  ","
  *Reaper then taps Kornas armor, would his Death touch affect it?* I don't think you've seen Neo, maybe you confused her with another alien but she really is harmless, honestly she gets murdered all the time here, she wanders into the wrong people..if it wasn't for the device she has, she wouldn't be here right now..
  "
1868,"
   They have breaking codes, destroying irken fleets, and causing chaos across the multiverse.. They need to be stopped. That's why they sent the best of the best, me. *closes hologram*

  ..Okay, that makes more sense why your so small..your one of those irkens..your outfit threw me off there but I think you have the wrong alien,  that alien you showed me is more harmless than a fly, she isn't capable of destroying anything

   AHEM!! How rude!! You can't just LEAVE like that!! Where's the other dead guy anyway? Where did you freaks even head off to!? How big is this place!?

1879,"
   Ahem..I really REALLY recommend you use some common sense and LET ME FINISH DAMMIT!! *a couple mono-bears appear behind the scythe weilding skeleton and tackle him to the ground* YOU INTERRUPT AGAIN AND I'LL BLOW YOU SKY HIGH!! I don't care if you really ARE Death! I am making a SCHOOL you dimwit!

  *Reaper gets tackled to the ground but has his chains hurl Monokuma into the floor with him*
  
  A School? What the heII is a school!? *Right..Reaper is from ancient times, ancient Greece to be more exact, so he doesn't know much that's modern in today's world* and for the record, only GENO can call me a dimwit! I'm his idiot!

  But--*Reaper isn't okay with having Geno put in danger but..after all they've been through, it's pretty clear he can't handle fighting alone* Just..be careful, okay Love? I'm not sure what exactly this thing is..
  "
1882,"
   But then again, I haven't seen anyone capable of using real life magic before without strings or mirrors, that scythe and chains seemed preeetttyy real
They chopped my beautiful copies into bits! *there were now 2 destroyed mono-bots laying on the ground*

  ..So your a type of machine? That makes more sense now..how your able to come back after blowing up like that...you have more duplicates built..I'll just have to destroy them all then..*Reaper then summons more blue magic imbued chains the spring up around the bear and pin him down* My family is on vacation..I'm not tolerating anyone barging in and ruining it..
  "
1883,"
   Now let the headmaster speak!! You should listen to your friend there who..already looks dead!? *The mono bear turns to the half dead skeleton* We didn't even start the game yet!! How are you already dying!?!? Actually how can a skeleton bleed like that? Are you really just kids in costumes? Tbc

   I'm no ordinary bear if that's what your asking but that's not really important right now! What IS important is to get some new students to test out how an Academy would work here!

  Don't worry about it..*Reapers voice doesn't sound the same either, he sounds far more serious and..malevolent in a way, you can't quite put your finger on it but he has a more sinister tone of voice that would send chills down your spine, almost like if you were facing Nightmare right now*

  I was planning to use it before I made that wish with that weird guy in my dreams..*Reapers blue eyelight has a ominous purple glow to it now, that could be good or bad* if that wish actually works then I won't need to try my first idea..

2183,"
   Hello mr!
  ","
  Uh..who..? *Reaper then kneels down to the kiddo* You know, most people wouldn't walk up to Death himself like that.. you have guts kiddo..

2184,"
   Hey Reaper when you wake up you should probably gather your kids and get them home, lest Geno try and do that himself, he's in no state to be up and about but you know how stubborn he is

  ..*Reaper had just woken up and started rubbing his eye sockets when he heard you*
  
  Wat..? Oh..right...forgot..the kiddos are still at the hospital..g-give me a minute..I'm pretty tired..

   Yeah I could use some rest

2191,"
   I was scared, I was worried I'd lose you

  ..Heh..guess we were both worry warts..*Reaper tries to lighten things a bit and gives a faint chuckle* but..you still shouldn't have Reset ..I wouldn't have been gone permanently but you...

  *You..what?*

2197,"
   *Geno kinda nodded off so he didn't hear Reaper worrying... though just falling asleep so suddenly might spook Reaper at the moment*
  ","
  *It honestly did scare the God to Death and he takes a DT needle out of his robe and stabs Genos arm with it, that would of hurt he didn't do it gently since he was in a panic, that's.. a little concerning why he had a DT needle carried around in his pocket..at least that should actually help Geno since he runs off DT more than magic, if he relied on magic alone I don't think he'd be able to function*
  "
2198,"
   That's what I just said..! I-I'm happy your not dusting anymore but mom shouldn't of Reset like that!! You said he could turn into Uncle Error if he does! *Goth then rushes over beside his mom, hopping on top of the bed so he can sit beside him*
  ","
  ..*Reaper is seen shaking in place as he held Geno in his arms* Gothy..Gods can't permanently die unless their Soul is destroyed.. I wouldn't of worried too much about me.. as long as my Soul is in one piece there's a chance I can be revived without needing a Reset..same with you kiddos..
  
  But your mom..if anything happened to him..there's no chance of bringing him back at all.. if he ever became Error..it would be irreversible.. a Reset can only work if there's a timeline to use it on..your mom lost his timeline.. a Reset is no longer possible to bring him back from the dead..it works with everyone else here since they still have a timeline..but your moms timeline was entirely erased with no trace left behind..you can't go there or access it at all..it's gone..entirely.. anything that happens to him..could be permanent..*he clings onto

  What..? *Reaper looks back at Goth who he didn't even notice was there* Gothy?? W-what do you mean by--*he then looks down at his robe and sure enough, he discovers his injuries are gone along with his robe being covered in dusty powder which made his lone eye turn huge* ....He Reset..didn't he?
  "
2201,"
   *all he gets in response is a mumble*

  *Reaper just nuzzles him as he held him close, he's now very worried about his Tsundere* ..Love..you already messed around enough today..you shouldn't be wandering off like that..you'll work yourself down to the bone..

  "
2207,"
   Sh-t!! Dad!? He really can die!? W-wait! *Goth in a complete panic rushes over to his dads side and starts sharing his magic with him to try and keep him stable enough that he stops dusting* Crap crap crap..! You can't just đie like this!! What was that whole speech about being invincible!?

   He guides the souls of the dead to the next life, without him souls will be trapped in limbo forever. Never able to move on, unable to interact with the world or with anyone, even other deceased souls. Then they'll fade out of existence entirely. THAT is what will happen if you ""pull the plug""

  *Reaper looks completely helpless as he squirms around in the robots arms, his Death touch takes a while to eat away at metal and he's exhausted all of his magic, his Soul has just enough left to keep him functioning, Fang really threw him off by giving the monster he was sent to reap high tech guns and a hover board which Reaper has never had to deal with before, modern technology puts him at a disadvantage since he's from ancient Greece, he's used to fighting others with magic or old style weapons like swords or spears, not with machine guns, flying bikes and explosives* D-damn it..

You burn me, I burn you! Capiche

2331,"
   Ow!!! *Life does in fact drop Reaper after she were nailed in the arm and begins to heal her arm afterwards* I had forgotten I had him..but you hadn't need to strike me! That was entirely unnecessary..!

  ..*Reaper is too awe struck by Geno to answer but seriously you didn't notice him coughing or yelling?*

2332,"
   *maybe he faked it a little too well as Geno summons a sharp bone which nails Life in the arm forcing her to drop Reaper* *Geno's eye is still lit up* you alright?
  ","
  *Reaper did NOT see that coming, when he drops to the ground he can't help but blush dark blue when he stares up at his Tsundere, he isn't used to seeing Geno be so protective like that, he was actually speechless*
  
  ...U-um..
  "
2333,"
   LIFE PUT HIM DOWN!

  G-Geno..! *Reaper then reaches a arm out to his Tsun, he was honestly faking this so Life will set him down but neither of them know that*

  *Reaper takes the cough wrong though and looks at Geno with a worried look in his eye* A-are you okay..!?

   Better, I'm doing better now. You have to stop scaring me like this though.

  Sorry Love, I don't mean to scare you to Death..*Reaper just gives him a smile* it's nice to know you worry about me though~ means you still love me

2340,"
   You WERE pretending that you didn't hear me!! *Life then grabs Reaper and lifts him up by the back of his robe until they're face to face* It's VERY hard to be kind to you right now! How dare you do that you ungrateful disrespectful little--*she then summons a fireball in her free hand* I saved you!

  I wasn't pretending..I can kinda hear things now but it's not 100%..can you set me down now? Not to be Death defying..but this is starting to hurt..

  Who do you think?

   ..I'll take the silence as a no..*Life then goes out of her way to write something down on a blank scroll and show it to Reaper, when he reads it, it says: ""I expect a full thank you for my services and a apology for how you both behaved, I swear if your faking being deaf I will punch you""

  ..*Reaper takes the scroll and it instantly falls apart in his hands due to his death touch but he did that on purpose so he won't get into it with Life*

2344,"
   Hmph..there your fine now..*Life stops when she makes sure he was really awake* You owe me Death..I would like a full apology and a thank you..I didn't have to aid you, you know! *she then gets up* are you able to hear us now?

  Thanks Ink.. ..y-you know the kiddo, Radier? H-he showed up with Ganz.. he didn't fight alone this time..so I'm pretty roughed u-up.. if it was just Ganz..I could of h-handled it but..I fought them both..if it weren't for G-Geno..I'd be a lot worse than this..

Nice try, but you failed, now to get Geno to myself and hey I'll even grab that girl that kid is after for helping me out like this~

2418,"

   You sure about that? He's not the only one here! I came here to take back my toy you keep stealing from me! *A nightmare arm stops his scythe from hitting Ganz and throws it out of his hands* Hand over Shino..I'm bored without my toy..

  You'll have to kiII me first!

2421,"
   Mel: It's called we know your dumbaşş will do anything to protect him even if it costs you this battle so we dont have to worry about hitting him when he has a bodyguard

2422,"
   You really think you'll get rid of me that easy? As long as I have my Frisk or someone capable of resets in my timeline I'll always come back *He charges up a beam in his hand that breaks through the chains and blasts Death through the wall* now hand over Geno or your wings come off

Geno is no one's property and you should of learned from the last time we ran into eachother that you should leave us both the f-ck alone..*he then summons his blue magic imbued chains in his hands that wrap around Ganz* I know reaping you doesn't do any good so maybe I'll toss you into the void with Error..~

2462,"
   How did you learn how to put someone in Limbo? Is that just like a modified version of your Death touch? an Undeath touch?
  ","
  ..It is kinda like what you said..Asgore explained I have that ability in case of emergencies..like say for example every single different version of Dream that exists all start dying from their Nightmares, it would plunge this whole multiverse into chaos and it would be a call for me to use my powers and trap the remaining Dreams into limbo so positive emotions aren't completely wiped from existence.. the other versions of me would have to do the same to stop the catastrophe
  "
2463,"
   Well you didn't always skip work, or we would have never met, we can go home if this is too much....
  ","
  ..To them skipping one day at all was a lot.. at least Paps had a good life..me on the other hand..not so much *Reaper then slumps against Geno* Paps didn't even have to do his job, he was just so eager to help everyone he willingly took on reaping..they gave him the job of taking the Souls of animals who died..he went a step further wanting to help me out and took the Souls of humans and monsters who wanted to die..but he couldn't bring himself to take the lives of the ones who didn't want to go, which is why I'm still here..I do the harder jobs where people fight back against Death while he gets the easier ones ..if you remember, you were afraid I'd kiII you when we first met and fought against me.. if you fully accepted Death right off the bat, we wouldn't of gotten that chance to talk, my brother would of been the one there to take you away..
  
  ..Kinda funny..I'm dead tired just from being here..

2464,"
   Do you judge people based on their knowledge of grammar?
  ","
  Nah, Geno doesn't judge me for not knowing much or misspelling a few things so why should I judge somebody else?
  "
2465,"
   *Geno just hugs him* and I thought my Gaster was bad...
  ","
  *Reaper looks back up at Geno though his blue eyelight is gone from sight now*
  
  ..Heh..yours is still bad Love..they're both about the same level of horrible.. just.. when I was a kiddo..I used to have emotions..when they created me to be the God of Death..I hated it, I didn't want my powers to kiII everything I touched..I hated everything about it.. I didn't want the job I was made for and didn't want to be the God of Death.. when I saw everything I tried to interact with died or crumbled away in my hands.. it hurt.. I literally couldn't walk anywhere without kiIIing everything in my path..I fought against my entire job..told them I didn't want it.. so Gaster took me here, saying I had no choice..and beat the heII out of me until I grew to no longer feel anything and be this cold and heartless God of Death they needed..but the thing is it didn't go like he thought it would..I was heartless alright but I didn't care about anyone or anything anymore including the job I was supposed to do..I skipped work a lot so they made Painless as my replacement..but he was even more flawed than I was..he refused to reap anything period..but they got attached to Paps because of him being..well..him.. so he stuck around and earned the title of Painless Death..they kept me around cause I was at least doing the job I was made for just not how they wanted me to.. ..I would skip work a lot.. ..

  *The first thing Geno may notice is the living room had instead of a green couch there was a wooden bench and a couple wooden tables but no TV or sticky notes like in the other timelines, upstairs he sees that what was supposedly Reapers room, was made into a small closet, you see a broom leaning against some empty shelves but under the shelves is a crawl space where you see a filthy black robe laying there on the ground covered in dust, dirt and who knows what else, the God of Death visibly shrinks and tries to hide himself into Genos shoulder*
  "
2467,"
   *Geno wraps an arm around one of Reaper's* Hey if you're not comfortable with this that's ok, we can go home
  ","
  *Reaper looked over at his Tsundere in surprise and wrapped both his arms around Genos, he was actually trembling, Geno might be in shock to see Reaper actually shrink down and act afraid when he's nearly fearless* J-just have a few bad memories here.. if you can deal with yours then..I should be able to deal with mine.. besides..I'm not alone here..*he gives a faint smile*
  "
2468,"
   So you're actually going to let me look around here?
  ","
  *Reaper nods though he seemed really uncomfortable, he was visibly gripping at his arms* ..
  
  Y-yeah.. *he keeps a close eye on Geno to see what part of this ancient house he travels to, if you know a lot about ancient Greece their houses were made of stone, Gasters home looked just like one of those old buildings only more in the style of Classic Sans and Paps home, meaning the layout of the house was similar, the kitchen and bedrooms were all in the same area*
  "
2469,"
   I think you should probably show me
  ","
  *Reaper then takes Geno by the hand and teleports off to a place in ReaperTale that they've only seen briefly, it was a house that belonged to Gaster, the God of magic, Reaper was actually going to let Geno see everything*
  
  ..You remember I took us here to hide out for a bit? ..I didn't let you look around the place since..there was a few things I wanted to keep hidden..but.. I think you'll get why I act the way I do if I let you see it..
  "
2470,"
   I'd figured that out as well, and maybe you can get away with taking things from the dead, since there aren't a ton of resources here. But don't terrorize the living to get free things
  ","
  You knew? Here I thought I hid it...though I honestly didn't see a difference between taking from the living or dead..nobody here has ever said anything to me about it...*Reaper then gets a more serious look and his blue eyelight vanished* ..but..I did live a lot differently than the other Gods here and other Sans.. I can show you what I mean by that ..if your up for it
  "
2471,"
   I kinda know about the polyamory considering Life tried sleeping with me remember...
  ","
  ..Yeah..don't remind me..*Reaper frowned a bit* ..but the Gods here are all like that.. our Frisk even flirts with me and with Chara.. I don't know what the heII is wrong with them..
  
  ..Anyway..it's also completely okay to take things from other timelines.. I asked before I swiped what I have from the monsters and humans I've reaped and everyone said it was completely fine..
  
  *He then holds up his cellphone* Everything we have, I took from a monster or human I reaped..here we don't have the same tech all the other timelines have..the only reason our house does is cause I've took it all from various AUs.. nobody aside from me and Painless know what cellphones are..
  "
2472,"
   I know your timeline is very different from most, but I need a sense of how different so I can tell you what you should do in your typical timeline. I already know you don't use gold here
  ","
  ..You mean you wanna know everything about our timeline? You know, it's your timeline too now, you can say ours, you live here right along with me *Reaper gives a smile*
  
  Though..there's a few things about timeline you might not like..for instance it's completely okay here for all the Gods to have multiple husbands or wives.. but I know you wouldn't be okay with that and I don't exactly wanna share you either..

2473,"
   checking for a fever, When Paps was younger I'd always do this if he wasn't feeling well *he has a somewhat sad smile*
  ","
  *Reaper then hugs him* Can't say I know what that's like but I do know it isn't easy for you to talk about the past..you don't have to bring it up if it makes you upset..you do have me, the kiddos and Painless now if that helps, none of us want you upset Love

2475,"

  ","
  *Lol he did feel really warm but it wasn't because of a fever, it was because he started blushing though it would be funny if Geno mistook it as he had a fever* Uhh..what are you..? *Reaper stares at his Tsun looking confused*

2476,"
   *Geno blinks* You're actually admitting to needing help?
  ","
  *That is pretty shocking for Reaper to admit that, almost makes you wonder if he's ill, he never asks let alone admit to needing help*
  
  *He then folded his arms and darts his lone eyelight away from Geno* ..N-no..maybe..a little..? Just.. I don't understand everything like you do..
  "
2477,"
   I don't remember them being that crazy either to be honest... I think it was mostly Goth who had that influence
  ","
  *Reaper sighs* Okay..maybe your right then..maybe I am teaching them the wrong things..but..
  
  *he looks away from Geno* ..I-I honestly..don't know how to behave.. I never had a family or anyone with me before.. we don't use gold here in ReaperTale either..and in the timelines I went reaping in, nobody ever said it was wrong to just take things off the people I've reaped..I-I'm trying to say..I might..actually need your help..

2479,"
   How am I supposed to relax?! Remember the chaos Goth caused when he got that Elven woman's robot? All because of the behavior YOU taught him

  Hey, hey! So I maybe taught the kiddo to behave more violently and taught them stealing was okay but ..okay that sounded worse when it's said out loud..

   How were you able to get away with erasing Geno's memories of Silver, Sorell AND Raven??
  ","
  Simple, nobody other than Geno and myself knew about Silver and Sorell so I dumped them off into another timeline and erased Genos memory of them, the fell brothers caught me trying to dump Raven off at their house though which made things complicated..they didn't want him there especially after the last 2 I dropped off..so I had to let Raven stay half with my brother and half with the fells, I convinced my bro that Raven was Life Paps kiddo who needed a babysitter from time to time, he completely bought it and started calling Raven his kiddo
  
  Imagine his shock when he found out the truth..*My God Death--*

  Okkaaayy maybe it's a little more serious than I said but I'd still say it's a small deal..I think I should probably tell you the full story of how I brought her back the first time around..it's a long story but I'll try to cut it short
  
  *I'm gonna try putting the comic in order and before anyone asks the reason Life flowers can only revive Life is because it's giving her her own magic back, she created them with her magic so if you shatter one, it releases her magic trapped inside and gives it back to her, Reaper still ended up having to give her magic afterwards since she wasn't fully back to normal, but due to them being exact opposites of eachother, it took him years to do it solo, his magic isn't compatible with hers and with Nova, if anyone remembers, Reaper had no more Life flowers on him, he was basically screwed and had to hope that Nova could revive her without using one*

  "
2627,"
   What are the rules you have to follow?
  ","
  ..I said a couple of them already but I'm guessing your wanting to know the whole list..
  
  Well, like I said, not being with mortals is a rule we're supposed to follow since..well, think about it, we're immortal, we would outlive anyone we went with outside of ReaperTale..
  
  That's a huge fear I had with Geno..it led me to break the second rule of not being allowed to put anyone in limbo..I have the power to make others immortal but I'm not supposed to use it.. if I did that for everyone, not only would it make my whole job entirely pointless but it would plunge the whole multiverse into total chaos, everyone would think it's okay to do whatever the heII they want since nothing you do will cause any harm, at least that's how everyone would see it, there would be nonstop violence..
  
  That goes along with not being allowed to alter someone's fate or change timelines, if I decided to change Nightmare and Dreams AU for example, and reap everyone there or decided to just flat out kiII Nightmare before he became the Nightmare we know today, it could have some disastrous effects.. Dream could become a villain seeking vengeance for one..it's just something we aren't supposed to do..
  
  I'm also not allowed to let anyone take my scythe, if you get ahold of mine or my brothers scythe it gives anyone the power to reap Souls and to kiII us Gods..that weapon is powerful and in the wrong hands, as seen with Chara..it can be a disaster..
  
  Us Gods also aren't allowed to fight eachother, our powers colliding can cause catastrophic damage to whatever place we're fighting in and if we happen to kiII eachother, it screws up the entire balance of the multiverse, for example if I died, there would be nobody around that's able to reap in my place, Souls that die in dying timelines or in timelines being erased by Error will be erased and die with it with no chance to be saved, that monster will be permanently gone, their code wiped from existence, reaping them saves them from that fate
  "

   How many rules did you break to be with Geno??
  ","
  Hmn..let's see..
  
  Gods aren't allowed to be with mortals..broke that one
  
  We aren't allowed to change other timelines, broke that one too
  
  I'm not allowed to put others in limbo, that makes 3 rules I've broken..
  
  I'm not allowed to alter someone's fate, which I did with Geno.. so 4 rules?
  
  Each God has their own set of rules they need to follow, if they break those rules depending on how many and how serious the rules that were broken, you can end up executed, exiled or even locked away for eternity, when you get banished or exiled, your stripped away of your powers and never allowed to come back..so it can be pretty serious..
  "
2629,"
   You said you broke several rules when you married Geno, is that why he stayed on the save screen for so long even after you two were together?

  Love, calm down, I wouldn't allow her to do anything like that..she would have to go through me first before she ever laid a hand on you or the kiddos..

  ","
  Thanks Love *Reaper gets to his feet and actually, since he really isn't used to walking he ends up falling right into his Tsundere* Oof!

  Okay, looks like I'm off..maybe keep this between us? I think Geno would freak if he knew I'm heading off somewhere

2822,"
   They are my friends!I trust them!

   I HAVE AN IDEA

  What idea? *Reaper blinks as he stares at Epic*
  "
2825,"
   *This happened before Cross got back* *Dream healed the god so he could be mobile again* Ok you aren't at 100% but you should be able to use normal magic without ill effects. Just don't push it, ok Reaper? *Dream just smiles at the god*

  Thanks Dream *Reaper actually gave him a smile* I'll try to take it easy..  you should get back before Cross panics

  Geez kiddo..this might not be a good idea..I mean..we aren't even in your multiverse..what's gonna stop them from seeing you as lunch here?

2827,"
   Well yeah but its against the  rule to eat your fellow coworkers! They also protect me!
  ","
  But does it count when your off the job?
  "
2828,"
   Like I said they are nice! As long as they eat err...Other things. Jax only eats once a week while Brice eats lots but hes good at not eating around me.

2830,"
   Yeah him and Brice my friend hes a wolf! All three of us work  at food production for humans!

  A wolf and a snake? I'm surprised you made it to work without being eaten..

   Guess you can say dat

2832,"

  ..I could always send them to the Underworld

  Ooh..okay--wait Geno!? *Reaper then pulls his Tsun into a hug* where were you!?
  "
2835,"
   Hey it's okay I still think you're scary!

  Well I'll take that as a compliment, Grim Reaper isn't supposed to be not scary, so uh..you still want me to find your snake pal when I'm better?

   -___- No

  Fake chicken..? Like..what..is it really a rabbit or something?

2838,"
   Oh dat? Dat my rubber chicken bruh

  What?? *Right Reaper is from ancient  times, he has no idea what a rubber chicken is, he thinks it's a literal chicken made of rubber* Chickens in your AU are made of rubber??

   I'm well aware...

   *His skull makes a squeaking noise when it's hit* Lol just kidding bruh

  *Reaper just stares at him and bonks him again cause his head squeaked lol*

  He..does?? I honestly didn't know that ..well it beats having to deal with him..no offense..we just don't get along..

2843,"
   So you're saying I should ask Gaster- *Lol Reaper's gonna force his mouth shut or something XD*
  ","
  NO!! *Reaper actually grabs his scythe and bonks Epic on the skull with the blunt end* i would rather deal with Nightmare than any Gaster!
  "
2844,"
   Uhm Epic has an idea but I'm not sure you'd be ok with it, couldn't the Overwrite fix this
  ","
  To heII with that idea! It would probably work but then I'd have to deal with Cross! *Cross is his husband you know--*
  "
2845,"
   That really doesn't sound good... I'm not sure how much my magic can do about that *Dream is thinking*
  ","
  With just me and my brother it took us years to bring her back..our magic wasn't strong enough..but there's not just 2 people here now and as much as I hate to admit it.. a lot of you do outrank me on power..*Reaper frowned* ..Nova did heal it some, it's not cracked or almost shattering anymore but to fully heal it you can't do it all alone..I couldn't do it alone..if Paps didn't help me Life wouldn't be here at all
  "
2846,"
   He's talking with your kids at the moment, but he's in the house
  ","
  *Reaper sighs* ..I think I might of scared him.. I'll try to explain the situation as best as I can.. the reason I'm hooked up to all this stuff is because my Soul took some serious damage from me constantly using my forbidden powers..it took enough damage from my powers now it doesn't want to accept my magic anymore.. which is a pretty big problem..Epics machines here are forcing it to take magic whether it wants to or not..and Nova completely healed all of my injuries but to heal a Gods Soul is pretty difficult..last time it took both her and Life to fix it.. when a Gods Soul takes damage its not easy to fix it, it took me and my brother forever to bring Life back when Chara kiIIed her
  "
2847,"
   Yes he did, and you were asleep when I got here so...
  ","
  ..*Reaper then rubs his eye sockets* Is he with you?
  "
2848,"
   Hello? Reaper? Geno came by to ask for help healing you, how are you doing... and don't bother lying and saying fine I may not know what is hooked up to you but I do know that stuff is only used when someone is in bad condition
  ","
  Mnh..? *Reaper didn't even notice Geno had left and went to go get Dream, the God thought he was still beside him until he heard Dream speak* ..Dream..? What.. did I fall asleep? ..Geno..got you?
  "
2849,"
   Sorry!
  ","
  I-its fine, really..just don't tell anyone that you saw the Grim Reaper get carried around..*Reaper looked away, he was still a little embarrassed*
  "
2850,"
   Reaper, NOT HELPING
  ","
  M-maybe I should be quiet now.. *Reaper then closes his eye sockets and just nuzzles into Geno, I don't think that's a good idea either--he might think your dead--stahp scaring the smol!*
  "
2851,"
   Reaper, I'm pretty sure you don't want me to have a panic attack right? Well what you're saying, is gonna trigger a panic attack!
  ","
  *Reaper then pulls Geno into a hug* C-calm down Love, I'm not trying to scare you but..you have to admit it's taken a long time, it's like waiting for Death itself *he winks--maybe not a good time to make Death jokes--*
  "
2852,"
   *well I don't think Epic will allow reaper to not survive* I will f-cking kidnap Dream if I have to you ARE recovering.
  ","
  *Reaper sweats a bit* H-hey, I'm fine right now, I'm not on my Death bed anymore just ..things could always go from good to bad in a moments notice, just saying be prepared if that does happen--*That isn't helping*
  "
2853,"
   *I think he grew to like memes AFTER he already had the job. I mean I like memes and still am good at science* Well I'm not going to allow you to dust. If you do I will go to whatever afterlife you end up in and drag you back to the world of the living just to yell at you for leaving me
  ","
  *But imagine a scientist like Epic in real life all dressed up with a lab coat and glasses carrying a clipboard and starts talking like ""BRRRUUUUUUUHHHH IMA FIRIN MAH LAZER AT TEH MOON COWS ARE TURKEYS I LOVE MAH JAB"" then they pull out a rubber chicken from their coat and start slapping people with it--*
  
  Pfft-*Reaper actually laughs from that* it's funny cause I know you would, I don't plan on dusting Love but..I don't think I can hide how bad it is when I look like this..*Reaper holds up his arm and you see a couple blue and red wires taped to it, they were running up his arm into his Soul* ..you know how dangerous it is for me to use my full power right..? And..I've been using it a lot when I really shouldn't have..that's how I ended up like this in the first place, my Soul couldn't handle using all that power back to back.. I'm finally recovering now but..I don't know if I'll make it through recovery.. it's been pretty rough..it's taken literal months for it to start getting better..
  
  *Geno is going to freak--*
  "
2854,"
   our relationship survived because we love each other, and no matter what happens are always there for one another *Geno clinks Reaper's forehead*
  ","
  *Aw**That caused the God to blush bright blue, he didn't expect Geno to clink his forehead and stares up at him in surprise* U-uuuh...I-I mean--that's true..! Kinda surprised you haven't got tired of Death though~
  "
2855,"
   Ok you are staying in bed, not gonna even ask where Epic got all this stuff
  ","
  *Epic is a royal scientist in his AU so that's probably how but--I don't know why they would allow a meme lord like Epic as royal scientist--*
  
  *Reaper just lays his skull down against Genos shoulder* Heh..not that I have much of a choice, I already tried running off with this stuff and ended up put back here..
  
  Though..I could happily dust now knowing your okay..

2856,"
   Yeah I'm fine, you look like you could use some sleep though
  ","
  I'm fine Love, just..really happy your okay *Though that's not true, unfortunately the God seemed to need more help than Geno did, he had a lot of hospital equipment hooked to him, even a monitor was brought in to keep track of his Soul, he looked as bad as CQ Geno and I didn't even think that were possible, he even had a line stuck into his nose hole for oxygen*

  Your asking me of all people for relationship advice? I-I don't even know how ours survived..

   -.- you are lucky my IVs compensate for you wasting magic left and right bruh
  ","
  *Though he probably shouldn't be up when he has a monitor, IVs and who knows what else hooked up, he actually falls over himself and crashes right on top of Epic with the IV toppling down on them, trying to run off with that equipment, not a very big brain idea*

2864,"
   I think so..!

  Kiddo, help me up! *Reaper then holds a hand out to her though not sure how she'll be able to help him, she is pretty small*

   Do you have any cool nicknames?
  ","
  *Reaper looks shocked at that question*.. I don't think I have any nicknames..well, I go by Reaper or Death but..if your the Grim Reaper, do those count as nicknames?
  "
2902,"
   I'm stuck here so yeah.  Like I said before I have no magic being just a rabbit! *takes a bit of cake* So I can't teleport.
  ","
  Do you wanna go back to your world or do you wanna stay in our multiverse? I could probably take you back to your world, I have a scythe I can male portals with
  "
2903,"
   Fine, I'll stay in bed, but if anything happens I'm getting up
  ","
  I can handle it if anything happens, you should stay put *Reaper then grabs onto his scythe and uses it as a makeshift crutch to pull himself up out of bed which really doesn't help Genos nerves*
  "
2904,"
   Are you sure? I mean I can still use some magic, just, really tired...
  ","
  Your in worse shape than I am Love, my wounds will heal, yours won't..
  
  You should stay in bed *Reaper then clinks his skull*
  "
2905,"
   Hopefully they're done being complete asses
  ","
  ..Well, I think one of us should be up in case they don't ..and there's no way in heII I'm letting you out of bed right now.. *Reaper then reaches over the side of their bed and grabs his scythe up off the floor* as long as I don't use any magic I should be fine..
  "
2906,"
   I um kinda discovered these AU things! But yeah I met him first! He asked me to deliver  donuts in exchange  I get monster money!
  ","
  So your kinda stuck here aren't you?
  "
2907,"
   It's kinda like a donut but baked  and  with more frosting!*offers him a slice cautiously she scared to get close to him*
  ","
  *Well if he touched her she be dead xD she has a reason to worry*
  
  Thanks kiddo..though as much as I'd like to try it, I think I know someone who could use it more than I do *he then hands the slice of cake to

  "
2908,"
   You're worried about people bothering us still?
  ","
  Kinda..we did just have anons attack us..*Reaper sighs* ..
  "
2909,"
   This isn't up for discussion is it
  ","
  No it's not *Reaper frowned* just..don't know what to do now since neither of us are really up for moving around..
  
  *he tries to think*...
  "
2910,"
   hmn? *Geno half wakes up* what you say?
  ","
  *Reaper shakes his skull* I-its nothing..just..you were worried about me the whole time when your not okay.. you stay put, you hear me?
  "
2911,"
   *When Reaper next wakes Geno is shaking and his bones feel ice cold, seems the stress got to him*
  ","
  Love?? *Reaper then sits himself up and takes off his half of their blanket and wraps it around Geno* W-what happened..!? Did you get sick??
  "
2912,"
   Thanks mr reaper! *shes  pretty short being 3'9 since shes standing on two legs* Yeah me and my friends are pretty nice! So is Jax hes a snake. *she smile taking a peice of carrot cake out* Oh um do you want some?Its pretty good!I lts nice to eat something besides salads  and food pellets.
  ","
  *SheSoCute* Uh..not really used to anyone thanking Death of all people but..your welcome? And I still think there should be someone that should stick up for you guys..even in my timeline I was the only one who stood up to Chara and saw the kiddo for what she really was..
  
  ..Did you say carrot cake? What's a cake? *Right he's from ancient time--wait he's had donuts but never had a cake!?*
  "
2913,"
   *because Nova's half human she wouldn't be able to understand Jasper when she speaks*
  ","
  *But she's also half harbinger, maybe she could make out some words but maybe not enough to fully understand her, like Papyrus when he tries to figure out windings and considering Sans can understand Moldsmal that literally just wiggles around and doesn't speak, I think monsters could understand Jasper*
  "
2914,"
   Its just how things we arent humans so we are food. I try to stay  optimistic! I have to I'm a rabbit life isnt easy for us.. Oh um..Do mind you if I eat here? I have carrot cake with me. I havent eaten all day.
  ","
  I think you guys should do something to level the playing field, it shouldn't be that way *Reaper frowned* ..and you can eat here, you did bring us donuts..plus you don't seem like a bad kiddo
  "
2915,"
   Well um... Humans can't understand us animals like they just hear noises when we speak and  they have access to weapons we cant use.. So humans rule and we adapted to suit their needs.. It's just how things work. I dont like it but i was born  into that world.
  ","
  That doesn't sound exactly peaceful like you said.. they eat you and attack you just because they can't understand you? *Reaper frowned* yet you guys haven't done anything to them.. I don't know about you but a animal that can talk shouldn't be considered food
  "
2916,"
   It's a long story but yeah! I live on a version of earth where all animals are sentient like me  humans eat animals and predators eat prey  but it's just the natural order! Humans are the superior  species though! Being the smartest...
  ","
  *Reaper pauses when he hears that* I don't think I'd agree with you on that kiddo..
  "
2917,"
   *Geno gets back later with a large box of donuts, about half are for Reaper the other half are for the kids*
  ","
  *When Geno returns Reaper was seen still laying in the same spot he were left in but only with Shino sitting on the end of the bed, he hasn't moved at all*
  "
2918,"
   Daddy..? *Shino just tilts her skull, she's honestly confused, with her age she doesn't understand much but she can tell her dad wasn't okay* You look like Raven when he comes back home with Blueprint..but don't worry! The Great Shino is here to watch you!
  ","
  *Shino is a very inoccent smol**Reaper doesn't move from the spot he were laying in, no matter how much Shino talked to him, she couldn't get a response out of him*
  "
2919,"
   Daddy! Are you okay? *Shino teleports on top of the bed though she knows not to touch her dad since he doesn't like it, she doesn't know the reasoning behind it though* Mummy went out and I was asked to watch you! He's gonna bring back donuts for everyone! I hope you get better!
  ","
  *Reaper doesn't even seem to notice Shino was there, he was completely out cold, though he might scare their poor daughter without meaning to, he had a green blush going across his skull and his breath sounded raspy and wheezy, he really needs to quit using his magic and let his Soul recover*..
  "
2920,"
   *Geno all but pushes Reaper back into bed, if he had a pulse it'd be racing*
  ","
  *Reaper doesn't even seem to notice he was put back in bed, honestly he may have passed out right then and there on poor Geno, if only he knew how much he was really scaring him*
  "
2921,"
   No you're just gonna stay in bed, if the situation was reversed you'd probably be tying me down in bed right now
  ","
  ..*Reaper chuckled a bit since that is true, he has handcuffed Geno, tied him up and even went as far as putting a magic suppressor on him to make sure he was resting when he needed it*
  
  ...B-but..your in a different boat..Love.. you only have a ninth of..a Soul..I'm still in better shape..than you are.. a-actually..right now..it should be rever..*he trails off as he was starting to black out a bit*..
  "
2922,"
   *Geno hugs him* that's ok, I'll send another text to the kids saying we changed plans. How about you get some more rest and I'll get more donuts?
  ","
  *Reaper just rests in Genos arms with his eyes closed, he seemed exhausted* ...we..can still..go out..if..*huff* we had way..for me to travel..w-without walking..*wheeze* so..tired..
  "
2923,"
   *Geno walks over to Reaper, he's worried about him*
  ","
  *Reaper then flops against Genos leg when his Tsun walked up beside him* ..I..I don't think..I can..do it... ..
  "
2924,"
   Are you sure you're up for a trip to the surface?
  ","
  ..G-Geno..*Reaper just waves a arm motioning for Geno to come over to him, is he okay?*
  "
2925,"
   No you made it to our doorway....
  ","
  ..You k-kidding..me..? *Reaper then slides down on his knees with a arm wrapped around the IV stand as he takes a moment to catch his breath* ..so..tired..
  "
2926,"
   *Geno keeps an eye on Reaper just in case he isn't able to stand on his own*
  ","
  *Reaper is having quite a bit of trouble, he's holding onto his IV stand so he doesn't fall and tries taking baby steps to walk, it was honestly painful to watch since it took him literally 20 minutes to hobble from their bed to their doorway, by the end of it, the God was gasping and clinging to the IV stand*....D-did..I get..to the ...kitchen..?
  "
2927,"
   *Geno sent all their kids a text... I think he forgot he has Goth's phone though*
  ","
  *Goth is busy tormenting a robot anyway xD*
  "
2928,"
   *Geno stands up and helps Reaper to his 'feet'* You good?
  ","
  *Reaper had started breathing heavily and gripped at his chest once he was helped up* ..I-I think.. let me..t-try.. ..
  "
2929,"
   Fine I'll send them all a text
  ","
  Thanks Love..*Reaper is trying his best to calm himself, at least enough that he isn't having a literal Death Grip on Geno* ..You think you can help me up..?
  "
2930,"
   Do you want me to go grab them?
  ","
  Or..we could text them..I..I really need you here right now *Reaper then clings onto Geno, he still seemed pretty shaken up*
  
  I know it's selfish of me but..I really need you right now..please stay..
  "
2931,"
   You won't collapse on me right? I mean I kinda wanna get away for a bit too, maybe we should have stayed in Nova's world...
  ","
  After what Raven did? ..*Reaper shakes his skull* why don't we just spend some time on the surface? Like we used to..we can bring the kiddos along if you want..and..I can let you know if it's too much on me so we can rest somewhere.. I know you've been worried to Death..
  "
2932,"
   That doesn't mean you need to look it
  ","
  Heh..*Reaper wipes his eye sockets* W-we haven't been back long..and I already wanna leave for vacation..can we go out on a date..? Or s-something? I know I'm not well but..there's ways to get around it..I used to c-carry you around in a wheelchair when you got too tired to walk..*
  "
2933,"
   Hey cheer up, no need to look so grim
  ","
  ..H-heh..*That managed to get a slight chuckle out of him* ..b-but..my name is Grim..
  "
2934,"
   *Geno just hugs him* No you didn't, the only time I ever tried that it was Life's fault. That time she let you dust...
  ","
  *Reaper just keeps his skull buried into Genos chest, he can't manage to get himself to stop crying, he was so choked up with tears when he tried to speak he ended up blubbering and coughing* ..
  "
2935,"
   I wanted to see what it would take to trigger you and Geno and now my mission is complete
  ","
  ..*The mod YEETS you out of here, I hope you feel proud of yourselves, you didn't just trigger them, Reaper might be actually broken now, he's had so much guilt over the Hatred taking control of him..it hurts him each time it's brought up*
  "
2936,"
   No, I'm not upset over what happened when you had the Hatred, I saw first hand how much you struggled to keep control. *Geno just sighs and pets Reaper's skull*

2937,"
   Kinda!
  ","
  So you got sent to Ccinos AU?
  "
2938,"
   *Geno gets Reaper home and switches out his old IV lines for fresh ones* I don't know what they said, but it doesn't matter, we're still here, still together so they can all go rot

  *Reaper seemed relieved when they were back home and just lays against Geno after his IVs were changed*
  
  ..That's true..just..*he then hugged his Tsun tightly* Love I..y-you don't..are..are you still upset over..what I did..when I had Hatred? ..I-I really had no control over what I did...I saw what I was doing but..I couldn't stop it..I couldn't get myself under control..

   What gossip about yourself has made you laugh?

   @DontcallmeSans
  
  not really gossip but..

  Geno..*Reaper was about to start crying all over again* I really love you..

  ","
  ..*Reaper then looked away from Geno, he seemed to be trembling just from the question* ..I-I can't tell you..I just can't...
  "
2942,"
   Didn't you cause Geno to hang himself when you had Hatred?
  ","
  *Reaper then hurls his scythe at you, dusting you on the spot before teleporting away which he really shouldn't be doing right now but boy did that hurt being reminded of that, you don't have full control of yourself when you get infected with Hatred though, most of his actions were done against his will*
  "
2943,"
   I'm uhhh not from a AU i kinda just exist in a universe with humans and sentient animals living together in peace mostly..  Uh yeah I do! it's kinda cold now though. *gives him it* Sorry...!!
  ","
  You live in a whole different universe in space? How did you meet Ccino? You get sent here by accident?
  
  *Reaper takes the coffee* It's okay kiddo, thanks for the coffee
  "
2944,"
   Well they asked me if I've ever self 'armed so it's not just you they're being jerks to
  ","
  W-where's my scythe? *Reaper pushes himself up so that he's in a sitting position and looks around their bed* I dropped it somewhere..
  "
2945,"
   Who cares why they brought it up, that's in the past, don't dwell on it *Geno suspects the reason the anon brought it up was to compare Reaper to Ganz who keeps Sensy drugged and is just shutting this topic down*
  ","
  Thanks Love..*Reaper tries to smile but his smile starts to falter when tears began escaping his eyes* N-not exactly how I planned the day to start off..

2946,"
   When you had Hatred didn't you keep Geno drugged so he wouldn't leave you?
  ","
  *Reaper had just opened his eye sockets and he hears this*

  "
2947,"
   *sighs* That's better. *calms down* That's a good thing I rather NOT see you do what youre suppose to do... Is there anything i can  get you scary skeleton dude?

  You might wanna stay out of harms way then, Jasper right? *Reaper then pulls out part of a scroll from his robe* What AU are you from? And..well, did you happen to bring any coffee with you by chance?
  "
2948,"
   I just  dont like the pointy thing youre holding...! It triggers a instinctual FEAR.... Everything feels off about you in general like youre not normal even for a monster..

  Told you I'm the literal Grim Reaper kiddo, you just happened to see me on my day off..*Reaper then sets his scythe on the floor beside the bed he's sitting in*

    @onryotatarigami
   
   for the advanced warning about
   
    @GanzGZTale
   
   earlier. The idiot said in front of her he was planning on going after Geno

  I really hate that guy..but when I can, I'll have to thank her, I didn't know she gave a warning about him..guessing that's why Geno acted the way he did..he still needs to explain how he knows how to use that gun thing *Reaper then yawns*
  "
2950,"
   Eeep! *jumps scared lol* Do you even reap animals?
  ","
  We reap anyone who's on the list kiddo, animals included *Reaper just chuckles* What's wrong? Death got your tombstone? You look like you've seen a ghost~
  "
2951,"
   And you're creepier than the other skeleton I met! I'll be sure to tell him!  Hehe! *sets the box next to him*
  ","
  I'll take that as a compliment, Death is supposed to look scary *Reaper then holds up his scythe* your pretty lucky your not on my list
  "
2952,"
   Apparently that cafe sans you kidnapped when you were an error sent the bunny over
  ","
  Yeeaaah..there's still a few apologies I need to make..*Reaper gave a nervous grin* ...
  "
2953,"
   Some monster name Ccino! I'm Jasper! I'm not a monster just a talking bunny. I dont have magic like you guys do!  This place is kinda scary...! *shivers*
  ","
  I didn't think he'd send us donuts..can you tell him thanks for me?
  
  And well, this is where all the Souls of the dead go, it's not going to look pretty *Reaper chuckled a bit*
  "
2954,"
   Oh this is where he sent me...?! OH well! I'm just here to give you these! *jasper  hops off to give reaper the box *
  ","
  Huh? *Reaper looks at the bunny and at the box they were carrying* Who sent you here? I don't know if you know this but..this place is called ReaperTale, it's where all the Souls of those who die end up, I'm the literal Grim Reaper who takes those Souls..
  "
2955,"
   *delivering donuts  to you* Hello  anyone home?
  ","
  Huh? *Reaper looks over at the bunny that just walked in* You know..not many people are brave enough to walk in Deaths house..

2956,"
   To be fair you can act cute when I'm there. Just most people don't see that

  Uuuhhhhhh....*Reaper.exe has crashed* B-but your the cute one..! How is literal Death cute!? I'm terrifying..! That anon needs glasses!

2958,"
   You really are a cinnamon roll aren't you?
  ","
  Uuuhhh...what? *Reaper is shocked he was called a cinnamon roll*
  "
2959,"
   how long does it take for metal to break with your death touch?
  ","
  ..That depends..if your talking about if I just held onto a piece of metal and never let go of it, it would take maybe 3 or 4 days for it to rust and break..*Reaper then suddenly started coughing*.. I-I think..*cough* that's all I can answer..f-for now..not doing the best kiddo..

2960,"
   ... who the hell could be knocking on the door *Geno goes to check*

  I have no idea..if you need me, I'm right here Love, just be careful..

2962,"
   stop being silly, just a mystery story is all, I figure it's probably better if I stay here to keep an eye on you

  *Reaper then lays his skull against Genos shoulder* We do have time to be silly now and I'm taking it~ Don't mind taking the chance to cuddle eithe-*he pauses when he hears a knock at their door* ..I don't think I can get that..
  "
2963,"
   how quickly do things age, like could a being with a really long lifespan touch you for a moment
  ","
  I..haven't thought about that..I know that anything made of metal takes longer to age and fall apart than anything else I've interacted with..my Death touch usually dusts anyone I come in contact with within seconds..
  "
2964,"
   *Geno is seated nearby paging through a book*
  ","
  *Reaper tries to peak over at Genos book* What ya reading three Love? How to make love maybe?~
  "
2965,"
   how come your scythe doesnt fall apart?
  ","
  It's made out of a special type of metal that's both strong and doesn't age, we call it Death metal, pun intended~ *Reaper chuckled*
  "
2966,"
   what if the doctors wore gloves?
  ","
  Their gloves are made of plastic, plastic is something that can age and fall apart..
  "
2967,"
   Is there anything thats immune to your death touch?
  ","
  Besides anyone that's immortal? Not really..how my Death touch works is it causes things to age rapidly and fall apart..that's why it doesn't affect clothing, it's not something that can age.. it can't affect the Gods here or Geno since they don't age..
  "
2968,"
   I think geno should take you to a hospital you dont look ok at all
  ","
  ..I'm literal Death of course I wouldn't look okay *Reaper chuckled a bit* jokes aside..not only would that give Geno a panic attack..but my Death touch nearly kills everyone there..it's just a bad idea..

2969,"
   Don't get out of bed, you are on 2 IVs, Nova might have stopped your soul from shattering but you clearly still need to recover
  ","
  ..Huh..? *Reaper then looks to see he does in fact have 2 IVs in his Soul now* ..Heh..you really did catch me..not in the way I hoped though.. But..you shouldn't push yourself either Love.. you can't exactly deal with stress very well ..*he gives a faint smile* the only thing you should worry about is our next date
  "
2970,"
   *he does catch Reaper, and gets the god in bed quickly hooking him up to another IV*

   *Geno turns to Reaper after Ganz is dust* are you gonna be ok?
  ","
  ..Y-yeah..but.. c-can you..catch me..? *Reaper then collapses, dropping his scythe from his hands*
  "
2972,"
   Gz: Would you trade Geno to me if I gave you a doughnut? *Ganz steps in the doorway* not hard to get here when you have a ghost following you
Mel: Not actually a ghost but it's easier to explain it that way
  ","
  ..*Reaper was honestly shocked, he didn't expect to see Ganz show up and immediately summons his scythe* I think I know why Geno was acting that way now.. *he stumbles quite a bit but forces himself up out of bed with his scythe acting as his crutch* I'm going to send you personally to heII...
  "
2973,"
   Do you like ketchup?
  ","
  ..*Reaper was just starting to wake up when he hears this, he was seen rubbing his eye sockets* ..Ketchup..? I know that's one of Genos favorites but..personally, I've never had it so..can't really tell you.. my favorite thing is coffee, the ones from Starbucks are so good..with donuts..*you actually see him drool with the goofiest grin on his face* what I would give for a donut right now..

2974,"
   pfft just get some rest, ok?

  Your always worried~ *Reaper chuckled a bit* But..it is normal to worry about someone you love..I worry about you everyday *he opens his eye a tad so he can give Geno a smile* maybe that's why your always tired, you do run through my mind all day~

   Well I already took his phone from him, so he's pretty bent out of shape about that... you're gonna be ok right?
  ","
  That's good..but I say..we ground him from seeing Palette period..that'll teach him not to do pranks like this.. and.. If..I'm being honest here.. ..I..I really don't know Love..it's never been this bad before.. *Reaper then grips at his chest* if I stop using my powers for a while..it might--it should be fine.. how are you holding up though?

2977,"
   Still if we're in bed he shouldn't be pranking us to begin with
  ","
  *Reaper closes his eyes* True.. he shouldn't be pranking you anyway with your Soul as is.. the first thing I'm doing is grounding him for a month..when I can move again..

2978,"
   I am, I think we've been back maybe a full day and already Goth has managed to get into a lot of trouble
  ","
  ..Heh..I know h-he's a prankster but..he really needs to learn that some of his pranks aren't exactly safe..at least all he did t-this time  was spray people with water..the last prank he did blew me away..literally..

2979,"
   Yeah sure *Geno does lie down, he seems tired, but after that scare can you blame him*

3001,"

   Geno placed you there, look if your soul is having trouble you shouldn't push things

  It's b-been how long though..? It should of recovered.. *Reaper then winces as he tries to push himself up into a sitting position but ends up laying right back down, going into a complete coughing fit*

   Good to know *yeah I had another anon fail*

  Uh...I'm guessing it really was you I told that to..wasn't it? ..I-its not as bad as I made it sound like! *Reaper is trying to back peddle* I-I mean--I didn't expect it to be you..!

3009,"
   Are you ready to return home?
  ","
  Huh? Y-yeah but..*Reaper then grips at his Soul* I don't know if I can..usually I'd be in perfect condition by now..it normally only takes a maximum of 3 days for me to fully recover from any injury and we've been here far longer than that..but.. my Soul..it's been really acting up and it hasn't recovered at all like it was supposed to..it should be healed by now but..I'm still walking around completely drained of magic..just whatever you do..don't tell Geno about any of this..he has enough on his plate to deal with..plus his condition is far worse than mine..just..I don't know what to do here..you can't protect your family if you can't even walk..

3072,"
   You could teach him, he's a lot more likely to listen to you than Life
  ","
  That was before me and Life became enemies though..she never forgave me for what happened to Chara..I was hoping we could of at least stayed friends..as you know I don't have very many..*Reaper sighed* a-anyway, I can see about trying to teach Asgore about cellphones..
  
  Doubt he'll understand it though..me and Painless messed around with them for a while before we got the hang of it
  "
3073,"
   guessing Geno taught you how to use most of the things in your house
  ","
  Pretty much..*Reaper looks a bit embarrassed now* I didn't even know the names of the stuff I'd taken..I called cellphones a magic box you can use to talk to eachother.. I didn't know what stores were either, here we call them agora and it's not the same type of store Geno is thinking of, our stores don't use coins, you just take what you need and be on your way..
  
  *His timeline is very ancient*
  "
3074,"
   Does Asgore have a phone? Maybe you could give him one, so that way if you need his help, you can just call or text him like you do Geno :0
  ","
  I tried that with Life but she couldn't figure out how to use it..*Reaper frowned* even though I personally tried to show her how..I don't know if Asgore will be able to learn how either.. our timeline isn't like the others, we send hand written letters to eachother using birds..I learned about cellphones from stealing the one I have off a body I reaped..
  "
3075,"
   Depends on how it manifests, in my case and my dad's it is telepethy and a form of aura sensing, for Opal it's seeing ghosts and being able to talk with them
  ","
  We'll keep talking later, I need to go get Gothy and see Life before I forget again..*Reaper then holds his Soul* you would think with all the peace and quiet for once that everything would be fine now..
  "
3076,"
   *Geno might have dozed off while Reaper was hugging him... is cute*
  ","
  *They are cute cX*
  "
3077,"
   We're not sure, we suspect she has some non human in her ancestry although a 6th sense isn't completely unheard of among humans, I mean my dad has a mild 6th sense that my hybridization strengthened greatly
  ","
  But a 6th sense doesn't mean you would be able to communicate with the dead like that..does it?
  "
3078,"
   I was taking shelter there, I tried to stay places humans wouldn't find me so the Facility wouldn't be able to track me down. Must be funny for you seeing how confidant I am now to think of me cowering in hiding from humans. And yeah Opal talks to ghosts
  ","
  I dunno about funny but you definitely don't sound like the same Nova, the one we know now wouldn't hide or cower in fear of anyone, heII, you took me on and Nightmare himself without batting a eye! I can understand why you would be afraid of humans though after what you've gone through but..that doesn't sound like the Nova I met here..
  
  I wonder though..if Opal can communicate with the dead just like I can..is she entirely human?
  "
3079,"
   You know how Nova and Opal met? Opal is a medium who helps ghosts move  on to the other side, Nova hid in the attic of a haunted house that she had been hired to cleanse. Opal found her cowering in the attic
  ","
  I didn't know that either..so Opal talks to ghosts? Like divination? Or exorcist? *Riigght Reapers from ancient times, he doesn't know about mediums*
  
  Why was Nova hiding in a attic..?
  "
3080,"
   Well based off the fact Nova seemed to know something was going on I'm guessing there was actually someone else in your mind as opposed to it just being voices. Was it
   
    @BowsOfLights
   
   ? He's the only other telepath I know of
  ","
  Well..not exactly..it's someone who did experiments on Nova..*Geno going to freak out in 3 minutes*
  
  Though from what I heard he was forced to do it against his will, the scientists there can kiII him if he refuses to do what they say
  "
3081,"
   **I volunteered for Project Evolution, I was a simple scientist before then. Though I did not know the truth of the organization I worked for, if I had I would never have offered to be their test subject**
  ","
  ""So..wait..you were one of those humans but..you didn't know what they were doing..and they turned on you..am I understanding this right? I know I have trouble understanding these things since..how do I explain? The world I'm from has beds made of stone and we use water clocks to tell time, if that tells you anything...project evolution?""
  "
3082,"
   I only ever saw cybernetics in Alphys' anime, it's when you have a regular human with robotic enhancements, a complex, well that word has a few definitions but based off the context I heard from Nova it's basically a place built to survive the end of the world and keep the people inside alive
  ","
  Oh..*Reaper rubs his skull, looking a bit embarrassed* Anime doesn't even exist in ReaperTale.. I only learned it from you when you got Gothy that mew mew book and that moving picture thing for his birthday, you call them DVDs and shows, you also were the one that taught me how to use the TV I had and told me the stuff on there were called shows and movies..
  
  ..and.. If that's what a complex is, maybe we should move into one *he chuckled a bit*
  "
3083,"
   *right now Geno is just very confused*
  ","
  *Reaper is just kinda standing there lost in his own thoughts lol**He does finally speak outloud after a bit* Uh...Love? Can you explain what cybernetics are and what a complex is?
  "
3084,"
   **hmn how to put this in a way you might understand... the experiments they did on me to give me the abilities I have also gave them complete control of my life, they choose if I am active or dormant**
  ","
  ""So those humans pretty much control your every move, all the more reason why a place like that should be taken down, where I'm from they don't exactly have scientists at least not the same kind and I thinks it's about time yours got their karma..wait you said they gave you your powers?""
  "
3085,"
   **Considering they can turn off the Neural cybernetic mesh that is integrated into my brain and thus render me comatose until they decide to reactivate my cybernetics saying I was forced to do what I did is not much of a stretch**
  ","
  ""Cyber--wha?? Now you lost me..all I understood was the comatose part..""
  
  *Geno would probably be facepalming if he could hear their conversation*
  "
3086,"
   They managed to hold Nova captive for years, we have no idea what they're capable of
  ","
  That's true..but they also haven't had to deal with the Grim Reaper face to face..*Reaper just smiles* I'll be okay Love, don't forget I'm called the God of Death for a reason
  "
3087,"
   ... Lyon and I... it's hard to explain, I mean he was in charge of the experiments run on me, but he also kept the full scope of my abilities at the time back then secret which was how I could escape
  ","
  ..But you called him a subject just like what those humans called you..it sounds like he might of been forced to do things just like you were..I don't see why else he would help you escape...
  "
3088,"
   Reaper I understand wanting to help Nova after everything she's done, but PLEASE do not go picking a fight with a giant organization from outside our Multiverse, we have enough to deal with here
  ","
  Love, I know your worried but I don't think any normal human could stop me, even if it's a whole army, I'm literal Death, one touch and they all would die plus they're outside the multiverse, it's not like they can rally up more humans and come here
  
  *Though if they have guns, sentries, turrets, etc all modern tech Reaper has never had to fight against..it could go south, Reaper is from ancient times where organizations like that never existed, Geno has a lot to be worried about, this is the same skeleton that attacked a whole amusement park thinking the roller coasters were out to eat his family*
  "
3089,"
   Lyon is Subject One, and like me he's immune to Death [[I could bring back Lyon's account for a little while actually, he's a more skilled telepath than Nova is so he could probably reach Reaper just tracing the mental wavelengths Nova's communicated with
  ","
  That's good to know, so if I use my Death to take everyone out, I'll find him, he'll be the only one immune to it..I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he's a friend of yours?
  
  *But considering Nova is just as powerful as Reaper and was taken down by them..I wonder if the scientists would stand a chance against Reaper or be able to capture him, though unlike Nova, Reaper has a death touch and a lethal aura he can unleash, I don't think they could get near him unless they manage to wear him down*
  
  *It would be cool to see Lyon though, he's even more of a mystery than Nova :0 I don't know much about him*
  "
3090,"
   I doubt they even know, only the top operatives knew anything the rest just followed orders. Maybe Lyon would know where the other complexes are but considering he's a heavily guarded asset I'm not sure it'd be possible to reach him anyway
  ","
  You forget I'm literal Death, every universe has a version of Death out there even if they aren't seen, they're there..they won't be able to stop me if I decide to destroy their building and reap their Souls, I guarantee I can find whoever that Lion guy is easily and find the other complexes..
  "
3091,"
   I could take you there, but I have no idea how big the organization really is, I was housed in the North American complex that had hundreds of scientists and mercenaries working there at any given time but I heard about a European and Asian complex, and I don't even know where any of them are....
  ","
  For as much as you've done for us, I wanna return the favor somehow and getting even with those scientists sounds like a good way to do it, I'll try to get them to tell me where the other..complex? *Reaper pauses since he doesn't know what a complex is*
  "
3092,"
   Sorell and Shino are doing ok, guess we're lucky that they're content just to play together.... I haven't heard from Goth at all
  ","
  Well I can stop by and grab Gothy while I'm out, knowing him he's probably been busy with Palette
  "
3093,"
   Yeah she can
  ","
  Then it's settled, I'll be back soon Love~ *Reaper then clinks his cheek*
  "
3094,"
   *Geno chuckles slightly at that* probably, Nova said she might be able to revive them but she's already done so much, if we could get word to Life somehow
  ","
  ..Nova can let me back in if I head out of here, right? *The Death God turned to smile at Geno* I can send word to Life and grab our kiddos once they're back
  "
3095,"
   Just thinking about Raven and Silver... they dusted almost a month ago and we never had a chance to revive them
  ","
  ..*Reaper then gently pulls Geno to him* We'll get them back Love..I promise..they won't stay gone.. they'll probably be mad we took so long to revive them though..*he chuckled a bit in a attempt to lighten the mood*
  "
3096,"
   Hmn? *he looks over at Reaper, he seems upset... what was he thinking about as he stared outside*
  ","
  *Reaper gets himself up to his ""feet"" and heads over beside him* What's the matter Love..?

3097,"
   *When Reaper wakes up he's not in Geno's lap anymore, the glitch was standing near a set of windows looking outside*

3101,"
   Yeah well mine's kinda stuck like that

  True but still..I still worry about you Love.. *Reaper then lays himself down on Genos lap, wincing a bit* mngh..

  *Reaper just smiles at his Tsundere* Kinda ironic your worried about my skull when yours is the one that's melted..
  "
3103,"
   I think you meant if they're dead in the Alpha timeline, I mean humans don't live that long. Also You saw me on the save screen back before Frisk ended up trapped there too. Back when I was completely alone
  ","
  I always get those mixed up..and that's true.. now that I think of it..maybe that's why I never saw your Frisk.. it's not that they avoided me, maybe they weren't there yet..that means when I had to take off to face Chara..it took way longer than I thought it did..*Reaper rubs his skull*.. ow..
  "
3104,"
   They stopped resetting after finishing the true pacifist run where they also got me off the save screen....
  ","
  Huh..well if your Frisk is still alive in the Classic timeline then you'll know if they truly stopped using the Reset like they promised..
  "
3105,"
   Wait have we really known each other that long?? I guess that means my Frisk would have died of old age by now.... such a strange thought
  ","
  Well, I did first meet you back when you were still on the Save screen with your Frisk though your Frisk stayed out of sight whenever I visited..I had to stop my visits for a while though when Chara went ahead and killed Life and my scythe got stolen..
  
  And I dunno about that..if your Frisk still has the power to Reset, Load and Save, they can probably avoid that..
  "
3106,"
   I could say the same to you, you were out cold for awhile after that head injury...
  ","
  You shouldn't worry too much about that, I don't have much up there to hurt *Reaper winks and lightly hits his own skull though he winces a bit afterwards* ..Maybe I shouldn't joke like that.. ow..
  "
3107,"
   That's... I'm not sure, I mean now I have people who I can talk to and who are fine with me being what I am but it's still such a novel thing to me, I mean I haven't even been free a decade yet
  ","
  Heh..I'll take that as a no then, I've known Geno for hundreds of years now but.. I'm still not used to it.. he still surprises me..even in ReaperTale I know I had a few people nice towards me but..the majority wasn't .. I didn't go through the same exact things you did but..I do understand what it must be like..
  "
3108,"
   Well glad to see you're getting along *Geno woke up at some point*
  ","
  Huh? Oh, Morning Love, glad to see your awake *Reaper looks over his shoulder at Geno and gave a faint smile*

  ","
  ..Do you ever get used to it? *Reaper looks back up at her*
  "
3110,"
   Considering Ive proven to your Gaster that I can take him, I doubt he'd want to fight again any time soon. Oh I grabbed some extra clothes for all of you when Geno asked me to pick up some more IVs

  *Reaper then stares down at the floor* .. I-I honestly don't know how to thank you..it's not often anyone is nice to me..usually the only person who is, is Geno and he still shocks me with how much he cares..
  
  It's like I'm living in a completely different world..
  
  ..I bet you felt the same after all you've been through..

3111,"
   Not like he can do anything about it, we're outside the underverse, you guys are the only ones who have seen it

  True but I'm more concerned about anons spilling the beans ..they always go out of their way to make things worse..

3112,"
   Yup, I grabbed a shard when I shattered it

  Is there a way I can get to the human Universe and reap those guys?
  "
3138,"
   Yeah my dad calls me Lexi, he's still alive but I have to stay away from him for his own safety. If the people who experimented on me found out about him I have no doubt in my mind they would threaten him to reach me

  I could call myself Bob tomorrow and everyone will still know I'm the Grim Reaper *he chuckled a bit* just depends what you wanna go with

   *Geno's in the doorway, he looks exhausted* Life was over a few times, but I was too busy keeping an eye on your condition most of the time for company, Life would come by to make sure I was remembering to eat... The kids are still with friends but I think they're all pretty worried at this point...
  ","
  ..G-Geno..*Reaper actually starts tearing up, he felt horrible that Geno and their kiddos all suffered because of his condition, they both know when their kids come home they're all going to freak but Reaper really couldn't help it, he took a lot and I mean a lot of damage from everything* ..
  "
3410,"
   Reaper it's been a month... I've mostly been living in silence, I have had to be here almost 24/7 to keep an eye on you
  ","
  W-what..!? *Reaper then looks around, scanning the room to see exactly where Geno was* Geno..! W-why would--you could of had company or--I don't want you miserable Love..!
  "
3411,"
   I just haven't spoken much lately.... you have no idea how long you've been unconscious do you
  ","
  *Reaper shakes his skull no* Why..? Was..it long? Sorry I fell asleep on you..but..you shouldn't stop talking cause I was out.. besides..I love hearing your voice
  "
3412,"
   Reaper? *his voice cracks as if it hasn't been used in awhile*
  ","
  *Reaper slowly opened his eye sockets when he heard Geno say his name though he noticed his Tsundere didn't quite sound the same* ..Love..? You...okay..?
  "
3413,"
   *Geno checks in with Reaper every hour*
  ","
  *During one of the check ins, he hears a familiar voice call his name*
  
  ...Geno...?
  "
3414,"
   *it was one hellish month for Geno, he carefully tended to Reaper's medical needs, even asking Life for advice at times. He tried staying in contact with his kids as best his can, but they can probably tell their mom is not doing well*
  ","
  *Oof**The only good news is after one grueling month went by, the God had finally shown signs of waking up while Geno was tending to his wounds, his body had done a slight stretch with his closed eye sockets twitching a bit* gngh...

   Where your passion lies?

   @DontcallmeSans
  
"
3416,"
   I think the whole multiverse knows about our issues
  ","
  ..I think that anon was right about us being a laughing stock..even when I became a Error I don't think it earned us any respect.. ..
  "
3417,"
   And I’m not letting you go anywhere either
  ","
  You really are a worry wart, kinda explains this too *Reaper motions to his hand that's cuffed to the bed* you know...this would be something we could do for ""fun""~
  "
3418,"
   Yup the doctor! I'm his assistant!^^
  ","
  *Reaper looks back at
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  for a moment* Did..Geno call you? Or...did someone else tell you about our situation..?
  "
3419,"
   I'd have worried myself to death several times over
  ","
  Well, it's not all bad, you'd still end up with me either way *Reaper then lays his skull against Genos hand* you know it's kinda ironic..you give life to Death.. I wouldn't be here right now if it weren't for you Love
  "
3420,"
   That's worrisome...
  ","
  Your just a worry wart..*Reaper gave a faint smile, he was trying to joke with Geno since he can tell his Tsun is super stressed and worried for the God* If you weren't in limbo you would of worried yourself to Death..
  "
3421,"
   I'm a version of allura actually...
  ","
  ..That explains..but your a version of her that works for Anti?
  "
3422,"
   Any other anons have sh!t to say they can say it to me
  ","
  *Reaper just nuzzles his skull against Genos hand* They'll be dealing with both of us~
  "
3423,"
   Reaper is your sight ok? She's a skeleton....
  ","
  She's a skeleton? *Reaper rubs his eye sockets*..I can't tell..but I did think Cross was you earlier..
  "
3424,"
   I think it must be an AU version of her....
  ","
  Like HumanTale? That AU is pretty different..*Reaper frowned*
  "
3425,"
   Oh um hey! Mr.Reaper, Doctor Anti sent me check up on you! How have you been feeling? *smiles*
  ","
  ...What? *Reaper just stares in shock for a few minutes, he was honestly expecting Allura not a human who..is a doctor? And they work with Anti?*
  
  Uh..Geno..? What--how do I--what?
  
  *he doesn't know exactly how to respond and looks back at
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  *
  
  She isn't Allura..I thought..I'm really confused..
  "
3426,"
   You've told me this *Geno chuckles*
  ","
  Well that's cause it's true~ I love seeing my angel show his dark side~ Maybe it's cause I'm a sadist like he said~ *Reaper chuckled weakly*
  "
3427,"
   *she knocks on the door frame since the  door is busted * Anyone home?*she sounds almost like allura*
  ","
  *Reaper confuses the new voice for Alluras and allows the stranger inside*
  
  The doors open, literally, you can come in
  "
3428,"
   Well these f-ckers are pissing me off, don't they have anything better to do
  ","
  *Reaper just smiles* You know..you look really hot when your mad~
  "
3429,"
   Did... did my healing not help you any?
  ","
  Your the one who healed me? *Reaper then turns to look up at Dream* thanks..you did help a lot..I'm just really tired.. and your husband charging in here didn't help..
  "
3430,"
   *Geno just reduces the anon to less than dust with several blasters*
  ","
  *Reaper gently pulls on Genos hoodie to try and pull him down in bed beside him* Geno..don't overdo it..okay? One of us on our Death bed is enough..
  "
3431,"
   Your family is the laughing stock of the multiverse
  ","
  ..Maybe if the entire multiverse didn't always beat us down we wouldn't be..*Reaper mutters under his breath*..
  "
3432,"
   Do I look like Geno to you!? *Cross takes out his sword and swings it down at Death* I don't give a shít about your excuses either! You dusted me and several monsters by destroying timeliness that weren't meant to be destroyed!
  ","
  *Reaper instinctively summons his scythe to block Crosses sword since
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  is literally right beside him, that sword swing would have hit more than just Reaper if he didn't block it*
  
  ....Your not... a-are you Cross!? W-what did you do with Geno..!?
  "
3433,"
   *Cross teleports to ReaperTale and kicks down the door to Deaths house* Hey AŞŞHOLE!! Did you forget about dusting me and destroying Dreams home!?
  ","
  ..*Reaper had just woken back up and he confuses Cross for Geno, that's how 'sick' he is, does Cross really want to kick someone while they're down?*
  
  ..Geno..? But..I never dusted you Love.. and.. destroying DreamTale.. I did that when I was a Error... I didn't..have control of myself then...
  "
3434,"
   Ew?? Are you sick???
  ","
  ..*Reaper doesn't answer and just flops beside
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  but you can tell he's not okay*
  "
3435,"
   Ok?*give him one*
  ","
  Thanks..*Halluciv might want to talk with
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  instead who is cureently sitting right beside Reaper since he's currently tossing up his cookies in the bag Halluciv gave him* ..
  "
3436,"
   What?Are you ok dude??
  ","
  ..Y-yeah..I'm fine...just..hand me..a bag or...something.. please?
  "
3437,"
   The good news is epic rescued nova.
  ","
  That's good..I think..can't remember who Epic and Nova are though...
  "
3438,"
   Yeah I'm fine, please just get some rest
  ","
  Heh..you really are a worry wart.. okay..I'll rest up some more but..you better be telling the truth..I do care about you..you know.. your the light to my dark..
  "
3439,"
   I'm literally within arm's reach of you Reaper... just go back to sleep every time you're awake you say something that nearly gives me a soul attack
  ","
  *Reaper pauses as he needed a moment to process that*
  
  ..S-sorry Love.. maybe..I should go back to sleep...but..before I do..are you okay? I remember..you said something about..ketchup..yesterday..I don't remember anything past that..
  "
3440,"
   I'm still sitting right here Reaper *Literally Reaper had just rolled over and was facing away from Geno, he hadn't gone anywhere*
  ","
  *The fact Reaper didn't recognize that Geno was beside him, probably doesn't help the poor Tsun, he doesn't seem to realize he had rolled over at all either* You are..? But..I don't see you..!
  "
3441,"
   Well technically  I'm in yours. Not mine. But yeah you okay?
  ","
  ..I feel like Death..*Reaper forces a smile to try and pass that off as a joke* how about you..? Have..you seen Geno..by chance?
  "
3442,"
   Hehe. Yeah I mean I still spread negative emotions  to balance out my brothers positive  ones.  But I ain't evil like my brother tells everyone.

  ...Are we still in the same multiverse?

3443,"
   DS  Nightmare but I go by Halluciv!*smiles warmly*

  ..I think I know why your called Halluciv...this is one giant ""Halluciv-ation"" ..a version of Nightmare this nice..can't be real..

3444,"
   Umm..Its a has it's own multiverse  around it!
  ","
  ..Oh..right.. thanks..*Reaper said while rubbing his eye sockets*..and...who are you again?
  
  *Poor Halluciv lol*
  "
3445,"
   Dreamswap yeah!
  ","
  ..What's a Dreamswap again? *Oof*
  "
3446,"
   *Dream decides to try healing Reaper as best he can*
  ","
  *Hopefully next time he wakes up he'll be doing far better than he was, Dreams healing magic is just as if not more powerful than Lifes*
  "
3447,"
   *Geno cuffs Reaper to the bed* I need more ketchup
  ","
  ..hnnh..? *Reaper noticed he was actually handcuffed to the bed but he doesn't say anything about it, he's honestly not capable of speaking much right now even though he wants to, he wants to know why Geno said he needs more ketchup too but instead he ends up dozing off* ..
  "
3448,"
   I see you met Halluciv, he's the Nightmare from Dreamswap
  ","
  *Reaper gave a faint nod to Dream but he doesn't speak a word as he laid against
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  the Death God is in truly terrible shape*
  "
3449,"
   Well whatever the case you’re staying right here
  ","
  ...*Reaper then falls silent as he laid against Geno, all you hear is his heavy breathing as he was desperately trying to catch his breath, he really wasn't doing well*
  "
3450,"
   Nightmare asking for help??? This other Dream must really have him shaken up...
  ","
  Either that..or this other..Dream is..that..b-big of a threat..*Reaper then lays against Geno, gripping at his chest, he was in that bad of shape he was out of breath just from talking* .. ..

3451,"
   I go by Halluciv but yeah Nightmare is also my name. You okay? *looks at him hes cute like  classic dream*
  ","
  *Hey
  
   @WelcomeToMySpecialHell
  
  you used to look so cute what happened lol*

  Halluciv? ..Your from the..Swap..multiverse..aren't you?

3452,"
   *Geno clinks Reaper’s teeth* please just rest....
  ","
  *Reaper happily clinks his teeth back and just gives Geno a smile* ..O-okay.. you win..I'll rest..but..we still..h-have a problem..with another version of Dream... N-Nightmare actually texted me for help..*he looks towards his cellphone laying on the nightstand beside them* he asked..me to..round up the Gods..in ReaperTale..I only told Asgore..so far.. ..he has Undyne outside..guarding our house..and went off to get Gaster..
  "
3453,"
   My brother is crazy yes.. *you notice a cute version of nightmare *
  ","
  *Reaper just stares at the other version of Nightmare, he's honestly in shock* ...Uuhhh...Nightmare..?
  "
3454,"
   Then please stop pushing yourself like this *Geno hugs the god tearing up badly*
  ","
  *Aw..**Reaper opens a eye when he feels Geno hugging him and he's shocked to see his Tsundere was..crying? He was actually crying on him, was Geno that afraid of losing him?* ..L-Love.. *he then rests a arm over Genos shoulder, he honestly didn't have the strength to even hug him properly*..
  "
3455,"
   *Geno gets Reaper back in bed sighing* are you trying to permanently incapacitate yourself??
  ","
  *Once back in bed, the Death God closes his eyes as he takes a moment to catch his breath* .. ....n-no.. ..but.. ..ugh..
  "
3456,"
   The reason Marvul grabbed Nova is cause Anons convinced him she was being corrupted by Nightmare so he's ""saving"" her from being corrupted by negativity, they also gave him the bright idea to make her his queen -__-
  ","
  ..T-that's just..great.. no wonder N-Nightmare asked for help..

3457,"
   *Geno catches Reaper when he stumbles* well you’re in no condition to go try dealing with it
  ","
  ..G-Geno..*Reaper just lays limp in Genos arms, it's true he's in no shape to fight, if he does, he would be dust in a instant, he couldn't even hold himself up right now and just from being out of bed, he was struggling to breathe* ..hngh..
  "
3458,"
   I’ve been at your side the past two weeks why would I leave now
  ","
  Heh.. w-well..we kinda..h-have a situation..*Reaper takes a few steps towards Geno but he ends up collapsing* urk!

3459,"
   Bad idea Reaper *I wake up to this -__-*
  ","
  *Lol**Reaper looks back when he hears Geno* W-what are you d-doing here?

3460,"
   ...I'll get Gaster immediately. Stay here, I'll have Undyne keep you safe. Farewell. *Leaves* *Determined goat dad*
  ","
  W-wait--! I'm going with you..! *Are you sure that's a good idea?*
  "
3461,"
   What?! *Shocked goat king* A version of Dream hurting everyone??? Are you sure? That's rather hard to believe...
  ","
  I wouldn't of believed it..if Nightmare himself didn't actually come to me for help.. I w-would of rather not get you and the others involved..but in the c-current state I'm in.. I know I wouldn't last long in a fight..*Reaper sighed* I..I hate saying it but..I need your help this time..
  "
3462,"
   Howdy Reaper! Hope I'm not interrupting anything!
  ","
  A-Asgore!? *Reaper looks back at the goat God in sheer shock* Your not..but we..we kinda have a problem.. there's a version of Dream t-thats slaying everyone in order to make the entire multiverse ""happy"" ..
  "
3463,"
   And don't think this makes us friends. Hopefully your Asgore will be able to do something. Bye
  ","
  Well f-ck..
  "
3464,"
   Um, Sure I can do that!

  teleporting them both to the save screen with the bed he was sitting on*
  
  You both should be safe here..

  ""But he can't kiII Geno cause he's in Limbo but on the other hand I don't really want him trying to kiII him either, for now I'll help you but don't think this makes me a minion of yours""

  ..I might..have to cut our meeting short..you know..being Death..and all..I have a pretty busy job..but since your here..can you watch over Geno while I'm out? You said your friends right?
  "
3467,"
   *Texts you on your phone* Yo, Nova's been kidnapped, Dreamswap is trying to take over, tell the other gods and Geno
  ","
  *Reaper texts back*
  
  ""First off how the heII did you get my number? Second, Dreamswap is that big of a threat to you that you need our help? And third, Why would they kidnap Nova? I didn't think Marvul was into h-ntai like you""
  
  *burned*

3468,"
   Um, hi! I'm Sakura I know we haven't but I just want to come in...don't worry I'm a friend of Geno.

  *A blue chain then opens the door*
  
  ..A friend of Genos? You better be telling the truth..
  "
3469,"
   How are you and Geno?

3470,"
   *Knock, knock*
  ","
  Mnnh? *Reaper wasn't fully awake but he heard the knocks at their door* who is it..?
  "
3471,"
   I've been pretty outta it, I had no idea if you had fallen down or not, but healthwise I'm fine
  ","
  *Reaper rests his skull against Genos hand as he closed his eyes again*..Sorry Geno..
  
  *he doesn't want to scare Geno even more and wants to reassure him but he doesn't have the energy to keep his eyes open let alone talk, he seemed really wiped out*
  "
3472,"
   Almost a week actually
  ","
  ..A week..? ..Sorry Love..*Reaper gave a weak smile* guess..I'm in worse..shape than I thought..are you doing okay..?
  "
3473,"
   More like a few days....
  ","
  *Reaper reopens his lone eye slightly* ..days..?
  "
3474,"
   Well this is really happening *Geno sighs in relief and just pets Reaper's skull* You scared me more than half to you, you know

  *Reaper then closes his eye sockets when Geno pet his skull*
  
  ..T-that..feels..better.. ..h-huh? Heh..sorry Love.. didn't mean to scare you.. I was only out..for a few minutes..

3475,"
   Reaper? Are you actually waking up or is this just another dream of mine?

3476,"
   *Reaper fell comatose and Geno didn't exactly take it well, he spent most of the time just depressed drinking ketchup but the rest of the time he spent at Reaper's bedside*

   I'm in better condition than you are, were you attacked?!? *he doesn't want to accept the most obvious answer*

  Geno..*Reaper sighs* ..I ..I wasn't attacked..but..you should really be back home resting.. you were hit pretty hard..remember?

  Back to when I first met Geno..times were a lot more simple then...

3495,"
   before you do anything insane, maybe talk to Error about hearing voices

  *What he has done to himself was censored at Reapers request but you can guess what happened by looking at his scythe where the blade was covered in blœd as it laid beside him*
  
  ..A little..late for the..don't do anything part..but I'm not talking to anyone..about this..I'll be fine..

3496,"
   The only thing you're going to do is calm down and when you're nice and calm, go work things out with Geno.

  Let's see..got pushed past my breaking point from the attacks on me and my family..turned myself into a Error..went through unbelievable pain..attacked everyone in my path..terrified the heII out of Geno by going insane as a Error..thought about destroying this entire multiverse from it..threatened our own kiddos..and now.. he thought I was leaving him permanently..when I just..can't handle it all right now..I don't wanna seem like I'm complaining...or seem like I'm making this all about me..but..I can't..I can't handle it right now..I know Geno deals with far more than I do and he's been poisoned and shot by arrows on top being put in limbo, forever bleeding with only a shard of a Soul left and..I tried to do everything possible to protect him and our kiddos but..it just..backfires.. I just.. just..need a few minutes..I'm s-still messed up from when I was a Error...

   Reaper, what exactly happened? You two seem miserable

  *Reaper flops down in his timelines version of waterfall and just curls up, crying into his knees* ..God so much has happened!! W-where do I even start!?

   Candy:I best be going! Ccino has been calling asking where i've been! Bye!*vanishes*
Life:Alright where is he?

Candy:I found someone!^^

  *Reaper then looks at both Life and Candy Sans who returned* You mean--You really came through with it?

  Good, now leave that bag and coffee on the nightstand and leave before i change my mind and reap you..

  *Why are they so cute--it makes me feel bad--* How about we make a deal instead..you find someone to care for Geno and I spare you from experiencing heII so you can still help your friend, how's that sound?

   wouldn't candytale go to Life's Garden?
  ","
  He is supposed to whenever he actually dies..but since I've already broken nearly every rule in ReaperTale..I don't see why I can't dust him and send him to the Underworld..

3520,"
   Candy: Both! I help him sometimes with his shop but we are mostly just friends! He pays me in free drinks, food and gold sometime. He's a pretty nice monster  but sometimes he can get overwhelmed. He wanted to make sure you guys got your delivery  *tries to hand you the bag*
  ","
  Huh..well thanks for the delivery but as payment your about to be paid in more than just free drinks, how would you like a free trip to the Underworld?

   ok so definitely not you

  .....*It took Reaper a few minutes to process that*... WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN!?

3525,"
   They did look after Geno that week you were off becoming an Error

3526,"
   and what about your kids?
  ","
  What about them? They usually stay with their friends when me and Geno aren't available to care for them..
  "
3527,"
   So what is your plan now, you can't really leave Geno on his own after all
  ","
  I'm leaving as soon as either A. he's better or B. Someone else that's trustworthy will watch him  like Error..I personally hate him but I know that he loves Geno and wouldn't let anything happen to him..

3528,"
   Bye...!!*runs the hell away lol*

  I'M GOING TO REAP YOUR SOUL LATER!!! *Yeah he should run poor smol lol*

  ...My top priority right now is Geno..who needs help..and he can't get the help he needs if I dust every monster who comes our way..now can he? Just go..m-maybe get him to let me loose while your at it..

3531,"
   It was meant for Geno actually but um okay!*sweats* 
""Hey geno, i know you told me to not come back because of your husband but i thought i'd still drop off stuff for you guys and not come in. I feel bad for you and hope reaper will get better. Here's my info if you need me. Best of luck to you.""

  ...*Reaper just sighs and has his chains set Ccino down*.. ..Don't get the wrong idea kiddo...I can and WILL still kiII you..but not right now..just take this stuff and that note of yours to Geno before I change my damn mind..
  
  *Oof he's not that friendly anymore--*

3532,"
   Ah..!! Okay okay! Um the note? It's not important just throw it away. Yeah. *embarrassed*

  Good...and I'll be the judge of that...*A chain then picks up the note and he began to read it anyway lol*

3533,"
   Home...? Im keeping up with my end of the deal...! *nervous*

  I think I recall asking you to help me with

3534,"
   *ccino leaves  them donuts,sweets, and cappuccino in a bag for reaper on their doorstep with a note*
  ","
  *Aw**However blue chains seem to grab Ccino as soon as he tried to leave, he may notice their door was open, open enough that Reaper was able to spot him* Hey kiddo, perfect timing~ Where do you think your going?
  "
3535,"
   Uhm even if you destroyed the whole multiverse besides you and Geno there's still people from outside the multiverse who could be threats
  ","
  Well then..if they decide to be a problem I'll destroy their world too while I'm at it! Being the Grim Reaper comes in handy sometimes..since Death can happen at any place at any time..

3536,"
   oh man when you remember everything you did it's gonna be like being hit by a bus. Is Geno still scared of you?
  ","
  ..W-what are you--*Reaper then pushes himself up in a seated position and rubs his skull, he needs a few minutes to get awake* Geno..!? He--t-that wasn't a nightmare!?

You've taken the antidote for the poison but that doesn't change the fact you were still hit by arrows from someone here in ReaperTale who will personally die by Deaths hand when he finds them..you really need to stay in bed and quit worrying about me.. if I'm dead there really isn't much left TO worry about..

   I mean i've been bullied alot its nice to pick on someone else... Do you really think IM a threat?I couldnt beat either of you in a fight!! I can barely handle kids my age!! I got m-rdered by my bullies before! I like making some else feel bad even if its you a grown skeleton..
  ","
  *Reaper pinches the bridge of his non existent nose* Kids can be surprising...Geno was kiIIed by a kid and said kiddo destroyed his timeline, destroyed most of my timeline and kiIIed one of us Gods, trapped Geno on the Save screen where he was forced to watch his brother get murđered over and over again by them and not to mention a kiddo stole my scythe and gave me a corrupted fake one so I go out of control on a kiIIing spree.. we didn't expect a kid, whether it's a human or monster, to be capable of that much destruction.. we learned not to take our chances..
  
  You definitely don't seem like your capable of that.. but there was still that chance you could shock the heII out of us and strike us down..
  
  And..another thing..if you want people to stop harming you, you shouldn't harm them..if they strike first you should of told your parents to back you up..me and Geno would scare the heII out of anyone who messed with our kiddos..
  "
3672,"
   kinda surprised this kid came back after Geno sicced a baster beast on him, I'm not sure if that's brave or really really stupid

  Geno summoned his blaster beasts..and this kiddo came right back after that.. well..maybe he needs scared to Death..*Uh are you sure your up for that?*
  "
3673,"
   I kinda insulted you a bunch called my own dad a joke and he told me to never come back and i cant hang out with your kids can you talk him down? I mean i was just joking! My dad doesnt fall for it as much as you two do..
  ","
  ..Look at it from our point of view..most people either feel sorry for Geno..think he needs to be rushed to a hospital or attack him just for the way he looks.. and being literal Death, you have more enemies than anything just for doing your job and reaping those whose time is up.. we don't take insults lightly cause they come off as threats kiddo..anyone that usually insults us, attacks us..
  
  You have actually attacked me just to get me to fight back..so yeah..point proven..*Reaper huffed*

3674,"
   Well...

  *Reaper was kinda out of commission when Geno and Torn fought so he doesn't know what happened and honestly Torn has some balls to come back after being chased by a blaster beast XD*

  G-Geno..!? *Reaper looks back at Geno with his lone eye wide, other than a slightly singed wing he was perfectly fine and his scythe blade was also covered in blœd giving it away that it might not be his own, alongside the purplish wing on the ground*
  
  ..If..you can believe it..it's actually not from me.. I..I actually did that..to Nova.. heh.. it's not like I wanted to hurt her..but..I honestly didn't think I could hurt anyone in any fight..*he pulls down his hood*

Did..did she actually retreat..? ..I really won..? And..*he then looks at his scythe* n-not that I wanted to hurt her but..

  I don't give a sh-t!! We're all hurt because I'm not powerful enough to protect us!! *Reaper pauses as he began coughing*

  *Reaper winces as he started gripping at his Soul, he's in no shape to be getting worked up like this* ..owww...W-will Geno be fine?? This..is the last straw..I'm gonna do what I should of done i-in the first place! I'm gonna become a Error and none of you will stop me!

3835,"
   Uh, no, you're staying right here
  ","
  *Reaper then closes his eyes as he laid against Geno, he's very weak now, if Geno listens he can hear Reaper gasping and wheezing just from trying to move, he doesn't even have it in him to argue back, he just falls silent after Geno told him he's staying there, if it wasn't for the magic IV, he would of probably dusted if not fallen down*..

   Why not wait on this idea of yours until you’re feeling better
  ","
  ..W-we..*cough* don't..h-have time..t-to wait..on recovering.. *Reaper takes a moment and wipes a bit of blœd from his mouth* I-I can..t-teleport..if you..lay m-me down..so..I don't t-take you..with me.. ..

3837,"
   It isn't an idea that will get you dusted right?

  N-no..but..it's still one..your against..*Reaper then tries to move himself out of Genos arms but he couldn't manage to even lift himself a inch off Geno, instead all it did was cause him to start coughing*..

   It would be a nice change of pace that's for sure, why do you ask?

  ..*Reaper has a dark look in his lone eye before it vanishes from sight* B-because..I have a i-idea.. that might h-help us..
  "
3839,"
   Well it didn't, I made it through, just like I always do. You and the kids give me something to live for, I'm not letting anything tear us apart, even if that means fighting the whole multiverse *He just nuzzles his skull against Reaper*
  ","
  *Aw**Reaper just smiles with tears now streaming down his skull once again as he laid it against Genos* ..Geno.. but what if..we didn't n-need to fight the multiverse?

3840,"
   *Geno lightly wraps his arms around Reaper from behind* Hey, what do you mean you can't do this, you know I'll always have your back

  G-Geno..heh..*Reaper was surprised and just let's himself lean back in Genos arms, his aura calming down a bit*
  
  ..H-having my back..nearly cost you yours...

3841,"
   No..That GV sans or bad bro sans are pretty high on my #sshole ratings. They both kidnapped me one tried to force me to marry him the other made me his personal maid..

  *Reaper then takes some donuts out of the bag and noms on them, he actually stopped crying after eating donuts* ..T-thanks..

3846,"
   Opal: *gives you a donut*

3847,"
   Yeah, tired though *he starts dozing off against Reaper*

  *Once Geno dozed off Reaper had continued begging for donuts since he was still awake and in tears* ..i-if not donuts t-then someone get me bleach..! Please! T-today was the worst d-day of our lives!

3849,"

  C-can I ..still get a d-donut..?

3850,"
   *well it probably saved Reaper from spilling the beans about the Ghost Apples, Geno's now even more confused*

  *Reaper tries to calm himself so he can at least be there for Geno and not keep freaking out his poor Tsundere* ..S-sorry..sorry! Y-you okay..?

3851,"
   *he lifts up reapers robs and a injects him with an antidote it burns   painfully but it will go away eventually* There.In a couple  hours you will be positively toxin free.

  I WANNA DOOONNNNNUUTTT!! *Reaper started crying his eyes out after he got the shot lol yep that's the almighty powerful God of Death lol*
  "
3852,"
   W-What? *Geno just looks at him utterly confused*
  ","
  *Reaper was going to say more but he got injected with the same syringe Geno took and he is not as strong willed as Geno, but then again he doesn't have Determination and he's more similar to a normal monster, but soon after he got injected with it he starts bawling his eyes out into his Tsundere and gripped onto Genos sleeve as tight as possible*
  "
3853,"
   Alright hold still this will quick.*takes out syringe *

  H-heh..y-you are a lot stronger t-than you look..*Reaper gives a faint smile back* b-but..still..t-this..this shouldn't of happened..I-I'm sorry Love.. *he then buries his skull into Genos shoulder* t-this was..all m-my fault.. I took off her muzzle..I t-thought I could help her..but t-this happened instead.. just..I felt I had to try helping.. ..A-Allura knows my secret..a-and if you found out..y-you'd look at me the same way everyone sees monsters like Horror and Nightmare..! *Reaper is a bit hysterical and delirious right now so he's blurting out a few things he normally wouldn't* I c-cant let that happen! I don't want you f-fearing me..! I wouldn't mind everyone else fearing me, it would keep us safe if they did..and m-my job would be easier.. B-but-- not you..!

3855,"
   Yeah I'll be fine now, doesn't hurt as bad as the DT anyway

   * *Geno just rests his skull against Reaper*
  ","
  *Oh Reaper noticed, he's giving them both passing glares even though this IS partially his fault for removing Plagues restraints but his intentions were good, he was trying to help her but ..maybe he should start asking Geno for his opinion before acting on impulse* I-its Okay Love..y-you'll be f-fine..*he sounds like he's trying to reassure himself more than Geno, he was really afraid for his Tsundere*
  "
3857,"
   cause while you were poisoned our soul bond was crumbling away, I had to do something *Their soulbond is weakened but still clearly there*
  ","
  G-Geno..*Reaper just lays his skull on top of Genos, he's doing his best to try and comfort him since he can't exactly do much more than that in his current state and he knows Geno won't allow him to take back the poison when he risks dying from it*...

3858,"
   If my soul f-fragment can handle all that D-DT it c-can handle a l-lethal poison

  D-did..did you..take t-the poison I had? *Reaper just now figured it out*..W-why would you do that!?!? You deal w-with enough j-just with your k-kiII wound! *he starts tearing up as he stared into Genos lone eye*

3859,"
   T-Toxin bite... c-can't k!ll someone... already d-dead
  ","
  ..W-what!? But--you were--*Reaper looks confused* h-how!? Just--h-hold on Love..! *it won't cure the poison but he's hoping the Life flower at least eases the pain he's in, he takes a Life flower from his robe and uses it on Geno*
  "
3860,"
   Y-you better be ok *he's on his hands and knees bleeding worse than usual, blood pouring from his mouth as his bones rattle just from propping himself up*

  G-Geno..!? *Reaper then forces himself up so he can be at Genos side and gently pulls his Tsun to him so he can lean against him* W-what happened..!?
  "
3861,"
   *Geno is desperate so he links their souls closer, and begins to take the poison into his own Soul fragment. By the time Reaper is toxin-free Geno isn't doing too hot, but being in Limbo it can't k!ll him*

  *Mod is internally screaming because now they're both suffering--**Reaper coughs a bit as he started to regain consciousness and looks around* ...nnngh..w-what..?

   Sh!t! She bit him, she f-cking bit him and I don't have any of that damned antidote *yeah I don't think Plague is welcome anymore*

3865,"
   I feel better than I have in a few days, but you clearly still need rest
  ","
  Geno I--*Although before Reaper could finish speaking, Plague had bit his arm, causing the God to topple over with his IV stands, he thought he was helping Plague by getting rid of unnecessary restraints and allowing her to eat some donuts but those restraints turned out to actually be necessary*
  "
3866,"
   Rora:Listen i dont think ANYTHING is going to help Plague now shes to far gone..*meanwhile when reaper wasnt paying attention plague BITES him on the arm even if his  d3ath touch is active it gets him luckily being a god it should only make him sick not k!ll him like a normal monster.*
  ","
  *Oh sh-t--I honestly did not see that coming--**Reaper was just about to reach for his hourglass when he feels his arm get bit, Plague is lucky his Death wasn't active but it will be now if she doesn't let loose of his arm, the Death God ends up collapsing to the ground with a thud, dropping his hourglass* sh-t..!
  "
3867,"
   Reaper?!?! *Geno woke up to Reaper missing*
  ","
  *Oof**Geno may spot Reaper ""standing"" next to Plague and Rora, he wasn't in bed but he didn't leave their room, honestly it would probably be too difficult for him to travel very far in his condition or carry the 2 IVs hooked to his Soul*
  
  ..Geno!? Y-you okay??
  "
3868,"
   Rora:But dad does that when he's mad at me... *plague is struggling to open the bag thanks to her cute mittens she cant take off* Plague:No grr!!*starts to chew on her mittens*
  ","
  Heh..and they say I-I'm bad..look kiddo, you don't hit s-someone you care about...parents only smack their kiddos when they do something w-wrong..like Raven throwing rocks t-through our windows.. here..*Reaper then uses his Death touch to well, destroy the mittens which is probably a bad decision, actually everything he's doing right now seems like awful decisions*
  
  Maybe..if I erase her memory..it'll go back to normal?
  "
3869,"
   Rora:No we havent told her.. We didnt want to worry her..But i think being attacked like that might of triggered her predator instincts.. 
Plague:Food!*she almost bites reaper's hand but rora stop her grabbing the donuts himself*
Rora:No biting!*slaps her lol*
  ","
  I think you s-should of told your m-mom so she..doesn't think Plague is crazy--*Reaper intervenes and catches Roras hand before he slaps her* H-hey! Hitting her isn't helping..!
  "
3870,"
   Rora: Yeah it was from GVtale..There were some teenagers who decided to attack her because of how she looked..I tried to stop them but something snapped in her and she uh...Mauled and ate her attackers..It was scary!!
Plague:Can i have a bite please?*she means she wants his arm lol*
  ","
  ..Does your m-mom know about this? *Reaper them frowned as he dug into his robe, pulling out a small bag of donuts, holding his hand out for Plague to take them* you can have.. these but no e-eating people..okay?

   Plague:Some bad monsters hurt me...So I ATE them hehe!^^
Rora:Yeah uh...

  Bad monsters? W-was it from..that AU..we found you in? *Reaper then looks at Rora* mind... explaining?

3872,"
   Rora:It might be trauma based...We went through some trouble..But now shes   crazier now..Like i'm afraid she might bite dad and k!ll him with her toxin bite...
Plague:I feel like a caged doggy!

  *Reaper let's out a sigh before getting himself up out of bed, he's using his magic to float so he's able to get up and look like he's walking*

3873,"
   Rora:She's kinda crazy with hunger she can't hurt anyone or herself this way. Check out what she did to me.*shows off horrible gnawed on bond arms*

   Shh let me patch you up *though Geno's gonna sedate him this time so he can't tear open his stitches or anything*

   I'm learning how to be a professional at drawing Anime drawings! Why? Because I was just interested on to being a better drawer. I'm not that bad...well...it just I may have a hard time on the face or the rest of the body (which I don't always get to draw that much of it maybe half but I can try).
  ","
  *For me I have to have something to base my drawings after, if I don't have some sort of picture to look at while I draw, it doesn't always turn out the way I hoped, whenever I draw without any pictures for reference, I always feel like it's never good enough and I get disappointed with myself..maybe try looking at a picture to base some of your drawings after? Or if you have too much trouble, I first learned to draw by tracing the covers off my anime DVDs, there's also bases out there to help beginners, I've used a few to help myself improve c: it helped me draw hands a bit better and to not make the characters size wrong like having one arm longer than the other*

   I don't either, Even if Allura and Socket remembered each other it's not like Allura could take care of him, she's too busy making her own poor life choices. Reaper Socket's best bet may be asylumtale, they are skilled to deal with problematic monsters. Besides with no memory he'd be safest tbc

  ..The whole point of wiping her memory was so you both could go your separate ways without harming eachother...this is her personality before she had you around..she was being a ""jerk"" because to her you were a stranger she rescued..you should of just left kiddo..actually, I probably should of erased your memory along with hers...

   @DontcallmeSans
  
  is still asleep before speaking* Admittedly.. I ate those apples because..uh..what I told Geno about us Gods not needing to eat or sleep..was a complete lie..*Reaper rubs the back of his skull* if that were true..Life wouldn't be growing food in her garden..and we wouldn't have beds.. truth is..I'm not exactly liked here in ReaperTale.. I can get along with some of the other Gods like our Alphys, Grillby, Asgore and Paps of course but all the rest here hate me..I used to be close with Life but our friendship burned down the moment I reaped Chara.. point is, at the time when I met Lady Death, Life had cut me off from the food in her garden..we weren't getting along.. and our magic is the opposite of eachother so before you say I could just teleport in and take what I want, her magic can do serious damage against me and the same goes for mine, if me or her ever got into a fight against eachother we would probably dust eachother, anyway I was pretty hungry.. so when Lady Death offered me something to eat, I took her up on her offer and ate some ghost apples, I figured it wouldn't hurt anything and nobody would ever have to know we ate them.. well until now..now more people know about it thanks to her..I'm afraid of what would happen if Geno or the other Gods found out..I would probably lose my job and Geno.. he would be afraid of me..

  What!? *Reaper then forces himself up using his scythe to help hold him* D-did she try to eat him!?

   Hehe...*tears stream* It really  shows what kinda person I am. I'm a coward like they said. When the goings got tough I bailed on everyone. I pushed my kids into a bad place because I thought that AU was helping them. You don't know how good you have things till you lose it all.

  Kiddo.. okay look..I know we d-dont exactly get along..so you might not l-listen to me but..if you did move there for y-your kiddos then your heart was in the r-right place but how you d-did everything was bad..picked the wrong AU and found the wrong crowd..left your friends and family behind..
  
  ..but none of that a-answers my question..do you love Horror?
  "
3990,"
   I know but.. I thought i could handle his problems.. That i could FIX him but dust was right..He'll never change and I can't take him from his AU either.Now we have two kids Rora and Plague.But every time I look at her it hurts. She has his hungry and is a ""monster"" like HIM..

  ...*Reaper is honestly nervous about this conversation, it's making him uncomfortable since unlike Horror and Allura, he and Geno had stuck together through everything thrown their way, even when Reaper was corrupted by Hatred, Geno didn't fear him and instead tried to help him, even with the anons trying to drive them apart, they still stood together*
  
  ...Do you love Horror?

   awkward conversation award goes to...

  Y-you can say that again..kinda weird..she would ask me..of all people..for advice..*Reaper chuckled faintly before coughing, honestly he doesn't seem well enough to even be having this conversation, he could barely keep his eyes open*..uuurrrrggghhh..

3992,"
   You're the only monster I think that would understand.... Am In the wrong that iabandoned my husband taking the kids and trying to start a new life with another sans because  horror scares me? I know I shouldn't fear be afraid of him but I am.. It's not his fault  right?He can't help being well HIM.

  ...*Reaper fumbles a bit with the strings on his robe, he doesn't seem to know ecactly how to answer* ...Kiddo.. if you don't love Horror..and wanted to leave him..I-I would of at least talked to him about it..leaving w-without a trace and just vanishing on him was wrong... and..you don't f-fear someone your in love with..Geno doesn't fear me..and I'm literal Death.. Horror c-cant help the way he is c-cause his t-timeline is really f-cked up....

   Reaper, for when you're conscious some anon nailed Geno in the skull with a baseball bat. Hard, he's been out cold for hours now

  Heh..that's true.. not all days are Grim.. *Reaper then closes his eye again and lets himself rest against Geno, if you didn't know any better you would think he was just tired but his breathing says otherwise, it sounded similar to a 'Death rattle' which it honestly would be awful if Geno had his husband die on his birthday*

  Neither of us can die here! I don't see the point! *Reaper flies up in the air using his wings to avoid being impaled and summons his blue magic imbued chains to not only stop Horror but to yeet him out of there through a portal he's made using his scythe* We can tear eachother apart later! Just get out of here!

   WE AREN'T DONE HERE!! *Horror grabs Deaths arm so he teleports with him* I'm going to kick your fųcking aşş!

4013,"
   YOU TAKE THAT BACK!!! She wouldn't take off and leave! She knows my timeline has no food there, we're FORCED to eat whatever we can find, even if it's eachother! The ones who refuse to eat starve to death..

  Look, point is..your cannibalism scares the sh-t out of everyone..even SOCKET is scared of you!

4016,"
   Uhm Reaper, maybe bringing
   
    @ToxinTale
   
   back to your place was a bad idea. Looks like all she wants to do is go back to the hell hole she was living in, you got yourself maimed for apparently no reason, and I think she triggered Geno on his birthday

  Damn it.. what happened between her and Geno? Today isn't supposed to go like this! This birthday backfired royally.. I'll have to talk to both of the--*Reaper pauses as he started coughing out bits of blœd and you hear him hit the floor not long after*

   Wouldnt you do the same if it make them happier? I get jealous of her kids horror and papyrus. I dont share well. She wont have to fight for me anymore she can live her life.Be happy. We werent meant to be.It will hurt but i have to.

  Because Kiddo, I've been where you are..
  
  I don't know if you know but..I was created by Gaster and Asgore to reap Souls that they weren't capable of reaping..the whole point of my existence was to be this cold heartless kiIIer who wouldn't hesitate to reap someone dead or alive..
  
  All the other Gods here don't have the heart to kiII or take a Soul without feeling guilty..except Gaster but he just plain didn't want the job..problem was..I didn't turn out the way they wanted..
  
  they made me too powerful where I had little to no control over my powers and nearly destroyed the entire timeline..and I had emotions which was the opposite of what they wanted.. so to fix it..Gaster put me through heII so I wouldn't be able to feel anything anymore..these holes in my hands came from him..
  
  After a few years Gaster didn't think he made any progress with me so he made Painless, the supposed to be better God of Death to replace me..my brother.. his powers are more balanced than mine..they didn't go haywire and he could fully control them unlike me..but problem was..he had emotions like I did and was far too kind..he was so sweet and inoccent even Gaster got attached to him, all the Gods adored my brother but despised me..*Reaper looks away* none of them were okay with him going out to dangerous timelines and he couldn't bring himself to take any Souls that didn't want to die..he couldn't bring himself to hurt anyone period..that's the only reason why I'm still here..unlike Paps..I was capable of doing the harder jobs after Gaster broke me in.. I lost the ability to feel anything towards anyone making me the cold kiIIer they wanted.. at least until I met Geno and Life then everything changed..she taught me what it was like to have a friend and how to care about someone other than yourself and Geno..taught me what it was like to love and be loved..
  
  Your not all that different from me kiddo...you were made to be this perfect little brother but it all backfired..I wanna help you..

   *Geno just looks at Reaper* after everything he's done? All the times he's tried to kill you or me or our kids? Sadly I think his only peace would be sleep or... well nonexistence
  ","
  I know..don't agree with everything he's done either especially when it came to him almost killing you and the kiddos..that was a huge strike..but.. it also wasn't entirely him in control there..all those dead monsters trapped together..forced back to life to give him life..they're all out for revenge and control his actions.. almost like what Chara did to me..giving me a fake scythe filled with her Hatred so I go out of control.. I wasn't the one in control of my actions..she was.. and everyone thought it was me being crazy...
  
  ...besides..not even sure we can wipe him from existence or make him sleep with how glitched he is..

  ...*Reaper was hesitant, he isn't sure this is a good idea considering spirits/ghosts can interact with him being he's you know Death, but truth be told he really feels bad since he does understand Socket, they were both mistakes that were created, Gaster and Asgore made Reaper but he was flawed so they created Painless in a attempt to create a better God of Death but even though Painless had more balanced out powers like they wanted he was too kind hearted to fully replace him which is why there's 2 Gods of Death instead of one, Socket on the other hand was created to be a perfect little brother but with all the mashed up monster Souls and parts it made him a literal monster instead, all those monsters fused together made him crazy and nobody wanted him around because of it, everyone wanted to help him but they couldn't*

  *Holy sh-t I actually feel bad for him but at the same time he's so crazy--**Reaper is actually afraid now, he reaped Socket and caused his true form to show, if he gets revived he might seek revenge for Reaper causing this to begin with..no wonder his relationship with Allura was confusing..he both hated and loved her*

4071,"
   Amalgamates are usually held together by Determination, so you wouldn't have reaped one before. This is what he is truly like

  Pfft, what's the matter? Cat got your tongue? *Reaper pauses for a moment after hearing Melvin* I think I very well can blame you, you meet a talking skeleton and tell them they aren't real..not to mention you insulted the Love of my life..then burned down our house..

   What!?How!? Why?! You're not gonna  get away  with this!!*angry nerd*
  ","
  *Lol that made me think of the angry video game nerd*

  Yeah, help me put out a fire that YOU started, your mod had a point

4123,"
   You have that kind of power and intimidation already. The only reason it doesn't feel like it is cause the few people in the multiverse willing to mess with you, really like messing with you.
  ","
  .. ..The last person I managed to intimidate was a mouse... a f-cking mouse..you have any idea how humiliating that was? If the other Gods knew I wouldn't hear the end of it..nobody is fearing Death anymore, they all see Death as a joke now.. Ink, I NEED this! I can't do my job properly anymore! If Undyne knew, I would lose my position! As much as I would like that, with my powers, I wouldn't be able to do anything else! I wouldn't know what to do with myself! I can't leave ReaperTale with my powers capable of dusting anyone near me..I need something, ANYTHING to make me stronger! To show that I'm a force to be reckoned with not just monsters like Error or Nightmare! I'm willing to try Determination at this point even if it melts me! Everyone views me as weak! It's getting my whole family into trouble!
  "
4124,"
   No of course not  you wouldn't have time to feed that ""brain"" of yours. *rolls eyes*  And I thought I came from  a stupid universe. You put those unwashed doormats to shame!! *he referring to his enemies  but  reaper wouldn't know that*

   Uhm your Error self is kinda always dying, the antivoid tried erasing you and well it didn't work but it messed you up bad

  Isn't that a made up story your son made? *Reaper is in pure denial, he doesn't want to believe it* The void is supposed to make you stronger! Just look at Error! Yeah it messed up his mind and put him through heII but he has more firepower and everyone knows not to f-ck with him just by looking at him..he looks that strong and has the magic to back it up..I guarantee Error hasn't had the same battles we faced..I need that same kind of power and intimidation..

4126,"
   I made Error a cellphone? Oh yeah I did do that didn't I. Why are you interested in the antivoid anyway,
  ","
  *Reaper facepalms* You really do forget everything.. well, not that you'll remember after I tell you..I'm planning on turning myself into a Error to gain more power..that way I can do a better job of protecting my family and everyone will start seeing me as a threat again.. problem is this plan could backfire...so in case it does, I'll need someone who can safely access the antivoid and a way to contact someone in the void..which is where you and Error come in

4127,"
   Well technically PJ and Gradient can get there, as can any other ones of Error's kids, and Geno can as well obviously, though it would end badly.
  ","
  ..Okay let me rephrase that, you and Error are the only ones I can get ahold of that can safely travel to and from the antivoid..I need you to make me a cellphone that works in the antivoid like the one you gave Error..so I can call you both if I need to
  "
4128,"
   Well the Error version of you is always dying just like Geno is now

  Thanks Ink..and no, I wasn't kicked out, I have something I need you and Error to help me with..I don't usually count on others but there's a chance my plan could backfire and your the only two who can access the antivoid if anything goes wrong..

4141,"
   *Geno just looks at him sadly, like he doesn't think Reaper will come back*

  *Oof**Reaper just clinks Genos cheek, from his sad look, he can tell what Genos thinking* Hey, I made a promise I would be back, us skeletons don't take promises lightly and you can call me if you need anything~

  ...Error could bail me out, right? It is his anti-void..he would have to run into me at some point..or..maybe..Error has his own custom cellphone Ink made him to talk through the void..he could make me one so I could call for help if I need it..I think..

  ","
  ...He is? Damn it.. but I bet if I became a Error I could defeat him..and everyone would stop taking me so lightly..being kind isn't supposed to make everyone see me as weak..*Reaper huffed* According to Blueprint..my Error self got turned into one when his Geno went missing..he ended up trapped in the antivoid looking for his Geno.. my Geno isn't missing and is still here with me..so it shouldn't turn out the same when I head directly there myself..I should be more powerful when I become one..Genos far stronger when he's Fatal Error..it should go the same way for me..

   ... sorry just started thinking, which timeline's standards do we raise our kids by... I mean I don't think Raven or Shino will be able to stay in this timeline once they're grown...
  ","
  *Reaper rubs his skull* They could..but they would have to be assigned a different job..they couldn't be Gods of Death since they're mortal..Asriel was the God of Hope before he..well..died anyway speaking of jobs..Asgore was thinking of giving you a title since you live here with us, what do you think?
  "
4202,"
   Paps knows what sex is?? *he sounds kinda stunned*
  ","
  Well.. uh..he knows what all the swear words are..so it's not that big of a stretch he might know about that too...*Reaper sweats a bit* you okay Love?
  "
4203,"
   of course if you slept around you could just erase Geno's memory if he ever found out
  ","
  He has determination anon, not all the memories I erase stay erased.. besides don't think either one of us would be okay with the other seeing someone else..I got p-ssed over you guys wanting him with Ganz..I let you have it your way and stuck him over there and it didn't work out..even if it had, I would of kiIIed the guy..*Reaper huffed*

4204,"

  ","
  Geno?? *Reaper gently shakes him* H-hey, Love, are you okay?
  "
4205,"
   Where I'm from multiple spouses is frowned on, as for teaching kids about sex? hell I wouldn't even let Paps learn anything about that...
  ","
  I know and I know you wouldn't be okay with having more husbands which is good for me, all I need is you *Reaper then nuzzles Geno* and..I'd be p-ssed if I saw you with someone else..
  
  The Paps here is a bit different..he might know about it...*And might be grossed out*
  "
4206,"
   You really need to Stop doing that. They're all still kids, Goth is the eldest and is barely a teenager, they are too young for you to go telling them anything about that least of all our personal sex life. I swear
  ","
  Gaster told me about everything when I was Shinos age..*Reaper nervously rubs the back of his skull* Guess I was just raised different? Hell here in ReaperTale it's okay to have multiple wives and husbands..Life was with both Asgore and Gaster at the same..

4207,"
   You better not have really chased them out!
  ","
  Well, it was more like they overheard what I said..I sorta screamed out the window that me and you made love..which made them all leave the house, but it works, now we have the whole house to ourselves~

4208,"
   Don't make comments like that where the kids could overhear you *tsun is red*

  Don't worry, I chased them all out of the house by now, it's just Death with a cute strawberry angel~ I should let you know, your strawberry side is showing~

4209,"
   Please don't, you'd be dead weight if you did

  Pfft *That got him to laugh* Aw but you make such a nice bed~ In more ways than one~

4210,"
   fair enough

  But I'm YOUR goofball *Reaper says before wrapping his arms around Geno*
  "
4212,"
   Knew you'd say that

  Well technically I didn't actually say anything..just showed a adorable picture of my angel~ *Reaper winks*

   We are not talking about this and I've told you before how upset it makes me that you'd discuss our sex life with other people!

  Okay okay, sorry Love~ *Reaper just clinks Geno on the cheek* I'll go get my robe and work on not talking about it..even though it was really cute~ *he then heads off to change into his robe*

   Oh jeez, Reaper go put your robe on and I'll calm down Sorell

  Aw but I thought you liked seeing me like this~ At least that's what showed me last night~*Omg--*

  Shouldn't you be married by now? How old are you? 20? And your calling for you mommy?

  Looks like you fell head over heels for you daddy huh? Get it? Cause I'm wearing heels--*Mod facepalms* Don't you have a little boyfriend too? Maybe I should tell you how to make babies~

4219,"
   AAAAAHHH!!!! *Raven covers his skull where his ears would be and darts out of the house entirely so he isn't able to hear his dad* STOP IT!!! I don't wanna hear about you and mom doing--THAT! OR ME AND BLUEPRINT! QUIT IT!!

  *Reaper simply opens the kitchen window and shouts at poor Raven* YOU HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT IT SOMETIME SO YOU BRING HOME BABIES!! ME AND YOUR MOM WERE BABY MAKING LAST NIGHT! *omg--he just yelled that out the window--*

4220,"
   THIS IS WHY WERE NEVER AT HOME WITH YOU GUYS!! *Raven looks horribly embarrassed and p-ssed, storming out of the kitchen* STOP TALKING LIKE THAT!!

  Your gonna bone Blueprint one day and give us grandbabies~ Might as well learn how to do it now~ *REAPER STOP--*

  Because I boned your mom last night~ *REAPER*

  *Considering Reaper has traumatized them by wearing a dress in front of them before lol*  I don't think they'll mind~ I've done it before

4223,"
   I.. I guess not, but nothing bad happened. So we're good for the moment right?
  ","
  Yeah, can't believe it's actually been peaceful, well mostly peaceful anyway, we've actually had time to ourselves *Not to mention you haven't changed out of that dress yet--you look kind of silly weilding your scythe*

4224,"
   I went out to get Grillby's, you seemed to be having a good rest so I didn't disturb you. Jeez you look like you're about to drop dead of fright
  ","
  *That got a laugh out of Reaper* I wouldn't of minded if my angel decided to wake me~ But..with everything that's happened before..can you really blame me?
  "
4225,"
   Yeah? Uhm, why do you have your Scythe out?
  ","
  *Reaper sighs in relief and drops his scythe, immediately pulling Geno into a hug* I was worried..thought you might of been kidnapped or..

  Yeah he's right--huh?..*Reaper looks around rubbing his eye sockets, he noticed Geno wasn't beside him like he thought* Wait..where IS he..!?

   Are you allergic to anything?

  Not that I know of but look at how cute my Geno is~

   I... I don't know, it's not like you've threatened to do that to me. To suddenly have someone who looks like an old friend step out of the shadows and say she wants to eat my soul?

  I would eat your Soul in a different way, more like in the bedroom, with you wearing a maids dress, spanking me with a little feather duster--*STOP REAPER TMI*
  
  Okay okay I'll behave mod

   Hey you still laughed at the suffering of others back when we were first together, I didn't leave you then

  *Reaper smiled a bit* Okay, you got me there..even at the Christmas party, I remember someone calling me Deathly hot~
  
  But..how would you feel about me..if I did eat a Soul once..?
  
  *his smile softened into more of a saddened one and his eyelight had vanished from sight* you would fear me like Lady Death..right?

4246,"
   I'm not gonna sleep all day, but... even when you were trying to reap me I wasn't afraid of you, but something about
   
    @TheGoddess0fDeath

  She..would of..but you know nobody would of allowed that to happen Love, especially not me, if anyone touches you, they'll have Death to pay..

  But..if..you knew me from back before I met you..you might of been afraid.. ..before we met, I wasn't much different from Lady Death..
  
  I didn't turn Souls into apples and eat them but..don't think you would of stuck around with someone who laughed at others suffering..
  "
4247,"
   would Goth or Sorell have any interest in eating those apples I mean they are reapers too
  ","
  I ate those back before I met or even knew Geno..back then, I wasn't the same person you know now..
  
  I didn't care that they were made of Souls, didn't really care about anything but Gothy and Sorell are different from how I was, don't think they would eat those apples knowing what they're made of..
  
  *Yeah the Reaper Life knew was really dark, cold and heartless, you saw his story about birds, right? How he saw crows flock to eat a hanging human before he was even fully dead--he started to change a bit after spending some time with her but he didn't fully change until he met Geno, he was still a d0uche before then*
  "
4248,"
   I feel better... yesterday was.... holy hell
  ","
  *Reaper then scoops Geno up in his arms* Don't think about it, we don't need you sleeping all day again, kinda ruined the fun I had planned for us~ *he winks, he was joking around to hopefully put Geno in a better mood*

4249,"
   morning

  Morning Love~ *Reaper walks over and pulls Geno into a clink on the teeth* You look better

  ..Just be careful around our kiddos, I'm kinda surprised Genos taking this so well..*Reaper glances down at Geno who is currently hugging him* he usually isn't this friendly around humans..especially if they harmed one of us..
  "
4295,"
   Are you alright? It's not like you to lose control so badly, at least not that I can remember
  ","
  Your memory's not wrong..but I'll be fine Love..*Reaper just lays his skull on top of Genos* maybe we should get metal tables..
  "
4296,"
   Let just say I'm not a normal human.
  ","
  Yeah if picking people up with your mind didn't give it away *Reaper winks to let her know he's joking* but why would you come here?
  "
4297,"
   Shoot, you're really having trouble with your death touch
  ","
  Sorry about the mess Love..*Reaper pulls his hood down slightly* I'll get it though..along with the one in the kitchen..
  "
4298,"
   What is the most beautiful place in the world?
  ","
  Right next to my adorable bunny~
  "
4299,"
   Creepy!
  ","
  *Reaper then picks up a muffin though he seemed to be having trouble controlling his Death touch, the wood table they were sitting on gives way, breaking in half which makes the basket hit the floor* ..Yeeaah.. *he sweats a bit* if you value your life, I suggest you don't touch me.. what are you even doing here kiddo? You don't seem dead..
  "
4300,"
   Yes I'm sure
  ","
  *Reaper then pulls Geno into a hug although he was back to being silent*
  "
4301,"
   Reaper, I'm fine, it was just harmless flirting, you made sure I didn't get hurt. *Geno clinks his skull* we're fine
  ","
  *Reaper stares up at Geno in surprise with a blue blush going across his skull for a moment* ..Are you sure..?
  "
4302,"
   Reaper? Hey it's no big deal, not like anyone got hurt
  ","
  You almost did.. *Reaper darts his eyelight away from Genos* ..if I didn't try flirting with you in the kitchen.. ..
  "
4303,"
   Don't worry I turned the stove off, we can address the mess later.
  ","
  *Reaper fumbles a bit with the strings dangling off his robe before silently heading towards their couch*
  "
4304,"
   Probably a good thing she brought by muffins cause those pancakes aren't salvageable
  ","
  Sorry Love, i thought it would of been fun to make love in the kitchen but I almost burned you with the house..*Reaper sweats a bit*
  "
4305,"
   I mean you ARE scary..! At least I think you are even more now knowing you  rot stuff like weave baskets..  *lifts the basket up using her mind backing away as to not be near him *Can I just set these down inside? How's your umm significant other doing?The d3ad looking skeleton?
  ","
  Sure..we have a table..and his names Geno, besides a cooking disaster I think he's fine..I was bugging him while he was cooking and nearly got him and the etnire house burned down..
  
  Your lucky what happened to that basket didn't happen to you, part of being Death, you tend to kiII things..
  "
4306,"
   Eep thats scary!*holding the basket by it's sides now so not to drop the muffins* Guess you really are d3ath..!
  ","
  Tried to tell you that better you swung me around before..*Reaper sweats a bit* didn't think meeting the Grim Reaper wouldn't be scary.. normally that's how most people react when they see me..
  "
4307,"
   I um...Wanted to apologize for the first time we met..I didn't give off a good first  impression..*she has a muffin basket aw* I bought these I hope you aren't allergic to muffins.
  ","
  *Reaper then reached to pick up the basket though his Death touch made the handle rot and give way, he quickly pulled his hand back* Nice apology but doesn't seem like I can muffin it..  *he then looks to
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  * Hey, Love?
  "
4308,"
   *knocks on the door*
  ","
  Huh? *Reaper pauses when he heard a knock on their door and he sets
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  down so he can go open it* Who decided to knock on Deaths door this time? *Although when he opened the door he was pretty surprised* You again?
  "
4309,"
   s-shuddup
  ","
  Make me~ *Reaper winks before pausing as he heard a sudden knock at their door* Well that kiIIed the mood and surprisingly it wasn't cause of Death doing it..
  "
4310,"
   I'm not sick, just, you kinda had me pinned and it was pretty awkward
  ","
  *Reaper blushed a bit, finally realizing what hadhappened* Awkward? Or you thought I was hot?~ you were a strawberry Love~ you must of been the one with your mind in the gutter this time~
  "
4311,"
   can you just move please!
  ","
  Right forgot..*Reaper then moves up off Geno but he scoops his Tsundere up in his arms right after* I'm getting you to bed Love, I'll finish cooking in the kitchen for you
  
  *He mistook Genos blushing for him being sick*
  "
4312,"
   I don't see a gemstone.
  ","
  But he is a gem! Look how cute he is!
  "
4313,"
   Yeah I'm ok *he's red though* but do you think you could get up?
  ","
  Are you sure your okay Love? I haven't made any flirts yet and your already a strawberry.. *Reaper frowned a bit, he still doesn't see the position he put them in even though he is literally right on top of Geno*
  "
4314,"
   Whoa! *Geno was caught by surprise, he uses his psychokinesis to turn off the stove, but Reaper kinda has him awkwardly pinned*
  ","
  A-are you okay Love? Sorry..!
  
  *Reaper doesn't even notice the position he put them in yet*
  
  *If you have watched Inuyasha I feel like Geno and Reaper would be like Kagome and Inuyasha xD what I mean is Reaper and Inuyasha are both from ancient times and because of that they take almost everything modern as a threat to their Kagome/Geno so like say a beach ball was tossed to Geno, Reaper would likely pop it and burn it thinking it was a weapon lol like the pancake batter, it would definitely have hurt and burned but I don't think it would of killed him, Reaper went a tad overboard tackling him to the ground like it were a grenade*
  "
4315,"
   Reaper stop you're distracting me and *he accidentally drops the frying pan splashing hot batter on himself*
  ","
  *Actually when he saw the pan drop Reaper instinctively tackled Geno out of the way which probably didn't help any, the batter still splattered all over the floor though*
  "
4316,"
   *Geno shows Reaper how to make pancakes, enduring the flirting that ensues*
  ","
  You know what's sweeter than pancakes? You~ *Yeah Reaper is definitely not that focused on cooking you could swear he only wanted to learn how to cook just so he can have saxophone lessons with Geno in the kitchen xD*
  "
4317,"
   *Geno huffs and rolls his eye light, but he's smiling* Come on then
  ","
  *Reaper then gets up and happily follows after Geno* Time to fire up some cooking puns~ I've got plenty to cook with~ *wink* was it always hot in here or is it just you?~
  "
4318,"
   I can make breakfast, do you want that?
  ","
  You know, you said you would teach me how to cook a while ago..how about I tag along and we could have those cooking lessons?~ *Reaper gave a wink* You do know how to make a kitchen hot~
  "
4319,"
   You don't have to then, we can just stay like this *Geno is of course curious about Reaper's nightmare, but won't press the issue*
  ","
  *Reaper seemed a little relieved and let himself lay against his Tsundere*
  
  Thanks Love.. I just don't know how you'd take it..
  
  ..it hit me pretty hard..*he wipes his tears with the sleeves of his robe, Geno could probably bring it up later if he wanted to after they calmed down*
  
  ..y-you want me to make us breakfast..? Or..not really the best way to start our morning...
  "
4320,"
   Yeah, of course... did you have a nightmare?
  ","
  *Reaper nodded*...A really f-cked up one this time... not sure if I should tell you about it..
  
  *his eyelight darted away from Genos* ..
  "
4321,"
   *Geno walks over to the bed and sits next to Reaper giving him a concerned hug*
  ","
  *aw**Reaper hugged Geno back tightly as he laid his skull over his Tsunderes shoulder* T-thanks Love..can we stay like this..for a bit..?
  "
4322,"
   yeah, everything's fine.... are you sure you're fine?
  ","
  *Geno has joined the darkside with the anons lol*
  
  *Reaper then looked at Geno with more tears now streaming down his skull* G-Geno..can we hug?
  "
4323,"
   Reaper? hat's wrong? *Geno was sitting in the armchair reading, he woke up earlier but didn't want to disturb Reaper's sleep*
  ","
  *Reaper scanned the room frantically but he seemed to calm down a little when he spotted Geno in the chair*
  
  L-Love? Your..e-everything is okay..? *he pulled their bedsheets up to his skull*
  "
4324,"
   How is your family different from others?
  ","
  G-Geno..! *Reaper is finally awake although he has tears streaming down his eyes*
  "
4325,"
   What's your favorite pizza topping?
  ","
  *Reaper is still sound asleep, you might have to ask him later*
  "
4326,"
   *Palette brought over
   
    @TheBluePainter
   
   ’s apology note since Ink couldn’t remember to*
  ","
  *Only problem is, Reaper is dead asleep, he's been knocked out for a few days now*
  "
4327,"
   *I think Geno broke him XD*

  *Lol he did**After their time alone, Reaper was sound asleep next to his Tsundere*

   @DontcallmeSans
  
"
4329,"
   *hey every so often Geno surprises Reaper with this kind of thing... they probably need some time alone*
  ","
  *That's true, you should see how he behaves when Geno actually makes the first move xD it shocks the heII out of him*
  "
4330,"
   Ah of course well thanks I guess.*runs off *
  ","
  *Reaper won't interfere with them unless he believes they'll do harm to his family or if they bother someone close to Geno*
  "
4331,"
   Lock the door anyway, we don't need either our kids or random AU travelers walking in on us
  ","
  ..Wait..are you actually thinking what I'm thinking?~ *Reaper gets a very huge smirk on his skull now* I didn't know you were capable of thinking that way babe~ I'll lock the doors~ *he then walks over and locks their door*
  "
4332,"
   just look at her
  ","
  As long as they don't behave like their other versions, we won't have a problem...
  "
4333,"
   Life went back to her place right?
  ","
  Yeah so it's just you and me now~ *Reaper then nuzzles Geno* been a while hasn't it?~
  "
4334,"
   That's classified information second yes. She is  trouble!
  ","
  Well you kinda answered my question anyway.. and if you wanna know, I saw that alien go over there *Reaper points at
  
   @TheGoddessOfLife
  
  house*
  "
4335,"
   Yes the entire multiverse knows this by now
  ","
  Well that's a good thing, that way they know your mine and I LOVE YOU! *Reaper then pulls Geno into a hug* Mine!
  "
4336,"
   and this human is just a female Dib... so have fun
  ","
  ...Your joking...right?
  "
4337,"
   What teacher in school made the most impact on you and why?
  ","
  Never been to school but I'd say Geno makes a great teacher~
  "
4338,"
   Hey monster!Have you seen a green alien?*she approuches she's only slightly taller than miz*
  ","
  *Reaper is a bit surprised and would raise a eyebrow if he had any*
  
  First off..how did you get here? Did you come here with that alien?
  "
4339,"
   The new irken Miz is literally just female Zim. You've met him before he's Dib's enemy.
  ","
  Wait what? *Reaper looks completely dumbfounded, of all the things he could of heard, he didn't expect to hear Miz was a female version of Zim*
  "
4340,"
   well this was 'fun' to wake up to
  ","
  *Reaper chuckled a bit* Sorry about that Love, but we can still make it fun~
  "
4341,"
   What do you think it would be like to live life as a bird?
  ","
  So..I take it your a bird lover like someone else I know, huh kiddo? Looks like I'll be killing your little fantasy world~ Birds may look cute and fly free..
  
  But they're not, had to break the same news to my former friend
  "
4342,"
   Ha it didn't do anythin- *her pak starts to short circuit  she falls on then ground spasming  alot before going limp smoke coming from her pak rip*
  ","
  *Well that proved to her that he's the legit Grim Reaper*
  
  *Although Reaper being unfamiliar with these aliens, isn't sure what to make of the pak that's now smoking, he then picked up her lifeless body and set it outside their house*
  "
4343,"
   Not easily freaky skeleton. *giggles *
  ","
  Wanna bet? *Reaper then taps Miz*
  "
4344,"
   I'm not injured, or sick, or low on magic if that's what you're worrying about. I'm just tired.
  ","
  *Reaper is very relieved to hear that at least* You had me worried there Love..you can get some sleep.. I'll take care of this
  "
4345,"
   Reaper are you afraid of the blaster beasts?
  ","
  Guh--d-dont change the subject! *Reaper is visibly shaken with the beast near him though and backs up from it* D-Death doesn't fear anything..!
  "
4346,"
   No scythe, just use your Death touch
  ","
  *Reaper doesn't argue and unsummons his scythe, it would be understandable if Geno was still worried about him using his powers*
  
  Before I kiII this alien, mind telling me how your holding up first?
  "
4347,"
   I could use a bit more sleep, *Geno whistles and one of Gaster's Baster beasts trots in*
  ","
  That doesn't exactly answer my question..*Reaper gave a worried look though his worry was replaced with fear when he sees the beast trot in*
  "
4348,"
   Lies!!That is about as real as the Santa Claus
  ","
  Want me to prove it? *Reaper then summons his scythe to his hands* I could end you kiddo if you really want me to~
  "
4349,"
   I've already spoken with them, they'll listen to you, if reluctantly, just tell one what you want it to do. As for what's happening, you just got healed by Nova's fox spirit friend and I need more sleep
  ","
  ..*Reaper won't admit it but he's actually afraid of using the blaster beasts, he more than likely won't use them even if it were Genos*
  
  ...Are you okay Love? I know everything's been pretty hectic..
  "
4350,"
   Miz!haha!Idiots!
  ","
  I wouldn't be laughing at Death if I were you kiddo..ever heard of the Grim Reaper?
  "
4351,"
   You can tell my dad's blaster beasts to get rid of the pest, and maybe we should keep one in our room so we don't get more uninvited guests
  ","
  When did you get up? *Reaper is looking pretty confused though considering he just recovered from a concussion* ..Love..I've never dealt with blaster beasts before..and the fact they came from your Gaster..I don't think they'll listen to me.. I don't understand what's happening right now..
  "
4352,"
   Hehe!Stupid monster!
  ","
  Who the heII called our son stupid? *Reaper then peered down at the alien* Who the heII are you?

    @StylishIrken
   
   * AAHH!!!

4354,"
   Dad?? I know your awake! I just saw you! *Goth frowned and pulls his dads pillow off his skull*

  *Reaper just proceeds to hide his skull into
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  shoulder* ...5 more minutes...
  "
4355,"
   *Goth pops his skull back into his parents room this time to check on his dad since his mom is still asleep* Um...dad? Are you awake?
  ","
  *Reaper just pulls his pillow over his skull* ..
  "
4356,"
   I'm tired, and Goth's little episode didn't help
  ","
  *Reaper then scoots over a bit so he's right next to Geno and wraps a arm around him* Let's sleep then..nobody will...bother us..and Gothy..you know how he is..having kiddos is..exhausting..but we got it handled..
  "
4357,"
   I think you're Lucid enough to sleep safely... *he helps Reaper to bed* *but when Geno flops in bed he just buries his face in his pillow*
  ","
  T-thanks Love..but..you okay?
  "
4358,"
   Well now my head aches too... dammit Gothy, was he trying to make things worse
  ","
  *Goth just doesn't take much seriously, when Geno was sick he was calling his dad and grandpa both b-tches*
  
  *Reaper tugs a bit on Genos hoodie* dont..worry about ..it.. we should..both rest..

4359,"
   *Geno shoos

   from the room* He's joking, making a bad joke

*GOTH! WTF*

4361,"
   I need to know you're alright before I can let you nap
  ","
  ..I..I think..? I'll be okay..*Reaper then drapes his arms over Genos shoulders* might need help..getting up..though..

4362,"
   You feeling any better now?

4363,"
   Yeah, none of it was working

4364,"
   considering you were slurring your words moments ago, I think I'm worrying the right amount
  ","
  *Reaper then nuzzles his skull into Geno* Don't remember that..but .. ...uh.. ..I forgot what I was saying.. think I was trying..to say something...to help you..not..worry so much..

4365,"
   good, I need you woken up a bit

   Ok in a human a concussion is bleeding inside the skull putting pressure on the brain, not sure how that translates for us skeletons, but just keep talking to me ok?

  Ghnn...G-Geno...*Reaper then held his hand out to reach for his Tsundere*

  Sh-t I forgot..*Reaper then summons his scythe though that causes him to fall which proves Genos point, he isn't ready to start reaping yet* we might have to cancel the da-aaAh!?

4398,"
   No, mostly cause I don't trust leaving our kids at home alone right now. We don't need to come home to chaos
  ","
  Well, we have a few options..2 of them I wasn't really planning on..but we could just leave them with my bro..or we could either take them with on the date or just have the date at home..
  "
4399,"
   Yes, I am actually. I'm annoyed with our kids but that's something that I can't deal with right now
  ","
  *Reaper chuckled a bit* Yeah they're a handful..but you still love them..most the time
  
  So..since we're doing better, how do you feel about a date?
  "
4400,"
   Well one of us needs to worry about your health and since you won't it falls on me
  ","
  *Reaper shakes his skull* I could say the same for you Love, you don't exactly worry about yourself either, are you even okay after everything?
  "
4401,"
   I mean that's the nice thing about reaper tale we are mostly  safe everything is well d3ad. Apparently you're the only person who can hurt me .
  ","
  If your really dead then not only me but our family can hurt you if they wanted to, Geno is in limbo so he can interact with the dead just like I can and our kiddos..I don't think need explaining.. if I had to guess, I'd think a cat got you, it's how most mice end up here anyway
  "
4402,"
   I mean i lived in reapertale for ages now..I can't remember life outside of it....And I doubt a family of mice could be born in someplace so DARK. Maybe I should go get help.. I'm not strong enough!

   @DontcallmeSans
  
  saw Milo trying to help Reaper and helped the God up shortly after*
  
  I think you and your family might be dead then kiddo, not sure exactly how you died though, my bro is the one who reaps the Souls of the innocent.. so if anyone might know what got you, he might..but if it happened a long time ago he might not remember it..
  
  Thanks for at least trying to help anyway.. not really sure why you wanted to.. Death isn't exactly someone you would want to help, can't tell you how many times we've been attacked ..

   Are you okay?
  ","
  I-I'll be fine..*Reaper frowned* but I don't know what to do about this..*he motions to the IV still flopped on top of him, he can't exactly get up with it like that*..Not that a mouse would be able to help.. actually..why aren't you running away from me or screaming?

  ","
  L-Love.. you saw it too? *Reaper let's out a sigh* That's why I don't believe it is because it was shown by a kid, being a Error should make you more powerful not the opposite!

  ","
  *You just lost anon privileges, none of you anons are able to harm the AfterDeath fam now, because honestly, this is getting ridiculous.. don't get me wrong, I don't mind conflict in rps I don't mind battles but when you have so many fights that it really does render your characters crippled, I have to draw a line somewhere
  
  Reaper is a very powerful character, yes, but if he is fighting day after day after day he is eventually going to weaken, I can't just make him OP asf to where he's unbeatable and never gets tired or injured that's unrealistic and makes it not fair to anyone who wants to fight him, that means each time they fight they know their character will be insta-kiIIed and can't do sh-t to get out of the fight, their character would just be f-cked each time they interact with Reaper and it would put them in the same situation I'm facing where they can't even rp, I usually just roll with whatever cause it's just a rp and it shouldn't matter what goes on in a fake make believe world like if you wanted it to rain kittens I really wouldnt care and would just roll with it cause it's not like I'll actually go outside irl and see cats raining from the skies, it won't actually affect ""me"" or you but it's not fair to make a fight impossible or to render a character helpless by throwing things at them everyday, this is solely directed at you anons whoever you may be following our accounts, it's nice you like our characters and that you want to interact with them but don't keep throwing problems their way, it's okay if you give them some problems but what I'm trying to say is don't add more problems on top of existing ones

  You live behind her toys? I'll give you credit kiddo, that's a pretty smart.. *Reaper staggered a bit but he knelt down and moved the plushies aside to spot where the mouse had gone and sees the hole in the wall, since he can't actually go in, he carefully lays himself on the ground so he can at least peer into the hole*

   Whoa you’re not leaving if you’re hobbling around with your scythe, why don’t you lie down with me awhile?

   Okay follow  me!*he grabs his old clothing heading towards shino's room.*

  Pfft, well, you still can't take that off kiddo or you'll end up on my Death list... *Reaper then pauses when Milo asked him if he wanted to see his home* you are technically living in our house..so it would be nice to know exactly where you are in our house..

4522,"
   so you won't talk to him, but you won't let anyone else near him either? Isolation like that doesn't seem healthy

  ..I really don't know what to do here..

  If I refused which I used to fight tooth and nail against it, Gaster would royally kick my @$$
  
  ..I never wanted any of this..having the title of God of Death..I have all these expectations people expect me to live up to..I have to always act and behave a certain way so people don't take me lightly.. it would make the job a lot harder if everyone thought I was just some pushover and picked fights with me each time I showed up thinking they could cheat Death and escape it rather than just accepting their fate..Don't get me wrong I've still had people tell me off when their time was up but they usually back down and let me reap them cause they fear me and don't think they stand a chance against me..
  
  It's tiring always having to be this terrifying monster that everyone fears and hates.. but that's part of the job..if everyone was my best friend they would feel betrayed when the time came to reap them..and it wouldn't really be easy on my end TO reap them..

  Huh..that's..actually pretty smart, you take photos of yourself and get paid for it,  that has to be the easiest job on earth

  ","
  Well, you haven't got on my bad side kiddo but what is it you wanna share? I wouldn't mind sharing coffee *Reaper chuckled a bit*
  "
4734,"
   Well I have this  spider sense it warns me of danger and super strength. I also shoot webs but they aren't natural. *webs the wall*

  I'm guessing that's why you call yourself Spiderman?
  
  If that's what you do to the wall in afraid to know how you browse the web *wink*

   I fight crime and  villains I'm one of new York hero's. Pretty much a avenger.

  But your a human..right? At least that's what Gothy here told me.. kinda weird to think there's a human out there trying to stop villains
  
  Do you even have powers? Besides sticking to walls?

   Anti hero?
  ","
  Guess you could say that..I am the literal Grim Reaper, my job is to take away the Souls of anyone who's time is up and if they don't go peacefully, I end up reaping them..
  
  Wouldn't call that pure evil or pure good..
  
  So..what's the deal with you? Gothy said your some kind of hero?

   With that magic suppressor you can't go using your magic recklessly and since  we're in the doodlesphere no one can reach us *assuming Goth doesn't bring guests*

You both stayed together cause you really love eachother? It's not cause your crazy and he's scared of you? I see him hit you a lot though ..

  You won't hear me say this a lot but..thanks Asgore.. ..it's not any injuries.. giving me trouble though.. I used a..bit too much.. magic.. I know I shouldn't of but.. I was...pretty worried about.. my family..

  *Howver Reaper still seemed unresponsive, he would of been just fine and right at Genos side taking care of his Tsundere if he didn't waste his magic on IVs, didn't use his hourglass, or previously shared magic with Geno instead of using the IVs he just filled back up, those decisions came back and bit him in the @$$ add on he knew his magic was low and continued to use it to teleport, summon his scythe, send people to literal heII, ect, he's just made very poor decisions*

   Hey!! Wake up! This isn't the time to be taking a dirt nap! Mom needs you, you jerk!! *Goth huffed as he yelled at his dad* You can be lazy some other day!

  *Though Reaper didn't respond, this might be a wakeup call for the kiddos seeing for themselves that Reaper isn't this unstoppable almighty invincible God that he claims to be, the Gods in ReaperTale are some of the strongest monsters in this entire multiverse but they don't surpass monsters like Nightmare or Error or Ink and can be brought down, Nightmare can just about kill anybody tbh he's OP asf*

  His favorite thing is Grillbys, he's a lot like your dad..which means you really shouldn't be rude to him..*Reaper gives a slight glare*

   Yeah okay! Im sorry.. Just let me out. We can go get lunch together or something.
  ","
  *Reaper sighs and let's Torn free to go since the kiddo actually apologized and offered lunch which he still hadn't accomplished* ..
  
  ..Okay, you got yourself a deal..I was on my way to bring back lunch for Geno...when I fell here..and haven't been able to get myself back up..so..if you brought him back something for me, that would let you off the hook..

  Okay okay, I won't do that anymore, unless it's someone like Torn who deserves it

  Thanks Love~ *Reaper then closes his eye sockets, enjoying laying in Genos lap* Hey, I've always said my job can be a real kiIIer

  Don't worry, I'll go get him after a little bit..

   Like I said Fluffy is keeping him from leaving, but I'll come with you... unless do you need to be carried *he gets a smirk*

5108,"

  I don't think I heard you.. you wanna run that by me again?

   Reaper, the kid doesn't know anything about you, anons said he could get you to back down by making fun you. Are you really gonna let those anons be right?

5111,"
   I'd hug you but one of my hands is kinda cuffed to the bed, the Reaper I know wouldn't let some kid disrespect him like that though

   Hmpt.*pouts*

  What's the matter? Death caught your tongue kiddo? *Reaper chuckled* Be lucky I didn't decide to reap you, can't say you won't still get a punishment worse than Death from your parents though~

5118,"
   Maybe, fine I'll spend the day in bed, happy? All I ask is you make sure none of our kids have gotten in trouble, and I mean actually checking on them not just texting.

  Well..nothing else seemed to get you to stay put so--h-hey! *Reaper seemed a bit panicked when Geno tried using his cuffed hand* Don't use that one!

   well considering I passed out I don't think you had to worry about that

  "
5121,"
   *Geno lightly thumps Reaper's skull* don't you dare threaten to hurt yourself to make me stay in bed. *he gives him a cold look, but there is also fear reflected in it... someone is still haunted by what Reaper did while drunk*

  *Aw the poor guy** Reaper was a bit surprised not just from Geno thumping his skull but the look he got from him, he could tell it wasn't all anger*
  
  I--okay..it wasn't one of my better ideas..but.. I was scared Love.. I didnt want you doing anything to hurt yourself..
  "
5122,"
   Thanks *Geno just leans against him* sorry thinking about those nightmares always leaves me unsettled. *Don't worry he's ok to be awake, while he was out cold for basically a full day I left him on IVs so his magic recovered fully. You're both ok... let's make it last more than 5 minutes*
  ","
  *Reaper seemed a bit relieved when Geno leaned against him and he just holds him close*
  
  Hey, I don't mind if you need to cuddle to get settled~
  
  ..but..I really don't think you should be up right now..
  
  I was that scared for you the other day..I threatened to hurt myself if you left bed..you passed out before hearing it but..
  
  Just..don't get up..please?
  
  *Reaper heard you but he is still worried about Geno, it didn't seem like he believed you*
  "
5123,"
   ... *he looks down* yeah, in them everyone thinks I dusted, or vanished or something, I try and tell you guys I'm right there but I just go through you and no one hears or sees me

  Love..I-- it's okay Love, those are just nightmares, your right here with me and you'll always be here with me..

   .... Hello earth to Reaper, did you not hear me or something? Or is this one of those nightmares where no one can see me again
  ","
  S-sorry Love, I just..I didn't mean--wait you have nightmares about nobody being able to see you?
  
  *Reaper then looks back at Geno, worry clear in his lone eye*
  "
5125,"
   Does your name have a meaning? What is it?
  ","
  My name doesn't speak for itself? Even if you didn't catch that, my robes, giant scythe and the fact that I'm a skeleton, should have, I'm DEATH, my name gives away it's meaning, I reap Souls and kiII everything I touch, should of been pretty obvious
  "
5126,"
   Reaper? What happened I just blacked out last night
  ","
  ..*Reaper was unsure what to say or do since that incident was done by the mod, honestly he's at a total loss for words and is unsure if Geno should even be awake right now, he was happy to see him up but now he's unsure if he should be happy about it*.. *he just stays seated at the edge of their bed looking completely lost*
  "
5127,"
   Oh yeah?Dad is twice the skeleton  you are!
  ","
  Funny when I'm technically a version of him
  
  I'd say there was 3 times the skeletons right now
  
  *Reaper just smiles, unless this kiddo personally insults him or Geno, he won't get very far lol*

5128,"
   *I dunno why I'm knocking on your door honestly... I think I was doorframed.
  ","
  Pfft, quit trying to make me laugh, Death isn't supposed to be funny *Reaper chuckled a bit* There's a reason why I'm called the Grim Reaper, anyway you want your kiddo back or..?
  "
5129,"
   My dad is pretty relaxed.Its mom who's the problem.But who knows maybe he will.At least he won't let you hurt me.
  ","
  I wonder what your mom would think if she knew you were insulting your dad and other skeletons? She sure would be disappointed huh?
  
  *Reaper gives a slight glare*
  
  Kiddo, for the record, if I wanted to hurt you, I would of done it already..your dad wouldn't be a match for me either..I'm the literal Grim Reaper, you can't stop Death
  "
5130,"
   I was born on the surface...But I guess you have a point.
  ","
  Well, your parents sure weren't, Frisk didn't have to help them get free and Genos Frisk could of just left him forever trapped in the Save screen, kinda shows some humans aren't as bad as the others, I don't fully trust my own Frisk but they've gotten Chara off our backs a couple times
  "
5131,"
   He's  here to protect me duh!
  ","
  So that's the version of Sans that's your dad huh? He might just be here to ground you kiddo, don't think he's here to save you just yet
  "
5132,"
   *I remember the last thing Gaster said to me before he kicked the bucket... He said: ""Hey how far do you think I can kick this bucket?""
  ","
  Pfft, besides the God awful puns, what brings you knocking on Deaths door?
  "
5133,"
   Maybe I was outta  line but I'm not wrong.The humans aren't to be trusted they'll just trap us again or worse.The genocide route will  just happen again on the surface.Is that what you want?What am I kidding you're d3ath!Not my dad!I doubt you'd care if monsters were gone  you God's are untouchable.
  ","
  ...*Reaper just sighs and sets Torn down* Look kiddo, I don't like humans either but not all of them are out to get you, yours took you to the surface didn't they? They gave you your happy ending, Genos Frisk had a change of heart and got him free from the Save screen so he forgave them for all they did, doesn't mean he fully trusts them but they did free him, they didn't have to help Geno and could of just left him trapped there..
  "
5134,"
   Why would you..?*he's afraid*
  ","
  *I warned him Reaper isn't always the nicest lol*
  
  Give me a reason why I wouldn't, you were the one that decided to disrespect your parents kiddo, Geno on the other hand IS actually a version of your dad, before the human decided to go on a complete kiIIing spree, he wasn't any different from your dad..
  
  He's what would happen if the human in your timeline ever decided to end you all permanently..

  Don't sound so Grim, I thought that was my job! *Reaper winks to try and cheer up the little Ink demon*

  Technically I COULD be another version of your dad..I was with my Toriel for a while..*Reaper gives the kid a glare right back* her name here is Life, here is where all Gods and Goddesses reside to keep the multiverse in balance..me and Life are the ones in charge of who lives and dies in the multiverse..
  
  In case you didn't know, my name is Reaper Sans, the God of Death, the literal Grim Reaper..I could take you right out of this multiverse if I wanted..

  *I can't argue with that lol*
  
  Touche, well with my schedule I'm pretty forgetful myself, comes with being the literal Grim Reaper, so how've you been kiddo?

5138,"
   I have a better idea... Lock him in a room with X-Chara

  Pfft, that might be TOO much t0rture for the kid! *Reaper just chuckles, also..I don't think he's ever met Bendy*

   called Geno an idiot

   Hence why I got rid of all the bleach in Reapertale... *Geno suddenly hugs Reaper tightly* please don't do that again
  ","
  You did? *Reaper was surprised by the sudden hug and it took him a few minutes before he slowly hugged Geno back tightly*
  
  ..I won't .. I promise..you just need to stay in bed..at least until I get all the bleach out of my system..
  "
5257,"
   What?!!?
  ","
  *Reaper sweats a bit and nervously tries calming Geno*
  
  C-calm down Love, just as long as I know your here, in bed, safe and sound everything will be fine! I did drink a lot of bleach..
  "
5258,"
   I just wanted to talk to Paps a a bit...
  ","
  Your not leaving this bed, if you wanna talk to Paps I can ask him to come to you instead..he would understand that your not ready to be up yet..
  
  Besides I..I'm not entirely in my right mind yet..
  
  *Reaper hesitated as he wasn't sure he should of pulled that card but he really doesn't want Geno getting out of bed after using that dragon*
  "
5259,"
   Well they gave me one too
  ","
  *Reaper then scoops Geno up in his arms and places him right back in bed* What part of stay in bed didn't you get?
  "
5260,"
   *hands you the card* Yes go make the world full of Chaos!
  ","
  Didn't think you'd actually give Death a card..or tell me to go cause chaos..
  
  But I think there's been enough excitement lately so I'm not using this yet
  
  Thanks anyway
  
  *I hope he never uses it..this was a very bad decision to give that to Reaper*
  "
5261,"
   I hope not, as part of his punishment Goth is supposed to be looking after his siblings but he's still just a kid too, they need someone who can actually take care of them
  ","
  I have one way to take care of them *Reaper points at his scythe--seriously!?*
  "
5262,"
   *Geno's also still recovering from using the Blaster Dragon, though he won't bring that up* Think your bro would be willing to look after the kids for a bit while we get our footing back?
  ","
  *Reaper knows, he hooked a IV up to Geno just to be safe and he's going to do his best to keep Geno in bed for a while even if it means resorting to some pretty dirty and underhanded tricks*
  
  I don't think he'll mind~
  "
5263,"
   What crime would you commit if you had a ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" card?
  ","
  All of them
  
  *What?*
  
  Can I have that card now?
  "
5264,"
   Just tired, but I swear I'm always tired lately
  ","
  *Reaper just sighs as he lays his skull against Geno* Yeah I know what you mean..I've been dead tired too lately..I think we've just run ourselves into the ground.. but everything is back to normal for now so we have time to dig ourselves out of the ground
  "
5265,"
   Yeah fine, I don't feel up for doing much else anyway
  ","
  *Reaper then sits up on the bed and latches onto Genos arm, hugging him close* ..You okay Love?
  "
5266,"
   I think it's just that your stressed. I know my memory gets spotty when I'm stressed
  ","
  That's..a little different..can we spend the day cuddling? *Reaper looks up at Geno giving a saddened expression* I need you with me..
  "
5267,"
   just a thought but couldn't Cross and his brat alter Geno's code taking him out of Limbo? ... wait nevermind anytime they try messing with his code he ends up as Fatal_Error so guess not
  ","
  ..I should reap you just for suggesting it..
  
  Know what, I think I will! *Reaper then swings his scythe at the anon, reaping them on the spot*
  "
5268,"
   How do you deal with the lame haters?
  ","
  Simple, kiII them
  
  *seriously?*
  "
5269,"
   *Geno used the life flower on Reaper's wings when the god flopped*

  Huh..? Oh, thanks Love~ I'm starting to think Inks memory problems are contagious..
  "
5270,"
   Yeah we have haven't we...
  ","
  *Reaper then flops face down in their bed, completely forgetting to use a Life flower, so his wings are still out* At least now it's more peaceful..for us anyway.. I'm really tired..
  "
5271,"
   I think there are a few left in the closet
  ","
  I got it *Reaper then opens their closet, ignoring the mountain of Geno plushies inside lol and grabs what Life flowers they had left, handing them to Geno*
  
  It's better if you hold onto them, in case anything happens
  
  We've had to use a lot of these lately..*he frowned slightly as he thought about it*..
  "
5272,"
   Well what should we do about that then
  ","
  Maybe nurse Geno could help?~ *Reaper winks* you have any Life flowers left?
  "
5273,"
   Not while your brother is in our house Reaper, imagine if Paps walked in on.... *Geno just shakes his head*
  ","
  I know, I know.. besides *Reaper points back at his wings* we can't have our fun until I get these fixed, I can't unsummon them when they're damaged..

5274,"
   You're in the gutter, I'm standing here shaking my head *he has a smile on his face though*
  ","
  I could take you in the gutter with me so we can make it dirty~
  
  *he winks and gives a bright smile, he's honestly happy to see Geno seemed happy now too*
  "
5275,"
   And this went right into the gutter. Of course. Do I even wanna know all the details about what happened with your Papyrus
  ","
  ..Probably not, but you can't tell me to clean the gutters now when we're already in there~
  "
5276,"
   Best pick up line you've heard?
  ","
  I thought this one was to die for, Geno didn't appreciate it though~
  "
5277,"
   I'm.... my glitches hurt trying to wrap my head around this
  ","
  Sorry Love *Reaper then walks over to Geno and clinks his glitches* Does that make it better? I could wrap your head around something else..~
  "
5278,"
   Wait you had to rescue, what?! *Geno is very confused... I don't blame him*
  ","
  It's a long story.. Undyne attacked him thinking he was still being possessed, I got in the way to protect him, we both were sent flying through a wall..I teleported us back here..and now I'm dead tired..
  
  Good news is everything is back to normal, for now anyway.. until Undyne comes back at me for throwing my scythe at her..and for flinging her..
  "
5279,"
   What the hell happened to you?!
  ","
  Huh? Oh, morning Love, sorry I was kinda distracted..
  
  I'm fine, just had a brief run in with Undyne.. had to rescue Painless from her
  "
5280,"
   fuck, I'm gonna have to go look for him
  ","
  *Or maybe not, Reaper returns after a long while though his wings are out and are visibly tattered with black feathers falling off as he walked through their bedroom door*
  
  *It's been a pretty strange morning for Geno*
  "
5281,"
   *Well now Geno's worried, he sends Reaper a text* -where'd you go?-
  ","
  *Yet there was no reply from the God..*
  "
5282,"
   Hope he doesn't set the oven on fire... again *Geno sits on their bed eating the Grillby's Reaper got him*
  ","
  *Aw**Though oddly by the time he's done eating, Reaper is still nowhere to be seen*
  "
5283,"
   Reaper *Geno gets up and is surprised to find there's an IV in his soul, he as asleep when Reaper set it up* what the- I don't remember needing this
  ","
  *There's also a bag of Grillbys with a note attached sitting on their nightstand*
  
  *The note if Geno chooses to read it, says*
  
  ""Just in case my home cooking doesn't work out I had a backup plan, you can eat this now if I'm taking too long in the kitchen
  
  Love you
  
  -Reaper your love muffin""

5284,"
   *Geno's finally up, he's very confused to find Reaper wasn't by their bed, he figured the God was going to be hovering over him* Huh?
  ","
  *It was a bit odd, he left to go make Geno breakfast but something else had come up so he's no longer in the house*
  "
5285,"
   Somewhat.Yeah ^^
  ","
  Can you take this over? I have to go somewhere *Reaper then leaves the cooking to Pres and rushes off in a hurry, that was odd..*

  *2 Gods of Death trying to make pancakes, this will end well lol*
  
  You know how to cook?? *he hands her the frying pan he had in his hand*

5287,"
   *hopefully not burning the house down*

5288,"
   Bored! Me and orphy are just visiting.  :3
  ","
  *Reaper is a bit embarrassed since he's currently in the kitchen with a red apron on and holding a frying pan lol*
  
  Uh.. don't tell anyone about this...

5289,"
   *considering the excitement Geno's fairly deeply asleep, Reaper could leave if he wanted to....*

  *Reaper is too worried about him to leave right now, instead, the God tries fixing him breakfast without burning the house down*
  "
5290,"
   *having some internet trouble* Geno just dozes off, he's actually doing pretty well this time, not nearly as much magic backlash, perhaps he's getting better control*
  ","
  *It happens c:**Reaper was still concerned so he hooks up a IV to Geno just to be safe as soon as he saw him doze off then gets back into bed after he treats his own minor injuries from the few minutes he spent as a blaster beasts chew toy*

5291,"
   then don't try leaving me behind again

  Love.. sometimes it's not that simple..

5292,"
   I just need the reassurance you're really ok

  *Reaper then lays his skull on top of Genos with his arms wrapped around him*
  
  ..Geno.. I'll be okay when you are.. ..don't do that again.. you hear me?
  "
5293,"
   Can we cuddle in bed? that would help *yeah he's tired*
  ","
  *Reaper then teleports them both home ontop of their bed, the fact Geno actually asked to cuddle instead of answering him, has him worried*..
  
  Since when are you the cuddling type?

5294,"
   *Geno slides to the ground* I wanted to make sure you didn't get hurt. *Geno just gives him a tired smile, he was worried about Reaper too*

  *Reaper then gently pulls Geno onto his lap which honestly causes the God to blush since he's never been the one doing that* ...Love..the point of you staying home was so you didn't get hurt either.. you needed break..
  
  Are..you ..even okay after...? *he gave Geno a worried look*
  "
5295,"
   *Geno could tell Reaper needed him and had teleported to his side, though he used his Blaster Dragon, so Reaper will need to look after him for awhile* H-Hey, you look like death
  ","
  S-speak for yourself..*Reaper then pushes himself up so he's sitting up on the ground*... Love.. as I happy as I am to see you.. I have to ask.. why did you do that..!? I know I was in trouble but..you didn't need to use your dragon! You know how hard that is on you!

  Not to mention I told you to stay home!

  Oof..! *Reaper winces as he were dropped to the ground though he wasn't expecting Geno to actually appear or use the blaster dragon*

5297,"
   I'm your friend~But d3ath can't eat d3ath.Right?
  ","
  I heard of a dog eats dog kind of world but not a Death beats Death kind *Reaper chuckled a bit* what brings you to this side of the Underworld?
  "
5298,"
   If you and three friends were on a deserted island, who would be eaten first?
  ","
  To think everyone calls me sadistic,
  
  Well, sorry to tell you, but I have no friends so nobody would be eaten and trying to eat Death, that's a one way ticket to the Underworld
  
  *Reaper then pauses as he remembers Horror had actually almost ate him before*
  
  .... ...
  "
5299,"
   *Geno does read it, he's still p!ssed though*

  *At least it's better than handcuffing him to the bed lol*

5300,"
   WHAT!?
  ","
  *Oof**Reaper had taken off and left Geno behind while he searches for Painless, there was a note left on the ground however if Geno chooses to read it, which reads*

  *You might want to remove the IV before you try taking off*
  "
5303,"
   You're not going off on your own Reaper
  ","
  *Reaper pauses as he looks back at Geno, he seemed surprised*
  "
5304,"
   *I'm not sure, killer generated his own hatred if Geno was infected from an outside source... it might just leave him weak and sick, I'm not sure* I suppose e won't know until we track down Paps

  *At least that's better than ending up like KiIIer or controlled**Reaper then gets up and summons his scythe*
  
  You sure your up for going after him? You can stay here Love.. you need the rest
  
  *I don't think Geno would be okay with letting you go alone after almost losing you..not to mention you still have that neck injury and a IV hooked to you*
  "
5305,"
   Okay!^^ *comes over to him* Its okay I'm not mad you k!lled me last time you didnt mean  to!*sits  by him*
  ","
  Your not? Huh..most people would hold a grudge..your really different kiddo..
  
  *Reaper pets her head, making sure he doesn't slip up and accidentally kiII her again, that would be horrible*
  
  I might not mean to but my powers make it kind of dangerous to touch me all the time, so try not to hug me so much, okay?
  
  Unless you really want a early grave but I thought your plan was to avoid becoming extinct?
  "
5306,"
   Do you know for sure your brother has Hatred, could it be some other form of mental manipulation *Hatred and DT usually don't mix well, but let's keep that quiet*
  ","
  ..No but..I didn't think she was capable of controlling people a different way..
  
  *Oof Geno would end up like kiIIer wouldn't he?*

5307,"
   You don't need to continue. *Geno pulls him into a hug* Your Chara isn't getting to me
  ","
  I-I really hope that doesn't happen Love.. ..Paps doesn't have the same willpower I had to fight back against her Hatred..and you.. with your Soul I--*he seemed pretty scared and grabbed onto Genos sleeve*
  
  ..I-I don't know if you could either..
  
  It wasn't easy to fight it off..there were times where I had no strength left to keep holding back the urge to reap everyone.. which..reminds me.. I still need to stop my brother before she makes him do the same thing..
  "
5308,"
   Im just worried about you two...! *aw *
  ","
  *Reaper was surprised by that answer and he can't help but motion for the little alien kiddo to sit next to him*
  
  Just try not to touch me often, we don't want you dying again like last time
  "
5309,"
   You had me do that before, but that's not relevant right now. Do you want to talk about your nightmare, or do you think it's better to just try and forget it
  ","
  Oh yeah, I did didn't I? I should probably have the picture in my robe somewhere--*Seriously?*
  
  ...*Though the God pauses when Geno asked about his nightmare*
  
  ...I don't know.. in my nightmare..you and Paps..both were possessed by Chara.. and I had to..fight..you both.. I couldn't get myself to fight back though..and.. ..well...
  "
5310,"
   Uh no... do you?
  ","
  Maybe...? *Reaper then blushed bright blue as his mind wandered off imagining Geno in a maid's dress*
  
  You looked so cute when I had that dream~ would you wear a maid's dress?~
  "
5311,"
   *knocks on the door* Are you okay reaper?

  *Aw**Reaper pokes his skull up when he hears Neo and he has one of his blue chains open the door for her* Yeah we're fine, what is it kiddo?

5312,"
   bad nightmare then I take it
  ","
  ..*Reaper just nods as he drapes a arm across Genos shoulder*
  
  ..I don't usually have nightmares like this.. ..did we switch dreams? You dream about us being dressed as maids?
  
  *Seriously?*

5313,"
   Right here

  ..You really are right here.. that's a relief.. *he sighs and let's himself lay against his Tsundere*
  
  One heII of a way to start our morning though..
  "
5314,"
   *Reaper gripping at his hoodie woke him slightly, though hearing the god hyperventilate shook him fully awake* Geno rests his hands on Reaper's shoulders* Calm down, you're having a nightmare, everything's alright I'm right here *he rests his skull against Reaper's as he speaks*
  ","
  *Aw**That seemed to work, his breathing was calming down a bit and his grip on Genos hoodie had loosened*

  *:v You didn't have to translate the comic but that's kinda funny it's some crap Reaper came up with and just dragged Geno into it lol*

5316,"
   What TV show has gone off the air that you wish would come back?
  ","
  *Reaper is too deeply asleep to answer but now that I mention it, he seems to be having a nightmare, he was gripping part of Genos hoodie as his breathing sped up, he was almost hyperventilating*
  "
5317,"
   *Geno is a little surprised he reacted, but just lets Reaper hold him*
  ","
  *Aw**Reaper must of been really worn out, he didn't even get up when Geno had left bed or seemed to notice he had left at all and only reacted when Geno had gotten back into bed*
  
  *he gently pulls Geno close and hugs him while he slept*

5318,"
   man he's a sound sleeper... suppose I'm lucky he probably wouldn't have been happy about me checking on the kids *Geno ends up curling back up in bed*

  *He sort of did, he did say afterwards they would have fun*
  
  What if I went back to how I used to be? I know you didn't know me back when I had no emotions at all..but I used to be similar to Ink when he goes off his paint..I wasn't capable of caring about anyone or anything back then.. not even Paps, my whole timeline could get destroyed and as long as it didn't affect me..I wouldn't care.. I think my emotions are getting in the way of everything.. if I lost them, I might be able to protect us better, I wouldn't go off trying to help Neo or anyone anymore
  
  *But you would stop caring about Geno and your children too...*

   *Geno actually lightly thumps Reaper's skull for those comments* Stop talking like that. Look things may be difficult but I'm happy this is where I ended up. I don't blame you for panicking about your brother, if it were my Paps I would have reacted the same way.

  I've been questioning a lot of choices I've made..

   This is real, you're awake. Guess someone was dead tired huh
  ","
  You can say that again..*Reaper then holds his robe right above where his Soul was* I thought it would shatter.. but I'm still here..so guess it didn't.. unless I'm dreaming and your not really here..
  
  everything's been really hard on both of us lately.. and most the time.. I find myself wondering if I did the right thing by putting you in limbo.. if I knew I practically sentenced you to life in HeII I ...I don't know if I would of gone through with it..
  
  ..It's been hard keeping my ""cool"" lately too.. before I met you, it was easy to ignore everything, people getting kiIIed didn't bother me, I could of cared less about what was happening to other people, I watched a entire timeline burn down and didn't care..I was just there to do my job..
  
  sometimes I wonder if it would of been better if I stayed that way.. not giving a damn about anybody..
  
  *Oof*
  
  Would of made it easier when I found out my bro was possessed, back then, it wouldn't have hit me as hard as it did now..I wasn't capable of caring then.. I might of had more of a clear head and figured out something to do instead of panicking.. I just wasted time and knocked myself out.. I wouldn't of freaked out about your nightmare either..

5341,"
   Yes, I'm sure. *though now Geno's worried about RT Papyrus as well*
  ","
  *Reaper then let's go of Geno and heads off*
  
  ..I-I'll be back love.. I can handle this..
  "
5342,"
   Look I'm touching you right now and nothing bad is happening, nothing bad will happen, but what's this about your bro?
  ","
  ..C-Chara..possessed him ..*Reaper sighed*..guess..I found out why he was still missing.. ..b-but... y-your sure I won't-- hurt you?
  "
5343,"
   *well now Geno is worried, he pulls Reaper into a hug* Hey it's ok, really
  ","
  I-I wanna believe that..I've been t-trying to convince us both that everything is okay..but..*Reaper then buries his tear filled skull into Genos chest as he held onto his hood* ..I'm scared Love.. ..! I-I'm scared to be hugging you right now..! I-I had a nightmare..that you..d-died..from my Death touch..it didn't matter that you were in limbo..I still..y-you still..then I find my bro..I--
  
  *Oof*
  "
5344,"
   Reaper, I can tell something is wrong... is... is this about my nightmare yesterday, I told you it's just a nightmare I don't think something like that would ever happen
  ","
  ..I-it's not that..*The God can't seem to help it and starts crying into his hands, he normally doesn't succumb to stress but..this time it seemed like he was the stressed out one* G-Geno..!
  "
5345,"

    @ReapertalePapyrus
   
   is under some serious psychic manipulation, be careful, even with my telepathy I can't get through whatever is effecting him
  ","
  *Problem is I have no idea if Reaper will be able to get through either..*
  
  *The God honestly seemed afraid and kept silent, his empty sockets showing all that needs to be said..*
  
  ... ..
  "
5346,"
   what....
  ","
  ...W-what? ..Just..f-forget I said anything..*Reaper quickly darts his eye away, he might of had a nightmare earlier..along with finding his brother being possessed..*
  "
5347,"
   *Geno grabs Reaper's hand and has the God facepalm himself* I'm not scared of you, I'm scared of the outcocme of some of the stupid things you do. I'm scared FOR you
  ","
  *Reaper seemed a bit freaked that Geno held his hand and quickly pulled away after Geno made him well, facepalm himself* D-don't do that! I'm scared you'll--w-wait..what?
  
  Your.. ... Geno.. ...
  
  ..
  "
5348,"
   I love you too, so stop doing things that scare me half to you
  ","
  *Reaper looked as though he wanted to hug Geno and reached his arms for him..but stopped himself midway and pulled his arms back to himself*
  
  ..Sorry about that..Death tends to be scary..doesn't it?
  "
5349,"
   YES it would! Besides I poured out all the bleach in the house and replaced it with water. It's much harder to get the blood out of my clothes though without using bleach *Geno sighs* But I can't go through you getting drunk and doing something dumb again
  ","
  *Reaper was a bit surprised to hear that and stared at Geno with his lone eye starting to fill back up with tears*..
  
  G-Geno...I know I say this a lot..but I say it it's because it's true.. I love you.. ..you didn't have to..
  "
5350,"
   Reaper, it's worse if I find out on my own
  ","
  ..Love.. ..*Reaper holds his skull in his hands as he lets out a sigh*...damn it..  would more bleach harm anything..?
  
  *Don't do that!*
  "
5351,"
   Ok, what happened, you're avoiding eye contact *whelp that didn't last long*
  ","
  N-nothing, nothing.. it's fine.. *Reaper waves a hand dismissively, trying to act as though nothing is wrong but he can't bring himself to look Geno in the eye* ..
  "
5352,"
   *Geno noticed Reaper tensed, but he's not gonna press the issue... for now* Well at least I didn't sleep a week like I first said I felt like
  ","
  ..That's..that's true.. I'd be worried you fell into a coma from having a lazy overload..
  
  *Reaper kept his gaze distant and avoided locking eyes with Geno* ..
  "
5353,"
   I was very tired, nothing bad happened though right
  ","
  ..*Reaper seemed to tense up at that and was a little uneasy*.. Y-yeah..nothing happened.. I'm just happy your okay Love..
  "
5354,"
   *Geno stretches and sits up*
  ","
  You kinda..slept all day..you okay Love..?
  "
5355,"
   Did you just take a picture of me?
  ","
  Uh..maybe? I can't help it though Love~ Your so cute~
  "
5356,"
   -

   @DontcallmeSans
  
"
5357,"
   *Geno will get mad about that pic XD*
  ","
  *But he's so cute lol*
  
  *I actually found a comic where he does something similar*
  "
5358,"
   *Geno's just asleep, still hugging the Reaper plush, nothing happened, the guy is just really tired*
  ","
  ..*Reaper sighs in relief once seeing Geno was still okay..though oddly afterwards, he got himself up off the bed and sat in a chair at Genos bedside inside, refusing to sleep next to his Tsundere*..
  
  *While in the chair, he does take a moment to pull out his phone and snap a picture of Geno with the plush he gave him*
  
  So cute~
  "
5359,"
   just asking how Geno is, if you need to rest though
  ","
  ..W-wait--how IS HE..!? *Reaper seems a bit panicked and quickly checks
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  *
  "
5360,"
   How's Geno doing?
  ","
  *Reaper seemed to have dozed off for a moment on accident but he's woken back up not long after he heard you mention Genos name* ..W-what..?
  "
5361,"
   I'm just really tired, haven't gotten decent sleep in ages
  ","
  ..Sorry..*Oof..**Reaper just quietly sits there as he keeps a close eye on Geno*...
  "
5362,"
   just let me sleep.
  ","
  ..B-but.. *Reaper is honestly very concerned but he let's Geno sleep for now* ... you better be okay..
  "
5363,"
   what? *he really doesn't wanna wake back up*
  ","
  Just..had to make sure your okay.. ..it's ..not like you to nod out that quick..
