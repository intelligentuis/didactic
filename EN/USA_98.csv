  I'm not really sure. My body comp is pretty different. It's difficult to have the actual amount since I don't weigh myself all the time. I also have pcos with the insulin resistance going on so that makes it harder in general. Numbers can be more high even when I feel smaller-_-
  
  Was more of a lifestyle change. Diets never worked for long. Swimming, zumba, at home workouts, walking more. Eating better. I gave up drinking Pepsi.
  
  I see more results with the gym though. Get more into a routine. I look forward to it more than just doing a video or whatever. Seems more rewarding to me too like i did more.

  Since I'm in AZ right now, a few years ago a husband and wife ended up getting killed. They had search parties, on the news. It was more of a disappearance case until the truth came out.
  
  Also in MA, there was a guy traveling through the town and ended up putting his kill into a storage unit inside a fridge/ice box. That was freaky.

  Every case would be different. I know two teacher's who got married. She's actually a special education teacher and their 1st kid has it. So it was cool that she knew everything to do right. He seems pretty normal though. Definitely needs to learn how to stick up for himself.
  
  This kid was messing with him a few years ago. I was down near the water and heard it all. The kid ended up pushing his sister down to get a rise out of him. That's where I stepped in. I didn't want to hear or see that crap. Also their grandparents are family friends so I felt like I had more responsibility to them. They both thanked me later on and also the kid has always hated me since üòÇ Like they were fighting over nothing. He was firm in his mindset and the kid wouldn't take no for an answer and then did that to his sister for no reason. I could tell he was getting mad but didn't do or say anything.

   One things that scares you the most
  ","
  Drugs can be pretty scary. I've known a lot of people who have died from heroin overdoses.
  
  Also a childhood friend has 5 kids with her husband and I guess she did a 360 because she doesn't have them anymore. I'm not sure if it's heroin, crack, meth, pills or what. Her whole FB page is all these affirmations about making the day great, doing my best and everything else. Doing meetings. Empty promises. I guess she went over the deep end after having a still born baby and didn't know how to cope. Her whole family was basically on drugs and alcoholics growing up. It's just sad that she got sucked in since she was the ""normal"" one out of her family. Her brother even died from drugs...

   Hey guys! üòä For you: How are you doing today? How went your day? 

-Ciao peeps-
  ","
  Indecisive seems to fit! We were going to have a bbq then it changed into hibachi THEN finally they settled on a restaurant inside the casino. Which was very pretty looking inside, decent prices but the food wasn't really food lol My mom and I ended up splitting lobster crab dip which came with a few pieces of bread, some chips. We didn't taste any lobster  (was supposed to be a tail) and you could tell that the crab was more of the canned variety. Meanwhile the buffet part gets legit meat. Also the tenderloin steak was the size of a mushroom cap. It was very dainty and not filling at all ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
  "

  doesn't matter but I feel like socks are just gross to wear in AZ. Luckily, the weather is getting lower but it's still in the 90s.

   I'm always in a can't be bothred mood are you like that
  ","
  Sometimes. Like earlier at dinner. It was hard to communicate since the music was so loud. Also the topics discussed didn't interest me. I don't know the brother-in-law's brother too much but I absolutely no nothing about his wife and she was all pissed off over the political conversation they were having. Being all dramatic that she was going to leave. Being loud about it too. Her parents were nice but she's literally such a strange person lol.
  "

  I suppose but if it happened years ago why be petty and drag up stuff that literally doesn't matter anymore?

  People can have opinions. Most times I'm not focusing on the name and might agree with what is posted.. half the time they don't mention their name but the situation could fit ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
  
  I have nothing against Ash. Pretty misunderstood, I think. People b!tch about the smallest things, it's ridiculous. I can see both views. I don't need to be for or against either sides. Mom drama is interesting.

  There's a two year difference between my sister and I so we've always been close. She was mean to me though at times üòÇ first haircut, made me stick my head near the oven and blew smoke at me. Apparently i wore an eyepatch for a little while, I don't remember that part... made me stick my finger into a outlet. Kicked my bully in the balls for me. She has an old library card with the words ""license to hate Lyndsey"" on it. haha.. we're good. I was one of the bridesmaids in her wedding. We're staying at their house right now etc
  
  I'm not that close with my brother. There's a ten year difference. So basically he was off to college and we were still pretty young. Then after that he moved in with our grandpa so it's like he just wasn't really there. Also he ended up moving to Arizona on my high school graduation day. The only childhood memories are the forts we'd make around the tv, basically the whole room, balloon fights. The time he was drinking and puked all over my sister's stuffed animal. The time he got into a fight and he was drunk and punched the tree instead of the person üòÇ he lost his hat and made us go find it. It's pretty much just about his kids these days. he'll be all can't wait to see you but then when in the same area, you don't see each other at all lol like probably only seen 5 times in 5 months???

  Eggs were fun to do! We'd always have an easter egg hunt. My sister would always win. One year, i won and she basically had a tantrum üòÇ She was probably 15 or something XD I feel like we just didn't do it after that because we were both getting older too.

  I have 2381 followers. I don't see the appeal either. I have days where I'm more social and then times where I'm more focused on questions. I don't always need to be that annoying person who nonstops asks someone a bunch of follow up questions on one topic. A lot of the people i follow also hate small talk so that can feel a bit intimidating to find neutral ground with those people. People either like me or hate me, I'm indifferent to it. Chances are i don't need those people who hate me in my life. I'm not into drama. I'm a tad older than some of the other females here. I don't have kids. League of my own, really.

  Sister-in-law's sister was all ""cochonda"" to her mom and it made me laugh. Which basically is asking if she's horny. Then they explained to her brother's gf that the mom was talking dirty kind of thing. She doesn't know that much Spanish either, apparently.

  I've found that connection is key on a deeper level. Sometimes you'll see someone and just know their meant to be in your life at that certain time. Love to me shouldn't be forced. You need open communication, trust and honesty. They should feel like a best friend. You can tell them anything without them judging. They would tell you deeper things that they might not have talked about. You both want to be better together. It will come to you usually when unexpected.
  
  if that didn't help at all... what specific thing are you looking for? I give better advice when there's a backstory.

   Thoughts on Sharing nudes?
  ","
  Why is sharing capitalized?
  
  In general? I don't think there's anything too bad about it if both are ADULTS and they both trust the person not to share with everyone else. Obviously when younger a lot of things could happen so a grown ass man should know better lol
  
  Mine? I wouldn't trust just anyone with them. Like yes, I'm naughty, doesn't mean you will get nudes straight away. Especially when that is the first thing they ask you when talking privately. Like you are anon.. I usually don't know anything about the person. It's pretty forward. I would like some kind of dignity still. Not everyone should see that unless I actually went into the s3x field then that would be different.
  
  Getting nudes? It's fine if the topic came up. Not so cute when they just give you one out of the blue... unless in a relationship with them then it could be more endearing

   ""I'm female and I don't use pronouns"" I'm not sure how to interpret that. You said in the past you use someone's 'preferred pronouns' if they want that. You sound as if maybe you don't take the ""pronouns club"" seriously. (were you implying that the tumblr couple were crazy as well..)
  ","
  The question is vague. Ash uses they/them. The person said ""That you?"". I'm not Ash is what I meant.
  
  it wasn't throwing shade at what they like to be known as. If someone uses certain pronouns then I'd make sure to use them.
  
  Tumblr couple? Also, I don't like using the word crazy since mental health shouldn't be joked about.

  ","
  When my old dog got sick from drinking at the lake and bought her to the vet to see what was going on. There was a flash of lightning and the car ahead of ours just took a dog out of their car and the legs were straight up in the air. The dog was so stiff. r.i.p. The dog was all white so the lightning didn't help that either.
  
  When my sister had a cyst and it ruptured, internal bleeding. Surgery.
  
  The time Lulu had a seizure. She woke up and I noticed she was walking weird. Then her legs got all bent and crazy like. was due to lyme disease. We were camping at the time. She felt fine then wasn't. Also all the current stuff has been scary but at the same time i kind of didn't think of it since wouldn't have been good to have that mindset.
  
  The time we were on vacation in Myrtle Beach! It was late at night and the owner dude gave OUR key to someone. Luckily, we did use the chain. Was freaking scary. like they were still trying to get in! Never seen my dad jump to action so fast. He was pushing the door closed.  Of course Domino (border collie that died earlier this year) was hiding under the table, never barked. cops were called then found out what happened later.
  
  On the trip back from mb, we were in Virginia. Stayed at some shitty motel. Mom went out to get some ice and drinks at the vending machine. This guy was following her back to the room creepily. Looking into other rooms, just being really shady. She got back to the room and was all ""did you lock the car"" type thing. A few minutes later my dad and the dog go outside to check and walk her. Then we heard god awful screaming. He came back into the room. Turns out it was the guy who was being shady. He ended up going into the lobby. It was some older lady working. She ended up saying she needed to use the bathroom. Ran into the office part which had those glass areas where you take money from and was yelling into that thing and did silent alarm. He ended up taking off. There were so many cops there in moments.

  The body was the 2nd biggest. I don't think that the biggest one was accurate. I have a longer torso than actually a big stomach like the bigger one shows. Maybe in 2007, I would have picked that one.

  tops hang more on me than hugging everything
  
  i don't think the bigger one really shows off broad shoulders

  Even the dr i went to here didn't know much about it. My sister was pretty much schooling her lol She has it too but actually gets the cysts side of it. Doing all the fertility stuff etc

  Think I'll watch an episode of Stay Here.
  
  I watched the first one recently and it was pretty cool. I like those home renovation shows! This one is basically for renters to get more money out of the rental. The first episode was a house boat and it turned out beautiful. It's basically like airbnb properties that are disgusting looking and they remodel them like other shows so the owners get more $$$ when people rent them.

  If it's a problem in the marriage, they don't have a job and stuff like that then yes, it's a real problem.

  My brother has a good bank job, two boys and he likes playing video games with them. But the kids also do a lot of sports, outside the majority of the time and all that. A good balance would be beneficial.
  
  It really depends on the individual. Video games and anime can be relaxing for them, bring back nostalgia. I feel like the action figures can be a bit more extreme and expensive. It shouldn't be 24/7...
