  it was ok. My BIL's brother doesn't like sushi even though they serve other food so we ended up going to Dickey's barbecue instead. First time eating there. Wasn't the best, wasn't the worst. I ended up getting chicken, mashed potatoes and green beans.
  
  Then the bil's dad came over afterwards, spent time talking.
  
  My mom and I just got back from Walmart a few moments ago. There's some beast cancer rally soon so I ended up buying a pink shirt. Didn't plan on it but cool that i got one now to help support.

   How much weight have you lost and how did you do it?
  ","
  I'm not really sure. My body comp is pretty different. It's difficult to have the actual amount since I don't weigh myself all the time. I also have pcos with the insulin resistance going on so that makes it harder in general. Numbers can be more high even when I feel smaller-_-
  
  Was more of a lifestyle change. Diets never worked for long. Swimming, zumba, at home workouts, walking more. Eating better. I gave up drinking Pepsi.
  
  I see more results with the gym though. Get more into a routine. I look forward to it more than just doing a video or whatever. Seems more rewarding to me too like i did more.
  "
525896,"
   Sometimes we might think so but mentioning weight at all to a woman is never a good idea imo... even if it's a compliment they always find a way to take it wrong.

  Every case would be different. I know two teacher's who got married. She's actually a special education teacher and their 1st kid has it. So it was cool that she knew everything to do right. He seems pretty normal though. Definitely needs to learn how to stick up for himself.
  
  This kid was messing with him a few years ago. I was down near the water and heard it all. The kid ended up pushing his sister down to get a rise out of him. That's where I stepped in. I didn't want to hear or see that crap. Also their grandparents are family friends so I felt like I had more responsibility to them. They both thanked me later on and also the kid has always hated me since 😂 Like they were fighting over nothing. He was firm in his mindset and the kid wouldn't take no for an answer and then did that to his sister for no reason. I could tell he was getting mad but didn't do or say anything.

   One things that scares you the most
  ","
  Drugs can be pretty scary. I've known a lot of people who have died from heroin overdoses.
  
  Also a childhood friend has 5 kids with her husband and I guess she did a 360 because she doesn't have them anymore. I'm not sure if it's heroin, crack, meth, pills or what. Her whole FB page is all these affirmations about making the day great, doing my best and everything else. Doing meetings. Empty promises. I guess she went over the deep end after having a still born baby and didn't know how to cope. Her whole family was basically on drugs and alcoholics growing up. It's just sad that she got sucked in since she was the ""normal"" one out of her family. Her brother even died from drugs...

Which was very pretty looking inside, decent prices but the food wasn't really food lol My mom and I ended up splitting lobster crab dip which came with a few pieces of bread, some chips. We didn't taste any lobster  (was supposed to be a tail) and you could tell that the crab was more of the canned variety. Meanwhile the buffet part gets legit meat. Also the tenderloin steak was the size of a mushroom cap. It was very dainty and not filling at all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  Sometimes. Like earlier at dinner. It was hard to communicate since the music was so loud. Also the topics discussed didn't interest me. I don't know the brother-in-law's brother too much but I absolutely no nothing about his wife and she was all pissed off over the political conversation they were having. Being all dramatic that she was going to leave. Being loud about it too. Her parents were nice but she's literally such a strange person lol.

   Are you/were close to your siblings? Has adult life changed your relationship?
  ","
  There's a two year difference between my sister and I so we've always been close. She was mean to me though at times 😂 first haircut, made me stick my head near the oven and blew smoke at me. Apparently i wore an eyepatch for a little while, I don't remember that part... made me stick my finger into a outlet. Kicked my bully in the balls for me. She has an old library card with the words ""license to hate Lyndsey"" on it. haha.. we're good. I was one of the bridesmaids in her wedding. We're staying at their house right now etc
  
  I'm not that close with my brother. There's a ten year difference. So basically he was off to college and we were still pretty young. Then after that he moved in with our grandpa so it's like he just wasn't really there. Also he ended up moving to Arizona on my high school graduation day. The only childhood memories are the forts we'd make around the tv, basically the whole room, balloon fights. The time he was drinking and puked all over my sister's stuffed animal. The time he got into a fight and he was drunk and punched the tree instead of the person 😂 he lost his hat and made us go find it. It's pretty much just about his kids these days. he'll be all can't wait to see you but then when in the same area, you don't see each other at all lol like probably only seen 5 times in 5 months???
  "
526994,"
   that makes sense cuz that other person who asked might as well be him wanting to know bout himself lol
  ","
  The serious question? eh.. I feel like he'd ask me stuff like that in private.

526995,"
   yeah she is but bossy too lol
  ","
  Are you the youngest?
  "
526996,"
   I'm a girl and It's been really hard for me to get a guy friend. I seem shy but idk why because I'm really lovable and weird. I'm 20 but feel making a guy.friend is not as easy.

   decorating easter eggs or bing jack’o’lanterns?
  ","
  I liked pumpkins more for the seeds. So good. Fun to get dirty o.o I wouldn't really crave them. My sister was more into that and better designs as well.
  
  Eggs were fun to do! We'd always have an easter egg hunt. My sister would always win. One year, i won and she basically had a tantrum 😂 She was probably 15 or something XD I feel like we just didn't do it after that because we were both getting older too. But it's cool seeing the nephews do theres! And we'd give them hints. Also since their Spanish they use those eggs with confetti stuff in them so we kind of have wars smashing them against people's heads etc

  I think so. I don't really see the symptoms in myself. The doctor barely even talked to me, I didn't even go in the office or anything. She diagnosed in the lobby. She was apparently the best in the business but it just seemed so unprofessional. Wasn't ever questioned kind of thing.
  
  I did some research a while ago and found something that seemed more accurate but I don't remember what the name of it was. It's basically related / misdiagnosed as the other thing since they are a bit similar.

  so basically like Me Before You.
  
  I think I'd try to help them. Even if we didn't stay together, I'd still want to be around and help. If I truly felt he was the one before the accident then my feelings shouldn't change because the structure of the relationship changed. The communication would be the hardest, especially if he didn't want to or couldn't learn sign language.

  I married someone when playing house. I never know if he should count! Anyways, we both ended up moving away. Then seeing each other every few years and he always seemed really happy to see me again. It's cute.
  
  Real first guy that I dated. I don't think he really liked me all that much but we did date lol My best friend must have been jealous and ended up kissing him. Basically stopped after that. He was all i don't even like her but ya.. short lived lol
  
  The same best friend set me up with the guy. He was totally still in love with his ex. I guess he wanted me to fight for him or something but clearly the ex would win.. he mentioned how she was coming back to town. We never talked after that phone call 😂 so I imagine that they did get back together. Was funny since she wanted to kill him when I told her that XD he's the one that ended up dying a few years ago. r.i.p
  
  the one that I just mentioned in another question. 2 years

   After spending some time here, I fail to visualize what people see in you. You strike me as a person who doesn't put in any effort whatsoever towards others. It's more like if it happens that's cool, and if it doesn't then nothing is lost.
  ","
  I have 2381 followers. I don't see the appeal either. I have days where I'm more social and then times where I'm more focused on questions. I don't always need to be that annoying person who nonstops asks someone a bunch of follow up questions on one topic. A lot of the people i follow also hate small talk so that can feel a bit intimidating to find neutral ground with those people. People either like me or hate me, I'm indifferent to it. Chances are i don't need those people who hate me in my life. I'm not into drama. I'm a tad older than some of the other females here. I don't have kids. League of my own, really. I'd rather have substance instead of ""how are you "" etc
  
  Who are you to pass judgments anyways? It's not necessary.

  I've found that connection is key on a deeper level. Sometimes you'll see someone and just know their meant to be in your life at that certain time. Love to me shouldn't be forced. You need open communication, trust and honesty. They should feel like a best friend. You can tell them anything without them judging. They would tell you deeper things that they might not have talked about. You both want to be better together. It will come to you usually when unexpected.
  
  if that didn't help at all... what specific thing are you looking for? I give better advice when there's a backstory.

   Thoughts on Sharing nudes?
  ","
  Why is sharing capitalized?
  
  In general? I don't think there's anything too bad about it if both are ADULTS and they both trust the person not to share with everyone else. Obviously when younger a lot of things could happen so a grown ass man should know better lol
  
  Mine? I wouldn't trust just anyone with them. Like yes, I'm naughty, doesn't mean you will get nudes straight away. Especially when that is the first thing they ask you when talking privately. Like you are anon.. I usually don't know anything about the person. It's pretty forward. I would like some kind of dignity still. Not everyone should see that unless I actually went into the s3x field then that would be different.
  
  Getting nudes? It's fine if the topic came up. Not so cute when they just give you one out of the blue... unless in a relationship with them then it could be more endearing

   ""I'm female and I don't use pronouns"" I'm not sure how to interpret that. You said in the past you use someone's 'preferred pronouns' if they want that. You sound as if maybe you don't take the ""pronouns club"" seriously. (were you implying that the tumblr couple were crazy as well..)
  ","
  The question is vague. Ash uses they/them. The person said ""That you?"". I'm not Ash is what I meant.
  
  it wasn't throwing shade at what they like to be known as. If someone uses certain pronouns then I'd make sure to use them.
  
  Tumblr couple? Also, I don't like using the word crazy since mental health shouldn't be joked about.

Was more one of those relationships that should have ended way sooner. His friend liked him and I ended up mentioning that when I dumped him. The only time I've dumped someone too lol They ended up going out :)
  
  2. My fault but it was somewhat mutual too. I ended up having a wall up so it was difficult after that. I didn't notice at the time but ya.. I don't really like going into everything, sorry.

   What’s the most scared you’ve ever been?
  ","
  When my old dog got sick from drinking at the lake and bought her to the vet to see what was going on. There was a flash of lightning and the car ahead of ours just took a dog out of their car and the legs were straight up in the air. The dog was so stiff. r.i.p. The dog was all white so the lightning didn't help that either.
  
  When my sister had a cyst and it ruptured, internal bleeding. Surgery.
  
  The time Lulu had a seizure. She woke up and I noticed she was walking weird. Then her legs got all bent and crazy like. was due to lyme disease. We were camping at the time. She felt fine then wasn't. Also all the current stuff has been scary but at the same time i kind of didn't think of it since wouldn't have been good to have that mindset.
  
  The time we were on vacation in Myrtle Beach! It was late at night and the owner dude gave OUR key to someone. Luckily, we did use the chain. Was freaking scary. like they were still trying to get in! Never seen my dad jump to action so fast. He was pushing the door closed.  Of course Domino (border collie that died earlier this year) was hiding under the table, never barked. cops were called then found out what happened later.
  
  On the trip back from mb, we were in Virginia. Stayed at some shitty motel. Mom went out to get some ice and drinks at the vending machine. This guy was following her back to the room creepily. Looking into other rooms, just being really shady. She got back to the room and was all ""did you lock the car"" type thing. A few minutes later my dad and the dog go outside to check and walk her. Then we heard god awful screaming. He came back into the room. Turns out it was the guy who was being shady. He ended up going into the lobby. It was some older lady working. She ended up saying she needed to use the bathroom. Ran into the office part which had those glass areas where you take money from and was yelling into that thing and did silent alarm. He ended up taking off. There were so many cops there in moments.

  The body was the 2nd biggest. I don't think that the biggest one was accurate. I have a longer torso than actually a big stomach like the bigger one shows. Maybe in 2007, I would have picked that one.

  tops hang more on me than hugging everything
  
  i don't think the bigger one really shows off broad shoulders

  I did preschool. Not too much lol art, music, interact with other students. Have a bully who always took the toys i was playing with, knocked blocks over. My sister ended up kicking him in the balls one day since he was at the park.. never saw him after that.
  
  There was this tree that had a weird trunk. Water would always get trapped in it. This girl and I would always meet at recess there and act like we were making soup and stuff. putting twigs and other stuff in it. I'm surprised that we didn't get in trouble since we were kind of hidden from view lol

  Even the dr i went to here didn't know much about it. My sister was pretty much schooling her lol She has it too but actually gets the cysts side of it. Doing all the fertility stuff etc
  
  Also i guess our dog wanted to join in on the fun since she ended up getting an infection (i forget the term right now) since she's never been sprayed/had pups so had to have emergency surgery to get her ovaries out a few days ago. She's doing much better now

  Think I'll watch an episode of Stay Here.
  
  I watched the first one recently and it was pretty cool. I like those home renovation shows! This one is basically for renters to get more money out of the rental. The first episode was a house boat and it turned out beautiful. It's basically like airbnb properties that are disgusting looking and they remodel them like other shows so the owners get more $$$ when people rent them.

  I should get rid of a lot because I feel like those ones don't talk to me. I'd rather not always start a conversation with random people added too. I talk to 3-5 at most on the regular.. if people added me they should definitely be more willing to talk and effort. Also in nonsexual ways :P

  i get tagged more on FB. but I never really like those pictures enough to share here or elsewhere.
  
  My SIL likes zooming in and basically being inches away from me so never a good photo of me when she's around. Even my brother used her phone before and those ones weren't too bad so I know that she does do the zoom. 💀
  
  probably another reason why I don't like taking pictures since she gives me false sense of self.. like I even took a picture the next day kind of thing before and it wasn't hideous like the one she took which also explains the zoom...

  If it's a problem in the marriage, they don't have a job and stuff like that then yes, it's a real problem.
  
  If it's every now and then, have their life together then I think it can be a different story.
  
  My brother has a good bank job, two boys and he likes playing video games with them. But the kids also do a lot of sports, outside the majority of the time and all that. A good balance would be beneficial.
  
  It really depends on the individual. Video games and anime can be relaxing for them, bring back nostalgia. I feel like the action figures can be a bit more extreme and expensive. It shouldn't be 24/7...

  no. I just don't give a shit what strangers think anymore. I still get fat/overweight and other terms even when people haven't seen me which is pretty laughable on here. Maybe when younger, I was.

  I eat way healthier now. I go to the gym. My body composition is way different but I'm still big. And I know most of it is because of pcos now. I know someone will comment hateful stuff about that too.
  
  Have fun. Also being rude isn't going to make me want to take pictures either.

  Yup! was 7ish when I found out. I know if we were in Maine she really would have been a goner. They have one emergency hospital and last time she went there (had a seizure) the male doctor looked stoned, kept saying she was a different kind of dog, called her a him and other stuff. Also ended up shaving her butt (no idea why!) and that got infected. Took her to the real vet the next day and it was lyme disease not what the other dr was saying.. he was all ""ticks wouldn't make dogs seizure. It's neurological"" 😂 like omg lol they probably would have said she was fine 😮

  Yes. I went to the gym and then found out that mom brought her to the vet and needed all that done. Scary. I was just like i need to distract myself from thinking about her. only 7 pounds so could have been bad too.
  
  ya she was all sad and not doing much... basically everything that the site said. She wasn't puking though but I guess on the way she did. You could tell she just wasn't herself. Also felt bloated. haven't been going bathroom much besides pee so we all thought she was just constipated. luckily got her to the vet then... she had a appointment for the next day and probably wouldn't have made it type thing... even the dr said that.

  Not really. She ended up getting a boyfriend and just drifted apart. Also both of us moved soon after that. I also transferred to a vocational technical high school in a town nearby so that put distance between us too.

   Random rumblins heard on the radio: A lady brought back a 4k ultra High definition television because the people on the screen looked "" too lifelike and scary "" even though it was explained to her BEFORE she got it that everything would be in high  resolution.

  I don't really keep track of stuff like that.

  Yes. Mostly hate. Ones from Lahore. Ones i don't have an answer for and rather not waste time being all idk or no to. Some about other people.. like cool, i don't care. Some pap ones lately instead of writing excuses for not taking a picture right then and there. I'll get to it.. chill. Some s3xual ones that go too far.

   how long have you had big feet for?
  ","
  Do people really keep track of that?
  
  I think it runs in the family. Obviously depends on the brand sizing..
  
  mom is 8/9
  
  sister is 6/7
  
  dad and brother are 10/11
  "
531025,"
   cool

  busy dreaming of sleep.
  "
531029,"
   You have good feet .
  ","
  I had an anon who said that they were fat and ugly 😂
  
  I think most 9/9.5 sized feet would be a tad bigger looking? I used to be a solid 10.
  
  The camera angle probably wasn't the best either.
  
  Also, I personally feel that feet can be ugly so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  "
531030,"
   are you busy or  free ?
  ","
  in what way?
  "
531031,"
   Do you like to give foot fetish?
  ","
  I can't give a fetish that I don't personally have.
  "
531032,"
   Were you an honors student in school?

  I was on honor roll a lot throughout my schooling.
  
  If you meant AP type honor classes, no.
