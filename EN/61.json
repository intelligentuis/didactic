that for me . not once has someone offered me help when it was obvious i was hurting . there has only been one person who has noticed that something was wrong or bothering me . it was my producer and she gave me a cupcake with an m m smile on it . i fucking cried . because as little of a gesture it was . it was the fact the she was the only person to ever notice , and she was the only one to actually say do something nice . but since then , that was mind you . . . and since there has one other person asked to see if i m alright , is everything alright . not one person who was ever there evenwhen they said they would be . . no one had kept there . so why ? ! why should i keep continuing with trying to help others who either don t want it or don t care to notice it . when can i just give up on everyone and finally just focus on my self . because every single time i help someone to be in a better place , i always end up being the one who s gets broken into pieces because of the weight of the situation . i m tired . i m so fucking tired . i so sad and depressed for so goddamn long and no one noticed or no one put a hand out to help me for sinking in my depression . until i met someone who unknown their knowledge took it all away . and when they left without a word , i was crushed like i was back to the beginning . i don t ask anyone to take some of my burdens , or ask them to do things for me , i ask for nothing ! i legit feel dead inside at times bc of that feeling . do you know what that s like ? ! to be the one who d do any and everything for someone , take help

it depend . . does the narcissist want to come back ? i m going to say yes , they do , otherwise you would ve have asked this question in the first place . and it also depends on if the one who was being ghosted believes in the reasons as to why the narcissist wants to come back . would your intentions be true ? understand , someone who could also very well be a narcissist themselves do know how to read when someone is lying . . so it s more on if the reason you d want to come back , are honest and true , and that you really want to come back . im more than certain that the other party would be more than happy to accept your back . but i don t think they d be willing to put up with the unnecessary pettiness . you know , being ghosted can change someone , i would know . as i m speaking from my own experience . there s a certain pressure point that is developed in the person who was ghosted . that pressure point is self made , in case they need some sort of defense mechanism . they don t want to have it , but it s one of the side of effects of losing trust in people . i m sure the person has a side of them that is still as compassionate as ever before , but there s also a cold side that perhaps they kept down for years because , well , they needed to . basically without the repetitiveness , if you do come back . come back for the right reasons . come back because you re reasons are true , and are you . give and show they why they should believe you . i m not saying just lay it all out on the table , i get things take time to develop rebuild but as long as both are willing and wanting to heal old wounds , it takes the trust and honesty from both side . . letting people hurt those who didn t deserve it , is done . just be your true self if you do decide to do that , because you d be taken back with arms wide open . . . . sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith in order to find out . also , since we re both speaking in vague as fuck riddles , lol ,

happiness , as in i have a special ability to make a person feel by watching something i edit . there s a sense of satisfaction when i get a particular response . i m doing what i dreamed of doing , i m fortunate enough to get that chance and opportunity to do so . when i found this , this is what i spend every single moment trying to perfect . i focused on me and myself , because , you re the only one whos going to be affected by your choices , good or bad . so with the time you have , is it better to worry and kill yourself over what other people who mean no real significance in your life ,

i like so much ? there s only one person i hate with a passion .","57317":"not this guy .","57318":"person orgy . . . .","57319":"that s not home . that s an illusion . you re still at don juan the hoodrat mom s place . . . . don t let the red bull take you further than you can handle . . . just know your limits . . . . mine limit is when the stuff bears start to vomit strawberry lasagna . . . like wtf . . . who puts olives in their milk ? ? ! side question , do they still live with jamie the panther whiff ?","57320":"that s a discussion better suited in a more private environment . i ll say this , i was when it happened .","57321":"let s just say it s not something i d willingly want to use , ever .","57322":"fusion titanium","57323":"yes , i will","57324":"then my skin would probably be as worn out as a condom would be in during a person orgy .","57325":"yes i ve done this . i ve also spit water out of my ass from laughter as well . i believe they call that a shart . then it s all downhill from there because once you start , you can t stop . so you might as well finish .","57326":"how am i spending my monday ? well . . . two days ago it was alligator , not monday . i know i knkw , i will remember to drinketh thy blood .","57327":"i try to be myself most of the time , unless i m with a client . lol . then of course im goody goody two shoes . . . . . until they get to actually know me and then i ll open up and be a little bit more open with my opinion lol . but yeah i try to be ass genuine as i can possibly be regardless of who i m around .","57328":"smoke weed , play loud music , then enjoy the environment around me because usually when i m driving i don t get the chance to really take in my surroundings as much as i d like .","57329":"seeing people help out others while actually being genuine about it . not recording it and posting it on social media , so get likes , or tweets , or for clout . or whatever the fuck you wanna call it . but seeing someone help somebody because you re able to . and if they actually need it . perhaps they needed it more than you . you do it out of the kindness of your heart , not because you seek recognition . for instance a couple weeks ago i was driving home and i saw this person i am who s car was stuck like in the middle of the intersection that was pretty busy . and not one fucking person offered to help this lady push her car . she was obviously struggling , and she was a small lady too . i saw that , and instantly , pulled over , got out , and helped her push her car . she was trying to push the car while trying to steer the bitch at the same time . not a very easy thing to do when your a small person . i shit you not , there wasn t one other person to offer help . it took all but seconds to do . people are assholes .","57330":"yes , i have . but i could use another . that d require me seeing her . . . .","57331":"loyalty , then honesty , followed by me being a beautiful bitch .","57332":"they should re open .","57333":"that s good . what was your inspiration","57334":"yes","57335":"report","57336":"no but i ve always wanted one","57337":"fap fap fap fap fap fap fap","57338":"it s sunday but sure good morning to you as well","57339":"well there s only one of me so . . . . . . there s your answer ?","57340":"i m sure this is a true story . . . . . . . and if you let yourself get detention over that , you kinda deserved it .","57341":"yeah i can t stand the smell of farts or some shit in themselves or vomit that s been sitting for a couple of hours or even days . mhmmm i don t know for certain , but judging by the looks of it i m pretty sure dick cheese will probably stink","57342":"i am not the person you should be asking about that i know jack shit about hair .","57343":"nothing but positive vibes .","57344":"if you re going if you re referring to this particular situation being a person i said go with your heart gut instinct . take it from me in my experience i let myself get in my head too much , if i just went along with how things were supposed to be naturally by following my gut instinct , i think things would ve been a lot better on my end . and perhaps they will , and i hope they do , go better on your end . the heart knows what the heart wants","57345":"doo doo brown","57346":"i love going to the store i m just like being able to go to the store and see what s there on display , rather than what s being shown as popular online or what s the best sellers . in store is less bias .","57347":"spanish french italian german and russian .","57348":"pepperoni","57349":"i try to use it a lot to so i can i keep up with trying to answer all these questions . but the time this process can take is just to answer one fucking question . you answer one question , but you have to wait like seconds after each time . ugh . . ."}}
