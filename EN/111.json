in my backyard","103548":"no this might be hard to believe but i m not also a bird","103549":"just owl things like knick knacks and pillows and stuffed animals and stationary and kitchenware and i have two owl crock pots and owl socks and owl whatever","103550":"no but regular bird seed diets don t have the calcium and protein that a bird needs to live a long healthy life so i supplement with veggies , fruit , nuts , eggs , chicken , cereal , etc","103551":"i collect owls and my favorite owl is a great horned owl , or bubo virginius","103552":"all those things . and also specifically today about yellow leaves falling in my yard and why do people like milky way candy when it s so boring and what kind of calcium foods can i give bubo this week","103553":"yeah i mean it s pretty rad i get to eat food and think about things","103554":"i hope so","103555":"no but bubo likes to preen em","103556":"i already voted , washington state has mail in ballots","103557":"i don t feel like it is as bad as it was like years ago but yeah i could see why someone might think so","103558":"he s an adult , so i don t know if telling your parents would really change anything . if it ll make you feel better to tell an adult , then go for it . otherwise i think it s really your brother s choice to be reckless as much as that sucks . you could try talking directly to him again but if he doesn t listen then i dunno dude .","103559":"omg not much i m so bored today bubo is taking her nap behind my left monitor and i m sitting here drinking coffee and listening to music with my foot propped up","103560":"i dunno how it just sort of gets to be a regular thing that i m not that worried about except for sometimes then again it s been a few years since i ve worked so maybe it s harder or easier now who knows","103561":"i guess not getting out west sooner . the west coast saved my life .","103562":"i m just want to be dressed by a designer and wear something couture . something wild though and colorful .","103563":"i can t recall a most interesting but i enjoy most questions that aren t malicious or repeats of things i literally just answered or fetish fueled .","103564":"thanks danny d","103565":"i do it all the time no worries and thank you","103566":"pink flowers on my dress","103567":"parents loved me","103568":"i don t know , we don t have a relationship","103569":"my youngest sibling years younger than me got spoiled pretty hard but like , that s fine because my grandma liked me best it doesn t bother me mom was in a different place mentally and financially for him than with me but like , i do feel like it would have been nice to not have had such a neglectful and shitty childhood","103570":"my friend david is my favorite musician so i guess with him but like touring also sounds like a lot of work and effort ?","103571":"the weird one , the artsy one , the mentally ill one , i dunno","103572":"don t even get me started on thc testing in legal states for entry level jobs it s not like i m tryna be a brain surgeon it s a fuckin grocery store","103573":"your mom","103574":"wish i knew it s legal where i am","103575":"eh , i m probably average at it .","103576":"no nor does that interest me","103577":"i know plenty of dudes here","103578":"don t ask me . it s legal where i am .","103579":"there are a few older people accounts around here but yeah not many","103580":"probably not but that s how meds work though ? they ve corrected the chemical issues and helped me feel better . i don t consider cannabis an intoxicant at this point i smoke too much to actually ever be high . i smoke so much because i also have glaucoma and i m maintaining my eye pressure with weed alone with my optometrist s blessing , my numbers have remained steady for years and also because my antipsychotic for schizophrenia makes me nauseous and pot cures that .","103581":"i enjoy being me . one day , there won t be a me . i dunno dude","103582":"still paying it off for a whiiiiile it s a year mortgage and we re in like , year ?","103583":"yes by about k","103584":"i don t believe there s an afterlife so i guess the finality is what s scary . and because i ve come so close so many times pulmonary embolism was the most recent thing but it s like years of weird medical shit and accidents and also self induced attempts i do love living but like also it s what i know and it s something and not nothing","103585":"own","103586":"it s a tool to communicate with friends , but no i don t think the internet itself is relationship worthy","103587":"it can be annoying when i am in a rush and they card me for shit . my husband is just naturally youthful looking so it hasn t been an issue there . otherwise i kinda love it i don t want to age i m afraid of becoming old and having dementia and dying and ugh","103588":"yeah in some places certainly . i just live in a great neighborhood .","103589":"magic and gnomes","103590":"yeah , at least the one directly in front of my house and the one to the side of my house . the one across the street from my side yard is new and we haven t met them yet .","103591":"no not at all .","103592":"between and and thank you .","103593":"a little of both","103594":"yeah okay whatever we are but that s not what i meant i was separating them from humans .","103595":"you could ask an animal i guess","103596":"i doubt they re thinking i will die they re probably thinking this will hurt or this is a threat to my safety but i mean honestly i m never high enough to care about whether or not animals think about their mortality","103597":"ehhhhhhhh i dunno . it seems weird to me , like i said before , but like i guess if you re just real unimaginative in bed and genitals matter that much that they do a specific thing then who knows . maybe not transphobic . i dunno . pass .","103598":"i absolutely think less of people who don t vote","103599":"i m not really sure because my personal attractions are non exclusive so i don t know what it s like to have a preference about that sort of thing"}}
