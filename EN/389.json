out method is ineffective, and those who actually use it as their only means of birth control don't have a genuine understanding of sex and pregnancy.\n  \n  you can still get pregnant by pulling out.

mean much to me in terms of our relationship because i'm not materialistic like that.\n  \n  granted, if he was doing nothing but sitting on his as* all day and not looking for a job, then there would probably be some issues. but my boyfriend has always been the opposite of that.\n  ","417478":"\n  we've been saving, but it isn't an overnight thing unfortunately. while my new job came with a pay

under 26).\n  \n  my boyfriend got a promotion recently but the actual monetary value was sh*tty. granted, we're both in better positions than we used to be a year ago but it's still an ongoing

wolves are solitary creatures is largely false.\n  ","417481":"\n  my boyfriend makes me happy.\n  ","417482":"\n  i never had an idea of a \"\"perfect\"\" wedding because i never thought i would ever be in a position to get married.\n  \n  either way, currently i would prefer something down to earth, whimsical, and low key. perhaps somewhere outdoors during the autumn or winter months. i like a lot of the DIY things you can find online that make weddings feel more cozy.\n  ","417483":"\n  uh, what ...\n  \n  i've always felt some sort of intimate connection with wolves ever since i was young, not because i can relate to them or anything, but because they're such powerful and mysterious creatures and are often underestimated by humans. i've always wanted to visit a wolf sanctuary.\n

they haven't had anything really \"\"bad\"\" happen to them.\n  \n  that's why i don't exactly believe in karma. someone could do the worst possible thing in the world and get away with it, and there

family if you want to make a family of characters, and you can also build houses for them to live in. they live their daily lives (sleeping, eating, bathroom, work, school, etc etc.), and as you make more money, you can upgrade your home.\n  \n  it's really fun and versatile, and your characters age over time so you can watch them age from a baby all the way to elderly and they eventually die.\n

boyfriend.\n  ","417491":"\n  i think it depends on the couple and how strongly they feel about their beliefs !! there are undoubtedly some people who probably wouldn't be able to date outside of their religion, but i also think that relationships can work regardless of religious beliefs (i.e. if someone believes in god and the other person doesn't).\n  \n  i think it also comes down to a matter of respecting each other's beliefs even if they differ from yours, as long as their beliefs aren't hurting anyone.\n  ","417492":"\n  i used to be really good at drawing and painting, but i haven't done it in ages (besides random paint nights i attend rarely with my friends). i could probably draw something like my profile picture if i wanted to, haha.\n  ","417493":"\n  it needs to be done regardless, and i'd rather not have my father get stuck with doing everything for her either.\n  ","417494":"\n  i've been helping my mother do things around the house since she can't do them by herself, so since the second i got home, i've been cleaning and vacuuming and rearranging furniture and compiling garbage to take to the street.\n  \n  if this was my own place, it would be fine because obviously these things need to get done. but there's a time and a place for everything, and for some reason she put off asking me until the very last minute instead of asking me earlier in the week to do things in increments. plus, her and i don't get along so anything i have to do for her grates on my nerves.\n  ","417495":"\n  tired and frustrated. i haven't gotten a chance to sit down since i got home from work until just now, and all i want to do is crack open a beer and relax.\n  \n  other than that, i'm fine. work was productive today so at least i have that to keep in mind. i also have a concert to go to tomorrow, so i'm excited for that.\n  ","417496":"\n  this sounds like a troll question. nevertheless, if you don't love your girlfriend anymore then you should tell her. she's obviously going to be extremely upset, but no one should be forced to stay in a relationship especially if it's one sided. she may be better off without you.\n  ","417497":"\n  i don't really think following a holiday tradition is the same thing as lying to someone with cruel intention. i can totally understand why people would want to not lie to their children and tell them straight away that santa isn't real for the reason you just described above, though.\n  \n  at the same time, it might ruin the holidays for their friends, especially if they're incredibly young.\n  ","417498":"\n

course not. you're not given a pass on your behavior because youre mentally ill. if you know the difference between what's acceptable and unacceptable behavior then you should be held accountable for

think any option is fine, though -- as long as you're using something sanitary to look after yourself, and that you're comfortable using it, that's all that should matter. i don't like the concept of

countless occasions, i've asked my boyfriend if he's satisfied and assured him that if he wanted to see someone else, then he has the freedom to do that. i understand that sex is a large component of our relationship and if it's something he isn't happy with, he's under no obligation to stay.\n  ","417577":"\n  i definitely think so. granted, i would be poor af because i can't afford a one bedroom

relationship but work out some sort of compromise.\n  \n  personally speaking, if my boyfriend wasn't satisfied with our sex life and wanted to break up, i wouldn't necessarily be mad if he starts dating someone else. i personally don't think i would enter a new relationship anytime soon, though.\n  ","417581":"\n  i would be upset, but also understanding -- if sex is a component of your relationship and you two can't compromise on something that works in the bedroom, then i think it would be valid to split with your partner in an effort to find someone with which you're more compatible.\n  \n  sex isn't everything in a relationship, but it is important to some, if not most, people. and if sex is important to you then you need a partner who's on the same page as you.\n

drive, it's difficult to really get in the mood to have sex. to have sex when you don't want to is practically rxpe.\n  \n  i understand the situation is frustrating, but she isn't doing this

much.\n  ","417598":"\n  i'm most proud of my boyfriend and best friend -- they've both overcome significant struggles in their lives and are hard working individuals. they've never let anything get

currently thrown into a corner of my room & i really don't feel like organizing them just to take a photo for an anon who clearly has a boot fetish.\n  ","417607":"\n  contrary to what family means to me, friends mean the world to me. they've been more of a family to me than my family itself, and i'm so grateful for the friendships i've developed over the years.\n  \n  ideally, friends should be loyal to you (and vice versa), be willing to help you when you're struggling, and be a source of comfort and escape when too much is going on. your friends shouldn't sugarcoat things to make you happy & be real with you, and you don't need to talk every day to maintain a friendship. you also have to understand that everyone is living their own life and it doesn't mean the friendship is weak at all.\n  ","417608":"\n  at this point, nothing. i've never developed a strong sense of family because my family has been dysfunctional from when i was a child. i don't have a close relationship with

overwhelming and don't suffocate him, but send him messages telling him that you support him and that you're always there for him. he can talk to you when he's ready and you're not going to leave,

trip for the person who told this to me, and i learned that people are fully capable of loving another person even if they still have issues within themselves.\n  \n  in addition, the idea of a person not being able to love someone else if they don't love themselves is harmful to people who struggle with self worth because it makes them further believe that they're not worthy of love either.\n

affection.\n  ","417977":"\n  people who make false accusations should be met with discipline -- perhaps not as severely as people who actually do the offense, but there should be some form of punishment involved.\n  \n  however, i don't believe dr. ford was lying about kavanaugh.\n  ","417978":"\n  there's nothing in a man that will complete a woman, so the answer is nothing. women are whole human beings and don't need the validation of men to survive & thrive.\n  ","417979":"\n  i have tendencies to be pretty romantic, yes !! i prefer staying inside, having deep conversations, and connecting intimately with my partner as opposed to going out somewhere. i really value sentimental thoughts and gifts more than anything else.\n  ","417980":"\n  i'm purposely staying out of it because it's a sensitive topic for me. i don't like discussing abxse on my page, it can be triggering at times.\n  ","417981":"\n  i think it's absolutely disgusting. rxpe is a serious offense and is incredibly traumatic for survivors, and to lie and make false claims of rxpe is so demeaning and a spit in the face to those who have actually endured that trauma.\n  ","417982":"\n  welcome to my page, which is hella gay.\n  ","417983":"\n  i feel things too deeply, so i feel as if breaking someone else's heart would personally be easier for me. i have a tendency to ruminate on things for a long time, and normally if i'm breaking a person's heart, i've already disconnected from them emotionally so it wouldn't hurt me as much as if i got my heart broken.\n  ","417984":"\n  it depends on their personality. i have a friend who's pretty talkative, but she's also fun to talk to so it doesn't bother me at all.\n  \n  other people, however, are irritating when they speak too much.\n

ideas, it's been a pretty relaxing day.\n  ","417989":"\n  no, i haven't purchased it yet. i want to read more reviews and watch more streams of people playing it to determine if it's a good investment.\n  \n  it's on sale for $35 on amazon rn, but i also don't know if someone already bought it for me as an xmas gift, so i might hold off until after the holidays.\n  ","417990":"\n  i

sports.\n  ","417996":"\n  i play mostly RPG and FPS, depending on the individual game. i don't like big multiplayer FPS games, but i do enjoy FPS's that have a solo (or co-op) storyline, like destiny

everything happens for a reason because unfair things happen to good people and unjust people often get away with their problematic behavior.\n  ","418001":"\n  i can't really give you an answer because i don't know your specific situation nor the relationship you had with your ex.\n  \n  however, i will say this in a general sense -- you have to remember that you did break up for a reason, and unless you have reasonable cause to believe that the relationship will be different now, the turnout may end up being the same. most of the time, it isn't worth it to return to your exes because you both might be hurt again in the long run.\n  \n  but like i said, i don't know your exact situation. use your best judgment.\n  ","418002":"\n  i'm debating on it !! i need to look into it more

take ibuprofen, and it's the worst in the morning, so idk if i need a new pillow or something.\n  ","418008":"\n  this is day three of me waking up in immense pain to the point where i'm in tears. i

anything redeeming about them anymore.\n  ","418014":"\n  no, quite the opposite. ever since he took office, more and more racist, sexist,homophobic, transphobic, etc etc. people are coming out and

the circumstance. some people have easy lives while other people have harder lives. it isn't really a universal thing.\n  ","418016":"\n  in a way, yeah -- although when i say that they've done something wrong, it isn't usually something as easy as a silly mistake. it usually happens when they've made a big mistake or have wronged someone (whether it's myself or someone i know), and then all i can see in them are their flaws, which are unforgiving.\n  ","418017":"\n  idk i'd rather come back as something simple and peaceful, like a tree in the woods or a flake of snow.\n  ","418018":"\n

general public, particularly in retail or food service positions, and unfortunately saying \"that's just me\" in response to something you might have done that offends a customer won't fly with management and may risk your job.\n  \n  personally speaking, if a customer is acting irrationally and heated and making personal offenses toward the workers, then it's forgiveable to defend yourself against the customer. you have to remind others that you're human too. but that doesn't give anyone permission to personally criticize a customer because then you're acting just as poorly as the

as to how i was still so nice to them.\n  \n  same thing with my boyfriend. he's a very blunt, honest, no bullshit sort of person but he's been working in retail for years now, particularly in

general public as much as i can.\n  \n  however, i try not to avoid problems because that only makes them worse in the long run.\n  ","418136":"\n  probably, but i can't remember specifics. i've only ever really drifted away from people, and i wouldn't be surprised if it was my fault.\n  ","418137":"\n  yeah, unfortunately that's very common when people move in together for the first time. it can

be a beautiful, selfless human being on a daily basis.\n  ","418150":"\n  it depends entirely on the mistake they made and if the apology was sincere. i'm more likely to forgive minor transgressions,

and power in most countries.\n  ","418156":"\n  i always feel a deep yearning or emptiness when i have to clean the mug cabinet and get rid of mugs that i haven't used in a while. i always regret getting rid of them because i have a really bad mug obsession, and i want to keep every one i see.\n  ","418157":"\n  pretty much anything having to do with driving and dealing with other drivers on the road.\n  \n  i don't get road rage per say, but it *really* bothers me when people are in such a rush that they don't pay attention to what's around them, or they simply don't care. cutting others off, not using blinkers, passing in the right lane, honking obnoxiously, etc etc.\n  ","418158":"\n  i'm not afraid of attachment, and i actually become attached to people incredibly easy -- sometimes to the point where it's unhealthy. i'll develop an irrational adoration for them, up until they do something that i think is wrong.\n  \n  when that happens, i can detach myself from people incredibly easily, but it often turns into some form of distaste or dislike for them.\n  ","418159":"\n  my day has been fine. two of my coworkers surprised me with gifts for my birthday -- a mug and a $15

noun, but i can be intelligent about certain things.\n  ","418167":"\n  not at all. i always take extremely hot showers.\n  ","418168":"\n  the one i identify with most is probably gluttony -- i don't have much self control, especially when it comes to drinking.\n  \n  the one i identify with least would be greed. i'm not greedy by any means and i would rather give my money away (in terms of gift giving because it makes people having) since money can always be made again.\n  ","418169":"\n  regardless of what you say, they're going to feel hurt and pain either way. therefore, it's best to just

would make me extremely self conscious.\n  ","418175":"\n  in most cases, it isn't medically necessary. it's essentially genital mutilation, and it has become so normalized in society that people are under the false impression that it's safer than to not be circumcised.\n  \n  there's also the idea that infants cannot give consent, and to medically alter someone's body (in most cases for aesthetic appeal) without consent is wrong.\n  ","418176":"\n  LOL. don't worry, i figured it was you.\n  ","418177":"\n  rofl, maybe. some people are so salty over the most random things, so it wouldn't surprise me.\n  ","418178":"\n  we'll text, but normally our schedules were so conflicting that we were hardly able to see each other. when i get into bad moods, i also don't tend to use my phone very

birthday today, and i'm fortunate in that i didn't end up falling into a bad mood. sometimes my birthday makes me depressed, but this weekend was actually great.\n  ","418180":"\n  when they don't want to wear makeup anymore.\n  \n  sometimes people wear makeup their entire life, sometimes people never wear makeup, and sometimes people stop wearing makeup because they don't want to wear it anymore. it's circumstantial.\n  ","418181":"\n  i only prefer the company of my boyfriend when i'm in a bad mood because he's the only person who can really comfort me.\n  \n  if he's not around, then i prefer to be left alone.\n  ","418182":"\n  my birthday was good !! i got a few gift cards from my brother and cousin, but my main birthday gift was tickets to see harry potter & the cursed

they have hints of red and orange.\n  ","418185":"\n  i don't generally go to the movies as it is, so i never have. plus the movie theaters around me are super expensive, i'd rather just wait for them

i'll get something in the wrong size on accident, but it hasn't been a big deal because it still fit me.\n  ","418205":"\n  yeah, i volunteered in the past. my boyfriend and i used to volunteer for a local children's basketball tournament held at his church. we would sell different drinks and candy for the kids and parents, and the proceeds would go towards a scholarship.\n  ","418206":"\n  LOL, no. i've actually never dyed my hair green before.\n  ","418207":"\n  no, i haven't done that in years because i can't handle the crowds of people. i might check out some online deals on cyber monday,

as opposed to the few jobs themselves.\n  \n  i never add things that aren't true, though. that's setting yourself up for disappointment because you may be hired based on an untrue skill, and then you pretty much have no idea what you're doing and may put your job at risk.\n  ","418211":"\n  it's always good to follow up with the company a few days to a week after submitting your application. it

a falling out with them ?? it's disrespectful.\n  ","418224":"\n  no, not at all. just because you're not friends with a person anymore doesn't mean that it's okay to reveal their secrets that they confided in you. to tell other people their secrets would be a significant betrayal.\n  ","418225":"\n  my boyfriend is one of the most selfless people i know. he always sacrifices his own comfort and

giving the artist free reign over what they want to do in terms of style and color. i usually give my artist a general idea of what i want, and i let her draw up something using her own creativity.\n

different scenario. i would stay with him in that case.\n  ","418317":"\n  exactly. any person who uses the whole \"friendzone\" thing as an excuse is likely insecure & immature af, because they can't accept the fact that someone doesn't want to date them.\n  \n  not everyone is going to want to date you, let alone even like you in the first place. to get offended over someone saying no to you is silly, just move on like everyone else.\n  ","418318":"\n  it would depend entirely on the reason why he went to jail. the concept of him going to jail by itself isn't a make-or-break decision, because there are a lot of bullsh*t reasons why someone can be sent to jail.\n  \n  however, if it was something alarming and horrible, like r*pe or p*dophilia, then i would break up with him instantly.\n  ","418319":"\n  no, i don't bother with new years resolutions at all. in the past, i always broke them within the first month anyway, lol.\n  \n  if i want to make a new resolution, then realistically i can start it at any time. waiting for the new year is just giving yourself an excuse to postpone the changes you need to make. if you really set your mind to making a change, there's nothing stopping you from beginning those changes now.\n  ","418320":"\n  technically, all of the men in my life are in the \"friendzone\" because i'm in a relationship already.\n  \n  the \"friendzone\" is just a bullsh*t excuse that men give when a woman rejects their advances, though. there's really no \"friendzone,\" you just have to learn to accept the meaning of no if someone doesn't want to date you.\n  ","418321":"\n  you're welcome !! if you have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n  ","418322":"\n  unfortunately, i've had to deal with death often in my life, referring to both people and animals.\n  \n  i put up a strong front at the wake and funeral services, but i have a tendency to break down in private after everything has calmed down. the last time i witnessed a death, i didn't cry in the waiting room because i felt like i had to be a source of strength for everyone else, but as soon as we got home, i broke down.\n  ","418323":"\n  i don't have a preference. i don't really like receiving flowers as a gift, even though i do appreciate the sentiment behind them. artificial flowers obviously last longer, but real flowers are usually prettier. it doesn't much matter to me.\n  ","418324":"\n  no, i don't. i don't generally like xmas as a holiday, but i *do* enjoy buying and giving people gifts to open on the holidays.\n  \n  i haven't even started xmas shopping yet, though. i need to pay off some of my credit cards, and then i'll probably start shopping in 1-2 weeks.\n  ","418325":"\n  the person you asked is correct -- you're referring to the people in that construction, so it should go \"...who share the same interests.\"\n  \n  if the noun you were referring to was a thing, you could use \"that.\" i.e. \"i like to collect toys that remind me of my childhood.\"\n  ","418326":"\n  right now, i have 2,391 coins.\n  ","418327":"\n  i think some celebrities are attractive, but it doesn't go anywhere further than that, lol.\n  \n

just don't know if the rest of his family is going to be around.\n  ","418329":"\n  no, i never got suspended from school before. i was a quiet, low-key student when i was a teenager and i never got into trouble. school was pretty much a safe haven for me.\n  ","418330":"\n  there's a lot of disregard for new wave feminists in online communities, and i don't feel comfortable adhering the label of \"feminist\" to myself because unfortunately people didn't take me seriously when i prefaced my opinions with the idea that i was a feminist. white and liberal feminism is pretty much the face of feminism these days, and their core beliefs don't define what i believe or what i am. i don't want to associate myself with that form of the movement.\n  \n  i still have many of the same beliefs as i did when i labeled myself as an intersectional feminist, but i just don't throw the label around anymore.\n  ","418331":"\n  absolutely not. if your relationship is based exclusively on money, then your relationship is empty and foundation-less. there's so much more that goes into relationships than how each partner handles their finances. in my opinion, it's pretty shallow to date someone *solely* because they make a lot of money.\n  ","418332":"\n  i haven't watched a horror movie since i was a teenager, so i don't really have any idea. most horror movies scare me a lot and make my paranoia worse, especially if i watch them alone, so i avoid them at this point.\n  ","418333":"\n  i don't recall my childhood, so i can't objectively say whether or not that part of my life was good or bad. i simply can't remember anything prior to the age of 11\/12.\n  \n  my teenagehood was extremely difficult, and if it wasn't for the support of two specific friends, i wouldn't have survived. i endured a lot of abvse, which has even altered my behavior as an adult.\n  \n  after the age of 20 and beyond, my life has been substantially better. i've had good opportunities and i've worked my

grow, and it's often our love for others that motivates us to continue pushing forward.\n  \n  however, it's also important to be loved because we deserve to feel loved, cared for, and appreciated --

i got a better grip on my mental health, thanks to therapy & finding the right combination of medication.\n  \n  i still have panic attacks, but perhaps one every two or three months. in 2017, especially early 2017, it would be at least once per week. i also haven't had a severe depressive episode in months, and my mood swings are very seldom and not as extreme as they used to be.\n  ","418420":"\n  mainly because this is one of my favorite movies.\n  ","418421":"\n  LOL.\n  \n  because that's just what we did when we were younger. it wasn't a stranger exactly, it was an acquaintance's house, but that was during a time in my life where we would give any excuse to party.\n  ","418422":"\n  this anon is *so* angry for no legitimate reason, lmao.\n  \n  friendships

you're from the same generation as me, lmao. how old are you ??\n  ","418427":"\n  there's nothing i wish to change. there's nothing wrong with not sugar coating things, especially when it comes to

that my memory is fine, aren't you ??\n  \n  i wish i had a better memory. it sucks sometimes to have no idea what people are talking about because you can't remember previous conversations, or the obvious fact that i can't recall my entire childhood.\n  ","418431":"\n  i'm not answering any more questions about this dude.\n  ","418432":"\n  it's been at least five times, but i obviously can't

but i can work at my own pace (which is fast anyway).\n  \n  working under stress leads to a greater chance for mistakes, and i can't risk that at my job.\n  ","418436":"\n  no, not really. my only tradition is that i always unintentionally wait until the last second to buy gifts for people, LOL.\n  ","418437":"\n  i would write that i'm living in a nice apartment with my boyfriend, we're both happy at our jobs, and we have a cute dog to take care of.\n  ","418438":"\n  within the last few years, it was making the decision to leave my last job and start a new job (my current job).\n  \n  i was stressed out beyond belief at my last job and would cry every day, but i was terrified of the prospect of starting a new job because of the unknown of how it will be. i decided to go for it anyway, and i'm really happy with the outcome. i'm not nearly as stressed out as i was one year ago.\n  ","418439":"\n  my boyfriend and i were having sxx & doing drugs at some random person's house

opinion.\n  ","418447":"\n  my memory is pretty bad, and there's no rhyme or reason behind why i remember some things and forget others. i think the only reason why i remember the whole frank zappa

even recall. i have memories of playing crash bandicoot, so i assume i played spyro as well.\n  \n  i think the remastered version is a brilliant idea, though. not only does it bring back nostalgia

into deeper things.\n  ","418454":"\n  this is an incredibly open-ended question, and it would be impossible for me to list everything that's wrong in the world at the moment.\n  \n  climate change has been wrecking havoc on the earth. so little people are being brought to justice for crimes they've committed. the media has brainwashed most people into focusing on insignificant events while ignoring larger events. social media has taken over people's lives to the point where everyone feels entitled. there's rampant ableism in today's society when it comes to physical & mental disabilities, and a lot of it is so ingrained in our culture that most people aren't even aware it exists.\n  ","418455":"\n  i'm 50-50 on this -- on the one hand, i see a lot of progression in terms of science and technology. however, in terms of social reform, i feel as if the world (or, at the very least, the united states) has halted.\n  \n  the midterm elections have given me a little bit of
