I mean it\u2019s very important to build trust with the person you\u2019re in a relationship with long distance but it can be hard because you never know what they can be doing. Trust is so important to have when you\u2019re in a relationship and if you don\u2019t have that then there\u2019s really no relationship between the two of you. I mean it takes time to build trust by not only their words but also their actions and if they show you, you can trust them then you\u2019ll start to slowly be able to trust that person and not have to worry about them doing other things behind your back. But then on the other hand if they show you, you can\u2019t trust them due to their actions and how they present themselves to you that\u2019s a whole different story. But one factor in to why long distance relationships don\u2019t work out is trust. You gotta have trust with the other person and slowly build it.\n  \n  The other factor would definitely be communication. I mean obviously if it\u2019s long distance there\u2019s going to be different time zones like you might be 3 hours behind and the person you\u2019re with might be 3 hours ahead of you but that doesn\u2019t mean anything if they really like you, they will communicate with you and talk to you and find the time to do so. No one is ever to \u201cbusy\u201d to communicate with someone they really want and like. No matter how busy someone is they will find the time to communicate with you. People are busy but if they like you, they\u2019ll call or text you. We make time for what we want. Communication is always key because if you don\u2019t communicate with one another the partner can start to overthink and start to worry and you never want that, it\u2019s not healthy. It\u2019s important to always find the time to message one another no matter what. Keeping the communication alive is what is important in long distance relationships even in any relationship.\n  \n  Also another factor can be physical and showing affection. Obviously if you\u2019re in a long distance relationship you can\u2019t touch one another or show affection. That would be very difficult to do. Many people love holding hands, cuddling, kissing, sleeping next to each other, hugging, etc. And in long distance relationships you can\u2019t do that so you can only really use your words to say what you would like to do with one another when you meet. That\u2019s also why long distance relationships don\u2019t work out. It\u2019s craving one another\u2019s touch and feeling that affection.\n  \n  I mean don\u2019t get me wrong there\u2019s many long distance relationships that do work out because they\u2019re able to trust one another and communicate and plus build that strong emotional connection and feel those positive vibes off of one another. That strong connection that you can build with someone in a long distance relationship is quite amazing. Just being able to feel how strong of a connection you two have emotionally and mentally is always great.\n  ","964267":"\n  Yes I have celebrity crushes!\n  ","964268":"\n  We aren\u2019t together anymore anon.\n  ","964269":"\n  Nope, I become very stressed out actually\n  ","964270":"\n  When someone remembers the small details I tell them\n  \n  When someone treats me with respect\n  \n  When someone goes out of their way to communicate with me and tell me about their day and how they\u2019re doing\n  \n  When someone shows me how much they love me and care about me\n  \n  Etc.. \ud83d\ude01\n  ","964271":"\n  No I\u2019ve never fallen in love with a guy that was in another relationship.
