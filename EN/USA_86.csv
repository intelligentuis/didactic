Like if you were my girl I would treat you way better than I would treat my kids like I would see you everyday and spend good money on you and make sure that you are okay and happyüòä.
  ","
  It's sad how they don't want anything to do with them. You'd think they'd want to be in their life somehow. If the parents agreed to not pay child support then that would be understandable. If it was mandatory by the courts then yes, that's bad. What are they scared of? What if the kid wants nothing to do with you when/if you had a change of heart? Could even make an account just for the kid to use when older instead of the other parent being in charge of the money.. not knowing where it goes.
  
  I wouldn't want that for myself. What if I had a kid, they'd most likely pull the same move then too. Time with the kid(s) is better than money. There's even video calls or sending cards instead of being 100% a deadbeat dad. Why have kids if not mature enough to help out, stick around? I'd rather know that a small amount of money was going towards helping them instead of the guy ""spending good money on me"". I'd just feel guilty that they spent stuff on me but too lazy to do that with their blood.

  ""Whataboutism, also known as whataboutery, is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument.

  "
461706,"
   Let me introduce you to another term: whataboutism. Do you know what it means?
  ","
  I don't need to disprove anything that others write to me. I know the truth of the matter. They can have opinions- but what they've been saying goes way past that. They name call when they don't get the answers they want etc that's not showing opinions or debating the topics at hand. They purposely dragged my name into it instead of simply asking if ""its cheating or not if a single girl was with someone that was taken"". They sent me about 5 different answers to that question as well. .
  
  Even when I do prove them wrong, they still don't listen and solely focus on one thing.
  "
461707,"
   Or am I wrong?
  ","
  Pretty much. Can see the bad in it.
  
  It's not so black & white though regardless of what Reachel, that anon and others say. I'm past justifying it. They only focus on him having the gf. They say things to me and then backtrack when they notice the double standards in what they just wrote too. Nonstop saying the same things instead of anything new. Claim its holding someone accountable when it doesn't concern them at all etc they just like bitching, creating drama, having me on their mind when they could actually be doing something else with their time and effort. When the talk about him/them doesn't get to me they jump on the racist card. I don't tell others how to live their life, do with their body and all that but they pounce on that shit ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

  I'm not afraid of being judged. Calling me names says more about them than myself or what I do/dont do. Calling names isn't an opinion. Talking about me just shows attention when they could literally be doing anything else with their time.

  IV needles went in wrong or something so she had both arms black&blue from that.
  
  They ended up giving her another contraction inducing pill and she felt fine with that one. Wasn't working though..They were going to let them come back to the house and then right after saying that Jack's heartbeat stopped. Made her crawl around on the floor trying to get it back and stuff.
  
  Had to do a c section after all that. She was avoiding it lol
  
  She couldn't breathe at one point afterwards. They thought she had Corona. So she didn't even get to see him at that point. She had pneumonia and he ended up having an infection too. Also jaundice so he had to be in a uv thing. The results for covid came back negative so got to see him a bit and then finally he got to be in the same room as them.

  You don't know him, his thoughts, what he's done to show he cares but yet still writing stuff like this. I'm not regretting that he's ""the only guy I can get irl"". Yes, him having someone else isn't ideal but it is what it is.
  
  Even if he was single you guys would be putting doubts there. You just don't like seeing anyone happy. Anyone doing things outside their normal beliefs. Probably pissed its not with you or that I haven't been sharing lately. With good reason since I usually get this type of shit to read about XD

  Hell no. Rather not. It's an old man's name anyways
  
  Yes but it would be funny as the nephew's uncle has the same name as him so technically there'd be a 3rd. Bit more confusing! Better be a different spelling of both ü§£
  
  One is outdated and the other is common.. maybe the more common one.
  
  Would be a little weird. My brother-in-law's brother shares the same name as him. As for the cousin I don't see.. that's another common name. I'd be fine with former stepcousins names as those are pretty common too
  
  Sure.. only two of them.. the 3rd one has more of a unique name.

  ","
  True, true.

462489,"
   What should a man do if is a relationship and they are arguing and the women hits him? And what about if it‚Äôs the other way around what should the women do?
  ","
  How about be the bigger person? Let them vent out the frustrations (assuming they aren't really trying to hurt you?), listen to them, walk away, take a step back, cool down. Breathe. I suppose it depends on the reason why too. Be honest with them. Be understanding (again situation based lol)
  
  The women should get the fuck out because its just going to keep repeating the cycle. Obviously if the man keeps getting hit then same for him. That's not real love, my dudes
  "
462490,"
   I mean that‚Äôs a little bit more serious if their is a kid watching it they should have put him in the next room or something then continue their business.But I mean if it‚Äôs like a one or two time thing it should be forgiven since love can sometimes be painful and messy but it‚Äôs worth fighting for.
  ","
  Creepy condoning violence.
  
  Seems like mental illness, addiction and other such problems would be a factor then. I'd rather not be with someone that would lay a hand on me regardless of the circumstances. I've had people I'm close with that have been in those situations, it can only get worse.

462493,"
   What‚Äôs the right age to get married?
  ","
  When you find someone you can't live without, right timing, divine intervention, financial stability, true love. I don't think age truly plays a part.. just whenever it feels 100% right.
  "
462494,"
   That‚Äôs okay and all I guess from your perspective but for example what if it is confirmed that a girl was trying to finesse a guy for the bands, then she caught him with his manz, is it okay then to show her them hands and teach her some respect and manners ?
  ","
  Not really sure what you mean by the ""bands""
  
  I don't think it's right to hit people. There's obviously a reason why she did something.. lacking in the relationship. Hitting someone wont make them want to keep staying with you. It doesn't show them love or that you truly care about them. Being dominated in the bedroom and being with a pos guy is very different.
  
  Literally saw a tik tok vid on IG earlier where this guy hit his girlfriend/wife on the legs. They had a young son and the son watched him hit her and then hit him over the head for hitting his mom. The kid is obviously learning bad behavior regardless if he stuck up for the mother.

  It shouldn't have to? You can have disagreements without getting physical. Talk like adults, use words, understanding, feel safe with the person.

It was just such a shit night lol she actually married him because she got pregnant a few years later, divorced since he was cheating.

   Would you be able to live without sugar?
  ","
  Everything has sugar in it. I'm still getting sugar while doing keto. More natural sugar by fruits. The sugar count is just less than what a typical person would eat. Doesn't mean I'm not getting any. Having less sugar and carbs also helps my pcos, insulin resistance and fatty liver.
  
  I still have times where I've had ""bad foods"" but it's been more one meal, not killing the whole day.
  
  Could transition to low carb as well at times. Which has higher carbs than keto but still fairly low too.

  Ofcourse. Situations would be very different. I just wouldn't want to do it with that guy. It's totally bizarre how he can't take no and wont leave me alone about other stuff too. He makes a bunch of accounts like Ben has  -_-

  "
463041,"
   You have to tell me the story about this dude cause I am confused?
  ","
  He's from Lahore hence the nickname I gave. Shaam is his real name.
  
  This is one of my top answers where he's featured. He's been harassing me for years now. About getting a green card, his dad's steel company, other girls he likes, drinking mango of milkshakes, gives pointless updates to his day. Says he wants to do better and be better but hasn't taken any steps to better himself. Likes calling me Alice and Naan. No idea why those names either. I've only ever been myself here. Says rude crap at times about me not being good enough and other type things.
  
  Why would anyone want to marry him, give him a chance?
  
  He'll take breaks and then go right back to being annoying again. He's way worse than Ben to me.

There are times we forget our value as a person because we are so blinded with these thoughts of loneliness, emptiness and ego. Somewhere along the road we become numbed with all the frustrations and dissatisfaction. But life itself isn't always about darkness and sadness, Life is also filled with colors and that makes it beautiful. Along this path of darkness there's always light waiting to be seen by our daunted hearts. Our heart is gifted to see this light. It may be hiding behind those circumstances that we encounter; in a stranger we just met at an unexpected place; a family who has been always there but you just ignored because of your imperfect relationship with them; it might be a long time friend you have or a friend you just met. Open your heart and you will see how blessed you are to have them all in your life. Sometimes they are the light that shines your path in some dark phases of life. Don't lose hope.""

  Not knowing the person that much. I can come off as shy but sizing them up. Resting b!tch face and being bigger doesn't help my case either.
  
  If they are really interested or just want something that night...
  
  Sharing information when it might not come to anything in the long run
  
  Not feeling a connection and being stuck there on the date
  
  Sharing too much/too little
  
  The mindset of the date in general

Criticism is usually a method of helping someone see a different view.. that's not what this person is doing. Even keep bringing racism into it when it literally has nothing to do with anything here.

  It wasn't good to begin with. Toxic, ab*se, lost feelings, the feelings weren't there to begin with, found someone else. Realized they weren't fully compatible. They dont know what they want. Scared of commitment or getting hurt. Already had someone and trying to be that person for them. Wasn't a real relationship to begin with. Lies. Broken hearted.
  
  Plenty of things can make a relationship die or not go anywhere.

   As a follow up to my last question, seeing as the tone of these protests seems to be very anti police, do you think the police who have requested people don't rally in London today, or at least clear the streets by 5pm, should take a backseat & let right & left wingers battle it out Purge style? üëä
  ","
  I don't think I got the other question (I've been deleting things from Ben but this seems different to me?)
  
  I don't think violence should be met with violence. On the people protesting, on the cops. It just adds more hatred and mayhem, even more deaths lost when it could have been saved.
  
  All for voices being heard. There definitely needs to be a change! There have been a few with the police departments here already.

  Honey isn't bad but rather get pet names from a partner instead of random online people.
  
  Sis is just creepy after writing something like that.
  
  I'm not that old yet. I don't view it as being respectful. Especially when I tell people not to say that and they still do! I have a name for a reason....

   Yeah I've nothing. I mean I dont have a big house, expensive cars & clothes like them. But I have what they dont. I have what the great souls of our country gave me. I have self confidence, I have truth, I have hope, I have decency. You can expect results & hardwork from me. I think I'm right.

  What's the truth?
