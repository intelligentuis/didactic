comforting , lol .","310801":"we have similar views for the most part , with the exception of a few minor issues here and there . however , it doesn t interfere with our relationship at all . the only issue that we strongly disagree on is circumcision , but that s not something we ll have to worry about for years . my boyfriend also likes playing the devil s advocate when it comes to talking about issues , i . e . he ll advocate for a position he doesn t necessarily believe in just to challenge my viewpoints and come to an understanding of why i feel a certain way .","310802":"i think it all comes down to a matter of self esteem . if you re happy with yourself then you wouldn t feel the need to compare yourself with others . the desire to be better than another person insinuates that you re not happy with yourself , and you want the validation of knowing that you re better than another person to boost your own ego . there s nothing inherently wrong with that because it s just part of human nature , though . but it may become a problem if it starts interfering in your everyday life or causes rifts in your relationships . eventually , you ll reach a point where you re content with your own achievements and you won t feel the need to be in competition with other people .","310803":"during my free time , i enjoy answering questions on askfm , reading a book , watching netflix , and playing video games . i ve also been overwhelmed with the desire to see my friends whenever i have an opportunity to do so i ve been much more social over the past few months compared to the past , and i m not exactly sure why . however , the reason why i enjoy performing those activities is because they re a form of escapism from my everyday life . i can easily escape into a novel , into a video game , into a tv show , etc etc . as for askfm , i enjoy answering questions about myself because it forces me to have introspection and think critically about my life and the choices i ve made .","310804":"childhood trauma .","310805":"we were years old at the time . please note that i definitely don t recommend dating at that age i was far too young to start dating and relationships are a lot to handle when you re years old , especially on top of puberty and other stressors in life . the reason why we dated so young is because we were both introduced to concepts of attraction at a morbidly young age , and we also confided in each other regarding our traumas which solidified our bonds .","310806":"cont i feel pathetic too bc i can barely walk to places by mtself like stores bc anxiety . . and ik ! ! this sounds dumb but idk how to clean . like i kbow how but its not the right way so i feel pathetic . . tbh nobody really knows how to do this stuff until they re thrown into adulthood and are somehow expected to know how to behave as an adult . schools don t give adequate lessons on how to do things like open a bank account , apply for a job , pay for bills , clean a house , etc etc . it s entirely all right for you to not know how to do these things because nobody is ever really taught how . but it ll all come in time . if you have a parental figure who can help you , that helps a lot as well . i ve always had really bad anxiety especially when it comes to public places , so i understand where you re coming from . when the time comes for you to learn how to do these things , the opportunities will present themselves .","310807":"i would never touch a computer powered device ever again . human touch is vital to our life force and strength it makes us feel less alone , it nourishes us spiritually , and it provides comfort where words can sometimes lack . i require a lot of intimacy in my relationship , so i wouldn t be able to live without the power of human touch .","310808":"lmao if this is in response to what dovbts said , then you re quite the funny one .","310809":"talkig about my emotions with my boyfriend and best friend . it feels nice to be validated or to gain their approval , even after all this time . i still think the world of them , and it boggles my mind why in the hell they ve decided to stick around me for so long . cuddling also brings me great comfort , but i m only comfortable cuddling with my boyfriend i despise physical touch from anyone else . it makes me feel safe .","310810":"for me personally , it would depend entirely upon who i was speaking with about my flaws . for example , i wouldn t be offended if i was talking to my boyfriend or my best friend about my flaws and they happened to agree with me because i know they would be coming from a good and honest place . however , if it was anyone else , i would likely be offended because that person likely doesn t know me in that fashion and it would feel as if they were judging me .","310811":"aw , thank you","310812":"it s simply easier for me , especially when i m on my laptop like right now . i don t really care about how my writing looks when i m doing something as casual as answering questions on askfm . although i do capitalize things on other social media like twitter and fb , it just looks more organized on those platforms .","310813":"somewhat , yes . i feel as if modern feminist movements have somewhat backfired on themselves because it s seen more as a fashion trend as opposed to what it should be , which is a radical movement towards equality . people like to brand themselves with feminist ideology without putting the work in to actually make a difference in other people s lives , as if throwing the word feminist in your twitter bio makes you a better person than everyone else . this isn t to say that there aren t wonderful feminists in the world , though . there are dozens of people who follow feminist movements and are genuinely doing good for themselves and for other oppressed groups , but often their voices are silenced in favor of people who would rather make a lot of noise as opposed to moving forward .","310814":"considering i m actually a decent human being and care about the welfare of others , yes .","310815":"honestly , it makes me think that people have inner motives for buying things off of someone s wishlist , i . e . they want something in return like offering nvdes for wishlist items , things of that nature . i ve bought items off of my friends wishlists , but it was never anonymously and it was because i genuinely care about my friends and want them to be happy . i ve bought quite a few things for my askfm friends , in fact .","310816":"i can be my true self around my boyfriend and my best friend , and that s only because i ve been extremely close with them for numerous years and have eventually gotten to the point where i know they ll accept me and love me regardless of what i do within reason , i suppose . it s difficult for me to be myself around most other people , however , and that s mainly because i don t know which aspect of myself i should project at any given moment . sometimes i feel as if there are multiple facets of my personality that are often contradictory , so it s difficult for me to differentiate between them in regards to how i should behave .","310817":"why do i get the feeling that you re taking these questions straight out of a business handbook ?","310818":"i suppose such items would make it easier to transfer and dispose of a body . i ve obviously been watching too many documentaries on true crime , lol .","310819":"don t become overly attached or clingy to your date on the first night you go out , even if you do develop strong feelings for them it seems extremely desperate and can end up pushing the person away from you . i . e . don t tell them that you love them , you can envision your future together , you want to have children with them , or other borderline creepy things that you wouldn t really discuss unless you were in a long term relationship with someone .","310820":"lol , i obsessively hoard coffee cups mugs . they ve always been an obsession of mine ever since i was a teenager , and i always have the compulsion to purchase them wherever i travel . my family gets so angry with me whenever i bring a new cup home because my shelves are already overflowing with too many mugs .","310821":"waves crashing on the shore , wind rustling through tree branches , the crackling of a burning fire , and piano music .","310822":"it s always been a dream of mine to visit sequoia national park and the grand canyon in the us . they both seem like such beautiful , breath taking places .","310823":"aw thank you , i hope you have a great day as well","310824":"the decaying carcass of an entire seagull . that was certainly an interesting find . the beak and legs were still intact .","310825":"coffee . i won t turn it down if it s offered to me , but i refuse to skimp out on my coffee . it s one of the only simple pleasures i have during the day so i always want my coffee to be strong and bold .","310826":"dealing with my mental health and it s impact upon my ability to do my job .","310827":"you re asking this question to a person with bpd who chronically suffers from wanting to be the embodiment of other people , lol . i constantly envy people and wish to be everything they are because i lack a sense of self identity and self worth . i ve never known who i was , so the most natural course of action for me was to try to mold myself into someone else who i admired .","310828":"continue producing your own work while using the work you see as inspiration . eventually , the work you produce won t be carbon copies of other artists work and will be your own original productions . eventually , you ll find your niche as an artist and discover your style for what it truly is .","310829":"my boyfriend struggles with mental illness , so it s nearly impossible to cheer him up if he s down . the best thing i can do in any circumstance is give him the space he needs and let him know that i m always here to support him , i ll walk to the end of the earth for him , and he isn t a burden on me if he needs anything . the same can be said for me my mental illnesses make it nearly impossible for me to cheer up if i m down , but thankfully he s very understanding of that since he struggles with the same thing . he doesn t take it personally if his attempts at cheering me up fail . and no matter how much i try to push him away , he s always right there to catch me .","310830":"wow , this is probably the most heartfelt and sweetest message i ve ever received . i can t say i agree with your sentiments , but i appreciate you telling me . ?","310831":"welcome back , merecas . ? i would recommend youcuntx , princess tal , lakocis , celinem , and courrtana . they all give wonderful answers and are top notch people .","310832":"my boyfriend is off from work , so we might go to the beach . other than that , i have no plans . i generally don t like celebrating the fourth of july because i have extreme sensitivity to sound and fireworks really freak me out .","310833":"look up stonewall , the gay liberation movement .","310834":"courrtana lakocis youcuntx littlerouge theonlyems all of these people give grade a answers and are worth a follow . ?","310835":"i wouldn t feel comfortable posting a photo of her on askfm without her consent . however , we dated for about a year when we were teenagers and it was an illuminating experience for me because it was my first real relationship .","310836":"there s nothing i dislike about feminism as a whole because the movement is good in essence . however , various practitioners of feminism give feminism the wrong impression and makes it unappealing for a large majority of people . i dislike feminists who refuse to listen to other people s points of view , instead pushing their own agenda . it s healthy to consider all sides of an argument , but there are a select few people who do not do this . i dislike feminists who don t do their own research . an integral part of feminism is backing up your opinions with viable sources , and i ve seen a lot of people refuse to do that , stating that their feelings justify their opinions . i dislike feminists who exclude other oppressed people from their agendas , such as trans people or poc . feminism was started by trans people and poc , and ironically , their voices are often silenced by cis white people who are trying to speak on behalf of feminism .","310837":"this is the first selfie i ve taken in ages so excuse the poorly fabricated snapchat filter .","310838":"nutella is disgusting . starbucks is better than dunkin donuts . pitbulls aren t inherently mean , it s all based upon the environment in which they grew up . it s rude to point out something or make fun of an aspect about a person if they can t fix it in five minutes i . e . an aspect of their body , a lisp , scars , etc . tattoos aren t juvenile or distasteful . they re works of art .","310839":"i think conspiracy theories are interesting but they re not really something i believe to be true . however , i do believe aliens exist if that s considered a conspiracy theory .","310840":"so my friend agreed to go out with me tonight , but i ended up falling asleep in a drunken stupor before she said yes . i feel like an asshole because i promised i would pay for a drink for her , and then i ended up fucking passing out . smh .","310841":"my anxiety gives me a lot of physical symptoms like that , especially in terms of feeling nauseous , getting sweaty and dizzy , my heart rate increases , and it becomes hard for me to breathe . when i have panic attacks , i start hyperventilating and i usually can t calm down . usually i have to find the root of my anxiety and try to talk myself down from it because i know my mental illness is what s causing the physical symptoms . i also used to take ativan or xanax to calm me down , but i stopped taking those .","310842":"i m incredibly sorry that you feel down and sad please know that although i may not answer right away , i m always here to support you and that you re never alone in your struggles . i ve been there more times than i can count , and i can say with certainty that these feelings may eventually come to pass . i hope you re doing well , anon , and i m always here for you .","310843":"i m left handed . always have been my entire life .","310844":"bones , criminal minds , and parks and rec .","310845":"i m intolerant of things like racism , sexism , homophobia , and transphobia . if someone i was hypothetically dating showed any of those traits , then i would probably cease talking to them and lose their number . i don t have room in my life for people who don t enrich it .","310846":"that s the reason why i switched over to drinking straight liquor i need less of it to send me over the moon .","310847":"it s from an anime called nana according to what people have told me ! ! i ve never watched it before but i found this photo on tumblr and thought it resembled me , lol .","310848":"when i was younger , i always assumed that quicksand would have greater significance in my life . it was shown in so many tv shows and movies that i was convinced that i had to learn how to survive in quicksand , as if it s a common occurrence . in my years of living , i ve never once had to worry about stepping into quicksand .","310849":"science has proven that the earth is spherical , and those who refuse to accept that fact are disillusioned by their own erroneous belief systems .","310850":"these days , i m often asking myself what s the point ? what is the significance of the life i m leading ? what s the reason behind why i go through my daily life , enduring a job i dislike just to pay for bills i wish i didn t have ? how did i get myself absorbed into this to routine of monotony ? what is the point of living when it s so difficult for me to get through every day ? what is the point of helping myself when i m still coming home and destroying myself each and every night ?","310851":"i really resent paying for doctor and therapy appointments . my co pays are high because health insurance in the us is a god damn joke , so a significant portion of my paychecks is dedicated towards making sure i don t die .","310852":"the first thing that came to mind was the quote , who loves orange soda ? ? kudos to anyone who knows where it s from and can complete the phrase","310853":"english is my first language , and it would make sense that i would make a lot of grammatical mistakes on askfm because i don t care about my typing on here like i would if i was at work . i probably have a lot of run on sentences because that s the way my mind works at times .","310854":"it would only be rude if you went about it in a rude fashion , if that makes sense . otherwise , i m always open to constructive criticism , especially when it comes to writing and grammar .","310855":"perhaps , but it isn t something i m focused on right now . i want to become independent and have a better grip on my mental health first .","310856":"the anon in question didn t correct their grammar , though they pointed out that it was wrong in a condescending tone . it s fine to correct someone s grammar if you re nice and informative about it especially to people who don t speak english as a first language , but it s rude to assume that someone is of lesser intelligence just because they don t know english .","310857":"i m not here to entertain your notions of life and death , so you can fuck off with your pseudo bullshit . i know what game you re playing and i m not going to stick around just so that you have your entertainment for the evening .","310858":"i m trapped by my own body and experiences freedom is a foreign concept to me , and the only time i feel free is when i m not in the right state of mind . i don t know why any of you are actually friends with me or admire me . i put on a strong front , but i m actually the biggest pile of shit around . i don t want to exist anymore .","310859":"relationship and do a million other things everyday , and i m hella proud of you for pushing on , bless you ? and thank you so much , i missed your lovely ass x this is the sweetest message i ve gotten in a long time , you ve always been so nice to me . i missed you a lot too , and i m looking forward to your answers again ! !","310860":"i haven t had a legitimate crush on someone since i was in high school , lol . i have a partner already , so i have no interest in pursuing anyone else at this time .","310861":"neuroatypical is a term used to describe people who have been diagnosed with mental , developmental , or neurological cognitive disorders neuro meaning the nervous system , and atypical meaning abnormal . the opposite term is neurotypical , which generally refers to people in the general population who do not have any mental , developmental , or neurological cognitive disorders .","310862":"this is completely irrelevant , but my favorite bartender at the bar i frequent is moving so they threw a going away party for him . he rode into the bar on a damn horse . i m dying .","310863":"if by that you mean open minded and willing to look at subjects from all perspectives , then yes .","310864":"blatant racism , sexism , homophobia , or transphobia . i have no tolerance for that sort of behavior , so if i have a friend who has inclinations towards that behavior , then i ll call them out on their actions and show them why it s wrong . i m normally a non confrontational sort of person , but i have zero tolerance for those mindsets .","310865":"it irritates me when people don t put things back where they found them , i . e . someone borrowing one of my highlighters from my highlighter jar , but then throwing it back onto my desk when they re done . it s so insignificant and meaningless , i shouldn t be irritated at it . but i can t help myself it puts me in such a foul mood .","310866":"time has always been a strange concept to me . i lose track of time easily , i have a terrible memory of past events , and my perception of time has always been warped for example , i ll think something happened two months ago when really it was two years ago . however , in light of that , i always feel the notion that i m somehow running out of time because i m already in my mid s and i have no clue how i got here i didn t expect myself to live this long . i always assumed i would die before the age of , yet here i am it s frazzling .","310867":"i wish i was at nyc pride right now . ?","310868":"days , probably . i m not much of a talker in fact , i m more of a listener than anything else . it s hard for me to

experiences on paper . i can only hope that people will find the time to read my essay and use it as inspiration of their own .","310910":"when i was in high school , we used to have to run the mile in minutes or less in order to get a passing grade .","310911":"slashed someone s tires .","310912":"no , i haven t . i ve done a lot of stupid shit during my life , but thankfully i never got caught .","310913":"prolonged childhood trauma , negative reinforcement , and a lack of serotonin .","310914":"creative writing , i . e . fiction writing , non fictional essays , and poetry . i always knew that i wanted to write for a living , and i ve been writing stories since i was a child . i even originally chose a college that specialized in creative writing for my bachelor s degree . i ve taken many creative writing workshops and fiction writing grammar classes , and it s always been something that gave me immense joy and pleasure no matter how much time i put into it .","310915":"i m passionate about writing , animals and the environment , mental health awareness , disability awareness , and creative expression such as the arts . all of these things give me some sort of purpose in life , and whenever i do something in these areas , i feel as if i m truly making a difference .","310916":"i think a better question is what isn t over priced , haha . nearly everything on long island is expensive housing , taxes , utilities , gas , food products unless you shop at a discount store or a place like costco , car payments insurance , etc . right now , my greatest weakness is the price of housing on long island . you can t usually find an apartment to rent that s decent for anything less than month , and that s pushing it . houses are usually , , and sometimes you can find foreclosed properties for , but that means they re in shit condition and you have to spend money to fix them up . right now , my best friend and i are looking for houses to rent for people , since that s the only way we would be able to afford living independently .","310917":"when i used to write creatively , i would get my inspiration from the feeling i would get while i was surrounded by nature , from the strength of my friends and partner , and from inspiring stories that i would read in my spare time . however , that was more than years ago . over the past week , however , i ve been inspired mainly by the stories i ve been reading regarding people s mental health recoveries and their own personal essays regarding their own struggle with illness and recovery . i ve read so many motivational pieces that it s helped me somewhat find my own voice and a method to tell my own story in the hopes of helping other people tell theirs .","310918":"i consider anyone who is younger than me to be a kid , haha .","310919":"hey friends , i m off from work today and i m motivated to finish writing a personal essay about mental health . you guys should ask me some questions in the meantime since my inbox is rather dry","310920":"body shaming in general is a bad idea . other people s bodies aren t your business to comment upon , and most people are self conscious of the way they look regardless if they re skinny or fat . some things are simply better left unsaid , no matter how strong your feelings are .","310921":"i wouldn t ever go on a blind date if i was single , no . i m too hypervigilant and paranoid to consider the idea of meeting with a person whom i don t know , simply because i wouldn t know who they are , what they could do to me , where they re taking me , etc . perhaps it s a bit extreme for me to think of blind dates in that sort of context , but it s something that has always made me feel uncomfortable .","310922":"it isn t necessarily new technology because i m sure it s been around for a while , but i ve been obsessed with a website called medium . com . it s essentially a website for writers to give them a means of expressing themselves , and it s filled with people s personal essays , short stories , and poetry on a variety of topics . they have a category solely for discussing mental health , and the non fictional essays i ve been reading in that category have been inspiring me to tell my own story .","310923":"for the first time in years , i have the motivation and inspiration to write creatively and tell my story to those willing to listen . i m currently in the process of writing an article about how my mental illness treatment has helped me find my voice as a writer .","310924":"i have a really bad habit of deleting everything about a person once i ve removed them from my life blocking them on social media , deleting pictures and conversations , etc . it s relieving to finally lift that weight off of your shoulders , especially if that person was toxic to you . just keep living your life . the best thing you can do is continue moving forward and focusing your energy on yourself and on people who enrich your life .","310925":"no . i m pro choice , and if someone wants to have an abortion , then they should be allowed to decide what to do with their own body . it isn t my place to judge a person who s making a personal decision for themselves .","310926":"yes i m not a perfect human being , and i m capable of feeling resentment and jealousy just like everybody else . this is something i recently spoke about with my therapist , in fact . the truth is , it s unrealistic to compare our lives milestones with the milestones of other people . everyone walks their own path on this earth , and we all hit milestones at different points not because some people are better than others , but simply because our lives are unique and unfold in different ways . feeling resentment or jealousy because others have advanced quicker than you is a useless and damaging emotion to have because it doesn t help in advancing you personally in your goals . the best thing you can do in these circumstances is to try to feel happy for these people for achieving what they have and using their achievements as motivation to do better .","310927":"abnormal is a strange word because i don t particularly believe that it s uncommon for people to hate their families quite the contrary , in fact . however , perhaps damaging or detrimental is a more appropriate word to use . if you re having violent thoughts about harming your family , then perhaps at that point , you should seek some professional help to guide you in understanding why you feel the way you do and to possibly make amends with your family .","310928":"i think the fire in london is tragic , and more work should have been done ahead of time to prevent it from happening . from my understanding , there was a coalition of people who insisted that there were safety hazards in the apartment building , but the landlord didn t listen . regardless of why it happened , i still think that this tragedy is saddening and my heart goes out to all of the people affected by this incident .","310929":"i like using products from e . l . f . because they re cruelty free , high quality , and inexpensive . i have their volume plumping mascara , and it seems to work fairly well for me .","310930":"yes , they can . depression comes and goes in waves , and it also exists on a spectrum . just because you re diagnosed with depression doesn t mean you re completely incapable of feeling joy . however , don t allow these periods of joy to misguide you those who are depressed are still in need of mental health treatment when they re willing and able , and periods of contentment doesn t mean you re disqualified from receiving help .","310931":"i prefer winter i love the holiday season , the look and smell of freshly fallen snow , seasonal drinks , and cozy fashion trends . i m not a fan of the heat in general which is ironic , considering i live on an island , and i ve always been more accustomed to the cold .","310932":"perhaps you should ask your girlfriend this question and come to an understanding of her feelings instead of asking a bunch of strangers on the internet .","310933":"yes , that sounds pretty ableist to me . depression is often a chronic illness and can only be remedied with a combination of medication and talk therapy . while a lot of components of therapy do take into account that those who are depressed have low self esteem , it s often difficult to reverse what s been ingrained into someone s brain for what is usually years upon years of self hatred .","310934":"my pronouns are they them . i ve also included this information in my bio for anyone interested .","310935":"just one the chinese user who incessantly sends everyone messages at a time in their native tongue that nobody on this side of askfm can understand . i couldn t handle the notifications , so i ended up blocking their account .","310936":"yes , i m currently in love with my partner .","310937":"yes , i was extremely book smart growing up in high school and then eventually in college . i obtained high marks on most of my exams and graduated with a . gpa .","310938":"i m sure i passes hurtful comments and teased people behind their backs when i was a young teenager , but i can t remember any specific instances due to how long ago that was . nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes .","310939":"probably not , it seems like an awfully uncomfortable spot to get a tattoo . i can t imagine how annoying the healing process would be . ?","310940":"more times than i d like to admit .","310941":"this is your relationship and i don t know the nature of it , so i can t tell you what to do . however , it isn t healthy for a relationship to be one sided like that . you should ideally be able to come to compromises with your partner and act as a team , not being in fear and feeling like you re the one who has to apologize even if you re not in the wrong . it could potentially be a red flag , but i don t know what his behavior is like so i don t want to give absolutes .","310942":"i haven t got a clue , to be perfectly honest with you . sometimes i question why my boyfriend is attracted to me because i have a tendency to dwell on the negative aspects of my personality i often think of myself as selfish , needy , jealous , manipulative , and over bearing . but for some reason unbeknownst to me he stays by my side and i m forever grateful .","310943":"i used to go to the library often when i was in high school and college , but i honestly haven t been to the library since i graduated . it was the prime place for me to do my term papers and study , so i haven t had a reason to go to the library since i stopped going to school .","310944":"of course not . you don t get a pass at being an abvsive person simply because you have a mental illness that predisposes you to certain behavioral trends . a major component of mental health recovery and awareness is becoming mindful of your actions and how they affect others and taking the necessary precautions to ensure that you don t repeat the same mistakes .","310945":"a strong sense of family . i ve never been close to my family for a variety of reasons i d rather not get into , so it s always left me yearning for familial bonding and closeness . i never felt that i was ever able to confide in my family when i was struggling because they were usually the reason why i was having problems , so from a young age , i ve always wished for a family to call my own .","310946":"i m probably going to end up deleting this because i normally hate talking about my family , but my mother is the worst person to talk to when you need advice need to vent about something . she has the terrible tendency to turn every situation against herself , making herself out to be the victim regardless of the circumstance , until you re not talking about your own struggles anymore , you re talking about her problems . i understand that her need to constantly talk about herself is rooted in some psychological fear of failure and lack of self worth , but she won t ever acknowledge that she has a problem and , instead , gaslights everyone around her to make themselves out to seem crazy , meanwhile she s the normal one who has to deal with our problems . it can be incredibly frustrating and self defeating , which is why i ve never talked to her about any of my personal issues over the years besides the fact that , above most other reasons , she was the reason for my problems .","310947":"this depends entirely on the rules of the company you work for some companies prohibit inter office dating , while others are more relaxed with what they think is acceptable . i would consult your company s handbook or talk to your supervisor regarding their policies .","310948":"put in your two weeks notice so that the company has ample time to find your replacement . and even if they cannot or didn t bother to find a replacement for you , you at least gave them the opportunity to do so and can leave with a clear head .","310949":"it depends on our financial circumstances . but you re asking me a question about something that s more than years into the future , so i can t predict how the economy is going to be at that time .","310950":"askfm has introduced me to quite a few lovely people to whom i ve become close over the years . things that remind me of them courrtana overwatch , iced coffee , and anything pixelated and cute . cynixism life is strange , constellations and the cosmos , and bpd tumblr memes . princess tal mental illness memes , cats , and anything having to do with law .","310951":"i m not comfortable answering these sorts of questions . sex isn t something i enjoy talking about .","310952":"no . sex is usually the last thing on my mind because i have an extremely low sex drive as a result of the medication i take .","310953":"i d like to be remembered for my passion for helping others , especially in regards to mental health concerns and erasing stigmas .","310954":"my boyfriend s car accident definitely shocked me , especially after i arrived at the scene of the accident and saw my friend laying on the ground with basically half of her forehead detached from her skull . this is something none of us are going to be able to get over for a long time . i still get emotional just thinking about it .","310955":"i m currently in thousands of dollars of debt . gotta love capitalism .","310956":"sometimes . i miss the aspect of learning new things in class , but i definitely don t miss the stress associated with schoolwork .","310957":"wow , i m surprised people remember that photo considering that was two years ago . i go in phases with shaving sometimes i feel better with them shaved , sometimes without .","310958":"this isn t something i can predict . both my boyfriend and i need to get a lot of things straightened up in our lives such as our living situations , jobs , etc before we can even think about getting engaged and affording a wedding . however , i m definitely in no rush . these things take time and patience .","310959":"i already answered the question which was posed to her , and i said that i wasn t educated on the matter so i couldn t develop an opinion on it . therefore , it s impossible for me to agree or disagree with cadence , since i would have to be educated on the topic first before developing an opinion . cc babycadiex","310960":"yes , they re both catholic .","310961":"i ve already been to college and graduated with a bachelor s degree . however , i think they wanted me to go to college but they probably would have respected my choice if i had decided to take up a trade .","310962":"aw , thank you","310963":"i ve never had that happen to me before . idk if it would bother me or not they say imitation is the highest form of flattery , so i would probably take it as a compliment .","310964":"they re expensive , but their products last a long time and have helped my skin and hair immensely . i only have to wash my hair twice a week because of how cleansing their shampoos conditioners are , and their facial scrubs are luxurious .","310965":"hello my day has been all right , thank you for asking . i found out that my friend involved in the accident is home now and doing well , so that made me quite happy . work went all right as usual , and now i m sitting down and watching the new season of oitnb . thinking about grabbing a beer , tbh .","310966":"bones and parks rec . although i don t think they were cancelled as much as they were just finished . but regardless , i was a puddle of emotion at the conclusion of both shows .","310967":". . . i don t know if you re requesting me to post something useful or making a statement that declares that i don t generally post useful content .","310968":"i don t live in the uk .","310969":"leigh s struggle of the day do i take a nap or begin watching the new season of oitnb ?","310970":"idk anyone who s ever denied that , but then again , i only follow a small number of educated people on askfm . however , that being said , i actually know a lot of people who never graduated college who are earning more money than me . statistically , yes , there s a higher chance of earning more money with a bachelor s degree or higher , but everyone s paths unfold in a different way .","310971":"it is my first harry potter convention , actually ! ! i m really excited to see everyone dressed up in cosplay , drink alcoholic harry potter inspired drinks , and take part in the sorting hat ceremony .","310972":"i do , but it s not something i d ever post on the internet because it s six years old , i looked terrible in it , and i feel dysmorphic every time i look at it .","310973":"why is this so accurate","310974":"i m going to a harry potter convention on sunday . d","310975":"how about a picture of the sunset at the beach instead ?","310976":"aw , thank you . this is very sweet","310977":"i m very open in real life , to the point where i m often afraid that i ll scare people away because i have a tendency to overshare information in an effort to relate to others . i d like to think i m approachable , but the truth is that i m often too caught up in my own thoughts to really notice the outside world around me , which makes me appear quite cold and distant . i also have resting bitch face , which certainly doesn t help . but it s easy for me to get along with others for the most part because i m not high maintenance .","310978":"i enjoy most of the anon questions i receive because they re actually curious about my life or my perspectives on different issues . if there are any anon questions i don t like or don t feel comfortable answering , i usually just delete the question .","310979":"it means nothing to me . as long as i have my small inner circle of friends , it doesn t matter much to me what my social status is like if i even have one to begin with .","310980":"things could be better , but i m not one to actively complain . ps thank you everyone for your well wishes and prayers . my friend involved in the accident is making a full recovery from surgery and she should be going home on friday .","310981":"somewhat , yes . i m taking the steps i need to better myself and that s what s important . i could have been dealt a better hand growing up , but i ve been making due with what was given to me and that s the only thing you can do .","310982":"when you find the right person for you , every day you re with them is another adventure . i ve been with my boyfriend for years and not once has our relationship gotten boring .","310983":"lol i never bullied anyone on askfm , let alone brittany . yes , we re friends and she doesn t live in tx anymore .","310984":"no , bisexuality refers to attraction to two genders the prefix bi means two .","310985":"no , it just means i m attracted to people regardless of their gender whether they re men , women , or trans . the prefix pan means all .","310986":"i have freckles , but i m indifferent to them .","310987":"perhaps this is just me being paranoid , but this sounds like a fake account pretending to be tori . if anyone agrees with me , let me know . i m not getting good vibes from this , especially after all of the hatred she s been receiving lately .","310988":"take things slow , and day by day . these kinds of things tend to have a pretty heavy emotional toll down the road when things slow down enough for everything to really hit you so to speak . i m not sure if there s anything i can do to help , but if you find yourself needing anything , let me know thank you , erin . that means a lot to me . i also have a terrible tendency to neglect myself while caring for other people because i m naturally a healer in theonlyems s words . i think higher of other people than i do of myself and often believe i m not deserving of much care compared to others , so it s easy for me to neglect my own needs . but i ve been trying to take care of myself the best i can . i also have a therapy appointment tomorrow where i ll be talking about the accident , so i m looking forward to that too . i m sure she ll offer me a few different methods of self healing as well . thanks for the kind words , they re very much appreciated .","310989":"thank you so much , doug . it s going to be a long and hefty process , but he s going to pay for what he did , both literally and metaphorically .","310990":"physically and mentally . all of us will be here for you if you need extra support , so if you need to rant , feel free to . the support from everyone has been so unreal and i m grateful for all of the messages i ve been receiving . i can only hope this positive energy channels itself into my friend s spirit so that she can make a full recovery that s the only thing i care about rn , honestly . i just want her to be ok . thank you for this kind message , it s very much appreciated .","310991":"i can relate and this actually makes me feel somewhat better , so thank you .","310992":"sometimes i do believe in purposes like this , and i agree . i can t imagine the horror my boyfriend would have went through had i been injured as well , especially given his mental state after he had fully realized what had happened . things like this always seem to happen to me , though . tragedy happens to everyone around me , but not to me directly and i think it s because in some spiritual sense , i m meant to help others when they re lost or broken . i m meant to be a beacon of support when others are in need and can t be support for themselves . i ve had to stay strong for so many people in my life because they couldn t be strong for themselves in the moment , like i m a life boat for them to cling to in times of need .","310993":"my friend is in surgery right now , and my boyfriend is okay . my boyfriend got away with cuts and bruises , and i m crying because i m so thankful that it wasn t anything worse due to the graphic nature of the accident . as for the guy who did it , nobody knows who he is except for the driver of our vehicle who also walked away unharmed . it s on the police report but my friends are probably going to sue because of how horrible the accident was , the medical expenses of my friend s surgeries , and the cost of the car .","310994":"no , this is a old coworker of my boyfriend s . i ve hung out with her dozens of times in the past and she s such a sweet girl . i can t believe this happened to her . i just woke up first time i ve slept in two days so i haven t heard any news yet . the last i heard , she was being prepped for surgery .","310995":"they got into a really bad car accident last night . someone blew through a red light and t boned them in the middle of an intersection . the car spun out and flipped twice into the middle of the road . they re all so lucky to be alive .","310996":"thank you so much haydn .","310997":"thank you . i just feel so guilty like i should have been there . there literally just dropped me off and got into the accident in the next intersection . i feel so helpless and i hate it .","310998":"thank you so much .","310999":"thank you , that means a lot to me .","311000":"they were both in the same car . they got t boned by a car that blew through a red light and their car ended up flipping in the middle of the street . my boyfriend walked away with bruises but my friend got much worse . i m so worried about her .","311001":"thank you .","311002":"i don t normally do this , but can people please send prayers to my friend and my boyfriend ? they got into a devastating car accident last night , and my friend is going to need reconstructive surgery to fix what happened to her during the accident . it was absolutely terrifying and they both deserve all of the love and prayers right now . thank you .","311003":"i got so bored after my shower that i did an entire makeup tutorial via snapchat . smh","311004":"somewhat , but not necessarily more . you do gain insight into what s on someone s mind with the questions they ask , but the way people answer questions is far more significant in terms of discovering who someone is . not to mention the fact that answers allow for a more in depth response than questions do . you only have a certain number of characters with questions .","311005":"sometimes i get questions that are too invasive , so i can t tell the whole truth or else it would be an invasion of my personal privacy . in those instances , i ll either skirt around the issue or i ll delete the question entirely . however , i m open and honest for the most part . askfm is a place for me to vent so there would be no purpose in me lying about my life .","311006":"i m really sorry that you feel that way . there was a time in my life where i had none of these things either , and it took a lot of time and struggle for me to be able to find these things in my life as well . i m nearly years old , and the concept of having a good life is relatively strange to me , because for the past years , every day was a downward struggle . i sincerely hope that you re able to find the help you deserve i really do . i was in your position once , and what i can tell you is to never give up hope . it may be incredibly difficult given your position , but i know you re stronger than that , and one day , you ll be in a position where you can say that things are looking up for the better .","311007":"dear ex boyfriend , thank you for teaching me that i deserve better in my life than what you were offering me . you took advantage of my innocence , and for that , i ll never be able to forgive you . however , my experiences with you taught me that i deserved someone in my life who cared about my feelings and wouldn t take advantage of me something you were unable to do . thank you for opening my mind to greater possibilities and for teaching me that i shouldn t settle for just anyone who gave me the attention i sought .","311008":"my life is looking up , thank you for asking my relationship with my therapist has gotten a lot stronger , and i feel like i can confide in her a lot more than previously . she s been helping me a lot in coming to terms with my trauma and validating my experiences , which is uber important to me . at the same time , my best friend hired a realtor who s going to help them find a house to rent , so i may be moving out of my parents house a lot sooner than anticipated hopefully before august . my relationship with my boyfriend is more rewarding than ever and i ve been a lot more open with him regarding my feelings , which has been for the better lately . and while my current job has its certain pitfalls , i realize that they ve very accommodating to my mental illnesses , and i don t think i ll be able to find that elsewhere . as such , i want to make the effort to develop healthier coping mechanisms , healthier eating habits , and perhaps get back into running so that i can lose weight . i fell off the wagon recently in terms of my mental health , but i think i m finally getting a grasp onto something tangible in helping me lead a healthier lifestyle .","311009":"i don t go shopping for myself very often , and when i do , it s usually something small like a book or a bottle of alcohol . otherwise , most of my money is spent on paying off my bills , gas for my car , cigarettes , coffee , and food for the household .","311010":"does my medication count ? i accidentally went without my medication for two days last week , and i turned into such a depressed , vile , suicidal human being . it made me realize how dependent i am on my medication , which is a scary thought , but also how much my medication has helped me over the past year or so .","311011":"tbh i really want a large iced coffee from starbucks with a toasted bagel . i ve been terribly obsessed with their caramel iced espresso drinks lately , but i m far too lazy rn to drive all the way to starbucks in order to get one .","311012":"the worst relationship i ve ever been in was when i was . i stupidly dated an year old because i was young , dumb , and rebellious . i should have seen the warning signs before it happened , but i was naive and convinced that he loved me .","311013":"i don t see how this is anyone s business .","311014":"a house for myself and my boyfriend , a house for my best friend and her husband , a new car for my boyfriend , and a couple of vacations . i d also pay off the rest of my debt .","311015":"i don t resemble her physically , but my personality is very similar to the personality of chloe price from the video game life is strange . chloe s personality has been altered significantly by the losses she sustained in her life , and as a result of those losses , she experiences a fear of abandonment . at the same time , chloe is very mischievous , rebellious , snarky , pessimistic , and resentful she smokes weed , drinks , and leads a very reckless lifestyle . she has the tendency to be stubborn , possessive , and selfish , but she s also very loyal and faithful to her close friends .","311016":"i do i ve been reading books ever since i was a child . there were a few years where i fell off the wagon and neglected my reading duties , but i ve been slowly getting back into the habit of reading books on a regular basis . i missed it .","311017":"this is also a very insensitive question to ask someone as it , too , can be quite triggering and upsetting to those who have suffered from forms of trauma and are recovering from self harm . i highly suggest you do not ask these questions to anyone else in the future .","311018":"i think marijuana should be legalized and taxed just like cigarettes and alcohol are . i see no reason for it not to be marijuana actually has a lot of medical benefits from a psychiatric and physical standpoint .","311019":"no . i can barely find purpose in my life as it is , let alone find a purpose in a life which doesn t end . i feel as if living an immortal life would be very bleak and monotonous for me .","311020":"tonight was pretty fantastic alcoholic drinks on the beach and live music preceded by gyros at the greek festival .","311021":"i m doing well ! ! i just got home i went to the greek festival and ate gyros and drank a frappe , and then afterwards i went to the beach for live music and a margarita . i m really happy rn","311022":"thank you , that was actually information i did not know ! ! not only that , but he was also a very talented painter . that obviously doesn t mean that all talented painters are going to be genocide committing dictators . ?","311023":"somewhat , yes . a big part of mental health recovery is taking care of your body , which means eating healthy , drinking plenty of water , and exercising within moderation . while it may not contribute directly to reducing stress , it certainly helps it putting people in a healthier state of mind which makes them more capable of handling stress .","311024":"i don t align myself with the feminist community because the community itself , especially on online platforms , is mostly toxic , accusatory , and closeminded . while i still stand firm to my social beliefs and still try to remain active and vigilant , i do so without being under the guise of feminism .","311025":"i normally like musky , deep scents polo black , for example . i ve never been a fan of fruity or floral scents because it aggravates my sinuses .","311026":"i used to be able to read and compose music when i was a teenager , but i ve forgotten most of that knowledge over time .","311027":"for the most part , yes . i respect their commitment to that lifestyle because society certainly doesn t make it easy to remain vegetarian or vegan these days , and its something i wish i could easily do . the only time i d lose respect for vegetarians and vegans is if they shove their beliefs down my throat . i don t have respect for people who aren t understanding that not everyone has the capability of leading the same lifestyle .","311028":"sometimes it s rooted in truth , but i don t agree with parents minimalizing their children s feelings just because they may have a hormonal imbalance . regardless of whether or not their unstable moods are due to hormones or mental illness , they should still take the symptoms seriously and hear their children out .","311029":"that was a cute message , thank you","311030":"pants . london . makeup although it depends on my mood . no shave . television . necklace . short hair on myself . halloween .

.","311040":"omg , yes i have seen it . that whole situation is so ridiculous and i m really glad people are calling that person out on what they re attempting to do . you can t replace therapy with talking with a random ass person online for something that s just as expensive as my freaking copays , lmao .","311041":"no , social workers don t have the proper training to dispense medication . my psychiatrist well , ex psychiatrist prescribed my medication .","311042":"unless that friend has been specifically trained in social work for many years , then it isn t necessarily going to achieve the same thing . certain mental disorders require specific therapeutic techniques , and that s only something that can be taught in school .","311043":"that s fine . therapy isn t for everyone and not everyone can be expected to benefit from therapy either . what matters is that it helps those who seek out its services .","311044":"i ll probably use twitter and tumblr more often , if anything . i don t have any plans of migrating to any new sites , though .","311045":"it took me a long time to find a therapist i felt i could connect with , but i m really happy that she s in my life . part of

know is wrong and i m trying to work on it on a daily basis .","311048":"this is a really common feeling to have , especially when people may not necessarily be as understanding of mental illness as they should be . i often feel this way towards my partner and best friend i feel as if i burden them with my mental illnesses or as if i m holding them back due to my own insecurities . and when that happens , it s incredibly common to feel as if you should take back what s been said or done . i hope you find the help that you deserve . don t leave yourself out of this , because your happiness is just as important and as valid as everyone else s .","311049":"i m sorry that you re going through all of this , friend . i understand your feelings , though and its tough when you feel like you have nobody to talk to . you may not want to go to school , but it might be the only way you ll be able to receive the mental help you need and its completely confidential so nobody will know that you re going there . regardless of what you choose to do , i wish you luck .","311050":"is there a school counselor you can talk to regarding your feelings ? they may be able to help you with respect to your mental health or help you make a plan in having your mother understand that your issue isn t laziness , it s your mental health . if that doesn t work , perhaps you can talk to your mother about seeing a therapist . plenty of people use therapy for more than just mental health reasons , so the idea might resonate with her if you inform her that you feel like it would be good to talk to someone about your feelings .","311051":"the simple things in life make me happy drinking the first cup of coffee in the morning , spending lazy sundays with my love , getting achievements on xbox ,

the person in question is , what the first chance was , and what they did to ruin that first chance . i have a general tendency to hold somewhat of a grudge , but i also have been known to forgive and forget . it depends on how a person has wronged me and what attempts they ve made to amend their mistake .","311053":"not at all . we have a very open and honest relationship , so if one person is

because it s tackling problems and stigmas that s talked about even less in the mental health community .","311057":"i generally have the most sympathy for trauma survivors because i can relate to

.","311058":"i know ! ! it s wild tbh . and it makes for such unsafe internet environments , there s no escaping it . having a smartphone makes it so easy to browse the internet unfiltered , and it frightens me for young minors in today s age because i feel like it s become so much easier over the years for children to fall into traps . and not only that , but perpetrators of crimes have found their ways around filters and have infiltrated online communities . i would honestly hate to have a young child because of how paranoid i would be .","311059":"a you don t know me b you cannot love

behavior as a result of their genes , and that could be further exacerbated through a poor upbringing or exposure to multiple traumas . on the contrary , there are some children who have had a relatively normal upbringing , but they still may be prone to violent behavior as a result of neurological or psychological deficits that have altered their personalities . i ve always found this topic to be extremely interesting because it delves down into the root of aggressive behavior . i m currently watching a show called killer kids that s all about children who have committed heinous

unfortunately , i m not a good basis to determine whether something is normal or not . if this continues and your depression comes back , i urge you to speak to your doctor about your feelings . they can either refer you to a therapist where you ll learn healthy coping techniques or they can alternatively prescribe you medication to help with your depressed mood .","311073":"i took a year of tae

urges while simultaneously trying to save his small town from the grips of a serial killing monster . his character is really intriguing because he has low empathy , so he has internal monologues regarding wanting to feel empathy for other people but ultimately viewing people as objects . he wants to study human bodies and he s fixated by how the human body works . he s the textbook definition of a young person who will grow into antisocial personality disorder , and i find his thoughts regarding death and murder to be intriguing .","311085":"aw , welcome back ! ! not too much has been

the movie frozen . i never understood the appeal of her character because she was so unlikeable in my opinion . however , i loved merida from brave and i don t think her character is discussed often enough . she was such a strong female lead , and the movie itself was fantastic .","311106":"when the topic of feminism first began catching wind on social media , i was quick to align myself with intersectional feminism because it already resonated strongly with the beliefs i currently hold . however , as time progressed , i feel as if feminism itself took its own course and delved into often restrictive and hypocritical forms of thought , especially on social media sites such as twitter and tumblr . what used to be a respectable mode of thinking turned into something laughable because of the great masses of neo feminists who spoke on topics they obviously had no idea about and used feminism as a means of advancing their own popularity . i still believe in many typical feminist beliefs and ways of thinking , and if you had to consider me under any label it would probably be some sort of mixture between intersectional and radical feminism , but i ve since distanced myself from the feminist movement because of what it s turned into and how toxic the community has become .","311107":"i m not proud of much , but i am proud of the fact that i graduated at the top of my class when i

periods of high moods and low moods , called manic and depressive episodes , respectively . manic episodes are defined by periods of great euphoria , impulsivity , racing thoughts , reckless behavior , needing little to no sleep , etc etc . depressive episodes are defined by periods of hopeless moods , requiring a lot of sleep , anhedonia , little energy , fatigue , etc etc . there are typically subtypes of bipolar disorder , but most people classify as bipolar or bipolar . bipolar disorder had what s called hypomanic episodes where the individual still experienced mania but to a lesser degree . however , in order to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder , i believe you need to experience at least one week of manic symptoms followed by two weeks of depressive symptoms , and sometimes symptoms are severe enough to require immediate hospitalization .","311136":"it s entirely possible . depending on the individual , they could either remember the traumatic experience or they could repress the memory completely . either way , it would have a profound impact on the way the individual grows up and behaves .","311137":"i m sorry that you have to go through that that must be hard to

prefer to remain the only person in white if they choose a white wedding gown , others simply don t care .","311149":"i think most compliments are based on appearances because it s the easiest thing to compliment a person on without putting in too much critical thought behind the compliment . it s simple enough to compliment a person s hairstyle , but you really have to sit there and think about how a person genuinely is in order to compliment something about their personality or their achievements .","311150":"i will always recommend therapy there s no such thing as not depressed enough for any kind of mental health treatment , because the fact that you still had bad days is enough to warrant treatment of some kind , whether it s through therapy or medication or a combination of the two . your therapist isn t going to invalidate your experiences , and if anything , they re going to say the same things i m telling you with respect to your depression depression comes and goes in waves , you ll have good days and bad days , and what s important is the progress you will make . therapy is honestly a wonderful thing , it s healthy to gain an outside perspective on your problems and be taught productive means of coping with your feelings , regardless of what those feelings are .","311151":"the whole hi how are you isn t creepy imo , but the whole where are you from is teetering on

enforcing that addiction , but you re also putting your friends and family at risk because of your actions . i ve known too many people lose their friends , lose their family , and lose their own lives due to their addictions , and it affects nearly every aspect of someone s life . drug use is not a victim less crime , not unless that person is somehow a hermit with no friends or family

trust your boyfriend . by indicating to him that you don t want him speaking to one of his exes , you re actually indicating that you don t trust the things he could potentially say to her or stand up for his current relationship . however , he did betray your trust either way by promising not to talk to her and then going behind your back to enter a group chat with her . this is something you need to discuss with him on a mature level .","311195":"thank you that s fine with me , i like talking about my relationship tbh . i know that what my boyfriend and i have is special because we ve been

say we see each other times per week . however , we talk on the phone at least twice per day , send each other snapchats , and text each other occasionally . it actually works out in our favor at times because we re given the space that we need on the days we can t see one another , so that on the days we can see each other , we take full advantage of the time given to us . we re hoping to move into a house together sometime within the next year , so hopefully we ll be able to see each other more often on a regular basis .","311197":"everybody is different , so there s really no

and thankfully he is understanding of when i need space versus when i just need his comfort . but the reason why we work so well together is because we re open and honest about our needs to one

as for your second question , i think it is possible to unconsciously feign symptoms of mental illness without actually having the illness itself . it s like a placebo effect . if you read enough about a disorder , you could unintentionally display symptoms of that disorder like a self fulfilling prophecy . look up medical student syndrome and you ll see that it happens often in medical

person is still engaging in it is bad enough to where they require psychological attention . i can hurt myself and the wound will disappear the next day . that doesn t leave any lasting physical

becomes a problem .","311218":"oh hahah . well if that was the case , i would wait for them to come to me if they needed help with something such as dealing with depression . if i knew them well

person .","311317":"i m incredibly annoyed by them because they take up half of my feed , to the point where i can rarely read people s answers anymore because my feed only shows maybe recent answers

strong work ethic , and he s very good with children and animals . he s a good person by heart , but his life has led him astray in a variety of ways , and now he s in the process of turning things

be unrealistic , especially with the influx of work we ve been receiving , it s still a source of stress for me . i m a perfectionist by nature , and it gets under my skin when i see assignments become overdue or in the negative , so whenever i have a group of assignments become overdue , it puts me into maximum overdrive and i feel the need to rush to finish everything on time .","311357":"i ve always been my own worst enemy and my biggest critic nobody is harder on me than i am on myself , and i always hold myself to the highest standards .","311358":"i haven t watched netflix in a while

an extremely intriguing sci fi show ! ! i recommend it if you re looking for something compelling and bizarre .","311359":"it s literally a fact that some psych meds will lower people s sex drives . sometimes it s the sacrifice you have to make for better mental health .","311360":"hopefully . i m in no rush , though . i m already in a relationship with someone i can envision marrying , we just

to me , i m bored as fuck .","311364":"i think it did a shit job of raising awareness for svicide and mental health filming graphic scenes glamorizes and makes a spectacle out of trauma , it doesn t actually inform the audience of the implications of being mentally ill and how trauma can affect someone . i also really dislike how everyone on social media is suddenly woke and spreading awareness for svicide prevention and trauma because of a tv show that romanticizes mental illness . neurotypical people are trying to speak up over trauma survivors over what s acceptable and unacceptable , and it s only silencing survivors , not giving them a voice .","311365":"i make a lot of random sound effects in my speech my boyfriend likes to compare me to a bunny or a chinchilla . if i m feeling awkward , i squeak or meep . i also talk with my hands a lot , regardless of what i m actually holding in my hands . i fidget a lot and i m always playing with something in my hands or fingers .","311366":"it depends upon the severity of the mistake if you make a mistake and it seriously harms someone , then i don t believe you should be given a second chance . there s a big difference between making a harmless mistake which we all make and doing something intentionally or unintentionally and causing a person serious harm . those don t deserve second chances , in my opinion .","311367":"it s certainly an interesting idea , but i feel as if it would be hard to implement because a lot of cyber bullying is based on anonymity . while there are ways to find out someone s ip address , it isn t always guaranteed because you don t know if someone is using a public server like at a library . however , i do agree that cyber bullying should be considered a criminal offense . it s led to too many victims falling through the cracks and getting seriously hurt as a result .","311368":"i ve already written letters in the . hours i ve been here , and i only check my askfm after i m done with an assignment and need a break to breathe . whether i m on askfm or doing something else , it doesn t particularly matter . if i continuously work nonstop , it s only going to burn me out .","311369":"idk , i have to think about it some more and ask the supervising attorney if i would be allowed to do so , i don t have the strength to ask him just yet because that would require talking about my mental health issues and idk if i m ready to do that just yet . they don t see it for as bad as it actually is because often i ll lie and say i m out sick with a stomach flu or something . like , they know i have issues with my anxiety and they ve been accommodating with that , but i don t tell them the extent of my symptoms because i don t want to be seen as a burden on the company . if that makes sense .","311370":"thank you , you re too sweet . ? i m trying to take it one step at a time but it s just overwhelming to see everything laid out in front of me at once , all due today or monday . i just have to keep telling myself that i ll get to what i can get to and they ll just have to wait because i can t do it all . i put so much pressure on myself at work to finish everything , even if the deadlines are unrealistic . i ve been thinking about requesting to work from home because work has been so bad for my mental health lately , i ve been missing days per month .","311371":"i haven t been at work in two days , and i just came back today and my deadline report is filled to the brim with assignments because they kept assigning me work to do even though i wasn

i met when we were years old through a mutual friend who ended up changing schools from my public school to his private school , thus becoming friends with both of us . i always had a shy interest in him because he was extremely outgoing , charismatic , and funny . eventually , we exchanged phone numbers when i was years old and began talking through text , and he asked me out on a date . our first date was actually dinner and a movie we ate at johnny rockets , which is a s styled diner , and we saw one of the wolverine movies afterwards lol . after that , things just eventually fell into place and we started dating regularly , even when i later traveled miles away to college . our relationship has been tumultuous since then , but it s calmed down a lot over the past few years and i can t imagine being with anyone else .","311374":"me , sitting at my desk in a swivel chair , screaming internally as papers cascade down from the ceiling and my fingers are slamming violently into my keyboard as i try to meet my deadlines .","311375":"that just means you haven t met the right person yet . when you re dating the right person for you , every day is an adventure with them and you

for it , at least make it more accessible for students to obtain methods of birth control without shame or embarrassment . abstinence training has proven to be meaningless in terms of sex education , and i think schools need to be more open with their students regarding safe sex , methods of birth control , and consent . the only way to truly prevent things such as unwanted teen pregnancy is education , so the more resources , the better .","311390":"self diagnosis undermines those who have had to go through extensive means to obtain a formal diagnosis so that they can go through the proper medical treatment to maintain their disorders . i don t believe people should seek to self diagnosis unless they intend on seeking professional help and using their research to help aid their doctors in coming to a diagnosis . otherwise it s infringing upon communities of people who are legitimately diagnosed with serious disorders and minimalizing their symptoms .","311391":"there has not been a single terrorist act committed in the us that was from a refugee , let alone a syrian refugee . the vetting process that refugees undergo basically eliminates any threat of terrorism , so there has been no risk to our country . turning away refugees only leads them to return back to the country they re trying to escape from , which in turn diminishes our reputation as an ally to war torn countries .","311392":"yes . addiction is a disease and the gene for addiction can be passed down genetically through family members my father was an alcoholic , which increases my odds of being an alcoholic later in life . although it ultimately comes down to choice , that doesn t refute the fact that addiction can be genetically ingrained in you , making you more likely to become addicted to a substance later in life . as an additional matter , addiction is considered a mental health issue . treatment for addiction is similar to treatment for other mental illnesses , which includes rehabilitation and outpatient or sometimes inpatient therapy and medication management . it s a diagnosed mental health condition listed in the dsm and icd , so for all intents and purposes , it s a medical disease .","311393":"yes and no . in an ideal world , askfm users would be able to have a blacklist of specific words or phrases they don t want asked to them . then in its filtering system , askfm would automatically delete those questions with those words in them so that the specific user doesn t see the question . i don t see askfm having that technology soon , though .","311394":"let s drop bombs on syria to show syria that dropping bombs on syria is bad . sure , because that logically makes sense . smh . it also irritates me how the us has denied refugees from syria at our

finished with it yet , but i have a strong feeling that it s using hannah s svicide as a plot device to further the character development of everyone else which only further stigmatizes mental illness , it doesn t spread awareness of teen svicide or depression . it doesn t focus on hannah s feeling as much as it does on the feelings of everyone else around her and the drama that ensues as a result of that . with a topic as heavy as svicide , i would have wanted them to be more sensitive towards the subject matter and allegedly the producers went against a lot of what psychologists advised for them to do to make it a safer series . i simply don t think people should ultimately profit off of the subject matter if you re going to make a drama off of svicide , then be mature and informative about it . i feel like they ultimately skirted the issue , not to mention the graphic scenes which were totally unnecessary . idk i m very conflicted about the entire project .","311414":"female woman

self inflicted . i have them all over my arms and my legs , and it makes navigating my daily life a living hell every day because it makes it difficult to wear short sleeves without receiving comments from strangers . in the same vein , it pisses me off how internet culture has somehow romanticized scarring into some tragic , fragile metaphor . scarring depletes nerve tissue and causes a host of medical problems , not to mention the emotional implications of living day to day with horrific scarring all over your body . it isn t romantic and it isn t something people should be craving to have . i detest all of my scars and i beat myself up everyday for doing this to myself .","311420":"i made this aesthetic collage for myself a while ago","311421":"no , i m in a monogamous relationship

about it . part of me is happy that svicide and its implications is being talked about more openly , but i m also afraid that the show is glamorizing it somewhat and is failing to show the reasons why someone should seek help if they re feeling svicidal . at the same time , i haven t finished the show yet so i may be speaking prematurely .","311427":"watching reasons why and drinking alcohol was a baaaaaad idea , fml .","311428":"it depends on the intention behind the flirting some people are just naturally flirtacious and don t mean anything by their flirting , regardless of how it may seem from the outside perspective . if you re flirting with the intention of deceiving your partner , then obviously that s bad and may inevitably lead to cheating . however , i do believe harmless flirting exists and it s important for people in relationships to settle on boundaries regarding what is acceptable and what is unacceptable .","311429":"i m exhausted and don t want to focus on working rn .","311430":"i don t necessarily need to relate to a character in order to enjoy a book , but it does enhance the reading experience and makes me more emotionally invested in the story . i m not picky when it comes to books and i love anything that has a good story , but it does help when i can relate to the characters on a certain level because it shows that the author has made them real .","311431":"yes . there have been plenty of times i ve been discriminated against or looked down upon solely due to my sex as a female , and i ve encountered workplace discrimination for the

performing the same tasks .","311432":"i tried a vegetarian lifestyle on one occasion , and unfortunately it made my body extremely weak and frail because i wasn t providing myself the proper

i believe the moon landing was real , and i believe that nasa is telling the truth . nasa is a scientific institute with intentions on spreading information and awareness about science related

beach , but i feel like that would be such a relaxing experience the feeling of swaying back and forth in the wind combined with the crashing of the waves on the shore and seasalt in your hair and on your skin . as for the other questions , i prefer winter over the summer , but while the snow is beautiful , i m also more anxious during the winter because i hate having to drive in the snow .

walking around my backyard most days ! !","311445":"i absolutely love the feeling of sliding into bed after a hot , relaxing shower . your muscles loosen up and you feel completely at ease during this

body washes ! ! so it s like aromatherapy .","311446":"i m not comfortable with the way i look often , i look in the mirror and am confused at what i see , because what i see in the mirror isn t an

health issues and disabilities . i m constantly learning and teaching myself about mental health , therapeutic interventions , and other ways to advocate for disabilities , because i believe that there is still such a big stigma attached to mental illness and it needs to be eradicated so that people can obtain the help they deserve .","311448":"why is sparkling water bad for your health ? ! o i never knew that , for a while it was the only water i drank . i don t drink much water per day , though perhaps ml per day , if even that much . most of what i drink throughout the day is either coffee or tea my job can be very monotonous and boring at times , so i need the caffeine to keep myself focused throughout the day .","311449":"i don t feel comfortable answering specific sex questions on my profile .","311450":"sex doesn t matter much to me . if my partner and i had a solid relationship but we didn t have sex at all , then i would still be completely happy with the arrangement . sex is an added bonus , not necessarily a necessity for me .","311451":"thank you ! ! we don t have any set plans right now , it s just an idea at the moment until everyone gets on the same page and gathers enough money for a deposit . we re looking at june , though that ll be when my best friend is promoted into her own store , it gives everyone more time to collect money , and opportunities for us to talk about what we re expecting and how to coordinate household chores . even if my boyfriend can t move in right away , i m definitely looking to move out of my house either way . staying here has become a chore in itself , especially because these days i ve become somewhat of a caretaker to my mother in addition to all of the other roles i play in my life , and it s been preventing me from being my complete self .","311452":"i brush my teeth once per day , wash my hair times per week , and go outside multiple times per day . ever since i started using vegan hair products , my hair has been consistent and hasn t needed to be washed more than times per week , which saves me a lot of time and money in the long run . my hair also feels a hundred times healthier now than it did when i was using regular drug store products , and it s going to feel even better once i chop it all off again .","311453":"lately i ve been eating all light meals i ll normally have a slice of pound cake or a banana for breakfast with a big cup of coffee , a small sandwich for lunch , and dinner varies depending on the day . lately i haven t been having the best relationship with food , so it doesn t matter to me whether a meal is hot or cold . as long as it works in giving me the proper nutrients , the temperature doesn t much matter . lately i ve been eating as a necessity rather than a desire , i don t derive pleasure from eating like i used to .","311454":"i love relaxing , weekend breakfasts with my partner where we sleep in late , get up lazily , make a fresh pot of coffee , drink our coffee outside where the weather is nice and sunny , etc . it s been a while since we ve had a breakfast like that , unfortunately . but i always look forward to spending lazy mornings with my love , it s like a breath of fresh air .","311455":"aw , good luck on your move ! ! i m not happy with my living situation at all i still live with my parents and i desperately need to move out and find my own place . i m currently looking into renting a house with my best friend and her husband and a few other people , so i m crossing my fingers and hoping it works out for the best because staying at home with my parents has been a deterrent to my mental health .","311456":"to me , old fashioned means to be antiquated in thought processes , following a set of moral codes that aren t necessarily relevant to today s modern age . for example , having an old fashioned mindset would include the conglomeration of church and state , reinforcement of gender stereotypes , etc . i m definitely not old fashioned in the way i think and behave , especially because i m considered to be a millennial and constantly at the forefront of new technology and patterns of thinking . i can see social trends and behaviors and adjust myself accordingly .","311457":"pets ! ! i can t imagine owning my own house , with either my best friend or my significant other , without pets being involved in some form or another . having animals in the house makes it feel more like a home .","311458":"it depends entirely upon what you re using that intelligence for , in my opinion . it can be a leader like trait if you have a natural disposition for being a leader , in that you can use your intelligence to group together masses of people and guide them towards a common goal . however , you can also use intelligence behind the scenes , so to speak . many people with higher iqs are more prone to being socially isolative as they would rather be with themselves inside their own head as opposed to being around people .","311459":"i m pretty wary of my body s needs i ve has this body for years now , so i ve become accustomed to its desires and how to give it what it wants , even if the requests are a bit bizarre . sometimes i m not so great at giving it what it wants on a conscious level i . e . , i ll refuse myself things as punishment , but i ve been getting better at that over time .","311460":"yes who honestly wouldn t get annoyed at that behavior ? ? if there s one pet peeve of mine , it would actually be this sort of behavior . it gets under my skin when people don t show their gratitude for other people s actions if it aids them in some respect . you have to be fairly self centered in order to not say thank you when someone helps you or is nice to you .","311461":"lol what kind of question is this .","311462":"you need to have open communication with your girlfriend and inform her of how you feel . you re obviously uncomfortable with the

nothing inherently wrong with being trans , but it can be frustrating when people are purposely misunderstanding gender identity and sex in an attempt to ridicule us . i m aware that they re only trolling , but it s still immature and counterproductive .","311466":"we co exist , but that s the extent of our relationship .","311467":"wake up , get coffee , go to work , stress myself out for

.","311471":"sex and gender are two different things your sex is your biological assignment at birth , which is made evident by your chromosomes . your gender is something of a personality profile , a self identified marker that does not necessarily have to have a correlation with your sex . if your sex is aligned with your gender identity , then you re cisgender . if not , then you re transgender . therefore , while i m biologically female , i m also transgender because my gender doesn t align with my biological sex .","311472":"female is a sex , not a gender . i m not wasting my time with this condescending tone .","311473":"i don t understand the purpose of people sending messages like these out to those who make it evident that they feel the opposite . it s honestly such a waste of time and energy .","311474":"i love to travel , even though i m seldom given the opportunity to travel . the furthest i ve ever traveled was from new york where i live to austin , texas for a gaming convention . it was the first time i ever truly planned a vacation on my own , the first time i ever rented hotel rooms , and the first time i ve ever been on a plane . the entire ordeal was extremely

did not die the way we ve been told they died and that an inner conspiracy assassin group took them out to further their own political gain . some prime examples are the assassination of jfk , the death of marilyn monroe , and even kurt cobain s death has led to conspiracy theories about whether or not it was self inflicted . i think the most ridiculous conspiracy theory is the reptilian elite aka , a group of prominent people who are actually lizard people and bent on world domination . the entire idea is laughable .","311479":"i suggest paying your ob gyn a visit then . explain your irregular periods to them and they ll have you take a more accurate pregnancy test . if you can t do that , then i would suggest waiting three weeks and taking it again in three weeks .","311480":"yes

honesty , obtain just for fun . i m interested in so many things that i wouldn t be able to narrow it down . psychology has always been a big interest of mine , but mainly in theory while i do love

i wouldn t be able to be with a person who wasn t supportive or understanding of my mental health conditions . part of the reason why i adore my boyfriend so much is because of how supportive he s been throughout our entire relationship . he s never backed down or shied away from me when i ve acted out . he s always approached me with understanding and a desire to make me comfortable . sense of

problems is just part of being human . my therapist and i have talked about her own bouts of anxiety together , and it actually has made me more comfortable talking to her because i know she

, and i m so fucking sick of not feeling as if anything about me is real . i m really rambling and i don t expect anyone to really get this except maybe two people who probably won t read this anyway

itself as a religion is not inherently destructive or dangerous . the only reason why i consider it my most controversial opinion is because it s the one topic people continuously argue with me about over the course of the many years i ve been on askfm . i think people don t agree with my perspective because islam is predominant in areas of the middle east where terrorism is prevalent it s more of a geographic phenomenon than a religious one . however , ever since the attacks on , fear towards muslims as a whole has been multiplied and it doesn t help that the media plays upon people s fears and has turned islam as a whole into a stigma , especially against the majority of people who are muslim and peaceful .","311515":"i haven t discovered any new music lately however , i ve been

going to prevent your child from seeing a movie just because one of the side characters is rumored to be gay , then you re in for a rude awakening when your child gets older and starts experiencing the world for how it truly is . you cannot shelter your children forever , and you cannot enforce your own beliefs down their throats and expect them to adopt the same views as you especially in today s age where being lgbt has more inclusivity than ever before . it says more about who you are as a parent than what that movie represents .","311517":"the games that originally got me into gaming were old games like tony hawk s pro skater , crash bandicoot , pokemon , the legend of zelda , mario party , super smash bros , etc ! ! i ve been interested in gaming since i was a small child , and its

questions","311526":"yes , i ve intentionally manipulated people for my own personal gain . and i ve also been terribly manipulated by others for their own personal gains too . i ve been emotionally abvsed my entire life , so it s difficult to come from a healthy perspective in terms of how i treat others when i came from a position of not knowing what being treated fairly was like . eventually as i got older , i developed a weak sense of morality , enough to know right versus wrong and to know what was being done to me was wrong , but that doesn t erase the manipulation i ve committed in the past .","311527":"yes there have been times i ve held myself back because i was afraid of what would come as a consequence of my opinions . it s mostly happened in a family or professional setting , i simply didn t want to offend a family member or coworker with my opinions so i chose to stay silent instead . sometimes you have to pick your battles wisely i wouldn t necessarily call it censorship towards myself because i was deliberately choosing not to say something that i felt because i knew there would be adverse reactions to it . i m fairly open about my opinions on askfm , but that s an entirely different environment .","311528":"open communication and compromises are what make relationships work . you have to be willing to talk about things that make you uncomfortable , regardless of how hard they are , so that you and your partner are always on the same page . you have to learn how to take each other s feelings into consideration so that you can make decisions that will act on behalf of both of your interests . you have to be selfless . my relationship works so well because we ve been through hell and back together . we ve been through situations that have made regular arguments seem petty and meaningless , we ve been through crises that have forced us to question our own mortality , we ve endured death and addiction and heartache and survival . we ve lasted for as long as we have because we ve put our faith in one another during dark struggles and have re surfaced stronger than ever before .","311529":"love can be considered an act of defiance if it s against a cultural or familial norm for example , couples with religious differences , lgbt couples , interracial couples , etc . some people are raised in families where they re told it s wrong to be romantic with certain groups of people , and if one happens to fall in love with someone from one of those groups , their very love itself can be misconstrued as an act of defiance against their family or their cultural norms .","311530":"so today , i went dress shopping and picked out a maid of honor dress , i bought new makeup , and i got to play with puppies . i m so happy and chilled

require steadfast alert and control over every aspect of my life , otherwise i ll feel as if my life is a whirlwind of chaos . lately , however , i ve been leaning towards loosening up my inhibitions . i ve been wanting to be out of character , out of mind , for quite a few weeks now , and i can t really place my finger on why . it s suddenly okay for me to let loose and let myself go and fly in the wind and see wherever it takes me , while in the past , i used to be incredibly rigid .","311533":"i think it s moreso travelers from other countries who believe that america is a land of opportunity most americans i know are actually very unpatriotic and believe it s difficult to really be offered opportunities here , which i partially agree with . it can be difficult at times to climb the economic ladder if you don t have personal connections or a financial safety net . that being said , i m also aware that there are a whole handful of countries who offer even less opportunities than america , so by comparison , america is the golden land for opportunities .","311534":"yes , you should break up with her . she clearly deserves to be with a person who loves her and supports her endeavors , regardless of the monetary outcome of those endeavors . she s working towards a master s degree obviously she isn t going to be finished with college for a while , and if you can t support her education , then she deserves someone who will . as an additional matter it s meaningless to compare your own personal milestones with the milestones of others . your friends who are buying homes and having children shouldn t be a basis for comparison with your own life , because everyone s lives are on their own separate timeline . these things will come to you when you re ready .","311535":"this afternoon i told my parents i had eaten , when i really had not . i simply didn t want them to question me as to why i haven t eaten , because i honestly don t know myself . i

them ! ! candy corn , on the other hand , are small candies that are triangular shaped and are split into three colors . they re mostly sold around halloween , although they do have other varieties

controversial , but that doesn t mean it shouldn t be discussed or embraced the more we talk about sexuality , the more education will be spread regarding it and it ll lessen stigmas associated with

they considered somewhat of a villian in that aspect ? i think there s a universal agreement that heroes can only be stereotypically good people , but someone who does bad things could also be seen as a hero to someone , depending on the perspective of the audience . it really starts to twist your concept on morality the more that you think about it .","311591":"the computers were down at work the

intersectional feminist anymore because of the bad associations . i m honestly tired of telling people i m a feminist and being laughed at because i m judged based on the immaturity of the majority

people want to acknowledge it or not . there s a lot more black on black crime that a lot of people don t take into consideration , and there s also plenty of interracial violence too . a lot of

medication for the rest of your life , but sometimes it s necessary in the beginning while you start to attend therapy and perform other means of relieving your depression and anxiety . additionally , most antidepressants aren t addictive by nature because they re simply chemical balancers or mood stabilizers . the only medications you d have to worry about are controlled substances like ativan or
