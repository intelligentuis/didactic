louisiana usa","21592":"yep","21593":"well . . . it s especially important for people out on the country to cut their grass because we get wild critters that can eat you and come into your house kill you or your animals . they hide up in the grass . . . so that s one major reason why we cut our grass . the other reason . bugs would infest our houses . another reason is they can t get in and out of our driveways and we can t see over the grass . plus gardens and trees would die and more . there are multiple reasons to why we country folk definitely cut our dresses . people in the city ? i think they need to cut their grass for most of those reasons as well but country people got really bad with the animal part and bug part","21594":"valentine s day is soon .","21595":"i m doing pretty good

ask a few people about this place that i m talking about you probably can find out where it is but it s extremely expensive but totally worth it because his work is amazing even if it takes a year or so to get into his shop i would definitely consider going there . he also does before appointments to see what you want first before getting it and then he has a second appointment so it will be a process but exciting and totally worth it in the end . at least you will be getting a piece of work and actually getting something beautiful instead of going to someone cheap and it being super fast and not being done all the way and you spending a lot of money . not saying all tattoo artists other than him or like this now . there are other tattoo artists that are amazing as well","21611":"just ware on it . . and not keeping it up . but not always in a sense . . but just maybe it being out of date . keeping it s original self for so long and people knowing that in mind just automatically

sometimes in the evening to enjoy its beauty and just to take in the nature , to watch the boats come by and to look at the bridge . . . the giant skyscrapers and planes helicopters and more . there were also be periodically different events that happened up here . but most the time was peaceful and quiet . awesome place to visit . unfortunately my grandfather passed away a few years back plus my grandmother soon after sadly . . . they mean a lot to me . they partly raised me with my mom . they played a big role in my life . i love my grandparents . but this is a memory that i will always remember about him , my paw paw and i love going to this place while we were there one day he got down on one knee after making a joke that he saw a trash boat in the water got my attention because i wanted to see it turned back around and he was on one knee asking me to marry him . which the joke that he made was something similar to what my grandfather would say it was very touching , very sweet

me .","21620":"yeah . they are good . yeah !","21621":"i can hand write with both arms but not that great but i can throw with both arms ambidextrous in throwing","21622":"well if you want a tattoo done very beautifully and extreme detail i would make sure that you go to a very good artist and make sure that you pay good money to get that tattoo done . and i would look far and wide for a very good tattoo artist . i know there s one in miami florida that s extremely good that i definitely recommend but you have to make an appointment with him and honestly his appointments are probably so backed up that you would probably have to make a reservation a year ahead of time . but all i know is make sure that you have a really good artist and make sure that they know for sure how much detail that you want in your tattoo . i would stick around their shop for a few weeks before actually letting them tattoo on you or just check out their work for a couple of weeks and just see if that s the kind of stuff that you want in your skin . the way that they re doing that to people tattoos the detail . it s important to develop a relationship with your tattoo artist as well also in my opinion and which is what i did . but like i said just be careful and make sure you know what you want before getting it . because it ain t coming off your body unless you want to spend thousands of dollars in laser surgery and honestly one surgery does it fix it and sometimes it never does","21623":"i don t mind either","21624":"make sure you want what you want and make sure you really going to want it

of coins that you collect from your followers and just random viewers that visit your profile and see your answers that you have been asked from users . or it can be users that have asked you two questions . but basically you collect coins in a day . and every day that you get coins it adds up for the week and then it ranks you on the leaderboard every day but every week the coin start over basically they stock every day for days . those days count for your rank for that week . but the leaderboard updates every minutes but what i m saying is say you were to get it coins in a whole week it goes away at the end of the week . but say you were to get every day for seven days add that together that s how much you would get in a week . but like i said fire is points for ranked in your
