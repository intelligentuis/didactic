  Shes 21 almost 22, her boyfriend's cousin just moved to virginia . The cousin is younger but has a little infant to care for, the dad of the baby/ boyfriend is in the navy so he can provide for the baby and her. However she wants my friend and her boyfriend to move down there and lkve with her till the boyfriend of my friend saves up enough money to buy their own place. And my friend can stay there for free ( probably just help with the baby or around the house). But she (the cousin) asked that friends boyfriend gets a job or goes into the navy and probably pay only $50 for rent or something. However friends parents are controlling and over protective so they wouldnt necessarily be okay with her moving to a different state and staying with someone else let alone besides her boyfriend. She also doesnt have anyone there she knows, knows where anything is, and is worried about having to find new doctors and stuff If she is able to move.

  I try to answer everything unless it's something I can't understand, something that's really personal to me or the other person. Or something along the lines of hate or discrimination against me or someone else.

  ","
  It was party of five and stranger things along with the spin off, ""Good Trouble"" which focuses on Callie's and Marianna's life from the Fosters... but due to covid happening it paused the filming and production of the new seasons so theres no new episodes to watch
  "
890990,"
   Which is harder for you - Bearing a grudge, keeping malice or keeping a Secret
  ","
  Probably keeping secrets. Even tho I don't always reveal what they were or tell them to others. However there have been some secrets I knew that were important and should have been told to those people who were affected.
  "
890991,"
   Has any of your friends asked you  for your password in your dream and did you give it to them if they did

  Hello

890999,"
   Are you a RELIGIOUS or SPIRITUAL person?

  ","
  Your welcome ahah
  "
891008,"
   If you had to choose between going naked or having your thoughts appear in thought bubbles above your head for everyone to read, which would you choose?
  ","
  Having my thoughts appear above my head for everyone to read because theres no way I would ever feel comfortable walking around naked where perverts and weirdos can stare at my body and that.
  "
891009,"
   What's a food you hated as a kid, but love now?
  ","
  Not really a food, but a vegetable: peppers I hated every pepper you could think of and refused to eat anything containing them

891010,"
   Yeah 😎 Lauren because they operated me from my vesicle a few weeks ago
  ","
  Oh

  "
891013,"
   What sport would be the funniest to add a mandatory amount of alcohol to?
  ","
  Probably golf but I think someone already has created their own golf course recently that allows you to drink alchohol while playing golf and allows a golf cart that goes 25 to 30 miles per hour. Some celebrity but forgot who it was. Just look up beers get delivered by a drone and I'm sure you'll find the article.
  "
891014,"
   Mc Donald’s or Burger King?
  ","
  Mcdonalds
  "
891015,"
   If you could steal one thing without consequence what would it be?
  ","
  Someones ""heart ""/ ""love""
  "
891016,"
   do you have temporarily happiness?

  I believe everyone has a temporary happiness. You can't always be happy every single day of the year, and your emotions always change throughout the day probably

  Don't give up on life. And always give it one more night, you may feel like no one is listening or no one cares but trust me someone does!!!

I have a life and career that's more important to worry about than playing some kindergarten games. Anyway #StopBlair is what everyone really needs to look into and help!!! He made the boys travel to america without any health costs or insurance for the matter. Mikey ended up catching septus in his leg and almost lost his leg as it's a deadly infection!! Every day blair would call up to the hospital to try to have mikey released.

  It's not that I necessarily enjoy being single or not married.

And just hurting myself way worse in the process. ...

  It's a day when you come together with your family and friends and celebrate what you are most grateful for in life. It's about honoring those who faught for our freedom and keeping those less fortunate in your thoughts and hearts as well.

  ","
  We write and sing our own songs as well as cover music from other artists
  "

  ","
  Pretty well considering I could start my work early then have the rest of the day to do whatever I wanted to
  "
892009,"
   Aren't people homeschooled not smart?
  ","
  Not true, homeschooling allows children to learn at their own pace instead of getting stressed out when the teacher moves on to another subject
  "
892010,"
   But you in band and wealthy and young what pressure?
  ","
  Watch my new video where I explain /update about what's been going on...
  "
892011,"
   I have an uncle who lives in north hills cali, not far from LA and he has told me that things are pretty bad there. they are in the purple zone which mean its very serious, enough for lockdowns. yeah not a huge fan with the swab in the nose thing, it hurts me seeing others doing it.
  ","
  Her husband's family moved there. She eventually wants to move back bc she doesnt feel connected to the people here in Tennessee anymore. So shes been staying in cali for a few weeks with his family...
  "
892012,"
   It does?
  ","
  Yeah
  "
892013,"
   thanks so much and hopefully you will as well. (:
  ","
  Hopefully :) my one sister wanted to spend Thanksgiving together with the family but her husband is high risk and shes been in California... she wanted our family to get tested so she was able to do so. But fails to realize that 1. Some people aren't exactly comfortable with a big swab going up their nose to nearly the brain.
  
  2. If we fly to california or vice versa we would have to quarantine to be in the safe side and follow guidelines
  
  3. I'm pretty sure they want no more than 6 people at a gathering now bc they want to slow the spread. And our family is big so not everyone would be included
  
  4. I know she wants to be safe and all but I feel shes letting the ""fear"" from the media get to her a bit
  "
892014,"
   Ever kissed a guy?
  ","
  Yes
  "
892015,"
   You are welcome. and technically it is somewhat face to face just the window from their dining room is what is separating us. :) plus the weather is going to be great in the 70's so I am not complaining. year so far has been depressing but I am thinking positive, wishing that things will be better.
  ","
  Same here. I hope you enjoy the quality time you get with your parents however 😊
  "
892016,"
   You're a gem for being so.

  I’m learning to stop looking for happiness. People love to sell you this idea that once you achieve this, once you get that, once this happens, you will be ✨ happy ✨and the reason you’re not happy right now is because you don’t have these things that you’re chasing. But there is no pinnacle of life that you reach and then suddenly you’re immune to being sad and bad things don’t happen to you anymore. Life is hard. Life is sad. The world is deeply imperfect and unfair. And that is not going to change. Instead of looking for this before and after life where once you reach the after, you’re “happy”, I’m learning that fulfillment and a real sense of joy is found in the everyday and it is found in love. Not just the finding your soulmate type of love, but sacrificial love. The type of love you don’t just feel, but you practice. When you live your life for something greater than yourself. When your actions are all centered around bringing love to those around you. When loving yourself isn’t the end goal, but a necessary means for you to be able to love others more fully. When the goal of your life is to be happy, you will constantly be disappointed because happiness is a feeling that comes and goes. When the goal of your life is to love, you can attain that goal everyday regardless of what people do to you, how hard things are, or even if everything is falling apart, because the times it is hardest to love are the times when your love means the most. We as human beings were simply designed to give and receive love and when we are doing that is when we truly feel fulfilled, grounded, and alive ❤️

For example if the older girls (christina, katherine, lisa) went to go see a movie one week but they didnt include amy, me, and dani then the next time they would have to include us in their hangout like going out for icecream. Although most of us are all grown up. Getting married, moving to a new house and having children we are still pretty much in touch and try to help out and hangout whenever we can

   I wouldn't say that covid is fake I just think that the numbers are greatly exaggerated.
  ","
  It's just the media trying to scare everyone when it's really not that big of a deal
  "
892565,"
   Umm what? How could it be fake? Is the world flat too or?
  ","
  Just the statistics and ""proof"" doesnt make sense. Any normal human being who tested positive for the virus has to be quarantined up to 14 days or longer. However the president was only in the hospital for 3 days and was able to go out in public. Also there was news that an 87 year women tested positive for the virus they tested her every other day and counted her her results as a new case each time. Also a governor who was suppose to meet with with the president tested positive 30 minutes before the president arrived they tested him 30 minutes after he returned home with another covid test and he tested positive. Although it was a different ""brand "" shouldn't all tests/ vaccines have the same effect?? And then they're constantly changing the ""symptoms "" and that.

   How can you tell if you are having mental health issues?
  ","
  I think if the way you are feeling is not matching up with your life circumstances and also the way you're feeling is  inhabiting you from doing daily activities and living your life. Like if your life is going really badly and you're feeling really down or really anxious all the time I think that's pretty normal but if your life is going really well and you can't think of anything wrong but you feel really down or really anxious all the time that might be an indication! And if you feel so down and anxious all the time that it's stopping you from being able to do the things you want to do you might want to seek some help so you can live a better life. ❤

   1. When you receive a question, do clauses like  “don’t lie/be honest” affect the way you answer it?         2. Do you feel better not answering a question when it says “don’t have to answer if you don’t want” at the end?         BQ: Do you answer “bonus  questions”?
  ","
  I think it just depends on the question and if I actually feel like answering the entire part or elaborating on an answer. Some questions are just way to personal or I'm not familiar with how to exactly answer. And yes I do :)

  I’ve been heartbroken countless times. Over big things and small things. I feel things very deeply and attach quickly. You would think that after experiencing the pain of heartbreak so many times, it would get easier, but it doesn’t. Every time feels just the same. Crying on the bathroom floor. Not being able to fall asleep til 4am. Thinking through the whole story again and again and again. What went wrong? Could it have been any different? How did this happen? Why did this happen? I wrote this song “These Days” about that and I think it captures my experience of heartbreak perfectly 💔 watch the video at the link in my bio and click “My YouTube”

  1. Take a few deep breaths, relax my shoulders, and unclench my stomach and whatever else is tight in my body.
  
  2. Remind myself of the actual stakes of the situation e.g. am I going to die if this goes wrong? No. I am safe. I am loved. I matter. I am valuable. I am not a failure. I am not going to lose everything if this goes wrong.
  
  3. Usually I get to the conclusion that all I can do is try my best and even if things go horribly wrong, there's a way to fix it and I think of what that way is and find comfort in that 👍

   How to motivate yourself to excercise??? My health isnt good and I want to get active
  ","
  1. Don't make it a punishment for yourself in your mind or like something that you have to do or else you're a bad person lol the more pressure you put on yourself about it, the less motivation you'll have.
  
  2. Find ways to exercise that you actually like!!! I hate the gym and I hate lifting weights so instead of trying to force myself to do that I go on runs and do body weight excercises like push-ups and sit-ups bc I actually like those things! Find what is enjoyable to you.
  
  3. Start small. Don't try to run 6 miles everyday. It might feel dumb but just start out like 2 days a week doing something short and gradually build up so it feels manageable.
  "
892940,"
   How can you tell a person is toxic?
  ","
  I think when you've tried to communicate with them clearly and respectfully multiple times and their negative behavior doesn't change. People usually need a little time to change, but if you've given them clear feedback about what is unacceptable about their behavior and over time they still continue to do it and refuse to change, you have to take a step back from that person :/

   How to break a friendship with out hurting the other person? Is it possible?

  You can't control how other people feel or react to things so I would say don't focus on not hurting them. Instead focus on being honest and kind and respectful. If you tell them the honest truth about why you need to end the friendship and you do it in a respectful way, that is a very kind thing to do. Don't feel bad about it. Not everyone is supposed to be in our lives forever.

  It depends on the store and how crowded it is. If it's like walmart then I prefer to go to self check out just because they only have like 2 registers open half the time and the line is super long.

I think people send them because with the help of anonymous they can say/do whatever they want without the person knowing its them so the person cant see their actual true colors and intentions

   How good are you at overcoming bad habits? What is the biggest habit you have ever managed to quit?
  ","
  I'm not that good but I'm definitely getting better at overcoming or taking control of what needs to be handled. I used to let so many people that were toxic or clout chasers come into my life and I would abandon my boundaries and wishes just to make them happy which left me drained and hurt pretty much all the time. And since I stopped being friends with those type of people and been paying attention to my personal boundaries I've been way happier and at peace lol

  In-order traversal is very commonly used on binary search trees because it returns values from the underlying set in order, according to the comparator that set up the binary search tree. Post-order traversal while deleting or freeing nodes and values can delete or free an entire binary tree.

  48 hours due to traveling to europe and having to catch many flights and then take the bus and subways to the hotel and then figure out who was sleeping with who in what room and sorting out all our belongings and stuff.

Went to their older brothers wedding and i knew they were suppose to be there but didnt know if they were actually coming.

  The Lads. This group of friends is unlike any other. The 2am conversations where we feel safe to share some of our deepest heartache. The honest feedback we give each other when we don’t think we’re living up to God’s design for our lives. The support of each other’s incredible dreams (even though they are all so different). The never-ending group chats that constantly change names. The random trips / adventures. The weirdest humor. Feeling safe to be our complete, full selves...even the parts others reject. The rebellious and yet wholesome nature we all have. And our desire to help restore the many broken souls in this world.

  I used to see how many girls wore a size zero and had flawless skin with no breakouts and just the ""ideal perfect"" body on Instagram and when you compared me to them I didnt have a thing compared to them.

   Did you know that Slavery was a part of the economic structure of African societies for many centuries. The 1st traders to bring slaves across the Atlantic were from Portugal, & they bought there slaves from African tribal leaders. Black people in Africa had black slaves long before white people did
  ","
  And I heard that black people used to have white slaves as well in the past, still no one should EVER live a life like that or be treated horribly and inhumanely. We should all be loved and appreciated. Stop the discrimination and hating just because of a color of someones skin. All lives matter

  Because most of these beliefs happend centuries before lost of us where born and at the time society didnt have the technology or inventions we have to today to actually document half of these ""beliefs"" or things that happend. All they had was either the words they learned by heart to a story, old documents written on paper and Ink that may be long extinct or damaged and cave paintings etc. Many we didnt know how to decipher at the time and who knows if we even translated the cave paintings right or certain images. And those people who experienced these beliefs or heard the original story are way gone in life

  About a good 90%. I feel truly alive when things are going great, I'm not super stressed out or dealing with being in a toxic place with someone. When i can just enjoy the moment with family and friends and so what i live without there being some huge debate about it. And i can feel that way more often if people would just stop trying to make people upset and understand that not everyday is someone in a mood to put up with their shenanigans

  Learning a new language can be challenging and can take years of learning before you can read, speak and write it fluently. However our emotions, reactions, and expressions can be sometimes easier to read. If you're trying to learn new words and their meaning try using bigger words at times when you read or write, ask people what they mean if they use a word you're not familiar with in a conversation, look it up and read examples on how to use those words as well

   are people in poverty more likely to die young?
  ","
  Probably considering they dont have the necessities provided to them to ensure theyre healthy or not. Many people in poverty dont have homes to protect them from the harsh weather conditions which can also cause illnesses, illnesses if not treated can cause death and some people cant afford healthcare or ever receive it in their life, some people cant even eat for days because they have no money to provide food on the table for them in their family and if they do receive food from someone or a shelter it may not always be fresh and safe. Like our water as well some of us are not blessed to have safe, clean drinking water to drink, bathe in etc. So never take anything for granted because you never know how priviledge you are compared to others.

   Ohh okay that makes sense. I watched that video many times and was always wondering what they were doing, so I had to ask you. I feel comfortable asking you since you were there, and you're always so kind to me, so I figured I'd be extremely confident and ask you that question. So thank you for that

893830,"
   Can somebody explain to me why my menstruation  blood is dry?
  ","
  I'm not a doctor but
  
  Firstly blood if it’s fresh will be in a liquid like state. The longer you keep it out of the body the more thick it starts to become , that is because of the clotting factors and the platelets in the blood.
  
  Now i am assuming what you mean by dry blood is that they are clots. If so then it could be a lot of things. But one of the most common could be you have some problem with excessive coagulation. You will need to get a blood work done initially to see what could be the cause.
  
  Some times after there is not much bleeding but only shedding of the lining of the uterus which could be perceived as dried blood.

   Do you prefer the north in summer or the south in winter?
  ","
  Okay this question is pretty hard to answer considering most of my life I lived in northern California up until 2010 when we moved to southern California until 2015. And well winter in california was more like summer time in california. I never actually had to spend days where it was cold, snowing etc. Till we moved to Tennessee and experienced our first year of living through all weather conditions. However I still prefer to be in a sunny, warm area then a cold, freezing one.

  No I don't, in a way I feel it's something we all know is a huge issue in the world right now. And things shouldn't be changing so rapidly but we all just kind of shrug it off and pretend we cant see what's going on infront of our faces until it becomes something that cant really be fixed or solved easily. But even then we still dont care about the things we do that causes things to happen until theres nothing left to destroy

   Do you agree with the saying ""If you kill a murderer, the number of murderers in the world stays the same?"" Or would you say it's for the greater good to kill people who kill innocent people?
  ","
  Kind of a trick question bc if you kill someone. You're still considered a murderer  in the government's eye, even if it was a good reason as to why you did so. Such as a guy being a p.e.d.o.p.h.i.l.e and luring on young kids and you found out and killed that person and saved others from having to ever experience their child doing that or their victims knowing about it and thanking you ... so in a way the number of murderers will never decrease as long as someone is out there still killing people for good or just bc
  "
894149,"
   What are your thoughts on the death penalty?
  ","
  A good resolution to those who created crimes that should be punished more severe and get what they did done to them. Like if someone killed an innocent baby by shaking them to death then the same treatment should be used on them and give them a taste if their own medicine
  "
894150,"
   What are your thoughts on vigilantes? Do you think justice should be left to the authorities, or do you think if you can do some good and take down bad people, you should?
  ","
  In a way I feel they help keep the community a bit better and safe because they choose to keep an eye on possible danger and harm that can happen, which a lot of people consider them to be Karen's for complaining or calling the cops etc. But in reality if theres a large crowd of people that are partying and drinking and start to act rowdy its probably a good thing someone called it in bc what normally happens is someone gets injured or lost a life

   What if you move into an Apartment and at the stroke of midnight any door in the house leads to another country and whatever building you come out from in that country you'd have to return to it the same time you crossed over  if you want to get home. Will you try it or will you move out

  Exactly like give them a warning for example: hey taylor it's not nice to hit your brother in the face please stop doing that and tell him you're sorry or the next time you do you have to go sit in timeout. Then if the child does it again, ""taylor I asked you to stop hitting your brother as it's not nice and you refused to listen to mommy so now you have to sit in time out till I come and get you. Then once the child sits the number of minutes recommended for their age you go back ""taylor do you know why mommy ppl put you in time out"" child answers yes or no.. ""because you were hitting your brother and you know that's not a nice thing to do. Are you you sorry, child says sorry ""okay give me a hug "" etc.

894394,"
   Follow me for a follow back. Let me know who you are when you follow so I can follow back
  ","
  Alright :)
  "
894395,"
   Have you ever blushed for getting an answer right.
  ","
  Sometimes but not really lol
  "
894396,"
   Shoot even if I wasn't feeling this way my dishes going to wait I plan on being lazy today
  ","
  I wanted to get things done but not feeling like this I aint
  "
894397,"
   Do you like you some brown sugar?
  ","
  Yes I do!! Especially in baked beans or on ham
  "
894398,"
   How do you reciprocate, when someone praises you? Especially the guy in the friendzone,i call him friendzonal officer .
  ","
  I normally just smile and thank them for their compliment and that :)
  "
894399,"
   The reason I lost interests is I started doubting myself
  ","
  Yeah, I understand. I just became overwhelmed with writing and having classes that always wanted some sort of essay or presentation as well as the band became a bit too much at times.
  "
894400,"
   What's the best way to calm you down?
  ","
  Those tight hugs 🥺
  "
894401,"
   if someone gave you a pet snake would you keep it?
  ","
  Yes
  "
894402,"
   how to improve in singing?
  ","
  Practice a lot and always do what you believe in.
  "
894403,"
   Saying I used to write short stories when I was in school but I ended up quitting writing
  ","
  I used to love writing especially creative writing but sadly I just lost interest in story telling and having to write essays every week for class
  "

","
  Not sure
  "
894405,"
   What is the definition of ""self responsibility""? Just seeing if anyone can answer
  ","
  Meaning yourself as a person should be responsible in situations and do what's right rather than wrong. When others are not being very responsible towards themselves, others, or even things like a dog or property that doesnt belong to them
  "
894406,"
   How do you calm yourself when you’re angry. Some people have a mantra or phrase they repeat, some count to 10
  ","
  I normally just walk away and have some quiet time to think by myself for a while, I journal, go for a walk, meditate or even take a nice hot shower/ bath
  "
894407,"
   I don't know when I'll be done with it so far I go to over 11,000 words and I'm not entirely sure how many words I actually need to be consider a novel
  ","
  I'm not sure. I wrote short stories before
  "
894408,"
   How many teeth do you have?
  ","
  The average adult has 32 secondary (permanent) teeth during their lifetime. However if you get wisdom teeth removed like I have then its 28 depending on your mouth
  "
894409,"
   Same is probably why I'm laying in bed right now watching these creepy YouTube videos
  ","
  I did some dishes and other things but pretty much I just dont feel well to do anything at the moment
  "
894410,"
   Exactly I want my kids to be good hearted but I also want them to be cautious
  ","
  Yesss
  "
894411,"
   Like someone always told me it is what it is
  ","
  Yep
  "
894412,"
   I been scared lately because of that one reason
  ","
  Yeah I know but it will be alright just have faith
  "
894413,"
   Oh no, not them Lauren they never done anything wrong they are perfect
  ","
  😂 I was thinking back on the dumb stuff I used to do as a kid and I'm like I think we all did something similar or just as bad
  "
894414,"
   Why then you buyed them xd
  ","
  Bc I was always raised to ""buy an extra pair"" especially when it came to shoes because you'll never know when you're going to need new shoes. Mine have had tendencies of falling apart where the glue is suppose to hold it in tact for awhile (not fun getting water in your shoes or whatever else). So that's why I have a few that I dont wear, or they're like special occasions shoes that go with outfits I wear on holidays and that
  "
894415,"
   Yeah I know people like that and sometimes I want to knock them upside the head
  ","
  Same
  "
894416,"
   If I ever get done with my novel and I get lucky and it just turned into a movie I should give you a small part in it
  ","
  Awe
  "
894417,"
   Do you wear a retainer?
  ","
  No, I was suppose to discuss the possibility of having a retainer for my lower teeth because they were spacing and I didnt know why ( thought it was just the wisdom teeth pushed them and shifted to make room) I didnt know there was another cause on why they were spacing till I switched dentists and they did xrays and an examination found out I have a receding gumline issue going on and I have to get a procedure done to help ""fix"" it a little bit
  "
894418,"
   😂
  ","
  😊
  "
894419,"
   What do you do all day?
  ","
  Normally work lol
  "
894420,"
   Yeah keyword hopefully
  ","
  Mhm
  "
894421,"
   Sometimes just for fun
  ","
  Maybe
  "
894422,"
   But they call me yesterday so hopefully all this will get straightened out because I don't want to start being on insulin
  ","
  Yeah
  "
894423,"
   Big deal so has been married so what people need to get over it
  ","
  We do many dumb things when we are young and in our twenties even
  "
894424,"
   Yeah and what they do is actually your fault because you the one that taught them to be that way you pretty much gave them the go-ahead that it's okay when I have kids yeah I would like to buy them things but I want them to know the value of what they're getting
  ","
  I want my children to be kind to everyone and always try to help when needed
  "
894425,"
   Oh believe me I know that feeling all too well me I am not a morning person and when I wake up in the morning sometimes I literally feel like I got hit by Mack truck and backed over
  ","
  Yeahhh that's how I feel
  "
894426,"
   Sad thing is I don't see it stopping
  ","
  Me either
  "
894427,"
   It’s ok but it’s good that you answer
  ","
  Thank you for understanding
  "
894428,"
   It would be something interesting to see
  ","
  True
  "
894429,"
   Dang that sucks
  ","
  Yeah
  "
894430,"
   Why don't people listen when you tell them to stop doing something?
  ","
  Bc they dont care about the consequences or outcome of what they do.
  "
894431,"
   I enjoy these conversations even though half the time I forget what we were talking about in the first places 😂
  ","
  Haha
  "
894432,"
   I hope everyone has an amazing Friday 🤗☺️🙃
  ","
  Have an amazing saturday chelsea
  "
894433,"
   maybe after November everything will go back to normal fingers crossed
  ","
  Hopefully
  "
894434,"
   Yeah the only reason I didn't get the machine because my doctor hadn't signed off on it yet
  ","
  Oh I understand
  "
894435,"
   Heck look at Mendez brothers parents were loaded gave them everything they wanted look what they did.
  ","
  Basically you're setting up your child to be a bully to less fortunate children
  "
894436,"
   Dang whats wrong ?
  ","
  I wake up feeling like my whole body got yeeted off a cliff. And groggily like just like I haven't slept in years. Then people who are like morning people always wanting things or trying to talk and bother you is annoying and they dont understand that people are like not a morning person or they go to sleep later than you or whatever else
  "
894437,"
   What's he got against Chad lol
  ","
  Probably one of those oh chad isnt a good person bc he had 2 wives before
  "
894438,"
   worse when its people you know very well and I think its one of the reasons I am the way I am
  ","
  Yeah
  "
894439,"
   i had all 4 mine removed
  ","
  At first they only took 2. The upper ones were still in my sinuses at the time and not coming through
  "
894440,"
   Sweet!
  ","
  I dont think I could play the part of a vampire unless I was like Alice's child ahah
  "
894441,"
   do you have any Gucci  clothing
  ","
  No I do not
  "
894442,"
   lol you good
  ","
  Haha
  "
894443,"
   If the fonz from happy days snapped his fingers, would you run to him???
  ","
  Probably not
  "
894444,"
   I got the test strips, lancets, alcohol swabs but if it got to send me the machine
  ","
  Well that's good you got most of the supplies
  "
894445,"
   Yeah and that is why their kids become brats or worse
  ","
  Exactly
  "
894446,"
   What you up to?
  ","
  Just really sore and feeling meh.
  "
894447,"
   By what artist?
  ","
  Drew jacobs
  "
894448,"
   Are you friends with bella Thorne?
  ","
  Nope, not at all
  "
894449,"
   i just know its ridiculous
  ","
  Yeah
  "
894450,"
   Oh okay
  ","
  Yep
  "
894451,"
   Which role would you want?
  ","
  Play a part in the wolfpack
  "
894452,"
   What two questions would you ask to get the most information about who a person truly is?
  ","
  1. What do you dream about having in life?
  
  2. Have you ever killed someone ? .-.
  "
894453,"
   It sucks
  ","
  It definitely does
  "
894454,"
   lol
  ","
  Okay I'll stop lol
  "
894455,"
   Hopefully I get soon
  ","
  I believe you got your supplies already?
  "
894456,"
   Lol it truly is
  ","
  Mhm
  "
894457,"
   thanks I will need it
  ","
  No problem
  "
894458,"
   Nothing wrong with spoiling a little bit yeah buy them nice things do it once in awhile though but some parents get obssesive with it
  ","
  Yeah especially those high class people
  "
894459,"
   have you done that already I can't remember if you have or not
  ","
  No just had wisdom teeth removal :/
  "
894460,"
   Yeah ig they did it it would definitely be new actors
  ","
  Yeah.. I'll gladly take on a role ahaha
  "
894461,"
   The main question though is will it happen
  ","
  Most likely not for a few months or years
  "
894462,"
   😂
  ","
  We have so many deep conversations late at night
  "
894463,"
   How often you get creep messages? I barely get any 1 or 2 a day
  ","
  Pretty often sadly. It's kinda annoying
  "
894464,"
   Is that enough chicken for your tummy desires?
  ","
  Lol depends how hungry I am, and how many i have.
  "
894465,"
   Do you think you have the potential to become one of the greatest singers one day?
  ","
  Maybe, but I may still be highly under rated and not get the credit I deserve. But I'll be happy just having the love and support of the baddies throughout the years that I continue to put music out into the world and other things.
  "
894466,"
   🥳🥳🥳
  ","
  Lisa -
  
  You are such a UNIQUE WOMAN !!!! You have so many great opposing traits I don’t know how they all exist in one person ! You are so laid back and easy to be around but also so strong in what you believe. You are literally the weirdest person I’ve ever met but also extremely deep and introspective. You are super fun and will dance for like 5+ hours straight but also extremely intelligent. You are so analytical and think so critically but also so kind and compassionate. You are the biggest bleeding heart I’ve ever heard of even you though you try to pretend like you’re not <3 You try SO HARD to be the best person you can be and you are always thinking of others. You deserve so much more than what you take and I hope one day you will truly believe that 💖💖 love you so much !!!

  u bully me everyday but it makes me stronger <3 you have grown into such an upstanding young man and it’s so beautiful to see :’) Thanks for always being down to come over and help me when I need it and for always challenging me to be better. You are driven, extremely intelligent, caring, and a great role model to those around you. You have such a good head on your shoulders and I’ve never been worried about u doing dumb things and being a wild teen, good job. Love you ❤️

  ","
  Michael used to be in our band when it first started but didnt like the girly related side of it ( hes now a father of two little girls lol and more to come eventually. So he stopped being in the band. However he does play guitar and handles all the security and tech related things at our shows. Alex, hes not really into playing or singing. Christian plays guitar and always is messing around with the strings and that, he helped sing in a few episodes dani and I did when were younger for the sugar & spice show. Nick has a low harmony and has been extremely helpful in the band especially after dani left and we needed a second person for our videos. And joey I dont think hes really into music as much, hes more of a sports and twitch streamer than anything. But overall all my brothers can sing pretty well. But only like 3 are involved in music and they all help and come along at times when we are touring. Just the older brothers are more helpful and useful ahaha

   If you're in a public place, do you sometimes feel the strong gaze of somebody else but when you turn around you don't see anyone.

  At times I would feel like someone is watching me or like behind me or something. I guess its just anxiety in general and a phobia from what I was told. Like going down in the basement by yourself and running quickly back up the stairs because you feel like something is watching you and may pop out and grab you.

   The state of California needs to start cutting down 25 000 more  trees a day.
There are too many trees here.
  ","
  Its not bc theres tom many trees, its bc it hardly rains in california and california is always hot and sunny most of the time which causes the land and atmosphere to become humid, hot and incredibly dry. Without water the ground becomes to hot... think about cooking. You were cooking a piece of meat in a skillet in grease. The flame makes it hot which cooks the raw meat and makes the grease hot. Take the meat out and leave the grease in the pan and the stove on. What happens? The grease and the skillet are hot and the grease starts to splatter everywhere. Now say u paid no attention to the skillet filled with grease or put anything in there then it eventually starts a fire..  same thing with the rain and climate in california and other factors - no rain+ dryness + heat = wildfires even a simple thing like someone making a small fire can cause it to spread

  My mom is a teacher and vocalist and taught us how to sing and play instruments at a very young age. I was a high harmony for a bit when I was younger but lisa eventually passed me. Then for years as I grew up I just kept practicing my range and breath control (I used to get choked off or my voice would always cracked). Eventually after taking lessons for weeks and years of practice and training I was finally able to hit the high harmonies with lisa again and I believe I can range higher than her as well now

   If you found a baby left on your doorstep would you raise it like your own?
  ","
  No I would take it in, feed it and clean it up then contact the authorities about finding a baby at my doorstep and let them take the baby into custody. Because that's what the safe haven laws apply : take it somewhere safe like a fire station, police station or church and that's why theres boxes to put the baby in and no questions would be asked. However if a random stranger just abandons their baby at the doorstep of someone else's and that person finds a baby by law you must report it to the police and let them have the child while they search for the parents and the reason why they abandoned their child. Their will also be an investigation in the case to see if there is any reason why she would abandoned the child. And then at the end of the day it's up for the children services to place the child up for adoption and will be in their care

  I dont like today's rap bc it's mostly about sex, alchohol,  violence etc. But if I write a song that has a rap verse in it I do rap because it's more on feelings that are relatable. And I always get the rap verses for the band because I'm just good at doing so.

  Theres a lot that goes into bring a good singer. I would just say practice as much as you can and dont let anyone interfere with what you enjoy doing. Try to find your vocal range - if you're attempting to reach a low or high note it can cause you to get choked off and loose your breath or even damage your vocals. Also try to stay on the correct key if possible

  ","
  In order to build up credit and that you have to own a credit card. To buy a car or house or any place that requires credit. Or you have to have a bill in your name. My professor always told the class to get a credit card and each month buy a pack of gum or something that's like 10- 20 dollars worth and you can easily pay back to build up credit cards. Dont ever use your credit card to buy things you dont have money for. For example black Friday shopping...

  Work to live. My family wasnt always as successful and had a nice house and fenced in yard. My parents met in college, and struggled a bit. I think Michael and Christina can recall living in a small duplex at one time. Plus we all had to share bedrooms or bathrooms (girls had there own bathroom as the boys had theirs) it wasnt until 2015 the house started to split where Michael, christina, katherine  lisa and amy all lived in an apartment together and alex, me, dani, christian. Nick and joey lived at our parents home. Then michael got a job as a realtor and moved out, christina got married and had her own house. Dani moved in with emmyn and his family at the time. Katherine & lisa shared a house but kath just moved. And then amy, arielle and I have our own house as well.

And it can also be bad because say you breakup then your personal life can interfere with your work life or cause arguments and stuff at work that will most likely lead to one of you getting fired or moved to another location
