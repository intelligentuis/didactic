   What do you think of Gender X? Parents are being able to put “gender x” on their child’s birth certificate after birth, rather than boy or girl.
  ","
  Eh, this is such a huge topic in today’s society. I mean you can’t chose your child gender. So putting x on their birth certificate is not really the way to go about it. You never know how your child might feel as they get older and understand more. That should be a choice they make when their older imo

   Did you know when someone gains weight their fat cells expand larger until they can’t expand anymore so they duplicate into more fat cells? That is why when someone becomes overweight or obese & they lose the weight it’s easier for them to gain the weight back, that why you should never get fat.

   ""inappropriate"" is a subjective term. What's inappropriate to one person may not be inappropriate to another. So, there is no basis for your ""it's not meant for inappropriate questions"" theory, because it's subjective :) So now that that's out of the way. Answer the fucking question :)
