been exploring it and it s been amazing . . . . which says a lot coming from someone who thought that believing in anything bigger or beyond us from the celestial front was ridiculous . did not go any sort of traditional route but i am learning so much more about myself than i think i ever have . also , actively expanding my career , making healthier eating choices , and trying to welcome more positive energy into my life home . next on my list that s been hanging over my head like an old dead goose is decluttering . got too much crap that doesn t serve me anymore .","716849":"over night","716850":"time is literally the only thing i can say really helps . it sucks to hear , but i have tried many things in the past , proving to myself , time is really the ultimate healer . with

of miracles can come out of a shitty situation .","716851":"yikes . my ocd triggers intrusive thoughts to linger so there would be many mixed messages up in there . only i would be able to judge what
