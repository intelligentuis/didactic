normal reactions and behaviors being played out as some sort of mental illness.\n  \n  unfortunately, being mentally ill has become some sort of a sick trend, and people are quick to self diagnose typical moods and feelings when they're not actually abnormal.\n  \n  i used to have panic attacks everyday when i was trying to adjust to change -

people who aren't afraid to voice their opinions and embrace their individuality with full force.\n  \n  my boyfriend is one of those kinds of people. he has strong opinions but only offers them if asked. he likes playing the devil's advocate to challenge other people's opinions. he's not afraid to tell people his honest feelings, and he's well aware of how weird and geeky he is and embraces it completely.\n  ","423057":"\n  my new job starts on the 23rd of october, allegedly. they want me to start next monday but it was extremely short notice and i don't think i'll be able to start that soon.\n  ","423058":"\n  you'll have to be more specific. which aspects of my opinions are inaccurate, and how does that make me a spineless person?\n  \n  because right now, your words are empty and meaningless without justification.\n  ","423059":"\n  don't trust people just because they're offering you something you need at the time.\n  \n  when i was younger, i was naive enough to trust certain people because they were giving me something i wanted, and i thought they had my best interests in mind. it turns out they were just using me to advance their own gains, so i immediately cut them out of my life. these days, it takes a lot of time and effort for someone to gain my trust because i don't trust in other people's motives.\n  ","423060":"\n  unfortunately, that's a common side effect of depression: unwavering loneliness, regardless of the support system behind you.\n  \n  even though i've had support throughout the years, i still have moments where i feel desperately alone and as if no one understands and nothing will get better. depression is an isolating disorder because it makes loneliness feel like your only friend and forces you to distance yourself from people who actually care about you.\n  ","423061":"\n  i'd rather just be myself, whether that means i'm blending into the crowd or standing out from the crowd.\n  \n  i've always found it difficult to define myself, but i've always sought to live my life on my own terms rather than live my life according to what society expects of me. as a result, there are some aspects of me where i do blend in, but i also stand out in other aspects too. it's difficult to really define.\n  ","423062":"\n  i'm a sensitive son of a bitch, so a lot of movies have made me cry, lol.\n  \n  the only one that comes to mind right now is the notebook. the first time i saw that movie, i ugly cried for a very long time.\n  ","423063":"\n  i believe in the paranormal, like ghosts and spirits and whatnot. i've had a few experiences with ghosts that solidified my opinion, as there was no other explanation for the things i saw.\n  \n  i also really enjoy watching paranormal shows. i think some of them are exaggerated, but they're interesting to watch.\n  ","423064":"\n  i'm not self-centered at all, and most of the time, i actually hate myself, lol.\n  \n  my life mainly centers around my friends and boyfriend. however, i've also been trying to do things for myself as well because my therapist has been teaching me the value of self-care and kindness.\n  ","423065":"\n  i'm fairly honest with myself, so there's nothing i'm pretending not to know. it's better to be aware of your environment and relationships instead of living in denial. you're not doing yourself any favors by refusing to acknowledge if there's a problem in your life.\n  ","423066":"\n  that's not weird at all, and in my opinion it's actually normal - i do the same exact thing because i'm paranoid that people will be looking into my window and watching me, so i close the shade every night.\n  ","423067":"\n  i think my answers are generally the same whenever you ask this question because my interests don't really change much over time.\n  \n  i like receiving personal questions most of all -

someone who probably means nothing to you - to the point where you're judging the content of their character based on their sexual history.\n  \n  i wouldn't necessarily call you a \"bad\" person, but i do believe you need an attitude adjustment. men aren't entitled to treat women like garbage just because they may have had an extensive sexual history. if you genuinely believed in gender equality, then you would treat these women with the same respect you would treat reserved women.\n  ","423107":"\n  i would wish for a large sum of money to come my way so that i could fulfill my dream of moving out of my parents' house into my own home with my boyfriend down south.\n  ","423108":"\n  no, that's not true at all ~~\n  \n  your sexual history won't matter to the right person who walks into your life, and you're going to know eventually who that person is and what they mean to you. you won't feel the need to sleep around anymore and you'll be satisfied in that relationship.\n  ","423109":"\n  i'm always honest.\n  ","423110":"\n  so far, so good. it's been an incredibly busy few weeks since autumn began, and i'm hoping it calms down soon.\n  \n  i'm happy that the weather has been chillier, though! i can't stand the heat, so the past week or so has been pleasant. my boyfriend and i had a fire with some brews the other night, which was fun and relaxing.\n  ","423111":"\n  i either love my appearance or i hate my appearance, depending on how i feel that day.\n  \n  i haven't been happy with myself lately, and i've really been debating on shaving my head.\n  ","423112":"\n  even though i'm sure you already follow them, here are a few of my closest askfm friends:\n  \n\n   @youcuntx\n  \n\n   @princess_tal\n  \n\n   @LAKocis\n  \n\n   @Courrtana\n  \n\n   @dovbts\n  \n\n   @HeartOfStitches\n  \n\n   @littlerouge_\n  \n\n   @slydexicc\n  \n\n   @jenchaotic\n  \n\n   @my_name_isnt_eric\n  \n","423113":"\n  i prefer my boyfriend, who is neither a \"\"fat\"\" boy or a fuck boy.\n  ","423114":"\n  i usually ingest absurd amounts of caffeine.\n  ","423115":"\n  psychology, sociology, and anthropology -

Any tips how I can overcome these thoughts\n  \n  --\n  \n  trust me, i understand completely how you feel. my boyfriend is the same way -- he's good looking, intelligent, and charming -- so it's hard for me to really believe that he chose *me* out of the pool of available people. he always tells me that i'm attractive, but i honestly don't see it and i disagree with him.\n  \n  however, that doesn't mean your boyfriend doesn't love you or feels sorry for you. often our perceptions of ourselves are different than reality, and everyone has different taste. he probably genuinely feels that way towards you, but because you can't see it, you think that he can't be telling the truth.\n  \n  you have nothing to worry about, friend. i'm sure your relationship is genuine!\n  ","423124":"\n  i

tattoos that hold no meaning. for example, my linkin park tattoo is extremely meaningful to me because the band saved my life when i was a teenager, and their music has always been a source of support growing up.\n  \n  on the other hand, my coffee tattoo is fairly meaningless as it's just an indication of my love for coffee. however, it's an amazing tattoo and i'n still so enthralled by it.\n

 mental illness in general, even if it's towards common illnesses like depression and anxiety. while depression \/ anxiety are more broadcasted globally, they're still relatively misunderstood by society and often people don't believe they deserve help because they're not depressed \"enough\" or anxious \"enough.\"\n  \n  that's just depression and anxiety, too. other more complex disorders like personality disorders and psychotic disorders are much more stigmatized and misunderstood.\n  ","423134":"\n  considering i am presently dating a mentally ill person, yes.\n  \n  someone's illnesses do not define the type of person they are. while dealing with mental illness is a hurdle to overcome, if you're with the right person who understands your struggles, it makes it easier to handle.\n  ","423135":"\n  psychiatric medication saves lives, including my own. i would have been dead one year ago if it wasn't for psych meds; they've completely turned my life around, as well as

entire life, they grow up believing that they deserve further abvse and neglect. if someone enters their life offering them emotional support and security, it will seem foreign to this person and they

lot of controversy since its release, and it's had a profound impact on teenagers in today's society.\n  \n  the most extreme example of this are the examples of teenagers who have completed svicide

seeking out help and support if you needed it, and his death was contradictory to everything he's been telling his fans.\n  \n  i felt angry because i felt lost and helpless after his death - there was nothing i could do, and i was angry at myself because i feel like there was something i should have done, but as an insignificant fan, there was nothing i could do. i grew up feeling such an intimate connection to chester that i felt i knew him personally, even though i only met him once.\n  \n  but i was also filled with sorrow that washed away my anger. he was in pain, he's always been
