   don't get more tattoos you are very beautiful as is and your skin is so soft and nice, it makes a statement without saying a word. Tattoos will get old and you will be stuck with them forever, your values will evolve and what you like today will not seem as important. trust me it's true.

   the problem isn't so much the gun laws, it's the people who are supposed to enforce them, if they're not following through on what they're supposed to you get the people that fall through the cracks, the question is how do we get government agencies to stop letting people fall through cracks

  Okay so there was a guy on here named spencer, he doesnt come on as often anymore.  But one day i really wanted a new name on here cause calling by my real name was too boring for me.

Then a few people and i would always come up with ways to use boom, such as ; boomtastic, boomers, boomerangs ect.
  
  Then i was fucking around and talking like Shakespeare and lady boometh was the name i came up with lol  i tried going back to boom but people got mad ):
  "
623707,"

My bf forgot his ID and so i had to go in by myself and walk around looking for drugs. The male dancer was the nicest guy ever. He knew i was taken, and goes ""well, of course you are.. youre just gorgeous"" my bf asked me to come out as quick as i could and so when i was walking out, the male dancer was doing his thing, i said bye but he got down from the stage gave me a huge hug and said, bye beautiful.

  Writing down your goals is a great way to start then by picking one big goal to work towards but also write down small goals that lead to that big goal. Then when you complete a goal, you can check it off and youll feel such satisfaction from it!! Also need to understand that success comes from failure, so dont be afraid to fail.

  I wrote this;
  
  1. The Kitchen – Night
  
  (Stormy Billups walks into the kitchen with anunopened wine bottle in her hand, while her husband, Billie Billups was sitting at the dinning room table.)
  
  Stormy Billups:(opens up a drawerangrilyfinding the wine opener)I can’t stand the way your family looks at me. (pops open the cork)They always look at me like I’m less than them.(pours wine into a glass and starts sipping it, while leaning on the counter.)
  
  Billie Billups:(gets up from the table and walks over to Stormy)What do you mean, babe?(grabs a glass and pours himself some wine.)You’re my amazing wife,(touches her hand to hold it)how would they think less of you?
  
  Stormy Billups:(pulls away from Billie and walks to the dinning table and sits down)I want to be more than that, I want to be more than a trophy wife who takes care of the kids all day and ends up looking like Honey Boo Boo. I want my name to mean something.
  
  Billie Billups:When we met you were perfectly fine with all the vacations, and shopping and then being a mother. What changed now?
  
  Stormy Billups:People say my name and they just say I’m so and so’s husband, I want people to say my name and be like, ‘oh, she does this, and this and she is also married to so and so,’ I want it to be a bonus being married to you, not just all that I am.
  
  (Billie looks down at his glass and twirls his wine glass.)
  
  Stormy Billups:I love being a mom(touches Billie’s knee)but when I go to those Parent – Teacher events, I want to say more than I’m a housewife.
  
  Billie Billups:What do you want than babe?
  
  Stormy Billups:(arisesup from her seat with passion)I wanna be heard!
  
  Billie Billups:Heard how though?
  
  Stormy Billups:(makes Billie stand up with her)I want to capture the world with my words, I want to be able to write and tell stories. I want to show the world what my mind can imagine.
  
  Billie Billups:What can I do?
  
  Stormy Billups:Just support me, and trust me.

   Longest you've gone without food
  ","
  I was very very sick my senior year, and i couldnt eat anything that didnt make me have insane stomach pain and usually ended up making me throw up. So i went about 4 weeks without food until i started throwing up blood and i went to the hospital. I was only about 72 pounds. And thats why i started smoking weed ? weed made it easier for me to eat and wasnt painful, if i had to throw up it wasnt painful.
  
  (This is also why im obsessed with food, i was very sick for over 4 years and i couldnt eat anything, this last year is the first year i didnt have any problems)

  How people dont see evolution as a possible thing.. like im not saying we are from monkeys/primates. Im just saying bacteria is evolving everyday, every second. Theres been studies on multiple species that are evolving as we speak. I look at it as species adapting to their environment, learning different skills to have a better life.

If i did all the stuff i did in high school and there was social media, i would have gotten kicked out of every school hahaha the competition is so much higher but at the same time kids arent even learning half of the shit i was learning in school.

   Are r*pe jokes ever funny?
  ","
  Fav rape joke; Now, speaking of rape, do you know what I wonder? I wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole. These are the kind of things I think about when I'm sitting home alone and the power goes out. I wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole. I mean per capita, I know the populations are different.
  
  Most people think it's the equator: I think it's the north pole. People think it's the equator because it's hot down there, they don't wear a lot of clothing, guys can see women's tits, they get horny and there's a lot of fucking going on.
  
  That's exactly why there's less rape at the equator: because there's a lot of fucking going on. You can tell there's a lot of fucking at the equator, take a look at the population figures. Billions of people live near the equator. How many Eskimos do we have? Thirty? Thirty-five? No one's getting laid at the north pole, it's too fucking cold.
  
  Now, the biggest problem an Eskimo rapist has: trying to get wet leather leggings off a woman who is kicking. Did you ever try to get leather pants off of someone who doesn't want to take them off? You would lose your hard-on in the process. Up at the north pole your dick would shrivel up like a stack of dimes.
  
  That's another thing I wonder. I wonder, does a rapist have a hard-on when he leaves the house in the morning, or does he develop it during the day while he's walking around looking for somebody? These are the kind of thoughts that kept me out of the really good schools

  Age doesnt matter after youre an adult.

One was this demonic chucky that chased me and killed everyone that tried to help me and i had to kill to save myself. Another one was the earth was on fire, the streets were blood and ash was falling down like snow and behind me someone says ""satan won"" and i woke up.

   Answer HONESTLY - how do you react in an argument/confrontation?

1) Immediately admit your faults and be the first to apologise

2) Stand your ground, and do not admit your fault until it's all calmed down (even if you know you're wrong)

3) Shout and cry

4) Avoid it or stay as quiet as you can

-Stay awesome classy peeps-
  ","
  Religion drives me insane. Like its actually crazy. To believe that we were all born sinners but if we ask for forgiveness we will be ok, is just nuts.
  
  You can murder people and then just ask for forgiveness and everything is fine. All you have to do is apologize. You can be hitler and just apologize and he would go to heaven. When you go to court you have to put your hand on a Christian bible to swear the truth - a person is gonna tell the truth if they want to tell the truth not because they put their hand on a book and made a wish.. religion is crazy too me. And i think we need to just stop using it.

  Thats like asking someone why their skin is black, white, tan, or whatever or asking someone why they are fat like 1. Its rude. 2. Its called genetics. 3.

How do take a miserable person with no control of their lives and tell them with a straight face 'ah you cant do drugs, you cant do that baby. All drugs are the perfect solution to all the problems you have right now.' How do you beat that? Drugs are so fucking good, that theyll ruin your life."" - louis CK.

  I havent seen the report but they have been trying to figure this out before i was even born. I dont know how far they have come with trying to make this happen, but i do know its been a work in progress for years. I dont really believe in 2029 is when it will happen, but at the same time like i said i dont know how far theyve come in research. I know bio engineering has gotten very advanced in the last 20 years. I know Sweden has figured out how to make a baby without a women in a bubble incubator.

   So let me guess this right one more time:People can't complain about politicians because they can't do better and if they don't aspire to run for political office.Despite the fact that they're supposed to represent you and their salary is payed by your and fellow countrymen's tax dollars ?
  ","
  This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders. Term limits ain't going to do any good; you're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So, maybe, maybe, maybe, it's not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here... like, the public. There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody: 'The Public Sucks. Fuck Hope'

   I do think that politicians should be held accountable though by the media and people and be criticized when they do wrong.Just because one isn't a politicians,does not mean that they don't have the right to criticize a politician.
  ","
  I wasnt saying that, it just pisses me off when people speak as if they could do better and are just little keyboard warriors. Being a politician isnt easy, its not like they are baking a cake and sometimes the cake is a little burnt. Like they are trying to run a government.
  
  I just hate how people argue and get angry like if you are that passionate about it, do something with that passion.
  "
627022,"
   Rant?
  ","
  You know what really grinds my gears is when people complain about politicians. Like they dropped out of the sky, and didnt come from American homes, American schools, or American jobs. These people didnt pop out of the vagina in a navy suit with a little American flag pin and holding a tiny flag. There first words weren't ""God bless American, and no place else."" They are just normal human beings, the only difference is they decided to take a stand and go after what they believe in. Stop complaining about them when its because of our society that they are the best to offer. If you could do better, fucking do something about it. Stop ranting and bitching on social media, go get an education, throw a fucking fundraiser, and do something about it. The only way theres gonna be a change is if you get off your fat ass and put some damn clothes on, put fucking twitter away and get out there.

  ","
  They'll say, ""You can't joke about rape. Rape's not funny."" I say, ""Fuck you, I think it's hilarious. How do you like that?"" I can prove to you that rape is funny. Picture Porky Pig raping Elmer Fudd. See? Hey, why do you think they call him ""Porky,"" eh? I know what you're going to say. ""Elmer was asking for it. Elmer was coming on to Porky. Porky couldn't help himself, he got a hard-on, he got horny, he lost control, he went out of his mind.""
  
  I believe you can joke about anything. It all depends on how you construct the joke. What the exaggeration is, what the exaggeration is. Because every joke needs one exaggeration; every joke needs one thing to be way out of proportion.

   So if a step brother married his step sis you wouldnt think it was incest??
  ","
  Incest: sexual relations between people classed as being too closely related to marry each other.
  
  the crime of having sexual intercourse with a parent, child, sibling, or grandchild.
  
  Step siblings are not in that category.

  I should also say about pregnancy is that some girls only need to have sex one time and they get pregnant. Some girls are extremely fertile. There's girls who can have sex 200 times and never get pregnant.
  
  For me, i didnt have sex a lot and its not easy for me to get pregnant according to my dr.
  "
627285,"
   How come you didn't get pregnant by then

  Because im not a fucking idiot and i didnt fuck everybody like wtf. Believe it or not but i barley had sex in high school. The people i did have sex with were very much into me and we were together and we always discussed what we would do if i got pregnant. Most of high school i was in a long distance relationship so i wasn't sleeping with anyone. After high school, i started dating someone and we stayed together for 3 years and we made sure i never got pregnant. Like i said, i wasnt a slut.

  thank you so much for that, that was one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me. I truly believe the best friendships come from struggles and overcoming them. We have been through some shit, and we both have been treated like shit but look at us now - we are strong. You have become one of those people i can talk to about anything, and its awesome to have someone like that. You taught me i can forgive and love someone no matter what happened in the past. You stay beautiful sweet hunny buns. Dont let anyone bring you down. You deserve happiness. ❤
