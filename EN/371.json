"},"Answer":{"398083":"\n  no, if you're already healthy then wearing a mask won't affect you, and it's better to save those resources for those who are at risk of getting the virus and health care workers.\n  \n  i've been washing my hands, sneezing into tissues, using hand sanitizer, opening doors with paper towels, etc etc.\n  ","398084":"\n  if both partners are supportive of the activity, then i see nothing wrong with it.\n  ","398085":"\n  no, it's because i hate my body and don't want to expose to anyone how disgusting i am. lmaoo.\n  ","398086":"\n  no, i'm not making an onlyfans account.\n  ","398087":"\n  i remember reading a few articles about the subject a couple of years ago when i was initially learning about problems within the sex industry.\n  ","398088":"\n  i'm not exactly sure what your intentions are at this point, but if we're summing up this discussion, i should note that afterwards i discussed consent. there's little consent in terms of porn and prostitution, which is why i made a separate paragraph in my initial response discussing the difference between things like onlyfans & porn\/prostitution.\n  ","398089":"\n  the initial question i was asked was about onlyfans & sex workers. lol.\n  ","398090":"\n  my prior answer was about consent in the sex industry. i've worked for below minimum wage as well, and i believe i do understand the parallel you're making. but just because the same can be said about every industry doesn't mean that the problems in the sex industry aren't significant too.\n  ","398091":"\n  i apologize for giving off that impression, i'm definitely not shaming anyone because i have friends who are sex workers and i support their ventures.\n  \n  it's difficult for me to really describe the distinction because like you said, some people use sites like onlyfans to get out of poverty as well. but i think what it comes down to is consent. there's seldom consent involved in sex work like porn or prostitution, meanwhile when people sell pictures and videos, they're giving their own consent to release that content to subscribers (unless they're being extorted or something).\n  \n  hopefully this makes it clearer.\n  ","398092":"\n  i never said anything about one thing being better than the other. i just said there was a distinction between selling photos & videos online from working as a porn actor or a prostitute. a lot of people in the latter professions fell into it for one reason or another and feel as though there's no way out.\n  ","398093":"\n  pockets on women's jeans are useless, lmaoo. i can normally never fit anything in them unless i put my phone in my back pocket (which i seldom do).\n  ","398094":"\n  i agree.\n  ","398095":"\n  my three biggest interests are true crime, writing, and video games.\n  \n  i've been interested in them all for as long as i can remember tbh. i've always loved writing as a creative outlet and i've been playing video games since i was young. as for true crime, it developed from a formative intrigue with serial killers and then it grew from there.\n  ","398096":"\n  no, i disagree with\n  \n   @sweetnothings18\n  \n  's views regarding onlyfans & sex workers in general. i think people (not just women) should have the freedom to do what they want with their bodies, including making money off of pictures and videos and whatnot.\n  \n  i'm also of the understanding, however, that a lot of people in the porn industry and prostitution don't want to be in those industries, so it's a bit different from people who sell photos & videos online. it's still along the lines of sex work, but there's a clear distinction.\n  ","398097":"\n  not any busier than any other time of the year.\n  ","398098":"\n  mental health\/illnesses, true crime, video games, television shows, literature, the arts, alcohol, writing, my career\/education, relationships, etc etc.\n  ","398099":"\n  anyone want to ask me questions while i wait for steam to update? i *was* going to play stardew valley, but my computer has other priorities it seems.\n  ","398100":"\n  i agree with\n  \n   @sweetnothings18\n  \n  -- anywhere between the ages of 18 and 24.\n  ","398101":"\n  several different television shows or movies, chocolate and candy in general, and manicures\/pedicures.\n  ","398102":"\n  i'm not sure if i believe in the concept of \"evil,\" it seems a bit archaic and biblical to me. i believe people have both good and bad in them, it just depends on which side they decide to act upon.\n  ","398103":"\n  this question has been my inbox for a solid month, and i can't think of anything else to say besides the trauma i endured when i was a teenager. it obviously isn't the most glamorous of responses, but it's the only thing i could never forget. i have flashbacks on occasion and get so wrapped up in them that i forget where i am, and even though i'm not in the same environment anymore, the memories still haunt me.\n  ","398104":"\n  thank you ~~\n  \n  i fell back asleep after calling out of work and ended up sleeping for another 2.5 hours or so. then i cooked some breakfast, made a pot of coffee, and i've been on my laptop drinking coffee and listening to relaxing music since then. i might gather up the motivation to play some video games later.\n  ","398105":"\n  i'm honestly not doing so well. i had a terrible night last night, where i was crying for the majority of the night and then i ended up falling asleep and sleeping through all of my alarms this morning.\n  \n  i woke up feeling horrible, so i decided to call out of work and give myself a mental health day. i'm feeling slightly better than i did last night, but i'm still rather down and just trying to distract myself.\n  ","398106":"\n  from my understanding, capitalism mainly only benefits the wealthy.\n  ","398107":"\n  i don't normally watch comedies. but i remember laughing really hard at movies like 21 jump street, get him to the greek, and pineapple express.\n  ","398108":"\n  a quality friend is a person who is there for you when you need them most, especially if you're going through a rough time. they'll check up on you occasionally and listen to you when you're upset while giving productive and supportive feedback.\n  \n  at the same time, a quality friend is also a person who will call you out if you're being hurtful or problematic because they have your best interests in mind.\n  ","398109":"\n  i never have, and i have no interest in it either.\n  ","398110":"\n  i'm content with waking up in my home, as long as i could sleep for as much as i wanted without having the responsibility of going to work, haha.\n  ","398111":"\n  -- heathers\n  \n  -- the crow\n  \n  -- american psycho\n  \n  -- the shining\n  \n  -- the punisher\n  \n  -- django unchained\n  \n  -- the number 23\n  \n  -- girl, interrupted\n  \n  -- the texas chainsaw massacre\n  \n  -- the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring\n  ","398112":"\n  i guess my mental illnesses are both a blessing and a curse. it's a curse because i'm obviously mentally unstable, and i'm prone to episodes of depression and rage, which can lead to me hurting myself. my mood swings are rapid and unpredictable, which is exhausting.\n  \n  however, it's a blessing because it's helped me empathize with other people more who struggle with the same things and i've become an advocate for mental health awareness and reform.\n  ","398113":"\n  i listen to video game instrumental music, like this skyrim ambience one that i'm listening to right now ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9ou1pl0XNRs&t=6278s\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","398114":"\n  i've never been to a festival before, and it isn't something i would be interested in doing in the future. there are too many people, too much noise, and no sense of organization i feel like when it comes to festivals. it would make my society anxiety and sensory overload flare up.\n  ","398115":"\n  yes, i agree with you, especially in terms of the homeless. a lot of homeless people are mentally ill or even veterans who may have PTSD or other mental disorders, but society views them as inferior to those who are more privileged or better off (like having homes, jobs, etc etc).\n  \n  i do think it's disgusting and shameful, and there needs to be more awareness and advocacy on behalf of groups who are more susceptible to mental health problems.\n  ","398116":"\n  being wise is having insight in problems and learning to deal with them accordingly. you may reflect upon past issues and use those lessons learned to approach new problems with a different perspective.\n  \n  to be cunning, on the other hand, means to achieve results through manipulative, toxic, or deceitful ways.\n  ","398117":"\n  somewhere around 35-40 hours, from what i remember.\n  ","398118":"\n  i feel as if we're advancing in terms of the sciences, medicine, and technology. but as a social group in a sociological\/psychological aspect, i don't believe we're advancing -- just remaining stagnant, like you said.\n  ","398119":"\n  i don't think that's controlling, no. that's just you trying to set two friends up together because you think they would be compatible.\n  \n  it *would* be controlling if you insisted upon them getting to know each other if they were resistant to the idea, or if one or both of them weren't looking for a relationship.\n  ","398120":"\n  yeah, i delete some questions that don't necessarily apply to me, that are trolling or hate messages, etc etc.\n  ","398121":"\n  i don't really celebrate easter. sometimes i get together with my family, but i don't look forward to those occasions.\n  ","398122":"\n  i can't, i'm answering questions on my laptop at the moment.\n  ","398123":"\n  no, i don't think i would be able to handle a long distance relationship. i need to see the person i'm dating, spend quality time with them in person, etc etc.\n  \n  long distance relationships work for some people, but certainly not all. i require physical intimacy (no, not just sex) for me to feel loved and comfortable.\n  ","398124":"\n  i actually like my bedroom the way it is now. i have paintings, posters, and tapestries on the walls. i have a cute bedside table, a big desk, and a stand for my television. i have blackout curtains for my window so that i don't wake up early every time the sun rises. i have string lights above my bed. it's overall my sanctuary.\n  ","398125":"\n  no, that isn't the definition of wisdom to me. i believe wisdom is having the ability to learn from past mistakes and utilize the lessons you've learned to apply them to future issues.\n  ","398126":"\n  i like beef jerky, but i never buy it really because it's stupid expensive.\n  ","398127":"\n  depends on how soft the sand is. i like soft sand, but there are some regions of long island where the sand is pretty rocky and it hurts your feet.\n  ","398128":"\n  under \"settings,\" you can turn off photo poll notifications so that they don't pop up on your phone every time a friend makes a poll.\n  ","398129":"\n  taking a few xanax before bed.\n  ","398130":"\n  this view was gorgeous. this was the smoking section of one of the islands in the bahamas.\n  ","398131":"\n  the bahamas.\n  ","398132":"\n  sorta, i swam with sting rays.\n  ","398133":"\n  bob's burgers and big mouth are a few of my favorites. i also got into bojack horseman a while ago too.\n  ","398134":"\n  guilty pleasure, although carbs in moderation are okay. i'm a sucker for pasta and buttered bread, lmaoo.\n  ","398135":"\n  i've never heard of that person before.\n  ","398136":"\n  i need to color my hair again. it got really light after being in the sun and water when i went on vacation.\n  ","398137":"\n  i've been re-watching bones and criminal minds lately.\n  ","398138":"\n  of course. if you don't have trust in your relationship, then that's a serious problem that you need to work on.\n  ","398139":"\n  it depends on the relationship. sometimes they're not growing at the same rate as the other person, or perhaps their priorities don't align anymore. in some cases, it's just a matter of distance and growing apart because interests have changed, or there's a disruption in the chemistry, whether it's emotional or physical.\n  ","398140":"\n  no, i never once indicated that, lol. my weight had nothing to do with our breakup.\n  ","398141":"\n  i think so? i'm not really sure, i don't know what the ingredients are in cannoli cake, lol. i just know it has cannoli cream filling and mini chocolate chips, which is so delicious.\n  ","398142":"\n  yes, she's a bit on the chubbier side.\n  ","398143":"\n  -- i went on vacation two weeks ago for the first time in over 6 years.\n  \n  -- i don't buy gifts for people unless it's a holiday or their birthday.\n  \n  -- drinking every week isn't necessarily expensive, i can buy a 12 rack of beer for $12 and it'll last me a while.\n  ","398144":"\n  i'm not from new york city. regardless, it's an ideal tourist attraction but completely terrible to actually live in.\n  ","398145":"\n  i think you meant to type \"ex boyfriend.\"\n  \n  regardless, we have similar features but obviously we're different.\n  ","398146":"\n  appearances can be deceiving.\n  ","398147":"\n  unfortunately, that isn't my decision to make. in addition, a few of our kind have been kidnapped by earthlings in a desolate location which we believe to be named \"area 51,\" and our priorities are recovering our fellow brethren.\n  ","398148":"\n  LOL. i'll consult the authorities and inform them that we need better disguises prior to our earthly takeover.\n  ","398149":"\n  no, that's just manipulative & ab*sive.\n  ","398150":"\n  quite the opposite, actually. i'm respectful toward others, as long as they return the same sentiment.\n  ","398151":"\n  you caught me -- i'm actually an extraterrestrial in disguise.\n  ","398152":"\n  lol, no. it's just ridiculous and irrational to assume someone would go so far as to m*rder someone over something so insignificant.\n  ","398153":"\n  ... wtf.\n  ","398154":"\n  her and i have never talked about that -- we've only met on a few occasions in social settings. regardless, that isn't a conversation i would have with her because it seems a bit inappropriate.\n  ","398155":"\n  yeah, my face has the tendency to be fairly emotionless, even when i'm upset. it's natural for me to hide my emotions because i don't want to be a burden on anyone else.\n  ","398156":"\n  well, i still love him but i'm also concerned about his own happiness. i'm not wishing for his current relationship to end because that would make him unhappy, but if that does wind up happening, i would probably be willing to give him a second chance under certain conditions.\n  ","398157":"\n  this isn't true -- there are plenty of drugstore makeup products that are high quality and are healthy for you, while there are also higher end makeup products which are lower quality and not necessarily as healthy for you. you're essentially just paying for a brand name that's recognizable.\n  \n  additionally, self respect has nothing to do with the amount of money someone does or does not have. you cannot assume someone has no money or is broke simply because they use drugstore makeup.\n  ","398158":"\n  uh, my ex isn't married. lmaoo.\n  ","398159":"\n  i had an emo phase *and* a scene phase, since i was in middle school and high school in the early 2000s.\n  ","398160":"\n  yes, that is quite rude and pretty classist as well. there's nothing wrong with using drugstore makeup products.\n  ","398161":"\n  i don't answer questions of a sexual nature.\n  ","398162":"\n  yes, that's completely common and normal. when people get older, it's natural to become distant from old friends because we're all our pursuing our own lives separate from who we were when we were younger.\n  ","398163":"\n  why would i be creating a problem? if she had a problem with me, she would have confronted me or him directly.\n  ","398164":"\n  yes, we've hung out on a few occasions.\n  ","398165":"\n  it's fairly rare, but it's completely possible. when a panic attack occurs, people often become very dizzy and lightheaded, so it could potentially lead to someone fainting.\n  \n  i've never fainted myself, but i've definitely felt close to it because of how bad the panic attack was.\n  ","398166":"\n  no, that isn't the reason why we're friends. we're friends because neither of us can imagine a life without the other person in it, and we simply wish to remain friends because we've always had a great friendship, even prior to our relationship. it isn't something either of us want to lose.\n  ","398167":"\n  if i had a dollar for every time someone has said this to me, i would be quite wealthy.\n  ","398168":"\n  before i was on medication, yes. i was terrified to leave the house, and also due to my depression, i did not have the motivation to leave my house either. i wouldn't say that i could have been diagnosed with agoraphobia because i *did* leave the house to go to work, but other than that, i stayed home.\n  ","398169":"\n  no, we're still friends. i value our friendship & i don't know what i would do if we cut ties completely.\n  ","398170":"\n  no, it isn't a habit. it's just a feeling that comes & goes depending on my mood.\n  ","398171":"\n  thank you. :'))\n  ","398172":"\n  i'm not quite sure what you mean by this question. i have habits, but nothing is in relation to my former relationship.\n  ","398173":"\n  they really do, i'm grateful for the few friends i have who have helped me endure this, as well as the support from a few coworkers of mine with whom i'm close.\n  ","398174":"\n  we're still friends, so we talk about the breakup every so often and he always reassures me that nothing was my fault. however, i do still blame myself to some degree when i'm feeling down, because i wonder if there's something i could have done differently to save the relationship.\n  ","398175":"\n  aw, thank you so much. it's obviously been really hard on me, but i've been surviving and basically focusing on work, my friends, and my hobbies.\n  ","398176":"\n  you can't put a time frame on moving on from someone you once dated. everyone has a different method of moving on, and everyone gets over people at different rates. i don't know how long it will take me to move forward, if i even do at all, so i'm just taking each day at a time.\n  ","398177":"\n  the three cups of coffee i had this morning, as well as feeling productive when i finished up my freelance work earlier.\n  ","398178":"\n  of course -- i still love him.\n  ","398179":"\n  it doesn't hurt me, no. i care about his happiness, and while i wish that it was me, i also know that he's doing what's best for himself and that's all that i can ask.\n  ","398180":"\n  no, he's been dating someone.\n  ","398181":"\n  10 years.\n  ","398182":"\n  to a certain degree, yes. however, i've been trying to focus more on the present moment because living in the past and dwelling on the \"what ifs\" is unhealthy.\n  ","398183":"\n  thank you, i really appreciate it.\n  \n  obviously i'm not feeling the best -- but i have both good days and bad, and today i feel relatively stable.\n  ","398184":"\n  yeah, it was partially the reason why i felt comfortable sharing my breakup on askfm.\n  ","398185":"\n  i received this same exact message yesterday.\n  \n  no, you cannot contact me on instagram or any other forms of social media. if you wish to ask me questions, you can do so here on askfm.\n  ","398186":"\n  i'm not really sure what you mean by \"cross the line\"?\n  \n  regardless, there has been no cheating involved. we're respecting each other's boundaries.\n  ","398187":"\n  in a heartbeat, but under certain conditions. he would have to be sure about his feelings towards me and be willing to do this for the long run. i'm sure he's still confused about his feelings at the moment but hasn't spoken to me about them directly, probably because he doesn't want me to get my hopes up and not move on.\n  ","398188":"\n  they're not the same thing, no. there was no sense of intimacy towards the end, and we acted more like friends than anything else because he wasn't in love with me anymore, and honestly he almost felt obligated to be with me because he was afraid of what i would do if he broke up with me. but he couldn't ignore or deny his feelings because he simply wasn't the happiest that he could be with me, and he does deserve to find someone who will make him happy.\n  \n  we're not in a relationship anymore, but we're still friends. just because we're not in a relationship anymore doesn't mean that things haven't changed. everything has changed.\n  ","398189":"\n  i'm not angry at him, no. like i said -- he didn't do anything wrong, he was open about his feelings, and we tried everything we could to fix the situation but he couldn't just ignore how he was feeling.\n  \n  i still love him, and i probably will for a long time. i'm sad more than anything else that things didn't work out, but we're still friends and i'm grateful that he's still in my life because i don't know what i would do without his friendship.\n  ","398190":"\n  that is indeed true, but she made it seem like he did something wrong when he

no, 2020 has been miserable so far. granted, the end of 2019 was also relatively bad considering the breakup, but 2020 has been terrible because i've been sick for half of the past two months and my

the night and going to bed at a reasonable hour so that i can get a full night's rest.\n  ","398233":"\n  i can't envision myself five months from now, let alone five years from now. everything is so up in the air and unexpected.\n  ","398234":"\n  i never thought i would have the opportunity to go on a cruise before. i never thought i would be renting a house with my friends. and i also never thought that i would actually find a job in my field where my writing has been distributed both online and in print.\n  ","398235":"\n  my self-doubt holds me back from being more successful than i

keep secrets of my friends.\n  ","398241":"\n  i would like to believe so, yes. this time last year, i didn't have as much responsibility or leverage at my job, and i've gained two promotions since that time. personally speaking, i don't really remember what i was like one year ago, so i can't really say much to that.\n  ","398242":"\n  it's all right. i only woke up 45 minutes ago, though. i just made a pot of coffee and i've been sitting down and doing some freelance work for my job this morning.\n  ","398243":"\n  the piano is one of my favorite instruments, especially since it's so

soda person, though.\n  ","398262":"\n  i'm sorry you're going through this. you're going to ultimately have to decide what you want to do with the relationship -- either forgive her, or end the

used to love the mario games when i was younger, yes. i don't have any merchandise from the games, but it was essentially a staple of my childhood because i developed an interest in video games at an early age.\n  ","398267":"\n  sushi, veggie burrito bowls, hummus, cheeseburgers, halal food, chicken parm, jerk chicken, picadillo, etc etc.\n  ","398268":"\n  i think a better way to phrase this

of time before there's also an epidemic in other countries.\n  ","398269":"\n  yeah, many times. i'm not the biggest fan of bowling, though.\n  ","398270":"\n  sweatpants and a tank top.\n

i'm mature enough for my age, yes.\n  ","398276":"\n  sometimes i'll reach out and just say hi, i won't tell him i miss him or anything because i don't want to put him in a weird position.\n  \n  other times i'll just distract myself with television, books, and video games.\n  ","398277":"\n  i want another promotion at work and perhaps go camping and more photography excursions, but other than that, no.\n  ","398278":"\n  my close friend.\n  ","398279":"\n  no, he would just say he didn't feel like talking and needed time alone. it would be the same if we were together at times too, we would just sit in silence sometimes but it wasn't that comfortable silence that we used to experience in happier times.\n  ","398280":"\n  both. i didn't know if i was being too clingy, so sometimes i let it go, haha. i didn't want to appear smothering or overbearing.\n  ","398281":"\n  you only see the anons i post. the hate messages get deleted.\n  ","398282":"\n  depends on who i'm around, but generally yes. i only have a close circle of friends and i'm always honest and open with them regarding my feelings and life circumstances. it hurts me more than anything to keep things hidden away within me.\n  ","398283":"\n  yeah, we broke up in september.\n  ","398284":"\n  yes, they're aware of it as well as the fact that he's currently dating someone.\n  ","398285":"\n  somewhat, but not really. like i said, i still love him. that feeling overpowers everything else despite everything.\n  ","398286":"\n  there's a difference between being comfortable and being stagnant. when i say stagnant, i mean that there wasn't much excitement anymore, we didn't go anywhere together anymore, etc etc. even two years back, we were going on vacations and to the park and out to dinner and then it slowly dwindled and stopped, and all we really did was hang out and watch youtube together.\n  ","398287":"\n  of course, we both did. but you cannot control your feelings, and i can't make him love me when his feelings were not there anymore. we had to learn to accept it.\n  ","398288":"\n  no, my mental health prevented it from appearing easy at all. it's been months and i still break down crying every now and again, perhaps 3-4 times per week and especially when i'm listening to music.\n  \n  i just keep thinking about \"what could i have done better?\" or \"what went wrong?\" even though he's reassured me a thousand times that i did nothing wrong and he still values me greatly as a close friend.\n  ","398289":"\n  no, we didn't fight at all actually. there wasn't any conflict between us, we just kinda existed together, if that makes sense. even though i've been progressing in my own personal and professional life, as well as he in his professional life, that doesn't necessarily mean the relationship got stronger.\n  ","398290":"\n  they've been in settings where i was drinking heavily, so ... lmaoo.\n  ","398291":"\n  yes, i'm still very much in love.\n  ","398292":"\n  i'm still in love with him, so no. but i understood that he needed distance and i didn't want to force him to hang out when i knew he needed alone time. like i stated yesterday, the relationship just grew stagnant and it felt like we weren't growing together anymore.\n  ","398293":"\n  probably, lmaoo. i've been very unstable ever since the breakup despite taking my medication every day.\n  ","398294":"\n  i'm happy that he seems happy in his current position, and i'm not jealous of him or her at all. i still care about his happiness, and yes -- i do wish it was still me. but there's no use in feeling jealous because it's a toxic emotion and it will only hurt me.\n  ","398295":"\n  about two months or so, i believe? so it's evident that they were talking, but he didn't cheat on me and i think his feelings developing for her was a catalyst that made him realize he wasn't in love with me anymore.\n  ","398296":"\n  i've hung out with her a few times, yes. she's honestly a hilarious person, and i can relate to her a lot. we struggle with a lot of the same things.\n  ","398297":"\n  we both grew a bit distant from each other and started seeing each other less, and i think that was his way of processing his feelings to know whether or not him falling out of me was actually happening or not.\n  \n  his actual behavior didn't change, but our chemistry did.\n  ","398298":"\n  they've known each other for about a year. and no, it isn't awkward at all -- like i said, my ex and i are still friends and there's no animosity between us at all. we all hang out together on occasion.\n  ","398299":"\n  it was a long time coming, and we finally had an opportunity to sit down and have the time to talk sincerely and deeply about our relationship with no interruptions. it just came up in conversation because we both felt the difference, and it needed to be addressed.\n  \n  obviously i was very upset, but things like this (massive life changes, etc etc.) don't really hit me until days or weeks after the fact, so i was numb to it for a long time.\n  ","398300":"\n  lmfao, to be fair i think everyone is more attractive than me. but yeah, she's pretty and she's our age.\n  ","398301":"\n  no, i have no desire to start dating.\n  ","398302":"\n  the fact that we're not dating anymore? lol.\n  \n  feelings change -- it happens, and people fall out of love or grow out of them after a while. it's an unfortunate part of life, and as unexpected as it was, i can't do anything but accept it for what it is.\n  ","398303":"\n  he already has. like i said, this happened months ago and i've just been not talking about it on social media at all. it isn't a break up that happened recently.\n  ","398304":"\n  work was on my mind most of the day for obvious reasons, but now that i'm home, i'm planning on playing stardew valley for a few hours.\n  ","398305":"\n  i eat muffins occasionally, and blueberry is my favorite.\n  ","398306":"\n  no, i haven't done that. that seems pretty rude, tbh.\n  ","398307":"\n  depends on the man, haha. some men are more attractive with and some are more attractive without, and levels of attraction vary because everyone has a different taste.\n  ","398308":"\n  yes, i don't regret anything about the relationship at all. he's helped me in so many different ways.\n  ","398309":"\n  yeah, we're still friends. we don't see each other very often, but we text nearly every day.\n  ","398310":"\n  i'm not going to lie -- i've come pretty close, and my coping mechanisms haven't exactly been the healthiest, which i'm also ashamed to say. it's just natural for me to hide it, and i do it extremely well ... almost too well.\n  \n  thank you, i appreciate it.\n  ","398311":"\n  i honestly don't know. there's still a large part of me holding out hope, but i know that isn't healthy and i should try to focus on myself instead of a relationship that has already ended.\n  \n  i'm taking each day at a time, focusing my feelings on my friends and career, and spending time delving into my hobbies to make the time pass. at the bottom of my heart, i want things to be different and us to get back together, but that isn't reality right now.\n  ","398312":"\n  he fell out of love with me -- we were stagnant, our relationship wasn't really going anywhere. and as much as he tells me it isn't my fault and i did everything i could, he says that he doesn't think he can love me to the same extent that i love him.\n  \n  i'm not really sure how he feels, despite him saying that. but i do believe it is best for us to spend some time apart, if anything to figure out our feelings because we *were* stagnant for so long. i was just terrified of things ending because of mental illness things, i didn't want to lose him and that's why i kept holding on so desperately.\n  ","398313":"\n  i did, i went with him and his family. we made these plans last spring, way prior to the breakup. everything was already paid for, and we're still on good terms, so i figured it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if i turned down the trip last minute.\n  \n  and regardless of the break up, the cruise was hella fun. it's just bittersweet.\n  ","398314":"\n  yeah, it's weird how things like this have been happening for a lot of people i know, especially my online friends.\n  ","398315":"\n  i'm going to be brutally honest here -- i'm currently in this situation, and it is terrifying. it's heart-wrenching. i've been at the lowest of the lows and it takes so much for me to drag myself out of bed in the morning, knowing what i had is now lost. and i don't know if i can ever get it back.\n  \n  my boyfriend and i broke up, a few months ago. i've been hiding the breakup on askfm because i didn't want to deal with the backlash from anons and the snotty comments, but comments like these and learning of my friends from askfm breaking up with their partners makes me feel more confident to finally say this out loud, outside of my small circle of IRL friends.\n  \n  so, yeah. i understand exactly how you feel. he's still my favorite person. we're still friends. and it hurts more than anything has ever hurt before.\n  ","398316":"\n  neither. i would rather be an anti-hero. someone who does morally questionable things for a greater cause, kind of like a vigilante.\n  ","398317":"\n  i'm not doing well tonight. i'm thinking of having a liquid dinner, tbh.\n  ","398318":"\n  i am not a parent, so i have zero thoughts on the matter.\n  ","398319":"\n  within reason, sure. i'm nice to those who are nice to me, but i'm often cautious of people until i begin to trust them so i'll keep my distance.\n  ","398320":"\n  skin-picking (dermatillomania), that would be the biggest one. it's a terrible habit and my skin is littered with wounds and scars.\n  ","398321":"\n  i eat both fish and meat, so i don't really prefer one over the other. it really depends on my mood that day.\n  ","398322":"\n  my only exceptions would be perhaps meth and heroin, like i've stated earlier (sometime yesterday, i believe). i have too many personal experiences with people overdosing on those drugs, and nothing good can come of legalizing such dangerous drugs, especially considering how cheap they already are anyway.\n  ","398323":"\n  new jersey to the bahamas via a cruise ship (just over 1,000 miles).\n  ","398324":"\n  i don't do anything to maintain my hair. i just wash it, condition it, and put in argan oil after i've washed my hair before it dries.\n  ","398325":"\n  for the most part, i agree with\n  \n   @sweetnothings18\n  \n  . although i do not believe *all* drugs should be legalized, i do agree with her opinion that addiction should be treated as a disease -- which is what addiction actually is.\n  \n  people who are addicts are often thrown in prison for possession, etc etc., and they're not given proper help for their addiction, which only increases the rate of recidivism in the community. addiction is a health care concern, and money should be allocated towards rehabilitative purposes to better treat drug addicts so that they can recover.\n  ","398326":"\n  i care about both, but moreso my physical appearance these days. i've been really unhappy with how i've been looking (which isn't unusual, just more intense now).\n  ","398327":"\n  i've only ever eaten sushi with chopsticks, haha.\n  ","398328":"\n  i prefer using askfm on my computer as opposed to the phone. it's easier to me to type on my laptop than on my phone, especially considering my answers are normally on the longer side.\n  ","398329":"\n  a hot drink -- i'm currently drinking a cup of hot coffee rn, actually. i also don't like physical affection with most people.\n  ","398330":"\n  you would have to ask your partner -- it could mean either thing depending on the individual, and the only way you'll know if they're breaking up with you is if you ask them directly.\n  ","398331":"\n  i was doing fine while i was at work since my mind was being kept busy, but now that i'm home, i'm pretty sad.\n  ","398332":"\n  according to cadence's page, she hasn't posted anything in 22 days. regardless, if\n  \n   @svspicion\n  \n  had an issue with my thoughts, she would simply tell me herself.\n  ","398333":"\n  it's illegal, but that doesn't stop people from doing them. if you're going to choose to do drugs then it's better if you're in a safe environment and do them in moderation.\n  ","398334":"\n  not only happiness and contentment with yourself in general, but also the journey you take to pursue that tranquility and acceptance within yourself.\n  ","398335":"\n  i'm never around elderly people, so i don't have the opportunity to listen to their stories or advice. i don't believe it's something i would be interested in, though.\n  ","398336":"\n  i prefer answering personalized questions about my life, particularly about my job or education, my hobbies, mental health, etc etc. i also like being asked opinion questions, even controversial ones.\n  ","398337":"\n  no, my memory is honestly terrible and it only gets worse as i age.\n  ","398338":"\n  raising awareness of mental health and advocating for mental health reform is one of my top priorities and passions, so it's very important to me.\n  ","398339":"\n  i used to know how to play chess rather well when i was much younger, but i haven't played in many years so i don't think i remember how. :\/\n  ","398340":"\n  i have an anxiety disorder, so basically everything makes me nervous.\n  ","398341":"\n  oh please. if you truly believe i'm going to answer questions of this nature, you evidently don't know me.\n  ","398342":"\n  yeah, i've had acai bowls on occasion in the past. it's pretty delicious.\n  ","398343":"\n  everyone has the freedom to experiment with drugs, as long as they're doing it safely and in moderation. obviously this excludes horribly addictive and lethal drugs such as meth or heroin, though.\n  \n  drugs won't make you get to know yourself, though. most people honestly just use drugs to mask their own feelings for a temporary period of time.\n  ","398344":"\n  i have to go to the bank on friday to take out money for rent. it's a quick, 5-minute thing, but it's just annoying because i hate making stops on my way home from work.\n  ","398345":"\n  i would consider myself to be open-minded, but i also know that there is always more to learn.\n  ","398346":"\n  yes, i have the tendency to be very romantic at times. more than anything, i enjoy having intimate conversations with my partner and spending quality time together.\n  ","398347":"\n  bold of you to assume i use onlyfans.\n  ","398348":"\n  i have the capacity to be quite friendly in situations that warrant it, yes.\n  ","398349":"\n  when someone is fake, they're essentially pretending to be something or someone they are not in order to appease the masses, particularly on social media such as their followers.\n  ","398350":"\n  everyone that i've been interested in over the years have looked completely different, so i've never really had a \"type.\" i also don't place too much emphasis on physical looks, especially since when i'm attracted to someone's personality, their physical looks become even more attractive to me anyway.\n  ","398351":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","398352":"\n  i've been cheated on once (although i do have suspicions that my ex cheated on me too). i've never cheated on anyone before.\n  ","398353":"\n  no, most ASMR videos actually irritate me.\n  ","398354":"\n  \"making a murderer\" on netflix was pretty good if you're into true crime.\n  ","398355":"\n  it's one of the more reliable sources of news, especially in terms of politics, so occasionally i'll visit their website to read up on things.\n  ","398356":"\n  menthol and blue raspberry, considering those are the flavors of the vape juice i smoke every day. lmaoo.\n  \n  but in all seriousness, i honestly have no idea. i wear body spray occasionally, but it changes depending on my mood.\n  ","398357":"\n  i don't believe in karma, so no. regardless, this isn't the first time i've had car issues, haha. it happens every now and again. i've been driving for almost 10 years, after all.\n  ","398358":"\n  most definitely !! there were so many things to do on the cruise ship itself, as well as four-course dinners every night that was included in the cruise price, so it was well worth the money i spent on everything.\n  ","398359":"\n  no, not really. it was a lot of fun, but i wouldn't call it my happy place. the beach is beautiful, but i'm more of a woodsy person.\n  ","398360":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm doing well, although not looking forward to going back to work tomorrow, haha. i'm just about to go to bed considering it's 10:30pm and i need to be up early tomorrow.\n  ","398361":"\n  i don't have patience with children in general.\n  ","398362":"\n  perhaps followers that i'm already friends with, yes.\n  ","398363":"\n  anyone use steam? i just logged back in after not playing for, like ... four years. i'm debating on downloading stardew valley. :'))\n  ","398364":"\n  hm, interesting.\n  ","398365":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, and i seldom ask people questions.\n  ","398366":"\n  nah, i've never played call of duty but i've watched countless other people play the game. i'm not a big fan of online multiplayer games like that, especially considering i'm usually terrible at them.\n  ","398367":"\n  \"where did i go wrong?\"\n  ","398368":"\n  as of last week, the bahamas. i was born and raised in the united states.\n  ","398369":"\n  duality basically means there are two parts of opposites. when i think about music in terms of duality, it can both comfort me and make me inquire about my life. it's an all-encompassing feeling that is also set apart in opposites because music can be so different from song to song, artist to artist, genre to genre.\n  ","398370":"\n  i've actually never seen any star wars movies before. :\/\n  ","398371":"\n  i got my first tattoo a week after i turned 18. it's a yin yang on my back with the two dots for bass clef symbols. for me, it represents the duality of music and how it's a balancing force in my life.\n  ","398372":"\n  yeah, it happened to me the other day. i said something to the extent of \"how have you been?\" and i looked at the word \"been\" and it just ... looked so weird to me after a while. i questioned if i even spelled it right.\n  ","398373":"\n  if you look at a word long enough, any word will seem weird and bizarre to you.\n  ","398374":"\n  nah, i haven't purchased an actual magazine since i was a teenager, lol.\n  ","398375":"\n  apparently, leigh means \"delicate; weary; meadow or pasture.\"\n  \n  i think it does suit me to an extent -- i'm delicate in my emotions, and i do find passion and comfort in nature, such as meadows or pastures.\n  ","398376":"\n  hello. no, i have no intention or desire to vote on your photo poll.\n  ","398377":"\n  eh, this is difficult for me to answer because i have a personality disorder. but i find that certain aspects of being a scorpio (i was born mid-november) resonate with me, especially when it comes to loyalty and being passionate about things in my life.\n  ","398378":"\n  most of the cruise was just cruising in the ocean unfortunately, and i only spent 2 days in the actual bahamas. we visited nassau, bahamas, and spent time at blue lagoon island. then we went to the cruise's private island on the second day. i spent the entire time on the beach, haha.\n  \n  i also had the opportunity to play with stringrays, and that was a lot of fun. :')) the guides taught us about them, how to hold and comfort them, etc etc.\n  ","398379":"\n  i have zero clue, tbh. askfm is for asking & answering questions, nothing more. there are other sites and apps specifically for dating and hookup purposes, haha.\n  ","398380":"\n  ah, i'm sorry you're going through this. :\/ i think it really depends on the person's own personality and what they're into and how they generally handle hardships. i've only been through one bad breakup in my life, but i found that delving into my hobbies helped a lot. i wrote a lot, painted a lot, etc etc. i also listened to a lot of music that helped me identify how i felt.\n  \n  also, having a strong support system like friends or family helps significantly. don't feel guilty to rely on them for the time being.\n  ","398381":"\n  no, he's light skinned. his father is darker than him, but because he's only half cuban (his mother was italian), he has a lighter skin tone.\n  ","398382":"\n  yes, i know quite a few people who don't get nearly enough credit as they should. they're all hard workers who put 110% into everything they do, but they're constantly put down or face hardship despite everything they've worked for.\n  ","398383":"\n  i would like to see more understanding and progress\/reform towards mental health, especially in social and clinical settings.\n  ","398384":"\n  i don't think i believe in life after death, although my beliefs do correspond with some sort of \"life.\" simply put, i believe our souls live on after our physical bodies have perished. i believe that these souls cannot be destroyed because they're composed of energy, and they get transferred to a different medium, whether it's somewhere out in the universe or on our own planet.\n  ","398385":"\n  self-doubt and an inkling of an inability to move on.\n  ","398386":"\n  somewhat, yeah. he's light skinned compared to other cubans.\n  ","398387":"\n  i don't distribute coins to anyone, especially to those who blatantly ask for coins to complete strangers.\n  ","398388":"\n  sliders are delicious !! i normally just eat the regular cheeseburger sliders with just cheese on it (and maybe lettuce and tomato).\n  ","398389":"\n  i'm mostly a homebody, haha. ever since i moved into the new house, i've really enjoyed staying home and taking in the silence. it's comforting to me.\n  \n  however, traveling is also extremely fun and i seldom get to travel, so when i do it's an exhilarating experience. i just came home from an 8-day cruise to the bahamas, which was most definitely an interesting and life-changing experience.\n  ","398390":"\n  i went to an art show a few months ago and purchased a pin from a local artist that says \"femme and fluid.\" i thought it described me fairly well, and i think it would be great to have on a tee shirt.\n  \n  i also like the phrase \"recovery is not linear\" with respect to mental health.\n  ","398391":"\n  probably my laptop. it has all of my work files and resumes, as well as pictures that i've taken over the years.\n  ","398392":"\n  yes, i have a pewter necklace with a tree engraved on it, and on the back it says \"head in the clouds, roots in the earth.\"\n  ","398393":"\n  can we talk about how gorgeous my new desktop background is?\n  ","398394":"\n  not to my knowledge, haha.\n  ","398395":"\n  no, i'm overweight and would like to lose perhaps 60 pounds.\n  ","398396":"\n  she sounds like she's a bit insecure about her own weight -- but obviously i don't know this woman, so i can't say for certain. people's insecurities about their bodies are valid, and instead of reassuring her that \"weight doesn't matter,\" you should politely inquire what about her body she desires to change and then perhaps help her achieve her goals.\n  ","398397":"\n  no, i don't have any children.\n  ","398398":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 28 years old.\n  ","398399":"\n  a little bit, but not much and it turned into a tan within 24 hours. i used a sunscreen with SPF for a change, haha.\n  ","398400":"\n  that's good !! it isn't even something i've ever considered before. i don't even remember the last time i wore a bandaid anyway, lmaoo. i usually just leave the wound open to the air because i heal faster that way (probably isn't the healthiest thing to do, but whatever).\n  ","398401":"\n  LOL, it's all good. i used to be the same way. i enjoy thought-out answers and elaborate thoughts.\n  ","398402":"\n  nah, not really. there are a few songs i enjoy, but overall i don't go out of my way to listen to country music.\n  ","398403":"\n  sitting in the sunshine on a tropical island with a cocktail in my hand is pretty heavenly to me. :'))\n  ","398404":"\n  my ultimate ambition is to help other people struggling with various obstacles, i.e. mental illness, through my own poetry and non-fictional essays. i want to aid in other people's understanding of mental health through my writing.\n  ","398405":"\n  don't compromise yourself for the sake of anyone else's happiness. if your friends, family, and\/or partner truly love and care about you, they wouldn't put you in a position where you would feel the need to lessen yourself or your own happiness just for their own sake.\n  ","398406":"\n  i would pay off all of my debt and put a down payment on a house.\n  ","398407":"\n  take the time to educate yourself on their diagnoses and ask questions. the best way to fully understand your partner's mental health is to become totally invested in their symptoms and behavior, what triggers them and what comforts them, etc etc. there are so many resources online and books to gain a higher understanding of the mechanisms behind most mental illnesses, and it's best to remain as educated as possible.\n  \n  also, always try to be there for them and validate their concerns when needed and as much as you can. an important part of mental health recovery is having a strong support system, and you should be able to provide them with unconditional support (within reason, i.e. unless they're exhibiting problematic behaviors).\n  ","398408":"\n  i have fairly unhealthy coping mechanisms that i've been working on for quite a while, however sometimes i drink alcohol in excess to quell my anger or smoke marijuana.\n  \n  my healthier coping mechanisms include listening to music and venting to friends about what has made me so angry.\n  ","398409":"\n  i'm very much a fan of dark humor, or things that are borderline controversial. i believe that life shouldn't be taken as seriously as it currently is, and it's fine to poke fun at certain things (obviously not everything) if you're in the right position to do so.\n  ","398410":"\n\n   @urlsareshittbh\n  \n\n  his answers are always so magnificently-worded and on point, and he also takes the time to fully elaborate on his opinions and perspectives on the world. i always enjoy reading his answers. :'))\n  ","398411":"\n  i've never considered this notion before, but i do believe that it could be. i rarely ever see anyone practice calligraphy, and i only have one friend (well, she's an acquaintance at this point) who was interested in it.\n  ","398412":"\n  travel to europe and visit such countries as england, ireland, spain, france, italy, etc etc.\n  ","398413":"\n  yes, i believe art can have multiple purposes depending upon the intention of the artist.\n  ","398414":"\n  the power of unconditional love and friendship. the value of communication and trust in all sorts of relationships, both romantic and platonic. the healing powers of music and art. the sense of spirituality and freedom you feel from being immersed in nature.\n  ","398415":"\n  to preface this, i personally wouldn't agree to make a choice between two friends and would likely either remain civil with *both* of them, or cut them both off completely. i think it's incredibly manipulative for a person to force you to choose between them or someone else.\n  \n  however, for the sake of answering the question, i think i would weigh the pros and cons of each person's personality and who i connect with better, have better times together, and in general who serves me better in my own pursuit of happiness. i would look to see if either of them have any problematic viewpoints or behaviors that would lead to betrayal or sadness in the long run, and then go from there. in all honesty, you shouldn't be friends with a person whose presence doesn't fulfill you.\n  ","398416":"\n  your opinion is irrelevant to this conversation.\n  ","398417":"\n  if you knew me at all, you would know that i don't answer questions of this nature.\n  ","398418":"\n  \"if you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n  ","398419":"\n  -- seeing loved ones laugh or smile.\n  \n  -- forests with expansive greenery and tall trees.\n  \n  -- the beach with rolling waves at sunset.\n  \n  -- classical music, particularly piano and violin pieces.\n  \n  -- art in general, especially mixed media works and oil paintings.\n  ","398420":"\n  \"you\" and \"hidden bodies\" by caroline kepnes.\n  \n  i started reading \"you\" on the cruise and got about halfway through it, and it's really intense. it's actually a bit different and better than the television show (the one on netflix). you get real insight into each character because the descriptions take their time instead of being rushed, and even though i know what happens at the end of the story, i'm still enjoying it.\n  ","398421":"\n  the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring.\n  \n  it's honestly just a fantastic film, and one of my all-time favorites. the acting, scenery, special effects, and range of emotions are superb and you automatically get sucked into the storyline.\n  ","398422":"\n  i'm mostly a clean\/organized person unless i'm going through a depressive episode.\n  ","398423":"\n  yes, i believe there is some good in everyone -- but also some bad as well. it entirely depends upon which side of yourself you act upon.\n  ","398424":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, actually. it would ideally be pleasant to have no more hardship in life -- but at the same time, hardship and obstacles are what make us stronger and more versatile, wiser even. we learn from our hardships and mistakes even though they may hurt us or other people, and it makes us more well-rounded.\n  ","398425":"\n  without a doubt, yes. i would absolutely be willing to relocate to a distant location with my loved one, even if it meant not seeing my friends or family often at all. i'm not close with my family by any means, anyway, and i know i can always make new friends.\n  ","398426":"\n  for the most part, yes. i have a few friendships that i've been questionable about lately because they do not bring out the best in me, and we're sorta bad influences on each other -- especially in terms of drinking and making bad decisions, haha. they're a great friend and i'm also very attached to them, which makes the situation harder for me to process.\n  ","398427":"\n  music, most definitely. music has always been one of my greatest passions, and i try to listen to it as much as possible, whether it's an instrumental song\/classical music, hip hop, indie, alternative rock, etc etc.\n  ","398428":"\n  yeah, that has happened to me on multiple occasions, lol. sometimes i sleep with my arm under my pillow as my head rests on the pillow, and i'll wake up in the middle of the night with my arm completely numb.\n  \n  i also get stiff necks sometimes when i sleep the wrong way, but that usually only happens when i get little sleep.\n  ","398429":"\n  i actually went on a ferry last week to go from the cruise ship's dock to one of the islands in the bahamas. it was an interesting experience, and i didn't feel as sea-sick as i thought i would. i was on the top deck so i got to see the entire ocean and scenery as it passed us by.\n  ","398430":"\n  tbh, i'm a white person and i feel like this question would be better answered by someone who's a person of color. as a white person (and a very pale white person, at that), i've always used either the beige bandaids or translucent band aids and never thought twice about the color.\n  ","398431":"\n  i liked the show \"friends\" when i was much younger, but after re-watching it within the past year or so, i didn't really find it to be spectacular or funny really. it was majorly hyped up during its time, which makes sense because it kinda pushed the boundaries in that time period (i think it debuted in the 1990s?).\n  \n  i'm apathetic towards the reunion episode, i have no intentions of watching it because i simply don't care. i don't really think it will ruin the original series because i've heard that it isn't going to be a \"real\" episode, just a sit-down with the actors\/actresses as they reflect upon the series.\n  ","398432":"\n  the person i admire the most has faced so much adversity in their life, but they've still managed to come out stronger in the end and utilized their experiences as a stepping stone toward the success they're garnered today. they've also been humbled by their past experiences and obstacles, and it has equipped them with better knowledge and understanding of how the world works.\n  ","398433":"\n  in a general sense, no. i don't believe so. social media simply allows people the opportunity to exhibit their rude\/callous behaviors, particularly when it comes to anonymous question-asking sites like askfm or curiouscat. people like to hide behind anonymous identities and show their true colors because they're too ashamed to show that side of them in public.\n  ","398434":"\n  i'm basically an open book for the most part, but i do keep some things to myself unless asked in a respectful manner. i like sharing my experiences with others (especially with respect to mental health) in order to help them understand their own emotions and behavior.\n  ","398435":"\n  yes, for most of my life i've done certain things knowing that they weren't the right decision to make. things such as stealing, hurting other people intentionally, etc etc.\n  ","398436":"\n  haha, yeah -- i got a decent tan !! i was out in the caribbean sun for about 4-5 hours for two days straight.\n  ","398437":"\n  honestly, a lot of the people seemed really snooty, and it was mostly families with children since a lot of schools had last week off for winter break. i didn't make any friends, which i'm perfectly fine with. it wasn't my intention anyway.\n  ","398438":"\n  no, we took a cruise ship from new jersey all the way down to the bahamas.\n  ","398439":"\n  thank you !!\n  \n  it was so much fun & so relaxing -- it was an 8-day cruise to the bahamas, so i spent one day in florida and then two days in the bahamas. the ship was huge and beautiful with so many shops and bars (lol), and there was also a casino so that was interesting too.\n  \n  here's a photo of the edge of one of the islands we went to as we rode in through the ferry.\n  ","398440":"\n  my ability to empathize with other people through the written word.\n  ","398441":"\n  i offer them my time and shoulder to cry on, for them to have a space to vent and receive feedback if they want it. i mainly try to be a source of comfort and consolation for them so that they don't feel alone in their thoughts. i want them to know that they aren't struggling in isolation.\n  ","398442":"\n  last week, i visited the kennedy space center in florida, which was *very* interesting & a lot of fun !! i saw shuttles and other space equipment used in the early apollo missions, and then the tour guide drove us to a different part of the center where we could see the former launch sites.\n  ","398443":"\n  my roommate bought lunch for us earlier today, so i bought him two puff bars from the vape shop in return, lol.\n  ","398444":"\n  i forgot to bring a physical copy of my resume to a job interview right after i had graduated from college, and the boss wouldn't even start the interview and sent me out after 30 seconds of talking. i cried the entire drive home.\n  \n  i should note that the company already had my resume on file (i had e-mailed it to them the day prior) so i was pretty upset, both at the company as well as at myself.\n  ","398445":"\n  i don't carry one with me, but i have one at home and one at work. my home bottle is just a giant purple insulated thermos, while my work bottle is a gray cold thermos with the hogwarts crest on it.\n  ","398446":"\n  yes, it was with his family.\n  ","398447":"\n  yes, it was terrific !! i didn't really have any expectations, though. i've never been on a cruise or left the country before, so it was all new to me.\n  ","398448":"\n  returned home from vacation, went to the diner and vape shop, unpacked all of my clothing and belongings, and watched some television.\n  ","398449":"\n  yes, i've had people steal my identity before. it was an absolute nightmare and i'm sorry you have to go through it as well.\n  ","398450":"\n  depends on the situation and context. some hate is better off ignored, while other forms of hate should be addressed.\n  \n  personally speaking, when it comes to online hate (like on askfm), i just ignore it most of the time. it isn't worth getting riled up over a stranger's opinion on your life, and it also isn't worth giving that person the privilege of seeing you get upset over their comments.\n  ","398451":"\n  sunsets. ?\n  ","398452":"\n  cheetos, lmaoo.\n  ","398453":"\n  i used to be a night person, but now i'm definitely more of a day person (thanks to my 9-5 job). i don't stay up late like i used to anymore, and i feel much more productive and happy when i wake up early and get things done during the day.\n  ","398454":"\n  no, there's no use in being afraid to voice your own opinion. by making your opinions known, you'll garner a more authentic group of friends\/relationships, because then you're not basing your inner circle on something you don't necessarily believe in.\n  \n  i've always been pretty open with my opinions.\n  ","398455":"\n  i tried escargot for the first time last week !! they were in some sort of olive oil and pesto sauce as an appetizer.\n  ","398456":"\n  i prefer to be behind the camera, most definitely. i'm only occasionally comfortable with selfies if i'm feeling okay that day, and i would rather take photos of scenery and nature than see photos of myself.\n  ","398457":"\n  i didn't do anything for valentine's day because i was at work and then packing for my vacation.\n  ","398458":"\n  i don't like turn-based games, even though i've tried some in the past.\n  ","398459":"\n  i like walking around various parks and nature preserves, but i seldom go these days (especially now considering it's winter). there are quite a few beautiful parks on long island.\n  ","398460":"\n  i have a youtube account, but i don't post videos or comments. i only use it to watch videos and have other videos recommended to me based on what i've already watched.\n  ","398461":"\n  i have an account on medium, but i wouldn't consider it to be a blog because it's mostly a compilation of personal essays i've written over the years.\n  ","398462":"\n  i have the most followers on askfm, actually. lmaoo.\n  \n  i've had this account for two years, i think, and a lot of my followers migrated from my older accounts since i've been using askfm since around 2011 or so. i'm not sure why so many people follow me but i can only assume it's because they find my answers interesting or entertaining.\n  ","398463":"\n  i'll speak on behalf of last week, considering today is sunday. but the happiest moment of last week was sitting on the beach in the bahamas with a cold drink in my hand and the sun shining down on me with the smell of ocean all around.\n  ","398464":"\n  none of my pullovers have holes in them, but i do have a few really old (like 10+ years old) hoodies that i can't bear to throw away.\n  ","398465":"\n  not very often because a lot of my concerns are recognized as irrational, but quite a few really horrible fears of mine have come true. :\/\n  ","398466":"\n  mondays are usually the busiest day of the week for me, because i normally have to catch up on emails from over the weekend when i'm at work, as well as set up weekly routines and whatnot. i find that i'm most productive at work on mondays -- i guess because i feel recharged from being off during the weekend, lol.\n  ","398467":"\n  i seldom block people on social media with the exception of a few family members whom i feel uncomfortable knowing my business.\n  ","398468":"\n  i don't buy new clothing often at all, but occasionally i'll splurge if i really see something i like. i normally wear the same clothes for years, lol.\n  ","398469":"\n  i'm not sure what i'm having for dinner tonight, let alone tomorrow night, lol.\n  ","398470":"\n  it's a difficult situation to be in -- not every situation like that is going to be the same. in some cases, it may help if you do tell your ex that you still have feelings for them, but only if you think there's a chance things could be different going forward.\n  \n  if your ex is clearly happy with their life and\/or in a new relationship, then it's better for both of you if you simply tried to move on. you deserve to be happy as well, and hindering yourself by remaining in love with an ex who doesn't reciprocate those feelings only hurts you.\n  ","398471":"\n  hairbrush, toothbrush and toothpaste, deodorant, body spray, vape pen, car, internet, etc etc.\n  ","398472":"\n  i went to the vape store and purchased a new vape pen because my original vape pen died on me during my vacation. :\/\n  ","398473":"\n  i have dimples if i'm genuinely happy & smiling big enough.\n  ","398474":"\n  i'd love to adopt a dog and a few reptiles, like a bearded dragon or a chameleon.\n  ","398475":"\n  my roommate and i went to the diner earlier this morning, and i ordered a spinach omelette.\n  ","398476":"\n  people can absolutely befriend and remain friends with those of other sexes and genders, and it isn't inevitable that feelings would develop between them. platonic relationships are extremely common between people of different sexes and genders, and i personally have several friends who aren't of the same sex or gender as me.\n  ","398477":"\n  it would depend on the context of their relationship and current friendship. if my partner's ex still had feelings for them, then i'm not sure that i would be comfortable with the idea of them being friends still because it isn't giving the ex a chance to move on (or it might give them hope that my partner would break up with me in favor of them).\n  \n  in most other circumstances, though, i see nothing wrong with exes being friends with each other.\n  ","398478":"\n  it doesn't work for me most of the time when i've tried using it, but it depends on my mood that day. some days i'm more comfortable than others, so i'll be more apt to consider video responses on good days.\n  ","398479":"\n  i have the samsung galaxy s10 right now, and it has the best camera of all of the previous phones i've had.\n  \n  the quality is very high resolution and i like how the camera recognizes the setting and adjusts for the photo accordingly (like for sunsets, for example).\n  ","398480":"\n  i write magazine articles, press releases, and online content for my job. i also write creatively as well, usually in the form of personal essays and poetry.\n  ","398481":"\n  yeah, i like some sour things. i don't usually eat candy, but warheads used to be my favorite.\n  ","398482":"\n  this was last night's sunset on the cruise ship. :'))\n  ","398483":"\n  i don't play any sports.\n  ","398484":"\n  i don't usually go to caf\u00e9s, but there is a local coffee shop that i've visited with friends a few times.\n  ","398485":"\n  i eat steak occasionally, and i order it medium rare.\n  ","398486":"\n  yes, i wear glasses every day.\n  ","398487":"\n  it can be either-or. sometimes, i crave solitude and will shut myself off from everyone. other times, i'll be craving social interaction and text my friends incessantly, talk to my roommates, make plans to go out, etc etc.\n  ","398488":"\n  no, lol. her sister has a husband. sorry, family relationships are often confusing.\n  ","398489":"\n  yes, i find painting to be very relaxing. i haven't painted anything in a long time, though.\n  ","398490":"\n  i have to be in the mood for them, which most of the time i'm not. when i get home from work, my brain is essentially shot and i don't have the energy to do deep-thinking exercises.\n  ","398491":"\n  i don't drink monster anymore -- i used to drink the energy tea (i think it might have been raspberry or something?), but it didn't give me any energy at all.\n  ","398492":"\n  i'm obsessed with spinach. lmaoo.\n  ","398493":"\n  yes, i love broccoli. it's one of my favorite vegetables.\n  ","398494":"\n  productive.\n  ","398495":"\n  absolutely disgusting. it's a transphobic slur and shouldn't be used. trans women are still women.\n  ","398496":"\n  i had general tso's chicken and thai spring rolls from the chinese food place.\n  ","398497":"\n  i like plain strawberries on occasion. however, when i do crave something sweet, dark chocolate-covered strawberries are delicious.\n  ","398498":"\n  haha, no the coronavirus is extremely rare and basically only happening in wuhan, china right now. i got diagnosed with strep throat on sunday, so i've been recovering from that. then i developed a head cold, smh.\n  \n  i've been watching netflix and drinking water since i've had an insatiable thirst since i got sick. this is the most water i've drank perhaps in my entire life, lmaoo.\n  ","398499":"\n  i've wanted to try it out, but haven't really felt the overwhelming urge to. if anything, i've been trying to avoid processed foods and eat more home-cooked meals.\n  \n  (with the exception of tonight. lmaoo.)\n  ","398500":"\n  thank you !! i'm glad too, i was feeling horrible between saturday night and yesterday. i still woke up with the sweats this morning, but i haven't ran a fever all day and i'm not as in pain or as congested as i previously was.\n  ","398501":"\n  yes, this happens to me all the time. when i'm verbally speaking, i constantly blank out and lose track of the words i'm saying and some words don't even come to mind.\n  ","398502":"\n  the only things i've watched out of that list is the movie \"the notebook\" and the show \"you.\" i don't even know who noah centineo is, lol.\n  ","398503":"\n  after getting over being sick, tonight i washed all of my sheets, comforters, blankets, etc etc., to get the sickness out. i'm excited to actually fall asleep without a fever and sleep in clean, sanitized sheets.\n  ","398504":"\n  airplane window photo flying from texas to new york at sunrise.\n

else.\n  ","398506":"\n  general tso's spicy chicken. which is appropriate, considering i just ordered chinese food for delivery not too long ago. lmaoo.\n  ","398507":"\n  i've never owned an iphone, so i honestly have zero clue. you're better off asking someone who uses apple products.\n  ","398508":"\n  i honestly don't remember when it was or what it was about. we seldom argue.\n  ","398509":"\n  no, i'm not quite sure how you can successfully wear a shirt upside down.\n  ","398510":"\n  my day has been fine. i'm still sick, but after tonight i won't be contagious anymore so i can go back to work tomorrow morning.\n  ","398511":"\n  ugh, myself. :\/\n  \n  i pick at my skin compulsively, and i really wanted to try to clear up my skin before my trip since i'll be wearing short sleeves & bathing suits and stuff. but i've been so bad the past two days, it's going to look horrible.\n  ","398512":"\n  i'd rather not have internet access, haha. i work on a computer at a desk, and i can't imagine standing & working the entire time. also ... standing & driving would be hella weird.\n  ","398513":"\n  yes !! i'm leaving to go on a cruise to the bahamas this saturday. :'))\n  ","398514":"\n  i love art, especially surrealism (whether it's painting or digital or photography). i'm also an avid fan of writing & literature, as well as music.\n  \n  i haven't drawn

psychology behind it all to be intriguing.\n  ","398519":"\n  i engage in writing, photography (sometimes), and drawing\/painting. i consider them to be an outlet for my emotions, when it comes to writing at least, but also an urge to create something, which is evident in my recent drawings.\n  \n  i've already developed my interest in writing into an occupation, for which i'm quite thankful. i'm currently a writer\/editor for a publishing company, and i do freelance writing on the side.\n  ","398520":"\n  no, i rarely get offended. not much bothers me these days because everything seems rather insignificant.\n  ","398521":"\n  i'm *very* open emotionally, to trusted people at the very least. i'm open with my boyfriend and close friends, and i openly express my worries and insecurities and concerns because i need the validation that i'm doing the right thing.\n  ","398522":"\n  they very seldom have family gatherings because the family is literally spread out across the entire country, lol. most of them are actually in florida, but they seldom travel to new york.\n  \n  these days, the family gatherings consist of just my boyfriend, his father, his father's girlfriend and her two daughters, and his father's girlfriend's family (a sister, her husband, and two daughters). it isn't really *that* many people, but it's still a significant amount.\n  ","398523":"\n  i usually just ignore it, but it does get on my nerves sometimes.\n  ","398524":"\n  idk, i guess wendy's? their spicy nuggets and crispy chicken sandwiches are pretty tasty.\n  ","398525":"\n  i don't agree with the death penalty, so i disagree with this notion. however, i do believe that drunk drivers whose actions result in fatalities should get life in prison.\n  ","398526":"\n  i dislike shopping a lot, especially in crowded places like the grocery store or the mall. i can only be out for perhaps an hour maximum before i get overwhelmed. it takes a lot out of me.\n  ","398527":"\n  01. i'm obsessed with true crime documentaries & shows about serial killers.\n  \n  02. i have a degree in professional writing with a minor in english literature.\n  \n  03. my current occupation is a writer\/editor for a publishing company.\n  \n  04. i don't like regular water -- i only drink flavored seltzer water.\n  \n  05. my favorite video games are skyrim, the fallout series, the bioshock series, and the assassin's creed series.\n  \n  06. i quit smoking cigarettes last september after smoking a pack a day for 10 years.\n  \n  07. i prefer beer over wine, and wine over liquor.\n  \n  08. i'm diagnosed with several mental illnesses and prescribed multiple psychiatric medications.\n  \n  09. i've been in a relationship since 2009.\n  \n  10. i currently live with two roommates and two cats.\n  ","398528":"\n  confide in my boyfriend and\/or close friends about what had happened to me.\n  ","398529":"\n  idk, probably something similar to what i'm doing now with more of a focus on creative writing. perhaps a freelance novelist or poet.\n  ","398530":"\n  i've just never been interested in sports.\n  ","398531":"\n  household chores, particularly cleaning or doing laundry. also, driving. i have nearly an hour commute to and from work each day.\n  ","398532":"\n  yesterday, i was playing skyrim for most of the afternoon.\n  ","398533":"\n  definitely not, considering i was a smoker for around 10 years. smoking is extremely harmful to the body and there are literally zero benefits to smoking.\n  ","398534":"\n  yes, i am currently in love.\n  ","398535":"\n  thanks for the follow ~~\n  ","398536":"\n  i don't believe it was rude at all -- you obviously don't know him, lol. it most definitely needed to be addressed because it was a lot of weight in such a short span of time, and he was concerned for my health.\n  \n  i don't even remember how he said it, it happened two or more years ago.\n  ","398537":"\n  no, i knew it wasn't in a negative way and he was just bringing it up because it needed to be addressed. the weight gain was so quick that he was concerned for my health and wasn't quite sure what had happened. obviously he doesn't care if i'm fat or skinny, i'm still me, but i wasn't hurt by it because i had also noticed it too.\n  ","398538":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","398539":"\n  i don't like watching or playing any sports.\n  ","398540":"\n  i don't follow people on request.\n  ","398541":"\n  i don't follow people on request, sorry.\n  ","398542":"\n  he expressed concern when i first initially started gaining weight as a result of my inactivity\/medication, but it wasn't in a negative tone. he was more worried than anything else.\n  ","398543":"\n  coffee, true crime documentaries, serial killers, mental health awareness, art, writing, and animals.\n  ","398544":"\n  i think & read in a distinct voice, but i've never been certain of whose voice is it -- i don't recognize it as my own, but i also don't recognize it as anyone else's either.\n  \n  i also read and think with the words appearing as images in the forefront of my mind, like i can visualize what i'm thinking and often i fixate on certain words.\n  ","398545":"\n  depends, it's constantly changing. right now, i'm pretty neutral -- not happy, but not sad either.\n  ","398546":"\n  yes, i 100% agree !!\n  ","398547":"\n  i believe that a combination of healthy eating & routine exercise is much better and healthier for losing weight than following a \"fad\" diet, like the keto diet for example.\n  \n  the keto diet certainly works to a certain degree, but it's a lifestyle change and people who stop doing keto end up gaining their weight back most of the time. it isn't long term.\n  ","398548":"\n  i would suggest that they focus more on obtaining more sleep instead of exercising. they're going to wear themselves out completely and get sick.\n  ","398549":"\n  it's around 40 degrees fahrenheit and it's raining.\n  ","398550":"\n\n   @NineGDxFour\n  \n  and i don't talk often, but i wouldn't be opposed to meeting her !!\n  ","398551":"\n  you can easily google this information like i just did, lol.\n  ","398552":"\n  you're going to have to be more specific. what exactly would you like me to describe?\n  ","398553":"\n  my boyfriend used to be really messy, but that's gotten a lot better as he's gotten older. other than that, he doesn't really have any annoying habits other than things like sucking on his teeth when he's stressed, lmaoo.\n  \n  if you're worried about things amplifying when you move in together, is there a way for you to talk to him about it all?\n  ","398554":"\n  definitely, there are quite a few people whom i'd love to meet. i'm closest to\n  \n   @littlesha_\n  \n  ,\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  ,\n  \n   @CelineM96\n  \n  , and\n  \n   @misphire\n  \n  .\n  ","398555":"\n  yes, i've heard of the term before & know what it is.\n  ","398556":"\n  no, i'm not interested in that at all.\n  ","398557":"\n  i love tattoos & i think they're a terrific means of self expression and form of art.\n  ","398558":"\n  in bed, unsuccessfully trying to take a nap.\n  ","398559":"\n  ???\n  \n  i'm definitely not famous & all i did was answer a question. lmaoo calm down.\n  ","398560":"\n  sarcastic with a hint of dark\/morbid.\n  ","398561":"\n  mine has been fairly active. i also have a lot of leftover questions in my inbox, so i've been answering those occasionally.\n  ","398562":"\n  i honestly would have no clue unless the situation presented itself. i don't have children and i can't fathom the idea of even having kids.\n  ","398563":"\n  depends on whether or not it's actually plausible. most vacations are paid for x amount of days ahead of time, so there's no possible way to change that. i would explain that to the child and tell them we'll go on another vacation soon.\n  ","398564":"\n  i think three days can be sufficient depending on the individual. then again, i work nearly every day of the week so any time off is beautiful to me, lmaoo.\n  ","398565":"\n  i have around 40 questions in my inbox. which ones were yours?\n  ","398566":"\n  LOL. you literally brought this upon yourself by questioning logic when all i said was that i wanted to see a movie.\n  \n  have a nice day, anon ~~\n  ","398567":"\n  uh ... you were the one who brought up the subject of logic? it's just a movie, dude.\n  ","398568":"\n  i'm not being defensive (and my intent isn't to appear defensive either). it's just silly to look into this so deeply when it means nothing.\n  ","398569":"\n  okay? just because i don't care about the oscars doesn't mean that i can't be interested in seeing a movie that's supposed to be really good, lol.\n  ","398570":"\n  cold hands, since my hands are always cold anyway.\n  ","398571":"\n  no, i haven't visited a library since high school.\n  ","398572":"\n  i don't. i didn't watch them, but i saw on twitter that parasite won a lot of awards so that made me interested in seeing the movie.\n  ","398573":"\n  i'm paying for myself, lol.\n  ","398574":"\n  abortion is a health care concern and anyone should be able to obtain an abortion regardless of the reason behind it.\n  ","398575":"\n  we've been together for around 10 years. i'm not really focused on marriage, it isn't a priority for us.\n  ","398576":"\n  my boyfriend and his family.\n  ","398577":"\n  we started planning it last spring. it was originally my boyfriend's father's idea (and his girlfriend) and we all agreed that it would be a once in a lifetime trip.\n  ","398578":"\n  i saw that it won a lot of awards last night, so now i'm curious !!\n  ","398579":"\n  depends on the day & whether or not i'm going out to see people.\n  ","398580":"\n  well, my week is definitely far from energetic, but i appreciate the message. :'))\n  ","398581":"\n  it means that you're out about being gay instead of closeted.\n  ","398582":"\n  going to the pharmacy to pick up antibiotics so that i can start to feel better.\n  ","398583":"\n  joker & parasite.\n  ","398584":"\n  who said i was rich? lol.\n  \n  god forbid i take a vacation for the first time in over five years. granted, i had to do some magic tricks with my money and work overtime, but nevertheless i deserve to go on vacation.\n  ","398585":"\n  i enjoyed them a lot, and i found the stories to be very compelling. obviously there's some dramatization to the stories, but i'm more focused on the actual story than whether or not it's entirely true.\n  ","398586":"\n  i used to watch those a lot, but haven't in a while !! they weren't so much documentaries, but i used to watch shows like paranormal lockdown, ghost brothers, ghost hunters, ghost adventures, etc etc.\n  ","398587":"\n  i don't usually eat cheeseburgers, but when i do, i just order a regular burger with cheese, lettuce, and tomato.\n  ","398588":"\n  i already know who my real friends are. i don't need to cease contact with anyone to verify that.\n  ","398589":"\n  no, i wouldn't do that at this point in my life. that would mean no contact with my boyfriend or close friends, and that would be upsetting.\n  ","398590":"\n  i'm pretty sure that's standard protocol? depending on how much they've stolen, i.e. a significant sum of money from the lockbox or cash register.\n  ","398591":"\n  yes, i think minimum wage in general should be $15\/hour and all other jobs will be increased as well. the cost of living is too high for the current minimum wage, it isn't considered a liveable wage anymore.\n  ","398592":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","398593":"\n  possibly. i'm still debating on it, because i know i won't be checking my account during my vacation. getting all of the notifications will be aggravating, unless i simply turn off notifications on my phone.\n  ","398594":"\n  i've never seen any of the lego movies (or even played any of the lego games based on movies, haha).\n  ","398595":"\n  if you're friends with a coworker, then i believe that you need to compartmentalize your feelings of friendship with the relationship you have with them as an employee. you shouldn't discriminate against other employees to whom you do not have a personal relationship, and you need to separate your personal feelings from your professional feelings.\n  ","398596":"\n  neither. i'm a realist above all else. i weigh the pros and cons of various situations and understand that every situation has different sides to it.\n  ","398597":"\n  i don't know much about either character. i've never really been interested in marvel or DC.\n  ","398598":"\n  i'm not sure i understand the question. my dynamics with my friends are different from my dynamics with coworkers, and if an employee was doing something wrong, i would have simply pulled them aside, explained what they were doing wrong, and teach them to do it right instead. if they were still being lazy or insubordinate or whatever, then i would refer the situation to a higher authority.\n  ","398599":"\n  i don't smoke cigarettes anymore. i vape occasionally, though.\n  ","398600":"\n  my boyfriend's family got some sort of group deal (perhaps groupon?) on the trip, so it wasn't very expensive, considering it's an 8-day cruise. i'm going with my boyfriend and his family.\n  ","398601":"\n  both, but i suspect that a lot (if not most) humans are fueled by greed.\n  ","398602":"\n  i'm going to the bahamas.\n  ","398603":"\n  it's somewhere different than i've ever been before, and i think it would be interesting to experience a culture that i've not been acquainted with. one of my closest friends from my teenage years is chinese, and she went to hong kong a few years ago to visit family. she said it was a really fun trip.\n  ","398604":"\n  i'm not going to hong kong, lmaoo. the question asked where i would go if i had to choose a 14-hour flight somewhere.\n  ","398605":"\n  i wouldn't risk it even at that, there's an abundance of sickness going around the office and my immune system is already low right now, so i could easily catch something else.\n  \n  unfortunately, my time off is unpaid right now because i used up my PTO for the month to take a day off from work after my vacation. i used up all of my vacation time for my vacation next week.\n  ","398606":"\n  that i'm a strong, capable, and compassionate person despite all that i've gone through during my life. i don't give myself enough credit where credit is due, and i'm constantly criticizing myself or trying to overcompensate when it isn't needed at all.\n  ","398607":"\n  much better than yesterday, thank goodness. i took two doses of antibiotics so far, and the doctor at the clinic last night also gave me some steroids for the inflammation, so i was able to sleep well. i haven't had a fever since last night either, and i feel functional today. if i wasn't really contagious, i would have gone to work, lol.\n  ","398608":"\n  physically, the hardest and most painful thing i've ever had to do (well, not *had* to, but wanted to, lol) was get my ribcage tattooed. by far the worst pain i've ever been in.\n  ","398609":"\n  nature, mainly. i love forests, beaches, sunsets, waterfalls, and mountains.\n  ","398610":"\n  you can't really generalize people in such a broad sphere like this because everyone has different motives in their lives. some people value money, while others value love, while there are even some people who value both equally.\n  ","398611":"\n  depends on the child -- some children are more responsible than others, and while some kids may need their homework checked, there are also others whose homework doesn't necessarily need to be checked because the parents already know that they've finished it.\n  ","398612":"\n  personally, i don't think having a friends-only option would benefit me because most of the questions i receive are anonymous, and i prefer the public platform. i often have anonymous people come to me for advice and whatnot, and they prefer their identity to be unknown for privacy's sake.\n  ","398613":"\n  my boyfriend and i would probably fly to hong kong, since that's one of the few flights that are 14 hours long coming out of new york.\n  ","398614":"\n  the fourth edition of my job's magazine was completed for online production last week, which is the collaborative efforts of myself alongside a graphic designer and a print production manager. nearly everything in the magazine was written, proofread, and cross-examined by me, and i accompanied the magazine with an editor's letter, which introduced readers to what they're about to read.\n  \n  my supervisor read my letter and said it was \"superb,\" which made me feel really good about myself. :'))\n  ","398615":"\n  when it comes to creative writing, i seem to derive inspiration from the events that are currently going on in my life, whether it's heartache or a sense of accomplishment or negative thoughts stemming from poor mental health. i've always seemed to write more eloquently when i'm not in a healthy frame of mind, for whatever reason, but it's very cathartic to let those emotions out in a constructive manner.\n  ","398616":"\n  i've always wanted to travel cross-country and visit the redwoods national park and the grand canyon, both in the united states. i would also like to see the badlands and yosemite national park.\n  ","398617":"\n  dragons, most definitely. i've been obsessed with dragons since i was young.\n  ","398618":"\n  i respect my boyfriend and a few close friends the most, as well as one or two coworkers and my supervisor. it takes a lot to earn my respect, but once someone does earn it, i'm forever loyal to them.\n  ","398619":"\n  -- listening to relaxing music in the mornings.\n  \n  -- having the first cup of coffee of the day.\n  \n  -- hearing my boyfriend and close friends laugh hysterically.\n  \n  -- writing something creative and being proud of it.\n  \n  -- grabbing food and drinks with people i love.\n  \n  -- taking walks in nature preserves and on the beach.\n  \n  -- playing video games, especially skyrim or the fallout series.\n  \n  -- watching true crime documentaries & essentially learning new things about forensics and criminal psychology.\n  ","398620":"\n  -- beginning to self-harm. i wouldn't have started in the first place.\n  \n  -- dating my ex-boyfriend. it was a really toxic and unhealthy relationship.\n  \n  -- beginning to smoke cigarettes. it turned into a 10-year addiction that likely worsened my health greatly and compromised my immune system.\n  ","398621":"\n  neither, to a certain degree. when you truly love someone in a healthy manner, you push them and motivate them to remain consistent with their natural selves but to also improve upon their natural selves. you're not changing them, but you're seeking to watch them gain the confidence to be the best version of themselves they can possibly be.\n  ","398622":"\n  i haven't heard anything about it in quite some time, so i assume it hasn't gone very far at all. it's common knowledge that the earth is spherical, so \"flat earth\" conspiracy theorists are pretty ignorant.\n  ","398623":"\n  i never have, but it's something i've always wanted to do !!\n  ","398624":"\n  i usually avoid people i dislike as much as possible, and if i *do* have to interact with them, i do so on such a professional\/cold basis that all it takes

though it took quite a few trials of medication experimentation, i definitely began to feel the effects of both medication combined with weekly therapy appointments. i felt lighter -- like i had something more to live for, i had a purpose and that was to help other people who have been in similar situations and show them that living life is possible afterall.\n  ","398776":"\n  \"someone you

and\/or the violin. preferably together.\n  ","398779":"\n  i have resting b*tch face, so apparently pretty good. i rarely show emotion on my face unless i'm, like ... hysterically crying or super angry to the point where i'm seeing red.\n  ","398780":"\n  no, not all religious people -- that's a broad statement that certainly doesn't apply to everyone from any kind of religious group. i know plenty of people who follow religion who are open-minded individuals.\n  ","398781":"\n  i took the money from my savings account. i would rather use my money for life-changing experiences than have it sit there and do nothing, especially considering i realistically don't know when i'll pass away. why pass up a once in a lifetime opportunity just because i want to save some cash that i'll eventually earn back anyway?\n  ","398782":"\n  i think it depends on the man, because it depends entirely on genetics (as well as stress levels, from my understanding).\n  ","398783":"\n  we're going to a few different places !! i think nassau is one of them. i don't remember, i'd have to look at the itinerary.\n  ","398784":"\n  yes, i agree. the senate is controlled by republicans, who will obviously support trump. i was happy when he was initially impeached, especially considering its historical context, but i knew it wasn't going to go anywhere, unfortunately.\n  ","398785":"\n  we're

on face-to-face interaction, but online socialization is just as valid as IRL socialization.\n  ","398789":"\n  it's verbal harassment, so yeah.\n  ","398790":"\n  eh, yes and no. there are obviously terrible things going on in the world, which is what the media primarily focuses on when reporting the news. however, there are also great advances in science, medicine, and technology that aren't reported upon nearly as often as the bad news.\n  ","398791":"\n  i prefer mexican (or any sort of spanish) food over chinese food. chinese food is good comfort food, but there's nothing better than homemade cuban food from my boyfriend's father or grandmother after a long day.\n  ","398792":"\n  we have a few pieces of art, but we haven't hung them up yet. i have a work of art hung in my room

or my fault or some sort of compromise in between.\n  ","398801":"\n  i can say with confidence that cashiers give literally zero sh*ts about what a customer is buying. when i worked as a cashier (and in retail in general), i wasn't paying attention to the particular items as much as i was paying attention to whether or not the coupons correctly corresponded with whatever items they were for and if the item was on sale.\n  ","398802":"\n  i honestly have zero clue. i don't own many things that are yellow, it isn't a color i like on myself.\n  ","398803":"\n  that seems ... counter-productive?

of people gravitate to.\n  ","398808":"\n  for me, it's usually \"youtube and chill,\" lmaoo.\n  ","398809":"\n  yeah, that's perfectly fine. it's very informal, but it's technically correct.\n

myself cry for some kind of release.\n  ","398811":"\n  mayonnaise. it literally disgusts me anyway.\n  ","398812":"\n  i was relieved when i left my previous jobs. my first job (well, technically it was multiple jobs in one, just all within the same company) was extremely overwhelming, stressful, and i wasn't respected, so i was very relieved when i quit that job.\n  \n  my job prior to my current job was also a relief when i quit, because there was also a lot of stress, extremely short and unrealistic deadlines, and irrational management. they favored certain people over others, and we were constantly being scrutinized. i miss my old coworkers from that job, but i still keep in touch with a few of them.\n  ","398813":"\n  no, i didn't watch the superbowl. i don't like most sports.\n  ","398814":"\n  i've been more stable the past few days than i have been since my boyfriend's dog passed away, so yeah. i still have other personal concerns and dilemmas going on, so i have been a bit moody, but that isn't out of the ordinary for me.\n  ","398815":"\n  my day has been going fine thus far. i was late to work this morning because of traffic, which wasn't too great, but the day was overall very productive.\n  \n  i got home from work about an hour ago, and i quickly did some dishes and took a long, hot shower. i'm just relaxing on my laptop & listening to music for now.\n  ","398816":"\n  eh, i wouldn't pay anything more than $20 for an entree. i feel like that's a bit *too* much, unless i wanted to really splurge on some sort of steak dish with multiple sides.\n

chronic condition, then no. i don't have any physical health concerns at the moment.\n  ","398819":"\n  for me personally, it's much easier to warm myself up when i'm cold. you can layer on as many layers as you need. however, when it's too hot outside, there are only so many layers you can take off.\n  ","398820":"\n  yeah, but only on floors of rooms i know are \"safe,\" like my bedroom floor, for example. and only if it's only been on the floor for less than 5 seconds, lmaoo.\n  ","398821":"\n  it's really compelling !! i watched the first season a while ago and enjoyed it, and the second season just came out.\n  ","398822":"\n  they're equally as challenging. you cannot compare mental illness to physical illness because they both come with their own battles.\n  ","398823":"\n  coffee motivates me to get out of bed in the morning -- most mornings, at least. sometimes there is no motivation whatsoever, but thankfully i haven't had a relapse in depression in a few months.\n  ","398824":"\n  because i enjoy it. i do a lot of things that are bad for my health. having a drink once or twice per week isn't necessarily a bad thing, at any rate.\n  ","398825":"\n  if you're asking if i drink alcohol, then yes.\n  ","398826":"\n  not very often. this is the last photo i took sometime last week.\n  ","398827":"\n  tbh, i never get that much money back whenever i file my taxes, and i'm afraid to file my taxes this year because i did so much freelance work in 2019. :\/\n  \n  if anything, it would go towards my credit card bills and loans.\n  ","398828":"\n  no, i've never been fired from a job before. i've given two weeks' notice for every job i've had and then quit thereafter.\n  ","398829":"\n  it's nearly 7:00pm, and i'm not even hungry so i don't know what i want to make for dinner yet. i'll probably just heat up some rice and vegetables, or i'll order takeout. i haven't had sushi in a while.\n  ","398830":"\n  i'm not in college. when i attended college, i studied professional writing, communications, and english literature.\n  ","398831":"\n  shaving half of my head is one of the many rash decisions i have made for myself.\n  ","398832":"\n  ah, well you're right -- at least you did your part. perhaps the future will hold a different story, but for now the only thing you can do is continue living your life.\n  ","398833":"\n  probably, it's bound to get a bit chilly at night.\n  ","398834":"\n  definitely not enough water, that's for certain. lmaoo.\n  \n  i've been trying to drink more often, though. i'll have two big glasses when i get home from work, and i try to drink a thermos or two while i'm working.\n  ","398835":"\n  \"i am a killer\" on netflix. it's a documentary about inmates who have m*rdered other people.\n  ","398836":"\n  i haven't !! i didn't know a previous movie existed, haha.\n  ","398837":"\n  i have a bachelor's degree in communications\/professional writing and a minor in english literature.\n  ","398838":"\n  i don't really know the dynamic of your relationship, so saying it's been two days doesn't really mean much. for some people, two days is a lot, while for others, it's such a small increment of time.\n  \n  do what you think is best. if texting her after only two days is what you think is best, then try that. personally, i believe things are better discussed in person though.\n  ","398839":"\n  i prefer gatorade over powerade, for some reason. lmao.\n  \n  i like the light blue one, idk what it's even called.\n  ","398840":"\n  every other month of the year is in celebration of white people. don't get ahead of yourself.\n  ","398841":"\n  probably around 90-100 mph.\n  ","398842":"\n  recognize the importance of black history, the accomplishments of black people, and how much progressed we as a society have made\/still have yet to make in establishing racial equality.\n  ","398843":"\n  i'm fairly humble, but i also do acknowledge my strengths and have no issue with asserting myself when i know that my knowledge is correct.\n  ","398844":"\n  i'm generally a non-believer with the exception of aliens\/extraterrestrials. i firmly believe that aliens exist and that the government is hiding their existence from the public in an effort to learn new, advanced technology.\n  ","398845":"\n  oh sh*t, that's really intriguing !! i'll have to look that up one day.\n  \n  as for myself, i don't even know what my blood type is, LOL.\n  ","398846":"\n  realistically, i would be an anti-hero. someone like the punisher who does questionable things with a gray moral compass for the greater good.\n  ","398847":"\n  i heard a conspiracy theory today about the coronavirus, and how people believe it came from the chinese CDC in an effort to experiment with an epidemic to see how it would affect the masses.\n  \n  my coworker brought it up briefly in conversation today. i'll have to look into it more.\n  ","398848":"\n  napoleon dynamite came out when i was in high school (i think), and everyone raved about how hilarious it was. when i watched it, i didn't see the big deal and thought it was an awful movie.\n  ","398849":"\n  i prefer psychological thrillers or anything that has to do with mental health\/mental illness, as well as art and romance. my favorite books are ;\n  \n  -- \"girl interrupted\" by susanna kaysen.\n  \n  -- \"the gargoyle\" by andrew davidson.\n  \n  -- \"the secret history\" by donna tartt.\n  \n  -- \"the shining\" by stephen king.\n  \n  -- \"interview with a vampire\" by anne rice.\n  \n  -- \"american psycho\" by bret easton ellis.\n  \n  -- \"echo\" by francesca lia block.\n  ","398850":"\n  childish gambino is the first artist who comes to mind. i love his music.\n  ","398851":"\n  almost every morning, LOL. my jaw isn't really aligned well, so i tend to sleep with my mouth open, which causes me to drool.\n  ","398852":"\n  music is one of the strongest things that makes me feel super nostalgic for the past, especially in terms of early 2000s emo\/alternative rock songs.\n  ","398853":"\n  i was a straight A student in high school, and i took multiple AP classes which earned me college credits. in college, i obtained high marks as well, and i graduated magna cum laude (second highest level of distinction with a college degree).\n  ","398854":"\n  i honestly don't know half of these, lmaoo.\n  \n  zodiac sign -- scorpio.\n  \n  MBTI personality type -- INFJ.\n  \n  hogwarts house -- slytherin.\n  \n  i mean ... i guess they represent me, somewhat? my personality is forever changing, but there are some key points of each thing that resonate within me.\n  ","398855":"\n  plenty of movies have made me cry, haha. i think the most poignant one was les miserables, though. it's my go-to film when i feel the need to release through crying excessively.\n  ","398856":"\n  i like homemade vegetable soup, as well as broccoli cheddar soup, tomato basil soup, and potato soup.\n  \n  as for other dishes, i enjoy sushi, healthy burrito bowls, basically any kind of pasta, and any sort of breakfast food (except waffles and pancakes, ugh).\n  ","398857":"\n  i express myself much better, much more easily, online than IRL. i'm not good at verbally expressing my feelings or even explaining situations, which is why i'm so drawn to social media and the internet in general. they provide me with an outlet where i can express myself.\n  \n  otherwise, i think my personality, or lack thereof, is the same. i become attached to online friends just as i become attached to IRL friends all the same.\n  ","398858":"\n  i don't see forgiveness within me for quite a long, long time.\n  ","398859":"\n  i don't take baths. i shower every other day, though.\n  ","398860":"\n  yes, i use twitter. my account is private, though.\n  ","398861":"\n  i don't remember who cybergirl is. but yeah, i follow ari & michaela on other social media.\n  ","398862":"\n  LOL, it's all good. i figured it was you.\n  \n  ily too !!\n  ","398863":"\n  is this candace? lol.\n  \n  either way, you're welcome. :'))\n  ","398864":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree. most people, i've learned, will refuse to understand what others have been through because it's something they cannot fathom themselves -- and therefore, they reject the notion completely.\n  \n  your feelings are totally valid, though. it's perfectly common and normal to be triggered by certain songs associated with bad memories.\n  ","398865":"\n  i enjoy following\n  \n   @misphire\n  \n  and\n  \n   @psyquietrist\n  \n  !!\n  \n  they're both incredibly sweet, caring, selfless, and thoughtful individuals with their own individual senses of creativity. i've always enjoyed reading answers to their questions, and i believe that their dedication to their sons is remarkable. i also have them both added on other social media and have loved watching their progress over the years.\n  ","398866":"\n  nah, i don't believe you're being too sensitive. i would have reacted in the same manner. if someone isn't putting out the same effort as you are, and they're not even considering you when making plans anymore, then that's something that either needs to be addressed or cut off completely.\n  \n  i've never had an issue with cutting people off, though. but that's just me, lol.\n  ","398867":"\n  neither. music doesn't trigger me because music has always been a comfort in my life, and if anything, the music i listened to during my darkest days have become comfort songs to me in my adult life.\n  \n  i also don't think it's ridiculous for people to be triggered by songs, though. music conjures strong memories and it's very normal and common for others to be triggered by music.\n  ","398868":"\n  personally, i would allow some time for your friend to cool off and go back into a steady mindset before bringing the topic up again. people need space, and sometimes that space allows for greater thoughts into the subject. at that point, i believe it's appropriate for you to reach out (whether by text, or even better, in person) after that waiting period to explain what you meant and that you didn't intend to upset them. you acknowledge that you upset them and you apologize for it coming to that point, but it was a misunderstanding and you want to correct the wrongs.\n  ","398869":"\n  i think it depends on what you're buying, whether or not you're getting sale items or store brand items, etc etc. there are also discounted stores like aldi or lidl that offer healthy products for a cheaper price.\n  \n  i do think it says something about america that unhealthy\/fast food costs so much less than buying a salad (for example).\n  ","398870":"\n  i absolutely love going to concerts and other various shows. the last big concert i went to was to see AJR, mike shinoda, death cab for cutie, florence and the machine, and muse at the barclays center in brooklyn over a year ago.\n  \n  however, i recently saw a few friends play a local gig two weeks ago.\n  ","398871":"\n  i agree wholeheartedly. i was raised in an environment where there wasn't much privacy at all (i didn't even have a bedroom door, for gods' sake). when i wrote in journals, my parents would find the journals and read them. it's the main reason why i resorted to the internet -- it was a way for me to document and discuss my feelings, particularly with others, without my parents finding out because the internet history had disappeared by the time they had checked the computer when i had gone to bed.\n  ","398872":"\n  it always makes me happy when clients email me to tell me that my team did a great job with their product, whether it was the design or the writing itself. it makes all of the other angry emails seem worthless, haha.\n  \n  i didn't get much feedback from anyone when i worked in retail, but my boyfriend has a letter from a customer hanging on his fridge at his house. it was about two paragraphs long, explaining how thorough and helpful of a manager he is and how he has made her experience at the store worthwhile and fulfilling. it was ridiculously sweet.\n  ","398873":"\n  my graduating class was rowdy, to say the very least. instead of pulling normal senior pranks, my graduating class (well, only a select 10-15 people) ended up vandalizing the building, spraypainting employee cars, and slashing the security guards' tires.\n  ","398874":"\n  well, it isn't really a matter of him being \"allowed\" to or not. if he consumes sugar, he just has to maintain his insulin levels and watch them closely. regardless, he uses artificial sugar in his coffee and whatnot. it doesn't prevent him from eating junk food, though.\n  ","398875":"\n  probably at some point or another. i took 2 or 3 philosophy classes, including a mandatory \"ethics\" class when i was a sophomore in college.\n  ","398876":"\n  i don't use any of those messaging services. the only ways i message people are through facebook messenger or texting.\n  ","398877":"\n  i've collected some stickers over the years, which i've placed on my laptop, haha. most of them are stickers of artwork from a close friend of mine who sells his work as a side gig.\n  ","398878":"\n  my boyfriend has type 1 diabetes.\n  ","398879":"\n  haha, yeah. i never checked the history in the morning before school, but every night i would erase virtually everything. i wasn't on forbidden websites or anything, but i talked a lot to people on internet forums and art websites (i.e. deviantart), and i revealed a lot of personal information on there regarding my life that would have gotten me into greater trouble with my parents.\n  ","398880":"\n  yes, i believe that's very rude. you should be happy for your friend and their circumstances, and even if you're preoccupied by something enough to the point where you cannot feel that level of excitement for them, i think it would be rude to dismiss their feelings completely.\n  ","398881":"\n  absolutely -- regular physical activity is beneficial for nearly everyone, sans those with conditions that may prevent them from exercising.\n  ","398882":"\n  i think it depends on the child themselves, and what the level of supervision would be. every child is different, so it would be incorrect to place a universal \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to such a question.\n  \n  i was largely unsupervised when it came to my internet access as a teenager, but i do took great strides in erasing my browsing history and cookies every night.\n  ","398883":"\n  i honestly don't remember most of them. however, with my current job, we had a client (who we eventually dropped) who told a sales representative that he wrote a book. our editorial department researched the book to get a better understanding of the client's history, and it was all about how he had a psychotic breakdown and m*rdered his wife and children.\n  \n  ... needless to say, my company didn't want to represent someone who k*lled someone else. it was certainly strange. we've also had clients who have claimed to have been touched by god, spoken to the angels, \"supercharged\" by the divine, etc etc.\n  ","398884":"\n  i've heard of the show, but i've never watched it before.\n  ","398885":"\n  i hope all is well with you too !! :'))\n  \n  today was somewhat of a stressful day, but also productive. i came home from work to find out my roommate is sick with pneumonia, so i wiped down every single surface of the house and lysol'd the sh*t out of every room. i *cannot* afford to get sick right now.\n  ","398886":"\n  i'm indifferent to valentine's day. ideally, you should be valuing and appreciating your partner on a regular basis, not just on a very specific commercialized holiday that profits off of people's love or lust for one another.\n  ","398887":"\n  i've never had strange jobs in themselves, but i've most definitely had strange customers and clients. back when i worked in a retail environment, i encountered unusual people every day. it got to a point where it wasn't surprising anymore.\n  ","398888":"\n  regardless of a person's gender, i generally notice a person's height, hair, and smile first.\n  ","398889":"\n  besides my own, the last house i went to was my parents' house.\n  ","398890":"\n  yes, baroque architecture is absolutely beautiful. i just looked up some examples online, and the attention to detail and complexities of design are astounding.\n  ","398891":"\n  yes, i have a tendency to stress out a lot over various situations, ranging from significant issues to not-so significant issues.\n  ","398892":"\n  not only is it unprofessional, but it goes against HIPAA confidential rules.\n  ","398893":"\n  i don't really think it's a matter of luck -- i've just always taken care of my hair throughout the years. i've always gone to professional salons to get it done, i don't use heat on my hair, i condition it regularly, i use color-safe shampoos and conditioners, etc etc.\n  ","398894":"\n  i'm confused as to how to navigate through a particular project at work that i encountered today. recently, i switched up how the program works to streamline it more efficiently with both the editorial department and graphic design department, so i need to really sit down and think about how to best approach the situation.\n  ","398895":"\n  no, i don't like milky way bars. i'm not a huge fan of candy or chocolate to begin with.\n  ","398896":"\n  yes, it did !! comparing my current photo to the previous photo i took for my job's magazine a few months ago, it's grown at least two inches.\n  ","398897":"\n  i have a twitch account, but i don't stream anything on there. i'm only on there to watch my friends' streams, haha. i don't even know what my username is at this point.\n  ","398898":"\n  i rarely eat doritos, but i do like them. my favorite are the cool ranch doritos.\n  ","398899":"\n  i seldom wear shorts unless i absolutely *have* to during the summer.\n  ","398900":"\n  whenever my friends and i go out, we frequent one specific local bar down in town. we've been going there ever since we turned 21, haha.\n  ","398901":"\n  my instagram is private, and i only accept follow requests from people i know and have spoken to extensively.\n  ","398902":"\n  i don't get my nails done, and i believe the last time i got a manicure was perhaps two years ago.\n  ","398903":"\n  they haven't been right in my face, but i've woken up plenty of times to one of the cats screaming at me, jumping up on my windowsill, trotting all over my bed, etc etc.\n  ","398904":"\n  i much prefer autumn over the spring -- the chilly weather soothes me, i love the seasonal food and drinks, i love being cozy in boots and sweaters, and the colors on the trees are beautiful.\n  ","398905":"\n  aw, this is so sweet to come home to. thank you so much ~~\n  ","398906":"\n  yes, i studied the bible when i was much younger. i took religion classes as a child.\n  ","398907":"\n  i haven't been to the beach in like two years, lmaoo.\n  ","398908":"\n  put my lunch bag away, take off my jacket, and take my medication.\n  ","398909":"\n  i prefer the beach over the pool. i've never been a fan of pools, especially if there are other people in them.\n  ","398910":"\n  nah, i've never even heard of that place before, lol.\n  ","398911":"\n  i've been to a bunch of different shops.\n  ","398912":"\n  not usually, no. i tend to fall asleep between 11pm and 1am.\n  ","398913":"\n  being paid less than other workers,

out of fear, it's because you're focusing on the possible repercussions of your actions. you're more focused on doing things correctly to that other person's standards.\n  \n  when you perform an activity for someone out of respect, you're focusing on how to better the activity for everyone involved, whether it's just you, you and your boss, or you and an entire team. there's a sense of comradery that exists because everyone is working towards the same goal.\n  ","398918":"\n  i honestly can't think of a single good thing that happened in january, lmaoo. january was horrible for a lot of people, and i struggled with various things throughout the course of the month.\n  \n  however, february is looking much brighter. i have the cruise in a few weeks, which i'm very much looking

countries, however, the common flu is one of the deadliest it's been in ages, and i think that's largely due to its mutation over the years, as well as the lack of care people put in to not washing their hands, not vaccinating themselves and their children, etc etc.\n  \n  the coronavirus has also led to a lot of racism -- there are so many people who are being racist towards chinese people for

engines.\n  ","398924":"\n  i don't really feel much disappointment -- instead, i feel anger. the last time i was angry was at one of my coworkers who undermined my authority (as well as the authority of both of our superiors) because of something they personally didn't want to do. it eventually went to upper management, and an email was sent out regarding a broad, overall topic related to similar

with medical conditions who cannot stand for that long amount of time, who also cannot afford to go see a doctor to obtain a doctor's note. health care alone in this country is a privilege, not a

I told him we're just friends, nothing else and he said he knows but still wants to do it in the future. I found that odd, am I wrong for that? Because of those reasons, I'm considering telling him I'd like to cease communication and wishing him luck. 1) I don't want him to unrealistic expectations abt our relationship 2) I dislike his mentality.

Tysm for reading this.\n  \n  --\n  \n  i wouldn't tolerate antisemitism in any form, so that's an immediate turn-off for me. obviously he's set in his ways and to have such a strong dislike for a group of people who are usually genuinely good is wrong in itself. jewish people are already marginalized so much in society, even in the united states.\n  \n  as for the whole going out on dates thing, it *does* seem a bit pushy and it sounds a bit like he doesn't want to respect your boundaries and just remain friends. he seems to expect more out of the relationship than what you have in mind, and that may cause conflict in the future.\n  \n  i don't think it's out of line for you to want to cease communication with him. the bigotry, for one, being the biggest thing of all, and then him acting like he wants to be in a relationship with you even though you clearly said no is another big indicator. personally speaking, i would feel uncomfortable and trust my own instincts.\n

is the irish car bomb.\n  ","399049":"\n  chloe price from the video game \"life is strange.\"\n  ","399050":"\n  i suppose from my teenagehood -- i was determined to get out of my living circumstances, and that served as a catalyst for the way i applied myself in most circumstances, whether it was school or work.\n  ","399051":"\n  s*icide.\n  ","399052":"\n  my boyfriend made me laugh this evening, if that counts for anything.\n  ","399053":"\n  i think my maturity level matches my age.\n  ","399054":"\n  yeah, i find them to be relaxing as long as i'm somewhere comfortable and it's daylight.\n  ","399055":"\n  i watch documentaries fairly often, and most of them are true crime documentaries. i'm currently in the middle of watching a documentary called \"pandemic\" about various disease outbreaks across the world.\n  ","399056":"\n  homemade vegetable soup, broccoli cheddar soup, potato soup, new england clam chowder, and tomato basil soup are my favorites.\n  ","399057":"\n  i never learned how to ride a bicycle.\n  ","399058":"\n  however long he wants. there's really no set time a person should wait, it just depends on the feelings they have and what their intuition tells them.\n  ","399059":"\n  s*icide, mainly.\n  ","399060":"\n  depends on the company. if someone is going to talk the entire time the movie is on, then i would prefer to be alone.\n  ","399061":"\n  i just woke up from an accidental nap after loading myself into a carb coma, lmaoo. now i'm watching criminal minds and checking my inbox.\n  \n  there isn't really much else on my mind.\n  ","399062":"\n  not really, no. influenza already k*lls tens of thousands of people in the united states alone per year. around 8,000 people have already died in the 2019-2020 season alone. an outbreak of a new strain of virus isn't all that surprising to me.\n  ","399063":"\n  i wear jeans most of the time, but i also wear leggings.\n  ","399064":"\n  there are actually text hotlines.\n  ","399065":"\n  yes, i play video games.\n  ","399066":"\n  rent, lmaoo.\n  ","399067":"\n  well, this is racist to say the very least.\n  ","399068":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","399069":"\n  ???\n  \n  it's illogical to think that you *can't* have children after the age of 30. i believe after 35, the risks increase but to say you cannot have kids at all is silly.\n  ","399070":"\n  definitely a yay !! i order chinese food every 2-3 weeks or so, and it's such a comfort food when i'm feeling down.\n  ","399071":"\n  i've never had one particular favorite color, i've always just preferred earth tones over everything else though.\n  ","399072":"\n  i went to a brewery tonight for some drinks with a coworker, and there was a giant puppy just chilling at the bar and greeting everyone who walked by. it was the greatest thing ever.\n  ","399073":"\n  i don't generally celebrate valentine's day, but the cruise i'm going on is embarking on the day after valentine's day, so that's a bit of a gift in itself. haha.\n  ","399074":"\n  yes, minecraft is one of my favorite games. i haven't played it in a while, though.\n  ","399075":"\n  of course -- any sort of thought that someone puts into my birthday is appreciated.\n  ","399076":"\n  i'm going on a cruise in february !! everything else is pretty meaningless, lmaoo.\n  ","399077":"\n  no, i don't hate any coworkers. \"hate\" is a very strong word only reserved for certain people in my life, and that does not apply to my coworkers.\n  ","399078":"\n  in theory, things are pretty terrible. but i'm feeling fine right now because i just got back from the brewery and i'm feeling pretty buzzed.\n  ","399079":"\n  definitely not. i don't check social media often while i'm at work unless i'm on a break.\n  ","399080":"\n  i've never liked using backpacks, even in high school. i've always used a messenger bag or a pocketbook.\n  ","399081":"\n  oh right, i forgot that after the age of 30, your ability to have children suddenly disappears.\n  ","399082":"\n  thankfully, no. other people in my grade had to do so, but i ended up with the teacher who didn't do that same project.\n  ","399083":"\n  eventually, sure. like i said, though, it isn't a priority between us.\n  ","399084":"\n  i administer to multiple programs and i have a bit of leverage in the company because i'm of a higher status than the other editors in the company.\n  ","399085":"\n  i mean ... maybe? lmaoo.\n  \n  i don't really concern myself with that. i just care about doing the job right and with the right amount of efficiency.\n  ","399086":"\n  i don't normally nap, and i sleep between 4-8 hours per night.\n  ","399087":"\n  yes, i actually just got home from having a few drinks with a coworker at a local brewery, haha.\n  ","399088":"\n  i never definitively said i never wanted children. i just don't believe i can confidently have kids at this point in my life.\n  \n  perhaps when i'm older -- maybe. but it isn't a priority for me, and i want to work on myself first before deciding to take care of someone else.\n  ","399089":"\n  this was my first baby betta from three years ago before he passed away. unfortunately, i don't have any tanks anymore and i don't have any full-length photos of his set up.\n  ","399090":"\n  i would most definitely accept it, and i would get jaw surgery to give myself a stronger jawline. i've always found strong jawlines to be very attractive, and i think i would be more confident in myself if my jaw was more defined.\n  ","399091":"\n  i was raised catholic, but i've never actually been very religious. even when i was attending church and religion classes, i don't think i ever truly believed in god. after i went through my confirmation, i told my parents that i didn't believe in god and i stopped pursuing any sort of religious ventures.\n  ","399092":"\n  i'm not really a member of my community, so i honestly don't know. i've never had a strong sense of community with where i live -- i barely know my neighbors, and all i really do is go to work, go to the store, and come home. i'm a regular at a few bars and coffee shops, but that's the extent of my involvement.\n  ","399093":"\n  my specialty is oversharing my trauma and past experiences, and then making dark and awkward jokes when the people around me become too uncomfortable. lmaoo.\n  ","399094":"\n  if i'm feeling just sad, then listening to music, venting to friends, and playing video games cheers me up (or at least distracts me until the mood lifts).\n  \n  if i'm in the middle of a depressive episode, then nothing cheers me up. it's simply a waiting game to see when the fog will lift.\n  ","399095":"\n  my morning cup of coffee. ?\n  ","399096":"\n  january 2020 has honestly flown by, and i feel as if new years' day was only last week, LOL. it was honestly a pretty terrible month, though. there have been so many personal conflicts and happenings in my life which have brought me down, both mentally and physically. all of the political and environmental issues have been weighing heavy on my heart as well.\n  ","399097":"\n  i use just regular purell hand sanitizer, and i also have one that the representatives of my health insurance company gave my department that has a really pleasant, but light, lemon aroma to it.\n  ","399098":"\n  yes, i am currently in love.\n  ","399099":"\n  my day has been productive, but exhausting. i spent the majority of the day at work, where i've been intensely training my coworker for the past two days. after work, i went straight to my parents' house for a family gathering, and i was there for almost three hours. i only got home at like 9:15pm.\n  \n  after i got home, i immediately put my pajamas on and grabbed a beer from the fridge, lmaoo.\n  ","399100":"\n  no, i've never had surgery before. i've received stitches on a few occasions, but that has been my extent of medical maladies.\n  ","399101":"\n  i probably have at some point, but i honestly can't remember. i have tried various kinds of sushi, so i'm assuming octopus or squid were in one of them. fried calamari is one of my favorite foods, though.\n  ","399102":"\n  nah, i've honestly never saw the point in gambling. i wouldn't want to risk losing money in the slim chance that i might win it back and then some. i've never even played lotto.\n  ","399103":"\n  well, it's wednesday night and the week is about halfway over. i'm planning on seeing my coworker for drinks tomorrow night, and then on friday i have a few errands to run before i go home after work. i need to go shopping for a gift before saturday, and then saturday night is my aunt's retirement party.\n  ","399104":"\n  no, i was never really close to any of my teachers or professors. i had one teacher in high school to whom i was semi-close -- i emailed him during my freshman year of college to get his advice on something, but we haven't spoken since.\n  \n  i also have another teacher of mine added on my facebook, but we don't really interact at all. she was the coolest science teacher i've ever had, though.\n  ","399105":"\n  i've reverted back to playing skyrim on a daily basis again, lol. it's my go-to game whenever i'm stressed out because it feels like home to me, and i've essentially been playing it for six years straight at this point.\n  \n  i also started playing red dead redemption 2, which has been fun with its online capabilities. i've played with friends a few times. i also downloaded halo: reach for the master chief collection and did a few missions on that recently as well.\n  ","399106":"\n  i work a monday through friday job, so mondays are always the hardest days of the week for me, lol. to look ahead for five days and remember that i have to wake up early, commute to work, work for 8.5 hours, and then commute home is absolutely exhausting.\n  ","399107":"\n  i prefer cheeseburgers cooked on the barbecue, as well as hot dogs and sausages. it just tastes better over the grill as opposed to being cooked in the kitchen over the stove.\n  ","399108":"\n  you're definitely not alone in this at all !! i constantly have random words, phrases, or just mash-ups of different sounds get stuck in my head all the time, to the point where the words themselves become distorted and i over-analyze their sounds. it begins to disintegrate and not sound like a \"real\" word anymore.\n  ","399109":"\n  at the moment, no (surprisingly). i think it's because i'm hearing my roommate's video game from the other room, though, so that's currently occupying my head.\n  ","399110":"\n  i'm somewhat of an extroverted introvert, if that makes any sense. i'm introverted in the way that being around a lot of people completely drains me, and i require time alone in order to recharge. however, i can act extroverted when i'm with a very small group of friends and i thoroughly enjoy spending time with my close friends.\n  ","399111":"\n  i'm afraid of being abandoned by those closest to me. i have an irrational fear that all of my friends secretly hate me and only talk to me because they feel bad, for whatever reason that would be. i'm terrified that everyone is going to get fed up with me and leave.\n  ","399112":"\n  i've visited manhattan on countless occasions for a variety of reasons, whether it's just for a random day trip or to go to museums and art galleries or to see a play or musical.\n  ","399113":"\n  my bedroom wall, which is adorned with a beautiful tapestry and string lights (which are colored blue right now).\n  ","399114":"\n  yes, i'm very much a perfectionist. i have to double-check everything i do to make sure it's done correctly, and i always put in 110% in everything i do, especially when it comes to work. i've always relied on myself instead of other people in terms of projects because i simply cannot trust other people to do the same level of quality work that i do.\n  ","399115":"\n  listen to music -- that's the first thing that comes to mind. there's nothing better and more relaxing than coming home from a hectic day at work, putting on relaxing music, and closing my eyes while listening for a few minutes. the solitude and quietness of the music calms me down a lot and brings me back to a state of peace.\n  ","399116":"\n  at the moment, i'm a senior editor and writer at a publishing company.\n  ","399117":"\n  i'm thinking about the few things i have to do before this weekend, which includes going shopping for a gift, going to the bank, paying rent, and attending my aunt's retirement party on saturday. i'm also going out for drinks with one of my coworkers tomorrow night.\n  ","399118":"\n  a woman can be whoever she wants to be. there should never be any limitations or expectations when it comes to *how* a woman should behave, that's a misogynistic form of thinking.\n  ","399119":"\n  no, i wasn't popular in middle school or high school. i was known by my peers, but i didn't have a lot of friends.\n  ","399120":"\n  my secret is camera filters. my skin is actually pretty bad right now, and i don't do anything to take care of my skin except for an exfoliating gel in the shower and a nourishing moisturizer after i get out of the shower.\n  ","399121":"\n  yes, i vape. i quit smoking cigarettes last september.\n  ","399122":"\n  i went hiking once when i was a freshman in college -- it was part of our orientation, we hiked a mountain in massachusetts as a group bonding activity, haha.\n  ","399123":"\n  i don't believe i've ever had deep-fried mushrooms before.\n  ","399124":"\n  if you're talking about the novel by lewis carroll, then no. i don't believe i've ever read \"alice in wonderland\" either.\n  ","399125":"\n  people can take whoever they want out on dates, regardless of their gender. this line of thinking insinuates that dating only happens to heterosexual couples, when obviously a multitude of genders and orientations exist.\n  ","399126":"\n  no, i've never been arrested before. i definitely should have at multiple moments in my life, but i walked away unscathed. lol.\n  ","399127":"\n  thankfully, no. i was a bit on the older side when his music first started getting popular.\n  ","399128":"\n  my relationship with ginger is a bit weird. i enjoy ginger tea, but i don't like eating actual ginger. i also don't like cold drinks with ginger in it, like moscow mules for example.\n  ","399129":"\n  my boyfriend is definitely a much better cook than me, lol. he knows how to cook more meals than i do, and he makes the best empanadas.\n  ","399130":"\n  no, i've never seen the point in spending real money on social media. i have the coins that i have through asking and answering questions, as well as whatever coins people give me for my answers every day.\n  ","399131":"\n  yes, i had work today. i spent 8.5 hours at work, and then went to my parents' house for a small family gathering. i just got home perhaps 30 minutes ago (for reference, it's 9:45pm).\n  ","399132":"\n  the last person i met for the very first time was perhaps a coworker of mine who has been working for the company for quite a few months now. i don't really have many opportunities (nor the desire) to meet new people.\n  ","399133":"\n  i suppose that depends entirely on what they did to screw up the first chance they were given.\n  ","399134":"\n  i've had maybe 3-4 different accounts, but i've been using askfm as a whole since around 2012. since i've been going through my 20s during my entire time using askfm, i've changed significantly. i've gotten a college degree, a few job changes, new cars, moved into a new house, etc etc.\n  ","399135":"\n  it depends on the restaurant. some restaurants charge for the service, while others don't. if anything, i've only seen a $3 charge at the very most for delivery service.\n  ","399136":"\n  i'm currently watching \"pandemic,\" which is a new documentary on netflix about epidemics across the world, like avian flu and swine flu and whatnot. it's incredibly interesting.\n  \n  as for true crime documentaries, \"making a murderer\" was obviously great. i also liked \"abducted in plain sight,\" \"don't f**k with cats,\" \"the staircase,\" \"the confession tapes,\" and \"confessions with a killer: the ted bundy tapes.\"\n  ","399137":"\n  no, they're just unnecessarily terrible things that have no real educational value, they're just bad. between getting severely ill in the beginning of the month to having to put my boyfriend's dog down last sunday, it's just been a bad month.\n  ","399138":"\n  my family told me i had jewish heritage.\n  ","399139":"\n  picrew.me, i believe the site was !!\n  ","399140":"\n  i like unsweetened iced tea, as well as various semi-sweet flavors of iced tea, like peach and raspberry.\n  \n  as for regular tea, i normally drink herbal teas with no sugar or milk or honey or anything else.\n  ","399141":"\n  i prefer to call my boyfriend, but text everyone else. i'm not much of a fan of video chatting.\n  ","399142":"\n  i enjoy singing, but i'm terrible at it. lmaoo.\n  ","399143":"\n  my little succulent sanctuary on my desk. \u2661\n  ","399144":"\n  january has honestly been a terrible month, between all of the social and political news, as well as things going on in my personal life -- the month isn't even over yet & it feels like an entire year.\n  ","399145":"\n  from my understanding, race and heritage are biological while culture is more of a social construct. many races have their own unique cultures, but if you're of a particular race and have been *around* a different culture instead of being a direct member of that culture, i don't think it's right to identify as that race or culture. you can simply say you're close with that culture and understand it, not that it's *your* culture.\n  ","399146":"\n  i actually took a DNA test last year and it showed that i was a significant amount of ashkenazi jewish, as well as ukrainian, german, austrian, italian, etc etc.\n  \n  even though i knew i had jewish in me as a heritage, the percentage was around 20-25% which was a lot more than expected. however, i was raised catholic and no one ever spoke about the jewish traditions in my earlier family ancestry. i'm comfortable stating that i have jewish ancestry, but i wouldn't feel comfortable reclaiming slurs or anything of the sort because i wasn't raised with that cultural significance.\n  ","399147":"\n  i like questions related to my personal interests, i.e. hobbies (such as writing, reading, and video games), mental health, documentaries and true crime shows, politics (to an extent), animals, and nature.\n  ","399148":"\n  rest in paradise, my baby. knowing you for over 10 years was such a privilege. you're not suffering anymore & now you're with your brother, it's difficult to accept but knowing you're not in pain at least gives me solace.\n  ","399149":"\n  nah, i used a website for it. that isn't my drawing style, haha.\n  ","399150":"\n  i normally use doordash or grubhub. i've never had anything wild happen to me, and my orders have always been accurate.\n  ","399151":"\n  definitely not. i hate pedicures to begin with.\n  ","399152":"\n  no,\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  and i are not related.\n  ","399153":"\n  spicy chicken nuggets, french fries, and dr. pepper.\n  ","399154":"\n  no, i've only ever followed it within the past few years.\n  ","399155":"\n  it's extremely toxic to hold grudges, and holding a grudge ultimately hurts you more than it hurts anyone else. even if you cannot forgive someone, holding a grudge against that person is unhealthy. certain things you just have to accept and allow them to be.\n  "}}
