  Any planet small enough for him to destroy would not be classified as a planet. Like asteroids. Way Big can destroy mountains and other objects that are huge to us, but most planets are more than just big rocks.

  Yes, I was involved in all the story breaks and meetings, so I know as much as the actual writers do, I was there. A lot of people think all animation is done prime time style like the Simpsons where the writers are in total control of the show. But in non prime time shows the artists and writers are more equal, or the writers are under the artist Producer. I‚Äôve always contributed story ideas since Teen Titans. Glen Murakami gets frustrated too because people ignore or are unaware of his contributions, and everybody assumes that his ideas were all Dwayne‚Äôs. Glen and Dwayne were equal partners

  Let me tell you something about that guy. He contacted me on insta to ask about unblocking him on twitter. At first he was super arrogant, he told me all his  fans like his art more than mine. I just thought, yeah, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre YOUR fans. Called me sensitive. But he doesn‚Äôt understand the basic information needed for a model sheet pose. So he had too big of an ego to realize his ‚Äúcriticism‚Äù was just uneducated commentary. When I told him I was going to block him on Instagram too, he started freaking out and begging me not to. Then he said everything I did was perfect, as if that is what I wanted to hear. It disgusted me. Listen to me, seriously now. No jokes. I‚Äôm telling you as a person who has lived a long time. You do not want a person like that in your life.
  
  I do not unblock people, that is a hard and fast rule, because I have learned the hard way that people do not change even when you give them second chances.
  
  I do social media for my own enjoyment. I like interacting with 90% of fans. That‚Äôs why I answer your questions and show you art! But I‚Äôm not here to tolerate rudeness and disrespect. Ignorant rudeness is the worst

  I think it would still be unique in a different way because there aren‚Äôt really any biped aliens where there bodies are more dinosaur like than humanoid

  I don‚Äôt always do my designs the same formulaic way but I tend to draw by finding appealing shapes first, then going back in and constructing those shapes into solid looking forms.

  We tried to have her use more spells and magical objects rather than just using Green Lantern type powers. And also had her upgrade her magic with the classic series charms.

  I saw a really bad one the other day. Someone had decided that some totally unrelated original series alien with a completely different design was actually also Bug-Lite. It blew my mind. Ben 10 fans seem to be the worst at putting two matching images together. They are always taking things that look nothing alike and thinking they are the same. Also they thought his name was a reference to the beer Bud Lite. What. The. Hell. That is some grade A dumb-assery right there.

   I know the Omnitrix has shapeshifting aliens. Upgrade and Goop are the best examples. But the Thing doesn't exactly take the form of someone, the Thing BECOMES that person. It assimilates them on a cellular basis. It acts more like a virus than a shapeshifter.

  For me, they are all canon except the crossovers which are imaginary stories until they actually happen

  No the idea for the stream was to do Alien forms that are exclusive to one Omnitrix wielder only, the others don‚Äôt have access. And we couldn‚Äôt do it anyway because the file was corrupted

276784,"
   If you could answer this, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Who would win in a fight:Rath or Ma Vreedle?

  I don't like Zombie Island at all. I don't like reboots where they don't respect, or openly disrespect the source material.

278492,"
   I seem to remember you saying NegaBen's aliens were miscolored and I'm kinda confused as to what kind of color themes he's supposed to have (mostly for the made up alien challenge). What are his color themes?

  On his gas powers and FX were miscolored. His alien forms are all desaturated with grey outfits and grey eyes.

   Was Swift left in the Null Void or she was taken to custody like Rojo and Nyancy Chan?

  Wow. You've never heard a French accent before, have you?

278523,"
   You said XLRG was drawn, is that official art or just rough concept art? And can you post it? I really want to know how that fusion would look

  Thanks, that's what we went for, for the best parts of the original and UAF. I don't regret doing the show. Youngberg and I had talked for years about what we would do with Ben 10 if we got the chance. I always thought of Ben as one of those weird Saturday morning cartoons, like Captian N, or Kid Video, or something. We had a lot of fun on the show, building worlds and awesome records, but the end was very stressful, it was really tough work.

   Did Bezel create his charms in an attempt to add rules to magic?
  ","
  No, he created the charms a very long time ago (he is much older than he looks), during his quest for magical power. The creation of the charms, along with their destruction and recreation over the ensuing years softened the veil of reality that separates our dimension from the Ledger Domain. This weakened the barrier between realities enough for other magic using humans like Hex or Charmcaster or whoever to tap into the power of the LD, as well as eventually letting them enter the other realm.
  "
278744,"

  "
278749,"
   Man Bezel was a riot! A great feature of that episode! Where'd you guys come up with the idea for him?
  ","
  He stems from Youngberg's dislike of the use of magic in the super hero genre. That's why he thinks stage magic tricks are cool, but real magic is a big cheat. For my part, I modeled his outfit a little on my idea of Rincewind from Discworld. It was also my idea to have him be Tom Kenny doing a Charles Nelson Reilly homage. He's very probably a protrusion or aspect of the Amazing Mumbo into the Ben 10 reality.

   Man, it's episodes like this when you realize Paradox can kick some butt. Quick question, with Ultimate Ben being a bad idea and thereby discarded how much of ""Ben 10'000 Returns"" was kept around and used for Omniverse? Like Eon's servants being alternate Ben's. Were there any kept concepts?

  No, I don't think any of that stuff is the same. Plus the servants being alt Bens sounds like a specific plot. In Omniverse, they are just robots.

Target did the same soon after, and as different as fans view the latest series, the toys just weren't different enough from the older series for the retailers' taste.

   That's official: Skurd is definitely the most funniest, cutest, and crazy alien that I ever seen. It makes Ben feels awkward now; this little dude its the perfect upgrade kit for the Omnitrix and its aliens. I can't wait to see more of Skurd right until the end.
