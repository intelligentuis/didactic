  Ok, I like a guy (not going out with him) because he distracted me every time I see him, he’s cute and stuff so my reason is he’s cute and I couldn’t look away and when he’s gone I get back to what I was doing before, so it’s 50% you do and don’t need a reason, but just because you like him won’t mean you’ll be with him, you’ll probably find a guy who appreciated you while you’re being ignored by him, but anything goes too, so you never know.
