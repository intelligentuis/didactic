!","53635":"good afternoon and have a good day . gm there","53636":"i still don t really understand what you re asking . do you mean like how do you can i love someone ? and why ? i mean that s how life works . we meet people , we love people , we don t like people . i mean we are only people . we all have opinions of who we d like to be around . but we love people because of who they are . sometimes we have things in common and we like that about them . sometimes they are completely different and that s also something that some people like . sometimes they don t want anything in common with that other person and they love that . i don t know like i said we re all different . we like different types of people to hang out with . i like people that are good influences . i don t like people that are discriminative . i don t like people that are just rude , disrespectful , have a little morals , and that don t appreciate life . i don t know if that answers your question . that s the best way i understood the question . sorry . you may have to ask it in a different way next time .","53637":"right now i m bout to get some dinner and watch the rest of these urban exploring videos . i might so my blanket . it s falling apart , sadly .","53638":"well it s almost o clock in the afternoon so my day is almost over . but i went and exercised today , twice . i went to a restaurant down the road and ate lunch . i drink a cold one . ? no i m at home watching some urban exploring videos .","53639":". my fianc , family , god i count all those in number one as one ? . singing . gaming . animals . painting . urban exploring","53640":"i don t understand this question","53641":"packed a little bit because i m moving soon . i hung out with my dad i never get to do that . went and saw my mamare and papare . aka my grandma and grandfather coon ass cajun french way of saying them she died a couple years ago . we went to the graves , the cemetery . went out to eat at a really nice restaurant . we went to the river , this is where we ate at and we spent a few hours there . the weather felt great . after that i went back to visit where my ma mare and pa pare used to live and where i grew up at . we visited there for a little and then went and got coffee .","53642":"idk ? i don t think you can bypass the pin . you would have to go to an apple store just tell them you forgot the pin and get them to reset it .","53643":"mostly none of this would make you happy in the end . i mean i ve always wanted to sing and be a little famous and get around but i would never want to be on top of the world famous . power . if i had power i would use it in a good way . i would not abuse it . and money , with money you don t get as many enemies as you with power and fame . this is something my friend just said , it makes alot of sense . at least with money you can keep quiet . in his opinion and i agree with it . i wouldn t want millions and millions and millions of dollars , but just money . so of course , i could get a house for my family . some vehicles for a family . go to school . get some doctoring done with myself . go on a nice vacation . have the wedding i ve always wanted . meet famous people i ve always wanted to see in person . go on explorations i ve always wanted to go on and be able to pay for them . so i d probably choose money , but i don t really care too much for money . honestly , if i possibly had a little bit more than what i have now , i could probably accomplish more . it would make my life a little easier . i wouldn t want millions and billions of dollars . i would just be straight up miserable honestly .","53644":"i really enjoy singing ? . that s my everything , my love , my passion . with that i d like to entertain and be creative . i don t know exactly what i could do with my singing but i don t really care what it would be . just if i could be more successful with it . get out there more with the world and maybe inspire people even more than i already feel like i do . would really enjoy doing that . that s honestly probably my dream job . i love animals and plants so anything around that would be a dream job for me honestly . absolutely love marine animals . would love to work around those types of creatures . if i could do any sort of hurricane pick up , cleaning , or preparation . i would like to do a job like that . i ve always wanted to be a meteorologist but the amount of schooling it takes to get up there . . not worth it to me . too much money . too much time . i enjoy cajun food . i am from the south . i like making boiled foods like boiled crawfish , boiled crabs , or ? boil shrimp ? . like to make many southern dishes . i wouldn t mind helping make some food ? taste yummy !","53645":"? ? ?","53646":". i really don t understand why y all don t look at biographies ? and pictures ? before you ask people to become their girlfriends ? why don t you do that . . i don t even know you . . again go and look at my profile .","53647":"good for you lol","53648":"good afternoon .","53649":"i m not sure what you mean by favorite picture ?
