middle of summer so we had a fan in the window and the toaster was on the counter top next to it . i didnt go anywhere near the window nor the counter and starting walking back towards the front door when the fan just fell out the window and the toaster almost landed in the family s dogs water bowl . . . i looked out the window and around in the floor to see if there was maybe a little rodent running around but there was nothing running around inside or anything outside that would ve made it just fall . then we went to a haunted prison for like a family reunion day before we went and grabbed lunch together . we were down in the lower level that s like the basement area i think it was called the isolation cells or something and i begin to feel really nauseated and feeling like overheated and choked off . . so i sat down on an old bench and i just took my phone out and opened the camera app and turned off the flash and just aimed it to look behind me weirdly i didnt notice anything when i was uploading the pictures from that day but on the one specific photo my friend posted out a glare and what appeared to be a face in the area i sat down in . there was also a bunch of
