white supremacy and not trying to change the system is an act of oppression . any white person who is not actively anti racist is racist . it s really not complicated . i m getting the feeling that you re going to keep needling me until you find a loophole in my judgement but there isn t one . i m not sure why you are continuing this over and over at this point . i m not a teacher , i don t write books about racism i don t do lectures . i have given my time freely because it was in good faith but i don t see how this could possibly continue without more of the same picky picky needly questions pulling us around in circles . white people you benefit directly from racism in every breath you take . that makes you culpable and if you re not actively anti racist , then you are racist . if y all want more on this topic , than maybe actually read the book i ve recommended over and over again , so you want to talk about race by ijeoma oluo . it s a bestseller for a good reason . i m not your teacher , and if you think i am , then fucking pay me .","86881":"yes , bring it on make me famous i made a sale like hours ago but it s never enough i want a million followers hitting my

leftover pizza for lunch . i did clean the dishes . i m sort of tired , but not that bad .","86894":"i guess , but also i think that by existing by the current status quo as a white person and not questioning and acting against the way their fellow people of non white skin are treated in the current system you are on the side of oppression racism . these thoughts are not that radical y all . my inbox has been busy with people insulting me and flipping their silly little lids but like , this is progression . this is how we change .","86895":"so many did , i was very lucky in that way . good teachers have pulled me under their wing my whole life . but i think the one that s the most impactful is my high school sculpture teacher , virginia because she s still looking out for me . we re facebook friends and she supports my art wholeheartedly and checks in on me it s really amazing and i love her a lot .","86896":"god damn it i knew this was going to be a fetish","86897":"yes

site with this exact fetish ? they re going to love these answers . i d shrink to hang out with my bird on her swing . i can t think of a reason to grow other than to reach something .","86903":"not really daring i guess but we ended up driving around the desert in california and found this weird art community once and we left our car parked and walked through all this shit while weird ass people stood way back at a distance and just stared at us and occasionally flashed a peace sign or a hang loose sign . it s called east jesus if you want to look it up .","86904":"wonko the sane blathers linda belcher dr . teeth","86905":"milk","86906":"a little lemon quartz ring","86907":"i am so crampy . but otherwise , fine . the melancholy of yesterday s news hasn t affected me much today . also ,

terrible people just without the really embarrassing shock edge lord shit","86915":"sports","86916":"some of the earlier seasons really made me uncomfortable on re watch . like i get it , they re supposed to be the worst of the worst , but also maybe using slurs and doing yellow face aren t the way to show that .","86917":"i can only stand about minutes of tv a day , if that . lately we ve been filling that time with a re watch of all of the it s always sunny in philadelphias","86918":"the only ones i don t roll my eyes at are the ones about bigfoot because those are at least interesting to me . people who believe modern day conspiracies aren t really my kind of people i can t hang with these mock concern foiks making up wild , untrue stories about trafficking when there is like , actual trafficking going on that they don t bat an eye at .","86919":"the extra beta blocker in the afternoon is working well so far , i feel a little less sick . my weekend has been fine , spent today just hanging out with bubo and trying to relax .","86920":"well , if we re talking my bird , life would be pretty good . she got a shower today , got to dry in the sunshine and fresh air , got to eat all her favorite treats almond , millet , parsley , egg got snuggles every time she asked , and is now taking a snooze on a swing .","86921":"not really . maybe in the past . i just love that most cultures have a version of bigfoot , it s like a primal fear of mankind that there s this beast in the woods just out of sight that might be stronger and better at surviving than us .","86922":"thanks and as long as you re creating you re doing just fine","86923":"literally everything , i have panic disorder , which is now back out of remission thanks to","86924":"i would

, no ants","86931":"schitt s creek","86932":"what","86933":"because i think we can all agree that a newborn baby isn t causing oppression . but they will when they grow up ! through little microaggressions and through the institutions they support . even if they re raised right . even if they try hard not to . and as long as they grow into people that can recognize that , work on that actively , and work to change the system that causes this to happen , then we can consider them anti racist and hope they teach their ways to more .","86934":"occasionally .","86935":"the last thing i hate was a handful of plain wheat thin crackers . the last thing i drank was ice water .","86936":"i ve never been glamping but it looks great","86937":"supposedly , but people refuse anyway and businesses aren t enforcing in all cases . for instance my regular grocery store enforces and everyone has a mask but the second closest grocery doesn t so it s a madhouse there .","86938":"i literally just got off a zoom meeting with my psychiatrist . it s stressing me out big time . panic disorder is no longer in remission , and i m having to increase my dosage of beta blocker . so that
