Idk why she wanted to be just friends and kept saying we should stop talking if we won't be something serious because she doesn't know the future. I told her I will never stop with the romantic and sxxual talk because I love her. And that was a couple days ago. Today she ended things with me because she said she wasn't getting anything beneficial from the relationship anymore and we want two different things. I feel like she played with my head and I'm angry and annoyed about it. Any advice ? Do you think she was wrong?\n  \n  --\n  \n  i don't believe she was wrong, and honestly, you insisting that you want to keep talking dirty to her despite her telling you not to is extremely selfish and disrespectful. you should not have done that.\n  \n  people are allowed to change their feelings towards others, and i understand that it hurt you, but you have to respect her feelings and what she says.\n  ","386143":"\n  \"if you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n  ","386144":"\n  yeah, but i honestly have no idea what the websites are, rofl. whenever i'm making a purchase online, i usually just search \"x coupons 2020\" and see what pops up. sometimes the promo codes work, sometimes they don't.\n  ","386145":"\n  only when i'm alone in the car & i'm listening to music.\n  ","386146":"\n  i can't really think of anything because i've barely been eating these days.\n  ","386147":"\n  yeah, i'm claustrophobic & enclosed spaces freak me out a lot. especially if it's in a public place, i get very panicked.\n  ","386148":"\n  i'm not superstituous at all.\n  ","386149":"\n  nah, clowns don't scare me.\n  ","386150":"\n  there was one time i woke up from a sound sleep at around 4:00am, and i heard footsteps walking down the hallway. it creeped me out so much.\n  \n  a week or so later, i was talking to my roommate and apparently he woke up at the same time & heard the same exact thing as i did. lmao.\n  ","386151":"\n  i'd notice it initially, but i wouldn't remember it.\n  ","386152":"\n  i've never paid much attention.\n  ","386153":"\n  no, i prefer rural environments.\n  ","386154":"\n  i don't give out my instagram.\n  ","386155":"\n  probably skyrim, as usual.

the order was completed and the driver's information was gone. from my understanding, you can only contact the driver when they're assigned to your order, and that information disappears when the order is completed.\n  ","386178":"\n  in an ideal world, it would be perfectly okay and encouraged to be truthful about mental illnesses. i advocate for erasing the stigma against mental illness, because there's so much that exists that it's sometimes unsafe for people to reveal their illness.\n  \n  so it's obviously okay to tell someone you're mentally ill, as long as it doesn't put you in a position of harm.\n  ","386179":"\n  favorite \u2014 cookie dough.\n  \n  least favorite \u2014 strawberry or chocolate.\n  ","386180":"\n  writing.\n  ","386181":"\n  i mean, that seems like an awful lot of work to do in order to get a partner who doesn't even like the genuine you. you can't keep up the facade forever, which is why it's most important to simply be yourself.\n  ","386182":"\n  the driver should have called doordash & said that he accidentally gave the order to someone else so that the restaurant can remake it. that way he would have picked it up fresh and delivered it to the other house faster instead of circling back around to me and asking me for the food back.\n  ","386183":"\n  hello \u2014 do you have a question?\n  ","386184":"\n  perhaps it would be the most decent thing a person can do, but i guarantee you that most people would not do that and would have just kept the food like i did.\n  \n  either way, him saying he should charge me for the food was wrong. that isn't even his decision to make.\n  ","386185":"\n  he was going to take the bag back \u2014 that would have cost him his job because of cross contamination.\n  ","386186":"\n  uh, one of those is a gender and the other is a sexual orientation.\n  \n  i'm non-binary and bisexual.\n  ","386187":"\n  exactly. like listen dude it isn't my fault you gave me both bags, i didn't know any better \u2014 i thought my order was in two bags. get the fuck outta here.\n  ","386188":"\n  i just ordered taco bell off of doordash.\n  \n  the dude gave me 2 bags and i didn't think anyone of it. after i went inside i realized he gave me not only my bag but someone else's bag. i shrugged and gave the second bag to my roommate.\n  \n  20 minutes later, the doordash driver rings me doorbell again. he asked if i had any food that wasn't ours and i said \"there was some stuff we didn't order but my roommate ate it and the rest is in the fridge.\" and the doordash driver goes \"well i'mma have to charge you for that.\" so i say \"listen it wasn't my fault you brought both bags to my front door.\" and he immediately leaves.\n  \n  like... wtf. lmao.\n  ","386189":"\n  just be yourself.\n  ","386190":"\n  l ; lost.\n  \n  e ; enthusiastic.\n  \n  i ; irritable.\n  \n  g ; gluttonous.\n  \n  h ; haphazard.\n  ","386191":"\n  idk about the whole \"loser\" part, but sometimes the best option is just to go for it. the worst that can happen is that they reject you, and then you can move on with that closure.\n  ","386192":"\n  i mean, i haven't been in school in seven years. so idk.\n  ","386193":"\n  i used to do that obsessively.\n  ","386194":"\n  it isn't cold. sorry if i don't support p*dophiles, r*pists, racists, etc etc.\n  ","386195":"\n  i want two mikes harder lemonades, but that requires me to walk across four lanes of traffic & that probably wouldn't work out well for me rn.\n  ","386196":"\n  a person simply being friends with someone else & indicating that they just want to be friends isn't a bad thing and isn't \"oppressive\" towards people (usually men) who want something more.\n  \n  the friendzone is a joke. just get over it.\n  ","386197":"\n  i honestly don't remember, i've had so many accounts.\n  ","386198":"\n  how can i love a god if i don't believe in a god?\n  ","386199":"\n  i've never gone far enough with someone to be friendzoned, lmao not like that even exists anyway.\n  ","386200":"\n  my mental illnesses are chronic, they're just managed for the most part by medication & therapy.\n  ","386201":"\n  it was twice today, i'm aware of that, rofl.\n  ","386202":"\n  well yeah, idk what the zodiac signs even mean so.\n  ","386203":"\n  LOL. i don't think it's weird or flirting. god forbid someone compliments someone else.\n  ","386204":"\n  perhaps. not everyone is the same, though.\n  ","386205":"\n  and this matters to me... why?\n  ","386206":"\n  aw !! thank you so much. :'))\n  \n  i follow you & i love your answers, i hope you have a nice rest of your evening as well.\n  ","386207":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","386208":"\n  it's been a relaxing day. i slept in until like 9:30am, went on my computer for a few hours, had some caffeine and watched youtube, did laundry, and now i'm watching movies and answering questions.\n  ","386209":"\n  wut. this has nothing to do with the current conversation?
