cooking breakfast , haha . i got an iced coffee and an egg sandwich . then i also got some donuts for the house if any of my roommates wanted any .","276623":"well , calling someone my girlfriend and then calling them my hookup are two different things , lol . i don t have any intentions on dating her . i don t remember who made the first move , it just sorta happened mutually . i m not getting into details regarding the exchange , however .","276624":"my inbox has been rather active today . i ve deactivated in the past , but not in the past few years . i don t have any intentions of deleting my account right now .","276625":"i m single .","276626":"listening to music , scrolling through social media , and answering questions .","276627":"depends on my mood , haha . i like them all , but some nights i have a preference for one over the other . i also like middle eastern food , which i haven t ordered in quite a while .","276628":"i think it would be lovely to visit england . i ve always wanted to go to london .","276629":"spanish would be most likely . i don t really have any absolute intentions to learn a new language rn , though .","276630":"starfield isn t even supposed to come out until after the next generation of consoles comes out , so that ll probably be at the end of . then elder scrolls vi will debut after that , which likely won t be for another years from then .","276631":"spanish , italian , and russian . i think it would be beneficial to learn spanish , and italian and russian both seem like beautiful languages .","276632":"that would be incredibly difficult , lol . they re all different games , so it would hard to rank them on the same scale . i love them all for different reasons .","276633":"i honestly don t remember , lol . i start playing games and then never end up finishing them because another game always catches my eye . i got pretty far into far cry until i got distracted , and then i only played maybe hours into red dead redemption before i got distracted again . lately , i ve been replaying fallout new vegas and skyrim , and then i also play minecraft and destiny with friends .","276634":"elder scrolls v skyrim , fallout , assassin s creed syndicate , bioshock infinite , and destiny .","276635":"lol , i agree ! ! i haven t looked into game development or anything if there s any news at all . although the fact that bethesda is coming out with starfield kinda makes me salty , lol . i understand they want to continue making games , but damn i want elder scrolls vi to be talked about again .","276636":"anyone have any questions ? i m bored","276637":"i ve never watched skins before , actually . i think i would enjoy it , though .","276638":"yeah , that s technically considered brain fog . i wouldn t be too concerned about it unless it starts happening very often .","276639":"i m five feet tall .","276640":"i ve never purchased an apple product before , lol . my ex gifted me an ipad a very long time ago , though .","276641":"i have an android phone .","276642":"i have it on my snapchat . it s at the very end of the filters list .","276643":"i did , but i deleted it because i don t know which photo i like better .","276644":"i was euphoric last night honestly , i think i was hypomanic because i was drinking and listening to great music and just living in the moment .","276645":"it s the unfortunate truth . although there are some people who take advantage of their own circumstances and make a better life for themselves outside of their families it s entirely possible given you have the resources necessary to succeed .","276646":"i somewhat agree with you , but it isn t only in big cities it s pretty much everywhere at least in the united states . most people live paycheck to paycheck , saving up enough money to pay for rent mortgage , groceries , and bills , alongside any other debts they have which can include credit card payments or car payments , car insurance , etc etc . it would be nice to have enough money saved up to take vacations often and see the world , but that isn t a reality for a lot of people .","276647":"fixing the state of the world when the older generations have come to pass .","276648":"it entirely depends on how much money you have to sustain yourself . it s much harder to immigrate to the united states now than it used to be in the past , and job opportunities are scarce unless you re thinking of becoming some sort of physician or scientist . it s ultimately your decision . i understand having the american dream , but life in the united states isn t as glamorous as what they make it out to be in the movies .","276649":"nah , it doesn t concern me .","276650":"it doesn t mean much to me at all . they re planning on selling the house anyway .","276651":"i m being serious in that it s expensive to live in new york , particularly if you believe you re going to live in the city or any of the boroughs or long island . i rent a house with two roommates because it was the cheapest option available for us all , and single bedroom apartments on long island in particular are upwards of per month . it s even more expensive in manhattan . most people work jobs or more to sustain themselves , so if you really want to live in new york , you re going to need a definitive plan and crunch a tight budget .","276652":"these are questions to which i have no answers .","276653":"don t do it , lol . new york is ridiculously expensive , and more more people are moving out of new york to live in states where it s cheaper to live .","276654":"yes , i rent a house with two roommates . my parents bought a house and are paying a mortgage .","276655":"yes , and i ve purchased some before ! ! peach vodka is pretty good i bought the absolut brand .","276656":"it does both for me depending on my mood when i ve started drinking . i either spiral or i become euphoric . last night , for example , i was in a great mood while drinking because i was already feeling content , and i was also listening to great music which further stimulated me .","276657":"why would you assume that ? lmaoo . if he had doubts or felt threatened , he s forthcoming enough to confront me about his feelings . he s a very casual person with no filter and during our relationship , he was very aware of how devoted i was to him . it s silly to try to judge a relationship based on the little knowledge you have of it . we were together for nearly years if he had doubts , we wouldn t have lasted as long as we did .","276658":"no , i never had a crush on her . we ve always just been close friends . he s always been good at guessing certain things , it s just part of who he is .","276659":"no , i ve never cheated in a relationship before . i dated a girl before when i was younger , and pretty much all of my crushes prior to dating my ex were on girls , lol .","276660":"i literally just said i had no desire to try harder drugs , lol .","276661":"okay , so i took one of those astrology tests not sure how reliable it is . apparently my sun is in scorpio , moon is aries , and ascendant is sagittarius . no clue what any of that means though , lmao .","276662":"i agree . that s why i ve had no desire to try other drugs besides the few times i ve tried cocaine when i was much younger .","276663":"yup , exactly . salvia , for example , is a hallucinogenic type of strain of weed . i ve only ever smoked it once when i was a teenager , and it was absolutely horrible for me . i like body highs as opposed to head highs , because when i get a head high , i tend to get more anxiety and get tunnel vision and i feel like i m spiraling . the second i get one of those highs , all i want to do is be sober again .","276664":"it s all right , i m comfortable answering it . she s never sought treatment or been professionally diagnosed , and she doesn t believe she s mentally ill either . however , i do think she is mentally ill to some capacity i just don t know to what extent , or what she could have . she would never admit to anything and even goes so far as to call me and my father crazy because we both take medication for mental illness .","276665":"depends on the strain . i prefer indica strains because that does reduce my anxiety , but sativa does the complete opposite .","276666":"yeah , i have facebook , instagram , twitter , and snapchat .","276667":"i feel as if i have no other choice , so probably . even though i m not the biggest fan of biden , he s the only logical choice because i do want trump out of office . voting third party is useless and will only divide the democratic vote .","276668":"uh , yeah . lmaoo . unless you re talking about the club , which refers to the musicians who have passed away at the age of . in that case , my answer would be janis joplin .","276669":"i ve never heard of that group before .","276670":"very rarely . i ll smoke maybe once every month or two months or so . i m a light weight , so only one hit will get me blazed for at least hours , haha . it also puts me into a deep sleep , so i don t smoke if i have work the next morning .","276671":"time will only tell . i ve moved on somewhat over the course of the past few months . i ve just been focusing on myself my work , my friends , my own mental health , what i ve been doing for fun , etc etc .","276672":"yeah , on more occasions than i can count . lmao .","276673":"my roommate is the same way , he just has short hair all over . he put the clippers on like a or a i think ? , and shaved all the way around . i had to help him do the back of his head neck , and i was so afraid to screw it up , even though the clippers were set on that specific length , lol .","276674":"my thing is , not all of my hair is shaved only half of my hair is shaved on the one side , and then i have an undercut on the other side and also hair shaved in the back up to a certain point . it would be easier if my entire head was shaved , but it isn t . that s why i m so nervous to do it myself , haha .","276675":"i used regular scissors once to cut my own hair when i was a teenager , lol . otherwise , no . i ve never cut my own hair before .","276676":"definitely not , lol . i would be way too anxious to try to shave my own head , especially considering i can t see the back or anything . i ve always had someone else do it for me .","276677":"pubmed central pmc is a free full text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the u . s . national institutes of health s national library of medicine .","276678":"yes , i have a stapler on my desk .","276679":"that is an acronym that can refer to several different things .","276680":"yeah , they were a basic boy band of the s , much like the s had nsync and the backstreet boys .","276681":"yeah , i ve heard of them . i didn t listen to their music because they were a bit before my time , though .","276682":"no , i know absolutely nothing about them .","276683":"i don t own a gun .","276684":"it depends on which town you go to in order to take the driving test , because for some reasons different areas are more lenient than others . i failed my driving test on the first try , but passed it on the second try .","276685":"it could be an indication of that , yeah . however , i don t know your relationship so obviously i can t give you a definitive answer . that s something you would have to talk about thoroughly with him .","276686":"oh wow , that s great . i ll definitely have to look into that .","276687":"the only thing that comes to mind is as it applies to something that s behind something else , i . e . a dog s hind legs .","276688":"no , i just have a regular teapot for the stove .","276689":"i don t personally think that s cheating , no . but everyone has a different idea of what cheating entails , so some people could consider that cheating in a relationship or at least a red flag .","276690":"unfortunately , i don t have a library card , lol . but that s interesting ! i think i used to have a library card from the old town i lived in even though i hadn t used it since high school . i haven t visited the library for the town i live in now , though , since covid happened .","276691":"not at all . let me know if you buy it , and if you read it , what you think .","276692":"i get my yearly inspection done , and then i get oil changes every months . during those times , they check out the car and replace whatever else is necessary .","276693":"my ex ordered it for me off of my amazon wishlist last year . i just checked amazon again , and it s only .","276694":"this is the book . i recommend it ! i m only maybe through it , but it really has opened my eyes a lot .","276695":"i have no clue . i m pretty sure my mechanic changed it last year when i went for my inspection , though .","276696":"oh man , i honestly can t remember . lol . i have no problem with starting books , but finishing them is a completely different story . the last book i started reading but didn t finish yet is a self help book regarding toxic parents and how to overcome the difficult feelings you have when you ve been raised in a toxic or ab sive environment . the first half of the book is dedicated to explaining the different types of toxic parents and their traits , with case studies from the author who s a psychologist , and the second half discusses different coping mechanisms and methods to overcome their hurt and power over you to reclaim your life .","276697":"i don t have one , lol . i m not into cars at all .","276698":"this is a similar question to what i just answered see below . but it s something i have talked about with my best friend , my ex , and my therapist . we re all in agreement that i should cut her out of my because she s done nothing but give me ab se and hell for as long as i can remember . i thought moving out and having my own place would calm things down , but now she s scrambling to have some semblance of control over my life still . i wouldn t want to cut my father out of the picture completely , so when i saw my ex yesterday , he recommended that i talk to my father on the side without my mother knowing because i do respect my father and want to maintain somewhat of a relationship with him .","276699":"it s complicated , like most family relations are . i am slowly distancing myself from her for example , prior to that text from friday , we had not talked since the previous wednesday . i think she already understands that i want to distance myself because other family members have done that to her already , i just don t know how to bring it up in conversation without her deflecting blame or freaking out .","276700":"my mother yesterday . she texted me some bullsh t as usual .","276701":"why would he ? he s dating someone else , and he wants what s best for me .","276702":"nah , he was happy for me .","276703":"i don t really think i m unique in any manner , lol .","276704":"i took it before going outside to have a campfire with my roommate and his family , so i was in a good mood . lol .","276705":"this is my most recent selfie from a few days ago .","276706":"we were together for nearly years .","276707":"i miss some of my friends whom i haven t seen in a while . i m hoping to meet up with one of my old coworkers soon , though . we ve texted often , but i haven t seen her since mid march .","276708":"me too , tbh . he s a great person . i do still love him to some extent , and i don t believe that ll ever go completely away . but i know i can t keep holding onto the thought that we d get back together because that consumed me for a long time . relationships are complicated . i m just happy he still wants to be my friend , because we do have an excellent friendship and i would never trade that for anything .","276709":"lol . i ve always identified as bisexual well , there was a brief time i identified as pansexual , but i ll be honest i don t really see much a difference between the two . but in truth , whoever i like is whoever i like . i ve never had a distinct type based on the people i ve crushed on prior to entering my last relationship . my ex also called it , lmaoo . after we broke up , he said i guarantee the next person you see will be a woman , and i was all , yeah okay lol . then when i saw him today and told him , he laughed hysterically . then i told him her name , and he started laughing even harder and said , i f cking knew it would be her . smh , he knows me too well .","276710":"i ve always believed that sexuality is fluid , and someone isn t less valid if they date or hook up with someone that s outside of their sexuality . people will follow their hearts and do what feels right to them , and there s nothing wrong with that .","276711":"i don t post photos of my friends on askfm , but they re my best friend , my ex , two close friends of mine , and my roommate .","276712":"no , i respect other people s privacy .","276713":"i agree with you , i got the same impression from them as well . smh . at least now anons can stop questioning my bisexuality because previously , i had never had s x with a woman before and they claimed i wasn t actually bi because i never actually had s x with a woman . lmao . along the same lines as that when i saw my ex today , i said something along the lines of well that confirms i m totally bi then , and he was like dude , you re not bi , you re gay . you ve liked women and i was the only exception to that basically . and after i thought about it . . . he s right . lmao . all of my previous crushes were on girls when i was in high school . i had dated one man during high school , but he groomed me so it was different .","276714":"no , lol . i know she doesn t because none of my irl friends use askfm .","276715":"she doesn t use askfm , lmao .","276716":"lmaoo . i m not getting into details regarding what happened .","276717":"all my life , i was afraid to die , but now i come alive inside these flames . the fighter by in this moment .","276718":"i ve grown to become more of a morning person than anything else over the past few years , tbh . i used to be a night owl back in high school and college , but ever since i started working jobs that were , i ve become accustomed to waking up early in the morning .","276719":"it s currently pm in new york .","276720":"i don t have feelings for courtney , lol . she s just a friend , and she s currently dating her boyfriend in another state . the woman i hooked up with has no connection with courtney whatsoever . she s someone i ve been friends with since high school .","276721":"nothing , tbh . i just dwell on it and try to push it aside because my coping mechanisms are terrible .","276722":"no , courtneyuwu and i have never had any sort of romantic s xual interaction . we re purely friends , lol .","276723":"not really , at least not in romantic relationships . i ve felt unimportant in friendships on plenty of occasions , though . i have the tendency to think that i m putting more into the friendship than the other person , and that they re only putting up with me because they feel sorry for me or something .","276724":"lol , no we didn t hook up . i was just saying that the only people i ve ever met from online have been online friends .","276725":"i agree with you ! ! i think a lot of companies are probably re evaluating their remote work policies and crunching the numbers to see if it s better for employees to work from home versus working in the office . it s been virtually the same with my job , even the meetings we have are over zoom instead of emailing back and forth , so we still can see everyone s faces .","276726":"i ve never met someone online besides , like . . . online friends from the past , like courtneyuwu . the woman i hooked up with has been a friend of mine since high school , lol . it was honestly fun , and i wouldn t say no if she wanted to hook up again . it was a no strings attached sort of thing .","276727":"to be totally honest with you , i really hope we don t return to the office . i ve become so comfortable working from home and i feel x more productive doing so , and the thought of returning to the office gives me major anxiety .","276728":"i joined tinder a while ago , but i feel apprehensive about actually meeting up with people and going out on dates . granted i did hook up with someone last weekend , but it was a very unexpected and spontaneous decision , lmaoo .","276729":"they re equally important to me , it would be impossible to pit them against each other because i consider both of them my closest friends .","276730":"lol . i can definitely understand that . everyone in my company works their own projects , we don t really have any team building activities . the majority of our communication has always been through email anyway , so working from home isn t much different at all than working in the office .","276731":"it probably has something to do with the lack of control the company has over the employee working from home , and concern about productivity . which i somewhat understand , but i also agree with you that working from home should be more socially accepted and practiced . in the case of my job , people are actually being more productive because they can just easily log on and check their emails even outside of work hours just to keep up with things . i m actually thinking about logging in for about minutes later , just to check my email and flag things accordingly .","276732":"i honestly have no clue , haha . he s just been such an important and central figure in my life from the time i was years old . he s helped me survive through all of the hardships i ve faced , and i ve done the same for him regarding his own hardships and pitfalls .","276733":"hi friends , i m home alone for the rest of the night , so ask me some questions","276734":"working from home has been amazing , tbh . i love the fact that i don t have to rush in the morning , i don t have to deal with the daily hour long commute going there and back home , and i enjoy being able to do household chores and errands here and there while i m on my breaks . i don t miss the social aspect of work at all , because i remain in contact with the coworkers who i did talk to on a daily basis . obviously we haven t seen each other since quarantine started , but we do have loose plans to eventually see each other soon .","276735":"honestly , probably not . it will hurt a bit , of course , but i can t imagine him not in my life in some capacity . if it were to come to that , i would be forthcoming about my feelings about it and make sure he knows how much it hurt me . i wouldn t ignore my feelings like i have in the past just to keep the relationship going .","276736":"haha , thank you . i ve definitely learned a lot about myself since we broke up , especially regarding my own resilience . although it does help a lot that him and i are still good friends .","276737":"if he did , that s just a further motive for me to tell him no if he ends up breaking up with his girlfriend and desires to get back together with me . he needs to learn how to be alone .","276738":"i don t believe i m in love with him like i was , but i still do love him . there will probably always be a part of me who loves him .","276739":"i don t know if he actually cheated on me he just liked her . it wouldn t surprise me if he did , though . he never admitted to it , so it might be a conversation we should have in the future . i think he jumps from one person to another because it s all he s ever known , and i think it does stem from his own past and his addiction to s x due to his own trauma . he s very hypers xual and always has been for as long as i ve known him .","276740":"i m usually open to talk about anything , depending on how well i know that person . however , if it s someone i m meeting for the first time , i generally don t talk about political views with them first . those conversations can wait until we re better acquainted .","276741":"he was , but he obviously had faults of his own that he needed to work on that i either ignored or was in denial of until the past few months after talking it through with friends . i did find out that he had liked his current girlfriend while him and i were still dating , which explains why him and i were so distant towards the end of the relationship . i had known who she was at that time , but i didn t think anything of it . he s always jumped from one person to another , and i think he needs some time to be single if his current relationship doesn t work out to sort through his own feelings , and also focus on himself . i think he would benefit from therapy too .","276742":"no , probably not . i used to want with every ounce of my being to get back together with him , but over the course of the past few months , i ve realized that even if he and his girlfriend broke up and he asked me out again , i would say no . he has a lot of self realization to do , a lot of things to work on himself , and he would need some time for himself and be single before he jumps into another relationship . he s never been out of a relationship for very long , which means he has had little time being single for pretty much since he was a young teenager . i think he would need time like that to collect himself and find what he truly values in a relationship and in life .","276743":"illuminating . i went to my ex s apartment and we talked about a lot of different things , and it felt nice to catch up and also get some things off my chest that i had been holding in for a while .","276744":"fact my laptop lock home screens are prettier than most .","276745":"myself , lol . i don t remember a large portion of my life , so i would want to glimpse into my own past and see what had happened .","276746":"i wish i was skilled at singing . had i been a good singer , i would have entered the music industry a long time ago .","276747":"forensic files , criminal minds , or pretty much any show that s a true crime documentary .","276748":"i don t really have any plans or goals , no . i ve been trying to take each day as it comes since quarantine started because if i think too far ahead , then i get overwhelmed and or disappointed .","276749":"i used to call out of work a lot when i had to commute to the office , but ever since i ve been working from home , i haven t been out as often . i clocked out early from work two ish weeks ago because i wasn t mentally feeling well , but prior to that , it was at least one or two months since i had either clocked out early or called out completely .","276750":"cont . . . it s things like this that makes me regret and wish i never got help because if i never got diagnosed probably i would still seem normal and wouldn t have to declare shit even if i was mentally ill . the processes would be so much easier and i don t have to worry if i m going to get turned away . i could not even muster the courage to ask the person uh , i actually also have bpd . would i still be able to donate blood ? because i was afraid of the answer and i was afraid i would get blacklisted . sigh i might be overthinking i don t believe you re overthinking at all , tbh i would probably wonder the same thing myself if i were to ever donate blood or anything which honestly , i ve never done before . i haven t even been to a regular doctor in years , lol . i think if you re able to show that you re mentally okay enough to consent like if you re in treatment or anything then it shouldn t be a problem . i m beginning to wonder if it s also relevant to a survey as well like they want to know how many people diagnosed with depression anxiety donate blood compared to people without mental illnesses .","276751":"that doesn t sound . . . legal ? i m really unfamiliar with the entire process of donating blood , though , so i m not entirely sure . that definitely doesn t sound right to me , though . i m so sorry you re going through this . jobs and schools shouldn t be discriminating against you for having mental illnesses either . like , my job knows i have depression and anxiety because i have a doctor s note on file excusing me from absences in light of my illnesses , but thankfully they ve never held it against me before .","276752":"i haven t painted in a while , but yes i do enjoy painting .","276753":"i was a bit irritated the other day when my roommate s family came over and they were talking really loudly in the living room while i was trying to work . it wasn t necessarily their fault , it s not as if they were purposely being loud it s just who they are . i also didn t want to close my bedroom door because then i wouldn t have had the air conditioning coming into the room . it was just a mild annoyance .","276754":"i ve never even heard of that before , tbh . that s really shocking and surprising to me why would they turn you away for having a mental illness ? how would they even be able to tell if you re mentally ill to begin with ?","276755":"i ve always been pretty good at spelling , yes .","276756":"i only have two stuffed animals , haha . i keep them on my bed they re not big or anything .","276757":"i always enjoyed my english classes , which is why i majored in english and writing when i was in college .","276758":"i just get lethargic in the hot , humid weather . i don t want to do anything that exerts energy .","276759":"i saw it last week , i think ! ! it looks super intense .","276760":"facebook ! ! i uploaded a video of me wearing a skyrim mask that my friend mailed to me .","276761":"yes , i use paypal .","276762":"i use askfm , twitter , instagram , snapchat , and facebook .","276763":"i m currently drinking an espresso martini and watching the television series the punisher on netflix .","276764":"yes , i have notifications turned on for all social media apps on my phone .","276765":"my inbox is nearly empty the rest of the questions in my inbox are simple spam questions from friends . y all , send me some interesting questions for the rest of the night","276766":"cheeseburgers , but not just any cheeseburger one from a local diner , where it s freshly made on a huge bun with fresh lettuce and tomatoes . cheeseburgers from fast food restaurants are an insult to actual cheeseburgers .","276767":"i would choose to have the ability to sing well . if i wasn t a writer or creative person in general , then i would have gone into the music industry if i had a terrific singing voice .","276768":"there have been so many strange things said to me on the internet over the years , that i wouldn t honestly know where to begin , lol . it s mostly been on askfm , not surprisingly .","276769":"my ex , lmaoo . i don t know if he s changed ever since we broke up in regards to his cleanliness i . e . he used to leave plates and cups everywhere , but i m sorta happy we didn t get a chance to move in together during the latter stages of our relationship . i ve realized i m somewhat of a clean freak ever since i moved into my own house , and his lack of attention to keeping things tidy would drive me wild .","276770":"i m so sorry that has happened to you and that other people feel the need to judge you for how you re coping with the aftermath of it . they have no say in how you should think , act , or feel , and you re doing the best you can do while overcoming the

a red flag , lol . that s a green flag more than anything else . if you ve been with your partner for a while and they still give you butterflies , i think that s a really cute thing . it means you re still enamored with them after all this time .","276889":"this is something i ve struggled with for the majority of my life . i find it difficult to really find meaning in most things , and it s the little things in life that keep me somewhat motivated .","276890":"i d rather not get into that .","276891":"marijuana , mainly . anything else , i think is dangerous .","276892":"occasionally , i

friends","276913":"oh goodness . pretend you re confronting a total stranger on the street . would you ask them this same question ? the answer is no . it isn t an acceptable or appropriate question to ask a person .","276914":"hypotheticals are pointless .","276915":"no , that isn t the only thing that matters . if you cheat on your partner , you clearly have zero respect for them or their feelings , because you know they re going to feel hurt and heartbroken over it . if you re interesting in pursuing someone else , the right thing to do would be to end the relationship and start the new fling or whatever it is as a single person .","276916":"definitely not , lmaoo . it s one of my closest friends whom i ve known for years and his brother .","276917":"yeah , that s what i m thinking too . it s a small increase that doesn t really mean much , but it was still a really random number so he s going to call tomorrow regardless .","276918":"believe it or not , people of different sexes and genders can live with each other if they have a mutual respect for one another and are adults with responsible attitudes .","276919":"? ? ? well yeah , if you don t have a uterus then you obviously can t carry a pregnancy . but in the case of trans women dating cis women or trans men dating cis men or anything other person who has male genitalia , they can most certainly get pregnant . to assume that you automatically can t reproduce if you re a trans person is just silly . there are plenty of trans and non binary people who become pregnant and bring a term to labor .","276920":"i agree with you . some people simply cannot respect others though , which is fine if people don t respect me i m not here for respect or validation , and i don t expect it from everyone obviously either , that would just be unrealistic .","276921":"you re referring to sex then , not gender . even still , sex is based on chromosomes and that can vary wildly as well . gender isn t the same as sex , so if you re afab but your gender is a man , then you re a man . there s no disputing that , regardless of how you want to spin it . also . . . trans people can most absolutely reproduce , lmfao what .","276922":"it s an inconvenience , but nothing any of us can t handle . it just seems so random i honestly think the house is overpriced to begin with . but my roommate was comparing the new rent we d be paying come october with other places in the area what we pay is still cheaper than most other houses for rent , so we think the increase is due to the market itself .","276923":"i already told you my gender .","276924":"i beg to differ . i m not really in the mood to have a discussion regarding gender right now , though . if you re curious about non binary identities , you can easily google it .","276925":"i m non binary .","276926":"yes , they re two men .","276927":"that s precisely why i distanced myself from the feminist community , lol . if i still believe in the fight for equality and taking back empowerment , then i really don t see the issue here .","276928":"if you don t have anything productive to add to this discussion , i m just going to delete any further inquiries .","276929":"thanks for using my pronouns .","276930":"i have two roommates .","276931":"no , i m single .","276932":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","276933":"hello do you have a question ?","276934":"i m listening to music drinking at the moment . i m a bit angry because the property manager increased our rent for when we renew the lease , and they didn t explain why . so my roommate is going to call their office tomorrow and see what s going on .","276935":"be unapologetically yourself , regardless of the hard time people give you for simply expressing yourself . you know yourself better than anyone else , and if someone doesn t accept you for who you are , they re not worth having around in your life .","276936":"this is going to sound weird , but my ex . even though we broke up almost a year ago , i can t deny the fact that he s helped me through some of the most difficult moments of my life .","276937":"yes , although i probably shouldn t hold those moments dear to me anymore .","276938":"sounds like you have some unresolved issues you need to work through if you re that offended by the fact that i don t want to put myself under a label . i still have the same beliefs , so it really doesn t make a difference whether or not i ascribe to the feminist label . i obviously still believe that we have a patriarchal society that caters to cishet white men .","276939":"those were storm clouds , but i guess they passed us , ugh . i was really hoping for a thunderstorm tonight to get rid of this damn humidity .","276940":"any risk where the pros of taking on the risk outweigh the cons .","276941":"when my internet decides to cut down in the middle of the work day , sigh . it hasn t happened in a few days , but it used to happen frequently in the past .","276942":"i ve considered changing my dead name into the name i go by now , but it seems like an awful lot of effort for me because hardly anyone calls me by my dead name anymore . it s only on legal documents , which doesn t really bother me .","276943":"it hasn t personally affected me because i haven t done anything different since the lockdown began , lol . i ve only gone out to eat once and it was outdoor dining with tables several feet apart , and there were two other couples there , so i felt comfortable . last friday , i actually did try to go to the bar since they ve been doing outdoor seating with table service for a few weeks now , and it was an interesting experience . i don t think i d go back though , there were more people there and i was incredibly paranoid .","276944":"i m all for it just because you don t know someone well doesn t mean they don t deserve or need words of encouragement . if someone came to me asking for advice or comfort , i d try my best to help .","276945":"i ve always thought the legends were really interesting , and there s definitely gotta be some sort of magnetic field disruption there or something .","276946":"nothing . it s always disgustingly hot and humid , which takes the fun out of any summer activity .","276947":"i said i was unaware of the circumstance , not that i refused to look into it my answer is only a few answers down . thereafter , i suggested that you can raise awareness yourself of this dilemma , considering you also have a social media platform . this doesn t mean that i don t care about issues outside of my own country . i merely stated that i was unaware of the situation .","276948":"? ? ? where have i ever said that i don t want to support movements in other countries ? lol .","276949":"usually when i m under the influence of some sort of substance .","276950":"i don t know anything about that . you can raise awareness yourself , though .","276951":"some may consider me to be so , yes .","276952":"i can t guarantee that i can help you , but i ll hear you out .","276953":"one of the cats crawling on top of my bed to lay down next to me .","276954":"the connections you make with other people in order to cultivate a strong support system for yourself and others .","276955":"i used to be deeply involved in feminism years ago intersectional at least , and that s where i realized that a lot of feminists were actually white feminists and derivatives of that . if i were to get back into feminism , i would be more apt to look into radical feminism , i . e . from the s to s when a lot of actual progress was made .","276956":"thanks , i try my best .","276957":"i wish the united states had the same policy for people like delivery drivers and waiters , sigh .","276958":"if you don t want to tip waiters or waitresses , then you shouldn t order food or go out to eat . they primarily live off of their tips because they make less than minimum wage .","276959":". . . why wouldn t you tip delivery drivers ?","276960":"i used to use pinterest years ago , but not recently .","276961":"i use debit more than anything else . i have cash on me usually , but i try to reserve that for tipping delivery drivers or paying my roommate back if we order food some days .","276962":"apparently everyone dreams , it s all a matter

make time to send them a quick text . it isn t about demanding attention , it s about being considerate to your partner .","276968":"the main reason i get out of bed in the morning is to have coffee and my morning dose of nicotine .","276969":"nah , i can always catch up later . as long as my partner doesn t insist on picking up where they left off instead of where we both left off , otherwise i d be losing part of the storyline and that can get confusing .","276970":"i m tired of interesting things happening , lmao . i d much rather have good things happen to me for a change .","276971":"i would prefer it , and in most cases there s really no excuse to not check in with your partner at least once per day even if it is a really brief text message . sending a text takes only a few seconds out of your day , and it could mean the world to your partner .","276972":"i used to go by the label of intersectional feminist , and while i do hold similar opinions to those i had in the past , i don t align myself with other feminists because i think the majority of the modern movement is a joke and most feminists focus on superficial things instead of focusing their attention on serious matters .","276973":"i feel like typical americans , or at least the stereotype of them , are white cishet men , gun toting , bible quoting , anti mask wearing , maga idiots which gives america a bad

pictures show how long my hair is right now .","276981":"i don t believe so , no . at least judging by my abundance of roots atm .","276982":"no , that couldn t be further from the truth .","276983":"i don t have any photos like that , and i m not going to take one .","276984":"no , journalism is more about interviewing people and writing articles for things like magazines and newspapers . it s a much different field .","276985":"that isn t a publishing company , and i said i wasn t a journalist , so no .","276986":"no , i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","276987":"i live in new york , so i wouldn t be surprised .","276988":"i m five feet tall .","276989":"this sounds like bait where i would ask you what news ? etc etc . however , i m currently watching the netflix series of the punisher and it s been a wild ride .","276990":"bravery has nothing to do with body modifications . i don t want face tattoos .","276991":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","276992":"i suppose from the neck up , haha .","276993":"no , it was the artist s design .","276994":"i prefer moonlight , although sunlight does put me in a good mood sometimes .","276995":", considering i have a coffee tattoo .","276996":"i ve already saved a lot of money by not going to starbucks every week , lol . i used to get it once to twice per week when i was commuting to the office for work , but since i ve been working from home , i normally just brew coffee in the kitchen instead of going out for coffee in the morning .","276997":"yeah , pretty much any time i buy an iced latte from starbucks .","276998":"favorite flower yellow roses . favorite season autumn .","276999":"sweeney todd , even though i ve watched it a million times before .","277000":"spanish , italian , and russian .","277001":"i don t believe it s a fault unless it s something that s preventing you from doing or achieving what you want in life .","277002":"eh , both ? it really depends on how i m feeling that day . some days i m rather impulsive and spontaneous , while other days i like planning ahead .","277003":"? ? ? why would i contemplate having sex with a person that wasn t attractive ? the fact that their face is covered doesn t make them any more or less attractive , lmao . they re still who they are .","277004":"i fell in love fairly quickly with my ex , haha . however , i haven t had much experience outside of that .","277005":"if you re questioning it in the first place , then that might be an indication that you don t love someone as much as you thought you did , or that the feelings you used to hold are slowly dwindling away .","277006":"i m pretty sure most everyone is of the general consensus that they wouldn t have sex with a person that they didn t find sexually attractive .","277007":"i don t play these stupid games .","277008":"no problem ! !","277009":"it was done right during the episodes i watched . i highly recommend it ! !","277010":"this is the synopsis on google based on the graphic novel of the same name , nick sax is a corrupt , intoxicated , ex cop turned hit man who is adrift in a twilight world of casual murder , soulless sex , and betrayal . after a hit goes wrong , nick finds a bullet in his side , the cops and the mob on his tail , and a monstrous killer on the loose . but his world is about to be changed forever by a tiny , imaginary , blue winged horse with a relentlessly positive attitude named happy . on their journey , they must contend with a laundry list of enemies including angry mobsters , ex mistresses , ex wives , and one very bad santa .","277011":"visit my best friend in new england , go on a bender , and spend the day evening talking and laughing and listening to music while sitting around a firepit .","277012":"my ex introduced me to the show happy ! on netflix , and i thought it was hilarious . it s a dark action series with hints of comedy . i never finished it , but the few episodes i watched were great .","277013":"i disagree , but the sentiment is appreciated .","277014":"oh , definitely not . lol .","277015":"i ve never eaten bugs before , except for the small worms that are in strawberries apparently .","277016":"i don t believe i have , no . i would be too afraid to hurt them , haha .","277017":"doing any of my hobbies , depending on my mood . lately it s been playing video games and catching up on some television shows .","277018":"it s still too warm for my liking during the spring , haha .","277019":"i just finished up , and she was really nice . i m going to continue with a follow up appointment next week .","277020":"i have my first appointment with a brand new therapist in minutes i m panicking , ugh . i don t know why this is giving me so much anxiety .","277021":"people simply don t want to look inwardly and realize that they have their own demons to confront , so they take their frustrations out on other people simply because they don t agree with their opinion lifestyle etc etc . it s silly , but it s the reality of the internet .","277022":"nah , i m perfectly fine with my instagram username being hidden . i appreciate your concern , though .","277023":"i don t block anyone on askfm . if you re not satisfied with my responses to your questions , you can choose to leave my page .","277024":"those social media accounts are solely dedicated for my friends , not for strangers on the internet .","277025":"i don t give any of those out all of my accounts are private .","277026":"facebook , twitter , instagram , and snapchat .","277027":"i don t think anything of relationships because i don t have an interest in dating at the moment .","277028":"i prefer autumn and winter because of the cooler temperatures . i can t handle the heat and humidity .","277029":"that s common , unfortunately even though it is indeed wrong . when you re posting sex work online like through onlyfans , you re consenting to that activity . nobody consents to getting harrassed on the street or even online , like what often happens to people on askfm too .","277030":"i enjoy playing video games , writing , reading , watching television , and painting .","277031":"ask me questions then . that s the purpose of askfm , lol .","277032":"yes , i am currently single .","277033":"no , i don t play pubg . i used to watch my ex play it , though .","277034":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","277035":"i ve only ever seen the first three i think ? saw movies , which was a very long time ago .","277036":"both of them .","277037":"the roads are never empty where i live , and i only drive when necessary .","277038":"no , i m a cautious driver because driving gives me major anxiety .","277039":"? ? ? you also overestimate my interest in pursuing friendships and relationships with other people , lmaoo .","277040":"you greatly overestimate how much effort i put into my appearance , lmao .","277041":"? ? ? why would that mean i would have to pick someone up or stay at their place when they re perfectly capable of coming to my house and staying here as well ? lmaoo . regardless , it wouldn t really matter to me . i grew up in a violent neighborhood so things like that don t phase me .","277042":"it would entirely depend upon the individual themselves , lol . you can t really class all people into the same sort of category just because they live in a poor neighborhood . everyone has different personalities .","277043":"i can understand the criticism coming from radical feminism , because i know a few people who are radical feminists who oppose onlyfans other forms of sex work . i don t know enough about the argument to really comment on it , though .","277044":"i m not interesting in dating right now .","277045":"yes , i have ! ! it was a funding effort for a movie made by rooster teeth years upon years ago called lazer team , and i donated a bit of money to the project .","277046":"i m not sure if there s another life form that s like humans , but i certainly believe in other life living somewhere in this universe .","277047":"no , i ve had ringing in my ears but it s never lasted very long .","277048":"misogyny , particularly internalized misogyny if it s coming from other women in most cases . women have been raised in environments where men have overruled them as part of this patriarchial society we live in , so every time a woman does something to advance herself or empower herself especially if it s sexual , it s seen as a threat to masculinity . even though we ve come far collectively in terms of equality , the sexism and misogyny is still very evident .","277049":"i took a few taekwondo classes as a kid , but i only advanced a few belts .","277050":"i don t have games on my phone .","277051":"everything is cake .","277052":"scrambled eggs , buttered toast , and bacon .","277053":"laying down because i m sweating my ass off after picking up my medication and being out in this degree weather .","277054":"i actually don t believe i have .","277055":"butter , most of the time . i ve also been obsessed with avocado toast , lol .","277056":"no , i don t clock out for another hours .","277057":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","277058":"lol . omg , i could never .","277059":"none . i m not religious .","277060":"i just want to feel happy with myself and my goals and my life in general , regardless of what type of journey that would entail .","277061":"i really like this one for some reason , even though it was from last year .","277062":"probably the future , just so the world could be past the chaos it s currently in . although tbh , i wouldn t want to be reborn into a new life anyway .","277063":"yes , although i don t believe i was ranting , rofl . but that s the idea i was essentially describing .","277064":"english , spanish , italian , and russian .","277065":"anyone else wanted to bite into one of these when they were a kid ? lmaoo .","277066":"the sunset last night was gorgeous .","277067":"no , i don t believe in fate or destiny , i just believe in coincidences and the domino effect .","277068":"i would be fine with not being remembered in general , but i would prefer to be remembered for years following my death for something good that i ve done .","277069":"no , i have absolutely zero august plans thanks to covid . otherwise , i would be getting a tattoo and getting my hair trimmed , shaved , and colored .","277070":"i usually use netflix and hulu to watch movies , depending on which streaming service has the movie or a similar movie that i m looking for . i also have amazon prime , but a lot of their movies don t stream for free , unfortunately .","277071":"i honestly don t remember . i don t dance very often at all , unless i m alone in my room grooving to music late at night , lol . i ve only ever gone to a club once in my life where there was dancing , and i hated it .","277072":"yes , i vote in every presidential election . i m not sure who exactly i m voting for yet because i don t support trump or biden , so i ll have to do more research .","277073":"i love looking at snow and find watching snowfall to be incredibly peaceful . however , it gives me horrible anxiety when i have to drive in it .","277074":"i usually save more than i spend , especially now during covid while i ve been working from home . i don t feel the need to spend money on energy drinks or breakfast outside of the house , for example , and i ve been cooking more .","277075":"i support onlyfans , although i ve never subscribed to any of my friends pages before . if it s something that works for them , they consent to everything , and it makes them happy , then there s no reason for me to pass judgment .","277076":"not exactly , no . i believe people become more mature as they gather experiences throughout their lives , and that is somewhat relative to age but not necessarily .","277077":"definitely not , lol . my singing voice is absolutely horrible .","277078":"i went to the grocery store last weekend to pick up food and other essentials , like paper towels and toilet paper and soap . i m going to the pharmacy on my lunch break today to pick up my medication .","277079":"why not both ? haha . ultimately , it depends on the person and what looks best on them . some people even look better freshly shaven or with stubble . i ve always been more attracted to people with beards mustaches though , for whatever reason .","277080":"it can be pronounced as lay or lee , at least that s how i pronounce it . most people use the latter pronunciation .","277081":"probably scrambled eggs with buttered toast , haha . it s one of my comfort foods .","277082":"iced coffee , margaritas , and a cd of my favorite music .","277083":"my nickname was lee in high school , and as i got older , it changed to what i go by as my actual name now , which is leigh .","277084":"i have no regrets ! ! it was fun and spontaneous , we re still just friends and nothing more will come of it because we both know it was just a casual fling . if it happens again , i d be willing to do so , but if it was just a one time thing , i m happy with that too .","277085":"yeah , she always has been unfortunately . she s the source of most of my trauma , and i thought that i would be escaping it by moving out , but her need for control has only become worse within the months i ve moved out because i m not physically around for her to control anymore .","277086":"yes , i ve used zoom on a few occasions to have happy hour hang outs with my coworkers .","277087":"i m doing fine at the moment . i woke up early this morning for some reason , so i decided to make avocado toast with fried eggs and coffee for breakfast . now i m just hanging out on askfm and answering questions in my inbox before i have to clock into work .","277088":"yes , i ve felt left out because of friends and family alike . it hasn t happened to me in a while with respect to my friends because i ve closed my inner circle , and i have a small group of trusted friends now . however , my family leaves me out and treats me so much differently on a regular basis .","277089":"abandonment by loved ones .","277090":"there s so much left to explore here on earth , especially with respect to the oceans . from my understanding , we only have the technology to really discover a small percentage of what the world s oceans entail , and it would be interesting to see what else is living here with us .","277091":"no , i ve never been afraid of heights . i ve always found it really exhilarating to be high up in the sky , whether it s in a plane or on top of a building .","277092":"i prefer cheetos , although cool ranch doritos come in a close second place .","277093":"i suppose a . i m not overly stressed , but i am very anxious about my therapy appointment tonight .","277094":"i m not going to be posting any video responses today . i have work for the following hours , and then i have a video appointment with a new therapist .","277095":"yes , i was sleeping when this message was sent .","277096":"yes , i want a lot more tattoos , haha .","277097":"yeah , haha . tattoos hurt like hell most of them anyway .","277098":"i don t have a photo , but i just ate a part of a chicken parm hero it was delicious . that can probably be considered one of my comfort foods .","277099":"i was angry with my parents over a long winded , disparaging text that my mother sent to me on friday . i m not willing to go into the details of the text message , but we went back and forth for a little while until i completely stopped answering her . she was essentially still treating me as if i was a child , degrading me , and trying to exert control over my life .","277100":"i don t have an iphone .","277101":"i grew up playing on xbox consoles , so having a playstation never really crossed my mind .","277102":"hi friends , ask me some questions","277103":"i prefer colder seasons , particularly autumn . i cannot stand the heat .","277104":"i think when you round up people of varying genders , it would be nearly impossible to come to a consensus regarding which gender cheats more in relationships . it all comes down to individual experiences .","277105":"thank you , kittie . your positive posts are delightful .","277106":"probably not , it s not something i ve ever looked into .","277107":"we re talking about vision , not amputation .","277108":"no , wearing glasses doesn t make you disabled , as long as the corrective lenses you wear makes your vision acceptable .","277109":"nope , i ve retained absolutely zero knowledge of the french language . lmao .","277110":"the united states doesn t have an official language , and there are a multitude of languages spoken in this country .","277111":"yes , spanish is commonly used throughout the united states . they offered spanish classes when i was in high school we were supposed to take one foreign language course , but i chose french for some unknown reason . it would have benefited me a lot more if i chose spanish .","277112":"not really , no . which is amusing considering my ex is cuban and his family speaks spanish fluently . i ve just never picked up on the language .","277113":"unless they learn how to take accountability for their actions , then it may get worse in the long haul . not apologizing for the mistakes you have made is not a good trait to have , and when things get more serious in your relationship , that type of behavior is going to spill over into other things , i . e . if you decide to move in together , get married , have a family , etc etc .","277114":"i ve always questioned it myself , lol . i suppose i m an approachable person and people feel like they can confide in me .","277115":"what is this even supposed to mean , lol . no , obviously i refer to them by their own names .","277116":"exactly ! ! i would feel as if i would be doing those anons a disservice , because i frequently have anons coming to my page and asking for advice that they wouldn t feel comfortable asking off anon .","277117":"this is a complicated question , because even though i did live with my ex for a few years at his house , i wasn t moved out of my parents house during that time either . i would stay with him for a few days , then return home and get more clothes and do laundry , etc etc . i also moved to massachusetts when i was years old to attend college , where i remained for one year until i moved back to new york . the only real solid move i ve experienced has been my recent move into a house with my two roommates , which we did last october . we ve been in this house for about nine months now . this living situation is the best , by far , because i ve established my own independence from my parents at last and can do things according to my own terms .","277118":"it s why i keep anon on , tbh . as many weird hateful messages as i get , there are also so many anons who are thoughtful and have been my anons for years .","277119":"lol , aw thank you","277120":"my weekend has gone pretty well , not gonna lie . it s been an incredibly lazy weekend , though . i did virtually nothing all weekend long except for friday night .","277121":"perhaps they re not married to the right person . i couldn t really give you a concrete answer on that , i ve never been in such a position before .","277122":"lol , i don t drink as much coffee these days as i used to . two cups in the morning at the most my coffee consumption was actually much worse when i was working in the office because we had a coffee machine in my department , lmaoo . but yeah , i drink water . and if i think i m getting too dehydrated , i always have a stock of gatorade in the fridge .","277123":"i ve never believed that a markup that extreme was plausible , that was just the example another anon in this thread offered . my initial presumption that people can buy things for cheap from thrift stores and sell them for much higher prices was based on my own limited understanding of the industry , not really influenced by anyone or anything in particular .","277124":"well , thank you for your openness and allowing me the time to become educated on the process . i realize that my initial response to the first question was rather ignorant considering i don t know the ins and outs of the industry . but now i have a clearer understanding of the details involved .","277125":"i agree with your grandfather , lol . the second it turns spring , all of my drinks are iced , like coffee and tea . unfortunately , because i ve been working from home , i ve been drinking hot coffee half the time because i make a pot of coffee every other day . the first day , i drink it hot . then i save the rest in the fridge , and have iced coffee the next morning .","277126":"comfortable silence is wonderful , tbh . you shouldn t feel pressured or obligated to talk the entire time you and your partner are together . if you two can sit comfortably in silence with one other i . e . , while watching tv movies together or you re both doing your separate thing in the same space , then that s healthy .","277127":"cont . . . you don t even know if it will resell ! i found a genuine valentino skirt once which was exciting but it was ugly af ! lmao . i put it on ebay for bidding and got a great price but that was a rare event . i ve had losses , things which barely sold over the purchase price ! i think this is from the same person ? i apologize if these two messages are unrelated . i m gaining a better understanding of the market through these messages , however . i ve never exactly been a fashion type of person , i buy my clothes from amazon lol . i don t even know what the value of designer clothing items are .","277128":"i do , but not very often lately considering it s summer time where i live , and the last thing i want is a steaming hot cup of tea , lol . i ve been drinking solely iced tea if i want tea in my life .","277129":"i m unsure . it will be good in the sense that people may be more cognizant of how they interact with other people , especially in terms of personal space and whatnot . but obviously it ll also be bad because our societies have been so shaken by what has happened that it s difficult to envision life going back to the way it was . like , there are some people who have already tried reverting back to that old lifestyle of going out with friends , having parties , going to the bar , etc etc . , and that s why rates cases have been skyrocketing again . covid is still clearly here , but some people are in such denial of how severe this is that they don t want to take accountability .","277130":"towards the end of the relationship , there was . we started seeing each other less and less maybe only once per week , and the same feelings weren t there anymore . i was still in love with him , but he didn t reciprocate those feelings as strongly anymore , and although we tried working through it , it was obvious we had just grown apart with age . honestly , our friendship is a lot stronger now than it was when we were actually dating , now that a lot of time has passed . we re still super comfortable around each other and there isn t even any tension or awkwardness or anything .","277131":"honestly , there is no difference . all of the work we do in done on the computer to begin with , and we a remote log in system to access our desktops in the office from our home computers , so everything is literally the same . i prefer working from home , tbh . sometimes i wish i could see two or three of my coworkers , but we also text often so it s not as if we re all completely disconnected . we also have a department wide happy hour zoom meeting every few weeks , which is fun and brings everyone together .","277132":"yes , i ve been working from home since march . my job hasn t said anything about if when we re even returning .","277133":"even without the threat of covid , there are still going to be concerns and worries because of how sudden and dramatic the change was between february and now for example . i can t really foresee society going forward as normal , and i do agree to some extent that there s going to be a new normal .","277134":"that s understandable . i ve only gone thrifting maybe once or twice in my life , i don t even know of any thrift stores around me besides the salvation army which i don t support anyway .","277135":"i m unsure of the morality of the situation , tbh . admittedly , i don t know very much about the diy industry because i ve never been very crafty . i do obviously understand people who buy items for cheap , refurbish them , decorate them , etc etc . , and then selling it for a higher price because of the cost of materials and labor involved , though .","277136":"my sleep is fine , if anything i over sleep sometimes because i can easily sleep for hours per night if i allow myself .","277137":"you evidently didn t read my last statement regarding language and trans identities .","277138":"educate me , then . i m open to have a civil conversation instead of being told off because of my ignorance towards the subject .","277139":"i was asked a question i answered that question . i m not sure why you re so pressed when i made my thoughts clear .","277140":"indeed . however , the language has changed in recent years as trans identities have been spoken about more often .","277141":"lol , you re right about that .","277142":"that s different from simply buying a piece of clothing and re selling it as it already is . if you re putting the time and effort into refurbishing the items , customizing them , etc etc . , then you should be compensated for your labor .","277143":"this is correct . i m not sure what you re trying to express here .","277144":"no , bisexual basically means you re attracted to genders like and unlike your own . being bisexual isn t transphobic .","277145":"i ve been drinking more often , but it has no relation to my smoking .","277146":"i eat a healthy diet most of the time , so in that respect , yes . everything else about my life . . . not so much , lmaoo .","277147":"yes , that makes complete sense . when i was running low on my pack like , less than cigarettes left , i would get a sense of worry and anxiety and would have to buy my next pack before the current pack ran out . it s an addictive mindset . quitting cigarettes is difficult , but i went from cigarettes to vaping so the transition was easier for me . my family still hates the fact that i vape because the effects on the body are inconclusive right now , but i still feel x better while vaping than i did when i was smoking cigarettes .","277148":"i quit smoking cigarettes , but i do vape occasionally . i ve had a cigarette here and there since i quit last year , but it definitely doesn t feel the same and it isn t something i miss . the cons totally outweigh the pros it got so bad that i would be coughing my brains out every morning before i had my morning cigarette .","277149":"lol , no that isn t the reason why we broke up . if that was the case , we would have separated years ago . i don t really have a preference , but i am more drawn to people with bold personalities , so interpret that as you wish . that could mean people who are extroverted with introverted tendencies , or introverted with extroverted tendencies . as long as that person understands that i need my own alone time to get through the day , that s all that matters .","277150":"he s extroverted for the most part , but he also does value his alone time a lot too .","277151":"i m doing pretty well today . it s been a relaxing day thus far , although i have done absolutely nothing productive lol . i m going to try to get some writing done this evening while my roommates aren t home .","277152":"i m fairly introverted , especially when i m by myself or around large groups of people . i gain energy by having alone time to myself , and i really value solitude . however , i m also a tad extroverted in a sense , but only around close friends . most of my friends are similar to me in that sense .","277153":"no , i meant my ex . lol , i m not dating anyone or in a relationship currently .","277154":"yeah , i have in the past prior to entering my most recent relationship .","277155":"it should be evident what my thoughts on child r pe are .","277156":"i considered the word pansexual years ago , yeah . i went by it for a while , but a few years ago , i felt that bisexual described me better .","277157":"technically , i already live on an island . haha .","277158":"yeah , i m bisexual .","277159":"red team ftw .","277160":"just because i live in new york state doesn t mean i know every celebrity who has lived in new york , lmaoo .","277161":"i was an adult at that time , so their music didn t interest me . when i did become interested in music when i was around years old , i listened to rock and hip hop .","277162":"i don t have an opinion because i ve never listened to his music before . i also didn t know he was a new york native , lol .","277163":"i didn t like music during the boy band era of the s .","277164":"it ll be uneven or i ll accidentally shave off chunks of hair that aren t meant to be shaved .","277165":"thank you ! ! my roommate actually has one , so if i get desperate enough , i might use his or at least ask him to try to shave it for me , lol .","277166":"no , i don t trust myself . lmao .","277167":"yes , i wholeheartedly agree with you . eventually , the truth always comes out and you end up feeling like an idiot for believing the lie , even though it wasn t your own fault . there are so many negative emotions that arise when someone is lied to and the truth is revealed , it hurts much more than if we were told the truth in the very first place .","277168":"i would like to get back into playing the keyboards again or piano , although i never played piano before .","277169":"regardless of how much the truth may hurt , it s much healthier to be told the truth than to be suppressed with lies . we all deserve to know the truth of various situations , and it s honestly disrespectful to someone if you re lying to them just to keep them happy .","277170":"i honestly can t even remember . . . it was probably applebee s with my roommate pre covid , haha .","277171":"i love tattoos , and i think they re an amazing expression of art . the human body is a canvas , and we can paint or decorate it in any way we desire . i have seven tattoos with plans to get several more .","277172":"lol . hell no .","277173":"i look like a mess today , lmaoo .","277174":"only if i know that person well enough , yeah . when it comes to friends and family , i can tell when someone is lying , trying to hide something , or trying to manipulate me and or others . when it comes to other people , it s a bit more difficult for me .","277175":"no , my family isn t close like that at all . we don t have any family traditions or recipes .","277176":"i ve never worn one before , and i probably wouldn t like it . i

the people who do that are clearly taking advantage of the situation by selling something way overpriced to another person , even though the original item was very cheap . it s one thing if you ve

marked up pricetag .","277188":"warning will break easily .","277189":"i don t remember the exact instance , but in general , i sometimes say things without thinking beforehand of how i m going to

there to shop for groceries , not to attract people . i usually end up shopping in a random tee shirt and shorts or leggings because it s most comfortable and the easiest to slip into .","277195":"yes , i have a pretty normal sleep schedule . during the week , i usually fall asleep around pm to midnight , and then i wake up at am . there s more flexibility on the weekends because i don t have work , so i ll sleep in as late as i want . last night , for example , i fell asleep around midnight and didn t wake up until am , haha .","277196":"i wear a mask when i go out in public because i care

no emotional connection to that person anymore and there s no hesitation .","277217":"i m planning on attending the gym once it s safe enough for gyms to open and i feel safe enough to go to one . i know there are at home workouts , but i ve never had the motivation or attention span to try to do those . at least when i m in the actual gym , i know my purpose there and it s much easier for me to motivate myself and get things done .","277218":"if there s one thing i do dislike about this house , it s how small and inconvenient the windows are , lol . i wish my bedroom windows were bigger , but we do have really big windows in the living room , so i guess that s a plus . they re also slider windows , meaning they open left and right instead of up and down . which makes it difficult during the summer since we needed to get one of those roll away air conditioning units to put the hose into the front window instead of getting a simple window unit , sigh .","277219":"they re subtle changes , but the changes are still there especially if you ve grown up around it and become accustomed to its introduction instead of being shown the stark contrast of now and then . an example is

even years ago , language was different from how it is now .","277224":"this is old from when i first moved in , but yeah .","277225":"language does change , which is why linguistics is such a popular topic area of study . language changes with the society that language is in , and there will always be different dialects depending upon the specific area you re in for example . it s actually really interesting .","277226":"i don t really think i have any unpopular opinions ? haha . quentin tarantino is a problematic person from what i ve seen , but his films are amazing . violent action films are better than comedies . movies made in the s and later aren t as good as older movies . napoleon dynamite is the worst movie ever created . the more gore , the better .","277227":"youtube , askfm ,

personal relationships . wikipedia i somewhat agree with the theory , but not entirely . i do believe that fostering positive thoughts does bring about positive change if you believe in your own drive and potential , but it definitely isn t a cure all . life is ultimately unfair , and we can be as positive as we can but still find ourselves in difficult or negative situations .","277255":"i ve had

the r word , you re being more inclusive .","277317":"the r word is considered a slur , not only by members of the community of those with autism and other developmental disabilities , but also in society as a whole . there s a reason that facilities that used to use the r word changed their name . i think it s a bit ridiculous to use the r word when there are so many other words you can use

realize how much stuff you own until you have to sort through it all and decide what to keep and what to throw away . the best part about having my own place is being independent from my parents , and

been a fan of those beards , that was such a s thing .","277388":"good morning ! ! today , i m planning on working until my regular scheduled time . afterwards , i m going to the bakery to pick up a cake for my father , as well as the drug store to get a gift bag and a card . today is his birthday , so i m going over my parents house for dinner .","277389":"i haven t started therapy yet . i just completed the paperwork for it , and i m supposed to begin next week via a video meeting .","277390":"by telling them that i m grateful for them , thanking them for what they ve done for me , etc etc .","277391":"thank you , i appreciate it","277392":"favorite thing the diversity of the environment . there are mountains upstate and beaches on the island , and there are also an abundance of various parks and gardens around . worst thing how expensive everything is around here , including food and gas and bills and rent , etc etc . people don t get paid enough to really survive and thrive here because the cost of living is too high .","277393":"nicotine and tobacco products .","277394":"sleep with a small light on not necessarily a nightlight , but i need to have one light on the room while i sleep at night .","277395":"i guess my x files hoodie ? idk , i don t really own any weird clothing .","277396":"making or buying an iced coffee , playing video games with friends at the end of the day , having a campfire outside , relaxing with a glass of wine while watching television before bed , being sent a meme or picture by a friend who says it reminds them of me , etc etc .","277397":"i try to show my gratitude toward other people on a regular basis , especially if they do something for me regardless of how small it is .","277398":"i impressed myself by making the perfect meal of avocado toast and fried eggs a few mornings ago .","277399":"for the most part , yes . a lot of people who are not trusting of others feel this way because at one point , they did trust someone too much and was backstabbed as a result . i can relate to this a lot , personally . i ve always been afraid to trust people unless i ve talked to them and connect to them a great deal , which can take months or years depending on the person .","277400":"some house party that i went to when i was attending college in massachusetts during my freshman year , i was years old . i don t remember very much about it i just remember being drunk and feeling very uncomfortable because i didn t know anyone other than my college roommate . i drank a lot of pbr up there , and i haven t had it since because even the smell of it disgusts me , lol .","277401":"teachers in general , especially teachers who teach anywhere from kindergarten through high school grades . their jobs aren t a simple hour week job they put in the hours teaching per day , but they also spend so much time outside of the classroom in preparing their lectures , grading homework and papers , making examinations , thinking of new ways to approach subjects , talking to parents , having meetings with colleagues and administration , etc etc . there is so much to teaching other than simply standing in the classroom and talking to students . most of the work is behind the scenes , and teachers also do not get financially compensated enough for the work they do .","277402":"hey , sorry for the late response it s been a wild day , and i m only getting deeply into my questions rn it s already pm . i can understand why you re paranoid about how they feel , but the rational part of me also thinks that you might also be overthinking the situation as well . i think the best approach would be to ask that person about their feelings toward the subject and explain that you don t want them to think of you any differently in light of it . there s definitely a stigma against it , even from professionals , so your worries are definitely valid . but again , considering it s all out in the open now , i would simply ask them their thoughts to make sure they don t think any differently of you .","277403":"yeah , that doesn t matter much to me . there are a lot of people in my family , so the chances of dating someone who has the same name as someone else in my family is pretty average .","277404":"fear of abandonment .","277405":"i m pretty good at art , i . e . drawing and painting , but i m not so great at crafting .","277406":"tuesdays , generally . it s still the beginning of the week and it still feels too far away from friday . mondays are generally not too bad because i feel refreshed from the weekend , but tuesdays are terrible .","277407":"uh , is this referring to sadistic or masochistic , or am i thinking too deeply into this ? lol .","277408":"last weekend , i drove my roommate to his girlfriend s house on saturday morning , then spent the rest of the day relaxing . on sunday , i had a telephone appointment with my psychiatrist and then i set up a separate appointment with a counselor .","277409":"my coworker is coming over on friday night to hang out since we haven t seen each other since early march ! !","277410":"i have so many , lol . lately i ve been re watching house md , but i also really like wentworth , castle , bones , criminal minds , ncis , parks and rec , how i met your mother , bob s burgers , it s always sunny in philadelphia , and game of thrones .","277411":"not really , no . i used to watch anime when i was a teenager toonami and stuff , but i haven t since i was years old .","277412":"? ? ? i ve known that i ve been ab sed since i was a teenager , because my ab se started , at the very least , since i was years old . i m not sure where you re getting the whole idea that a book gave me the idea that i m being ab sed , that s totally random .","277413":"a bench , table , and chairs for my outdoor patio , particularly a table where i can put an umbrella so there s a little bit of shade .","277414":"i don t follow mercury retrograde cycles , but apparently we re not in mercury retrograde right now . i don t necessarily believe in that sort of thing anyway .","277415":"i ve never jumped on one of those big , backyard trampolines . it looks like a lot of fun , though .","277416":"yeah , i was born and raised in new york state .","277417":"i rent a house with two roommates . it s decently sized .","277418":"i don t enjoy playing sports , but i was briefly on an adult volleyball league for one summer when i was in my early s . i was absolutely terrible at it , but i played with my friends so it was pretty fun .","277419":"i m doing well today . i got a decent sleep , surprisingly even though i fell asleep in my shorts and tank top , on top of the covers , lmaoo . i just ordered some comfort food for breakfast to make this morning more motivational for me . i don t have work for another nearly two hour from now .","277420":"i ve never been to a car show before , which is fine by me because i ve never been interested in cars before .","277421":"i m left handed .","277422":"unfortunately , nobody i know owns a beach house , haha . it sounds like it would be a lot of fun , though .","277423":"yes , i m so excited for it to be autumn and winter again ! ! i m over this heat and humidity i would much rather deal with the cold than the heat .","277424":"i ve never tried pecan pie before , but i have tried various fruit pies , like cherry , apple , blueberry , peach cobbler , etc etc . my favorite is cherry pie .","277425":"on occasion , yeah .","277426":"in terms of the stages of grief , there are five stages denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and acceptance . anger and depression have always been the most difficult stages for me , particularly because those are feelings i experience anyway outside of grief .","277427":"no , it s next monday . today i filled out the paperwork and whatnot and had to email it back to the office so that they can process it before next week .","277428":"i posted a few selfies earlier this evening .","277429":"no , i m not home alone and my roommate is in the next room . i d rather him not think i m talking to myself , haha . plus i m going to bed soon .","277430":"skyrim , fallout , the halo series , destiny , assassin s creed syndicate , the bioshock series , and minecraft .","277431":"i don t remember , lmaoo . this is based on what my friends have told me about the interaction .","277432":"yeah , i do .","277433":"yeah , the basement is where we keep our storage boxes . there s also a washer and dryer down there , as well as some other necessary household things like the water heater .","277434":"lmao . . . when i was very young and dating my ex , we were both drunk at a house party . some girl was quite obviously trying to flirt with him and getting close to him , so i ended up becoming jealous and angry . i stormed over , grabbed her by her hair , and threw her to the ground . not saying i condone that behavior , but . . . yeah . lmaoo . it was totally out of character for me .","277435":"i would rather be on the no fly list . it s imperative to have a car to get around where i live , and i wouldn t be able to live my life independently if i didn t have a driver s license .","277436":"it sounds like you re putting too much emotional effort into something on the internet that you shouldn t be so attached to . i m not obligated to answer every question in my inbox , and if i don t answer your questions , they re either not questions at all , trolling , ridiculous statements , or things i m not comfortable answering .","277437":"absolutely nothing , haha . i have zero plans for the upcoming months thanks to covid , unfortunately . in light of this , i ve simply been trying to take each day as it comes and live in the present moment .","277438":"i don t think i ve ever watched wall e before .","277439":"individuals with developmental disabilities .","277440":"i ve been broken up with and i ve also broken up with someone before as well . it s just the way life and relationships are .","277441":"i m not angry with anyone at the moment , especially an anon who s a complete stranger , rofl . there s no sense in harboring anger toward a stranger from the internet .","277442":"yes , it s considered a slur . the fact that you referred to it correctly as the r word only validates that fact .","277443":"i m currently single .","277444":"i woke up early this morning because it was hot in my bedroom , so i grabbed some ice water and opened my bedroom door to let the cool air in before going back to sleep for an additional hours . i normally wake up at am for work .","277445":"lately , nowhere else really besides the biweekly trip to the grocery store . i work from home , and in light of covid , i haven t gone anywhere else . the last time i saw a friend was on july th .","277446":"i don t have anything in my pockets , haha . i rarely ever put things in my pockets unless it s my phone when i m out going to the grocery store or pharmacy .","277447":"it s been several years since i ve been in a pool , tbh . i really can t remember when the last time was because nobody i know has a pool .","277448":"my clothing and shoes , as well as some old handbags from the past that i don t use anymore and a box of miscellaneous items from the move that i never sorted through .","277449":"i don t believe in the existence of god .","277450":"i didn t end up eating dinner tonight .","277451":"i don t follow celebrity news , so i don t know much about kanye besides the ridiculous things he s doing with respect to running for president , lmaoo . regardless , i do think he s a bit mentally unstable and i hope he can get some help because his behavior isn t normal .","277452":"i dislike the sound of my own voice too .","277453":"i ve heard about astral projection before , but i have no experience with it whatsoever .","277454":"no , i ve never burned sage before . however , it is something that my roommate wants to do because we re fairly certain that our house is somewhat haunted , lmaoo .","277455":"i don t know much about crystals at all , and it isn t something i necessarily believe in i . e . them having special powers and whatnot . i don t own any crystals .","277456":"my last outgoing call was to the director of the counseling center that i go to , because he left me a voicemail stating that they found a therapist for me . however , that didn t work out because they didn t have hours that accommodated my work schedule . my last incoming call was someone else from the counseling center , who had another therapist who could take me . this one did work out , and i set up an appointment with a new therapist for next week .","277457":"it isn t simply talk , it s scientific fact . wearing a face mask does help reduce the spread of covid , and it s ridiculous that there are so many people out there who are anti maskers and don t believe the words of health care professionals , who insist on everyone wearing a mask whenever they go out in public . if americans wore masks like they should , there would not have been such a rise in cases in recent weeks .","277458":"i look forward to reading the answers of shehitsback , manicmartyrdom , and courtneyuwu the most , likely because they re the three people to whom i m the closest from askfm .","277459":"i usually drink colombian coffee , or french roast if i m feeling something more bold .","277460":"you ll have to be more specific . type of what . . . ?","277461":"i drink coffee every day , lol .","277462":"the air conditioner is on , and has been on pretty much the entire time since we purchased it a few weeks ago , lol . it s a rollaway air conditioner , like one of those portable ones with the tube that goes into the window . even with the ac on , it still reads degrees in the house .","277463":"from starbucks , yeah . i went to starbucks for the first time since march last week .","277464":"yeah , i ve been saving money for a few reasons during this time . the biggest money drainer was gas for my car , because i would be driving miles per day to and from the office . since i ve been working from home , i haven t needed to use my car very often .","277465":"i m doing fine , although i m still really overheated and uncomfortable . i ended up taking a nap accidentally , which felt nice in the moment , but now i m hot again , lol . the sun is setting now , so i hope it cools off the later it gets .","277466":"to a small degree , yes . it wasn t a huge inconvenience , though . those are just privileges i experience , and obviously i can certainly live without doing those things .","277467":"they re literally different photos . i put them side by side here i m more leaning towards the one on the left .","277468":"they re different pictures . idk which one i like better .","277469":"i m not hungry , so probably nothing .","277470":"unfortunately , that s all for the selfies . i only took two today , lmaoo . in other news , it s hot as balls i m melting .","277471":", followers .","277472":"i saw the body drop on the o clock","277473":"everybody in the the world knows i m a little twisted","277474":"for the very first time ? my roommates cousin .","277475":"unfortunately , no . the few i ve seen as musicals are rent , the lion king , beauty and the beast , and memphis .","277476":"i ve never played golf before , no . i ve played mini golf on one occasion , though .","277477":"les miserables sweeney todd heathers the crow girl interrupted american psycho the shining the lord of the rings series robin hood men in tights the punisher","277478":"i mainly read fictional stories .","277479":"yeah , i used to be an avid reader in the past . i haven t read much in a while besides the book i picked up last night .","277480":"well , considering i m much older than years old , it s an adult drink .","277481":"it s technically pre mixed margarita , so i m not sure of the percentage . but i m on my second glass it s an on the rocks glass .","277482":"dark horse s sauvignon blanc .","277483":"you re not bothering me .","277484":"i m not quite sure what it is you re asking , but we do have an employee discount when we shop for groceries obviously as long as it s within the same chain of stores .","277485":"nah , i cleaned prior to drinking . i fed the cats and then mopped the kitchen and bathroom tiles . then i opened a bottle of wine , lol .","277486":"one of my roommates is a truck driver , and the other roommate is a manager of a grocery store .","277487":"i m not staying up for much longer , so we ll see .","277488":"unfortunately , not really . i m tired more than anything else but i don t feel like going to bed .","277489":"i m still watching netflix , so pretty well . i m on the last episode of the jeffrey epstein documentary .","277490":"yep . moving onto tequila soon because i finished off the bottle .","277491":"i m probably not going to sleep for a while , but i appreciate the concern .","277492":"stay inside , read books , watch television shows and movies , and indulge in the creative arts .","277493":"anything from intentionally flirting with someone to receive advances from them to down right having sex with another person .","277494":"my roommate apparently refers to me as his alcoholic roommate to his coworkers , which . . . i guess hurts my feelings ? but at the same time , i m not sure if it s actually true ? they questioned my roommate how i handled my money , and when he told them i handled my money extremely well , they seemed surprised . i thought that was rather insulting .","277495":"no , i don t consider that to be cheating .","277496":"oh please , i m allowed to have a few glasses of wine before bed . i m a grown adult , lol .","277497":"thanks ! ! the same to you .","277498":"other than wine , i only really drink beer and some liquors , i . e . tequila and amaretto .","277499":"i was interested in watching it , but i never got around to it . heavy subjects like this are things i can only watch when i m in a good state of mind ."}}
