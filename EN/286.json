, but even still , it s not as if they re painless . and you re not supposed to take even pain relief pills prior to the appointment because they re blood thinners , which will make it even messier for the artist . same thing with drinking beforehand .","264696":"no , not really .","264697":"uh , yeah . . . tattoos are painful af , lol .","264698":"oh , i didn t even think about that . i haven t gotten a new tattoo in like three years . perhaps when you do find a shop artist , you should contact them and ask what the best way to tip them would be . if not cash , then probably venmo .","264699":"this is indeed true . i ll probably pop on supernatural later today just to take my mind off of things . i was thinking of playing video games but i simply don t have the patience or

.","264707":"cont . . . obviously my words won t magically make things better , but i hope it helps to be reminded that you are awesome and bad days don t negate the good days and progress . thank you i genuinely do appreciate this . the stupid thing is , i know i m being super hard on myself but i can t ease myself out of that irrational line of thinking , lol . i ve talked to a few people about what my friend said to me prior to her basically cutting contact and they said she was wrong , which is what i thought too , so i m kinda at the point now where i m thinking whatever happens , happens . if she stops being my friend , then so be it . i called out of work today even though i was supposed to attend a small meeting this morning regarding one of my projects . i ve always been somewhat insecure about my performance at work and it s taking everything in me to not text my supervisor and ask her how the meeting this morning went , haha .","264708":"i love my tattoos .","264709":"instagram , their facebook page , if the artist or shop has a website , etc . i ve always found it helpful to make a post on facebook , as an example and ask local friends for their

has been declining the most during the past year .","264711":"very rarely .","264712":"haha , i guess that s true . a lot of my friends have a lot more than i do , and i also have friends who don t have any at all .","264713":"i only have seven tattoos , so i wouldn t consider myself a veteran , but i am experienced with a variety of different artists .","264714":"i can t even put a number to it

hours per night . i seldom wake up in the middle of the night , especially if i smoke before going to bed .","264721":"i m not going to the gym because of covid , and i lack the motivation to exercise at home because i m a depressed piece of sh t .","264722":"make sure you re going to a reputable artist sometimes it helps to visit their instagram pages or read reviews online . always pay for the tip in cash because then it goes right into their pockets . don t be afraid to tell the artist that you might need a minute to collect yourself if a certain spot is too painful it s okay to take breaks .","264723":"depends on what you mean by active , haha . i work during the day , so in that sense , i m active and productive in a work sense . however , i m active more on social media at night because i m not working .","264724":"i have short term and long term memory loss , so no .","264725":"no , i don t own any apple products .","264726":"it doesn t phase me either way . half of

place right now .","264742":"it s private .","264743":"she s actually a coworker of mine . we ve been very close for three years now . we haven t hung out because of covid and stuff , but we talk almost every day . i asked my other friend for his opinion and he said it sounds like she realized she was wrong and didn t want to own up to it , which makes sense but still . she s in her mid s . just apologize and we can move on , don t leave group chat and ignore my texts asking if you re okay .","264744":"maybe i pressed a button , idk . i can t see why else she would leave because it was after she was telling me a bunch of sh t about how i m too smart and talented to rely on xanax everyday and how meds aren t good because you get hooked on them , etc etc . she was essentially invalidating my mental health because i do , in fact , need meds to function daily . she sent like a long paragraph that i just didn t respond to , then i went back into snapchat and her messages were gone and she had left the group . like what .","264745":"sometimes , but not usually .","264746":"no , she isn t my roommate . i was talking to my roommate about it though . and no , this is a different friend .","264747":"i did . it was a bit lackluster , but i enjoyed it anyway .","264748":"childish gambino .","264749":"not as fast as i can type on a computer .","264750":"talking to my

back to the group and she left it again . so i texted her and she hasn t responded to that either . like . . . yeah , what she said was f cked up and my only assumption is that she heard me talking sh

to come to a resolution or closure about a topic with your significant other is to open a line of communication with them about your feelings .","265074":"how can i be following a trend because my eyebrows are naturally full ? lmaoo . if i was following a trend , i would be shaving off the tails of my brows and filling them in .","265075":"because i said ily , stay strong friend ? rofl . in all honesty , we should normalize saying i love you to our friends more often . love isn t always reserved for romantic feelings .","265076":"my sun sign is a water sign , which has always resonated with me because i ve always been able to adapt and go with the flow when things go wrong in my life .","265077":"a house that i own rather than renting the house i currently live in , haha

.","265086":"eh , to each their own .","265087":"zoos are gross , inhumane places for animals and i wish they weren t so popular . most of the time , the animals aren t take care of adequately , their enclosures are too small , and they re not in a proper environment for their species . every time i ve been to a zoo in my life , the animals looked so miserable .","265088":"in a friendship way , not in any other way , lol . i love all of my friends . cc svspicion","265089":"it s probably different from person to person , considering how unpredictable askfm s algorithms are these days . as for why

environment since then .","265097":"breakfast for dinner , all the time . i can t have anything besides breakfast foods in the morning , it just feels . . . unnatural to me , lol .","265098":"of course . just because you don t find yourself attractive doesn t mean that other people feel the same way towards you .","265099":"because nobody has answered it yet . sometimes my shout outs get sent out immediately , but most of the time , they don t and i get those answers weeks after the fact . because i like maintaining my vip status , i do send out the shout outs per week and most of those questions aren t answered by anybody at all . i really think askfm has set up some sort of queue , or something , because of how much traffic there is now regarding shout outs and vip .","265100":"i ve only ever heard it spoken through various chants and stuff on television shows , lol . i heard it s very difficult to learn .","265101":"black boots .","265102":"sometimes , yes .","265103":"i m just surviving at this point , trying my best to maintain my mental health and focus on my hobbies . i ve learned not to think too much into the far future because life can change instantaneously , and nothing is set in stone .","265104":"it isn t any of my concern , so i don t have strong opinions on it at all . learning a new language is entirely up to that person , especially if they re just visiting and not planning to stay long term . however , if that person is moving to another country where they speak a different language , then it would be beneficial for that person to learn the

more specific than this , because i m not sure what you re asking .","265109":"yeah , i know people who lost interest in vip but their account still has the vip up because they re still getting their points through their old shout outs that keep on being sent out from weeks and months ago .","265110":"i agree that it is super aggravating for example , i sent a shout out like two to three weeks ago asking people what they believe will happen on inauguration day in the united states , and it hasn t even been sent out yet , so it s going to look super silly when it does get sent out . . . whenever that will be .","265111":"neither , i liked wario the best .","265112":"it is most definitely possible , yes . i think what has helped me cope the most is focusing on the small brings that bring me joy and trying to connect with my friends whenever possible , which mainly includes video calls and playing video games with them .","265113":"i m not interested in dating , so it s pretty irrelevant to me right now . i will say this , though , i don t find bodybuilders or really huge muscles to be attractive at all that s just my personal preference . other than that , it really doesn t matter to me .","265114":"i haven t reached out to askfm , no . it s honestly happening to pretty much everyone who uses the shout out feature , so i m not sure if it s an easy fix . but either way , they definitely should have done a trial run with the vip feature before implementing it to have prevented stuff like this from happening .","265115":"i don t have cable , so i don t watch lifetime . i

recall it , though .","265122":"i deal with pain kinda well , considering i have tattoos in typically painful spots . i just tend to dissociate while it s happening , i think .","265123":"it s only

listening to music .","265124":"i over analyze things to a great extent most of the time .","265125":"i don t have any particular thoughts . as long as that man is happy with his body , or working

mood . most likely chinese buffet because i m more familiar with their cuisine .","265137":"i don t believe so , no . i watch people stream video games on twitch , but i do it on my computer

nothing happened , but i was doing all of the work in setting up the tables and the food , doing other chores around the house , cleaning up , etc etc . it s mentally taxing , especially when i m

someone else is just plain false .","265358":"i can see both sides , but the main issue is that celebrities have the privilege of having extra help in their work . for example , when maintaining their bodies , they have a team of nutritionists or personal chefs or trainers who guide them every step of the way . while shooting for movies or shows or performing music can be taxing on the body and mind , that doesn t detract from the mental and physical strain that other regular people go through in their own daily life . i think celebrities are overpaid , of course , and i think it s important for those celebrities to donate their money to good causes and contribute somehow to their communities in order to help the youth and working class climb the steps of the ladder easier .","265359":"in a professional sense , i believe so . however , in a personal sense , the highest form of education may not even be attainable because you can still learn even outside of the regular educational realm and knowledge is infinite .","265360":"i think people have a social advantage if they re conventionally pretty , but i wouldn t go so far as to call it a privilege .","265361":"i m five feet tall .","265362":"destruction .","265363":"that would be doing a lot of people a disservice , especially people who use medicinal marijuana to help with medical conditions .","265364":"i m simple , so i like chain restaurants like applebee s and chili s , haha .","265365":"to find a life of purpose .","265366":"i can t predict the future . however , i don t have a desire to date anybody at the moment .","265367":"a lot of celebrities are super privileged with respect to their wealth and power , and it s sad when they don t try to leverage that in order to help others . there are a good amount of celebrities who do contribute civically , i . e . donating money to foundations and nonprofits that help students go to school , but most millionaires and especially billionaires don t do so .","265368":"yes , but i haven t been to a museum in a very long time .","265369":"your family and society may say so , yes , but that doesn t make it true .","265370":"it isn t really okay to make fun of a person in general , unless of course they re trolling . rofl .","265371":"high education in general is a privilege . in the united states at least , a lot of students can t pursue higher education because it s too expensive , even with loans and grants and scholarships . you still need to pay out of pocket for food and books .","265372":"yeah , that s normal and common . you don t need someone else in your life in a romantic or sexual context , and if you re happy with yourself and your life , then that s all that matters .","265373":"yellow roses .","265374":"you can do either or . some people choose community college small two year colleges that provide you with associate degrees or vocational training , others choose regular colleges , and some people choose to go to universities .","265375":"colleges are normally smaller academic institutions dedicated primarily to undergraduate studies i . e . associate and bachelor s degrees . universities offer graduate and doctoral programs , and they re on a much larger scale .","265376":"i ve always wanted to learn latin , actually .","265377":"yeah , i like shows regarding ghosts and spirits and whatnot , especially ghost hunters , ghost adventures , and paranormal lockdown .","265378":"yes . in the united states , you have elementary school first , then middle school and high school , and then college university .","265379":"sometimes , particularly if i m not working , haha .","265380":"crackling fireplaces and campfires .","265381":"no , that has always come relatively easy to me .","265382":"no , i graduated from college in .","265383":"i m exactly the same way , haha .","265384":"no , i don t believe in god .","265385":"not anymore . i used to be obsessive with it .","265386":"do you expect anything better from askfm at this point ? rofl . this site has always been a dumpster fire , even before it became an app for the phone .","265387":"i m left handed , i m a scorpio , i m a writer by trade and play video games in my spare time , i love psychological thrillers and true crime documentaries , i love coffee and tea , and i m a mental health advocate .","265388":"seeing my friends smiling and laughing .","265389":"i think that s a great idea , or at least a different way to filter organize questions i . e . anon questions vs open questions , arranging them chronologically from oldest to most recent , subject matter , etc .","265390":"i wouldn t consider it lazy , no . some people require the extra help .","265391":"no , i wouldn t want a maid to clean my house anyway . my roommates and i are three able bodies adults , so we can clean the house just fine .","265392":"yeah , sometimes i have cravings for taco bell , haha . i usually order their veggie power bowl and nacho fries .","265393":"i ve always thought that while our physical body perishes , our souls spirits whatever you want to call them transfer mediums , as our essence is energy and energy cannot be destroyed . it s a bit similar to reincarnation , but it could also mean that those energies go back into the universe somewhere else .","265394":"i most definitely prefer the mountains over city environments .","265395":"no , i prefer taking photos myself .","265396":"cleaning the bathroom . it hurts my back and knees when i clean the tub , ugh .","265397":"i ve seen a meteor shower on one occasion . i was in my freshman year of college when i went away to school in massachusetts , and my friends and i laid down on a hill on blankets and looked up into the sky for hours .","265398":"i wouldn t have started self h rming when i was a teenager .","265399":"fleeting .","265400":"aw , thank you","265401":"yeah , i m turning later this year . i m indifferent to it . most of my friends and other people i talk to are older than me .","265402":"sometimes , but lately i ve been slacking .","265403":"i don t think i look good in most clothing , but i prefer skinny jeans over flared or bootcut jeans .","265404":"i d say between a and , on a good day . sometimes i get tremendous bursts of inspiration , while other times i m unmotivated .","265405":"my partying days are long gone , so i m a stay at home type of person now .","265406":"lately it s been sushi and veggie or pulled pork burrito bowls .","265407":"idk , i m a very socially awkward person so in those circumstances , i either stay silent or walk away .","265408":"i m quite aware of this .","265409":"nah , virtual window shopping is great .","265410":"for the most part , yeah . there are some days that i don t , but they ve been few lately .","265411":"if you don t know that person well at all , i would say that s a bit invasive , yes .","265412":"yeah , pasta is delicious .","265413":"no , i don t like sweet foods .","265414":"all the time , unfortunately . the phrase the customer is always right is a downright lie , lol .","265415":"i m indifferent to it . i m one of the youngest out of all of my friends .","265416":"i disagree . people of all languages are allowed in the united states , considering this country doesn t have an official language .","265417":"yes , all the time . the area where i worked was pretty diverse , so there were always people coming in who spoke broken english or sometimes none at all , and it was difficult to communicate with them . i remember having one customer when i worked in the photo lab , he wanted to make prints of photos but also edit them before printing , and it was difficult to understand exactly what he was trying to convey . i think we eventually resolved it through pointing and gestures , but it was so long ago that i don t actually remember .","265418":"les miserables is on netflix , and it s one of my absolute favorite movies .","265419":"i don t know anything about clinton s presidency .","265420":"cont . . . a child . adoption is an option i d consider when the right time comes but having a biological child is a definite no no . they like the idea of adoption too but they want a biological child too . i just dont know what the future has in for us . . . is the separation inevitable ? i don t believe separation is inevitable , no . if your partner is open to adoption , then that s something you both do agree upon . however , they do have to understand your health and concerns as well , because raising a biological child when you aren t mentally or physically ready for it would be doing everybody a disservice you , your partner , and that child .","265421":"my communication skills are decent , although sometimes it s difficult for me to express myself verbally . i prefer typing writing over verbal communication .","265422":"it can work for some people , yes . i know plenty of people who have met their partners online .","265423":"i don t miss anything that i don t already have .","265424":"yeah , i made scrambled eggs and bacon .","265425":"my life has had some amusing moments , but i certainly wouldn t consider it a comedy . unless it s a dark humor sort of comedy , lol .","265426":"considering it s pm , my day is pretty much over . however , i did pretty much nothing today besides work my usual schedule am to pm . after work , i talked to my roommates for a bit , then made dinner . i developed a horrible headache so i laid down for nearly two hours , and now it s late and i m wide awake . sigh .","265427":"i ve trolled trolls , if that counts . lol .","265428":"i like some jazz music , yes .","265429":"i read the news online . i haven t read a physical newspaper in years .","265430":"i prefer action movies over comedies .","265431":"i m never percent happy , but the most i can be is content . right now , i m very content .","265432":"not every day , but most days . watching netflix is a way for me to relax at the end of the night .","265433":"i just took a sip of my tea two seconds ago , haha .","265434":"i had a throbbing headache a few hours ago , so i took advil , laid down in a dark room , and put some crackling campfire sounds on for about . hours . i managed to take a nap . now that i m awake and feeling better , i m relaxing with hot peach tea that i poured a bit of winter jack into , and the taste is phenomenal .","265435":"i m a bit undecided on this particular situation , but i m more leaning towards the following someone let me know if my thoughts aren t all there sometimes , i believe it s okay to like certain things from problematic people only as long as you make it a point to recognize that they are problematic instead of , for example , denying it or making excuses for them . i . e . , i ve always been a huge harry potter fan but i know jk rowling is a piece of sh t . despite that , i still recognize the tremendous effect her books have had on me and i still enjoy the movies and listening to the soundtracks . and that s okay .","265436":"amanda gorman .","265437":"i have around contacts in my phone .","265438":"yeah , i ve heard of it before .","265439":"amazing . one of my favorite shows ever .","265440":"that s one of them , yeah .","265441":"in very unhealthy manners .","265442":"my closest friends .","265443":"probably , haha . i can t keep track of them all anymore .","265444":"how cadence copes with what she s going through is her business her business alone . there are tons of people who find god when going through difficult situations , and there s nothing wrong about that . cc svspicion","265445":"nah , i ve never done that before . i don t judge people who do , though . it s none of my concern .","265446":"writing and drawing , although i haven t done either in a while .","265447":"pm . right after i ve gotten out of work and i have the rest of the night ahead of me .","265448":"sounds good to me .","265449":"penne ala vodka and a ceasar salad .","265450":"well , my roommate got injured on the job today so we re putting off cleaning the house until tomorrow when he feels better . so i ll be working and then cleaning after work .","265451":"i don t watch animated movies generally , but moana was good .","265452":"commitment , communication , shared interests to a degree , respect , loyalty , etc .","265453":"during the day , but i used my phone a lot last night so i was going to charge it overnight and i guess i forgot to plug it in . lmao .","265454":"nope .","265455":"no , love alone isn t enough .","265456":"it s been okay i woke up to find my phone dead because i forgot to charge it , so i had no idea what time it was so i panicked hardcore , thinking i was late to work . thankfully i had a half hour before i clocked in . i ordered starbucks then worked my regular schedule , and when my roommate gets home , i m going to make breakfast for dinner .","265457":"yeah , if you want to get married they don t then you have to take those feelings into consideration . you re just going to be unhappy down the road the older you grow with that person , and it may cause strife in the relationship .","265458":"idk anything about your relationship , but honestly you should follow your gut . if you haven t asked him already , maybe bring the topic up and how you ve noticed he avoids the subject and you re just wondering why that is .","265459":"i knew that i had feelings for someone and she reciprocated those feelings , so we got together .","265460":"how you type on the internet isn t indicative of intelligence education level , lol . i have an english degree yet i don t use proper grammar or punctuation online because i don t care .","265461":"having feelings for someone else isn t cheating unless you act on those feelings . he did have feelings for someone else , which is why we broke up .","265462":"yeah , rofl . my ex had an active sweaty day at work once , so i asked him to shower before we settled in because he smelled bad .","265463":"years old .","265464":"eh , not really . i use slang sometimes i have a college education .","265465":"lol . what the hell ? she s actually a good friend of mine . we hooked up after drinking a bit too much wine , she spent the night , then left the morning after .","265466":"yes ! ! that s like the diners around here .","265467":"i absolutely agree , haha . i need to have a good breakfast otherwise my blood sugar levels get screwed up and i can t focus on anything .","265468":"i ve had a one night stand before , but it happened when i was single , haha .","265469":"probably ! ! idk why , but egg sandwiches at night taste so much better than in the morning , rofl .","265470":"uhhh , let s not . lmaoo
