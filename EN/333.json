intersectional feminism , but i feel uncomfortable calling myself a feminist because this generation s movement has gotten a bit ridiculous and people have become way too pc to the point where all

identity , and i m helping them .","308116":"no , assigned sex . if you identify with your sex , then you re cis . if you identify anything other than your gender , then you re trans . how do you know your own gender , for example ? you simply know . you know you re a man or woman or whatever you are , and you don t question it . the same thing with trans people . they know that they re not their assigned sex , regardless of what gender that is .","308117":"it depends entirely on the individual . if you have a parental instinct , then it comes naturally to you and you believe that it s worth it . if you don t have a parental instinct , then it seems as if it s either a waste of time or not worth the effort and energy .","308118":"to be a woman simply means that you identify as a woman , whether you re cis or trans . like i said before , it s something you just know and most people know from a very young age and question their gender for years . it has nothing to do with likes or dislikes or aspects of your personality because you can like stereotypically womanly or manly things while still being cis or trans .","308119":"i suppose i would choose engineer considering my

transition accordingly .","308121":"no , he was asleep in the bedroom . i do believe in ghosts and i wholeheartedly believe it was my boyfriend s mother messing with me . it s something she would do

actually really proud of the way it came out . i ve also been able to spend the weekends with my boyfriend , so those are highlights as well . it s nice to sit down and relax with your partner for once .","308126":"what exactly are you confused about ? your gender is who you are separate from your personality . it s feeling whether you re a woman or a man or somewhere in between . just like how cis people know they re men or women , trans people know their gender doesn t match their assigned sex . it matters to some people obviously because it s a large component of who they are and some trans people experience dysphoria , which means they feel as if they re in the wrong body . it greatly affects self esteem and self image . here s a somewhat okay chart to help explain","308127":"no , i don t really feel that way because i get a lot of personalized questions myself on a daily basis and sometimes i prefer that over spam questions that get sent to everybody . i understand that some

throughout my life , and despite falling on difficult times and struggling a lot with my mental health , i ve always found the courage to push forward and do something with my life that gives it

life .","308130":"i swear to god there are ghosts in this house . i was helping my mother cook dinner and we made plates up with meat , green beans , and mashed potatoes . my meal was on a floral

represent about . of the population , although that number is expected to be higher due to the amount of people who aren t out yet . trans people are more likely to be physically sxxually assaulted , which results in higher rates of attempted svicide . about of trans people have attempted in the past . likewise , of trans people feel more comfortable with themselves after they ve transitioned , especially in workplace settings . that s why hrt and transition surgeries are so important . being transgender is not a mental disorder , contrary to popular belief . while some trans people are mentally ill , there s no correlation between the two concepts . trans people are just as deserving of acceptance as people of other gender identities , and there needs to be more awareness of trans identities in society .","308139":". . . i already explained this . if you don t want to believe me , then that s on you .","308140":"male and female are sexes . they re your biologically assigned sexes at birth . gender is how you feel toward yourself and how you express yourself in terms of man , woman , trans , non binary , etc etc . if your gender doesn t match your assigned sex , then you

to look at , but they die pretty fast so it s a fairly worthless gift to give to somebody .","308150":"uh , yeah . i really hope this line of questioning isn t going somewhere creepy , though .","308151":"i usually confront them straight away . i have no time or patience to play games with people to see if they ll continue lying , and i would rather be honest and confront them with the issue first hand rather than wait for the perfect moment . thankfully i ve never had to really deal with this situation that often . it s come up a few times in the past with certain ex friends , but i cut them out of my life after finding out they were lying .","308152":"i ve always wanted to learn how to play the piano . i taught myself a few simple songs when i was a teenager , but nothing significant . i believe the piano is one of the most beautiful and expressive instruments .","308153":"probably a hell of a lot more tolerant than the world currently is the majority of the world is

most people are assholes and simply piss me off , and it s rare that i actually feel comfortable around someone when meeting them for the first time . i m very guarded around others because most people have ulterior motives .","308155":"uh , people aren t inferior to you if they don t make as much money as you do . money doesn t define who a person is by any means , and you re not a better person by default simply because you have more money than someone else . if i somehow got wealthy , i wouldn t care who my child dated as long as they were kind and respectful .","308156":"not really i m more antisocial , than anything else . i ve learned to come out of my shell over the years , but i simply have no desire to talk to or be around most people .","308157":"probably my best friend she s always been kind and understanding to me even when i wasn t exactly deserving of kindness , and she has always jumped through hoops to make sure i was okay even if it was putting her own safety at risk . i don t deserve kind people in my life , tbh . lol .","308158":"i ve always thought that coffee tea shops were among some of the best places to go because the environments are usually quiet enough to really be able to have a conversation with someone and get to know them on a personal level . however , it s entirely up to both people ! ! my boyfriend and i went to dinner and to various parks and beaches on our first couple of dates , and they were a lot of fun .","308159":"a person s conscience is their own set of morals and ethics their belief system , their concept of right vs wrong , etc etc . i believe most people have consciences , but there are obviously a few exceptions i . e . serial killers or other murderers . like most other things , it s likely a combination of both genetics and environment , something innate in a person as well as learned over time .","308160":"i ve mainly learned interesting or intimate details about my friends lives , which makes me feel closer to them in a way . the good thing about askfm is that you become educated about who a person really is and how they think . it s also helped me learn who not to interact with based on how people respond to others , especially if it s in an unkind way if it isn t warranted .","308161":"not usually , no . i live with my parents and help out with the cooking most nights , but it isn t generally a responsibility of mine .","308162":"i brought coffee .","308163":"i believe everyone is photogenic in some way because everyone has a different concept of what s attractive . there will

that last answer , and i hate how i have no concept of emotional permanence whatsoever . little things like the tone of people s voices set me off , and i constantly overthink what people mean when they talk and look for hidden meanings behind everything . ulterior motives . insinuations . i can t stand it . i m ruminating on a conversation i just had and now i feel like i m spiraling . and now i m slipping into an episode because i can t control how people say things and my mind is reeling over what they could have meant and if they re angry with me . if they re going to give up on me . but i can t express this to them otherwise it s going to make it larger than it should be , and i m afraid of them saying that they are angry with me because i won t be able to handle that . this has been happening too much lately and its exhausting .","308183":"lol i m never genuinely happy thanks to depression but i ve been okay lately . the only thing that s bothering me is that my car is running on

witty comebacks and the writing is great . you can really see the character development over time .","308194":"not generally , no . i enjoy horror movies a lot the only things that freak me out are

tired of anons coming onto my page and claiming they know my life better than me especially with respect to my gender , my financial situations , etc etc . it doesn t matter what other people think because i only air a small portion of myself on the internet therefore , their opinions will always be inaccurate . the fact that some people are so concerned with my gender is a bit alarming because i ve had anons literally fuming with anger over the fact that i m non binary .","308204":"i don t really like this question and would feel weird answering it i don t have much of an answer either way because my mental illnesses magically disappearing is an unrealistic thought .","308205":"i prefer to avoid confrontation , but if i feel strongly enough about something , then i ll feel the need to

only attracted to my boyfriend . even if i was single , that would be creepy af . that s years younger than me and they re in a different stage of life than me .","308218":"i m not much of a texter , and my boyfriend and i prefer calling each other on the phone instead of texting because it s easier . he works all of the time , so a quick phonecall when he s on break is more efficient than texting him and waiting hours for a response .","308219":"it s been passed on from generation to generation those who exhibit racism today likely was taught racism by their families or friends . the only way to break the cycle of racism is to continuously educate others and raise our own children without prejudice .","308220":"looks like you re shit out of luck , fam . when you re on askfm , there really is no such thing as normal .","308221":"when you re in a healthy relationship , there really is no such thing as loving someone more . you love one another regardless of your flaws and mistakes , and there really is no basis for comparison between your love for your partner and their love for you . when you re in a relationship , you work as a team , thus rendering any sort of competition to be irrelevant .","308222":"yes , i believe that is an invasion of privacy . you must respect your child s privacy and in return , they will respect you back . if you go through your child s things without consent , then that gives them valid reason to distrust you as a parent . the only exception to this would be if the parent has valid suspicions that their child is doing something harmful to themselves or others , i . e . drugs , sh , svicidal ideation , etc etc .","308223":"absolutely , yes . mental illnesses can be just as debilitating as physical illnesses , preventing a person from being able to carry out their ordinary activities of daily living and functioning correctly in a work environment . i worked for a disability law firm for more than two years , and we had thousands of mental health cases , both alone and existing with other physical conditions . in most cases , mental health problems only exacerbated physical illnesses and vice versa . having mental health problems makes living with physical disabilities even more difficult , and physical illnesses often have the ability to make mental health problems worse as well .","308224":"of course it is crying is a natural human reaction to emotional and physical stimuli , and it doesn t make someone less of a man if they cry . crying is a form of cathartic release , and it helps release endorphins into the bloodstream , the feel good chemicals that provide us with a sense of relief after we ve cried . it s purely a biological reaction , and it has no bearing on someone s gender .","308225":"i fail to understand why this is pertinent information for a complete stranger to know .","308226":"yeah , my boyfriend . he deserves more than what the world has given him .","308227":"even if the government doesn t do anything after today s marches , that certainly doesn t mean that activists should give up their fight and by the looks of things , the most passionate activists are the teenagers and young adults who will comprise the next generation of politics . even though things seem terrible right now , especially in terms of gun control , i honestly do have faith in the foreseeable future because our government has brought out the motivation and drive of young activists to make permanent changes .","308228":"background checks , funding gun violence research and prevention , eliminating high capacity magazines , etc etc . it can be found on their website https marchforourlives . com how we save lives","308229":"i agree . if supporting marchforourlives makes me a radical activist , then a radical activist i will become . you cannot look at the recent shootings in florida and alabama and think to yourself that things should stay the same . the only way for things to change is to protest , rally , and march to allow our voices to be heard .","308230":"advocating for gun control certainly isn t a radical view , especially in light of the increasing number of shootings this nation has witnessed in alone . gun control will never be pointless , and at this current point in time , it s necessary in order to protect the lives of our children and the generations after us . there s no harm in making it more difficult for people to obtain guns because those who will use those guns responsibly won t find it problematic to go through processing in order to be a registered gun user .","308231":"enoughisenough we ve seen too much gun violence in recent years , and we should be protecting children instead of protecting guns . enough is enough , and this needs to end . this isn t just about the parkland shootings this is about every shooting that has occurred that has been the result of lax gun laws , every shooting that has taken the lives of innocent people , every shooting that has rained terror down upon grieving families whose names did not even garner media coverage . keep saying their names and keep allowing your voices to be heard , on any platform that s available to you . the time for change is now .","308232":"which answer are you referring to , anon ? i apologize if i haven t quite met your standards , but nevertheless , my thoughts are my own and i won t apologize if someone happens to disagree with my views .","308233":"black people are still largely discriminated against in this country , especially in lgbt circles . according to society , it s more socially acceptable to be white and trans than it is to be black and trans , and there s less media coverage on black lives lost compared to white lives lost . it s ridiculous and needs to change , much like everything else going on in our country rn .","308234":"stone temple pilots , alice in chains , soundgarden , korn , audioslave , in this moment , otep , halestorm , royal blood , grandson , missio , muse , rob zombie , nine inch nails , five finger death punch , chevelle , breaking benjamin , etc etc .","308235":"two positives i got my tax returns back ! ! i saw my boyfriend last night and had a good time . one negative my friend s dog passed away this morning , and i feel absolutely terrible for her and her family . he was the sweetest boy .","308236":"yes , that s actually one of the key symptoms of bpd which can be most debilitating for people with the disorder . we tend to think in extremes and our emotions are heavily influenced by our environment , so even small and insignificant events may set us off and cause a tidal wave of emotions and reactions .","308237":"i honestly don t know anything about it , believe it or not . i haven t done adequate research on the topic .","308238":"i don t really talk much about the specifics of my personal life all i really talk about is mental health and social issues , so by all means , if my own personal cia agent wants to use that information somehow , they re free to do so .","308239":"eating habits , yes i try to eat healthy whenever i can . current weight , definitely not . i m about pounds overweight from how i used to be a few years ago , and i would like to lose those pounds within the next year .","308240":"i wish i had an answer to this question .","308241":"aw , thank you","308242":"my genitalia isn t exactly anyone s business besides my boyfriend .","308243":"i usually make it hot because i don t have the time or patience to wait for it to cool down in order to make iced coffee . i don t really get creative with coffee because there isn t much you can do with k cups , unfortunately . however , i ve gone to my best friend s apartment and she puts cinnamon in her coffee grinds , which tastes amazing .","308244":"anons just keep trying to put a rift between us and it s obviously not going to work , lol .","308245":"obviously you don t praise people for dropping out of high school , but it isn t something to be ashamed of either . life happens and sometimes school becomes impossible .","308246":"college isn t important to some jobs , so she s right in that aspect . my best friend is making more money than me and she never graduated college . also , i know plenty of people who dropped out of high school who are still intelligent , so it s a pretty shitty thing for you to point out . the jobs i chose required degrees , which is why i chose them .","308247":"no i don t follow people or like their answers upon request . i only follow a small amount of individuals , and i only like answers that i find to be interesting .","308248":"you can do whatever you want . profit from purchases go toward mental health charities , so the more people who buy the mugs , the better .","308249":"for my anon this is the most recent drawing i have saved on my computer . not exactly the best work i ve done , but i was proud of it at the time .","308250":"yeah , i used to draw a lot when i was younger . i contemplated going to art school , but i went for writing instead .","308251":"i mean . . . i wouldn t consider myself to be famous ? ? however , my page is active because i tend to log on every day and answer questions , which prompts people to ask me more questions , i suppose . my page isn t nearly as active as it used to be , though .","308252":"i m answering questions on askfm on my laptop , drinking a large thermos of oz of coffee , and i m about to put some music on ! ! i m also about to go out for a cigarette and assess how much snow i m going to have to shovel later this morning , ugh .","308253":"i never understood why people wanted to know such useless information as this . i highly doubt you re going to be able to get off knowing the exact time and date i last had sex .","308254":"lol well it looks like we ll be getting those inches after all fml .","308255":"it isn t hypocritical at all like lakocis said , i came to him willingly to answer his question , unlike random anons who ask sexual questions without consent and expect you to answer them with effort involved . either way , this shouldn t even be a topic of conversation . . . like , at all . it s just fun .","308256":"lol , this is true too . i feel comfortable around liam therefore , i felt it wouldn t be weird to discuss this dilemma with him as well as the three guy friends i have with whom i m currently discussing this via text message .","308257":"i m shit with a hammer , but i ll happily hold the toolbox for you and hand you whatever tools you need .","308258":"there s a noticeable difference between discussing sexual matters with friends and being asked an inappropriate question online by an anon . . . . also . . . it s a hypothetical event . obviously i m not going to run around and get random people off just on a whim , lmao .","308259":"i literally just participated in his little sucking off event , lmao . y all need to chill .","308260":". . . this isn t a question .","308261":"uh , by simply asking them do you answer sxxual questions ? it s literally that simple .","308262":"soo i m like sure that i m not going into work tomorrow considering it s averaging about inches of snow per hour , so y all should ask me some questions while i drink some beer","308263":"i absolutely love chest tattoos , on pretty much everyone regardless of their gender . it obviously depends on what the tattoo is and how talented the artist is , but most of the ones i ve seen have been quite beautiful . the only chest tattoos that i believe are over done are the ones in script font that goes across the collar bones .","308264":"lol just because you have the opportunity to ask people inappropriate questions while remaining anonymous doesn t mean that you should . there s a concept called respect that you seemingly lack .","308265":"question not to ask random strangers on the internet .","308266":"how life was before smartphones and tablets came out , how my boyfriend and i first met , and what i did for fun when i was younger . that would be the best case scenario . however , most children would probably ask weird questions like why does spaghetti taste like spaghetti ? or how did you get so fat ?","308267":"you just reminded me that i have samoas , fuck yes .","308268":"i really like too faced products especially their sweet peach eyeshadow palette . however , i use an array of different brands depending on what sort of makeup i need . lipstick tends to be colourpop or kat von d although courrtana just gave me a lovely jeffree starr lipstick . contour kit is by e . l . f . and works magically . i also have highlighters from e . l . f . and too faced , as well as mascara and setting spray from too faced .","308269":"the previous anon said devolve , which basically means the same thing as break or lessen . however , i would realistically like to develop healthier exercise and eating habits within the upcoming year . i have a gym membership that i haven t used in a while , and i want to begin going to the gym and running again .","308270":"i want to break my skin picking habit it s been preventing me from getting new tattoos and fixing up my old tattoos , and tbh i m tired of being embarrassed over how terrible my skin looks . people stare at me and think there s something wrong with me due to the scars all over my arms , and it s frustrating .","308271":"i have a few friends who are republicans , but we simply don t discuss politics in depth . i recently learned that one of my friends is actually homophobic transphobic sexist , so i m pretty disappointed that i didn t see the signs earlier on .","308272":"probably i can barely remember last week , though , let alone five months ago . i ve noticed that activity is slowly dwindling , but i don t know if that s simply because i don t follow very many people are a lot of them are losing their interest in askfm .","308273":"idk , the concept of logging in every day and seeing which questions you get has always interested me people being intrigued by my answers , wanting to get to know me , etc etc . it sounds incredibly self indulgent , but i think everyone on this site likes talking about themselves , otherwise they wouldn t have an account . i also like asking questions occasionally and seeing the answers my friends give , getting to know them more personally , etc . i ve made a few friends because of this site .","308274":"probably askfm , lol . i m hopelessly addicted to this forsaken website . other than that , probably instagram . i try to update my stories every day , and i usually try to catch up on my feed every day .","308275":"ah , thank you for the clarification ! ! i can see how it would be bizarre , but i also understand as well , especially considering how intolerant the middle east is of gay relationships . i knew that there was a high rate of transition operations in iran , but i wasn t entirely sure of the reason . thank you for this insight .","308276":"i probably wouldn t deal well with living somewhere in the middle east , considering i m non binary , female by birth , and bisexual . knowing my luck , i would run into the wrong crowd and get killed for who i am .","308277":"people who don t use their blinkers while driving . people who are rude to baristas waiters bartenders etc . people who are rude and hurtful to animals . people who make a joke out of things i m passionate about . people in general .","308278":"i m a bit hesitant to support it while it s good for law enforcement purposes , i . e . catching criminals via cctv , it can also be construed as a means of violating one s privacy in a big bother kind of way . you simply don t know what the footage will be used for in the future .","308279":"perpetual screaming .","308280":"i haven t been to a party in years , but normally i was the one hosting the party , so no . i would get drunk at the party , but not before the party officially started since we were usually too busy setting up .","308281":"i don t know what type of men are in your life , but i can assure you that this is very far from the truth , lol .","308282":"cookies , cinnamon vanilla , thanks to an amazing candle that s supposed to smell like the burrow from the harry potter books .","308283":"for the most part , no . i m usually friendly to everyone unless they give me a reason not to be friendly to them , which is normally prompted by rude comments from the other person .","308284":"let s put it this way i don t play games unless i m good at them , otherwise i just get frustrated and rage quit . i m really good at fallout and skyrim , and there was also a point in time when i was terrific at destiny . however , i haven t played destiny in a long time , so i m sure my skills are shoddy by now .","308285":"i m envious of professional gamers the concept of actually making money by playing video games is wild to me , and i only wish i could get into that sort of profession , lol . i watch rooster teeth achievement hunter , and they re technically professional gamers . i went to a let s play live event where i watched members of achievement hunter play video games live on stage , and it was glorious .","308286":"no , i m not really a fan of tablets used to read books . i understand the appeal of them since you can store your books all in one place , but i prefer reading a physical book . there s something tranquil about buying a book from the bookstore and making it your own , crinkling the pages while reading and allowing it to grow with you .","308287":"yeah , that s relatively normal . some people don t show until their sixth or seventh month . it isn t out of the ordinary .","308288":"i used to watch anime when i was a teenager , but i haven t seen it in recent years . my favorite movie in the anime genre is spirited away , though .","308289":"no , i d say that s fairly common . you can like two people for two entirely different reasons depending on their respective personalities .","308290":"my favorite background noise is the skyrim soundtrack i usually have it playing in the background when i m answering questions on askfm or trying to write . there are videos on youtube of some skyrim songs with rain ambiance overlaying the music .","308291":"y i k e s","308292":"ideally , my boyfriend and i would move down to virginia , or somewhere in that region it s something we ve actually discussed a lot over the past few years when contemplating our future together . long island is over rated , anyway . it s extremely expensive to live here , and most people i know have moved out of state .","308293":"i ve only ever used samsung phones , so that would be my natural decision . i ve never had problems with them over the years .","308294":"my entire life is a series of reckless decisions , lol . however , my worst moments were when i was years old . i was constantly drinking , on drugs , throwing parties , etc etc . i used to drive drunk and high , and i participated in a lot of illegal activities .","308295":"yeah , i get pimples every now and again . thankfully they re never anything worse than whiteheads and they disappear within a few days .","308296":"i honestly wouldn t know , we ve never talked about that before . i ve never been comfortable posting nsfw pictures of myself on the internet .","308297":"watsky and macklemore ! ! both of their music is ridiculously good , and i always recommend them .","308298":"i take and share nsfw photos with my boyfriend , but he s the only person i feel comfortable with photos like that of me .","308299":"i was craving a cheeseburger and fries , so after my therapy appointment , i went to mcdonalds lol . i have absolutely no self control .","308300":"i just checked , and of course the answer got deleted someone said that i constantly pushed the fact that i was gay in everyone s faces , which obviously isn t true because i seldom talk about my sexual orientation lol .","308301":"insert story about overcoming significant trauma and suffering from multiple mental illnesses and addictions as a result","308302":"my current job is a hell of a lot better than my previous job , and i m actually not stressed out at all as compared to my previous job where i was stressed . my supervisors are also really understanding of my mental health issues so i don t feel awkward talking to them about it if i need to take a day off or leave early .","308303":"it s ironic that you sent this to me because right before this message was a message attacking me for being bisexual , lol . either way , the reason why my answers aren t savage anymore is because i seldom get anon hate these days .","308304":"the supernatural element of the movie , you mean ? ? idk i thought it was rather interesting , which is why it s one of my favorite films . if you read the book , the supernatural element is more apparent early on so it doesn t come as much as a surprise compared to the film .","308305":"yes , although they re not professional diagnosed as such . i know a person who claims to be mentally healthy but exhibits all of the traits of narcissistic personality disorder to the point where it becomes detrimental to their relationship to their family .","308306":"ahh , thank you so much ! !","308307":"one of my pet peeves is getting useless questions like these from anons whose inquiries are more fantasy than reality .","308308":"my new thermos is so beautiful","308309":"i prefer candles because i have some really amazing smelling ones that my best friend bought me for xmas ! !","308310":"my day has been fine albeit rather boring , since all i did was copyedit and proofread narratives . i prefer to break up my work days with some writing , but there were too many narratives to look over , so i ended up spending the entire day doing just that . however , i m also happy because my mental health awareness thermos came in the mail ! ! it holds oz of liquid , which means all the more coffee for me . and of the profits go towards mental health initiatives .","308311":"i don t have a single favorite question because i m fairly neutral on most questions , unless they re obviously trolls or spam or hate . however , i prefer personalized questions catered to my interests , i . e . mental health awareness , my career education , my relationship , video games , writing and art , etc etc .","308312":"i hate to be the bearer of bad news , but the person you admire on askfm isn t going to be your one true love , nor are they likely to even become a significant other . for the sake of your own heart , i would personally try to abandon feelings for this person because there s a chance that nothing is going to happen to begin with .","308313":"no need to apologize some anons will simply create drama out of absolutely nothing just to suit their own personal agenda . hopefully now this anon will stop harassing the two of us and creating a big deal out of what was just a simple answer .","308314":"uh , obviously i m not trying to change anyone i don t know why you insist that liam believes in two genders when he never said anything of that nature to begin with . regardless of what he believes , perhaps you should take his advice and accept people for who they are , trans or otherwise . cc lakocis","308315":"no i know a few trans and non binary people who don t experience dysphoria , and that s perfectly acceptable . not everything is black and white when it comes to gender , which is why it exists on a spectrum .","308316":"i have a myriad of favorite movies heathers , girl interrupted , the crow , the shining , the punisher , lord of the rings , the craft , v for vendetta , the purge , american psycho , and i am not a serial killer , just to name a few .","308317":"insert quote about surviving through trauma without a second thought yet having a meltdown when i can t decide what to wear in the morning","308318":"i don t believe in the concept of sin , so i don t have an answer to this question . everyone at some point in their lives do questionable things and make mistakes , and it doesn t make them bad people .","308319":"a yogurt parfait with fruit and granola , a banana , and an iced coffee .","308320":"i don t know what this is supposed to mean . what exactly are you asking ?","308321":"i ve never heard of that before , so evidently not .","308322":"lol , no not at all . my reading voice is incredibly monotone and i stumble over my words a lot . i wouldn t be comfortable as a news reader or a radio person , which is why i chose not to enter those fields upon graduation .","308323":"absolutely terrible . i m already overweight and another pounds would absolutely destroy me . i m extremely self conscious of my weight to begin with .","308324":"i suppose my art easel with paint supplies , colored pencils , and charcoal , as well as my journal where i document all of my poetry .","308325":"he s an extremely hard working individual i can t tell you how many weeks in a row he s been working overtime at his job . he always needs to keep himself busy , whether it s at work or caring for his animals or building a new project . he s a very hands on type of person . at the same time , he s also extremely deep and emotional . he paints and writes poetry on occasion . he s hand his own handful of hardships which have shaped him , but he s never let those events define him . he s one of the strongest people i know .","308326":"no , i only started shaving my head this year . however , when my hair was short when i was in high school , i used to style it into a fauxhawk .","308327":"i would likely go into the recent past , i . e . the past few years since turning , and re experience some of my fondest memories .","308328":"you can t control with whom you fall in love for the most part , but generally i ve found that i m more attracted to people who are different than me outgoing , strong personalities not afraid to speak up for what they believe in not caring about what other people think of them etc etc .","308329":"lol , i d rather not get into that my entire life from ages to was a dumb idea .","308330":"i like painting , but i m terrible at it . this is the only painting that i have readily available in my house rn","308331":"when people ask me to follow them shout outs i can t stand them for some reason people who respond to my answers with their own answer to the question i was asked statements that aren t questions inappropriate sexual questions pretty much anything ben sends","308332":"my boyfriend thank you for being the hard working , passionate , and caring person that you are you ve helped me more than you realize , and you provide never ending support for me during my bad mental health episodes . i wouldn t have gotten this far without your love and tenderness , as well as your drive to understand my emotions , even if they are irrational . i wouldn t be alive if it wasn t for you , and you ve provided inspiration for me to continue living on multiple occasions . you ve inspired me to strive to be the best person of myself that i can be , and your confidence in me only pushes me forward . i m forever grateful for you .","308333":"there are a lot of vineyards and brewing companies where i live ! ! if you re into drinking alcohol , then long island is the best place for you because there are vineyards speckled all across the north fork and brewing companies pretty much everywhere else . you can make an entire weekend out of it .","308334":"they can t consent to the activity if they re toddlers or babies even if i had a child , i would only pierce their ears if they specifically asked for it , and i would go to a professional piercing salon instead of somewhere like the mall .","308335":"i don t really think any of my opinions are unpopular because they re shared by thousands of people . however , my most controversial opinions i m pro choice and support abortion i believe there should be stricter regulations on guns i m anti circumcision i don t believe children should get their ears pierced before they reach puberty i m anti death penalty marijuana should be legalized and taxed insurance should cover costs of hrt and transition surgeries trans and gay people deserve the same rights as cis and straight people men are also prone to being victims of domestic violence and more awareness should be spread of this issue","308336":"i m always honest so there s no point in me having an honesty hour .","308337":"i definitely answer questions more often i answer questions every day , while i only ask questions perhaps twice a month , if even that often .","308338":"not generally , no . i m extremely guarded when it comes to meeting new people and i don t trust people easily unless i ve spoken to them for an extended period of time and we get along well . i also have no interest in making new friends because i have enough people in my life as it is . i m content with the small group of friends i have now .","308339":"yeah , i love the outdoors and i generally feel more comfortable when i m outside instead of being cooped inside of the house all day . during the spring and summer months , i like spending time wandering around parks and wooded areas because it feels most like home for me .","308340":"i don t think i would be able to handle having a csi job , mostly because i wouldn t be able to cope with telling families that their loved one has died . i m certain that s one of the most difficult aspects of any job in law enforcement . i m perfectly fine around blood and other graphic crime scenes , and i actually find them to be really interesting , but the social aspect is what would probably deter me . i ve always loved forensics , however , so i would probably be content with being a lab person like abby from ncis .","308341":"i was born and raised in new york state .","308342":"we either split it or we take turns , i . e . he ll pay one night and i ll pay

consent to it , and she s a shitty person for doing that to him . like lakocis just said , it s ridiculous that people are laughing this off because if the tables were turned , people would be in an uproar . there s almost no coverage or talk about sxxual assault when it comes to male victims .","308351":"yes ? ? who else would it be .","308352":"listening to music affects people on emotional levels , so it s healthy to release emotions into music whether it s sadness or anger or euphoria . you can find solace in music that sometimes you can t find in other people , which in turn makes

slaps onto you there are millions of people with mental illness who are in healthy relationships , and you have the potential to be one of those people too . just because you re mentally ill doesn t mean you re unlovable , and you have so much to offer .","308359":"that a certain person is toxic to them , whether it s a friend or a family member or a significant other . we often don t realize we

t matter to my life anymore and that i shouldn t dwell on things that aren t productive for me to change . it isn t healthy to focus on the lives of people who don t enrich your life in some way because you get too caught up in other people s progress instead of your own , making comparisons to the lives of people you don t really know instead of bettering yourself . it s healthier to cut all contact in the long run .","308376":"no . usually if i have a falling out with someone , i ll unfriend them so that i don t have to see their posts on my feeds on social media . i don t have room in

subsequently took a nap until pm . afterwards , i cleaned off the cars and shoveled the driveway walkway , then i took a quick run for cigarettes and coffee . since then , i ve been fucking around on

always been talented at expressing myself through writing .","308382":"i used to experience panic attacks every day , and i only experience them perhaps one or two times per month now . they re definitely treatable if you re on a good treatment regimen , i . e . medication and therapy . therapy has helped me a lot with panic attacks as well because it s helped give me insight as to why i

i ve been writing consistently for the past month or so , which makes me really proud of myself .","308432":"i just took it now","308433":"the problem with therapy is that you have to be at a point where you re aware that you need professional help and you have to be willing to accept help , even if it s not what you had in mind . it requires an open mind . if someone isn t ready to accept help for their problems , then they won t get anything out of therapy i used to be in that position when i was a teenager . i saw a therapist when i was years old , but i refused to believe that i needed help , so i didn t get anything out of the sessions and stopped attending . it wasn t until when i realized that i severely needed professional help otherwise i was going to end up dead .","308434":"thank you ! ! i still have my slip ups here and there , as well as occasional depressive episodes , but they re not nearly as debilitating as they used to be and i can still function through my episodes until they dissipate . i always become discouraged whenever they happen , but my therapist always reminds me that i m still making improvements and my episodes will never be as disabling as they were two years ago , and i m constantly improving every week i see her .","308435":"i wholeheartedly agree ! ! like i was saying to celine , prior to taking medication , i could barely function as a human being and merely existed , even though i didn t want to exist . i ve regained my life back after getting adjusted on medication even though it took two years for me to find the right meds , haha , and i can t imagine my life without them .","308436":"i used to have the same mindset too prior to starting psychiatric medication , i was afraid of becoming dependent on them . but over the course of the past two years , with the trial and error associated with finding new meds , i ve learned that i genuinely do need certain medications in order to function on a daily basis , and there s nothing wrong with that . before i started medication , i slept for weeks . i missed work at least once per week . i couldn t leave my house . i didn t eat . i cried every day and had thoughts of svicide . and when i was at work , i couldn t focus and was prone to panic attacks . medication has helped me exponentially and it not only allows me to function at home and at work , but now i also have the motivation to take part in my hobbies .","308437":"i use askfm every day , sadly enough . you would think that after years , i would have gotten tired of this website , but here i am . . . answering questions on a daily basis .","308438":"there have been some cases where people have been classified as disabled due to such illnesses as social anxiety or clinically known

assassin s creed series .","308444":"yes , i ve been reading writing poetry since i was a teenager . i ve recently written nine poems within the past month and two short essays .","308445":"i don t

.","308446":"leigh isn t my real first name i honestly adopted leigh as my name when i was a teenager , and i ve been using it for more than a decade now . i originally came across the name while

in a hundred blankets , and my laptop to be on my lap so that i can answer questions and write for the rest of the afternoon . preferably with a candle or incense ignited .","308451":"askfm was certainly more entertaining when it was more active a few years ago , but i do enjoy the quietness of the app now . back then , you couldn t state any opinion without a million people jumping down your throat for whatever reasons they could muster , but askfm seems to be more relaxed these days .","308452":"i think sex work should be legalized in that respect , there can be better regulations regarding how sex workers are treated in the industry .","308453":"i think it s shitty for people to allege that some forms of abvse are better than others abvse is abvse regardless of whether it s emotional or physical , and they re equally as traumatizing . not all physical abvse marks heal , either . people can experience chronic illnesses due to the effects of physical abvse , especially if it s prolonged .","308454":"one of my coworkers uploaded a poem to instagram , and i told her that i liked the imagery involved in it . i encouraged her to write more often when she can because she s

?","308457":"this is probably something sexual , but i have no clue what you re talking about .","308458":"lol , no being an empath doesn t mean you re mentally ill . if someone is an empath , it means that they possess a hypersensitive ability to perceive other people s emotional state .","308459":"i m fairly empathetic , as i can understand most of the time where certain people are coming from with their struggles and thoughts . i always try to seek to understand why some people behave the way they do and hear them out .","308460":"this is inaccurate . i m not debating this any longer , though . please go debate about trans issues with someone else if you desire .","308461":"not generally , no . i m extremely guarded when it comes to trusting new people , and i generally don t become close with a person until after talking with them for a long amount of time .","308462":"mainly social media facebook , askfm , tumblr , and twitter . i ve also been trying to use medium . com more often to post my writing . everything else i use is an app on my phone instagram , curiouscat , snapchat , etc etc .","308463":"no , i didn t say or imply that at all . there s a difference between using someone for your own personal benefit and cutting toxic people out of your life .","308464":"mental stability , an apartment with my boyfriend , and a dog .","308465":"lol , yeah especially my high school self , which was stereotypical goth scene kid at its max . my writing back in the day wasn t terrible , but i ve definitely matured since then .","308466":"just be yourself and the right person will show up naturally over time . you can t force anyone to be with you , so your best option is to just keep living your life to the best of your ability and the right person will come along .","308467":"this is a question that probably has a lot to do with evolution and psychology , and i don t really feel like wracking my brain to come to an abstract conclusion rn .","308468":"hell bent on war and destruction , by the way things seem to be going .","308469":"i think it s still being studied , but this is based off of a preliminary google search you d probably

isn t going to make it happen , so i ve always actively worked for what i wanted in my life .","308471":"no . i m educated in a lot of different things , but i wouldn t consider myself to be a master

exactly sober rn , which probably helps lol .","308473":"i think so , yeah sometimes people are better off as friends as opposed to lovers , which tends to happen a lot . my first girlfriend and i are better off as friends .","308474":"uh , yeah if you have to ask is this racist . . . then of the time it s racist .","308475":"of course crying is a natural human reaction to stimuli , and it doesn t make anyone less of a man for crying . it simply means you re human . we need to get rid of this concept of toxic masculinity because all it does is persuade men to suppress their emotions , and that isn t healthy at all .","308476":"he s an extremely messy person , and our concepts of clean are two completely different entities . he ll clean his room one day , and the next day , it somehow is a mess again . i have no idea how he does it tbh . he s an organized person in his mind , but his living areas are always a wreck .","308477":"my discovery of watsky k . flay on youtube i first listened

again .","308486":"honestly . . . the only famous figure i would like to meet would be chester bennington . he isn t historic by any means , but he s the person who has been the most meaningful in my life , and i always wanted to tell him the substantial influence he had on my life .","308487":"it isn t that , my job couldn t care less about what people do in their free time because they don t

probably should have specified longer dicks , as opposed to shorter ones with more girth .","308496":"the best feeling is the first sip of coffee first drag of a cigarette in the morning .","308497":"i think it works both ways for both males and females porn gives unrealistic expectations to both sexes . for women , it gives off the impression that big dicks more pleasure , while for men , it gives off the impression that tight vaginas a lesser experienced woman . both couldn t be further from the truth .","308498":"obvious inquiries such as asking where a person lives , their phone number , their real name , their work place , their friends , etc etc . i also find that , with respect to askfm , a lot of anons don t understand the concept of privacy so they ll ask invasive sexual questions . a lot of anons feel entitled to know private details about a person s history .","308499":"remember that your mental illnesses do not define you , and you re still a complete whole person regardless of your mental states you deserve to find someone who loves and cherishes you , even if you may think otherwise . it s obviously also important to find a person who s understanding of mental health issues , so if you re dating a person who clearly doesn t understand your illnesses , you re better off dropping them .","308500":"tbh , i remember askfm being at its peak around . i used to get questions per day , to the point where it overwhelmed me so much that i had to deactivate my account for one year .","308501":"i m proficient at doing repetitive jobs , but they obviously bore me and i ll get tired of them rather quickly . i prefer changes in my routine to keep things diverse and interesting .","308502":"tbh it s a bit hypocritical to claim that they respect the lgbt

exactly divided up into cliques we obviously had people who were in advanced classes and were into sports , but most people s interests intersected . it wasn t unheard of for someone to be a quiet individual , be in advanced classes , and also be proficient in sports .","308505":"i haven t been online much at all today besides for the past hour i logged onto my laptop to answer questions faster since i got a lot of questions since last night . but , it is rather inactive on this side of askfm in general especially compared to one year ago .","308506":"i never got detention when i was in high

you truly love a person , telling them that you love them never loses its meaning . you should never get so comfortable that you forego telling your partner that you love them and cherish your relationship .","308513":"i assume you meant wouldn t but either way , that isn t necessarily true . you can be het and date a trans person if one person is a man and the other is a woman , regardless

their own agenda .","308517":"a concept i have similar views to my friends because one perspective isn t shared by only one person . cc shehitsback","308518":"idk , all of the americans i know absolutely hate the status of this country , including myself .","308519":"good luck and stay warm ! ! my favorite kind of weather is spring weather not too warm with a nice breeze . i also like grey , rainy days .","308520":"there s no snow where i live . we re supposed to get a lot of rain over the next two days , though .","308521":"a week long vacation with my boyfriend where we do nothing but sleep , have coffee , walk around nature parks and quaint towns , and sleep some more . no responsibilities or worries .","308522":"my teenage years were the most difficult for me because i was dealing with abvse , the natural act of getting older , depression and anxiety , and addiction .","308523":"i think it s extremely active in countries other than the united states , but i agree that the activity has dwindled a lot since one year ago .","308524":"i ll be in five years , so hopefully i ll be living in an apartment or house with my boyfriend and be married with a lot of dogs .","308525":"i am unfortunately still active , haha .","308526":"a dog i miss having a dog to play with and comfort me , but my parents aren t too keen on the idea after our last dog passed away . it s why i m looking forward to moving out of my parents house , besides the obvious fact of being independent . i think having a pet will help me a lot with my emotional issues .","308527":"usually i buy something for myself , like one of my favorite iced coffees or i ll get my nails done . i also have gotten into the habit of doing face masks , which makes my skin feel fresh and smooth .","308528":"i give off the impression that i m relatively stable , but i ve been a wild and out of control mess for the past few weeks and i feel like i ve lost control of myself . i like talking about mental health , but i seldom talk about my own mental health because it s difficult to explain and my behavior is so misunderstood and stigmatized that its not even worth it sometimes for me to explain . i might take it easy for a while . i m not sure yet . but it s wrecking havoc on my relationships and i ve been self isolating and things need to change .","308529":"the princess bride if that s considered an old movie . it recently turned years old .","308530":"i have the tendency to be jealous , but i ve been trying hard to suppress those feelings . i usually make passive aggressive comments or , if i m really angry , i ll confront the person directly .","308531":"are you fucking kidding me ? it s my automatic reaction to a lot of circumstances .","308532":"waking up with my boyfriend to a view overlooking the mountains , having coffee on the patio , and making meaningful conversation .","308533":"i like surrealism , like salvador dali . i have one of his prints hanging in my room .","308534":"do you mean dying ? i assume everyone would ideally want to die fast .","308535":"probably one of those tattoo shows where people get filmed while getting their tattoos and talking about the significance behind them . i ve been meaning to get a new tattoo for a while .","308536":"i m exhausted and i have a splitting headache . i honestly don t want to be at work right now , and i m looking forward to going home in six hours and watching the rest of the end of the fucking world .","308537":"crying is extremely healthy for anyone it s a release of emotional stress and it also triggers the release of endorphins , the feel good chemicals , into your bloodstream .","308538":"sometimes , yeah however , it s more of an uncontrollable emotional response than anything else .","308539":"i m not a girl that s probably the most significant difference .","308540":"dunkin donuts vanilla iced coffee . would recommend .","308541":"sometime last week . i don t remember when or for what reason , but it s a common occurrence .","308542":"as long as they re babies , i see nothing wrong with that . however , if they re older then there s pressure for the kids to look a certain way and that can be detrimental to their self image .","308543":"yes . i ve always been a hard worker , especially when it came to school work , so i knew i was going to graduate with high honors .","308544":"i love linkin park and tbh i think that song has been equated with chester s death so it has significant meaning .","308545":"it was cute the first time i saw it , but now that i ve seen you ask this to nearly everyone i follow , it s rather irritating .","308546":"guess who s hanging out with courrtana on sunday aaaahhhhh .","308547":"my relationship with my boyfriend . he s my solid support system and i can t imagine not having him in my life .","308548":"my current job writing and editing . i ve been doing it for my entire life , so it comes naturally to me .","308549":"answering questions is addictive , at the very least . it gives me something to do when i m bored or taking a break . i also follow quite a few friends of mine , and i enjoy reading their answers .","308550":"i m not sober rn and it took me three times to figure out what this meant , lmao .","308551":"no . traditions are often exposed to be wrong or outdated , and modern science has proven that there are better alternatives and can uncover new evidence . there are a lot of misconceptions about circumcision and it isn t as great as people thought it was in the past .","308552":"chocolate chip cookie dough ! !","308553":"writing poetry again it s been years since i wrote anything , but a week or so ago , i started writing again and currently have eight poems drafted .","308554":"if i had an option , i d rather jump from a springboard . i used to love jumping off of diving boards into pools all the time .","308555":"thankfully , never . i m seldom in a public place where men have the option to flirt with me , and even when i am out i . e . at the bar , people rarely approach me . i m the type of person who saves their friends from disgusting men by telling them off if they approach them .","308556":"they ve gone through some terrible experiences , but has still managed to survive to tell their tales . i find this person interesting because we get along quite well and i find their openness about their illnesses to be refreshing and educational . i think we would be great friends irl .","308557":"circumcision it s an unnecessary and painful cosmetic procedure done on infants without their consent . hunting as a sport i don t believe in killing , maiming , or injuring animals as a form of entertainment because it s incredibly cruel .","308558":"i don t feel compelled to have children at this point in my life . it would be irresponsible of me to do such a thing .","308559":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company . i mainly write press releases , newsletter and magazine features , and biographies for websites . i also proofread and edit narratives that the other writers wrote .","308560":"i have no tolerance for pro life propaganda on my page . if someone wants to have an abortion , they should have the freedom to do such . to infringe on someone s decision to do what is necessary for their health is an invasion of bodily autonomy .","308561":"lol . that s certainly an interesting way to look at it . i think there s a difference between someone who s your therapist and someone who s your friend your therapist is supposed to listen to your thoughts , feelings , experiences and give professional advice on how to cope with them , as well as make you view things in a different perspective . they went to school and studied mental illnesses so they have a clinical understanding of what people go through . friends aren t professionals and can only offer lay people advice and hope for the best . while you can tell your friends some of the things you go through , there s always the possibility of them judging you or telling someone else .","308562":"i ve always been hesitant with the idea of wanting children , so i often go back and forth on it . some days i can see myself as a parent , while other days i want nothing to do with kids and find them annoying .","308563":"hell no . i don t particularly like children , and i literally have no idea what to do with babies . i ve never experienced baby fever before .","308564":"i think they would learn more about mental health and that complex disorders aren t scary it would promote understanding of things such as personality disorders and erase some of the stigma associated with them .","308565":"as long as those charges are discussed prior to signing the contract and the buyer is fully aware of those charges , then i don t really see a problem with that except for hidden charges , that s just a problem . i see nothing wrong with an exit penalty if you end a contract early because you were the one who originally agreed to the contract to its entirety .","308566":"idk actually . sometimes parents need to bring their children with them because they have no other option , and that wouldn t really be fair to those parents . on the other hand , i think it would be interesting to have mature restaurants where you have to be a certain age to eat there , and sometimes it s nice not to hear screaming children during dinner , lol .","308567":"there was one night a few weeks ago where my boyfriend and i stayed up talking until am . we were just having one of those nights where the conversation just flowed and they were all deep and productive conversations , and it felt so nice to have someone to talk to like that . i felt so grateful that person just happens to be my significant other .","308568":"no i agree with what pretty much everyone else has said regarding this matter . it s unfair to tip toe around people s diets or give them special consideration because no one is inherently a better person than another simply because they re vegetarian vegan . i do believe there should be more vegan options in restaurants , but other than that , i don t really think we should be more mindful than we already are .","308569":"yeah , absolutely we have no secrets between us , and tbh if i woke up in another person s bed , i would assume that i was assaulted because i would never consent to activity with another person .","308570":"i m not a girl , and i really hope this isn t the anon who keeps insisting that i m a girl despite me saying otherwise . nevertheless , i m good . i m drinking wine and having a good time listening to music .","308571":"askfm is fucking dead tonight , man .","308572":"it shouldn t be unless they re doing something illegal .","308573":"not with strangers , no . but i ve known my boyfriend s best friend for seven years , so of course i m going to feel comfortable around him .","308574":"the barista at starbucks accidentally knocked over a cup of coffee and like a millimeter splashed onto this customer s jacket , so the customer threw a fit because apparently it was a insert expensive brand here . i grabbed my drink and ran . i have no patience for people like that .","308575":"yes , we plan on getting married we re not engaged or anything yet , but it s pretty much a mutual understanding and he s probably going to propose to me after we get settled into an apartment together .","308576":"donald j . trump .","308577":"despite feeling like shit both physically mentally , i ve managed to clean , dust , vacuum , and do laundry and its only pm . even though this is little stuff , i m still proud of myself .","308578":"lol . i ask him occasionally how he feels about it , and he literally says i don t give a shit . do whatever you want with your body , i ll still love you either way . i haven t shaved since at least november or december , and i normally go months without shaving in general if it bothered him , we would have broken up years ago .","308579":"oh hell no . waxing my eyebrows hurts enough , i can t imagine waxing other portions of my body .","308580":"nah , i don t have a preference i love all dogs and will probably adopt one that i feel a chemistry who does melt my heart although all dogs melt my heart lol .","308581":"i don t think everyone is dangerous or threatens people regardless , idk why you re still carrying on about this . an anon came to me for help with someone who they perceived to be dangerous with a history of threatening behavior . i gave them advice . end of story . all other inquiries will be deleted .","308582":"move into an apartment with my boyfriend lose weight progress further with my career recover more from mental health adopt a dog","308583":"idk why this is still a topic of conversation . the original anon who told me about him basically said they feared for their life , so i referred her to the police and the fbi . that s not unreasonable . you should always report potentially dangerous behavior .","308584":"lol i m literally wearing one of his shirts rn . yeah , they re cozy and a bit bigger than my clothes so they hang loosely which is comfortable to me .","308585":"red flag behavior is still red flag behavior regardless of whether or not someone has a mental illness mental illness isn t an excuse for abvsive behavior .","308586":"i haven t done any research on it , so i can t agree or disagree with this notion . there s also the concept that there s less stigma surrounding disorders such as depression and anxiety , so people are more apt to seek professional help , which makes it appear as if more people have mental illness than in the past .","308587":"lmao . thanks for the humor , anon .","308588":"that is interesting . but yeah , i can see where she s coming from bpd is a chronic illness and while we can recover to the point of stability , it s still always there . we can treat the symptoms of the disorder , but that doesn t necessarily mean that the disorder goes away .","308589":". . . did you really believe that sending an anon message would really persuade me to quit smoking ? ? lmao . my choices are mine to make . i have no intentions of quitting anytime soon , so any attempts to sway me otherwise are pointless .","308590":"lol . that s my secret i m always anon . cc lakocis","308591":"i like walking through parks and wooded areas to take photographs . i believe that nature is beautiful and i absolutely love photographing landscapes and other interesting forms to showcase that beauty .","308592":"this question is better geared toward google .","308593":"i know what you mean , it honestly scares me too even though i m not in school anymore but the idea of anyone having free range in any public , crowded place is terrifying and it s almost as if no one is safe .","308594":"i don t think pathetic is the right word to use moreso alarming than anything else . but i agree . idk why the police aren t taking that person s case seriously . it s damaging .","308595":"i prefer pumpkin bread , although that s more of a thanksgiving thing where i m from .","308596":"yes , definitely i need to be with someone with whom i can have deep conversations , which requires a bit of intelligence . luckily my boyfriend is intelligent in his own right , even though he doesn t believe it himself .","308597":"lol the other day . i accidentally deleted a narrative from one of the folders before proofreading it , so i told the writer uhhh i can t find it in the folder , do you have a copy saved on your computer ? and luckily he did .","308598":"i personally wouldn t engage in such activities especially considering i have a boyfriend , but it doesn t affect me if other people have friends with benefits . people are allowed to live their lives however they choose , and it isn t my place to judge .","308599":"my boyfriend , lol . he s legit the weirdest person i ve ever met , but that s why i love him .","308600":"at times , yes . lately i ve been dealing with it because everyone talking about gun control has been so emotionally draining on me and its been overwhelming me a lot . i can only read so much before my head starts to spin .","308601":"i m back and forth on the whole parenting deal because i ve never really liked children and i don t have any sort of parental instinct . however , if i do have kids one day , i won t raise them like how i was raised and i would probably try to teach them a little bit about every religion to show them that they can adhere to whatever beliefs make the most sense to them .","308602":"uh , awks","308603":"tbh it s entirely due to therapy i ve been in therapy for more than one year now , and i ve learned a lot about my mental health and symptoms and behavior as a result . i can control some things , and some things i can t , but i m grateful that i m aware of things moreso now than ever before .","308604":"if someone threatens me , then i usually tell them off quite calmly . so far , i ve never had anyone push further than verbal threats , so i ve never had a reason to defend myself . if it happens , though , i m confident that i can defend myself . i carry a knife with me everywhere i go .","308605":"most likely , yeah most parents do it everyday .","308606":"no , i ve never been arrested . probably should have been quite a few times , but i got lucky .","308607":"idk , my boyfriend says i am and kids love me for some reason , but i feel really awkward around them .","308608":"my relationships . i m emotionally dependent on certain people and cling to their moods feelings , which isn t good necessarily because that means that their emotions affect mine , usually in a negative manner .","308609":"i think that would be interesting it would definitely make it more diverse , especially considering sometimes i feel awkward liking a post if that post is sad or depressing in a way . i want to acknowledge that i saw it understand their feelings , but i also don t want to give off the impression that i like their pain , lol .","308610":"heathers starting winona ryder it s one of my favorite movies a comfort film for me . i am not a serial killer is also a really good movie .","308611":"so many that i wouldn t be able to list them all . my favorites are peaches and raspberries , though .","308612":"not to mention that there s a high risk of copycat crimes that are committed after such an ordeal . people who already have unstable and homicidal thoughts are more apt to act on them after publicity arises regarding other killers , it provides them with validation .","308613":"i wouldn t say any of my hobbies or habits are odd or interesting . the most unconventional habit i have is anxious skin picking which has resulted in a lot of cuts and scars all over my arms .","308614":"this week has been ridiculously slow , and i can t believe it s only thursday . i m so mentally done with this week and the weekend can t come soon enough . i couldn t focus on work all day yesterday , and i have a feeling that today is going to be the same way .","308615":"from my understanding , they re not their friend , and you clearly didn t read about the threatening and dangerous things they were doing which warranted a police investigation .","308616":"jesus . please stay safe this is a dangerous person apparently , and keep reporting him if he does anything else .","308617":"i m almost tempted to tell you to report that to authorities . that s really threatening behavior and a red flag for these exact things .","308618":"i haven t heard anyone say this personally , but that is alarming and extremely sickening . he s an adult who committed mass murder , not someone who deserves sympathy .","308619":"i can t say whether or not it classifies as a mental illness , but there is such a thing as seasonal affective disorder however , it usually refers to people feeling depressed during the winter months and more upbeat during the summer months . if your symptoms are interfering with your life , though , i would highly suggest you see a doctor .","308620":"lol . this is probably one of the most amusing statements i ve been sent on askfm . thanks for the laugh .","308621":"of course our hearts ache when we experience any kind of loss , whether it s a relationship or a friendship or a death of a loved one . sometimes our hearts ache on behalf of other people who are experiencing loss as well .","308622":"i think they would be indifferent . i m an adult so it isn t really out of the ordinary for some people to refer to their parents by their first names , especially if they don t have a close relationship .","308623":"regardless of someone s gender , a person should be able to make their own independent decisions in a healthy relationship . if someone is suggesting something , then sometimes it s good to take their opinion into consideration , but if they re demanding , then that s abvse .","308624":"i enjoy ig videos , so i don t see any cons to it . it s nice to be able to see insights into people s everyday lives via video .","308625":"most of the time , you can t sometimes our hardships are out of our control . however , you can change the way you react to these situations and develop healthier coping mechanisms to better deal with hardships in your life .","308626":"i m not in the mood to entertain childish notions . good bye .","308627":"a teenager is literally a child . stop worrying about sex and focus on school .","308628":"lol , oh goodness . if you re a child , then you have better things to worry about than sex . go study .","308629":"virginity is a social construct and doesn t actually exist on a physical scale . people cannot lose something that has never physically existed , especially as the hymen can tear years prior to a person having sex for the first time . in addition , the concept of losing one s virginity can be complex , especially in regards to victims of sexual assault . not only is it an inappropriate question , but it can be disrespectful to people who have struggled with assault in the past .","308630":"i don t follow fake accounts or people begging for likes .","308631":". . . i have no idea what this is asking .","308632":"that s not for me to decide .","308633":"to be objective means to view a situation from am unbiased perspective , taking in multiple points of view to look at all angles of an event . i believe that humans are capable of viewing things objectively , but we do ultimately form opinions on things .","308634":"dissociative amnesia is a breakdown of memory or identity that often causes a person to have no recollection of large portions of their life . as someone with dissociative amnesia , it s very problematic in my life because it means i don t remember the first years of my life so i ve lost time with respect to growing up and developing a sense of identity .","308635":"i m always open to constructive criticism , especially when it comes to my writing . the only way to get better is to continuously improve yourself .","308636":"yes , i m planning on moving in with my boyfriend ! !","308637":"both , in a weird sense . i mostly have control over my life , but there are times where i feel out of control when my mental illnesses act up where i m just gliding along with no real purpose or intention . it can be frustrating .","308638":"this reminds me of donnie darko i honestly don t know anything about wormholes , so i don t have an opinion .","308639":"bro , i have half pink hair half of my head is shaved clean . i don t care about looking unconventional .","308640":"literature . even after someone passes , their words live on within the pages of their novels . i think that s why i ve always been attracted to writing in general even after i die , i ll leave behind my thoughts feelings .","308641":"i personally believe that we create our own purpose nothing is bestowed upon us when we re born . we simply find something we re passionate about and make a life that brings out the most joy within us .","308642":"oh jeez obviously if you re close to a disabled person and they don t mind that you poke a little fun , it s completely different than a complete stranger making fun of a disability . it s common sense .","308643":"disabled jokes are usually jokes made about disabled people to their expense the only justifiable reason behind them is if the disabled person themselves are making those jokes . the way the original anon phrased gave me the impression that they were referring to cruel jokes .","308644":"usually because they re heartless and immature with no real understanding of disability .","308645":"no , it isn t . it s on hulu , though ! ! i ve been mooching off of my friend s account just to watch it , lol .","308646":"i wrote a new poem today , which makes me happy they re getting more personal tbh i m discovering a lot about my pent up anger and uncovered feelings through writing these recent poems . it s therapeutic .","308647":"i don t necessarily think they need more , they just want more for security purposes .","308648":"i need a new contouring kit but all of the good ones are at least , and i can t justify spending that kind of money on one item that i ll only seldom use .","308649":"i know a lot of people who are blunt , so it isn t really anything out of the ordinary to me i m a blunt person myself . it isn t an admirable quality but it isn t a bad quality to have either .","308650":"somewhat , yes . however , they re all things that i ve achieved on my own so it s moreso having to do with pride than gratitude . i m the one who found my relationship with my boyfriend well he did too , lol , i m the one who worked hard through college to get a good job , and i m the one who sought out mental health treatment to better my life .","308651":"lol that is a pretty ableist thing to say . i know plenty of people who are mentally ill and own firearms and are responsible with them . however , i do agree that there should be stricter regulations into purchasing a firearm , and such assault rifles as the ar shouldn t be made for the public .","308652":"this question is better geared toward shehitsback , she s quite open about her schizophrenia diagnosis .","308653":"like , biting the inside of my cheeks ? if so , then yeah .","308654":"lol , no . there isn t anyone i hate . hate is a strong word only reserved to particular people in my life .","308655":"of course they are what else does an anon have to do in their spare time ?","308656":"it isn t always guaranteed that i ll have a hangover most of the time i don t , tbh . either way , i like drinking alcohol and it doesn t matter much to me how i may or may not feel the next day .","308657":"when it comes to my medication and mood , it doesn t . that doesn t mean it doesn t affect my sleep or whether or not i have a hangover the next day , lol .","308658":"no he s entitled to his opinion . i would ask him why he doesn t like that friend of mine to see whether or not he simply disagrees with their viewpoints or he doesn t trust their intentions with me , though . he s usually a good judge of character so i ll always take his feelings into consideration .","308659":"hey guys , i posted a new poem to my poetry page so i d appreciate it if you wanted to check it out ! ! http instagram . com poetamortem","308660":"yes i had strict deadlines with my last job , but this job doesn t give my deadlines so i usually set deadlines for myself i . e . proofreading four narratives per hour , or writing two narratives per hour . it helps me focus on my work .","308661":"if i m being honest , then not really but i ll be fine eventually . i m just having a rough day and hopefully it will get better soon . i m trying to distract myself in the meantime .","308662":"askfm has certain buzzwords that causes them to delete questions answers automatically if they find that they re inappropriate . i m always careful so i always censor words like abvse or rvpe and other words along those lines .","308663":"i support the me too movement because it s brought to light a lot of abvse that has occurred in not only the entertainment industry , but also in ordinary people s everyday lives people feel more comfortable calling out their abvsers . the only concern i have are false accusations , because there s always the possibility of people falsely accusing someone of abvsing them just to garner attention . while the chance of this happening is slim , and i believe we should always take survivors seriously , there s always that possibility and that unsettles me .","308664":"do you mean coloring books ? if so , then yeah they don t really do anything therapeutic for me , but they can be relaxing . i always lose interest before i finish a page , though .","308665":"i ve never watched the movies or read the books , and tbh i have no intentions of doing so . from my understanding , they fetishize and normalize abvsive relationships and isn t a proper model of what a bdsm relationship actually is .","308666":"i wouldn t say madly because we ve far surpassed the honeymoon stage of our relationship , but i am in love with someone .","308667":"being mentally ill doesn t excuse or justify someone s actions when it comes to committing mvrder . people who are mentally ill are more likely to be victims of violence rather than the perpetrator themselves . he was a white supremacist with a clear fascination with guns and killing , and the government didn t do their job at preventing this tragedy from occurring . he was tipped off to the fbi numerous times because of his online activity and it was never followed through .","308668":"no , they re two somewhat different entities . delusions aren t the same thing as exhibiting paranoia , and sometimes a person s paranoia can be justified .","308669":"no , not really . getting this far was an actual surprise to me , i never really expected to have a good , stable job or a treatment plan that works for me .","308670":"this isn t the first time i ve received a response like this and i m not entertaining it .","308671":"probably sometime last week when my boyfriend and i fell asleep while high and slept for about hours straight .","308672":"i like most of her songs when she s singing rapping by herself i m actually listening to a playlist of all of her original songs rn . my favorite ones are probably we hate everyone , high enough , and run for your life .","308673":"aw lol thank you . idk i usually get my inspiration from my own experiences and feelings i feel the incredible need to tell my story and i ve always done that through writing , whether it s poetry or prose .","308674":"yes mental illness holds such a stigma in society and people are automatically labeled as manipulative or violent simply because they re mentally ill .","308675":"it s something i m hesitant about , because i m not really good with kids and i ve never had that parental instinct . things may change in the future , though .","308676":"sorta , but i m not a scientist so i don t really know the details of climate change or whether or not what we ve done can be reversed .","308677":"i used to absolutely love that song when it first came out it was the inspiration for one of my short stories when i was a teenager , actually .","308678":"no , it doesn t affect my mental health . it alarms me at times that it seems as if our government doesn t care about the climate , but it doesn t make me depressed .","308679":"absolutely . it s universally accepted by the scientific community that climate change is a real problem and its only going to get worse .","308680":"lol , i know right ? if you re going to attempt to insult me , at least don t be afraid to spell the words out .","308681":". i was mortified . but again , i didn t get any points on my license so i guess it was worth it .","308682":"no , i m not able to do such a thing .","308683":"i m shook . what am i going to do after being burned like this ?","308684":"it s going fine . i picked up coffee this morning and spent the morning early afternoon browsing the internet on my laptop and listening to music . i also did my makeup and tried taking a few photos of my hair . later tonight , i m seeing my boyfriend so that should be fun .","308685":"people seek out drugs to cope with feelings such as loneliness . it doesn t exist on the same spectrum .","308686":"of course

writing poetry . i m passionate about writing , but i haven t found the motivation to write creatively in a very long time . however , this past week , i ve been inspired to begin writing poetry again

.","308691":"my first instinct is to say yes if you truly love or care about that person , then you wouldn t feel compelled to change their personality . granted , everyone has aspects of their personality which aren t positive , and we should work on amending those , but to purposely try to change who a person is can generally be a bad thing .","308692":"hello there nothing very much just drinking watching the x files .","308693":"why not both ? one of the best feelings in the world is being wrapped in a large hoodie or blanket and holding a hot cup of coffee tea . preferably while

, but it didn t work for some reason .","308700":"if there are more bad moments than good moments , you may have to sit down and re evaluate your relationship . moving in together is a big step , and sometimes relationships don t work out because the people realize they conflict too much over intimate matters around the household .","308701":"re answering to post clearer pictures . i shaved my head ! !","308702":"abandonment .","308703":"i used to exercise with my best friend , but our schedules ended up conflicting too much so we stopped going . we ve been meaning to go back , but either one of us is sick and now she got into a nasty car accident , so i don t think it s happening anytime soon , lol . it didn t help with my mental health , but being physically active is always good .","308704":"probably . i don t post anything problematic , though , so i m not too concerned .","308705":"no , not every day . it s one of those things i constantly forget to do . i need to get better at remembering , it s a good thing to do for dental hygiene .","308706":"i suppose technically , yes ? i brush my teeth and use mouthwash every morning . i don t drink every night , though .","308707":"there s a big community on instagram dedicated to poetry , so i figured it would be the best medium to reach a larger audience .","308708":"our relationship has never dulled or soured , which i suppose is a very good thing . although we ve been together for many years , we ve never run out of things to talk about and our relationship is based off of years of close friendship where we re comfortable with one another .","308709":"dark , self depracating , and awkward .","308710":"there was a time when my friends and i were partying , and we ended up crashing in a random motel room on the highway . the paint was peeling , there were mirrors on the walls and ceiling , and the tv didn t work . it didn t much matter to us because all we wanted to do was sleep , but it was pretty low by conventional standards .","308711":"it s unfortunately become commonplace , which is a terrifying notion in itself . it s gotten to the point where schools have drills in preparation for school shootings , because it can literally happen anywhere at any time . it s a sad truth . and they re becoming more and more frequent because nothing is being done to solve the reasons why they happen in the first place .","308712":"if you read my profile , you would see that i m non binary . regardless , my day is going fine . i uploaded my first poem to my new instagram account , and people are

situations and invest myself too emotionally into people .","308715":"cigarettes , beer , and my boyfriend . because , you know , priorities .","308716":"i think people s personal businesses are

to sit there and rationalize it to myself i usually have good self control so i have enough time to tell myself that there are repurcussions to my actions and i ll regret them the next day . that s

weekdays when i have work the next day .","308724":"no , i don t do any of those things when i m drunk . i m just simply in a better mood , a bit louder than usual , more daring , and not afraid of

shaped me into the person i am today i believe that we get shaped in small ways by every situation we encounter . while obviously bigger dilemmas and traumas shape us more dramatically , the small situations do as well , and we may not notice the effects right away .","308728":"i would hope that the date doesn t exist and that my friends were playing a prank on me , because i m already in a monogamous relationship and have no interest in dating anyone else .","308729":"no , i generally don t like pancakes . i prefer waffles but if i have a choice as to any breakfast item , i ll pick omelettes every time .","308730":"yeah , i would especially with respect to the whole threat to society part . they re still a pedophile , and i wouldn t trust them around children regardless of how much help they re getting . there s always the possibility of relapse , and thoughts like those never truly go away if they exist in the first place .","308731":"i think hunting as a sport is

think i cherish anything as much as i cherish coffee .","308740":"i m protective of mental health rights raising awareness of mental illnesses to erase stigmas associated with them . when people criticize those with mental health issues , i get very protective defensive because it s something that s obviously close to me and there should be more understanding universally that mental illnesses are medical problems , just like any physical illness .","308741":"it doesn t mean anything to me i just like photographs that look dirty gritty , and i luckily found an app where i can edit my photos

of progress that needs to be made , but it s hopefully headed in the right direction .","308749":"i m not going to continue answering is it racist . . . questions because it gets redundant . if you have any doubts whether or not something is racist , it s most likely racist .","308750":"if you re a child or elderly , then personally i believe it is because children haven t developed a strong immune system yet and the elderly are most susceptible to disease .","308751":"that s what usually happens during this time of year , especially with how erratic the weather has been lately . also , more people are coming down with the flu because the flu shot this year didn t cover the strain that s going around , and some people are considering it to be an epidemic .","308752":"february has been all right thus far the only notable thing that has happened is that i ve been sick , and i m still getting over it and probably will be for the next week or so . other than that , nothing much has happened . i went out with a friend last week , i ve been seeing my boyfriend regularly , and admittedly i ve been giving into my impulses a bit too much lately , which i have to regain control .","308753":"i usually have cups of coffee and cups of tea per day . i ll have my morning coffee to wake me up and another coffee around lunch to keep me going . sometimes i ll make a third cup of coffee around pm when i get home from work , but usually i just end up making tea , depending on my mood .","308754":"me too . my previous bitmoji didn t look anything like me , but since they updated the app with new features , you can really customize literally everything , and its so fascinating .","308755":"aww , thank you ! ! i m low key obsessed with it , rofl .","308756":"no , the definition of one who is centrist is that their political beliefs fall between liberal and conservative . they may share some conservative beliefs , but they may also share liberal beliefs as well , depending on the issue .","308757":"it isn t unheard of , but it s definitely not as common since most lgbt people are left leaning . however , there are some notable conservatives who are lgbt , i . e . caitlyn

look , so it isn t like this is an abnormal mode of thinking .","308761":"i think it s a bit concerning that you re so well versed in the shape of my face to begin with . regardless , it s just a cartoon character it doesn t have to resemble me .","308762":"the cost of living is too high compared to the amount of money a person makes with their salary minimum wage hasn t adjusted according to inflation , which results in a lot of people needing to work jobs just to survive .","308763":"i m quite confused as to how my bitmoji isn t honest in the first place .","308764":"well i m not doing the same things today as i was yesterday , so technically , i am different , yes .","308765":"my boyfriend and i might get sushi delivered and spend the night watching movies . we always have low key

diagnosed with clinical depression , unfortunately .","308769":"yes askfm , like many other social media sites , will eventually dissipate as new networks arise over time . i anticipate that what happened with formspring will happen with askfm as well .","308770":"i didn t really do much over the summer besides work a lot there was one weekend where i went to the beach with my best friend , but it was bittersweet because it was a day or two after chester bennington s death so we listened to his music the entire afternoon .","308771":"my dna makeup .","308772":"as far as i m aware , taking a break with someone you were previously in a relationship with pretty much means you re broken up with the slim chance of getting back together in the future . if you re in the middle of a break and have a one night stand , i don t personally think it s cheating . after all , you re broken up with that person you were previously dating . regardless of how you want to spin it , going on a break insinuates that you ve broken up temporarily , regardless of what the future holds .","308773":"no ? ? catfishing is when you pretend to be someone else in a long distance relationship friendship , i . e . using someone else s photos . if you re uncomfortable showing your boyfriend what you look like without makeup , then you re not catfishing , you re just insecure .","308774":"yeah , i think that would be the best thing to do it doesn t necessarily mean that the profile is active , but she should at least be aware of what you found so she can discuss it with her boyfriend .","308775":"hey friends , i m bored rn on my laptop , so you should ask me questions . ask me about mental health my illnesses my career education my relationships friendships my hobbies , i . e . art , writing , video games tv shows movies politics social activism anything else you can think of ! ! i don t answer sexual questions , so any questions regarding sex will be deleted","308776":"preparing taxes , setting up appointments with the mechanic and trying to describe the problem lmao , finding new doctors who take your insurance , dealing with insurance companies when they decide not to cover your medication , etc etc . i think it s a bit ridiculous that most people just find themselves in adult situations when we ve mostly had no preparation for adulthood whatsoever . high schools should really have a class that teaches you how to balance a checkbook , prepare your taxes , take out a loan or transfer bank accounts , and other valuable information .","308777":"i can t really think of any events that have happened lately which have turned out to be significant . my life is pretty boring tbh , and i do the same things week after week . i m getting my hair colored shaved next week , if that counts for anything .","308778":"there are a lot of celebrities who have been born on long island , but none from my particular town to my knowledge .","308779":"raspberries , blueberries , cherries , and peaches .","308780":"it isn t so much the relationship itself , but it s the support i receive from my boyfriend which has validated me and helped me stabilize myself somewhat . if i m ever in a crisis or having a bad day or slipping into an episode , then i can trust him to say the right things and do what s best for me .","308781":"yes , i already have friends with different opinions than the ones i hold . it s possible to co exist with people and have civil discussions , even if you don t necessarily agree with some of their opinions .","308782":". . . alcohol doesn t stay in your system for that long , lmao . trust me my alcohol consumption is perfectly fine , and there s no need for you to worry .","308783":"where did i

battlegrounds he s a type diabetic he has ptsd and has had depression in the past he s passionate about animals he s cuban and speaks spanish","308785":"i don t have any plans for the night except

fahrenheit .","308787":"i m always honest , so there s no point in me doing an honesty hour . i also don t answer sexual questions .","308788":"ideally , i would love to move down south to the carolinas or virginias . the cost of living is much cheaper there compared to where i live now , and my boyfriend and i would both be able to find jobs there easily enough .","308789":"i always want questions , haha . they re a good way to pass the time .","308790":"story of my life , tbh .","308791":"ahh , i can t imagine that . i m not like that at all tbh , once i cut someone out they re completely gone to me i don t even give them a second thought . they become a number to me , not necessarily a person .","308792":"everyone uses words to refer to themselves in the first person perspective because that s how we re taught to speak . people don t refer to themselves in the third person .","308793":"sometimes , but it comes and goes in phases , and it depends entirely upon the interests of those around me .","308794":"no ? ? those are just words used to refer to myself . it has absolutely nothing to do with my interests or my personality .","308795":"it depends on the vibe i get from the account , to be honest there are some people who use pseudonyms and don t upload photos of themselves , and they re not fake at all . they re just protecting their identity . however , i ve also run into plenty of other users who are clearly fake .","308796":"i m not really in a clique on askfm . i m my own individual . i d be interested to see if anyone groups me with any other users , though ! !","308797":"idk , it s something i ve always contemplated , but never found an answer . i have friends who have had experiences and have some of an idea of some possibility of life after death , but i m not convinced myself .","308798":". . . what the hell is this nonsense .","308799":"lmao , no . the only hats i wear are beanies in the winter .","308800":"i m constantly faking at least some parts of myself in order to get by faking happiness so that others aren t concerned for my well being , faking stability so that i can survive the day , or faking wellness so that i can convince myself that i m not sick . sometimes it s moreso an attempt to convince myself than other people . sometimes i m convinced that my whole persona is fake and the real me got lost among the chaos .","308801":"i personally don t think so . i haven t done anything amazing with my life thus far , and i don t currently do anything that would necessarily inspire or influence other people .","308802":"i was never called into the principal s office when i was a child . the only related scenario that has happened was that someone wrote a death threat on a desk i usually sat in , so i was questioned by the police one afternoon . nothing came of it .","308803":"i usually feel comfortable enough to freely talk to people who are open minded , aren t afraid to express their opinions , and are open to new possibilities . i also enjoy talking to people who offer new perspectives on situations , sides that i ve never thought about before . it also helps when people are understanding , good listeners , and compassionate about others . it makes me feel good when i m telling someone about my feelings and it seems as if they actually care .","308804":"i would rather be a psychologist i actually debated on going into that field when i was in college because psychology has always fascinated me , and i ve always been able to relate to people with mental health problems given my own history with mental illness .","308805":"my name isnt eric and princess tal , because who said a valentine can only be limited to one person ?","308806":"no it was snowing earlier this morning , but then it turned to ice , and eventually , rain . it s currently raining .","308807":"sometimes they re necessary , yeah especially during the winter if the dog has a thin coat . otherwise , i think they re cute . i know plenty of dogs who love wearing clothes .","308808":"okay ? ? neither do i .","308809":"i follow people at the moment i really only interact with those who are active by liking their answers if they come up on my feed , so i would say it s the same or so people .","308810":"emotionally charged music that you can really hear the emotions of the singer band . one of those songs , for example , is drug dealer by macklemore . it s such a deep and powerful song .","308811":"complex mental illnesses , such as personality disorders , dissociative disorders , and schizophrenia or disorders on the spectrum . so many people talk about depression anxiety , which is a great start , but i rarely ever see people discussing the aforementioned disorders , which leads a lot of people with those disorders to feel left out and invalidated . in addition , there are a lot of people who claim that they support those who are mentally ill , but when negative symptoms arise , they re nowhere to be found . people need to be aware of the negative symptoms of lesser known disorders so that we can better understand treat them .","308812":"i used to be spiritual when i was younger , but i don t feel that way anymore . i wanted to get into eastern religions , but as i ve gotten older , i ve become less and less spiritual and now it isn t something i think about anymore .","308813":"i m done answering these questions . i m not going to spend the rest of my night saying what ages are good to date or bad to date . adults shouldn t date children , that s the bottom line .","308814":"no , not generally . people of those ages are at the same stage in life and can easily understand one another , and relationships between people who are and are actually fairly common .","308815":"yeah , i would . i personally think that there will always be a reason why someone can t date another person their age , which leads them to look for people who are much younger and more easily manipulated . the age of consent doesn t really make a difference in that respect . it s still creepy and a red flag .","308816":"society has expectations placed on people which makes it seem abnormal for others to , for example , get married late or decide not to have children or remain single or go down career paths that are less than conventional . people are so concerned with the lives of others that they often don t do any introspection into their own lives , not realizing that one person is no better than another and we simply cannot pass judgment .","308817":"that s terrible the worst part is that we often don t realize the signs until it s much too late . i m glad you re not in the situation anymore , though , and that you re currently with someone who values you and takes care of you .","308818":"i relate to this so much . i only dated one man when i was a teenager , but it turned out to be an extremely unhealthy relationship and he ended up cheating on me , which i didn t find out until years later . he also pushed me to do sxxual things with him even though i clearly wasn t ready considering i was a child . the entire situation just makes me shudder now .","308819":"that s true too that s kinda what i was aiming for when i said naive , but you just worded it a lot better than i did . idk , when i was , i dated someone who was and soon turning years old . i didn t realize it at the time because i was young and naive , but there was a reason why he couldn t find dates with people his own age and chronically went for people who were much younger than him .","308820":"it s usually because they re creeps who can t seem to find a date with people their own age , so they prey on younger women and teenagers who are naive and don t know any better .","308821":"people are sexually attracted to one another because they want to have sex with them , not for procreation , but for pleasure . humans are hedonistic creatures . people are also romantically attracted to one another because of the need for comfort , human touch , companionship , etc . there are also some people who do not experience sexual attraction , only romantic attraction . being gay isn t against the rules of nature like you re suggesting , especially considering humans aren t the only creatures who are gay .","308822":"my first relationship was with a girl i ve known that i was bisexual since i was years old .","308823":"it s a little known fact that only a fraction of women were granted the right to vote , and it excluded working women and women under the age of .","308824":"i usually end up sleeping hours a day , i can t eat , i can t shower or maintain proper hygiene , i start crying for absolutely no reason , and i barely move because it feels like my chest is weighing me down .","308825":"this is probably the third or fourth time i ve gotten this question in the past week . i love both dogs and cats .","308826":"i believe that some people are capable of changing , yes . i think if they get hit with a major life change , like a loved one passing away or seeing a loved one get hurt two examples , then some people can be motivated to change their ways . obviously not everyone is capable of that kind of transformation , but i ve seen it before .","308827":"bleh","308828":"it makes me more confident in myself because admittedly i m quite good at applying makeup , so i can hide all of my flaws rather well and embellish on my attributes . it s never felt weird to me at all , though especially considering the makeup i use is light and it never feels like there s anything on my skin .","308829":"i obviously wouldn t encourage drinking alcohol when the child is under the legal age , but at that point , i would hope that they would have a strong enough relationship with me to tell me if they wanted to try it . if they wanted to try it , i would rather it be under my roof in a controlled environment as opposed to a party where they could easily be drugged or lose control .","308830":"i haven t learned anything today . i ve basically been a blob all morning , and the only things i ve done have been making breakfast , making coffee , and blow my nose times .","308831":"not generally , no . i have the tendency to hold a grudge , i view people differently if they ve wronged me , and i usually can t get that scenario out of my head . it isn t the healthiest way to go about conflicts , but i can t help it most of the time . i ve always had a difficult time forgiving people because you never know if they re going to do the same things over again .","308832":"i usually go to ulta because it s easier to get to in my area and they have everything i need . i honestly haven t been needing new makeup in a while though , so i haven t been to ulta in over a year .","308833":"sometimes , but not usually . right now , my favorite shirt with a saying on it is a grey tee shirt that says i run on wine and coffee .","308834":"i don t really play online games , if you mean games played on the computer . i only use my xbox one . idk if you would consider destiny to be an online game since its basically always multiplayer , but that would be my favorite . everything else i play is single player .","308835":"i just tried monster for the first time last week , actually it was the peach tea one , and it was really good .","308836":"straight black or dark blue suits with vests and sleek ties . i feel as if classic looks like that will never go out of style .","308837":"idk , everyone has their own struggles so it would be wrong to assume that anyone s life would be better or easier than my life . i ve adapted to my own life , so it s all i ve ever known . i can t really fathom being anyone else .","308838":"i m actually really excited akajfhfkslakdjdha","308839":"my ideal significant other is about six inches taller than me with brown black hair , light brown eyes , a full beard , and a well sculpted back and shoulders . they have tattoos all over their body , a no fucks given attitude , and an extremely hard work ethic . my ideal significant other supports me during my bad waves of mental illness , always knows what to say when i m feeling hopeless and lost , and gives me space when i need it . they put up with all of my annoying habits and quirks , even if that means they re sleeping without a blanket because i roll up into a blanket burrito , and makes me feel loveable and genuine . . . . my boyfriend . my ideal significant other is my boyfriend .","308840":"this is the poorest attempt at trolling i ve ever seen . you didn t send this as a shout out question shout out questions indicate below the question that they re shout outs . you sent this to individual people just to gauge their reaction . using autism as an insult is incredibly offensive , but considering you purposely sent this to people with the intentions of raising alarm , you already knew that .","308841":"pretty much all of the insults thrown at me when i was a child teenager have stuck in my head . they were ingrained so deeply into my mind when i was young that it has caused me to believe those things said about me , even to this day as an adult .","308842":"i enjoy sunsets more . they represent settling down and relaxing for the day , since the sunset happens around the time i get out of work , haha .","308843":"oh , i didn t realize you were a different anon sorry ! ! idk if there s much of a physical difference between being in love with someone versus loving someone i would assume that the chemical differences would simply be more pronounced and extreme . obviously you can emotionally feel the difference between loving someone and being in love with someone , but idk about what the physical difference would be .","308844":"i m highly doubtful that you re asking me to post a photo of my air conditioner , but that s the only ac abbreviation i know .","308845":"over time , sure . it usually doesn t happen overnight but it s common for people to fall out of love with someone they once thought they loved .","308846":"obviously i m aware that people have conversations on here however , that doesn t mean that i want to use askfm as a conversation site . i prefer my page to be a q a page .","308847":"my anxiety feels like a horrid knot in the middle of my stomach , and then it slowly rises into my chest where my heart begins pounding erratically , my arms and fingers get tingly and numb , my breathing becomes disjointed , i get tunnel vision , and suddenly i feel as if i m going to vomit or cry hysterically . any sort of situation can be a trigger for my anxiety , whether it s someone s tone of voice when they speak to me , someone saying something i perceive to be threatening , someone not saying anything at all , loud crowded areas , being alone for too long , and sometimes for no reason whatsoever .","308848":"no i m insecure about myself , i have a fear of abandonment , and i m always terrified that my boyfriend is going to get tired of me leave me , so the idea of having a polyamorous relationship doesn t appeal to me .","308849":"when i m having a conversation with someone and they talk over me before i m finished speaking to add something to the conversation . it s blatant disrespect and i don t appreciate it .","308850":"no , i usually like keeping them on my screen until i get a chance to check them . otherwise i ll forget that some notifications exist and it ll take me hours to review them .","308851":"virginity is a social construct and doesn t actually exist on a physical scale . people cannot lose something that has never physically existed , especially as the hymen can tear years prior to a person having sex for the first time . in addition , the concept of losing one s virginity can be complex , especially in regards to victims of sexual assault . not only is it an inappropriate question , but it can be disrespectful to people who have struggled with assault in the past .","308852":"lol . that s fucking great . my best friend forgot she was wearing an offspring shirt once , so she ran errands with a huge dance fucker dance on her shirt and got so many stares .","308853":"ugh , i know i ve been wanting to buy some to sew them on but i haven t gotten around to it yet . i also have other combat boots with spikes on the back , but i don t think that would be appropriate for a family restaurant .","308854":"most of my creative writing has been in the realm of non fiction , as i ve found it cathartic to write about my mental health and all of the struggles that come alongside having mental health problems . in the past , i ve written fictional works , but they ve all been loosely based on things that have occurred in my life .","308855":"i wholeheartedly agree . my anon seems like a good person and they re worth more than being argued with every three days , especially if their significant other is the one causing the arguments most of the time and they can t resolve anything between them . at that point , the relationship can be toxic and no one deserves to be in that situation .","308856":"i don t have a favorite era , but i do enjoy poetry from pablo neruda and charles baudelaire .","308857":"because stereotypically hair is seen as a masculine trait due to testosterone , while a lack of hair is seen as a more feminine trait . in reality , everyone has hair to varying degrees . the purpose is to protect the body . therefore , due to those stereotypes , women are seen as dirty for having hair i . e . underarm hair while men are praised .","308858":"please unfollow me .","308859":"last night s makeup","308860":"i ve honestly never tried the paper ones before , only the clay thick masks . the one i used yesterday was a really thick dead sea salt mask , and it honestly made my skin so luminous and glowing ! ! i m definitely going to try to purchase more in the future .","308861":"naturally , i would get rid of my mental illnesses they cause a lot of trouble for me in my everyday life , and i would be able to cope with ordinary things a lot better if i wasn t so ill all the time , even with the medication i m on . other than that , i would also like to change my impulsive behavior . i have a really terrible habit of acting on impulse instead of thinking things through , which leads to a lot of really silly and harmful decisions .","308862":"not necessarily , no sex obviously doesn t make a relationship work because it s purely on a physical scale , and at times , love alone can only take you so far . there needs to be patience , communication , and an understanding that people are their own individuals instead of solely a fragment of a relationship . while fighting is normal , if you re fighting more than you re content with one another , then it may be an indication of a problem . it doesn t mean you should give up on the relationship by any means , but you two should try to calmly communicate your feelings and try to resolve your issues in a healthy and mature manner .","308863":"i d rather be content . sometimes excitement causes anxiety , for some reason .","308864":"not really , no . modifications cost money and i don t have the kind of money to spend fixing up a house i m not even going to live in for much longer .","308865":"just let them know that you re there for them if they need to talk you can t force people to stop shing if they re addicted or find that s their only coping mechanism , but you can tell them that they can trust you and you re always around to be there for them if they need you .","308866":"ahh i hope it goes well ! !","308867":"i honestly have no clue what you re talking about . either way , my family doesn t have their own phrases or language .","308868":"i never learned how to ride a bicycle .","308869":"it is a time to relax because everyone needs a break , but that doesn t mean you can t also do homework . you can still relax for two days after getting the homework done on a friday night .","308870":"because a lot of children are not disciplined correctly growing up , so they were taught to be spoiled and to do the bare minimum to get by . tbh , i always had homework to last me through the weekend when i was in high school , it was something expected and normal .","308871":"what you gonna do when there s blood in the water ?","308872":"there s literally no reason for schools to be closed the day after the super bowl . even if their team wins , it shouldn t affect a child s education to the point where they would have to close school .","308873":"i used to have a dog when i was younger she was a german shepard hound mix , and she was the sweetest thing . she passed away when i was around years old .","308874":"yeah , i have my phone organized into folders and my work computer is organized into folders and subfolders , organized by year and month . it doesn t put me in a better mood or anything , but it does make things easier to find and it feels less chaotic . it s more of a controlled environment .","308875":"my weekend has been good so far i saw my boyfriend last night , so we smoked and watched tropic thunder . we woke up this morning and had a cup of coffee together , and then he went to work . i ve been chilling most of the day i ran my errands before am so i ve just been watching tv and drinking coffee . i took a nap this afternoon too . i ll be seeing my best friend in two hours , which should be fun because i haven t seen her in over a month .","308876":"i used to watch anime in the past , but i haven t in recent years . i also used to read manga occasionally .","308877":"none . like i ve stated numerous times in the past , i don t like or follow sports .","308878":"i was actually taking a nap when you sent this lol .","308879":"lmao , you seem a bit mad . plenty of people at my job seem to care about the super bowl , but i m not into sports so i never really paid any attention to it .","308880":"for the most part , yeah what s considered talented to one person may not necessarily be seen as such to another . it s the same concept as beauty , as some people see beauty in some things whereas others see ugliness .","308881":"my boyfriend brings me the most joy the things he does for me , his open mind , his ability to listen and give feedback , and his intuition when he knows something is wrong , they re all things i value greatly . i try letting him know that i love and appreciate him as much as i can .","308882":"sometimes , but usually not . i can t be bothered to shave most of the time and there s really no reason for me to do so .","308883":"perhaps i m simply ignorant , but i have no idea what this means . regardless , you re asking about undergarments so even if i did know what you meant , you wouldn t be getting an answer .","308884":"obviously if i m stuck on a deserted island , i m going to need a boat to get off of the island .","308885":". . . it isn t valentine s day yet .","308886":"advantages people show each other that they care about their relationship to an extent candy is discounted after valentine s day disadvantages some people only feel obligated to show their partner that they care on valentine s day instead of on a regular basis candy is hella expensive prior to valentine s day","308887":"a lot of things have happened over the years to cause my paranoia so in a way , my paranoia is justified . obviously i m not comfortable explaining what has happened , but it made me doubt my safety numerous times .","308888":"australia is probably on my top most desired places to visit , tbh . i d love to visit my friends who live there .","308889":"all the time , but they re not exactly things i wish to share .","308890":"yeah i agree and also the whole you re not trans you re just not girly mindset is so close minded because none of these people even know what it feels like to not feel connected to your own body as if it s foreign and having to deal with people misgendering you simply because they don t agree with you being trans . so many people are transphobic and don t even realize it .","308891":"i never said there was anything wrong with not being girly or stereotypical i stared that ever since i was young , i felt that i ve been in the wrong body . considering you re the one questioning a trans person on whether or not they re trans , i don t think i m necessarily the one who needs to grow up . regardless of what you think of me , i m still non binary and nothing is going to change that .","308892":"i was a teenager when i realized i didn t feel like a typical girl , and i viewed my body with disgust because it felt as if it was not my own body . i didn t actually know there was a name to how i felt until the past few years .","308893":"if you re not close enough to liam to ask him this question yourself , then you have no business knowing about his personal life .","308894":"some people can it s called lucid dreaming .","308895":"i don t own a webcam , but i have a laptop . i don t cover the camera .","308896":"no , that s more of a term used in other countries except the united states .","308897":"i thankfully don t have the kind of friends who do that sort of thing , but in the past i ve experienced this scenario and it would be rather frustrating .","308898":"it s mainly people knowing my personal information , such as my real name , my job , where i hang out , who my friends are , what kind of car i drive , etc etc . i m also paranoid about my everyday life , not just on the internet . i ve had people follow and stalk me in the past , and i m certain that people keep tabs on me every now and again .","308899":"lol yes . i had the whole long bangs in front , short spiky hair in the back , multiple colors , teased ends , etc etc .","308900":"as a general rule , i don t watch movies where animals die so that i don t end up sobbing on the floor .","308901":"i got kicked out of my favorite bar once because one of my good friends got too drunk and rowdy , so the bouncer kicked our entire group out there was only three of us , but still . it s not like we can t go back there , though . it happened years ago and now that friend is more careful with his drinking .","308902":"uh yeah , that s what askfm is designed for .","308903":"i don t believe in karma , so i personally don t believe so . there are many people who perform bad deeds who never get punished , and often people who are good at heart and do nothing but selfless things have a lot of hardships .","308904":"one habit that i m proud of is lately getting at least hours of sleep per night my nighttime meds usually make me tired , so it s good for me to get decent sleep . one habit that i want to change is my skin picking habit . i have severe dermatillomania , which causes me to pick the skin on my arms and legs , and it causes me to bleed . my arms are filled with scars due to it .","308905":". . . you asked me this already . i already told you no . i m not in the mood to listen to religious propaganda tonight .","308906":"i ve been a dissociated mess all day today i haven t been able to focus on anything , i feel as if i m watching myself from afar , my actions and movements have been on auto pilot , and nothing feels real to me at all . i just want to sleep for a very long time .","308907":"explain to them that you re going to do what makes you happy because this is your life , not their life you re under no obligation to follow their instructions when it comes to such big life changes as moving abroad or a career path . if they re worried about being disappointed in you , imagine how disappointed they ll be if you enter a career field that you re completely unhappy in .","308908":"hello do you have a question ?","308909":"not particularly , no . i don t have the patience to entertain useless questions tonight .","308910":"well this is slightly disturbing .","308911":"don t feel like taking a new one , so have an old one","308912":"no consent permission is paramount to everything . if someone is uncomfortable with any sort of physical interaction and doesn t explicitly say yes , then don t touch that person .","308913":"there s no such thing as a perfect relationship every relationship has its own problems and flaws .","308914":"if his life was at risk and i was the only person around to help , then his nude stature wouldn t bother me and i would do what i needed to do to help him . in any other scenario , then i would probably walk past without giving him a second glance .","308915":"it s both , in my case i m fascinated by the psychology behind why a person chooses to commit murder , and i do love the gory aspects of certain crimes . at the same time , however , i also find the procedure behind solving a crime to be interesting because it takes a lot of investigative skill and intelligence to piece together a crime scene and locate a suspect .","308916":"i can understand why some people would want those activities to be private , but i personally wouldn t be bothered by such an event . if you re with someone for multiple years , then you two have probably become comfortable enough with one another to change out a pad or tampon in front of them .","308917":"it s terrible and should be taken more seriously . children and young adults frequently attempt svicide due to the effects of cyber bullying , and a lot of offenders aren t tried in court to the extent that they should be .","308918":"that s a common stereotype , but no if someone says they re neuroatypical , it means that they ve been diagnosed with a behavioral mental cognitive disorder . atypical means out of the norm .","308919":"i don t have opinions on people simply because they may be autistic . people with autism exist on a spectrum of functioning , so it s impossible to group everyone with autism and make a judgment call on them on a universal scale .","308920":"not usually i wear deoderant and body spray every day because i m terrified of smelling like bo .","308921":"lmao , i never post full body photos of myself for a damn reason , boy . move along .","308922":"i didn t know i needed a reason , lol . it has simply never appealed to me .","308923":"this isn t for me to decide , and i couldn t care less about what other people do or don t do in their lives . you re asking the wrong person because i literally give no shits about drama .","308924":"i ve never had to take care of a high maintenance pet before the only pets i ve taken care of have been fish , a dog , and occasionally i ll feed my boyfriend s bearded dragon .","308925":"criminal minds , ncis , the x files , bones , supernatural , parks and rec , how i met your mother , castle , game of thrones , wentworth , orange is the new black , and others that i m probably forgetting .","308926":"i honestly think it s really annoying , but it can be helpful if people want to ask follow up questions without having to link the original response first .","308927":"i support the concept of euthanasia as long as the patient is terminally ill and wishes to die on their own terms without pain or suffering anymore .","308928":"besides the whole psychiatrist fiasco on sunday , i ve recently been disappointed in myself for falling back into bad habits again . i need to have more self control .","308929":"i value my boyfriend and my best friend . they re the best support system i have , and i can always rely on them to tell me the truth instead of what i want to hear . i value their honesty and hard work ethic and their ability to be a good friend .","308930":"i have two typewriters , but unfortunately i haven t been able to use them . one of them needs a new ribbon , and the other one s keys get stuck when you press them . unfortunately , it s extremely difficult to find parts for typewriters these days .","308931":"i m fairly content right now , though a bit irritable because traffic made me late for work because people don t know how to drive in the snow .","308932":"of course i honestly don t know anyone who hasn t .","308933":"not many perhaps five or six over the past or so years i ve had a cell phone .","308934":"y i k e s i m done entertaining this . next one gets you blocked .","308935":". . . both are equally inappropriate .","308936":". . . this is not an appropriate question to ask someone . lmao , what the hell .","308937":"no , i m not . i m mainly italian , russian , german , irish , and austrian .","308938":"i have two tattoos in mind that i want to get within the next year a black and white realistic writing quill on the front of my right forearm a traditional style dagger on the back of my right forearm","308939":"if you don t care about science and history , that seems more of a you problem instead of a me problem . multiple genders have existed for centuries .","308940":"i have no clue . perhaps because it makes them look cute or impressionable .","308941":"lol no , i m just addicted to coffee .","308942":"i m pro choice . i think people should have the right to choose whether or not they want an abortion .","308943":"dark hair , beard , high cheekbones , defined jawline , dimples , brown eyes , tattoos , etc etc . aka , my boyfriend . i like my boyfriend s looks .","308944":". . . that s a brand of watches , not a car .","308945":"i don t fucking understand that mentality at all it s a diagnosis , not a death sentence , and you can t ignore how you react to things or your behavior simply because it s not a nice thing to have . mental illness is ugly and horrible and difficult , it isn t supposed to be nice , and you can t be properly treated if you don t obtain the right diagnosis . it makes absolutely no sense .","308946":"i don t understand how you can be a psychiatrist , whose job is to diagnose people , and actually tell a patient that you don t like labels . that legit blows my mind . she doesn t even know my trauma . she s never asked me where my symptoms came from . she doesn t even know about my bpd symptoms even though i ve explained to her how i fit the criteria and she even has me on mood stabilizers because of my erratic mood swings , among other things . i m so fucking angry right now .","308947":"i think i need a new psychiatrist because i just had a conversation with her that really fucking pissed me off . essentially , my previous psychiatrist diagnosed me with bpd . my new psychiatrist basically took it off of my charts without telling me because she doesn t like labels and doesn t think i meet the criteria , even though we ve never talked about my trauma or how it s affected my behavior aside from regular depression and anxiety . she basically told me , i don t need to know your story because the past doesn t matter and you should move forward with your life because otherwise you ll remain traumatized . you shouldn t even be talking about this in therapy . like . . . how the fuck . trauma is what caused my behavior it s why i am the way i am today . even though the abvse isn t happening anymore , i still have symptoms resulting from it and just because you don t like labels doesn t mean you should take something off my chart that s been discussed in detail before and my precious doctor said i fit the criteria . i m just so fucking pissed off at the lack of professionalism and how she essentially discounts my trauma and experiences . she only focuses on my depression and anxiety and basically insinuates that my other symptoms don t matter . what the fuck .","308948":"he hasn t changed his name or deactivated his ig . so if you had his username before , it s the same as his username now .","308949":"i make a fool out of myself on a regular basis , so i honestly don t know when the last time was . probably the other night when i was drunk at my boyfriend s house because i tend to say some really dumb shit when i m drunk ."}}
