I swore off prescription drugs a long while ago (except like Advil and stuff). It just wasn\u2019t working for me. Wasnt my thing. Now I manage my mental health by talking it through, keeping healthy habits, going outside, staying active, and surrounding myself with positive and supportive people :) Big pharma in the US doesn\u2019t care about helping people or curing diseases or getting people healthy enough to stop needing to take pills.

Sometimes I also call him Sand-o, Sanderson, or Sandra as a joke. He doesn\u2019t really care. He\u2019s pretty used to people asking \u201cis that your real name\u201d?

Merry Christmas and happy new year to you too! :)\n  ","226338":"\n  Haha okay what about it?\n  ","226339":"\n  Welp. Hope you feel better soon sorry bout that\n  ","226340":"\n  Think you just had a stroke. You alright there bud?\n  ","226341":"\n  Lol sorry for the long answer but that\u2019s actually VERY dangerous and should NOT be done for riding.\n  \n  In the event of an emergency the rider wouldn\u2019t be able to bail. For example if the horse were to somehow trip and fall down you\u2019d be crushed to death under their weight with no escape cause you couldn\u2019t get off. If they bolted off and started bucking like a bronco the rider wouldn\u2019t be able to sit up and prevent them from doing that by using their body as a counter balance. If one of the ties holding you to the saddle broke off and you partially fell down while the horse was in motion, you\u2019d be halfway tied to the saddle and dragged by the leg connected to the saddle with your body on the ground next to the horse\u2019s feet risking being trampled, kicked, knocked on the head, breaking your leg, ankle, etc by having it twisted while stuck to the saddle.\n  \n  I\u2019ve actually seen this happen to someone before and they had multiple injuries from it. Broken ankle, torn knee tendon, broken ribs, concussion, and a whole bunch of cuts and bruising everywhere. Overall it\u2019s just a super horrible idea. PLUS a lot of riding involves a form of basically standing up in the stirrups to properly balance and move with the horse. If you were tied to the saddle it would be super hard to do that and you\u2019d be flopping around really uncomfortably.\n  \n  I\u2019ve seen people with disabilities be strapped in the the saddle for hippotherapy sessions with people walking with the horse on both sides of them and with a person leading the horse with a rope in front because the rider is incapable of sitting up on their own, but never really seen someone strap a young child into a saddle actually. It\u2019s important for a beginner level person just learning to ride to hold their own selves up so they can be able to build up their muscles and be better balanced later in their riding journey\n  ","226342":"\n  Hi\n  ","226343":"\n  What is that\n  ","226344":"\n  Yeah learning exactly how and when to fall off is important! Wearing a helmet and learning to tuck and roll properly is very helpful\n  ","226345":"\n  In a relationship \ud83d\ude0c\n  ","226346":"\n  Quite a few lol. I haven\u2019t really been counting but definitely at least once a year so probably like 15 or so times in my whole life\n  ","226347":"\n  Tbh my life hasn\u2019t changed that much with covid other than not going to the movies or out to eat but I didn\u2019t do that very much to start with lol. Now I just order DoorDash and Uber eats instead so there\u2019s basically no change with that :P I\u2019ve always been kinda a shut-in who only goes outside to see the horses lmao\n  ","226348":"\n  Read my bio\n  ","226349":"\n  Who?\n  ","226350":"\n  Nope not me\n  ","226351":"\n  Sandy\n  ","226352":"\n  Yeah\n  ","226353":"\n  It\u2019s more dramatic to watch I guess idk\n  ","226354":"\n  Usually answer more than I ask\n  ","226355":"\n  Not interested in discussing that\n  ","226356":"\n  Never riding a horse again\n  ","226357":"\n  Camping! \ud83c\udfd5\n  ","226358":"\n  Oh how was your dentist visit?
