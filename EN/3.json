Are you okay!?\n  ","3564":"\n  I have a old friend who turns reaped Souls into apples~ So keep that in mind in case you do anything wrong~ ..I won't do anything to you now for the fact you ARE helping my Geno, but if you happen to upset him..let's just say you won't get to experience heaven or heII..~\n  ","3565":"\n  ..I don't know..*Reaper stares at the donuts and coffee he can no longer eat with a saddened expression*... hmph.. how are you doing though Love?\n  ","3566":"\n  *Reaper sighed* I usually don't kidnap people but ..desperate times call for desperate measures..and don't get too comfortable..I still could change my mind and have your Soul turned into a apple~\n  ","3567":"\n  Thanks..*Reaper seemed a little upset that he couldn't actually drink the coffee and stared down at it for a few minutes before setting it on the table beside Genos bedside* sorry about the whole kidnapping but you see Geno, right?

WHERE ARE WE!? *SCREECH*\n  ","3573":"\n  *Oof**It takes Reaper about a hour to regain consciousness on his own leaving the poor Tsun to sit there as he helplessly sees his husband lying on the floor* ...mngh.. Geno..?\n  ","3574":"\n  *Reaper seems to get bombed with Error signs as he tried to calm down and ends up falling on his side on the floor with his eye sockets now closed, he isn't gone through otherwise you'd just see him with open empty eyesockets, he just fainted from trying to remember everything* ..\n  ","3575":"\n  ..*Reaper then drops down on his knees while still holding his skull as more Error signs popped up around him* G-Geno..! Can't--I can't-m-make it stop..!\n  ","3576":"\n  *This could be taken as a curse or a blessing as a anon tried to jog his memory and told him of the events that happened just before he became a Error, he stopped sharing his magic with Geno and stepped away with Error signs starting to pop up around him as he hunched over gripping at his skull*..\n  ","3577":"\n  They aren't from here? Well whoever the heII they are will face heII..*Reaper gives a pretty twisted grin with the one eyesocket holding his eyelight shrinks down to a mere dot and the other eye started twitching*\n  ","3578":"\n  What do you mean it--*Reaper then looks down at his clothes and sure enough he spots the red shirt he had taken from Silvers room is now more brown than red* ..it really did go through me.. huh.. looks like I'll need some more spare clothes..after I make sure your okay first..did you forget you were not only hit by a Gods weapon but were poisoned? You've taken the antidote for the poison but that doesn't change the fact you were still hit by arrows from someone here in ReaperTale who will personally die by Deaths hand when he finds them..you really need to stay in bed and quit worrying about me.. if I'm dead there really isn't much left TO worry about..\n  ","3579":"\n  *Reaper then uses his strings to gently lift Geno right back in bed and uses his strings to connect to Genos Soul so he can share his own magic with him, he's too afraid to rely on his strings to stick a IV in Genos Soul shard*\n  \n  Stay put..okay? I will tie you up again if I have to..!\n  ","3580":"\n  I'm dead! I shouldn't need to worry about that..\n  \n  *Reaper folded his arms though due to his body being dead, his magic is trying to escape it which is why it ignited into flames but with no way for it to actually leave his body since he can't dust, it's forced to continue trying to power him so he functions like he were living, in short whatever magic he uses up won't be coming back, he needs a Reset or something to fix this but he's no longer in his right mind to think rationally at all, being dead he isn't even able to eat or drink the coffee and donuts he ordered Ccino to make him, it literally went through him, standing up you can see the chair he sat in now stained with coffee and donut bits, he can't even gain more magic through food anymore*\n  ","3581":"\n  Y-you can't just--Geno..! Your hurt! Don't make me use these strings again!

Just needed a bit to get myself together, your really hurt Love..you need to focus on yourself way more than me right now..\n  ","3583":"\n  *Reaper shakes his skull as he gets himself up on his 'feet'* We don't need me normal..I'm stronger like this..just..didn't.. expect that to happen..*he looks down at his hand covered in strings* ..I just..need to keep myself together.. Geno will be okay now more than he's ever been.. I'm more able to take care of him like this than I was when I was living.. no Death touch..no more breaking and kiIIing everything I touch.. plus..I don't have as big of a backlash on using my powers like I used to..I successfully destroyed 2 entire timelines and dusted Cross before running out..I was even able to pick up herbs without them crumbling away in my hands.. pretty impressive to me..*you can tell he is not in his right mind anymore*\n  ","3584":"\n  C-calm down..I fine..just..no think... ..thought there.. no backlash ...it wrong.. dizzy..me think.. *Reaper then clenches his eye sockets shut as he tries getting himself together, the strings wrapped around Geno start to vanish* ..me know... is sorry.... don't do magic....\n  ","3585":"\n  *Reaper then shakes his skull and pulls his arm from Genos hand so he can't share anymore magic* G-Geno..your in really bad shape right now..just don't... trying to think.. what...*he's having trouble functioning without having his magic restored but he wouldn't want Geno risking his neck to save his*.. you wouldn't lose... ...

I--w-wait--what's..*Reaper then pauses in the middle of their conversation as his eyelight suddenly disappeared*...\n  ","3589":"\n  You can't kiII something that's already dead so you wouldn't have to worry about me taking damage anymore and since I'm dead, my Death touch is gone and I no longer have backlash from magic use.. I'm strong enough to protect us now\n  ","3590":"\n  ..This needs fixed?\n  ","3591":"\n  Geno!? H-hey..! *Reaper is afraid to actually touch him but he does take one of his strings and gently tugged his Tsuns arm*\n  ","3592":"\n  *Reaper hates seeing Geno cry like this but he's too afraid to hug him currently* Love..I'm still sorta here..I died but the void doesn't let you dust so..*he then explains the whole thing that the mod had said earlier but I think that would only make things worse*\n  ","3593":"\n  I know I should of listened..and I'm sorry..but I'm still here..kinda.. *Reaper then picks up the plush he made of himself with the flame strings\/Error strings and hands it to Geno* Don't cry Love..it's okay..\n  ","3594":"\n  Heh..funny enough..Life caught it right away and asked the same thing..*Reaper then sits down beside Geno with the donuts and coffee he received from Ccino* ..I remember..that...the void..it backfired...big time..it ...i-it ..*his bones started to shake as he continued on trying to explain*..it ..made my own magic attack me...my Death touch..it..it kiIIed me in there..except..you can't dust in there.. so..I..I ended up like this..\n  ","3595":"\n  ..Damn it.. *Reaper then looked away from Geno while holding his arm to his side* ..w-why is it always hard to lie to you..? ..The lie would of been better..\n  ","3596":"\n  *Sh-t--**Reaper did not mean for that to slip and he proceeds to try and lie about it*..It was...just a Death joke..cause ..you know..I'm Death?\n  ","3597":"\n  Love... you really shouldn't worry about the dead..it's not like anything can kiII them now..*Reaper gave Geno a smile* focus on yourself, okay?

That's shocking...I mean I hate the guy too but not sure how he's gonna take that she actually left him..not that it's a bad thing, he did eat monsters for a living..you might be crazy but at least you aren't a cannibal.. *hopefully you don't catch anyone's attention with how you both look*\n  ","4046":"\n  *Reaper is from ancient times his AU is far older where no technology exists at all, they don't even know what gold is, without Geno and the items he picked up from his reaping jobs, he wouldn't know half of the things he does, he thinks cars are giant monsters that eat people, so to him this was pretty confusing, it doesn't look like any of the other timelines he's seen and the monsters are all dressed weird* Why did she come to a place like this?\n  ","4047":"\n  I think so~ *Never ask Reaper for advice, trust me he isn't good at it*\n  ","4048":"\n  *I looked into it there are Victorian AUs including SherlockTale VictorianTale and Underkeep but I haven't seen any Gothic Victorian ones so you have another AU nobody else made yet :v it sounds cool too*\n  \n  *Reaper then follows Socket to the AU* Lead the way kiddo\n  ","4049":"\n  *Admittedly I have never heard of that AU**Reaper looks really surprised* I don't think I've ever been to that one..might need you to come along anyway to take me there even if you said no..\n  ","4050":"\n  ..Okay kiddo,you won't hear anymore arguments from me..just wanted to give you some advice for what your signing up for.. so..where was she last when you...you know..dusted her..? *Reaper gently pats Sockets skull*\n  ","4051":"\n  *Reaper frowned a bit as he glanced back at Geno* Yeah...can't really argue there...how about if we can get those other monster parts under control..thrn you can see her again?\n  ","4052":"\n  I will but just saying that's one person who really loved you no matter what..losing her is gonna be hard on you kiddo\n  ","4053":"\n  If your sure this is the best option then..okay kiddo.. but you might regret that decision later...\n  ","4054":"\n  ..You sure you want that kiddo? Once I erase her memory it can't be undone..and there's no guarantee if you change your mind about this that she'll gain her memory back..\n  ","4055":"\n  Sure I guess, what is it kiddo?\n  ","4056":"\n  I think that was the time reaped Opal.. yeah you went a bit overboard kiddo..especially with the times you attacked Geno, our kiddos and your own family to boot.. *Reaper frowned a bit* I can take you back out reaping if you liked it that much but before we do anything..you still need to tell me where Allura is so we can revive her.. having people that aren't on my list, die, is against rules..\n  ","4057":"\n  Because Kiddo, I've been where you are..\n  \n  I don't know if you know but..I was created by Gaster and Asgore to reap Souls that they weren't capable of reaping..the whole point of my existence was to be this cold heartless kiIIer who wouldn't hesitate to reap someone dead or alive..\n  \n  All the other Gods here don't have the heart to kiII or take a Soul without feeling guilty..except Gaster but he just plain didn't want the job..problem was..I didn't turn out the way they wanted..\n  \n  they made me too powerful where I had little to no control over my powers and nearly destroyed the entire timeline..and I had emotions which was the opposite of what they wanted.. so to fix it..Gaster put me through heII so I wouldn't be able to feel anything anymore..these holes in my hands came from him..\n  \n  After a few years Gaster didn't think he made any progress with me so he made Painless, the supposed to be better God of Death to replace me..my brother.. his powers are more balanced than mine..they didn't go haywire and he could fully control them unlike me..but problem was..he had emotions like I did and was far too kind..he was so sweet and inoccent even Gaster got attached to him, all the Gods adored my brother but despised me..*Reaper looks away* none of them were okay with him going out to dangerous timelines and he couldn't bring himself to take any Souls that didn't want to die..he couldn't bring himself to hurt anyone period..that's the only reason why I'm still here..unlike Paps..I was capable of doing the harder jobs after Gaster broke me in.. I lost the ability to feel anything towards anyone making me the cold kiIIer they wanted.. at least until I met Geno and Life then everything changed..she taught me what it was like to have a friend and how to care about someone other than yourself and Geno..taught me what it was like to love and be loved..\n  \n  Your not all that different from me kiddo...you were made to be this perfect little brother but it all backfired..I wanna help you..\n  ","4058":"\n  I know..don't agree with everything he's done either especially when it came to him almost killing you and the kiddos..that was a huge strike..but.. it also wasn't entirely him in control there..all those dead monsters trapped together..forced back to life to give him life..they're all out for revenge and control his actions.. almost like what Chara did to me..giving me a fake scythe filled with her Hatred so I go out of control.. I wasn't the one in control of my actions..she was.. and everyone thought it was me being crazy...\n  \n  ...besides..not even sure we can wipe him from existence or make him sleep with how glitched he is..\n  ","4059":"\n  Not exactly sure if that's a good or bad thing..\n  ","4060":"\n  *Considering he's the Grim Reaper this was irony at its best look at the number on the left*\n  ","4061":"\n  ...What if I took a crack at it?
