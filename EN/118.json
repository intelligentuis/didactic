symptoms but they re like , memory loss , word salad , catatonia , etc . anyway it s a complicated disease but i m considered residual so like , treated . i don t have hallucinations or delusions any more in any big way . i still suffer from some negative symptoms because they are notoriously hard to treat but i am mostly functioning now .","109249":"this is the most british thing i ve ever listened to","109250":"this is complicated . i loved college , the two years i made it through , and my college loved me and still considers me an alumni despite the fact that i couldn t finish . however , my positive symptoms for schizophrenia manifested when i was so that made school and life less and less doable . i ended up being pulled from school by my mother and she basically locked me away until i sorted myself out and got free , and then i was able to finally get the medical help i needed after a suicide attempt so while school was amazing and i had a lot of friends and the admin liked me a lot , i was literally losing my fucking mind everyday and it became impossible and i became unable to make my own decisions and sort of got majorly , royally screwed over by my mom because no one else knew what to do with me either .","109251":"when i was younger , like middle school aged up until college , people called me pinetree . now i just mostly go by allison . i don t like the

and then sleep like hours and i shouldn t drink while on beta blockers because it can increase my blood pressure but i do anyway just sparingly and infrequently . it s been hard to lose weight while

rapist","109368":"i grew up with an untreated bpd mother who was controlling and abusive when she wasn t straight up neglectful . one of her beliefs is that there s no such thing as bi people , you re either gay or straight . so for years i dealt with that internally feeling like my attractions to all genders didn t really exist or was all in my head . it wasn t until i removed her from my life permanently and started intensive therapy to find myself separate from her abuse that i came out . i ve always been bi , i just didn t admit it until later on . and being in a monogamous relationship doesn t mean that you don t have crushes or don t have weird sex dreams about others ? your personal sexuality is yours no matter what your dating or marriage situation is . i m mostly attracted to women . i have only dated men . it s just a weird thing , yo .","109369":"i have a ukulele i play around with once in a blue moon but i don t really play . i took piano lessons as a kid but my hands

months ago where i entertained his stream of nonsense for those two days and since then , i have barely tolerated him ? like you do know you look like a total asshole right ? no one on this site hates me like you do and over what . over me getting questions on a website designed around answering questions ? nah dude not rubbish at all . you re a misogynist , ableist piece of shit who is purposely harassing me over literally nothing .","109374":"the human torso and i don t know why lol . i always like a good boob portrait tho , mind or someone else s . i like to paint and draw birds as well

dissecting everyone around you . it s really fucking sad . no you re probably not on his list like i am , because for a third time , i am the things he targets . just like you target me as a mentally ill woman because you feel superior . you don t go for the or men i follow who also answer ben s questions . you don t go for literally anyone else , just me . i m a good target . i make you feel like a big person .","109376":"and what i m saying is , because you re too stupid to understand the first time around , is that there s no point in blocking he comes back hours later . literally hours or less later . i report ben when he gets especially out of hand . i report him probably as much or more than anyone here . but when i block him , which i have , he s back immediately . he does this because i am a preferred target . just like i am your preferred target . you re not going for ben , you re coming for me . someone who probably in most things is your ally . it s really gross how abusive your behavior is coming for me over and over again and all of the harassment .","109377":"well that s really great for you . i hadnle my trolls differently . and to be honest , i have blocked ben . like everyone else on this entire site , i started blocking ben when he first reared his racist head . it really honestly if you are me , a mentally ill overweight disabled woman , there is no blocking ben . he keeps me on his regular question rotation because i m a fun target for him . kind of like why you re still on my shit about it . i ve blocked you before too and look where we are now . i get that you re jealous . you re an anon shitbag and no one ever asks you anything . that s why you keep coming for me . maybe if you wisen up , stop being a douche , and come off anon , people won t ignore you . but probably they still will because honestly , you re unpleasant as fuck .","109378":"i said at one point that i hope that anyone here under the age of or so still has time to not be a shit person . that wasn t necessarily just in reference to ben but to all of you young folk who think you re at the top of your game and in a place where you can pass judgement on others . people can change . i was a gasp libertarian when i was like anything s possible . and yeah , like twice a day . as someone who gets garbage from him every day , all day , i am well aware of how often he

makes me throw up . if i m in so much pain that i m throwing up , i go to the hospital , i don t google . the rest of the time i just smoke some weed and hope it goes away .","109384":"i try not to

home that caused the attendants to have to belt up but it passed . being on a plane is a lot like being on a bus . smells the same . seats feel the same . people are the same except maybe a little more entitled acting . the only difference is that you re in the air . meanwhile i learned today that was the first year in history where there wasn t a single causality from plane travel so that s something impressive . air safety is at an all time high .","109419":"i m answering this for , instead of which makes no sense . getting my nose pierced , almost dying of lung clots , getting a new

sorry bleeding is definitely something to sort out with a medical professional though maybe go to a cheap clinic or i dunno asking strangers on the internet about bleeding issues isn t probably going to help you very much","109455":"i mean , i guess they re pretty average","109456":"squawking porgs , rose gold earrings and a bubo on my shoulder","109457":"i m almost so i can , don t know about

don t think so people didn t have cell phones with cameras back then things didn t get taken pictures of as much","109460":"part of being a good allie is to keep changing the little ways we re racist , whether it s microaggressions or whatever so i feel like i ve done well in being a less racist white person this year . i ve spoken up against things that were wrong and strove to be a good person . also i ve become so much better at self care and mindfulness .","109461":"oh noooooo is this a weird fetish thing","109462":"feel even more self conscious about everything i do and also try to get away from people so i didn t smoosh anyone","109463":"every morning for an hour from nov or whenever rainy season starts until june or whenever it ends .","109464":"ignorance mainly . for whatever bizarre reason they think that equality for women means that something gets taken away from them , which isn t the case at all . you don t lose anything by elevating the less privileged .","109465":"bubo had a new toy that was a circle dangling like a chandelier with red , orange , yellow , and green popsicle sticks dangling from it all around about of each color . for whatever reason she loves hates red and always attacks red toys first and then orange and now she s working on greens but that s been the pattern with every other toy similar to this with these colors and blue and purple usually last to the end so i m pretty impressed by her color preferences . to make it more interesting she has been piling her big chunk remains of the toy in color piles , red on the farthest side of the cage away from the others . i almost don t want to clean the lining because she was so serious about sorting those pieces of wood out .","109466":"i started smoking when i was . my mom gave me my first cig lol . there was no good reason to smoke but i did faithfully for years . when i was , i noticed people were complimenting my singing rather than making fun of me so i got really excited about karaoke and did a lot of old jazz songs with my new sultry smokers voice . i quit when i was . it took about weeks for my lungs to cough out all of the gunk , and probably a few more months of mucusy healing but my voice is back to the less pleasant but more normal singing voice so no permanent changes i m sure there are still health risks i m facing because of smoking but if you quit you can get healthy again with time","109467":"mostly indifference . rin grey tabby , yrs old likes to chew on the bright pink tree limbs . the foil is crunchy and feels good on her teeth . the big fake tree gets universally ignored and the smaller table tree that isn t pink hasn t even crossed their radar , they don t hang out on the table . bubo was scared of the trees when i tried to show her so i didn t press it .","109468":"it just seems like a ridiculous thing to bring to a stranger . keep your gross views to yourself ?","109469":"why is it that people who disagree with feminism always have to tell a feminist ? like , your opinions don t mean jack shit to me yet here you are , insisting that this is something normal people discuss .","109470":"a well known fact revolting lol . sounds like opinion to me yo . feminism is for equality of all . therefore everyone should be a feminist .","109471":"an electric skillet and some spatulas , some wonder woman socks ,

way","109474":"this isn t a question . everyone should be feminist .","109475":"naturally i m quick to anger but i also smoke a lot of weed so that dampens that","109476":"today has been nice ! i m not really someone who cares about the actual day of christmas , or gifts or whatever and actually today does give me some anxiety because of all of the phone calling , but today was fine and dinner was nice and i m listening to carols with bubo now . my favorite parts of christmas have been happening for the past month or so now , and that s the decorations and lights and trees parts .","109477":"it depends on how things ended . if it was a mutual drifting away sort of situation then i don t feel bad for anything like that but if they end up being giant assholes over something

things","109485":"well it s not my favorite favorite and i don t have a pic for you but the recipe that seems pretty good to me right now that i can remember off the top of my head is pot roast . take a med sized pork roast , rinse it off , salt and pepper it , rub it with a packet of dry ranch dressing or two depending on size , and dump it in a crock pot with a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of water . add stew veggies , either frozen or fresh fingerling potatoes , carrots , celery , whatever else you want and let that sucker cook on low for hours and it s so good it just falls apart with a fork","109486":"my husband jon","109487":"birdwatching or hiking","109488":"i mean , i hope i improved some and became a better person a little . but a lot is the same .","109489":"oh no , art is a good topic for me for sure i love art . i m glad you re exploring , it s important to experience as much as possible imo . i love art because it starts as a need to create , and if all goes well then it causes others to feel something inside themselves , too . communicating in images and feelings . my favorite historical art movement is probably the expressionist era . between the world wars , europe just sort of exploded with new creative and expressive styles impressionism , german expressionism , surrealism , dada , etc . and it brought art into a whole different direction in the west . i don t know much about non western art sadly because of faults in my teaching but i love the indigenous works that we have here in the pnw .","109490":"schizophrenia has three types of symptoms positive , negative , and cognitive . i don t really have any cognitive symptoms other than some memory loss . positive symptoms are the more psychotic symptoms like delusions and hallucinations and the like . for me i had visual and auditory delusions and got very paranoid about government entities and various omens and superstitions . i don t really deal with that much now on meds , just an occasional voice or like , a quick attachment to a weird idea that passes . negative symptoms are the everyday gross parts of schizophrenia like depression and agoraphobia and lack of motivation and inability to socialize easily . these are harder to treat but i m trying multiple things that seem to work together some . recently i added light therapy which has helped a lot with depression .","109491":"i didn t come out as bi until i was and my marriage isn t open currently . i ve had crushes on women through the years but have never acted on it . if we ever open our relationship i wouldn t mind dating a woman finally .","109492":"emotional service animal . my parakeet was recommended by a doctor for panic disorder and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia . she helps

governor s school for the arts , then went to college at montserrat college of art","109494":"i make a few sales a week , it s not enough to live on but it s enough to keep putting stuff up for sale . mostly i sell bird stickers overseas canadians and australians especially love my birds .","109495":"my husband works full time . i am not able to hold a traditional job but i do sell my art on redbubble pretty regularly .","109496":"yes . not about panic disorder , that s a relatively new diagnosis , like a few years . i was diagnosed with schizophrenia when i was and i met my husband when i was . i ve been on antidepressants for most of the time we ve known each other and on anti psychotics since latuda hit the market the previous ones never worked for me so i didn t take them i just used mindfulness and therapy to get through delusions","109497":"i am married to a man . we ve been married since .","109498":"i do not . i have an esa birb though and three cute cats","109499":"the

wrapped and under the big tree","109503":"no , i don t expect him to but i appreciate when he is . he s his own person and has his own thoughts on things we can t agree on everything .","109504":"they were in the starbucks unicorn frappe so i didn t get to try that one . small amounts are fine , like i can drink a mango flavored lacroix but it tastes spiky as it s making my tongue and mouth prickle . eating a large amount of mango , like a half of the fruit , makes my whole mouth and throat swell up . it s easy enough to avoid but i really like fruit salad so i have to be careful not to buy the tropical versions in case of mango","109505":"still a baby i had some sort of infection and then had a bad reaction to the amoxycillin they gave me","109506":"i think it s most common for maturity to come with age but some people are more mature than others and at younger ages .","109507":"it s business as usual for a bartender , and one day as he is cleaning his bar when an unusual customer walks in . the man is dressed in an expensive suit , has a beautiful supermodel hanging off each arm , and has a limo parked outside . furthermore , the man has an orange for a head . the customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone a drink . he pays for it from a roll of hundreds and manages to get the attention of every woman in the joint , despite having an orange for a head . the bartender is not a man to pry , but he feels compelled to ask about this man s life . excuse me , says the bartender , i can t help but notice that you re obviously fabulously wealthy and irresistable to women , but you have an orange for a head . how did that happen ? so the man told his story . a while back , when i was penniless , i was walking along the beach and saw an old lamp , half buried in the sand . i picked it up and gave it a clean , and poof ! out popped a genie . the genie explained that he had been trapped in that lamp for two hundred years , and that he was so grateful to me for freeing him that he would give me three wishes . for my first wish i asked for an unlimited fortune . the genie said it is done ! and from then on , whenever i needed money , it was there . for my second wish i asked for the attention of all the most beautiful women in the world . the genie said it was done , and since then i have been able to get any woman i wanted . for my third wish and , this is the bit where i kinda fucked up i asked for an orange for a head .","109508":"you don t need it for sure but i use my fingers more than the needles in a weird way of self taught left handed knitting and i end up sort of flicking the yarn loop off the needle with my thumb nail . i also hold back specific loops that need to be included in an increase or decrease with my nail , like when i m counting two out to knit together for instance . the way i knit would be called throwing while most people learn to knit by picking .","109509":"when i was a teen , sure . i just lived through it . one thing that helped me stop having so many pimples though was switching to herbalism by lush as a cleaner , using a light moisturizer that doesn t contain palm oil , drinking a ton of water , and that s it . simplifying my skin care routine cut out so much blemish worrying","109510":"i was a nice kid , now i m a usually nice sometimes defensive adult","109511":"so good . tina and linda are my favs .","109512":"i don t play gta i just vaguely see my husband play from my desk","109513":"one chants between two worlds , fire walk with me","109514":"very short except for one long thumbnail i use as

smoke , first i feel it in my eyes . i have pre glaucoma so i wonder if that s why . it s like my eyes relax . then my neck and shoulders relax . then my problems lift and i don t feel as stressed . i can view things with curiosity and kindness instead of fear and anxiety . i m basically high from am until i go to bed tbh .","109519":"penicillin and mangoes","109520":"some years we buy them something , but this year the cats got a cat tree with scratching poles that was on sale on black friday as their early xmas . bubo is going for grooming tomorrow and i ll probably buy her a new toy while we re there so that will be here close to xmas present . my dad and stepmom sometimes send the cats something so they may do that , who knows","109521":"yeah , i know . but she s gentle and she hasn t attacked me yet . it s her nature to want to preen her flockmates she tries to get the cats too and she preens my husband s beard","109522":"that s a lot ben i d have given up the liquor and kept up smoking","109523":"back to truth and she s being sweet but it s awkward lol . like i don t love having a beak that close to my eyeball .","109524":"bubo is trying to preen my eyelashes here

literally everything i say . just unfollow me it s really boring dealing with you and seeing shit on other people s pages about me . whether or not they were trying to be helpful , they were trying to teach me something without my express interest in being taught . like i said , this is a power move . so i mean , you agree with me , or you obviously don t ? so move on with your life ?","109528":"i m not much of a prankster . i probably did silly things to my sister growing up like hid her toys in weird places and thought that was a cool prank but like , other than that , nah","109529":"probably

my weight down and be more active .","109546":"no , i have extremely normal healthy regular and normal length poos . i think a good portion of that comes from taking a over the counter probiotic

s about worthless i mean , like all of us , i started off just blocking ben but he literally has a new account every day lately so there s really no point at all but it s there as an option and some

p","109715":"i didn t sleep well so i was up early enough to see my husband off to work . i ve since drank a billion cups of coffee , smoked too much weed , cleaned dishes , run the clothes dryer ,

. mris are more advanced use magnets are louder","109718":"no i deserve cookies","109719":"they throw you in a big circular imaging tube , on a cot that moves . you have to stay incredibly still and hold your breath when they tell you to . a voice screams at you through a speaker in the tube . sometimes they want to do a intravenous dye that makes you feel like you pissed your pants when it hits your veins . it s all very loud and uncomfortable but it s mostly a quick procedure and painless .","109720":"i don t enjoy talking about the abusive parts of my past or sexual things so i guess those .","109721":"i ve had both , on several parts of my body","109722":"no , my attendance was terrible . i was always sick as a kid . then in highschool my family moved to another state and left me behind my senior year because i was . so i skipped all the time because i didn t have a family for the school to report it to and my teachers all felt sorry for me . i had already been accepted to my first pick college though so school was sort of pointless at that point .","109723":"i only got detention twice . once was for talking back to a teacher and once was for fighting with some kid who was

established yesterday that you don t agree with my perception of normal anyway so shrug","109726":"to be honest , i am on a lot of meds and i don t feel emotions very strongly lately . so even if i ve been pissed off , it s passed pretty quickly . i am mad that i m out of coffee this morning but i m also aware that that s a stupid reason to be mad . i m mad that one of you keeps using my sarahah to bully me and be ridiculous and childish but at the same time i have better things to worry about . i think it s the beta blockers i take them for panic disorder to keep my adrenaline from overproducing and since then i sort of just don t get that mad for long .","109727":"there was a painting by oskar kokoschka called two nudes lovers in the boston museum of art that touched me so much

memorable","109728":"maybe true . you definitely are bad .","109729":"i didn t say it wasn t i was just saying that you using them as an example makes no sense . american whites are almost as bad at brits","109730":"it s discriminatory but not racist you can t be racist against the race that s doing the oppressing","109731":"native americans didn t oppress any other peoples . they are pushed off into reservations at a fraction of what land they had before . england has done nothing but oppress other cultures . so it is wrong to want to continue to do so . forcing all white areas and segregation so you can have your land for your people oppresses millions .","109732":"yeah i think certain outside forces can make someone change how they interact with people . like , i was quite extroverted in high school but after schizophrenia took over i became much more introverted . i was introverted as a small child as well . i would say i m introverted now and have been since i was but i was definitely outgoing and thrived on company when i was a teen .","109733":"as long as you re aware that you re the worst .","109734":"still racist . you need to accept that you re racist .","109735":"and yet you re still here , sending me garbage","109736":"yes , it s racist . furthermore , i ve slept with a black dude so probably you should avoid me","109737":"i thought you tell everyone you re not racist , just misogynist and xenophobic . like why are you filling my inbox with this racist nonsense .","109738":"this is a weird homework question","109739":"i mean , it felt

friends for sure .","109743":"i don t know any other schizophrenics in real life though i ve met a few online . all of our delusions have been different .","109744":"when i was unmedicated , i had certain auditory delusions and some hallucinations , yes . mostly i just believed big conspiracy type things for me it was omens ? that mixed with ocd made for interesting times because i had so many rituals and superstitions about everything . now i still exhibit some of the negative symptoms of my disease depression , social withdrawal , agoraphobia , etc i haven t had any psychotic features in years . i take a lot of meds and see my doctors as often as recommended .","109745":"not really . i probably would have been classified as such as a teen but i tend to live and let live now , without a lot of overthinking .","109746":"what a shitty thing to ask someone randomly lol . at least word it nicer . you come across as completely ableist . i have always suffered from some form of anxiety . i ve had cptsd since childhood , and i was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age .","109747":"i m fine ?","109748":"if i had it wouldn t make me hate everyone of their gender ? ? like , my mom was super abusive but i don t hate all moms . it s not healthy bruh .","109749":"yes i ve heard some of them they re all pretty bullshit everyone gets hurt and everyone gets disappointed and not everyone acts the way they should act but the rest of us don t hate entire groups of people over what is essentially just life .","109750":"it s not normal to hate the way you do . at all .","109751":"if you don t accept my answer then stop asking me questions ? what does this have to do with anything ?","109752":"but that s not what you asked at all is it","109753":"no , ben , you re not normal .","109754":"i need to have better control over my willingness to participate in financial conversations with my husband . it s something i pay little attention to and i know it bothers him . i just don t react well to numbers and budgets and while i don t spend a lot , that s not the issue , i really just don t ever remember to for instance enter in a total in the online budget sheet , or save a receipt to go over totals later or any of those sort of things . i should be in more control of our finances but i m too uninterested and bad at it .","109755":"my favorite musician entertainers are grimes , beck ,

to do the math on that . of the men she s met she only let one pet her and that was some teen kid who was friends of my friend s kid who helped us move . she lets the woman vet , all of the ladies at the bird store , my stepmom , and me of course pet her though so lots of women .","109802":"my grandfathers were both servicemen and two out of my five nephews served one is still in the army . so i have some degree of respect for what they do because they re my family and i love them . however , i think it becomes almost hero worship in some cases in america with the military . meanwhile so many vets develop mental illnesses while serving and get pushed aside and treated like bums . so i wish if we were going to elevate the status of some military people we ought to have better mental health care for veterans","109803":"you re generalizing again and it s really yucky . the actions of a few doesn t sum up the actions of all . i married a nice guy . i don t treat him bad at all . you should strive to be kind and respectful no matter who you re interacting with .","109804":"oh man . i guess jump because it still gets stuck in my head sometimes .","109805":"i honestly thought about this and i don t know . like they stay put but most things would stay put with me so i guess if you pass the pencil test and can hold a pencil under there , then you can wear a ta ta towel","109806":"if she likes you but she s kinda picky and she prefers ladies","109807":"marshes because good bird watching","109808":"v tru","109809":"yeah it s soft","109810":"i m not posting it here but if you stalk my insta shehitsback i did take a pic wearing it like two or three weeks ago but it s framed pretty modestly so don t get your hopes high","109811":"you can google it it s ta ta towel they are surprisingly really comfortable to lounge around in after a shower","109812":"it s this weird product that came out last summer that s a towel specifically for boob sweat . it s sort of elasticized around the ends so you sling it around your neck and cup each boob in the ends . my friend and i thought they were hilarious but they were like ! ! ! so i waited until there were cheap knock offs and bought one for each of us","109813":"i was gonna say my shark ukulele but then my eyes rested on the ta ta towel i bought as a gift for a friend that s sitting on my sideboard .","109814":"yup . his days off are today and tomorrow so this is kind of our weekend","109815":"eating my lunch at my desk while my husband watches macgyver . gonna go to the movies in a couple of hours , then out to a friends to help with his computer and maybe pick up some weed . i need to go to the bird store too for bubo s seed blend , she s almost out because she s eating a lot lately while she sits with these eggs .","109816":"indeed .","109817":"i think he was rolling his eyes at you and me for laughing about it and making him come look","109818":"an eye rolly one","109819":"lol i made my husband look at this he made a face at me","109820":"usually in the evenings after we eat dinner and watch a tv show together he plays for an hour or so with his buddy josh . today is his day off though so he s playing solo this morning early afternoon . i used to make games but after a really bad dissolving of a partnership it sort of soured me on the whole industry a little bit . not to mention that was going on when gamergate was happening so i just sort of lost interest in games . i still play something sometimes , i was a fan of pokemon go when it came out and i played firewatch and kentucky route zero last year but like i tried to pick up skyrim again not long ago and i was just so bored with it . i ve already played so much of so many games .","109821":"i don t know why i am i apologize way too much for shit that doesn t need it . part of growing up in an emotionally abusive household . i dunno he did a lot of drugs when he was young and it kinda messed him up permanently he doesn t talk to anyone just his cats and the tv","109822":"well i m sorry your uncle was mean to you after you gave him a gift . i don t even really talk to my uncle , he s kinda weird .","109823":"i have never heard the expression mugging it but using context clues it seems it means being a turd . i mean , yeah , it s rude to be a jerk when someone just gave you a gift but were you acting poorly to deserve being treated badly ?","109824":"it s not easy to change anyone for anything . i mean you can try , and hope for the best . my grandma is terribly racist and we all correct her all the time but she thinks it s funny at this point because she s so old she thinks it s hilarious to hate on people . i do know people who started off terrible and grew up to change their minds and be decent but they were younger . older relatives are probably going to be terrible forever .","109825":"i get so much sleep . i sleep on average hours a night . my meds that i take in the evening make me sleepy . the good thing is i m not tired during the day and never want a nap anymore like i used to .","109826":"the vet used a small pen light to look in her eyes which was too bright and made her react , and same with ears which meant lifting up some feathers on her head which wasn t comfortable or a normal interaction . her beak is just annoying to have messed with because it makes her want to bite . a strange lady poking at you is a good reason to wiggle around and fuss a little . the most sensitive area of her body is her abdomen and cloaca but she did better with those exams because she was held more securely .","109827":"i never watch them so i don t really know . i m not a fan of romance novels though .","109828":"i m not really a fan of italian food . i don t like wearing jeans . some tisanes are ok but i m not really a fan of black or green tea but i love coffee","109829":"action movies especially the mad max series and star wars and fast and the furious . roller skating , though i haven t felt strong enough to try it in a while . riding in cars . i hate driving but i love being a passenger and looking out the window at all the trees and buildings and whatever else .","109830":"panic disorder and anxiety in general i can speak on , ocd especially when it comes to skin picking , i have some experience with borderline personalities because of my former partner current friend and also my mother . depression .","109831":"that it goes into remission . that most people aren t showing psychotic features all or even most of the time , and if they re managed well with medications , hardly at all . negative symptoms like depression and apathy and lack of motivation are where the diagnosis can be most disabling . i use a lightbox and take medications for depression vit d , prozac , folic acid in addition to my anti psychotic meds and supplements . but , it is manageable and we are just people like everyone else . not scary .","109832":"she s doing great , her vet visit was fine she s a perfect little birb . i thought she was eggnant but she was just a little chubby from sitting and eating so much . she still might have another egg , we re not in the clear on that for another week . all of the vet assistants and people with their pets in the waiting room came to see her and told her she was a pretty girl . she loved the attention except for the part where she had to be held still and have her eyes , ears , and beak checked that was no fun .","109833":"i always like questions about how bubo is doing . i wouldn t mind more questions about mental health . i like questions about silly things and normal things and my likes and dislikes or whatever . i don t care for politically charged , racially charged , misogynist , transphobic content and if i get it it gets reported or deleted depending on severity unless it s a mild enough to respond to and b gives me an opportunity to try to correct a terrible viewpoint . i will not tolerate aggression and hatefulness towards myself or anyone else . call out posts get deleted . etc . i don t know i think i m like everyone else here i like to socialize in this sort of third person way because i am mentally ill and i don t get a lot of socialization apart from social media or at least , not often .","109834":"sometime s i m fucking tempted . but i m a normal , kind , decent human being . i don t cause harm with my actions .","109835":"i have panic disorder i get panicked about all sorts of things including people sometimes . i have to take beta blockers to get my body to stop producing adrenaline constantly .","109836":"the person i like is my husband who i ve been in a relationship with since","109837":"right now it s this steven universe background but it changes up every hour","109838":"i mean certain childish anons will call me all sorts of things but i don t think i m so bad and i don t think i m a hypocrite i am a kind and honest person .","109839":"i ve never had the money to spend on things like that but if someone does and it makes them happy , then who cares","109840":"probably my husband though it could have been my friend kate i don t get a lot of hugs","109841":"that s another weird british thing right","109842":"do you mean like a fillet of fish in general or the mcdonald s sandwich because i like to eat different types of fish but i m not a fan of the sandwich","109843":"i don t know ? why do you call your friends mates ? everyone has weird shit they do","109844":"i haven t seen it but i saw some of the first one and it was pretty cool i went through a phase where i was watching nothing but nature documentaries on netflix when i was coming down from a psychotic break and it helped immensely .","109845":"just english . i ve tried to learn spanish and portuguese over the years but i never follow through","109846":"i enjoy using them but i don t know much about them","109847":"i don t answer questions i don t want to answer . i don t completely disagree with these coward anons you know . you re not a great person . but you aren t outright aggressive to me and you occasionally ask acceptable things so i haven t blocked you . i think anyone who sends me acceptable questions and isn t aggressive can get an answer when and if i feel like it , that s my rules basically . to the people that offends so badly ? stop following me . it s sooooo simple . don t stalk three or four of my social medias to anon abuse me , just walk away i don t want you around either believe me","109848":"not really but we end up there once in awhile anyway","109849":"well according to google that s where the aldi is","109850":"cool .","109851":"i ve never tried it but probably not i m not big on italian food","109852":"i ve never heard of that chain except for in the popeye cartoon ? is it in real life as well ?","109853":"not really . that strikes me as a very british meal","109854":"not really . i don t have enough local friends to gossip about","109855":"i had some leftover pumpkin pie today it was pretty good . i prefer pie to cake , but i barely eat either .","109856":"i hadn t really paid attention i guess . you use the c word liberally which is a pretty bad one here in america .","109857":"a lot . for most occasions . people think i m mad but i m not mad , i m just using poor vocabulary choices .","109858":"hardly ever but i have i like fried okra but my husband hates it so we never cook it .","109859":"once in a great while but i m picky about it . i think my own cooked fried chicken is better than most other people s and while i ll eat fast food fried chicken i don t prefer it . but i hate cooking it because the oil smells up the whole house so generally we ll order it from the local grocery store because they are the closest to homestyle .","109860":"whenever the re release was but then i was bored with it pretty quick cause i already d the game a while back","109861":"skyrim probably . or nuclear throne .","109862":"rainy and cold mostly . i m healthy right now but i feel depressed because of the weather . i ve been using a lightbox which helps some . taking my bird to the vet tomorrow because she s having trouble laying her fifth egg .","109863":"no , no one would most likely as it s restricted","109864":"an improved version of uber . a ride sharing app . you basically say where you are and where you wanna go and a driver comes and gets you and takes you there and you pay everything including the tip through the app so it s pretty convenient . you could potentially not have to talk to the driver at all if you wanted , they already have the directions ready to go when they pick you up . but usually they re chatty .","109865":"in my younger , stupider , less stable years i have but thankfully i never had an accident of any sort . now i never drive , i hate driving , i use lyft if my husband doesn t want to go somewhere .","109866":"no basically everyone does except for cyclists

recognizable brand .","109878":"in the winter , a lot . the rest of the time , rarely . she hates being petted but loves to pet herself against a still hand . she is the shyest of our cats to other humans and the meanest alpha cat of the cats . she would probably eat bubo if i let them near each other but they do visit through the cage . rin s favorite things are leather shoes and jingle balls .

tree lights on , check in with bubo , make a cup of coffee , and start my light therapy . light therapy lasts an hour , and i drink cups of coffee during . bubo wants to visit for about seconds every hour right now while she s nesting still so i listen for her chirps at the door of her cage letting me know she s taking her egg break . after light therapy i take my meds , smoke up , grind weed for the rest of the day , gather up dishes , and start cleaning the kitchen . once that s done i usually do laundry or vacuum or straighten or clean a bathroom . in between all of this i m listening for bubo and checking the computer for notifications . so i take a lot of breaks . that s basically my dad until jon comes home then we make dinner or buy dinner and eat together and watch tv together and sometimes i exercise and sometimes he goes to the gym and i go to bed early usually not long after i take my night time dose of meds .","109924":"i am mostly in remission on all the psychosis parts of
