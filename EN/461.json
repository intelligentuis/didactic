came to do . i don t need added distractions . i don t really have any bottoms that have pockets when i workout . i like being in the moment . taking a break from whatever devices . i don t need to have a bunch of crap photos of me at the gym to prove a point to people . i don t need to always talk about how much weight i lost either . also i own different stphorm products so it s kind of lame

annoying . i m not always on here every hour on the hour . there can be huge gaps in the hours when i m not on here . in april , i won t be on much at all . foodwise i have been pretty good besides the odd chinese food now and again . you don t always know what i eat unless i get asked about food or something on here . i m not on a strict diet or anything . diets don t work for me . lifestyle change and moderation works for me . having more protein than other macros helps . using my stphorm products helps . taking vitamins and shit helps . do i know what you do ? no . so i don t get why you have to be rude about me doing or not doing x , y , and z . i have admitted that this winter has been shit but that still doesn t change the fact that i m still bettering myself in other ways . i
