destroyed , our souls are simply transferred to other mediums such as the earth . i don t believe in the reincarnation of humans into other humans , so i personally believe that the human population

experience racism because i m white . i ve never been discriminated against due to my race either .","287718":"if i m in the midst of a depressive episode , then tbh nothing i can do will make me feel better . the best thing i can do is try to trudge through the day and make myself feel productive until it s time for me to go to sleep . my episodes can last from days to weeks , and i ve come to the understanding that my best might solely be getting out of bed to brush my teeth that day and that s perfectly okay . it s primarily a waiting game for me , although my depression has honestly been a hell of a lot better these days than in previous years . but whenever i do have an episode , the only thing i can do is wait for it to pass .","287719":"for me , writing has always been deeply personal and has made me very vulnerable . it isn t going to move your audience if it doesn t come from a place of sincerity or pain from within yourself . write what you know best whether that s through heartache , family issues , relationship issues , trauma , etc etc . my writing has always been open and honest , and i find that i write my best work when i m at a state of honesty within myself . you have to really sit there and think about how you re feeling , the source of those feelings , and the past history of those feelings and how they came to fruitation . it s really like you re psychoanalyzing yourself , but applying it to the character or whoever you re writing about .","287720":"it would really depend on what they re already interested in reading or learning more about

s impeached because i do believe it is a step in the right direction . however , the senate is run by republicans and i know , for sure , that he will not be removed by office . it s disappointing , to say the least , that he ll walk away unscathed and i believe this may only fuel more divide and hatred between people within the united states .","287726":"it s pm , and i ve had five cups of coffee today . ask me questions because i m wired cannot sleep .","287727":"uh , i have zero children .","287728":"no one really comes to mind , tbh . everyone i ve met , whether they were good or bad , has taught me something in some form and i ve utilized their lessons to apply to my own life in bettering myself to the best of my ability , at least . obviously there are some bad moments that i wish didn t occur , but like a butterfly effect , if you take away a person then who knows how the rest of my life would have played out as a result .","287729":"yeah , i totally understand that , lol

worthy , and it s definitely some teenager thing going around right now . my roommate scrolls through tiktok on his phone occasionally , and half of the videos he comes across are people doing stupid sh t and saying fuckin mint ! smh .","287731":"it makes me cringe when i hear the fuckin mintttttt tiktoks .","287732":"well , the only way you will know for sure is if you bring the topic back up to them and talk about it in depth . there s no use wondering the what ifs unless you open the discussion again .","287733":"i mean , it depends entirely on the person . they could sincerely just be wondering and there s nothing more to it . some people are just like that . if you trust this person , then perhaps they genuinely do mean that they were simply curious and there s nothing deeper behind it .","287734":"hello do you have a question ?","287735":"happy holidays happy new year ! ! i never have had wintertime traditions besides the usual family antics around christmas time . winter is down time for basically everyone since long island is well known for their summer and autumn activities , so i like to spend my winters indoors , being reflective , catching up on my creative hobbies , and spending time with friends .","287736":"helping people and or being there for people who won t reciprocate the same feelings or behavior towards me in return . i ve always been there for others when they needed a shoulder to cry on , but i often realized that those same people never were there for me in my times of need . i wish sometimes that i cared less about helping other people to preserve my own sense of integrity .","287737":"without sounding biased , my boyfriend is one of the smartest people i ve had the pleasure of knowing . he has a college education , yeah , but what he studied in school is nothing compared to the intelligence he has regarding other areas of his life that he has studied independently .","287738":"it could be an indication that they re having second thoughts , but it could also mean that they want to ensure that you re both on the same page in terms of the relationship . it could go either way , and the best way to find out is to simply ask them if there s anything they find wrong with the relationship and or how to improve upon the relationship . communication is key . if you re confused by something your partner has said , the best possible thing to do is ask for clarity .","287739":"i have a few regrets , some dealing with the toxic and horrible things i did to people when i was much younger . i also sometimes regret not acting correctly in the face of someone else s vulnerability , not being sensitive enough to other people s needs , and not being enough for certain people or even being too much for others .","287740":"lately , i ve been obsessed with sushi . however , i also enjoy fried or scrambled eggs , veggie burrito bowls , avocado chicken sandwiches , pad thai , and penne a la vodka .","287741":"i like talking through my anguish , usually through venting or just to receive some sort of feedback that validates my feelings . sometimes i can act irrationally , so it s good to have some sort of response to ensure that i m behaving in the right manner . those are only some of the times , though . other times , i prefer to be left alone .","287742":"yeah , i got bullied primarily in middle school and early high school . i didn t deal with it very well combined with the troubles going on at home , i had very self destructive coping mechanisms .","287743":"my roommate and i exchanged numbers when we initially moved in together two months ago .","287744":"apologizing for things that aren t necessarily my fault .","287745":"pretty much everything read , write , play video games although i do like playing with others on occasion , paint draw , etc etc . i m very much a solitary person .","287746":"a lot of loops and scribbles , to say the least .","287747":"yeah , i play video games pretty often . i was just playing halo reach for the past hour , lol .","287748":"yeah , a significant number of my friends are gay , bisexual , and lesbians .","287749":"i finished all of my laundry , including my sheets and blankets and pillowcases , and now everything smells so fresh clean .","287750":"no , there was no reason for me to mention my mental health during my interview . interviews are to gauge a person s work history , work ethic , and overall experience .","287751":"hello do you have a question ?","287752":"yes , i ve experienced discrimination based on my sex , gender , and mental illness . when given the opportunity to do so , i try to educate the person . but if they re obviously not open to being educated and are steadfast in their problematic views , i just pay them no mind because their opinion is worthless .","287753":"drinking alcohol , vaping , skin picking , and occasionally smoking marijuana .","287754":"yes it comes from a long history of typing on computers stemming from early childhood , lmaoo .","287755":"tuesdays and fridays .","287756":"well , no . he s a serial killer . but i love how his rationale makes the audience second guess themselves , and how he tries to normalize his thoughts . he s much more aware of his irrational and dangerous thinking in the second season , but it doesn t change his behavior .","287757":"nah , i was never a yahoo messenger sort of person . i used aol .","287758":"a gamer is simply a person who enjoys playing video games . there s no deeper meaning behind it . there s more to video games than simply the top rated games as rated by ign , for example . also , not everyone has the privilege of enjoying highly rated games , and there are multiple consoles and platforms on which to play video games where only certain games are available .","287759":"lmaoo . that s still not true anyone can be a gamer , whether they like first person shooters , side scrollers , puzzle games , strategy games , rpgs , mmos , etc etc . it s useless and wrong to gatekeep video games and to say that someone isn t a real gamer if they haven t played certain video games .","287760":"i disagree . a gamer is simply a person who loves playing video games , regardless of which type of game they enjoy . there are numerous different types of games . i agree that the far cry series is great , but if someone doesn t play them , that doesn t mean they re not a gamer .","287761":"i ve known about the far cry series for quite some time , but i ve only ever played far cry .","287762":"lol , it honestly wouldn t surprise me . rip blockbuster .","287763":"the cover looks familiar , so i ve probably seen it in gamestop or blockbuster way back in the day .","287764":"i m doing well . i ve been doing laundry and cleaning all afternoon , and i m about to grab some iced tea from the fridge and continue writing .","287765":"my first day back to work is this upcoming thursday , january nd .","287766":"i haven t read the books yet , obviously . but through watching the netflix show , i find joe to be incredibly intriguing and compelling on a psychological level . i also love the character of love , from the second season . she s the epitome of a moral gray area , of beauty and tragedy , and of passion .","287767":"my handwriting sucks , lmaoo .","287768":"no , i know nothing about the weimar republic . i ve never exactly been a history buff .","287769":"if i do , they re locked away somewhere .","287770":"i unfortunately do not have any plans for new years eve , but on new years day , my family and i are celebrating a second christmas since my father will be home , and we re giving him his gifts that night .","287771":"i just impulse bought the you book series on a whim because i enjoyed the netflix series so much . has anyone read them before ?","287772":"i care to some degree . but he still takes care of her so even if he is unfaithful , he still does what is right for the family .","287773":"i don t believe my father is the type of person to do that . but even if he does , it isn t my business . he still goes to work every day , takes care of my mother , takes care of his parents , and maintains the household .","287774":"their marriage has been unhappy since i was a child , lol .","287775":"no , i don t believe they have s x . mainly because my mother is immobile and bed ridden due to disability .","287776":"yeah , i totally agree . there s nothing wrong with married couples being happy and having s x together if they already have children . it s perfectly healthy and normal for adult parents to do that .","287777":"god forbid parents have a healthy s x life despite having children , lol . there s nothing wrong with children of appropriate age knowing their parents have healthy and consensual s x . if anything , it only leads to a greater understanding of what healthy s x is and more responsible children .","287778":"? ? ? adults of any age can have s x regardless of how many children they have . it doesn t set a bad example unless they re literally having s x in the same room as their children , lol .","287779":"cont . . . underage ppl w bpd personality disorders which is understandable but when i look back , i definitely started exhibiting classic bpd symptoms at age , as well as developed mental illnesses in general that sort of manifested slowly during the onset of puberty . they should be more open imo . for me personally , medication has been super helpful , but that s also because i ve also been diagnosed with depression , anxiety , and panic disorder . i m on four different medications to try to combat each respective disorder , which can be exhausting and the process was grueling , but i m happy i got to this point . i m also involved in dbt therapy , which has helped greatly as well . i ve been in therapy for a little over two years . my symptoms related to depression , at the very least , started when i was around years old . i wasn t aware that it was depression at the time , and i only sought help in my s when my s icidal ideation became increasingly severe . after meeting with my old psychiatrist numerous times , she diagnosed me first with personality disorder nos and then decided on bpd after knowing more of my past history . most , if not all , personality disorders stem from an early age but i believe doctors are hesitant to diagnose until the age of because teenagers naturally have hormonal imbalances to begin with , which can mimic disorders .","287780":"this isn t a question . unless you have a question , you can kindly leave .","287781":"yes , i m a little bit familiar with maladaptive daydreaming . i m obviously not qualified to say whether or not it s an illness in itself , but i do believe it can definitely be a strong symptom of an underlying mental illness that is recognized by the dsm .","287782":"hello do you have a question ?","287783":"this is actually a source of major anxiety for me , as i ve always been unable to distinguish reality from fantasy , i . e . what my memories actually are versus what i ve dreamed or envisioned . i have had memory loss from an early age and have basically lost over years of my life due to trauma or at least i assume , so my memories are always really vague . i m uncertain of what has happened in my past . i know the ab se i went through as a teenager , but everything beyond that is unknown to me . and my perception of events has always been in a gray area , so it s difficult for me to ascertain reality and fiction .","287784":"cont . . . to not be dependant on a person s validation like that . sometimes i wish bpd was like other disorders you could just take a pill to alleviate it . i just want it out of my head for good . the brain is ridiculous sometimes with what it does lol . yeah , it s funny well . . . not really , when i was diagnosed with bpd a few years ago when i was like years old , i began realizing how many fp i had over the course of my teenage years without even realizing what it was . i constantly switched between people back and forth , some lasted for years while others were months or weeks , and then i would turn my back on them completely and forget they existed . i take a mood stabilizer to supplement my anti depressant , among other pills , and it s actually helped somewhat with respect to my severe mood swings , at the very least . i m still very much attached easily , paranoid , and i dissociate occasionally still though .","287785":"no . my snapchat and instagram are both private accounts .","287786":"uh , i m not a genius . i m just a writer .","287787":"hello i m doing well . i m just relaxing on my laptop rn and drinking some coffee . my roommate just left for work , so i m going to try to sit down and write a non fictional essay that i ve been attempting to work on for a number of weeks now .","287788":"i haven t really been betrayed in a significant manner , besides knowing that some friends were talking sh t about me behind my back . i dropped them immediately .","287789":"idk , that s a weird gray area . even though they respect my pronouns , they still don t believe that my gender exists and that s invalidating in itself . i don t really think i could maintain a friendship with them if they weren t understanding of non binary people or even took the time to try to understand .","287790":"cont . . . but when u do give that person ur all and truly care abt them , they screw u over ur left to repeat the cycle . u can t win ugh , i feel this completely . idk if it s possible but i have two favorite people rn , and one of them is a friend who definitely does not like my company as much as i like hers , and it hurts because she responds faster to my roommate than she does to me , and i always feel like she doesn t even really like me . but it isn t something i would ever bring up , because well bpd and i know i m acting a bit ridiculous . i m so attached to her and i get so excited whenever she messages me first , and hanging out with her is so much fun and i m so happy and content when we do chill . but at the same time , i get so resentful whenever she doesn t pay me any attention or turns down my plans and i know that s really toxic of me to do that .","287791":"my inbox is empty i m off from work today ! ! ask me interesting questions","287792":"i used to take my loved ones kindness for granted , not knowing how difficult i used to be to deal with when i was untreated for mental illness . these days , i m more cognizant of their kindness , humanity , and needs and i always try to express my gratitude .","287793":"if the risk does not compromise your health mental or physical or sense of happiness , and you realize the only thing deterring you from taking that risk is fear , then i believe the risk is worth taking . we will not progress if we re not able to step outside of our comfort zones .","287794":"sometimes i have doubts about my own writing , as in whether or not i m actually good enough to eventually be published or if i should even continue writing at all . although i m proud of my writing and the impact it has had on others , i m also pretty critical of my own writing .","287795":"incompetent drivers on the road , i . e . people who don t use blinkers , who cut me off when changing lanes , who ride me with bright ass beaming headlights , and who switch between lanes to get around drivers times or more to get to where they need to be which is so dangerous .","287796":"cont . . . today he asks to call me . i say yes . after maybe hours he hangs up suddenly then calls me back . i was confused . he then proceeds to tell me it s been a while now bc he felt like it was pointless to get attached to each other only for it to lead to nothing possible pain , he wanted to end things . this was completely sudden for me . he kept trying to give me advice on how to improve my life wish me best of luck i just didn t wanna hear it . i felt it was inconsiderate of him to do despite understanding the reasoning behind it . i feel like the communication was poor i felt hurt stupid . to sum it all up , do you think my feelings are valid ? i do have bpd so i do tend to get attached , im also really lonely so i cling on to anyone that makes me happy . thanks so much for reading yes , your feelings are completely valid ! ! and tbh , if i was in your shoes , i would feel the exact same way . it appears to have sprung up out of nowhere with no warning whatsoever , and maybe it s just my paranoia talking , but perhaps he had an ulterior motive in disconnecting from you like if he met someone else ? . i understand the bpd aspect all too well , especially considering i switch between favorite people far too often for my own good . i become obsessive and attached far too easily , and then i end up becoming hurt as a result because obviously they don t reciprocate those same feelings . all in all , your feelings are totally valid and i understand why you re hurting . i also understand his reasoning , but he did go about this the wrong way and he should have been a tad bit more considerate of your feelings .","287797":"i ll never compromise my own happiness or mental health just to make someone else s life easier , especially if they haven t shown any regard for the sacrifices i have made for them .","287798":"it should be used for self protection , i . e . an intruder breaking into your house . but in recent years , people have literally used guns to inflict massive damage onto groups of people , usually in the form of hate crimes .","287799":"implement stricter gun laws and background checks on people who want to purchase guns . i believe it s far too easy for people to obtain a gun in the united states , and while i do believe that people should have the freedom to own a gun for self protection , there are some guns that are totally unnecessary to own and can only lead to them landing in the wrong hands .","287800":"my boyfriend my best friend both inspire me to be better , and to strive to become the best version of myself that i could possibly be . they give me motivation when my motivation and self esteem are lacking , and they encourage me to continue pressing forward even in rough times .","287801":"one of the hardest promises i broke was that years ago , i promised my boyfriend that i would stop self harming . however , i relapsed two years ago and i never told him about it because i didn t want to disappoint him or make him extra worried about me .","287802":"to the anon who sent me the story relationship advice thing last night i promise i ll get to it , but because i m answering questions on my laptop , the ads are preventing me from reading the entire question ugh ! . when i clear out my inbox more , i ll answer it for you .","287803":"my boyfriend he s the only person i ever talk to on the phone anyway , lol .","287804":"neither . i m not interested in any sports , except perhaps ice hockey because it seems to be one of the more aggressive sports . i never played any sports growing up either .","287805":"nothing really fires me up these days unless a person approaches me with insults regarding those i care about . i care more about my friends and partner s reputations and well being over my own , and i couldn t care less about what other people thought of me . however , if you attack those i care about , then there will be hell to pay .","287806":"sure , i don t see the harm in knowledge about someone s past life . i ve heard a theory that birth marks are an indication of how someone has died in their past life . i have a birth mark on my chest above where my heart is , and it would be interesting to know how that happened .","287807":"when i think about reincarnation and past lives , i think about being transferred into another human being , which i think is limiting . i would like to think our souls get transferred somewhere else in the universe , and if it is on earth , we go back into the natural elements .","287808":"aw , thank you for the follow i m doing well . i just woke up perhaps an hour ago i must have slept for about hours , lol . i made coffee , had some breakfast , and now i m catching up on my questions in my inbox and listening to music . i m planning to try writing creatively later today when everyone in the house is at work so that i have quiet time to myself to focus .","287809":"i don t normally wear printed shirts except for flannel button downs and striped shirts with various colors .","287810":"i ve only ever cracked the screen of one of my older phones , but it still worked . i haven t broken them otherwise .","287811":"i have questions in my inbox . which question did you ask me ?","287812":"i love the concept of reincarnation , but i don t necessarily believe in it . as for past lives , it s certainly possible but i don t hold anything against people who believe in past lives . that s their own personal belief and they re entitled to what they believe .","287813":"i don t believe in an afterlife . and i don t believe in god either . i just believe that our souls exist and inhabit our bodies , and when our bodies pass on , our souls are merely transferred to another being not really an afterlife . our souls are energy , and energy cannot be destroyed .","287814":". facebook messenger . i don t own whatsapp . . skype . i ve never heard of viber before . . snapchat . i use it more often than instagram . . facebook . i get more traffic on my facebook posts than i do on twitter .","287815":"no , i don t watch reality television unless you count shows like ghost adventures ? i m not entirely sure about that , though .","287816":"if it s a secret that i have not told anyone else , i sure as hell ain t telling some random stranger on askfm to know and for the entire internet to know as well . in general , however , i don t keep secrets unless my friends tell me their secret in confidence . i m an open book when it comes to my own life .","287817":"my favorite music depends entirely on my mood in that moment . lately i ve been listening to ambient music , like soundtracks to video games and movies and tv shows , but i also really enjoy nu metal , heavy metal , alternative rock , hip hop , and some pop music .","287818":"yes , i believe in ghosts and i ve had a few paranormal experiences . the most poignant experience , in my opinion , was when i saw a white figure shadow dart across the hallway of my ex friend s house while we were playing with a ouija board .","287819":"no , i ve never fired a real gun before . i ve touched real guns and looked at them , but i was too afraid to fire them .","287820":"i don t believe we have a soul we are a soul . it isn t located anywhere in our corporeal bodies because our soul encompasses all that we are , and when we pass on and our bodies perish , our souls live on in a different medium .","287821":"that embarrassing moment when you re having a nice , formal family dinner with your boyfriend s family and you end up ripping ass at the dinner table on accident . smh .","287822":"i have one brother , and we get along fairly well . we don t talk often or anything except for holidays , but as we ve both gotten older , our relationship has become more solid .","287823":"lol , yes . there are two particularly embarrassing moments that come to mind .","287824":"i don t really believe in the concept of a universal ordinary life because everyone s lives are unique to them , and what s ordinary to one person may not be ordinary to another .","287825":"i don t really like new york in general , but i love the house i live in and it s also in close proximity to other places like the grocery store and pharmacy , which is nice .","287826":"on occasion , haha . it s always a weird coincidence , for sure .","287827":"abandonment by my loved ones .","287828":"i occasionally get follow up questions , and i do enjoy them because it means that someone is interested enough in my answer to want to learn more .","287829":"yeah , i ve smoked on countless occasions beginning from the age of .","287830":"quit vaping that would be the most realistic scenario that might improve my life . i smoked cigarettes for years , and when i quit i started vaping instead . however , i also know that vaping isn t the healthiest alternative and it would be beneficial to my health if i quit that too . there s nothing stopping me really besides my own free will . i don t want to quit just yet .","287831":"the concept behind memento mori latin for remember you must die . it s usually an artistic rendering of the inevitability of death , and places emphasis on making the most out of life because we all succumb to death eventually .","287832":"i don t really think i ve done anything amazing in my life , haha . and the things i have done that i m proud of , i ve talked about it to people so it s not as if no one knew about them .","287833":"i would probably be hurt by their words , especially if it s someone who claims they love me whether it s family , friends , or a partner . i would second guess their feelings towards me because if they really did care about me , they wouldn t put me in a position to hurt me .","287834":"morality is having a sense of right versus wrong , so when i think about morals , i think about criminal justice and the psychology behind why people do certain things as well as their rationale behind it . i ve honestly always considered myself to have a skewed sense of morality , tbh .","287835":"no , i haven t . it isn t something i would be interesting in doing , anyway .","287836":"my aunt got me a sketchbook and a charcoal kit for christmas . i ve been meaning to play around with it , but haven t felt

the time to play as it is .","287839":"my laptop . it s definitely a luxury , but i do love having it for both browsing the internet , writing , and doing research to complement my writing .","287840":"relationship advice , help with mental illness , or writing advice .","287841":"i normally just put on ambient background music , like the skyrim soundtrack or the music from halo , harry potter , or game of thrones .","287842":"yes , it has happened on numerous occasions . i apologize as soon as i realize i did something wrong .","287843":"i m fine with criticism , yeah . it s difficult to be upset over criticism when you ve studied what i have studied , haha . i ve taken courses and workshops where people have criticized my writing , which is something i m most passionate about , and eventually you learn to either take the advice and apply it or disregard what anyone has to say .","287844":"i suppose my writing is my most impressive talent . i ve been commended on several occasions for my skills in writing , and it s also something i m very passionate about .","287845":"why certain things have happened to me throughout my life . where i went wrong with some friendships and relationships . what i could have done to saved someone or made life better for other people .","287846":"i don t usually go anywhere . i like relaxing and staying home .","287847":"idk about breaking up with someone , but it s definitely a conversation worth having with them .","287848":"no , it doesn t really bother me at all . i ve rarely had people use my questions as fillers anyway .","287849":"depends on how self confident i m feeling that day .","287850":"my inbox is empty send me your questions ! !","287851":"then they most likely will not verify you .","287852":"i would much rather live for an additional years in good health . i wouldn t want to be in poor health to the point where people would have to take care of me , and i would much rather have a shorter lifespan if that means i can still be independent and feeling good .","287853":"you have to meet askfm s criteria , which i believe is to be active with answering and asking questions and also having a significant number of followers . you can ask for verification by emailing support ask . fm , i believe .","287854":"i m neutral on it . it doesn t offer any benefits or anything , it just shows others that i m a real profile and not a fake account .","287855":"i love the quality of my phone s camera . i have a samsung galaxy s and the camera is superb . i ve had bad phones in the past , particularly my first few flip phones in the early s , haha .","287856":"ideally , you should not compromise either your happiness and your time in relationships . however , i do believe happiness matters most and if you re in a relationship where your happiness is not being given a priority by your partner , then that s a sign that perhaps you two aren t doing well together .","287857":"last night while waiting in line at the pharmacy to pick up my medication . the line was super long , people were talking and arguing , the music in the store was loud , and it was just sensory overload .","287858":"i ve never been to a magic show before , so i honestly don t know . it was never something i was interested in .","287859":"when it comes to writing , i m better at poetry prose than he is . mainly because i ve been writing since i was a child , took multiple courses in creative writing and grammar , and i practice every day at my job . he s also pretty good at writing creatively , but he seldom does it because he isn t so much interested in writing in general .","287860":"i m most proud of this photo that i took a few years ago on a minolta film camera . i wish i still had that camera i prefer film over digital photographs .","287861":"perhaps i m ignorant , but i ve never heard this theory before . if the people still have the free will to commit

time to self reflect , then sure . however , if you re steadfast in your old ways and aren t open to changing yourself to be a better version of yourself , then the books won t help you .","287867":"i m a much better listener than i am a talker . i find it hard to express myself verbally when speaking , and i like listening to other people tell me their stories and concerns because i want to offer insight and help them .","287868":"sorta ? i ve read be here now by ram dass , but it was a very long time ago . it was very enlightening to me at the time , especially considering how spiritual i used to be .","287869":"i don t really think there s a correlation between the two . those who are good at their job or whatever they do for work are that way because of a hard work ethic and ability to focus . it wouldn t necessarily matter if someone is emotionally detached or emotionally invested in their work unless their emotions are deterring them from actually getting the job done .","287870":"no , we don t have wind chimes .","287871":"i believe the egg came first , because chickens are not the only animals that lay eggs . there has been proof that some animals , long ago , laid eggs that hatched to young and i believe that as time passed on and evolution began happening , it transcended to such animals as chickens .","287872":"i would rather bend water . as a water sign scorpio , i ve always felt very comfortable around the water , and i ve also always been very fluid and wavering , particularly in my likes and dislikes . as for the physical component of water , it would be interesting to affect the tides .","287873":"the fact that you re taking this so personally and won t let it go means that you re the one taking it to heart , lmaoo . if you want to know what kissing feels like , go find a partner and kiss them . it isn t that deep .","287874":"i won t apologize for giving into your obvious fetish . like i said , unless you have appropriate questions , then you can leave .","287875":"like i said , i have memory loss . what memories come naturally to most people does not happen with me , and i have both short term and long term memory loss . if you re looking for some sort of satisfaction to your fetish , you can kindly stop inquiring into my past kissing history . you re not going to get what you want here .","287876":"that isn t being in the friend zone . that s just a woman taking advantage of someone else s feelings to suit their own desires . it definitely isn t evil , but it s wrong and manipulative .","287877":"i don t believe that all humans want to same things in life , besides the basics like food and shelter . there are some people who are controlled by greed , and their desires are much different than the desires of others . these people are also mostly people in positions of power , like governmental positions , so the reason why there is so much violence and strife is because they have the means to be so . as for the common man , some people are simply grown into violence and their desires are less pure because they want to hurt people .","287878":"i mean , if you re asking from the time i turned years old , then it s something i don t quite remember either because i had been dating my boyfriend for a year at that point , and it definitely wasn t our first kiss together , lol .","287879":"i have memory loss , so i cannot remember anything prior to the age of or so . the rest of the years pre teen years and teenagehood are vague to me as well .","287880":"i believe we should measure the value of our lives in the experiences we gain along the way , as well as our accomplishments and sometimes even our failures , because failure teaches us to be better and do better . years come and go , but what truly matters is what we ve learned through the unique experiences we come across , as well as our various accomplishments we succeed at along the way .","287881":"i honestly don t remember . my first kiss was when i was like . . . years old , i believe .","287882":"i don t believe in the concept of the friend zone , it s mainly used by entitled men who cannot take the word no for an answer when they re rejected by women . if someone refuses your advances , then you have to accept it for what it is , and if someone wants to remain friends , then they re not friend zoning you , they re simply being honest with their feelings .","287883":"pretty much any movie by quentin tarantino , lol . he s one of my favorite directors and i absolutely love some of his movies , like pulp fiction , kill bill , django unchained , and inglourious bastards .","287884":"yes , absolutely . there are a lot of educational games out there that teach you different facts trivial pursuit and jeopardy , for example . there are also various games with puzzles in them that make you think out of the box .","287885":"i would definitely choose money over fame , especially considering i would never want fame to begin with . i have too much social awkwardness and anxiety to ever be comfortable with being famous .","287886":"to be a version of myself , but more self assured and amplified . i want to take on more opportunities instead of shying away from them . i want to delve further into my creativity and write more often . i want to progress further in my recovery and healing . i want to work on myself for a change , instead of focusing my efforts solely on other people .","287887":"you re not entitled to say how i should act or look , and you re acting incredibly arrogant and obnoxious . any further judgment or expectations from you will swiftly be deleted . i am who i am , and if you don t like that then you can unfollow and or block me .","287888":"i m satisfied somewhat , but not satisfied in other aspects . much like any other year , there have been both ups and downs and what i ve learned is that i have to roll with the punches , as they say , because there is no use in regretting the past especially when there s nothing i can do to change what has happened .","287889":"i do have to admit , i am one of those people . i like seeing my follower count increase because i have a weird obsession with numbers , and it does only help to show me that people are interested in what i have to say especially considering how much i talk about and raise awareness for mental health . i don t care so much about likes , except for when it comes to my writing for example that i ve posted on instagram . i haven t posted anything since early december , sadly , but it did mean a lot to me when people did like my poetry and prose on there .","287890":"thankfully , i ve never been stood up before . at least not on purpose , lol . there have been a few times that my friends didn t show up to where we were going when we were supposed to go out , but it was because they fell asleep and totally lost track of time .","287891":"i never really understood it , especially in a casual context , because it just sounds totally weird and awkward . lmaoo .","287892":"cont . . . understood and validated . i m sure a lot of people that have read your works feel the same way too . i have been following you here for a very long time now , and i have always supported you in everything that you have done . i have also seen you grow a lot as a person and achieve so many things . whether it s being promoted or moving out of your parents house , i have seen all your progress . it makes me very happy to see you being so resilient and strong despite still having bad days . i am sure in the future or near future , you would continue to make progress in terms of work or healing . i appreciate that you are still here in this present moment . for each day you decide to still be here , i am thankful . even though some days will be difficult , i hope you have the strength to keep going . i really really appreciate you and your works . thank you . well . . . thanks for making me almost cry , lol . this is the most heartfelt message i ve ever received , and i m so grateful and humbled to have received such a message and have influenced at least one person in a positive manner with my openness and writing about mental illness . it s something i always hope for when i advocate for awareness , and i m glad i m succeeding in at least a small way . thank you again your words are deeply appreciated , and i m so happy that someone recognizes and relates to everything i ve endured through my journey . this really made my morning , and i m so thankful for this message . you re far too kind , anon .","287893":"i literally just answered a similar question less than five minutes ago , lol . yes , i know how to cook but i can only really cook simple meals .","287894":"i buy phones based on how they work . i would hate to have a nice looking phone , but it doesn t allow you to customize anything or work very well at all i . e . freezing a lot , glitching , not connecting to wifi , etc etc .","287895":"i know how to cook simple meals , but that s pretty much it .","287896":"i only have a few close friends , and i m perfectly fine with that . i like having a small , intimate inner circle of people whom i can trust , and having too many friends may only lead to further hurt and betrayal .","287897":"definitely not , lol . i was kinda known in school because of my art , but i was not popular and only had few friends .","287898":"thank you","287899":"i like the latin language , even though i don t understand it well . poeta is sorta the latin root for poetry , and lunam is the root for the moon . i mashed them together to create poetalunam , which to me represents the poetry and beauty of the moon .","287900":"yeah , definitely . not because i didn t understand it , but because the mission level was way too difficult for me and i couldn t get past it even though i tried a hundred times , lmaoo .","287901":"there are some small businesses whose sole mission is to raise awareness of mental illness through the products they sell . for example , i m a big fan of the business schizophrenic . nyc it s based out of new york city , and they sell various prints and pins and shirts and whatnot with various sayings related to schizophrenia and the stigma associated with it . they recently got big because of their new shirt that says i m mentally ill and i don t k ll based on recent events where the media has been blaming mental illness for tragedies , like shootings and stuff .","287902":"this is actually very true , and i didn t think about it in this respect . valid point , my friend .","287903":"ah , the more you know ! ! thank you","287904":"i wasn t comfortable being blonde , and i much prefer being brunette or having an unnatural color . get over it . life doesn t revolve around you .","287905":"i m currently in love .","287906":"instagram for my poetry mortem . musings medium link https medium . com poetalunam","287907":"nah , i don t have a youtube channel . i only use youtube to watch videos of the channels that i follow .","287908":"wow . . . this is honestly one of the best messages i ve ever received . thank you so much for your kind words , and this is the sort of response i strive towards when it comes to me posting about mental health and my own experiences . for the past few weeks , i ve been trying to write a very vulnerable , open essay about my mental illnesses stemming from childhood , and sorta psychoanalyzing myself with the help from my therapist . it s been pretty difficult and i keep stopping and coming back to it , but i m hoping to finish it soon . i don t know when i ll feel comfortable posting it , but we ll see .","287909":"i regularly post re post information regarding mental health to reduce stigma . i talk about my own experiences with mental illness to show others that they re not alone in their struggles . i write creatively and showcase my work that reflect my thoughts and feelings regarding my mental illnesses and post them to various websites . i support charities and small businesses that also advocate for better understanding of mental health and illness .","287910":"perhaps it was because i was a bit too young to watch the movie , but the grudge scared the crap out of me when i was a teenager pre teen . it haunted me for weeks afterwards . my favorite scary movies are the saw movies , if those are considered to be scary . i think of them more as psychological thrillers , but there are some scary components to them . i also like the hills have eyes , hostel , house of wax , high tension , and the texas chainsaw massacre .","287911":"i don t agree that everything we know is subject to debate . there are things that are concrete facts , such as the sciences , that cannot be debated because they are the absolute truth . those facts are guaranteed knowledge .","287912":"i don t know anything about the birds in my area , but apparently we get hawks and falcons , which is pretty cool .","287913":"normally my own moods ruin a good time , lmaoo . i could be having a great time with friends , but then an invasive thought will come into my mind , or my anxiety or paranoia kicks in , and they completely ruin the experience for me . also , people who are overly negative in conversation are guaranteed to ruin good times . such as people who do nothing but complain or gossip about others .","287914":"i ve always considered films to be classics , i . e . gone with the wind , a walk to remember , west side story , cinema paradiso , etc etc . movies , on the other hand , are just any sort of cinematic experience you see in the theater or at home on dvd .","287915":"fried when on egg sandwiches , and scrambled when eaten alone and obviously with sides of bacon and toast .","287916":"whenever i think about records , i think about vinyls . whenever i think about albums , i think about cds .","287917":"absolutely there are plenty of people who have a capacity to change your life , whether it s for better or for worse .","287918":"i always liked ralph lauren s polo black cologne .","287919":"things needed around the house , perhaps some shampoo and body wash , future gifts for friends families birthdays , video games , art supplies , books , etc etc .","287920":"i would assume that he wouldn t be with me if he wasn t attracted to me .","287921":"traffic while driving down the highway . i understand it s rush hour on a saturday night , but smh . i m so impatient .","287922":"they make me super paranoid because i don t want people knowing where i live . but as you told me the other day , it seems like it s a nation wide thing which makes it seem a lot better . i have them turned off , so i don t receive any shout outs in my inbox .","287923":"who cares , tbh . they re total strangers and even if they are talking sh t about you , it s meaningless to you and your life , and you ll likely never see these people again . even if they re your friends , if you suspect then they re talking about you then you re probably better off finding new friends . also , if they re leaving you out of the conversation then you re not entitled to be in the conversation in the first place . people are allowed to talk to others around you without including you , especially if it has nothing to do with you .","287924":"no ? i m not even attractive , lol .","287925":"this summer sucked in general , lmaoo . i guess going into hr and having the director compliment my work and progress , and then being promoted , was a pretty good memory .","287926":"osteoporosis from straining the neck and back to look either forward at a screen or down at a cell phone screen there s some indication that people are growing bone spurs in their necks due to prolonged activity . severe eye strain and deterioration because of the artificial light coming from screens , as well as looking at a screen in general . for computer users , sitting down for prolonged periods of time is very unhealthy for your body and posture , and people are encouraged to sit and stand intermittently if they have a job where they have to sit for eight hours per day .","287927":"no ? why would that be rude ? they re having their own conversation in their own language , and that has nothing to do with me . i m not entitled to know what they re talking about .","287928":"last night , i went to a local art show beer garden music gig with a few friends to support some local artists . came back home with some beautiful gear .","287929":"i don t see anything special about in particular to me , it s just another upcoming year that s going to be filled with both enjoyment and disappointment much like any other year .","287930":"the next generation is definitely going to face the repercussions of climate change , and our society s lack of acknowledgment and steps taken to delay or even reverse the damage we ve done to this earth .","287931":"i haven t traveled to any other country , so i m not sure which country i would like to live in besides the united states .","287932":"my parents used corporal punishment to discipline me when i was younger , often as a result of things children or teenagers typically do . i always thought i deserved the pain and humiliation , but as i got older , i realized i didn t deserve the ab se i went through .","287933":"i don t make concrete resolutions because i feel like they just set people up for failure . however , i do want to work towards the following without putting much pressure on myself getting back more into my creative side , through writing and drawing and reading . eat healthier and drink more water , since i rarely drink water these days . get back into exercising regularly . move forward with my healing with respect to my past and mental health . progressing forward with recovery . take on more opportunities to go out and experience different things , meet different people who are in the art community , and say yes more often to things that would normally make me uncomfortable .","287934":"i like learning about serial killers , other mass murderers and people who hurt other people in general . taxidermy is incredibly interesting to me and i like receiving gifts of bugs encased in resin or amber .","287935":"i used to like their music when i was younger , but now it seems that jared leto has basically a cult following , which is a little freaky to me . my favorite songs from them at the time were the kill and from yesterday .","287936":"basically everything , lmaoo . i m an angry person deep down , even though i have a calm exterior , and even the smallest things can set me off if i m already in an off mood .","287937":"getting back into exercising regularly . getting back to my creative side , whether it s through writing or drawing . drinking a hell of a lot more water than i currently drink .","287938":"cont . . . emotionally mature enough to really be able to handle a relationship and all of its repercussions , hence why a lot of them , in my experience , almost always go one of the two ways either they hide the relationship , or they truly do feel the need to show it off . they mistake either for love . yes , i agree with this . i had one relationship when i was a teenager which was totally toxic he was years old and i was only years old , so that gives you an idea . social media wasn t prevalent at the time , but we did a lot of public displays of affection at school to show our alleged love for each other . i was smitten with him despite his toxic traits , and also because i was totally naive , but eventually i did realize how bad he was for me and i was the one who broke up with him after about six months .","287939":"i don t follow people upon request . however , i appreciate the follow thank you ! !","287940":"two days ago . i bought t shirts for two of my friends as christmas gifts , since i know i won t be seeing them for a while and i got an amazon gift card for christmas .","287941":"yeah , there was a sweater that i m going to have to return because it was too big and i wasn t really all that keen on the style . other than that , i m happy with everything else i received .","287942":"i received a hug last night from my good friend when i went out to her best friend s art show at a local brewery . we were saying goodbye and she was thanking me profusely for showing up and supporting the local artists .","287943":"i normally get good morning and good night messages from my boyfriend at times , but that s all .","287944":"i ve actually never watched the simpsons , tbh . it isn t something i thought i would be interested in seeing .","287945":"yeah , snow can be dangerous if you don t have the right shoes on since the ground can be slippery , especially if there s ice underneath which often happens where i live . but snow is beautiful to look at in itself , and i personally love being outside while it s snowing because of how quiet everything is .","287946":"i wouldn t cheat on my boyfriend behind his back or anything , but i would definitely talk to him about the opportunity , lmaoo . if he gives his consent , then i would be all for it .","287947":"these days , google lmaoo . obviously if something is severe enough , i ll go to my primary care doctor or urgent care , but normally i just try looking up either homeopathic cures or otc medication to deal with my sickness .","287948":"i ve bbq d burgers and hot dogs before quite poorly , mind you , and i know there s a bit of a science to bbqing the perfect burger . my boyfriend and his dad are masters of the grill , lmaoo .","287949":"i prefer the countryside as opposed to city environments . even though i sometimes enjoy visiting manhattan and surrounding boroughs at times , it s also a bit too much for me in terms of people and noise and things happening .","287950":"haha , no . that would certainly cause some issues in my current relationship .","287951":"uh , i ve never said that i believed in satan . and i m fairly certain that every time that question is asked to me , i say that i don t believe in satan either . if you anons are gonna try to talk sh t about me , at least get your facts right .","287952":"no , i don t . i only have plans on new years day to see my parents and do a gift exchange with my father at that time he was away for christmas eve .","287953":"i m pretty content right now . i went to a friend s friend s art show i hope that makes sense , and i had a really great time connecting with local artists and supporting their work . i actually ran into an old friend of mine who s an artist and a musician , and i met a few new people tonight as well .","287954":"nay . too spicy for my taste .","287955":"i m happy , lmaoo . i personally find christmas to be super stressful and i still need to do gift exchanges with a few people , but overall i m happy it s over .","287956":"yes , i m feeling better and he s still somewhat sick but on the mend as well .","287957":"in my own personal opinion , it s having trust in and communication with your partner . you always need to have open communication in your relationship because otherwise things will not progress or improve . obviously in some cases it s hard to be honest , but it s also for the best because you need a foundation of trust in order for the relationship to be successful . this goes for platonic relationships as well as romantic relationships , by the way .","287958":"no , i don t believe in karma . there are too many people who do terrible things who don t get punished for what they ve done , and there are also so many good people who have had horrible things happen to them without reason or rationale .","287959":"i would help to reduce the stigma associated with mental health and mental illness .","287960":"cont . . . every five seconds ? what do you need to prove ? lmao i feel the same way tbh . like , depending on the couple it can be endearing and you can really tell which relationships are genuine and which are not . maybe it s just me , but i always knew which posts were faker than others . i have a few facebook friends whose relationships genuinely do seem totally happy , and they post often , but there are definitely others that give off the impression that they re happy and i know that they re not based on what i know about them already .","287961":"omg , no that sounds incredibly interesting i ll have to look more into it .","287962":"no problem , friend . your concerns are understood and valid , and i ve been there many times before . and i agree , it s unfortunate that when you grow up with dysfunctional families that it can affect you negatively , including your relationships to other people . my childhood trauma caused me to develop a plethora of mental illnesses which all affect my abilities to relate to and interact with other people .","287963":"send it to me i ll answer it .","287964":"yeah , it s a bath body works candle .","287965":"insecure about themselves , mostly their own self worth or self esteem .","287966":"it says burn time is approximately hours .","287967":"i think it depends on the circumstance . whenever people post online about how perfect their relationship is , i get the feeling that they re actually fairly insecure and need the validation from others to continue moving forward . obviously this isn t the case with everyone , but it s just the feeling that i get when i see particular people s feeds .","287968":"i believe one of the most common misconceptions about love is that others believe that once you find someone you love , things will be easy from thereon out . in fact , it s quite the opposite . loving someone , and being in love with someone , may be easy and come naturally . but there is still hard work you have to put into maintaining the relationship while also keeping your own sense of identity intact . there will no doubt be disagreements , and it s important to have communication and trust in your relationship with who you love . love itself is the easy part the hard part is furthering that love with someone else , being on the same page , and working toward the same goals .","287969":"yes , they are ! ! one is mediterranean fig and the other is bergamot .","287970":"i love how much my fake succulent garden is growing .","287971":"i have a keen sense of knowing whether or not someone is gay without them saying so , for some reason . lmaoo .","287972":"eh , i think it s both kindness and business . on the one hand , you re doing something to better or improve someone else s life . on the other hand , you re also doing it because it makes you feel good as well . i don t think it necessarily matters unless you have a deeper , more sinister reasoning behind it all .","287973":"? ? ?","287974":"yeah , definitely . if anything , sex appeal and the concept of sex sells is more relevant now than ever before .","287975":"i would definitely feel bad and excluded as well , especially considering you re the only one left out and they don t seem like they re being considerate of your feelings when they re making it obvious that everyone else gets coffee instead of you . personally speaking , i m not sure what i would do because i would honestly feel weird about bringing it up in conversation but that s just me . some other people would have no problem bringing attention to it , but it would personally feel awkward to me .","287976":"climate change it affects everyone regardless of where they live , their social status , their sex or gender , etc etc . the earth is slowly disintegrating and we need to take action in order to delay and or possibly reverse the damage we have done to it .","287977":"lol , i can t even envision myself in a few months from now let alone an entire five years from now . i m less focused on future worries and trying to live more in the present moment these days .","287978":"my boyfriend , most likely . he always knows what to do in different circumstances and he ll be able to calm me down .","287979":"i don t use any sort of lights during the day time i just open the blinds to all of the windows , i keep the house temperature low but warm enough for the cats , i recycle bottles and cardboard , and i bring my own reusable bags to the grocery store .","287980":"noo , haha . once it s on the floor , it immediately goes into the garbage .","287981":"i ve only been awake for like two hours , so it s been fine so far . all i ve done is wake up , tidy up my room a little bit , make some coffee , and browse the internet on my laptop .","287982":"again ? ? ? he didn t pressure me , he offered the idea i agreed to it . i guess you re missing the part where i said we both pitched in money to buy the console . if he was using me for my money , he wouldn t have transferred into my bank account , lmaoo .","287983":"? ? ? my roommate is my boyfriend s best friend and i ve known him for years , lmaoo . it was also my boyfriend s idea to buy the xbox , and we both pitched in money to buy it as a collaborative effort .","287984":"i would much rather travel five years into the future five years ago , i wasn t doing very well at all health wise , and i was still working in retail and i felt absolutely miserable .","287985":"working a full time job while also going to college on a full time basis . it wasn t so much that people thought i would fail , but a lot of people were concerned for my well being mental health wise because it was a lot to take on at once for someone like me , and they didn t think it would last very long . however , i did this for quite a few semesters in order to afford my bills , gas , food , school books , etc etc . it was a stable source of income and made me much more comfortable , and i did it out of a need to , not necessarily because i wanted to , which was more of a motivation to keep moving forward .","287986":"first of all i understand completely where you re coming from regarding your efforts at being close to your mother and what you ve gone through in order to be validated by her . i ve experienced that myself , and often through the same methods because my mother is exactly the same way . i also understand being freaked out and feeling like you betrayed your friend , as well , especially with respect to bpd . bpd makes our emotions so much more intense than they rationally should be , and i do have to say that your reaction to telling your mother about your friend is a bit irrational ! ! but that s perfectly okay , because awareness is the most important part . i think it would be appropriate to tell your friend what you told your mother , although honestly i don t think your friend would think it s a big deal at all because it is the truth and you also didn t go into detail regarding it at all . it isn t so much gossip as it is updating your mother on the situation on a very vague , surface level . your friend is most likely going to tell you that it s perfectly fine and you have nothing to worry about . it s also appropriate to tell your therapist , since i m sure they ll reiterate the same things i m telling you now . it s a good source of validation that you did not do the wrong thing , because i genuinely believe your actions are justified and you did absolutely nothing wrong . i hope this helped ! !","287987":"my boyfriend and i are pitching in to buy my roommate a new xbox one for christmas , since he couldn t take his old xbox with him when he moved out of his ex s house a few months ago . he s been wanting to play games so badly , but has only been relying on his xbox and the few games he has on there at this point . i m picking the console up today at gamestop , and i m going to wrap it while my roommate brings his father to their airport this afternoon .","287988":"definitely all of the times i ve said awkward things without meaning to , messing up words and combining them when talking too fast , or trying to explain something but using less than conventional phrasing . lmaoo . for example , i was talking to my coworkers a few weeks ago about how my roommate and i made a lot of spaghetti and meatballs for dinner the previous night . for some reason , i couldn t think of a better say to explain how much we made , so i ended up blurting out , there were so many spaghettis ! lmaoo .","287989":"depending on the class , we either got graded a f marks or through percentage marks that equated to the different letters .","287990":"yes , i m actually a good liar . almost too good of a liar , as i ve managed to get myself out of situations by simply lying about what i m doing or who i m with .","287991":"definitely the skyrim box set of books my brother bought me . i can t wait to start reading about the history and lore behind skyrim .","287992":"well , when you sent this question , i was sleeping . but now , i m going through social media and drinking coffee .","287993":"sitting down at my laptop to browse the internet , having three cups of coffee , listening to ambient music , and lighting a scented candle .","287994":"yeah , but i probably won t answer until tomorrow because i m going to bed now .","287995":"like , i ll text a certain friend multiple times in order to get a response or tell them that i m feeling a certain way to elicit the response i want from them . i ll try to gear conversations towards my own feelings and events instead of focusing on their own feelings to get validation or sympathy . i don t know if they feel manipulated or not because they ve never brought it up before , so idk .","287996":"yeah , i still find myself to be very manipulative towards people i think i trust in order to get their affection even when i wasn t treated for bpd , i acted this way and i still continue to act this way even after being treated . i assume it s just a part of who i am at this point .","287997":"i have knee high socks that i like wearing under pajama pants when it s cold outside .","287998":". writing . . proofreading . . time management . . photography . . psychologically analyzing people .","287999":"uh , probably the ab se i went through . that would be quite lovely .","288000":"i don t use gloves in general .","288001":"idk , probably around mph ? with my old car , it was definitely mph when i was speeding down the highway to take my friend to the hospital , lol .","288002":"i think most baby animals are cute .","288003":"idk if i have any sort of aesthetic , but i do like rustic looking rooms hardwood floors , dark wooden desks and tables , neutral toned furniture , rugs and tapestries , etc etc . my currently bedroom has tapestries hanging on the walls , as well as string lights . i have espresso colored desks and tables and bookshelves , dark brown carpet , and a few posters flyers on the wall .","288004":"lately it s been coming undone by korn . https youtu . be csjxle lp q","288005":"getting a job in my field being promoted to senior editor . finding the right regimen of medication for my mental illnesses . progressing so far in therapy that i only need to see my therapist times per month . moving out of my parents house . finding myself creatively and writing again .","288006":"i want to be a reinvented version of me someone who s myself , but amplified . someone who isn t afraid to take risks of chances , someone who isn t afraid to state what they re feeling , someone who will bypass all of their anxiety and woes to become what they were truly meant to be all along .","288007":"she cut it short first , i believe , before taking the shaver to it . i don t really remember . i ve had my head shaved for like two years now .","288008":"yes , i heard it might be a bad winter .","288009":"i mean , i shaved my head on an impulse . lmaoo . i didn t go in with the intention of shaving my head , but i told my former stylist to just do it , so that s how it happened .","288010":"no , it s actually rather warm out , considering it s december . it s been in the s today fahrenheit .","288011":"aw , thank you","288012":"i answered this question a few hours ago . but in short , i got a box set of books about the history of skyrim , a framed watercolor painting of chester bennington , teas and coffee , lotion , body wash , and candles .","288013":"my day has been emotional , but all right . i ve been worried sick about my boyfriend s dog , but now i m just trying to distract myself by watching season two of you on netflix .","288014":"my friends and family , lmaoo . i love coffee and tea .","288015":"i don t need to do it any more often than that .","288016":"i m bisexual .","288017":"no , i haven t actually . i ve heard really good things about it , though .","288018":"thanks for the follow","288019":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope you did too the two most significant pieces i got for christmas were a box set of skyrim books from my brother , and my mother got me a framed watercolor print of chester bennington singing , which i m hanging up in my room soon . other than that , i got some candles , lotions , coffee syrups , and tea .","288020":"i know how to maintain and clean a fish tank , but not an actual fish .","288021":"your guess is as good as mine , lmaoo .","288022":"i believe i broke my hand or my wrist ? i honestly don t remember . i just remember being in the room with the machine and there was something covering the rest of my body , and my arm was on the platform .","288023":"no , i ve had x rays taken but never a ct scan or an mri .","288024":"no , i don t shower every day to begin with i shower every two days , and i wash my hair once to twice per week .","288025":"can everyone please send good wishes vibes or prayers if you believe in that for my boyfriend s dog he s at the vet right now , and they found a growth in his throat which may or may not be cancerous . they have to put him under and place a camera in his throat to check it out , and if it isn t cancerous they can just discharge him with antibiotics . i m praying that s the case , because i m already an emotional wreck and to lose another dog would be devastating . please send me good wishes and keep him in your thoughts .","288026":"i mean , they always say hair of the dog , which basically means the best cure for a hangover is to have more alcohol , lmaoo . i always eat an egg sandwich , drink a lot of water or gatorade , and take a nap and that usually does the trick .","288027":"i keep my closet door closed all the time , for the sake of my bedroom looking neat and tidy .","288028":"i ve never overheard anyone saying anything , but i ve definitely found out about it after the fact . needless to say , that friend was no longer a friend of mine afterwards .","288029":"don t f k with cats ! ! i definitely recommend it . it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time i was watching it , although i do have to warn you guys that it s very graphic because it deals with animal ab se .","288030":"i would love to learn how to sing and or play music , particularly on the guitar or the piano .","288031":"no , i m not wearing anything yellow . i m wearing gray and white .","288032":"my ideal partner is my current partner . i value honesty , communication , thoughtfulness , and definitely a sense of humor . i wouldn t be able to date someone who doesn t see the amusing side of things or make jokes , i need that aspect of my life in order to really get through things . luckily my partner encompasses all of that . he s very honest and open with his concerns and thoughts , and he puts a lot of thought into the things he does . he s incredibly passionate about what he s interested in and he makes me laugh every day .","288033":"i told someone i was fine when i definitely wasn t .","288034":"hey friends , my inbox is totally empty . ask me some questions","288035":"regardless of whether the relationship is platonic or romantic , i believe you ve met a right person for you when your chemistry is undeniable and you can have conversations for hours without getting tired of each other . you share similar interests and get excited when you talk to each other , there s never a dull moment between you two , and even if you have disagreements you move past them because you understand your relationship is more important than the small dilemma you re facing .","288036":"yes , it s happened to me on numerous occasions . especially around the holidays . everyone during the holiday season posts about their relationships with their families , posting pictures and videos and whatnot , and sometimes it makes me feel bad because i don t have and never will have that same sort of relationship with my own family . i also understand , however , that things may be different behind closed doors , but the thought still remains .","288037":"i m sure there s a real self for other people , but personally speaking , i have zero sense of self of identity in light of my borderline personality disorder . i grew up in survival mode and i never was given the chance to explore and find my sense of identity growing up , so as an adult , it has resulted in me switching between different personality traits on a whim depending upon who i m with .","288038":"all of my other social media profiles are private . if you want to ask me questions , you can do so on askfm .","288039":"i don t give out my snapchat to people unless i ve talked with them for a long time and trust them .","288040":"being rude is honesty with the result of hurting someone , whether intentional or not although mostly intentional . being honest takes other people s feelings into consideration .","288041":"oh yes , definitely . i try to limit contact with those people at all costs . i come across a lot of these types of people on askfm , for example .","288042":"well , if it s a secret then i certainly wouldn t tell the internet for everyone to know .","288043":"a beanie ! ! i love wearing beanies in the winter .","288044":"askfm has taught me that i have the ability to be very patient in the face of ignorance or controversy , and that i m more willing to take the time to teach others their wrongdoings or problematic lines of thinking instead of getting emotional towards them .","288045":"berniesanders","288046":"oh man , i would never be able to narrow it down to just one song . however , my favorite artists of the decade are definitely grandson , two feet , watsky , and starset .","288047":"i disagree . gender is very necessary and is a part of a person s identity . to discard gender means to invalidate and discard the identities of trans people .","288048":"i don t believe i m a hypocritical person , no . i probably was to some degree in the past when i was younger and more naive , though .","288049":"tbh , i don t really remember . but i m listening to this rn https www . youtube . com watch ? v lgzji jri i","288050":"no , sex and gender are two different entities and should remain distinguished from one another .","288051":"relaxing music and a scented candle lit in the distance .","288052":"when women refer to themselves as dog moms , they re just stating that they re the parent of a dog , lol . it doesn t take away from people who have mothered or fathered children .","288053":"my christmas was all right . christmas eve was entertaining , to put it lightly , and i m glad that there were other people around to take the spotlight off of me . but tonight christmas day was difficult . and looking at everyone else having great times with their families and taking photos kinda makes me feel terrible about my relationship with my own family . i ve never had that and i probably never will . i wish i had a family to call my own .","288054":"it s happened before , and i got the account shut down super fast .","288055":"ask me questions","288056":"not to compromise myself for the sake of any friendship or relationship , the fact that someone would place me in a position to be hurt is proof that they don t care about me as much as they say they do .","288057":"the insides of this can of alcohol , which i will soon be discovering . . .","288058":"i would walk to the end of the earth back for my close friends and boyfriend . i don t have many limits at all , mainly due to my questionable morals , and if there was something drastic i had to do to save their life or something similar , then i wouldn t think twice about it .","288059":"i want someone to eat cheese with . literally . it s a real movie starring sarah silverman , and perhaps the worst movie i ve ever seen . lmaoo .","288060":"i can see both sides , tbh . christmas is a time to spend with family and friends , but it s also been so commercialized to the point where people are breaking the bank to spend money on gifts for their loved ones . there s too much emphasis on gift giving these days .","288061":"it would be interesting to see the identities of all of the anons for perhaps hours . ?","288062":"i absolutely love having campfires in the backyard ! ! especially with a few close friends and we re having a few drinks .","288063":"my day has been fine . i spent time with my roommates this morning then i visited my parents for dinner and we watched a portion of a movie . i m currently at my boyfriend s house and we re just chilling with his family .","288064":"a good friend of mine , actually . lol .","288065":"a song my roommate played in the living room , lmaoo .","288066":"lmao , if you knew anything about maintaining a beard you would know that they require special soaps and oils to keep their shape and softness .","288067":"i wouldn t say it s unhygienic , but it s definitely a good thing for people regardless of their gender to urinate after having sex .","288068":"i gave them both kits of beard soap oil , and i got a stocking full of random candies and stuff as well as a nice bottle of wine .","288069":"lobster ravioli in vodka sauce for dinner last night .","288070":"i usually like cinnamon , so probably not .","288071":"hello my day has been fine so far . i woke up around am , opened some gifts with my roommates , had breakfast , and sat around and chatted for a while . i just got dressed and ready , and i ll be leaving to go to my boyfriend s house in about an hour or so .","288072":"to be patronizing means to be condescending . it s an adjective that is used to describe people who give off the impression that they want to be helpful but they re also acting as if they re superior to you .","288073":"no , i don t like the taste of gingerbread .","288074":"i mean , most men are disgusting and perverse , lol . but to generalize an entire gender as a whole like that isn t usually accurate .","288075":"i don t generally discuss my own sex life on askfm .","288076":"obviously i wash my feet ? you have to scrub your body in order to get the dirt off , lol .","288077":"he doesn t honestly like mechanical engineering , lol . he s more interested in the application of engineering , i . e . being the one actually building things , as opposed to simply designing them . he has good experience now in how designs are made and can pinpoint exactly when certain blueprints aren t going to work before they re even implemented .","288078":"he s a manager of a store , but he also is starting up his own business .","288079":"yeah , he has a bachelor s degree in mechanical engineering . i also have a bachelor s degree in professional writing communications .","288080":"no ? what does going to college have to do with anything , lol .","288081":"he did go to college . he has a bachelor s degree .","288082":"i wasn t raised in any particular culture . as for his culture , it feels nice to be a part of something that s family oriented with unique types of celebrations and whatnot .","288083":"my brother got me an amazing box set of skyrim books for christmas ! ! i m so thrilled and can t wait to read them . ?","288084":"no , i don t have a culture , lmaoo .","288085":"i would like to eventually get married , yeah . but it isn t an priority and it doesn t define a relationship either .","288086":"marriage isn t as important to some people as it is to others . we re one of those couples where marriage doesn t really make much of a difference . it isn t unusual for someone not to propose if marriage isn t a priority .","288087":"there are a few boxes on the ground , but overall it isn t terrible .","288088":"i ve taken before after photos of weight loss , but nothing else besides that . my hair stylist has also taken before after photos of my hair for when she s colored and cut it , which also comes out nice .","288089":"i would say yes , but i wouldn t want the wedding to be any time soon considering we don t live together yet .","288090":"merry christmas , celine ! ! i hope you re having an excellent day with your family .","288091":"happy holidays , friend ! ! i hope your day is going well . ?","288092":"happy holidays , livi ! ! you re the sweetest and i hope you have had the most pleasant of days .","288093":"merry christmas to you as well , if you celebrate ! !","288094":"i listen to the radio every morning on the way into work , yeah . there s an alternative rock station that i enjoy listening to .","288095":"i m doing well ! ! i woke up a little while ago made breakfast with my roommates and unwrapped some gifts with them . i m just relaxing in the meantime and then i m seeing my boyfriend and his family later .","288096":"no one in my family likes their photo being taken , lmaoo .","288097":"obviously it s everyone s own personal choice . i only ever did hard drugs once or twice , the rest was simply marijuana which isn t exactly a big deal .","288098":"abandonment by my loved ones .","288099":"nay . i m not a fan of sports .","288100":"years of age .","288101":"i would rather be able to breathe underwater . i ve always been a person naturally intrigued by water and i feel at peace when i m by any sort of body of water .","288102":"my family doesn t take photos together , so here s a selfie instead .","288103":"i ve never been able to ascribe to any sort of aesthetic . my aesthetic changes day by day , and i suppose it s because i have a personality disorder but i ve never been able to pinpoint a particular vibe and relate to it with my entire being for more than a few days at a time .","288104":"garden gnomes are super cute . there s actually a small fairy garden in the backyard that the previous tenant left for us , lol .","288105":"i would like to learn how to sing well . it isn t something i m determined to learn or anything , but it s always in the back of my mind .","288106":"we would probably hire an in home aide or place her in some sort of assisted living home .","288107":"i prefer video games . i like being able to get completely lost in an rpg and explore the wilderness of fantasy areas .","288108":"yes , i ve slept for upwards of hours continuously at times , due to depression as well as other illnesses .","288109":"i don t watch anime .","288110":"i always enjoy candles and other pleasantly scented things , like body washes and lotions and whatnot . they re things i always use .","288111":"i love falafel wraps , with the greek yogurt and other assorted fillings .","288112":"i m not really an antique sort of person . however , i do own an antique typewriter , which i absolutely love .","288113":"i don t generally eat chocolate , but if i do then it s always dark chocolate .","288114":"i m a bit anxious , but overall fine . although christmas eve with my family went well , it always makes me feel on edge because i never know where the conversation is going to turn . but now that i m home safe , i feel much better . i m going to relax with a beer , watch some netflix , and continue going through my inbox .","288115":"merry christmas to you as well ! ! my day went surprisingly well , actually . i only worked until pm and then i spent some time at my parents house since we always spend christmas eve together . we exchanged gifts with my aunt and cousin , and i legit just got home and it s past midnight . whew .","288116":"merry christmas , tom ! ! i just got home from my christmas eve festivities . it s midnight . i m exhausted .","288117":"no , but i ve watched a few of the movies .","288118":"i was a teenager , but go off i guess .","288119":"i m not exactly

don t live with my parents .","288122":"aw , thank you ! ! happy holidays , friend ! !","288123":"my laptop is always home .","288124":"? ? ? yes , because all people who have little money are solely responsible for being placed in that situation , despite the fact that our society contributes little to people who are poor and instead reward those who are already rich . i ve made excellent decisions in my life . unfortunately , life itself is unfair .","288125":"it seems fair to me . if someone needs something extra , they ll go to the store and pick it up with their own money .","288126":"we all basically share the same food , so it wouldn t matter either way . we eat dinner together , use the same lunch meats , etc etc .","288127":"i would think that he was keeping secrets from me , and then i would have a serious talk about trust and communication with him .","288128":"around for the entire household , obviously split among all of us .","288129":"i never said i was poor i live paycheck to paycheck , much like most other people in the working class . no job will hire a person for only one week , lmaoo .","288130":"i do have a savings account for emergencies , lol .","288131":"considering we literally do not have the option to work during this week , it would be expected to be paid during the holiday as people won t have any other source of income . any respectable organization or company normally pays our their employees for time not used , either . it s only fair .","288132":"i ve used up most of my pto anyway for various reasons so unfortunately it didn t affect me like that . i just wish i got paid for holiday break , lol .","288133":"yes , i ve done it plenty of times .","288134":"merry christmas to you too ! !","288135":"possibly . we can only roll over vacation days , the rest we lose if we have leftover time .","288136":"even though it s a publishing company , we make money off of sales so we re open every day except thanksgiving , christmas , and new years which are paid days . this is the first year they gave us this week off , but i still think it s bull .","288137":"i saw your second message . but yeah , it s ridiculous . it isn t enough that i spent money on christmas gifts but now i ll be short even more money come january .","288138":"i actually started watching the netflix docu series don t f k with cats and i find it to be emotionally overwhelming due to the subject matter , but it s intriguing nonetheless . i watched the first part last night i ll be finishing it over the next few days .","288139":"probably steal from local stories and rob banks for money and whatnot .","288140":"i m glad that my job gave us the week off between christmas day new years day , but i think it s dumb how we re forced to use our vacation time and pto to make up for the days , especially considering the office is closed and no one can work . for those who don t have enough time , like myself , we have to take the days unpaid . i m only getting paid for like . of the four days .","288141":"dragons . i ve always been enthralled by the idea of them .","288142":"i ve never listened to soundcloud before , lol . i prefer vinyls . my old college roommate has a record player in our dorm room it was excellent .","288143":"loneliness is definitely worse . i enjoy the silence and prefer quiet days over loud days . however , loneliness in itself can often be deafening .","288144":"a very merry christmas to you too ! !","288145":"aside from normal house chores , i like watching television , going on my laptop , playing video games , and writing .","288146":"merry christmas eve to you as well ! !","288147":"i love that conspiracy theory , and i routinely watch the show ancient aliens , lmaoo . i find the concept to be so intriguing and , at times , believable .","288148":"i ve had ex friends talk sh t about me behind my back and then play nice to my face , as if i wasn t going to find out that they re two faced . i dropped them immediately .","288149":"i don t have any set plans or goals , but i just want to live my life to the best of my ability and take on any opportunity that comes my way . i don t want to be too afraid to say no to things that present themselves , and i want to focus more on my creativity .","288150":"i want an ice cold beer . luckily , i m about to grab one from the fridge .","288151":"i really need to take a shower , but i m exhausted and unmotivated . i just spent the evening wrapping gifts .","288152":"idk , they just send me into panic mode . loud noises in general trigger me .","288153":"trust , communication , and the ability to understand and realize when you re wrong apologize accordingly . not having an arrogant sense of pride to the point where it prevents you from talking to your partner with honesty and vulnerability .","288154":"not usually , no . the fireworks freak me out .","288155":"i have absolutely no idea .","288156":"i m seeing my mother s side of the family on christmas eve my boyfriend and his family on christmas day .","288157":"no , i ve never donated blood before .","288158":"absolutely horrid . lmaoo . i m terrible at wrapping gifts , and it never improves year after year .","288159":"yes , lmaoo . my previous dog knocked the entire foot tree over completely during our first christmas together . she was so scared , i felt so bad .","288160":"yes , i m tired like . . . of the day .","288161":"my best friend sent me the cutest christmas card of her fur babies ! !","288162":"uh , i graduated college six years ago . lmaoo .","288163":"it was askfm s question of the day , lol .","288164":"i don t give out my snapchat name to strangers .","288165":"no . it would be pointless .","288166":"well , that is the purpose of askfm .","288167":"i fail to see why this was sent to me . y all are obsessed with drama and it s pathetic . if you truly cared then you would message someone off anon , privately , to come to a resolution instead of sending mass messages to others talking your own sh t about people .","288168":"i don t even know what she said , lmaoo .","288169":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company . and yes , i have snapchat . it s friends only though . i only have a few trusted people on there .","288170":"no , education at universities is unbearably expensive in the united states . people usually take out student loans and pay them off for years upon years . i graduated in and i ll probably be paying off my loans monthly for the next years .","288171":"hello i m doing well . i just arrived at work and i m relaxing in my car before going inside . i have my supervisor s second christmas gift with me , and i m excited to see her reaction .","288172":"no , i don t really get

early .","288177":"which question ?","288178":"thanks ! ! i don t normally like selfies with my glasses on , but i liked this one for some reason .","288179":"i like the symmetry of mirrored images , particularly selfies . sometimes i ll put the borders on the sides , but i ve always just preferred to double the image .","288180":"i fail to see the reason behind this message . this has nothing to do with me .","288181":"i don t believe i have , no .","288182":"i like reading , but definitely not as much as i used to . i don t really have the attention span to dedicate to reading these days

and i m so intrigued by it ! ! i believe my daemon would be a wolf . i ve always been interested in wolves , their behavior , and just the majestic and fascinating stories behind them . growing up , my favorite books were call of the wild and white fang , and wolves have always been with me throughout my life . it s the reason why i have so many wolf memorabilia and a wolf tattoo .","288200":"getting a tattoo has always been a thrilling experience for me . i enjoy the feeling of being tattooed , sitting in the shop with artists , talking to my own tattoo artist about life in general , and just collaborating with someone on a meaningful piece of art that i ll carry with me forever .","288201":"i m going under and this time i fear there s no one to save me . this all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy . i need somebody to heal , somebody to know , somebody to have , somebody to hold . it s easy to say but it s never the same . i guess i kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain . someone you loved by lewis capaldi .","288202":"you ? by two feet . https youtu . be ftjbyi igw","288203":"freedom is a feeling of being completely unrestrained , liberated , and having the ability to do what you want to do without much push back or reins at all . you are your own individual and have the freedom to make conscious decisions according to your own will , not the will or expectations of anyone else .","288204":"anything with jalape os . i can t take the heat , lol .","288205":"yes , there are some moments in peoples lives where they are desperate for money for various reasons , whether it s to afford food or shelter or bills .","288206":"i would donate to local charities , as well as national charities . i would help out small business owners as well , especially my friends who run etsy shops and whatnot .","288207":"i m actually pretty motivated by money , and i ll go out of my way in certain situations if there s monetary gain involved . i ve made money through nefarious means in the past when i was desperate enough for it .","288208":"i m not sure because i m not exactly a shy person , i m more socially anxious awkward than anything else . once i m comfortable with a person then i m essentially an open book and quite obnoxious , lol .","288209":"emotional pain is more tolerable to me , i guess because in a way i ve been conditioned to endure it after struggling with inner pain for so long . i ve learned to accept and adapt over the years . physical pain , on the other hand , is sometimes unbearable to me . i basically live off of ibuprofen , lmaoo .","288210":"i m a completely different person , tbh . years ago , i was a senior in high school and was still heavily involved in serious mental illness , s icidal ideation , and self harm to addictive levels . i honestly couldn t see myself living past the age of . now , at years old , i m living independently , have an amazing job , and my mental

distant and neither one of us put in the effort to maintain the friendship .","288216":"no . the few memories that i have that are precious to me are sometimes the only things that keep me holding on when times get rough . i don t feel the need to be smarter either .","288217":"last night , i was invited by my roommate to go out with him and one of our mutual friends . i ended up inviting another close friend of mine , and we had a great time together .","288218":"yes , otherwise i honestly would spend christmas with my friends partner instead of with my own family . i actually visited my mother this afternoon to clean the house and decorate with various christmas decorations in preparation for our christmas eve dinner .","288219":"a few years ago , i was terrified when a close loved one overdosed on drugs i couldn t wake them up . i thought they had passed away and i couldn t cope .","288220":"hello the weather today was actually very nice . it was in the mid s fahrenheit and sunny , which made running my errands a lot easier . however , everyone is doing their last minute shopping so the roads were wildly busy .","288221":"my worst nightmare consists of imagery and ideas that are frankly inappropriate for askfm they were entirely morbid and grotesque , and it still haunts me sometimes . it was a reoccurring dream that happened a lot when i was a teenager severely depressed s icidal .","288222":"a rebellious , angsty teenager falls in love with a typical bad boy who actually turns out to be a murderous , mentally unhinged individual . silly pranks turned into methods of k lling and she s devastated with what she s gotten herself into .","288223":"depends on what i m wearing , tbh . some people have approached me with no problem but other times , i m avoided greatly . i m aware that i have resting bitch face lol so that turns a lot of people off .","288224":"ugh , yes . tbh , i m always in a perpetual state of exhaustion and i can basically sleep anywhere and at any time , lol .","288225":"yes , although i wish i had the funds to have bought more things for people . the only aspect of christmas that i enjoy is seeing people open the gifts i bought them .","288226":"i saw my psychiatrist today she complimented me on how well i m adjusting to all of the sudden changes in my life , and she called me a genuinely good person .","288227":"does mac mean mcdonalds ? if so , then mcdonalds . i never liked kfc s food , it disgusts me .","288228":"obama , although i m aware he s done his fair share of things too . but trump is completely unprofessional , and he s not fit to be in the position of power over the government american society as a whole .","288229":"probably , on convention tickets , plane tickets , and hotel reservations .","288230":"this is so sweet thoughtful thank you . i had a rough afternoon and this message made me smile .","288231":"i have a few , actually . for my aunt , i bought her a steel cast wall decor that says love but the o is in the shape of a horseshoe . she loves horses , so i think she ll love it . for my dad , i bought blueprints of various nasa things and placed them in a frame , which looks really nice . for my cousin , i bought her a bunch of fun stuff from the show friends , since she s obsessed with that show . i got her a pint glass with quotes and images on it , a packet of stickers , and a cookbook . for my boyfriend , i bought a d holographic lamp that shows an image of fish in the sea . it changes colors too .","288232":"i just need to pick up one gift card i m all set ! ! i m also waiting on one more package , which should arrive tomorrow .","288233":"what about him ? that wouldn t change my answer , lol .","288234":"new york state .","288235":"i don t really . . . have a power move ? i just focus on my work and try to make the most out of my workday so that i never fall behind .","288236":"i would make my boyfriend happy , without a doubt . he deserves the world .","288237":"it s going well . i just got home from running errands , and i received some of the last of my packages in the mail for christmas . so i m going to continue wrapping gifts tonight prior to cooking dinner . my roommate and i went to applebee s for lunch , and someone randomly came up to us gave us in gift cards and said merry christmas ! it was so kind and unexpected , that sort of thing has never happened to me before .","288238":"and .","288239":"there sometimes is no rhyme or reason to it , but a lot of people are fueled by jealousy or their need for greed . not everyone has good intentions and are motivated by monetary purposes , especially in terms of cashing in life insurance policies .","288240":"yes , i find those shows to be incredibly entertaining interesting . obviously i don t find their suffering to be enjoyable , but i like learning about the psychological reasons behind why people hurt others .","288241":"well , if i m in denial of something then chances are , i m not aware that it s something i m in denial of .","288242":"i think it s fair , lol . i was one of those people who bought the vip program .","288243":"hello do you have a question ?","288244":"well yeah , considering i live with my roommate and not with my boyfriend , lol . it s pretty inevitable when you live with someone and see them all the time .","288245":"success is being happy with the progression you re making toward your goals it isn t defined by milestones by any means , but rather the journey you re taking in order to reach your objectives . if you re happy with where you are , and have the necessities to have shelter , food , and running water , then i would consider that a success .","288246":"i would probably make a mini apartment out of it , lmaoo . running electricity , a bathroom , a small kitchen with a stove oven , and i would purchase a lot of canned goods because they re not perishable for a long time . i would also like some sort of skylight or ability to see the outside world and check up on how things are progressing to see whether or not it was safe to come out of hiding .","288247":"i believe i would rather be a jack of all trades . it s good to have your hands in several pots , so to speak , and to have various knowledge about a variety of things instead of focusing all of your efforts and attention on only one facet of life .","288248":"singing , most definitely . i ve always wanted to take singing lessons because i love to sing , but my voice is absolutely horrid .","288249":"no , i ve always been afraid that i would hurt them on accident .","288250":"giving people gifts and watching them open their presents , seeing their reactions to what i got them .","288251":"unlimited pizza ! ! i love tacos , but pizza is much more satisfying to me .","288252":"depends on what and or who is rejecting me , as well as my current mood in that moment . there have been times when i ve taken it way too personally and got upset over it , while there are other times when it doesn t bother me whatsoever .","288253":"thanks , i appreciate it ! !","288254":"no , you don t . life was so much simpler when all i had to worry about was attending college and doing a part time job , lmaoo .","288255":"it should only take a few hours , but i m sure the grocery store is going to be filled to the brim with people buying groceries for their christmas dinners .","288256":"there are definitely some benefits to attending college , but it isn t for everyone . just study hard , try your best , and think of the positive outcomes . i was just on my facebook memories , and my graduation day from college was six years ago today , haha .","288257":"i m thinking about the various errands i ll have to run later today when my roommate gets home . we re going to go grocery shopping , then we need to hit a few stores for some final christmas shopping before next week .","288258":"if you re asking why colleges and schools in general give final exams at the end of the semester , it s simply a way of quizzing your knowledge of what you ve learned the entire semester in order to give you the final grade . i never really liked big exams like that because i found them to be intimidating , but it s simply the way it is and it s always been the case . i would prefer courses to test you periodically throughout the semester and add up that cumulative grade instead of having , for example , one mid term and one final exam .","288259":"it depends on the bank , but yes most banks are closed on christmas day , and some are even closed on christmas eve .","288260":"when i was on a major health kick , i used to only drink coffee with stevia and vanilla soy milk . but lately , i only have coffee at home on the weekends during the week , i just make coffee at work and don t have any when i get home , so i just use various flavors of creamer . lately i ve been using a peppermint mocha creamer .","288261":"lol , no . i have not seen that footage . that isn t how it works . . . for either portion of this message .","288262":"oh wow , that s terrible . when i was in college , i remember having final exams the week before christmas but never on christmas eve .","288263":"unfortunately , i don t have the collection anymore since i moved houses . i kept half of my mugs at my parents house and only took of my favorite mugs to my new house . however , i got two more mugs for christmas from my coworkers , so the collection is slowly growing , rofll . my favorite mug is my mental health advocate white mug . it holds oz of coffee and is white , and for some reason i love white mugs because it s such a stark contrast to the coffee or tea that s inside .","288264":"i m content with staying home , catching up on my favorite television shows , making pots of coffee , and seeing my friends .","288265":"thank you happy holidays to you as well ! !","288266":"no , i don t believe it s going to get that wild . there has always been tension between the republican and democratic parties , but violence normally comes from individuals , not a group as a whole .","288267":"christmas festivities ! ! my office always celebrates the holidays , especially since so many people are off from work next week .","288268":"a crackling fireplace is one of the only ways for me to relax . it s so tranquil and peaceful .","288269":"serotonin would be pleasant .","288270":"i have a terrible habit of skin picking , also known as dermatillomania . i pick at blemishes on my skin until they bleed and scab and scar over . there are scars littered all over my body . other than that , i do bite my nails and cuticles a lot , too .","288271":"i suppose i m a professional in writing and or proofreading , considering that s what i have a degree in and do for my current job .","288272":"grandson ! ! i love his political activism , the messages he spreads to his fanbase , and his passion for music .","288273":"i have a collection of mugs ! ! it wasn t an intentional collection by any means , though . i just love buying cute mugs , and then people have seemed to realize that i love mugs too , so they would always gift them to me .","288274":"graduation day . lmaoo .","288275":"i m left handed in general , so everything i do is done with my left hand .","288276":"hello do you have a question ?","288277":"no , there s too much light pollution where i live . i rarely ever see the stars .","288278":"does a nightmare before christmas count as a christmas film ? lol .","288279":"thank you ! ! my coworkers got me a portable charger for my vape because it s always dying on me , lmaoo , a few cards with nice messages written in them , some candy , a mug , and the coworker with whom i work directly in the production of the magazine bought me a really nice bottle of red wine . it was very thoughtful .","288280":"i was happy the day of the impeachment , up until i remembered that the senate is run by republicans and they re not going to remove trump from office , it s as simple as that . obviously impeachment is a step in the right direction , and i m glad that these changes are occurring , but i don t personally believe anything will come of this .","288281":"being transphobic isn t a personal opinion . it s a violation of human rights to deny the existence or status of someone because of their gender .","288282":"trump has already been impeached by the house of representatives . however , that doesn t mean he s been removed from office there still needs to be a trial through the senate for them to determine whether or not he ll be removed . other presidents who have been impeached in the past simply resigned from their positions . i doubt highly trump will do this . if he s removed from office by the senate , then i do believe pence will become president because he s the next in line , so to speak .","288283":"i m pretty content at the moment , actually . i woke up about minutes ago , and i m just sitting at my laptop and drinking some coffee .","288284":"he died , like two years ago . lmaoo .","288285":"i m not sure if that s healthy ? especially considering it s so often . if it s about the same things over over again and no one is learning , then that s generally a bad thing .","288286":"mad max fury road , django unchained , deadpool , and black swan are a few of my favorite movies from the past decade ! !","288287":"no , that isn t something that interests me greatly . plus , i think i have a terrible speaking voice and i don t have much range at all .","288288":"i honestly can t remember most of them , lmaoo . the only one i remember is that we first had sex four months into the relationship .","288289":"it would depend on a lot of circumstances , i . e . whether or not i thought their partner was a good person , how long they ve been dating , their chemistry together , etc etc . if i genuinely liked their partner and thought they would be an excellent parent , then i would consider allowing them to move in until my child and their partner could find their own place to live .","288290":"i would say that my social levels are pretty equal when it comes to my online presence versus my irl presence . when i need to be left alone , i ignore social media and focus on me time , which also includes barely talking to friends for a temporary period of time . however , when i m feeling social , then i m usually perusing social media a lot and texting my friends and trying to make plans with them .","288291":"put my phone in the freezer when i was holding it in one hand while taking out the tray of ice cubes with the other hand , lmaoo .","288292":"i m not sure of the race of a lot of the musicians i listen to because i ve never looked them up , appearance wise . but i do listen to a lot of female singers and female fronted bands .","288293":"i ve only used a bath bomb once in my life , and i really didn t enjoy it because i realized in that moment that i didn t like taking baths . i found it super boring after like minutes , lmaoo . plus , i didn t realize there were sparkles in the bath bomb , so my tub was covered in glitter for weeks . i m not sure if it did anything to the plumbing , tbh . it happened so long ago .","288294":"as horrible as this may sound , being around my family is what i dislike the most . i much prefer spending the holidays with my friends and or my boyfriend and his family .","288295":"honestly , yeah . which is why i m scrambling to finish my christmas shopping , because i only realized a few days ago that christmas is less than seven days away .","288296":"oh , most definitely ! ! i would spend my time painting , reading , drawing , etc etc . i lived in an era when i was much younger when the internet was starting out fresh , and i rarely used the computer or even had a cell phone . i m sure i could find plenty of hobbies to occupy my time .","288297":"lol . i honestly keep forgetting how far into the s we are , because i ve always considered the s to be only years ago . apparently this sentiment is shared by many . entering doesn t sway me any particular way , although it does freak me out that people who were born after the s are adults now .","288298":"i m pretty relaxed happy rn ! ! at work today , we exchanged some gifts and i received a few gifts of appreciation for all of the work i do from some of my coworkers which i wasn t expecting . they were all really thoughtful , and it made me feel valued as an employee .","288299":"i don t believe so , no . i ve only ever had three jobs .","288300":"i sing aloud every night while driving home from work . it s cathartic for me , it releases all of the frustration from the day s work and i find it therapeutic .","288301":"my roommate has youtube premium for music streaming , and he says he likes it a lot . he also doesn t get any ads for any other videos he wants to watch , as well . personally , i use spotify . i like the fact that they make playlists catered to what you already listen to and show you new music within the same genres that you haven t heard before . they also make pretty good playlists of stuff you do listen to that sound well together .","288302":"idk , i purchased the vip program using some of my coins and it was activated the following day or two .","288303":"android , by default . i ve never owned an iphone before .","288304":"she s basically under fire rn because she s defending someone who s wildly transphobic .","288305":"i usually take robitussin , that eases coughs as well as general sinus congestion . throat lozenges are helpful , as well . if you re going for a more homeopathic route , then drink green tea with honey .","288306":"this is amusing that you believe two people out of the entirety of askfm think that the impeachment was a step in the right direction , lmaoo . particularly given that my post has over likes on it rn . guaranteed most of those people agree with the sentiment .","288307":"the other day at work , i went to plug my phone charger into the usb port on the computer . i must have used the wrong port , somehow , because suddenly my monitor screen started flashing bright lights , like a strobe light , and my entire computer shut itself down . it was so bizarre .","288308":"i ve never heard of that theory before , actually .","288309":"i believe i only regifted something once in my life , but it was years ago . i don t usually regift anything , and i like the presents i give to be unique .","288310":"no , why would that be offensive ?","288311":"i m not quite sure where the connection occurs between someone being non binary and doing basic household chores , but all right .","288312":"being transgender non binary isn t a mental illness , actually . it s simply someone s gender identity and people who are trans can be both neurotypical and neuroatypical .","288313":"i don t really know the difference between regular sugar and refined sugar , so idk .","288314":"people are non binary because they feel neither man nor woman .","288315":"? ? ? who said i was ungrateful to live here ? lmaoo . i said i disagreed with his viewpoints , which are oppressive . that has no bearing on my gratitude to have my own house and job and ability to live .","288316":"it doesn t say all , but it is important to shake hands with your interviewer .","288317":"lmaoo . i have a class ring , but i honestly have no idea where it is . i never actually wore it .","288318":"first impressions mean a lot when it comes to job interviews . if you go to a job interview in jeans , then it shows you don t really care about the job or how you re appearing to your potential bosses . i know that really , appearance shouldn t matter . but that s just the way the world works right now .","288319":"hello do you have a question ?","288320":"my inbox is nearly empty ! ! ask me anything","288321":"i don t remember my political beliefs before i started perusing the internet as an adult , but i m sure my beliefs now are much different than how they used to be . that s something natural that happens as people grow older and discover new things about themselves , about society , about education in general , etc etc . i m pretty steadfast in most of my political beliefs , but i m also open to hearing other viewpoints , especially if i m not as educated on something as i previously thought i was .","288322":"it s weird , because my taste in food fluctuates a lot . i used to hate ketchup , but now i enjoy dipping french fries in ketchup on occasion . on the contrary , i enjoy ginger tea and other ginger ish drinks , but when i tried a moscow mule the other night , i absolutely hated it .","288323":"my most embarrassing experience isn t appropriate to discuss on askfm , lmaoo . however a more appropriate embarrassing moment was perhaps when i farted , super loudly on accident , at the dinner table with my boyfriend and his family . it was earlier in our relationship and i was absolutely mortified .","288324":"idk , but i tried pork rinds the other day and it was a very interesting experience . i didn t think i would enjoy them as much as i did , lmaoo .","288325":"i don t really have an answer to this question because i don t know if anything i have the ability of doing can be considered sensational .","288326":"over an open fire ! ! not only are you experiencing the unique sensation of sitting next to an open , controlled fire , but roasted marshmallows are delicious .","288327":"i think the current cancel culture is pretty problematic , especially with respect to resurfacing past discrepancies from years ago . people grow and change as they get older , and just because someone was problematic in the past doesn t necessarily mean they are now but still , people cancel them even if they have grown and changed , and i don t think it s fair . we re all problematic to some degree , anyhow . but if someone is currently being problematic , whether it s through racism or sexism or homophobia transphobia or ableism , then yeah cancelling someone is totally valid . especially if they haven t learned of their mistakes , accepted they made a mistake , apologized , and tried to do better .","288328":"i would have done more for others , said more for others , etc etc . i feel as if i ve lost time with people who were precious to me because i took advantage of my time spent with them , time that i cannot get back . and sometimes it weighs on my mind at night .","288329":"strips of grilled chicken , pesto sauce , tomatoes , and mozzarella in a panini press .","288330":"i m ashamed to have previously called j . k . rowling my writing idol inspiration , because these days she s honestly a piece of sh t human being and i wish i wasn t so influenced by her writing earlier in my life .","288331":"eh , it ultimately depends on my mood . there are some moments where i m super competitive , while other times i cower in the face of opposition .","288332":"i ve experienced a lot of heartbreak heartache throughout my lifetime , mainly because i feel things so strongly most of the time and so any minor hit impacts me significantly . it has normally occurred in a relationship context , but i ve also been heartbroken over lost friendships as well . honestly , i haven t learned much from them besides that maybe i m a much stronger person than i ve believed myself to be . regardless of what i ve endured , i ve always bounced back with extra motivation and have worked towards my goals in spite of my pain .","288333":"people should be able to get abortions for whichever reason they desire with no restriction . abortions are a health care concern , and the government should never infringe upon someone s health and wellness .","288334":"it s been quite a few years , tbh . i believe the last time i went without my phone for almost an entire day was when my boyfriend and i went on vacation a few years ago we had no obligations or responsibilities , and so we left our cell phones in the hotel room while we perused the town and visited various restaurants , bars , and shops .","288335":"it depends entirely on what it is , haha . there are some things that i give up on immediately , but there are other things that i ll literally tear the house apart in order to find . i ve noticed , however , that sometimes when you stop looking for something , it turns up randomly . at times , i ll take that approach and see if it works . lmaoo .","288336":"i ve never seen anyone put a train set underneath a christmas tree before , but it sounds like a really cute idea .","288337":"honestly , christmas is a difficult time of the year for me because of various family factors . so i never look forward to christmas . however , this year i m mainly excited to be spending an entire week off from work . i feel as if it would be a great way to recoup from the long year , and then i can start fresh in .","288338":"my go to partner would obviously be my boyfriend if a zombie apocalypse were to occur . i would have no qualms with leaving everyone else behind . it s one of those every man for himself situations .","288339":"i have various favorite television shows , but the most significant downhill slope happened while i was watching supernatural , lol . it was a great show in the very beginning for a few seasons , but after a while , it became unnecessarily complicated and it made me lose interest .","288340":"i don t generally get into the holiday spirit anymore . but it does make me feel festive when i m wrapping gifts for my friends and family , and the anticipation of seeing their faces light up when they open their gift .","288341":"i haven t stolen anything in quite a while . i stole things mainly between the ages of and , i was notorious for stealing minor things from stores and even my own workplace simply to see if i could get away with it .","288342":"it would be wonderful if i could magically lose pounds before happens , lmaoo . i haven t been exercising , so my weight had remained stagnant these past few months . i initially wanted to lose a lot of weight in light of the cruise i m going on next year , but i guess that s not happening anymore .","288343":"ily too , friend .","288344":"i know quite a few people born in december , including one of my aunts , one of my cousins , an old childhood friend , and a few people i graduated high school with . i m not a december baby . my birthday was last month .","288345":"i would rather have hot apple cider right now . unfortunately , there s none in the house . i have hot chocolate , but it s sometimes too sweet for my liking and it would upset my stomach this late at night .","288346":"i only enjoy getting compliments from people i know trust . most other compliments just make me uncomfortable .","288347":"i have a mildly busy week , but nothing too substantial . after work tomorrow , i m going grocery shopping and i also need to pick up a few gift cards for christmas . on saturday , i m most likely going to my parents house to help out with a few things . and i have a doctor s appointment on sunday .","288348":"the last time i sneezed was this afternoon at work . the last time i lit a candle was minutes ago it s burning now smells so yummy . the last time i took a bubble bath was probably years ago . the last time i hugged someone was tuesday night . the last time i sang was tonight while driving home from work . the last time i drew something was perhaps last year .","288349":"i love certain people in my life significantly . i love my creative outlets , such as writing and music . i love learning new things and being educated on particular subjects . i love sleeping in and not having to worry about obligations or responsibilities , even if it s very temporarily .","288350":"chicken noodle soup , scrambled eggs , pasta , and macaroni and cheese .","288351":"oh , i forgot that disagreeing with someone s political viewpoints that are mainly oppressive obviously means i shouldn t be allowed the freedom to stay in my home country .","288352":"stumbling upon a nice sum of money would be nice . but a more realistic option would be that i get another raise in a few months .","288353":"my most productive times are in the early morning when i just clock into work . the work i do between am and am is usually the most amount of work per hour that i get done throughout the day .","288354":"lmaoo , yes ! ! it looks absolutely hilarious .","288355":"it s a simple method of birth control if a couple does not want children .","288356":"most of the music i listen to is relaxing music , particularly while i m working or on my laptop at the end of a long day . i listen to instrumental soundtracks to video games , television shows , and movies .","288357":"whenever i m bored , i find something interesting to watch on television . or if i m feeling creative , then i ll paint or draw or write . i also spend a lot of time listening to music .","288358":"happy impeachment day , friends . ?","288359":"you re right , the audio does suck but damn her voice is outstanding . i love halestorm too .","288360":"no , omg . i ll look it up now ! !","288361":"broken by seether amy lee . idk , i ve always loved amy s strong vocals and i can get a grasp on them well . it s also one of my all time favorite songs .","288362":"alternative rock and nu metal ! !","288363":"i wholeheartedly believe in re testing people as they get older , maybe once every years or so . my roommate got into a small fender bender the other night because this elderly woman was trying to make a u turn down the block while my roommate was driving down the block , and she claimed she had the right of way even though she was pulled over and was going to make the u turn . smh . people don t even know the basic rules anymore .","288364":"yeah , but i haven t had them in years .","288365":"i haven t been to many places at all , so i wouldn t really know a place i loved so much that i would like to live there for the following year . i ve always wanted to travel cross country and see different states and environments , and even abroad to europe , but i don t know enough about these areas to be comfortable saying that i would live there .","288366":"i honestly wouldn t know i don t notice if people delete me or not . i post memes and such , but i don t post so actively on facebook that i would notice if someone would stop interacting completely unless we were already close .","288367":"yeah , that happens occasionally when i order birthday and or christmas gifts , particularly if it s something off of etsy that s unique or homemade .","288368":"littlesha i appreciate morgan because she accepts me unconditionally , listens to me when i need to vent , and understands me completely whenever i have a hard time articulating something that s going on in my life . i really value our friendship and i feel like i can tell her anything .","288369":"acceptance of others in light of our differences , whether that s due to race , gender identity , sexual orientation , ability disability , etc etc .","288370":"what i appreciate the most about the internet is that there s endless information and education available at your fingertips . if you need to learn more about something , you can easily search it online and come upon a plethora of information .","288371":"i took this photo years ago on top of the montauk lighthouse .","288372":"i discussed christmas eve dinner with my mother last night , and we re probably ordering italian food , lmaoo . my brother always wants a pizza , and i ll probably order raviolis or lasagna or penne a la vodka .","288373":"all of the parents i follow are good parents , in my opinion . i m only really close to littlesha , youcuntx , and psyquietrist , though .","288374":"i m pretty neutral about , tbh . it s going to be one of those horrible yet great years , much like any other year that has its ups and downs .","288375":"i would choose skyrim , without a doubt . it s been around for over six years , and i still love playing it every time i turn it on .","288376":"i love action movies , so definitely yay . i find most of the ones i ve watched to be quite thrilling , especially if they re pretty graphic and ruthless .","288377":"sleeping , of course . it s the only hobby i have that i can t get enough of . sleeping is a beautiful thing when i can get it .","288378":"my iced coffee was a bit too sweet for me this morning , so it made me feel rather nauseous . i felt horrible , but i dumped about half of it out in order to make a cup of tea instead .","288379":"i know people who are bitchy by nature in general men , women , non binary folks , etc etc .","288380":"yeah , i haven t worn it since i moved in though

my best friend s mother s house .","288462":"no , i disagree with the death penalty . i think it s inhumane .","288463":"not usually , no . he has his own mental health issues , but he s generally more stable than me .","288464":"unlikely . i don t know if i want children at all .","288465":"of course in that case , then the feeling is both mutual and consensual .","288466":"yes , that would bother me greatly . i value my loyalty to my friends above most other things , and if they don t believe me or think i m loyal , then that would be a conversation worth having .","288467":"depends on what it is i m arguing about , tbh . if it s a topic that i m solid about , then i can be perceived as stubborn because of how much i do believe in my stance . however , if i do recognize that there are flaws in my argument , then i have no issue with confronting the person again and reconsidering what i previously said .","288468":"at this point in my life and in our relationship , probably not . i would end the relationship if he went behind my back and cheated on me not simply because of the physical aspect of having s x with someone else , but more because it would be an indication that he doesn t care about me or my feelings as much as he says he does , especially to go out of his way to betray me in such a way .","288469":"i already touched upon this in my last answer . it s something we considered a long time ago , but then reconsidered . we re just monogamous right now .","288470":"no , quite the opposite actually . he s always been incredibly understanding and reassuring of my mental health problems , and he understands that my insecurities stem from my own past and ingrained thoughts that i ve never been good enough .","288471":"no , it s something we reconsidered a while ago . i wouldn t be comfortable with being in a polyamorous relationship and it would only make my jealousy worse , considering i already have my own issues with self esteem and abandonment fears .","288472":"polyamory has been around for far longer than feminism has been around , actually . and yes , i did say that in the past . i m in a monogamous relationship , but i was open at one point to polyamory if i felt that my partner wasn t happy s xually with me .","288473":"ah , okay i thought you meant allowing or not allowing your partner to do stuff in a general sense , which is obviously controlling behavior . in monogamous relationships , then yes sleeping with someone who isn t your partner can be construed as cheating . i don t personally think there s anything wrong with polyamory , but it is what it is . obviously we have no common ground here .","288474":"we met through a mutual friend when i was years old .","288475":"i feel limited at times , as if i m being held back from doing what it is i need to do to be a successful partner , and that s largely due to my mental health issues . i ve always sought to be a better person than i have been previously , but i know that sometimes i m misguided and can fall short . i do genuinely believe he can find someone better than me , lmaoo . that comes from my own insecurities about myself , though .","288476":"? ? ? when did i say that monogamy was ab sive . . . ? i m in a monogamous relationship myself , lol . if you re in a monogamous relationship , or a polyamorous relationship , then consent is crucial to pretty much anything . but the idea of not allowing your partner to do certain things in their life is controlling i wasn t talking about going out and having s x with others . your partner isn t your property and you don t hold the reigns to their life . we will have to agree to disagree , but please bare in mind that polyamorous relationships have always existed and will continue to exist , and as long as the people involved in those relationships are happy and consenting , then it shouldn t be anyone else s concern .","288477":"i agree . that s why i said most forms of jealousy are toxic , not that it makes a person toxic . i experience jealousy in a lot of different ranges of my life , and yes it s very unhealthy for me , but it doesn t make me a toxic person .","288478":"we ve been together for years .","288479":"i had an active plan for s icide , and it scared me . instead of acting on my plan , i decided to reach out and see my primary care physician to prescribe me medication , refer me to a psychiatrist , and assign me counseling .","288480":"well , if i m not a great partner then he certainly hasn t informed me , lmaoo . i d like to think that i m a good partner to my boyfriend , but i m also hyper critical of myself and believe that i can always do more , be more .","288481":"ish years ago , so i was around the age of when i was initially diagnosed . however , they ve been present since i was a teenager .","288482":"i think most forms of jealousy is toxic , and it can definitely lead to problems in marriage that might end up in divorce . if you re insecure with your relationship or not trusting of your spouse to the point where you re jealous of other people in their lives , then that s very unhealthy .","288483":"no , people who cheat in relationships are not evil people . evil has a very negative connotation and is usually reserved for those who are senseless , remorseless k llers and people in that regard . on the other hand , those who cheat on their partners aren t evil misguided and in the wrong , of course , but definitely not evil .","288484":"yes , that is indeed the purpose of askfm . i ve been using this website for going on years , at this point . lol .","288485":"in a healthy relationship , you don t allow or not allow your partner to do things that s overly controlling and can be a red flag for ab sive behavior . your partner should have the freedom to do what to do . in terms of polyamorous relationships , it isn t the idea of allowing someone to date another person . it s consensual activity and both parties are free to date whomever they choose . people aren t property . in addition , being effeminate and emotional does not make someone less of a man either . we re all human beings , we re all creatures of emotion , and we re all free to express ourselves in whichever way we choose . if the idea of a man being emotional is off putting to you , then that s your prerogative in terms of dating . but you shouldn t judge other people for the way they behave or express themselves simply because it isn t your exact lifestyle .","288486":"uh , are you asking me personally or the anon ? lmaoo . i have mental illnesses as well , which includes major depressive disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , panic disorder in remission , for the most part , and borderline personality disorder .","288487":"i don t really know how to answer this because you re giving me little information . however , i can say this relationships are built off of communication and trust , and there s no use in blaming someone for something that happened in the past that you cannot change in the now . the best thing to do , in any circumstance , is to sit down with your partner and have a serious discussion about your communication issues , and how to make them better . which includes your hesitance to talk about your mental health and everything in between .","288488":"my eyes look so pretty after i take my makeup off , lmaoo .","288489":"i don t recall most of my dreams when i awaken , unfortunately . i only have vague ideas of them that soon disappear from memory after about or so minutes .","288490":"it s unfortunate that you believe in these things , because toxic masculinity is the source of high rates of mental illness in men mainly because it isn t seen as manly for men to discuss their feelings , which in turn leads to higher rates of male s icide . you re correct in that no one takes it seriously , but it isn t something only moronic people care about . it s studied upon extensively by academic scholars and can be a great source of distress for several different types of men .","288491":"cont . . . i may not know a whole heap about it but i ll always try and be understanding about someone else s struggles and am always open ears if you should ever need it . i know you don t know me personally but i m always willing to help out wherever i possible can . aw , thank you that s really sweet of you to say and offer . i do have my bad days where i genuinely think i m sh t and weak and whatnot , but most of the time i do know that i m a strong person because of how i ve coped with what i ve endured . i really appreciate you reaching out ! !","288492":"yes , this defines most of my work days , tbh .","288493":"yes , i have a few coworkers whom i would also consider a friend . we hang out outside of work sometimes .","288494":"considering i just woke up , i ll talk about my day from yesterday , lol . yesterday was fun i had my holiday party for my job last night , and it was probably the most fun work party i ve been to so far ! ! it took place in this venue that s supposed to sorta resemble a speakeasy , and it was very classy but also unique . i had a great time with my coworkers , we were singing and dancing and having a few drinks .","288495":"right now , it s degrees fahrenheit sunny .","288496":"no , i don t believe i ve ever watched that before .","288497":"thanks to previous experiences with the birth control pill , my menstrual cycle is pretty light and i only need to change my pad twice per day . my cycle lasts days at the most . the only thing that s debilitating about my period is that i get horrible cramps right before my period comes . in the past , i ve had to call in sick to school or call out of work because the pain was so bad .","288498":"? ? ? some people are polyamorous there s nothing wrong with that at all , as long as everyone is consenting to the activity . if he s happy , then who cares ? this is a prime example of toxic masculinity , this message right here . men don t have to behave a certain way in order to be perceived as a man .","288499":"work christmas party makeup .","288500":"shehitsback isn t old , nor is she arrogant . she treats others the way that they deserve to be treated , and if she was strict with you , then you deserved it .","288501":"not particularly , no . especially if none of their significant others were invited either . if it was just a family event , then that s understandable .","288502":"if the relationships are polyamorous and are all consensual , then i see nothing wrong with that . i have a good friend who s married and also has a boyfriend , and they all live together .","288503":"what would you like to know then ? i ve never been discouraging about my menstrual cycle in the past , i m open about most things in my life .","288504":"i don t really care very much about sex .","288505":"it s only pm , but my day is going well . i just got nuzzled on the forehead by a kitty , which made me very happy .","288506":"the idea seems pretty oppressive , tbh . diversity should happen naturally , and it seems a bit peculiar to forcefully enforce diversity in order to reach a quota of individuals . it s sorta the same concept as universities accepting students of different races solely due to their race , not because of their academic abilities .","288507":"i heard the term in the past , but didn t feel the need to really look into it , so i m mostly unfamiliar with the theory . however , i just read up briefly on it and it s definitely a very interesting theory that may be beneficial to those struggling with mental health issues if the theory is studied more extensively . on the one hand , i do believe that trauma cannot be passed down generation to generation solely due to genetic coding . i believe that the effects of trauma on adults can be passed onto their children due to child rearing behaviors , and the ways that the parents consciously or unconsciously raise their children that could have a detrimental impact on their development . this is more of a first hand trauma , not so much second hand trauma . on the other hand , however , i m obviously not well versed enough in the subject to have a truly educated opinion . there s a lot about it i obviously don t understand .","288508":"my inbox is empty ! ! y all should ask me some questions","288509":"stark contrast of black white . i know those aren t necessarily colors , they re moreso shades , but because of my mental illnesses , i often see things in extremes and my moods are normally in extremes as well .","288510":"i wholeheartedly believe that time is the best way to heal heartache . through time , you begin to develop a sense of understanding and often closure regarding the relationship , and things do get easier as time progresses . it s also important to have a strong support system , whether it s through family , friends , a therapist , etc etc .","288511":"probably bizarre grotesque keychains and pendants for necklaces ! ! skulls , knives , skeletons , etc etc .","288512":"probably a flag or a rainbow , representing bisexuality and or my non binary gender .","288513":"tbh , this already happens to me somewhat . i don t remember anything of my life until the ages of or so , and even those memories of middle school and high school are quite hazy to me .","288514":"i struggle significantly with mental illness . it stems from a past of childhood ab se , as well as genetic factors because mental illness runs in my family . it s influenced me negatively because i developed mood disorders and a personality disorder , which makes everyday tasks seem either insignificant or difficult . i have a hard time with anxiety , especially in the face of stressors that normally wouldn t be a big deal to most other people . i have sensory overload issues , and i can t be around too many people or too many sounds at once . i have really bad memory problems and amnesia , and i have a tendency toward substance ab se .","288515":"spite , more than anything else .","288516":"tolerance , acceptance , the willingness to learn , and passion .","288517":"the smallest things please me . in that regard , the nicest thing a person could do for me is simply listen to me when i m feeling down and offer validation and reassurance when i can t find my own way . it means so much to me when my friends are caring and actually give a sh t about my issues .","288518":"yes ! ! i used to think one of my coworkers was a huge b tch , but as we ve gotten to know each other , we ve become super close and she s one of the nicest and most selfless people i know .","288519":"me at work .","288520":"above most other things , i hope to see medical advancements for the treatment , prevention , and cure of juvenile diabetes .","288521":"there has never really been a staple food item for my christmas dinners with my family , and sometimes we do an italian dinner above all else with pasta , lasagna , etc etc . at my boyfriend s house , his father caters food since there are usually a lot of people who come over .","288522":"a perfect life , in my opinion , is a life that you re totally content with and all of your basic necessities are being fulfilled , i . e . having food on the table , shelter over your head , appropriate clothing for the seasons , enough money to pay bills , and just overall live comfortably .","288523":"i think it s an even combination of both , haha . a lot of my coworkers , for example , are cool and down to earth people . but there are definitely some people i interact with regularly who are assholes or just generally unpleasant people .","288524":"i usually just entertain the person briefly while giving off a stern impression that their advice isn t appreciated , and then i end the conversation as soon as possible .","288525":"nas ne dagoniat by t . a . t . u . https www .

.","288528":"uh , luck ? haha . it also includes hard work , as well . but luck is a major component to where i am today , because it was by chance that i was able to find the jobs i ve been able to find with the little experience i had in the past .","288529":"the only things that can cheer me up when i need is most are my boyfriend s encouragement and support . it means so much to me when he s able to talk me down from a bad mood or rationalize my thoughts for me .","288530":"this is probably my favorite picture that i ve taken on my new phone so far .","288531":"i believe it was back in august , at my office building where i work . they evacuated everyone floor by floor , and when we left the office , the fire commissioner was there teaching us certain things about which exits to use and whatnot .","288532":"about an hour or so , but it all depends on how special the event is to me . i have a work party tonight , so it s probably going to take me about an hour to shower , get dressed , do my hair and makeup , etc etc . if i m just going out to see friends somewhere , then minutes maximum . in those cases , i just throw on some nice clothing , freshen up in the bathroom , and leave .","288533":"no , i don t believe i have . the audience interaction stuff sorta scares me , so my friend and i have been arriving a bit late so that we re not seated anywhere close to the comedian , lmaoo .","288534":"yes ! ! one of my close friends is really into comedy and stand up acts , so she s been taking me to all of these different comedy shows over the past few months . they ve all been great .","288535":"i wouldn t leave askfm , but i would definitely reconsider the relationship . controlling your partner s social media usage is very manipulative and a red flag for future ab sive behavior , and i wouldn t want to be in a hostile environment like that anymore .","288536":"last tuesday night , when i went into manhattan to see a comedy show . it was a really fun time .","288537":"i ve been quite partial to comedy shows lately . i prefer the idea of having experiences as opposed to material gifts these days .","288538":"i ve never watched the polar express

christmas tree ! !","288544":"not any more than usual , lol . i don t over eat or anything during the holiday season .","288545":"i like trying different things within a reasonable range . if

i do know she will love the blanket .","288566":"no , not at all . periods should not be stigmatized , and the more that women and other people who get periods talk about their menstrual cycle , the more people will be open , understanding , and knowledgeable towards it .","288567":"i only know how to speak english .","288568":"a giant x inch fleece blanket that has assassin s creed logos and characters on it .","288569":"yes , i filed a dispute through paypal in order for me to get a refund .","288570":"no . i live in the suburbs of new york , lol .","288571":"yes . . . that s the root of

ask me questions . i m bored af","288577":"spending fuckin money on a product on etsy when the shop was unreliable and disappeared after i placed the order . throws everything off of my desk","288578":"my answer is inappropriate for askfm , so . . . lmaoo .","288579":"i ve never been a frivolous spender on myself , so it depends on the item . some days i ll feel the need to splurge , but most times i would rather spend the money on someone else .","288580":"it depends entirely on circumstance . i m not a forgiving person by nature , but i did forgive my boyfriend for cheating on me when he did so much earlier in our relationship . i believe it it happened now , i wouldn t be so apt to forgive .","288581":"i honestly can t remember the last time i took a break from the internet , lol . the internet has always been a place for me to escape from my real life .","288582":"grammar , haha . especially considering i m a writer editor as a profession , and in the beginning of my current job , i spent all of my time proofreading and copyediting other people s work .","288583":"lol , no . i haven t been in a kiss cam before thankfully . i would be so anxious for being on camera in the first place .","288584":"my boyfriend , lmaoo .","288585":"rolling stone , probably . i used to read rolling stone a lot when i was younger , and i wanted to be a journalist for them at one point .","288586":"idk , probably wakes funerals especially if the family isn t so keen on humor to begin with .","288587":"no , i m absolutely miserable around the holidays especially the process of figuring out which gifts to buy my friends and family and spending the money to do so . i love watching them open the gifts and seeing their reactions , but i find the process beforehand so stressful .","288588":"i believe i ve been in love twice in my entire life .","288589":"i would likely use it to sleep , lmaoo .","288590":"my phone , sitting calmly on the dark wood desk with an amazon gift card laying beside it . the light from my lamp is shining off of the screen with an amber glow .","288591":"because i wanted to , obviously .","288592":"tbh , it depends on the day . sometimes it s only one or two while other times it s between and questions . there are a variety of random people who ask me spam questions , as well as anons , so it varies wildly .","288593":"i remember using askfm when i was in college , so it s been since at least for me .","288594":"i received in the mail the stickers i ordered for my coworker for christmas . she s obsessed with quoting vines , so i bought her a pack of five vine stickers and they re adorable .","288595":"ranch dressing .","288596":"ah , i haven t really checked the app all day today . i was at work and then i just

product , they re located in brooklyn so i m hoping they can rush ship it ."}}
