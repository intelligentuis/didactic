your anon . anyway i m out .","305508":"lol you are clearly so done with the gender conversation","305509":"nope you just implanted that idea in your head since you have dysphoria","305510":"yes i m a female but i m not a girl lmaooo i mean i guess i understand that a trans man can be a biological female and not be called a woman but it s just funny to me , the mental gymnastics of it . it s almost as if they try to defy logic . ? yeah this soo respectful . trans have feelings .","305511":"btw what i said on my page wasn t about you or anyone specifically at all , i didn t even know you were discussing it last night !","305512":"another anon being non binary is overrated . you are cis gender , you have a bf and you are not transgender and you actually have female body parts so stick with being a female fgs no offence","305513":"would be friends with someone who s openly racist ?","305514":"so apparently agreeing to disagree , being mature , and not entertaining drama is you kissing my asx now , lol . who knew . sorry about your failed attempt to start beef tho anon","305515":"she attacked other trans . there s no difference between her and someone who s openly being racist .","305516":"as society and language changed , it now refers to a person s gender this statement is incorrect and illogical . i just proved to you using the birth example that pronouns refer to sex . i showed you that pronouns universally refer to sex since gender is different . i showed you how this is logical .","305517":"i lost all respect for you now . you are literally kissing her axs . did you even her opinions regrading trans ?","305518":"lol liar . you used to get sassy when someone calls she on here . you recently changed your attitude .","305519":"wow . your story changed btw , first you said pronouns referred to gender not sex , and then you changed your story to say society changed . it did change in that some people decided pronouns should refer to gender instead of sex . it never did and doesn t make sense , but if you don t get logic . . .","305520":"do your friends refer to you as she or them in real life ?","305521":"omg , i knew someone would try it lmao ? just to clarify , like i said before i will always respect everyone s pronouns regardless of my own personal thoughts and feelings about it , and obviously i respect and like you a lot as an individual and would never go out of my way to be disrespectful .","305522":"again . . . that s not how logic works . , the earth goes around the sun . and there is no subjective interpretation or power play involved in that . our world has real facts , and real truths , and if you don t naturally buy into that then we have problems a lot more serious than pronouns .","305523":"logic is can be subjective . no , that s not how logic works . , it will never subjectively be .","305524":"btw that was a trick question , because science and studies have nothing to do with it . it s about history and logic . history most societies have had different and changing ideas about gender . logic pronouns refer to sex , not gender . sex is universal , gender is not . and no society hasn t changed .","305525":"what did the studies actually say ? can you name one off the top of your mind without googling ?","305526":"how many of those studies have you read ?","305527":"well , gender actually doesn t come up at all , because it s not about gender . gender is like clothing , it changes from place to place , and it changes across time . nobody has bothered to come up with terms for it because it s realized that a man is a man , regardless of his gender . that s history .","305528":"people in real life or online ?","305529":"lmao but online sources when credible are accepted in like every citation format . . . if it wasn t real research why is it academically accepted ?","305530":"do you think you will grow out of this phase ? following trends ? ? ?","305531":"yes , but i m sure your sources , whatever they were , weren t based on actual history . i know the actual history . and here s a simple logical exercise when a doctor or midwife delivers a baby , and they slap his ass and say it s a boy ! how are they making the call that it s a boy ?","305532":"how hard is it for you to cut someone out from your life ?","305533":"are you a forgiving person ?","305534":"ahh ,

talking to me . i haven t done anything wrong . school hasn t been a good experience for me , now i m blaming myself starting to think that i m not a likeable person , are people becoming mean or its just me","305561":"regardless of how you feel about gender , the concept of pronouns refers to sex , not gender . if you care about education then you can educate yourself about the history of the concept . you may wish to find some other way of asserting the social idea you call non binary .","305562":"i don t understand this nonbinary nonsense . there are two genders woman and man . trans women are women . trans men are men . i ve never heard a trans person say i m a non binary , please use neutral pronouns .","305563":"you watched the movie ? ? ?","305564":"oh wow , ive already wanted

filter ?","305590":"from , how good are you at swimming ?","305591":"why do you make such a big deal to make a distinction between sex and gender ? most people dont go through these mental gymantics when referring to someone . i guarantee that even the people who refer to you as they them still think of you as she her in their mind .","305592":"and this is where you re confused . if you look back across time and across cultures , there have often been people who don t fit the cultural stereotypes for a certain gender . but they re still considered male or female , because they are genetically male or female . look it up .","305593":"i respect your gender , sure , but again , the pronouns refer to your sex , not your gender . in your case , the words refer to your sex , which is female .","305594":"so leigh is a woman . she is a woman . you can refer to her as a woman , even though she identifies with a purely social construct of non binarism .","305595":"well , male and female are

and i went to the zoo in central park in manhattan . after that trip , i vowed to never go to another zoo , unless it was a sanctuary . the animals looked so miserable and it made me so upset .","305251":"i appreciate it , my dude","305252":"lol , it s okay ! ! i don t think i have it advertised on facebook either .","305253":"aw , thank youu ! ! my boyfriend took me out to a wine beer tasting event at the aquarium last night , so we got to walk around the aquarium , look at all the fish and sharks , and sample really delicious wine , beer , and food . he booked a hotel room not too far away from the aquarium , so we walked back and ended up spending the night there ! ! we just got home a few hours ago . tomorrow , i m just going out to dinner with my immediate family , my aunt , and my cousin . i think we re going to the olive garden .","305254":"neither . i prefer chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream .","305255":"yes , i eat meat although i don t eat as much meat as i used to in the past . i only eat meat when necessary , and even so , it s usually chicken instead of red meat .","305256":"sometimes , but not often at all . i ll sometimes order bacon on egg sandwiches , but it generally depends on my mood . it also depends on where i m ordering bacon from , because some places crisp their bacon well and other places don t .","305257":"i like potato chips , but i prefer veggie chips because they re healthier . the only potato chip i like more than veggie chips are cool ranch doritos , lol . i have a giant bag of them rn actually , i bought them last night as a drunk snack for my boyfriend and i , but we ended up falling asleep immediately .","305258":"no . as i discussed earlier this morning or perhaps last night , i can t remember , i don t like any sports .","305259":"a gamer is a person who likes to play video games .","305260":"no . earlier this morning , i said that i only owned an xbox one .","305261":"i prefer tattoos which is why i have so many tattoos zero piercings at the moment , lol . tattoos are an intricate art form , and i love giving the artist free reign over what they want to do in terms of style and color . i usually give my artist a general idea of what i want , and i let her draw up something using her own creativity .","305262":"i like pizza , but it isn t anything special to me . if i get it , i usually order a grandma or margherita slice .","305263":"if there was absolutely no justifiable reason behind it , then i would probably break up with him in that scenario too . at that point , that s cold calculated m rder . if it was something like self defense , then obviously that s an entirely different scenario . i would stay with him in that case .","305264":"exactly . any person who uses the whole friendzone thing as an excuse is likely insecure immature af , because they can t accept the fact that someone doesn t want to date them . not everyone is going to want to date you , let alone even like you in the first place . to get offended over someone saying no to you is silly , just move on like everyone else .","305265":"it would depend entirely on the reason why he went to jail . the concept of him going to jail by itself isn t a make or break decision , because there are a lot of bullsh t reasons why someone can be sent to jail . however , if it was something alarming and horrible , like r pe or p dophilia , then i would break up with him instantly .","305266":"no , i don t bother with new years resolutions at all . in the past , i always broke them within the first month anyway , lol . if i want to make a new resolution , then realistically i can start it at any time . waiting for the new year is just giving yourself an excuse to postpone the changes you need to make . if you really set your mind to making a change , there s nothing stopping you from beginning those changes now .","305267":"technically , all of the men in my life are in the friendzone because i m in a relationship already . the friendzone is just a bullsh t excuse that men give when a woman rejects their advances , though . there s really no friendzone , you just have to learn to accept the meaning of no if someone doesn t want to date you .","305268":"you re welcome ! ! if you have any other questions , feel free to ask .","305269":"unfortunately , i ve had to deal with death often in my life , referring to both people and animals . i put up a strong front at the wake and funeral services , but i have a tendency to break down in private after everything has calmed down . the last time i witnessed a death , i didn t cry in the waiting room because i felt like i had to be a source of strength for everyone else , but as soon as we got home , i broke down .","305270":"i don t have a preference . i don t really like receiving flowers as a gift , even though i do appreciate the sentiment behind them . artificial flowers obviously last longer , but real flowers are usually prettier . it doesn t much matter to me .","305271":"no , i don t . i don t generally like xmas as a holiday , but i do enjoy buying and giving people gifts to open on the holidays . i haven t even started xmas shopping yet , though . i need to pay off some of my credit cards , and then i ll probably start shopping in weeks .","305272":"the person you asked is correct you re referring to the people in that construction , so it should go . . . who share the same interests . if the noun you were referring to was a thing , you could use that . i . e . i like to collect toys that remind me of

going to be around .","305276":"no , i never got suspended from school before . i was a quiet , low key student when i was a teenager and i never got into trouble . school was pretty much a safe haven for me .","305277":"there s a lot of disregard for new wave feminists in online communities , and i don t feel comfortable adhering the label of feminist to myself because unfortunately people didn t take me seriously when i prefaced my opinions with the idea that i was a feminist . white and liberal feminism is pretty much the face of feminism these days , and their core beliefs don t define what i believe or what i am . i don t want to associate myself with that form of the movement . i still have many of the same beliefs as i did when i labeled myself as an intersectional feminist , but i just don t throw the label around anymore .","305278":"absolutely not . if your relationship is based exclusively on money , then your relationship is empty and foundation less . there s so much more that goes into relationships than how each partner handles their finances . in my opinion , it s pretty shallow to date someone solely because they make a lot of money .","305279":"i haven t watched a horror movie since i was a teenager , so i don t really have any idea . most horror movies scare me a lot and make my paranoia worse , especially if i watch them alone , so i avoid them at this point .","305280":"i don t recall my childhood , so i can t objectively say whether or not that part of my life was good or bad . i simply can t remember anything prior to the age of . my teenagehood was extremely difficult , and if it wasn t for the support of two specific friends , i wouldn t have survived . i endured a lot of abvse , which has even altered my behavior as an adult . after the age of and beyond , my life has been substantially better . i ve had good opportunities and i ve worked my a s off to make money and obtain a good education . i have a good job and an amazing support system , and things can only look up from here .","305281":"i don t have the healthiest coping mechanisms , so i don t control my anger i just mask it . i seldom get angry , anyway , but the times i do , my anger is usually out of control and nothing calms me down except time .","305282":"i have nightmares occasionally perhaps once every few weeks or so . i remember them upon waking up , but it quickly disappears within a few hours .","305283":"i ve been wonderful lately , actually . the past two days have been a dream because i was able to spend them with my boyfriend , just the two of us with no interruption , and he took me out last night to a wine beer tasting event , which was the most fun i ve had in ages .","305284":"i think they re equally important in different ways . it s important to love because love inspires us and gives us reason to continually grow , and it s often our love for others that motivates us to continue pushing forward . however , it s also important to be loved because we deserve to feel loved , cared for , and appreciated especially if we re going through a particularly hard time . support , validation , and unconditional love are integral to a person s development .","305285":"dovbts always gets the most beautiful anons that rave about his art , it s the best thing i ve ever seen on askfm . misphire has also received a lot of interesting questions

boyfriend bought me the most heartfelt , sincere , cutest gift he s ever given me in our nine years of dating . he personalized a book that tells the story of our love and the things he loves about me

night at a wine and beer tasting event at the local fish aquarium , and now we re packing up our things to leave the hotel and go back home .","305316":"inappropriate questions are questions that relate to sxx , fetishes , or just overly invasive things about my personal life which make me uncomfortable .","305317":"no , not really . if horoscope compatibility was accurate , then my boyfriend i would not be compatible at all , haha . everything says that we re no good for each other and bring out the worst in one another , when that really couldn t be further from the truth .","305318":"i ve been too afraid to watch it by myself lol , so i haven t seen it yet . however , courrtana told me it s really good and that i would really enjoy it ! ! apparently it s right up my alley .","305319":"no , i ve had opportunities to do karaoke , but i ve never sang before . my singing voice is terrible and i would never want to inflict that upon anyone , lol .","305320":"i get push

that would be cheating if i did that behind his back .","305328":"neither boots .","305329":"i m addicted to coffee , and i have a coffee tattoo , so my answer should be obvious .","305330":"that

already have a boyfriend .","305337":"if you re going to try the whole this isnt a mass message thing . . . then maybe don t send them to tons of people who follow each other . lmfaoooo .","305338":"! ! ! you re literally the sweetest human being i ve ever come across . thank you so much for this detailed , thorough , heartfelt response . i had to read it a few times over to really understand everything you wrote in here , but i have to say that you really gave genuine , useful insight into what autism spectrum disorder is for people who don t have experience being around autistic people . you re a strong person for divulging all of this information , but your response is so appreciated and its literally one of the best things i ve ever received on askfm . thank you so , so much .","305339":"ugh , i literally have no idea what to get people this year . i haven t even started thinking about xmas shopping , it s so daunting . i ll probably browse etsy and amazon for ideas in a week or two .","305340":"we usually start decorating two or three weeks before xmas . and we usually leave them up for about two weeks after xmas has ended .","305341":"i d rather lose all of my money . you can always make more money , but the memories that go alongside photos can t be replaced . i ve always relied heavily on photographs to remind me of good memories , because often i can t remember incidents alone . i have at least three or four photo albums full of photos from the past few years .","305342":"this pretty much defines my life , lol . i ve always experienced paranoia , both warranted and unwarranted , and i m constantly afraid that people are watching me .","305343":"i don t generally misspell words , so i can t really think of any . i ve always been terrific at spelling .","305344":"a phoenix . i ve always risen from the ashes of my former failures or hardships to create something new .","305345":"i was years old and a junior in high school . i don t remember much except that i was extremely depressed , svicidal , self harming during that time . it was also when i first started getting into drinking and drugs .","305346":"sometimes , yeah ! ! i haven t watched a new movie in ages though , lol .","305347":"thank you ! ! i m going to wait maybe two hours and see how my street looks . i still have to get ready pack and whatnot anyway

my boyfriend s house tonight , and i m so not looking forward to going back out and driving later .","305350":"it took me over two hours to get home from work , and i only work like miles away from my house . i m so tired of this already lmaoo .","305351":"don t worry guys , it ll be less than an inch . five hours later lol jk look out for five inches and little visibility . five inches isn t much but considering no one was prepared for this and there are no plows out on the road , this is some bullsh t .","305352":"it s way too early in the fuckin season for this shit .","305353":"writer editor . it s also in my bio , lol .","305354":"i don t have any thoughts , i know a lot of people who haven t watched or don t have a desire to watch game of thrones .","305355":"anons will use anything to fuel their own personal agenda , even something as simple as you saying you re cjsgender which has absolutely nothing to do with me , lol .","305356":"thank you ! !","305357":"keep waiting then , i suppose ? ? idk what else to tell you .","305358":"i haven t posted this online yet .","305359":"how is it disrespectful ? ? dovbts didn t even say anything bad about not having social skills . y all are reaching .","305360":"i m proud of misphire for figuring out her identity ! ! it s one of the hardest things for us to wrap our heads around . she s grown leaps and bounds over the years , i m so proud of her . ?","305361":"no , not at all . i m overweight and haven t exercised in months .","305362":"aw , thank you ! !","305363":"i honestly just felt invincible , lmao . like i could do

.","305365":"public intoxication , lmao .","305366":"i got a better grip on my mental health , thanks to therapy finding the right combination of medication . i still have panic attacks , but perhaps one every two or three months . in , especially early , it would be at least once per week . i also haven t had a severe depressive episode in months , and my mood swings are very seldom and not as extreme as they used to be .","305367":"mainly because this is one of my favorite movies .","305368":"lol . because that s just what we did when we were younger . it wasn t a stranger exactly , it was an acquaintance s house , but that was during a time in my life where we would give any excuse to party .","305369":"this anon is so angry for no legitimate reason , lmao . friendships happen naturally . you can t force a friendship to happen , it doesn t work that way .","305370":"who said i was assuming that ? ? i figured you followed me because you saw my answers .","305371":"if you re so offended , then unfollow me .","305372":"that doesn t answer my question , but either way , i ve met more rude people who are in the generation older than me around than people my age younger . the fact that you re so offended by what i m saying and are retaliating proves this , tbh .","305373":"i can guarantee you re from the same generation as me , lmao . how old are you ? ?","305374":"there s nothing i wish to change . there s nothing wrong with not sugar coating things , especially when it comes to something as mild as what i said to you .","305375":"you can t force friendship . you re also anonymous .","305376":"how so ? ?","305377":"you re really determined to prove that my memory is fine , aren t you ? ? i wish i had a better memory . it sucks sometimes to have no idea what people are talking about because you can t remember previous conversations , or the obvious fact that i can t recall my entire childhood .","305378":"i m not answering any more questions about this dude .","305379":"it s been at least five times , but i obviously can t put an exact number to it .","305380":"i have no idea who you are , so i would give you a visa gift card .","305381":"almost everyone i know does it , with the exception of a few people . i also usually use whatever birthday money i get for xmas gifts , so i don t start until december anyway .","305382":"not generally . i work my best when i know i don t have a strict deadline , but i can work at my own pace which is fast anyway . working under stress leads to a greater chance for mistakes , and i can t risk that at my job .","305383":"no , not really . my only tradition is that i always unintentionally wait until the last second to buy gifts for people , lol .","305384":"i would write that i m living in a nice apartment with my boyfriend , we re both happy at our jobs , and we have a cute dog to take care of .","305385":"within the last few years , it was making the decision to leave my last job and start a new job my current job . i was stressed out beyond belief at my last job and would cry every day , but i was terrified of the prospect of starting a new job because of the unknown of how it will be . i decided to go for it anyway , and i m really happy with the outcome . i m not nearly as stressed out as i was one year ago .","305386":"my boyfriend and i were having sxx doing drugs at some random person s house years ago , so we got walked in on a bunch of times , lol .","305387":"if i set my mind to it , then perhaps . i would at least try if the outcome was good enough , lol .","305388":"i ll tag a few , but i m sure you follow them already babycadiex urlsareshittbh shehitsback celinem courrtana lillehjort country peach princess tal manicmartyrdom heartofstitches my name isnt eric dovbts misphire as for my weekend plans , i m going to a wine tasting event with my boyfriend this weekend staying overnight at a hotel within walking distance from the venue ! ! it should be a lot of fun .","305389":"everyone go follow steph s new account ! ! ?","305390":"no ? ? i d tell someone off , but i wouldn t punch them . lmao .","305391":"being wrapped up in blankets with a glass of wine in my hand , while listening to music and talking to my boyfriend .","305392":"much like my answer regarding the xmas tree , i think it should be after thanksgiving .","305393":"after thanksgiving , in my opinion .","305394":"my memory is pretty bad , and there s no rhyme or reason behind why i remember some things and forget others . i think the only reason why i remember the whole frank zappa thing is because it s happened continuously for many months , multiple times .","305395":"everyone follow morgan s new account .","305396":"awesome ! ! if anyone else wants to follow me on twitter , my handle is poetalunam .","305397":"i think i played spyro when i was younger , but i honestly can t remember because that s way too long ago for me to even recall . i have memories of playing crash bandicoot , so i assume i played spyro as well . i think the remastered version is a brilliant idea , though . not only does it bring back nostalgia for adults who played the game on the original console , but it also introduces the game to a brand new audience who will be experiencing it for the first time .","305398":"i mainly watch achievement hunter , rooster teeth , markiplier , chilledchaos , seananners even though he doesn t upload videos anymore , and buzzfeed unsolved .","305399":"i m turned off automatically from all men because they re simply not my boyfriend .","305400":"i enjoy hanging out with my boyfriend the most . he makes me feel the most comfortable , as well as the safest , and we never run out of things to talk about when we re together . even something as simple as sitting down and watching a youtube video together is entertaining because it ll usually bring forth random discussions that lead into deeper things .","305401":"this is an incredibly open ended question , and it would be impossible for me to list everything that s wrong in the world at the moment . climate change has been wrecking havoc on the earth . so little people are being brought to justice for crimes they ve committed . the media has brainwashed most people into focusing on insignificant events while ignoring larger events . social media has taken over people s lives to the point where everyone feels entitled . there s rampant ableism in today s society when it comes to physical mental disabilities , and a lot of it is so ingrained in our culture that most people aren t even aware it exists .","305402":"i m on this on the one hand , i see a lot of progression in terms of science and technology . however , in terms of social reform , i feel as if the world or , at the very least , the united states has halted . the midterm elections have given me a little bit of more hope , but other than that , i m fairly neutral about the future . it could go either way .","305403":"my memory has always been terrible . on top of the amnesia , i also have pretty bad short term memory and i constantly need to set reminders for myself . i have trouble recalling conversations sometimes too .","305404":"i used to know a lot about the history of the united states , but these days , not so much . i haven t taken a history class in eight years .","305405":"i ve posted a few polls , i m pretty sure they were all about what i should do next with my hair , lol . my most recent poll was me deciding between coloring my hair pink purple or blue green , and i think the pink purple had more votes .","305406":"i ve always owned android phones , i can t imagine owning an iphone because it would be too different from what i m used to . however , i do have an ipad and it helped me a lot when i was in college when it came to assignments and writing . i don t have strong opinions about the whole android v . iphone debate because it s all about personal preference .","305407":"yes , and you ve asked me this question a number of times before .","305408":"it would give me way too much anxiety to know when i was going to die , it would permeate everything i do . i d rather not know .","305409":"lately , i ve been using dove body wash and crest toothpaste .","305410":"thank you ! ! i went to the same event a few years ago for my birthday it was so much fun . each winery has a station set up inside the aquarium next to the exhibits so you can drink and walk around and look at the fish all night .","305411":"my boyfriend surprised me this afternoon with tickets to go to a wine tasting event at the local aquarium this weekend for my birthday , and i m so excited . he also booked us a hotel room for the night . i m so happy rn .","305412":"this used to happen to me a lot when i went out more and worked with the general public . while i was working in retail , i would sometimes have customers hitting on me and saying gross things to me , and sometimes it got to the point where i would have to tell them to leave the store . in a casual setting , i ve also had people come up to me and try to flirt with me , but i usually just tell them straight out that their efforts are futile and i m not interested .","305413":"neither . when i argue with someone although that s seldom , i try to talk through the situation as much as possible to come to a mutual understanding or agreement so that the situation can be resolved . i don t really need time to cool off , but i also don t pretend nothing happened either . it s better to acknowledge the situation and do what you need to do to work through it .","305414":"fruits peaches , blueberries , bananas , raspberries , and mangoes . vegetables spinach , artichokes , eggplant , broccoli , bell peppers , and avocado .","305415":"dragonball z , thunder cats , scooby doo , rugrats , hey arnold , catdog , ren stimpy , rocket power , sailor moon , card captors , and pokemon .","305416":"i have a necklace that i wear every day because it s sentimental to me , but that s all i wear .","305417":"i would probably upload let s plays of video games , since that s the only content i really watch on youtube .","305418":"i saw somewhere online that someone younger than me didn t know who queen or freddie mercury was . that made me feel old , haha .","305419":"unfortunately , i don t see myself leaving askfm anytime soon . lmao .","305420":"i don t talk about my sex life on askfm .","305421":"i m definitely an xbox person , lol . i ve owned all of the xbox consoles except for the xbox one x .","305422":"yeah , i have jewish ancestry . my family just never practiced it , as far as i m aware .","305423":"i delete everything he sends me .","305424":"i don t really encounter any situations where i have to be brave or courageous .","305425":"i don t send questions out really anymore , but i ll usually like every answer i see to show the person that i ve seen their answer .","305426":"lmaooo . i can relate , actually . because i m busy a lot of the time , i really value the time where i don t have to do anything at all . i didn t do sh t on sunday and it was glorious .","305427":"no , the only language i know is english . the best way to learn a language is to immerse yourself in it reading , writing , and speaking .","305428":"i always viewed the bible as a fictional story , and i never really understood why people believed in god to begin with . obviously over time , i learned about other religions and how they all follow the same ideas , and people learn to have faith in their gods as a means of guidance . it never really resonated with me though .","305429":"i honestly don t remember , it was so long ago . i was a child .","305430":"i think i ve always been an athiest . i was raised catholic , but i remember from a young age that i didn t believe anything i was taught was real . i eventually told my parents i didn t want to attend religion classes anymore because i didn t believe in god .","305431":"no , i m an athiest .","305432":"hallucinogenics matt maeson https youtu . be doruhdib s","305433":"why are you yelling .","305434":"i don t think any of my pet peeves are dumb because they re ordinary things that a lot of people get annoyed with . most of my pet peeves have to do with driving things like people cutting me off , people not using blinkers , etc etc .","305435":"no , i ve never had an interest in doing such a thing . even in real life when i was single , i didn t flirt with people .","305436":"i was born and raised in new york .","305437":"lol . and acronyms especially ! !","305438":"i don t want to percent of the time . the only emojis i really use are ? and ? , lol . also , a lot of the time i m on askfm , it s on my laptop .","305439":"of course not . substance use disorder is a mental illness , and people addicted to drugs need resources to get help , not misunderstanding .","305440":"i had a great day at work i m proud of myself for running errands after work , and now that i m home for five minutes , i m so unbelievably angry . i m so tired of this nonsense and everything i do being picked apart and berated . i m too old for this shit .","305441":"to each their own . i don t personally believe in karma but i m not going to make a big deal if a friend believes in karma .","305442":"people get away with things they should be punished for , good people sometimes dont have good things happen to them , etc etc .","305443":"life in general is unfair , so naturally the society we create will be unfair as well .","305444":"it s just always something i ve wanted to learn since i was young .","305445":"no , i m not self centered at all . sometimes i can be a bit selfish , but that s relatively normal .","305446":"probably russian or italian .","305447":"i have a boyfriend , lol .","305448":"no , i never have .","305449":"i probably won t know about that until five years from now , haha .","305450":"this is an incredibly vague question .","305451":"depends on the person . i don t know what people as a whole are like because i don t know a lot of people .","305452":"it isn t something i ve thought deeply about , so i personally don t know .","305453":"yeah , at that point my life is at risk and i would do what i needed to do to protect myself .","305454":"everyone has an ego . however , if you mean an inflated sense of self , then sometimes it isn t okay depending on how that person treats others . most people with an inflated ego treat other people as inferior to them .","305455":"beer . fat tire , specifically .","305456":"the only things that scare me are jump scares in movies or video games .","305457":"nah , i never liked south park .","305458":"i haven t watched any kind of cartoon or anime in a while . i used to really like bob s burgers and king of the hill , though .","305459":"it definitely feels like it . doesn t help that i m laying down listening to sad music that makes me think . it s comforting and cathartic in a weird way , though .","305460":"for the most part , yeah . i ve only met a few cats who were really mean .","305461":"i haven t worked out in like three months . i lost motivation and lost control of myself in the process . i m trying to regain control , though . i want to start walking on the treadmill again , something is better than nothing .","305462":"i honestly have no idea why i m sad . nothing happened , my brain just decided to turn on the sadness button for the night , i guess .","305463":"it put a smile on my face momentarily , sure . however , i m actually kinda sad right now . someone should send me questions to distract me .","305464":"according to various baby websites , leigh means meadow .","305465":"i like their veggie power bowls .","305466":"no , i ve never heard of them before .","305467":"it s basically the smell of a fresh xmas tree .","305468":"depends on my mood . i drink beer , liquor , and wine . it always changes and i don t have a regular drink order .","305469":"fresh balsam and cinnamon .","305470":"i don t accept drinks from strangers , so i wouldn t drink anything .","305471":"yes , i enjoy sushi very much .","305472":"i have a fish , lol .","305473":"no , i ve only ever gone to plays and musicals .","305474":"no .

different forms of intelligence , and most of them aren t related to being book smart .","305481":"they re usually totally random or have designs that are particularly aesthetically pleasing to me . there s really no trend among them .","305482":"pretty sure it s short for before christ , but nowadays people usually use bce which i m pretty certain means before common era .","305483":"i compulsively collect cups and mugs , lol . i have an obsession with them and have no self control when i find a cute one that i like .","305484":"there s still a lot of social stigma attached to mental illness , where people struggling with various illnesses are told that its a personality flaw or a weakness of character . it blinds people and makes them not want to admit there s a problem in order to seek help . thankfully , a lot of progress has been made in regards to erasing that stigma but there s still a lot of work to be done , especially with mental illnesses that aren t depression or anxiety .","305485":"yes , they re mental illnesses and are listed in the dsm .","305486":"i used to in the past , but i haven t done it since i was a teenager assuming you re talking about the whole stabbing your hand with a knife game .","305487":"for some people , it might be . i ve always been happy with android phones , though , so i have no intention to switch over .","305488":"i ve never owned an iphone before , but apparently the camera on the new iphone is amazing .","305489":"it was sorta a joke , but i do have a history of svicidal ideation so sometimes i do wish i was dead .","305490":"i would be delighted .","305491":"omg , it was so good . i m still in awe over the entire performance . i was so emotional the entire time and was captivated the entire time . also ,

, especially in terms of meeting new people , starting conversations , etc etc . they technically fall under the same category of anxiety disorders in the dsm , but the difference is what the trigger for the anxiety is .","305499":"i just took a nap for like three hours and now i m dead . i m hoping more coffee wakes me up , lmaoo . someone ask me some questions","305500":"it isn t wrong it s pretty normal and expected . however , holding onto grudges for a long time can hurt you eventually , so sometimes it s better to let go and allow yourself to move on .","305501":"i don t really listen to heavy metal , but i think lillehjort does ! !","305502":"ugh , i know . they re so unruly lately , but i ve been so lazy , lol .","305503":"i m almost never cranky , lol .","305504":"i don t think it s weird . they could very well not speak english as a first language .","305505":"they re both , depending on the lighting . my driver s license says green , though .","305506":"i got bored and took photos of my eye . finally , a picture where you can see its real color .","305507":"have a nice day","305508":"i totally am , lol . i feel bad for my followers who have to see this plastered all over their feed this morning .","305509":"i wasn t aware that you knew my feelings better than i know them myself . hm , go figure . thank you for that enlightening idea , anon .","305510":"i m not personally offended by it . it doesn t affect my life at all , and it s not as if sweetnothings would purposely go out of her way to misgender people or be a general threat to trans people . y all are reading into all of this too much . just drop it , it s not going to change anything .","305511":"oh , lol . i thought it was about me because i explicitly was discussing how i acknowledge that i m female , but i also acknowledge my gender . i m so done with these convos about sex gender , though . i wish people would ask me interesting questions instead of trying to discount who i am . it s not as if my gender is going to magically change .","305512":"i m not non binary for sh ts giggles , lmaoo . it s simply who i am , and that has nothing to do with my relationship either . i do have female body parts which is why i have body dysphoria , though , thank you for pointing that out .","305513":"of course not . but this is irrelevant because sweetnothings isn t racist or transphobic .","305514":"lol . don t you know that we re only supposed to surround ourselves with people who have the same exact opinions as us , and anyone else who comes into the picture , we have to be at each other s throats ? ?","305515":"the person sweetnothings was referring to in that initial answer was me , you know . at least i assume it was because it was about exactly what i was talking about last night . however , it wasn t a personal attack . it was just her saying she didn t agree .","305516":"i don t think you re understanding what i m saying at all , even though i ve repeated myself multiple times . i m not going to repeat myself , due in part to clogging up my followers feeds with the same messages over over again . i agreed with you when you used the birth example . . . because being cisgender is the default . babies have no concept of gender . that s why pronouns are used for sex in the beginning of a person s life up until they discover they re trans or non binary . in the past , trans people weren t respected and their pronouns referred solely to their sex . however , as society changes , so does language . it s accepted that pronouns refer to gender .","305517":"i did , and it doesn t affect my life at all . unless she was personally attacking me or disrespecting me my pronouns , then i don t really see the big deal . however , we have a mutual understanding that we have a difference in opinions , and while we may not agree on everything , we respect one another . cc sweetnothings","305518":"i ve never been sassy , i ve simply just corrected them . it s easy to assume i m cisgender , and i totally understand that . even if i was sassy in the past , it s normal for a person to change their attitude as they get older . you begin to focus less on the small , insignificant details because they re not a big deal anymore .","305519":"i don t really understand this message because you reiterated exactly what i said . my story didn t change because i consistently explained that pronouns used to refer to sex , and as society and language changed , it now refers to a person s gender . perhaps you re confused because of the fact that i stated that cisgender is the default . it s perfectly normal to refer to someone as the pronouns that align with their sex before they discover if they re trans or non binary . at which point , pronouns change . you re not going to continue to refer to a trans man as she her when they come out and say their pronouns are he him .","305520":"both , actually . i m not bothered with being called she her because i present as feminine sometimes and my face is naturally feminine looking , so i wouldn t expect people to automatically know my gender .","305521":"lmaoo , it was bound to happen . people love arguing with me over sex and gender . thank you , though . even though we have different opinions , i value that you put your opinions across respectfully and understand people s feelings . it s rare to see these days because often people resort to personal attacks .","305522":"you underestimate the beliefs of other people then , lol . there are so many people who try to defy logic and use it to put force their own personal agenda , that s something that has never changed . either way , that doesn t change the fact that language changes as society changes therefore , while pronouns used to refer solely to people s sex in the past , they now refer to a person s gender . being cisgender is a default up until a person comes to the discovery that they re trans or non binary , at which point their pronouns can change depending upon what they re most comfortable using .","305523":"it s based upon people s interpretations of that logic as well . most forms of logic are objective , but there are some instances where it is subjective or people skew logic to suit their own personal agenda .","305524":"? ? ? studies have everything to do with it because they re based upon years of research and study . history is constantly changing , and logic is can be subjective . it s a basic , universally accepted concept that language changes as society changes .","305525":"you re asking me to go back years , man . i can t recite the source at this point . however , they all generally agreed that pronouns were a default for sex up until a trans person came out with their gender , at which point their pronouns changed . it also delved into the history behind the distinction of sex and gender , much like what you re saying , but as society changes , so does the language we use .","305526":"quite a few , from what i remember . i researched it when i was in college , so that was quite a few years ago .","305527":"there have been dozens of studies on gender since then . while what you re saying is indeed true in the past , science has progressed since those studies were published . also , gender does change definition from culture to culture , but it still exists in most cultures .","305528":"i was referring to people in real life . i only have a few online friends whom i care about in that matter .","305529":"i agree . people seldom check books out at the library anymore , and colleges give students a plethora of online resources to do their research because it s likely more up to date and accurate anyway .","305530":"are you referring to me being non binary as a trend ? ? that s a pretty long trend then , i ve been this way for years . i ve only started being open about my gender quite recently .","305531":"everyone s gender aligns with their sex when they re first born because babies have no concept of gender . cisgender is the default in our society . there s nothing wrong with that whatsoever .","305532":"it s always been relatively easy for me to do something like that . in order for me to cut someone from my life entirely , they would have had to do something that really disrespected me to the point where being friends with them is toxic . at that point , i ve lost all connection to them .","305533":"it depends on the transgression and whether or not it was done accidentally or purposely . i can forgive accidents as long as they re not repeated multiple times , but i m less likely to forgive things done on purpose .","305534":"of course it is ? ? when i was in college , all of the resources they gave us were accessed online . clinical studies , the national institutes of health , world health organization , etc etc .","305535":"they were online sources . it isn t like i went to the library and checked out books on the subject , lol .","305536":"i told you what i ve researched already .","305537":"of course i have . doesn t really matter what your impression is , that doesn t change the fact that i ve done research and came to my own conclusions .","305538":"i have more acquaintances than friends , so perhaps friend wasn t the accurate term to use in that context , and i have a lot of former friends from whom i ve distanced not for any bad reason , that s just what happens in life . i can name perhaps five people who are a genuine , close friend of mine .","305539":"it s amusing because i m either incredibly closed off or i m an open book . it depends entirely on the vibe i get from the person upon meeting them or getting to know them over time . i used to be closed off all the time , but i ve learned that communication is essential to maintaining healthy relationships and i need to be open about my feelings in order to really progress .","305540":"that wouldn t really change things . i m only part of one facebook group , and i don t really interact with it regularly . sometimes i ll make my own posts regarding things going on in my life since it s sorta like a vent group , but i steer clear of things that can make people get heated .","305541":"i m always terrified that my friends are going to get fed up with me and leave me , and sometimes i genuinely believe they only talk to me because they feel sorry for me or something . it s totally irrational , but i can t really help it . it s something i ve been trying to work on and gain more confidence in , but it s a long journey .","305542":"as long as they don t treat me differently and respect me for my own opinions on the matter , i don t really see the problem with being friends or at least civil with someone who believes that there are only two genders . i have quite a few friends who think that , and it doesn t affect our friendship at all .","305543":"the only opportunities i would have to watch them would be at night because i don t get home from work until pm . on the weekends , i generally don t watch tv or anything because i m busy doing other stuff . if i have free time , i ll usually just have the tv on in the background , but lately i ve been listening to music .","305544":"i don t own an umbrella actually , lmaoo . getting wet by the rain is annoying , but it isn t something i like or dislike . it just exists , and it is what it is . i normally have a jacket with a hood , so it doesn t bother me .","305545":"there are some instances where kids as young as or know that they re different , but if you re asking me if i would comment on their post , then i wouldn t . like i stated earlier , people are entitled to their opinions . especially if their opinions aren t hurting anyone , they re simply opinions . i wouldn t go out of my way to argue with someone on their own page because i disagree to an extent .","305546":"i like horror movies , but i hate jumpscares . i won t watch anything with jumpscares in it , which is why i haven t watched the haunting of hill house . sometimes , they ll make me a bit paranoid if i watch them at night , but it isn t a really bad fear or anything .","305547":"i m not personally sure , and i think it s something that s still being studied extensively .","305548":"well it s only am , but my sunday is going well so far . all i ve done is drink two cups of coffee make breakfast while f cking around on my laptop , lol . on sundays , i usually run errands and do laundry . however , i m wiped out from my trip yesterday so i don t want to do anything . i also did laundry a few days ago and my errands aren t urgent , so it isn t a big deal .","305549":"they probably have their own reasons and theories respective to their experiences .","305550":"no , i ve never sought revenge on anything because i personally think that s petty . there would probably be some exceptions in extreme cases , such as if someone were to m rder a loved one , but situations where people have wronged me don t warrant anything like that .","305551":"i think it s something people come to the realization of over time , especially in terms of puberty . it isn t so much a choice as it is a discovery within oneself .","305552":"when it comes to family friends , no . i don t have a hard time saying no to them , especially in regards to something i m uncomfortable doing . work is a different matter because i always take on work that my supervisor assigns to me , and to say no would indicate that i have a poor work ethic .","305553":"i don t personally believe it s strange . your gender is based entirely in comparison to your sex , and my sex is obviously female so there s no use in me denying that fact . however , she s completely entitled to her opinion . you don t have to agree percent with someone on every single matter in order to be civil with them . also , you can at least tag her , lmaoo . sweetnothings","305554":"only during intermissions .","305555":"i believe i ve read the same studies .","305556":"i know it s early , but is anyone awake and have any questions ? ? i can t fall back asleep , even though i only slept for hours last night .","305557":"i ask myself this question every day . i truly don t know who i am as a person my personality changes depending on my mood , who i m around , etc etc . i adapt myself and adopt particular traits to appease those around me , and although i suspect i do have an inner core of personality somewhere within me , it seldom shows itself in public . i ve always had issues with self identity , and it s something i ve been trying to work on in therapy . i didn t grow up with a stable home life , and i have no memory of the first years of my life , so those formative stages have been lost to me .","305558":"at the moment , i would wish for my boyfriend to have an easier life and perhaps time for the two of us to take an extended vacation so that we can escape our troubles for a little while . he s been going through hell and back when it comes to various aspects of his life , and i feel terrible because there s really nothing i can do to help except support him . he s always gotten the short end of the stick .","305559":"somewhat , yes . there is still a sense of hypermasculinity in today s society , which prevents men from showing emotions out of fear of being ridiculed or being treated as less of a man . society has progressed far in terms of it , but nevertheless , it still does exist . in reality , crying and showing emotion has nothing to do with sex or gender it s an innate part of being human . there s nothing wrong with it at all .","305560":"i m sorry you re going through this , friend . chances are , it isn t you at all . i m assuming you re in high school , and during the teenage years , teenagers can be incredibly mean or cruel hearted , not realizing the outcome of their actions or simply not caring what their actions do to people . i highly doubt you re not a likable person . those kids are just being irrationally mean to you for no good reason . however , i do encourage you to try to continue to make friends as life can be awfully lonely without anyone by your side . eventually , some will stick around .","305561":"pronouns perhaps used to solely refer to an individual s sex , but as times have changed , language has adapted to follow suit . pronouns primarily refer to a person s gender now because it refers to how that person feels and presents themselves , and using their biological sex to refer to them in terms of pronouns despite them being trans or non binary is a bit disrespectful . i ve traversed the whole gender thing for a really long time before i felt that non binary was the best way to describe me . granted , it is just a label , but it is the easiest way for me to describe my gender because i m not a trans man or woman and i m not genderfluid .","305562":"consider me the first non binary person you ve come across then . there are plenty of people who are non binary in the lgbt community . calling it nonsense just because you don t understand it , though , is a bit close minded . seek to understand what you don t have experience with instead of looking down upon it .","305563":"it s a play , not a movie .","305564":"when you have the opportunity , i highly recommend it . i was captivated the entire time ! ! and i would definitely go see it again if i had the chance . apparently it also won tony awards , including best play , and i can totally understand why .","305565":"i m in a relationship .","305566":"it was phenomenol ! ! i was in awe the entire time , the acting was amazing and made me so emotional , and the special effects were out of this world . it genuinely felt like they were doing magic on stage . it was a long day because it s split into two parts , one at pm and the other at pm , but it was so worth it .","305567":"there s a harry potter marathon on tv , this is not a drill . i m definitely not sleeping tonight .","305568":"google translate works pretty well .","305569":"hello do you have a question ? ?","305570":"it obviously isn t necessary , no . it s a nice option to have , but it isn t like it s a requirement or anything .","305571":"not at the moment , no . i m quite content right now . i also bought an overpriced hoodie at the theater today , and its so soft and cozy . i can t wait to wear it to work on monday .","305572":"y i k e s","305573":"this sounds like something a year old would say .","305574":"i m well ! ! i m really happy rn , but also really tired . i have a slight headache so i just took some ibuprofen , so i m waiting for that to kick in before i go to bed .","305575":"today was so much fun ! ! ? ?","305576":"i have , coins at the moment .","305577":"absolutely horrible , lol . i tried it once when i was in upstate new york , and i couldn t hit a damn thing . then again , it was only my first time . i m sure if it was something i practiced , i would be fine .","305578":"no , i ve never been crabbing before .","305579":"i m not on birth control . i stopped taking it years ago after it made my depression worse , made me gain weight , and completely got rid of my libido .","305580":"i haven t turned netflix on in about a week , but lately i ve been watching the chilling adventures of sabrina . if you guys like thriller drama shows , then it s worth checking out . it s incredibly good and i love the characters .","305581":"right now , my boyfriend sleeping next to me in a cozy , warm bed . i m absolutely exhausted , but i miss him and i want to tell him all about my day .","305582":"i generally don t like people touching me , so the only person i ll cuddle with is my boyfriend .","305583":"i had dinner like six hours ago , but my friend and i went to applebee s during the intermission between the two parts of the play , and i ordered a chicken fajita wrap .","305584":"i watch television , but i don t use cable .","305585":"i just got home from my trip into the city , and omg , harry potter the cursed child was so freaking good . the acting was amazing and emotional , and the special effects were jaw dropping . there were books opening and closing on their own , things levitating , people flying , dementers flying around the entire theater up into the balcony , etc etc . i m so blown away , it was amazing .","305586":"hello do you have a question ? ?","305587":"i m heading into manhattan to see harry potter and the cursed child with an old coworker ! !","305588":"i saw kesha and macklemore during the summer .","305589":"it s my actual hair color ! ! i m happy with the way it faded .","305590":"going into manhattan today i like how my makeup turned out","305591":"it s important because many people neglect to see the difference between sex and gender , and i m here to educate them on that difference . guaranteed some people probably still think of me as a woman even though i m quite open about being non binary , but what it comes down to is what they say when talking to me and or about me . if someone misgenders me in conversation purposely , then that isn t respectful anymore .","305592":"there s a distinct difference between sex and gender . i m not denying that i m female , because that s my sex . however , my gender doesn t align with my sex which is why my pronouns are they them it s what i m most comfortable with . there are also people whose gender don t align with their sex and they have other pronouns , some non binary people use he him and she her . it doesn t make their gender any less real , it s simply what they re most comfortable using .","305593":"pronouns refer to someone s gender , not their sex . if someone says their pronouns are they them , then refer to them as they them . obviously you don t respect my gender because you just called me a woman , even though i clearly told you my gender multiple times .","305594":"you re confusing sex and gender . my sex is female , but my gender is non binary not man or woman . my pronouns are they them , not she her . now that that s on the table , respect would be appreciated . it takes zero effort to respect someone s gender .","305595":"this is correct .","305596":"obviously not non binary is a gender , not a sex .","305597":"it s easier this time of year , so i wear mostly tee shirts and hoodies . sometimes i wear a binder .","305598":"i don t have people over my house .","305599":"because i don t like presenting as feminine most of the time .","305600":"my breasts , lol . they re just obnoxious and make my body dysphoria worse .","305601":"i m certain that it did , yes . it s generally understood that reading does help improve vocabulary , and considering i read a lot of books when i was a teenager , it really expanded my mind as to which words to use and when .","305602":"i haven t read in a while , but i used to read books obsessively when i was younger .","305603":"this is sorta related to this question , but the first person who came to mind is my aunt . she s a bizarre human being she keeps the ashes of her former cat in the center console of her car inside a ziploc baggie instead of an urn .","305604":"i ve always loved flynn rider from tangled , haha .","305605":"i m so tired of these fetish questions .","305606":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","305607":"my gender is non binary , and i m most comfortable with they them pronouns .","305608":"i m thinking about going to bed .","305609":"yeah , definitely . a lot of my college education was spent discussing the media and how a lot of news stations are biased , reporting only certain facts to their target audience in order to get better ratings . that s why it s important to fact check things and read up on the news from multiple sources .","305610":"i wish i had a greater understanding of myself . there s so much of my life that i don t know about , and i think that s why i have issues with self identity , because the crucial moments of my life which shaped my personality have been blocked out of my memory , which leaves me feeling confused .","305611":"neither youtube nor spotify are working on my laptop rn , and i need music to drown out the sounds of my house in order to write . welp . this fuckin sucks . y all should send me questions .","305612":"my day has been fine so far . it was an average day at work , and then i came home , made a cup of coffee , and booted up my laptop to try to write some more tonight .","305613":"it depends on the day . some nights , i fall asleep around pm while other nights it s between midnight and am . i try to get to bed earlier on the weekdays because of work , but sometimes it doesn t work out .","305614":"i pretty much do this all the time . i m always worried he s angry with me over something when rationally , he isn t so i m constantly asking if i m doing anything wrong or how i can improve myself to be a better partner and friend .","305615":"thankfully , it s been a few months since i ve felt that way . i don t recall the circumstances surrounding it , but i do remember being svicidal because everything felt too much for me to handle , i lost all motivation , i felt like i was up against a brick wall , and i had nothing to live for .","305616":"doing drugs around their child , physically verbally abvsing their child , neglecting them or refusing to give them food if the child did something wrong , etc etc .","305617":"anyone else get a nice , cozy , accomplished feeling when they switch bags and re organize their wallet and personal belongings ? ? i just did that to prepare for my city trip tomorrow , and idk i feel so organized now , lmaoo .","305618":"my boyfriend is hella gay .","305619":"waking up in the morning having coffee with my boyfriend . spending the day together , whether we go out somewhere or stay in and watch sh tty television and eat copious amounts of food . ending the night with a big bonfire in the backyard and some brews . generally just spending an entire day with my boyfriend is perfect to me . it seldom happens anymore .","305620":"i can be , although i m certainly not as curious as i used to be when i was in high school college . honestly , these days i m just too exhausted to really research into a lot of things i m interested in , which is disappointing .","305621":"i wouldn t say that i m grateful for my most recent ex , but he did teach me to not tolerate lying in any sort of relationship , whether romantic or platonic . he would lie to me constantly , i assume as a form of establishing dominance , and eventually i got tired of it and broke up with him . i simply couldn t trust him , and i later found out that he cheated on me multiple times .","305622":"i honestly can t remember . i m usually either depressed , sad , or content unaffected .","305623":"yeah , i used to be deeply ashamed of my past because i had really unhealthy coping mechanisms and it negatively affected my interpersonal relationships . i ve learned that shame is a negative emotion , though , and it only hurts you in the end . you should be able to forgive yourself and learn from those experiences to make yourself a better person .","305624":"idk , i would say probably half the time ? ? i don t generally wear makeup and my normal attire are hoodies , tee shirts , and jeans . occasionally , i ll wear more feminine clothing , though .","305625":"i don t generally do much during the summer because it s usually ridiculously hot and humid outside . being outside for five minutes usually kills me unless there s a breeze .","305626":"i love the fresh balsam candle from bath body works . i also have a candle from frostbeard studio called the shire , which is supposed to smell like clover , moss , and pipe tobacco .","305627":"the only language i can speak is english .","305628":"no , it isn t okay to purposely misgender a person , regardless of whether or not you like them .","305629":"it s literally pouring outside rn , and it s super windy and cold . i hope it isn t like this

fear of having a bad trip .","305634":"i m haunted with the infestation of alcohol .","305635":"they seriously must have livers of steel . i can t fathom it . like , my alcohol tolerance is pretty high at this point but after a shot of fireball , i m blackout .","305636":"lol , i was just talking to courrtana about fireball ! ! like i said to her , fireball is absolutely deadly . i ve only ever tried it a few times , but it really screwed me up .","305637":"honestly , i was afraid for when they first became pregnant , knowing their activities drinking and drugs and how far along they were in the pregnancy already . i hoped that they would clean up their act immediately in light of their baby . lately , i ve been disappointed and afraid in light of recent events . a child failing to thrive is extremely concerning , and the negligence on their part to rectify their behavior just has me shaking my head . i can only hope that this past week has brought light to their eyes and helped them realize that they should be doing more for their child .","305638":"i ve seen some in passing , but i haven t taken any time out to actually read them .","305639":"where did i encourage cyber bullying ? ? you clearly didn t read my post . some people do cyber bully for dramatic purposes , and that s obviously not okay . however , other people aren t cyber bullying , they re just pointing out factual things that have occurred and explaining that they re problematic . that isn t cyber bullying , that s raising awareness of an issue .","305640":"my writing is a bit sloppier , but that s what next day editing is for ! ! lmaoo . it s also a bit easier for me to think of various extended metaphors when i m drinking for some reason . tonight , i m drinking redd s wicked black cherry ! ! my gas station sells them in oz cans , and let me tell you , just one can has me feeling toasted .","305641":"depends on who you re talking about . some people start drama for no good reason use it as a means to bully other people . however , there are also some people who aren t bullying others at all and are just calling out problematic behavior where it needs to be called out , and that isn t so much drama as much as it is awareness .","305642":"keep those questions coming , i m tipsy af and ready to answer your questions ! !","305643":"my memory is so bad , i honestly can t remember if i ve done anything nice this week . i ve obviously held doors open for other people and things of that nature , but idk if i ve done anything more .","305644":"i can barely remember the questions i get each day , let alone the ones i got over the past week .","305645":"yeah , it definitely is i haven t been able to write anything all night because askfm has been keeping me occupied with how active it is , lol . but in general , i think it still is very active . it depends entirely on who you follow , though .","305646":"aaahh , this is such a cute question ! ! courrtana has the most heart .

potter books to the movies , since i grew up on the books and didn t see the movies until a little bit later . j . k . rowling was actually one of the first inspirations for me to become a writer . her writing captivated me and i wanted to do the same for my future readers .","305655":"i used to play sonic when i was much younger as a child , but i have no clue which games those were . it was back in the s .","305656":"it could be athete s foot , but obviously i m just taking a wild guess . if it s concerning , then see a doctor .","305657":"we ve actually never had this conversation before . i don t have an interest in being with anyone else , so it isn t something that has been brought up in conversation .","305658":"tomorrow i m just working as usual . i don t have plans tomorrow night or anything , i m probably going to just hang out write or play video games . weekend i have tickets to see harry potter and the cursed child with an old coworker of mine on saturday , so we re going into manhattan and spending the afternoon there ! !","305659":"lol i m so glad someone caught it .","305660":"it depends on my mood that day tbh . some days i have more tolerance than others .","305661":"in a heartbeat . i value my alone time , and i don t get it very often because i still live with my parents . the rare times i am alone , get the house to myself , etc etc . , are beautiful moments .","305662":"lol . sure , but he probably wouldn t want to spend the day with you .","305663":"personally speaking , it would depend on the transgression . but knowing who i am , i would likely just ignore them . once i cut someone out of my life , i have no feeling toward them whatsoever .","305664":"aw , thank you ! ! that means the world to me","305665":"i would feel alarmed because that would obviously mean that he has a crush on her . mentioning multiple times that someone is attractive indicates deeper feelings than a simple physical attraction to someone . if he told me , hey i met this woman today she was really hot one time , then i would probably be like , and you didn t sneak a photo ? it s not a big deal .","305666":"like , my boyfriend is attractive resembles hugh jackman , but they re obviously not twins . lmaoo .","305667":". . . but they re not the same person . either way , you can find someone attractive not have a crush on them , and ideally that shouldn t affect your relationship at all .","305668":"i have accounts on medium wattpad ! ! https www . wattpad . com user poetalunam https medium . com poetalunam","305669":"lol . oh my god . it s not as if there s any possible way for you to somehow run off with your celebrity crush , lmaoooo .","305670":"i ve never had a crush on someone in my real life who wasn t my boyfriend , so idk . i m sure he would feel threatened if that happened , though .","305671":"generally , i write poetry short stories related to my own life and feelings . however , i m trying to branch out and write a fictional novel this month ! !","305672":"lmao , no . why would you get jealous over a celebrity crush ? ? that s silly . he talks to me all the time about his crush on russell crowe , so it would be hypocritical if he was bothered by them .","305673":"no , that isn t anything close to an apology that s likely just them missing the friendship while refusing to acknowledge that they did something wrong to tarnish the friendship . especially if they re talking as if nothing ever happened .","305674":"hello i m doing quite well , thank you for asking . i just finished up two cups of coffee a load of laundry , and now i m cracking open a drink and relaxing until i get sleepy .","305675":"it s a three way tie between jason momoa , hugh jackman , and jensen ackles .","305676":"usually my grudges are due to a person not acknowledging that they did something wrong , or in some cases , it s due to me thinking irrationally about a situation and holding a grudge over something someone did that realistically isn t a big deal , but it was to me at the time .","305677":"the women i surround myself with are pretty damn flawless . they re beautiful , strong , ethereal beings have so much to be proud of ! ! here s two of them courrtana obsydia","305678":"it isn t normal for you to feel like you can t stand your partner , no . it is normal to want to be left alone sometimes , because that certainly happens between me and my boyfriend , but if they re making you so angry that this happens often , then perhaps you two simply aren t as compatible as you think you are .","305679":"i didn t realize this was a competition .","305680":"if you ve never done that before in your life , then you re a liar , lmaoo . it also doesn t necessarily mean something bad we usually point out positive attributes , and there s nothing wrong with that .","305681":"i have a tendency to hold a grudge , but it s something i ve been trying to work on for the past year or so . i don t generally get into arguments with people , so the second question doesn t really apply to me . the only person i ll bicker with is my boyfriend , but i ve never brought up old arguments in those conversations because i understand that those fights are done and settled .","305682":"when you sent this to me , i was actually looking up train schedules to see which train i should take to get to penn station saturday morning . but in a general sense , i m currently writing part of my nanowrimo novel .","305683":"we have similar tastes , yeah ! ! sometimes when we re out , we people watch and comment on other people s looks and general attractiveness .","305684":"beauty standards for women initially existed because everything was done to please men a woman was not worth anything if she wasn t valuable to a man , so the concept of beauty was encouraged in an effort to make women more desirable to men . these days , beauty standards ideally shouldn t exist anymore because we ve progressed past that point of misogyny , but unfortunately there s still a large social stigma regarding what s beautiful or normal .","305685":"i honestly can t fathom why someone would think that a person isn t a real mother if they had a cesarean section . they still carried a child for nine months , and it shouldn t matter whether or not the birth was had v ginally because a child was still developing inside of them . also , c sections are generally massive surgeries from my understanding ! !","305686":"lol . well , we did hear rumors when we were in high school about us being together . and at that point , we had to confirm that the rumors were true because my best friend and i did actually date at one point .","305687":"i think you can support the lives of most police officers while also supporting the lives of black people the two concepts aren t mutually exclusive . i m a strong proponent of blacklivesmatter , but i also know a lot of people who are in law enforcement who actually advocate for equal rights , especially when it comes to police brutality . they back the blue but also recognize that there are issues with the justice system overall .","305688":"i don t have a favorite place in my home that isn t my bedroom , haha . my bedroom is the only place i feel comfortable in my house , and it has everything i need to remain entertained . . . besides a coffee machine .","305689":"my county didn t have stickers either for the same reason although , they haven t had stickers for years , from what i can remember going back to . i never earned a sticker from voting . stickers were actually implemented to encourage people to vote , so it makes sense as to why people would be upset if they didn t get an i voted sticker upon casting their ballot . i was disappointed , honestly .","305690":"i think trump is a sad excuse of a human being with no sense of hardship , and instead of using his privilege to speak out against the injustices happening within the united states , he perpetrates those injustices . he doesn t seem to know what he s talking about half the time , and when he talks to the press , he s incredibly rude among other things .","305691":"rules that have been made to oppress and marginalize individuals .","305692":"i believe my passion is my best trait . when it comes to my interests , i either am disinterested or i m passionate about something to the point of obsession . and when i m passionate about something , whether it s an idea or a hobby or a person , i dedicate myself percent to it .","305693":"uh . . . this is a pretty inappropriate question to ask this side of askfm , especially considering i assume most of the people you sent this to struggle with some form of mental illness .","305694":"don t settle whether it s with your life , your relationships , your goals , your passions , etc etc . do not settle for just mediocre , do not settle because you re comfortable , and do not settle because no one is telling you otherwise . push . push yourself harder until you achieve things which you previously thought weren t capable of being reached . most people have a lot more capability in them than they believe , but we never reach that potential unless we re pushed , whether it s by ourselves or by others .","305695":"i think of cold nights in the darkness , where the smoke from your breath and cigarettes are the only things visible . i think of the scents of musk , engine oil , menthol cigarettes and scotch . your aura is black with purple tinge , pulsating lightly around you . you are leather jackets , slim fit jeans with tears in them not due to fashion but due to how hard you work in them , and a gaze as cold as ice . you are the morning sunrise when the sky bleeds pastel purple hues , and you are the laughter which erupts from your belly while we re sitting on the beach with a cup to share .","305696":"people are always looking for acceptance and validation , particularly if they grew up not having either of those things . by stating an opinion that isn t popular with others , you re at risk of being outcasted by the group with which you re affiliated . this is seen especially on social media , i . e . askfm , where people tend to flock together with like minded individuals . i d like to think the overall site is better now that everyone has matured , but years ago , if you voiced an opinion that was outside of what the group believed , then you would get harassed .","305697":"stephen king , anne rice , francesca lia block , franz kafka , and edgar allen poe .","305698":"i completed an internship my senior year , but it was more geared toward marketing than anything else . i didn t really have a portfolio , just my resume with one or two writing samples attached to it . internships are wonderful if you need experience , and you can put virtually anything in a portfolio , as long as it s work appropriate ! ! whether they re essays you ve written for school or creative work you ve done on your own . i had to submit writing samples to my current job when i applied , so i gave them an article i wrote for my college s newspaper as well as a short fictional piece .","305699":"i m not in school , but i was quiet and kept to myself .","305700":"i don t wear perfume , but my best friend has this one rose quartz body spray that smells amazing . it smells like roses , lilies , and patchouli .","305701":"i prefer reading paper books . the light from e readers hurts my eyes .","305702":"i only have one wig , and i bought it from amazon .","305703":"hello do you have a question ? ?","305704":"the picture i sent her was me wearing my wig , so yeah , it was accurate .","305705":"i did ! ! shehitsback is super talented .","305706":"lmao , what the fuck . i m not responding to any more of your inquiries after this .","305707":"trump doesn t treat them as equals at all . but this thread is from three days ago , i don t really have an interest in continuing this conversation .","305708":"yeah it basically means the same thing .","305709":"i suppose what i have now is the wildest it s ever been half shaved on one side , long on the other , with multiple colors in my hair .","305710":"during the summer , i sleep with the ac and fan on , window closed too much humidity , with a light blanket and no noise or light . even during the winter , i like having a fan on , lol .","305711":"it s very informal , but you used it correctly ! !","305712":"i m taken , and looks matter somewhat but they re not a deciding factor . i base my preferences mainly off of personality , i won t date someone who s attractive but with a sh t personality .","305713":"i m all right , but a little sad . i m seeing my best friend tonight for the last time before she moves idk when i ll be able to see her next . i m basically laying in bed waiting for her to text me tell me when i can come over , haha .","305714":"i do , but i don t want to post it on askfm because i don t like full body photos of myself .","305715":"i d love to be able to bake rainbow cookies ! ! they re my favorite cookie pastry , and it would be a lot better than simply buying them from the bakery .","305716":"my boyfriend understands me the most . we spend a lot of time together , and we ve been together for eight years , so he s obviously gotten to know me intimately since then . sometimes he knows me better than i know myself , which can be good sometimes because he can give me reality checks when i m not doing as well as i think i am .","305717":"it depends on how confident i m feeling that day , haha . sometimes i smile , other times i don t . my jaw is also messed up , so it doesn t naturally close all the way , so most of the time my teeth are showing somewhat .","305718":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","305719":"my mother remarried and had me with a different father .","305720":"unfortunately , i get the same way too if someone doesn t respond to me , then i assume i did something wrong or that they re angry with me , and i even look into the tone behind the texts to where i always think there s some sort of negative undertone and i m just annoying them . sometimes i realize my irrationality , sometimes i don t . it s gotten a lot better over the years , but it still somewhat exists .","305721":"no , not at all . i ll be the first person to criticize the united states and white people in general , haha .","305722":"idk what a love style is , but my childhood and how i was raised have negatively affected the way i approach interpersonal relationships . i m constantly questioning people s intentions , and i m always terrified that my friends boyfriend are mad at me or are going to leave me .","305723":"it keeps me awake functioning , lol .","305724":"yesterday actually , haha . my coworker and i were talking about politics , and she basically said that police brutality wouldn t exist if people just listened to police i didn t feel like getting into a debate , but there are a lot of biased officers who take advantage of their authority and use it to exert unnecessary control over situations . plus there are a plethora of situations where people got hurt or k lled even though they did listen , and it seems to be an issue with race .","305725":"not really , haha . i don t have much practice at all .","305726":"yeah , i was a wood elf ! ! i had a cute costume and wore a wig to work .","305727":"there s years between us .","305728":"cheddar sour cream potato chips ! !","305729":"i usually have two in the morning and two in the evening .","305730":"i didn t , she was taking requests , not commissions .","305731":"lol , no definitely not date . i migrated here when formspring died out years ago .","305732":"i ve been replaying fallout lately .","305733":"two sugars and a little bit of half and half .","305734":"i work for . hours per day .","305735":"you can do so on here .","305736":"the internet has introduced me to a number of amazing friends who have changed my life , so it s influenced me in a positive manner .","305737":"no , i don t give my fb out on askfm .","305738":"i m a slytherin ! !","305739":"i have an xbox one .","305740":"pablo neruda ! !","305741":"they re the midterm elections , so the voting is for candidates for local congressional districts and senate house representatives .","305742":"the fact that you re trying to justify p dophilia is absolutely disgusting and shameful . that type of behavior should absolutely not be encouraged , those who commit those crimes should be in jail .","305743":"my polling place didn t have stickers , i m so disappointed .","305744":"obviously that should go without saying . that s absolutely disgusting .","305745":"pretty much any song by two feet ! ! i like her life https youtu . be r gdommxcwy","305746":"probably any of the gross fetish questions . although i ve been receiving less of them because i don t entertain the notions anymore . i just delete them .","305747":"obviously it s a terrible thing because it s where a lot of sxx trafficking happens . i don t know much about it , though .","305748":"considering it s already pm , there s not much i really can do , lol . i d probably grab my boyfriend and my best friend , drive down to the beach , and watch the waves while drinking and chatting until the inevitable comes .","305749":"yeah , a few times ! ! the falling outs weren t anything bad , we just grew apart because that s what happens in life , but we ended up reconnecting years later .","305750":"no , i don t have the patience or energy to associate with people i don t like .","305751":"i never tried them myself before , but i always watch markiplier s try not to laugh challenge videos .","305752":"yeah , there s a distinct difference between the two ideas . i also believe that they both exist because i ve personally felt the difference between romantic attraction versus sexual attraction .","305753":"no , my day has been pretty okay so far . nothing good , nothing bad .","305754":"i m tired today , even though i slept for nine hours last night . i attribute it to the weather , though . it s cold and rainy today , it makes me want to just sit in bed with a big hoodie on and drink tea .","305755":"i don t miss anything when i m not home .","305756":"no , i don t .","305757":"everyone is entitled to their opinion , so i don t have a strong opinion on those who don t vote or anything . however , i do think it s important to remain aware of current events because it no doubt affects everyone .","305758":"i d want to visit australia , new zealand , england , iceland , spain , and france , among others .","305759":"i have one brother and we seldom talk . there s no animosity between us or anything , i m just not close to anyone in my family .","305760":"in my eyes , they re just as terrible as those who act on their desires but that doesn t mean they shouldn t seek treatment for being a p dophile . they re all in need of intense rehabilitation and jail time for the safety of children .","305761":"cool , overcast , and raining . one of my favorite kinds of weather .","305762":"i don t interact with my neighbors at all .","305763":"my inbox is empty , y all should ask me questions until i fall asleep","305764":"next week i want to vote tomorrow write more of my nanowrimo novel . next month i want to start going back to the gym get back on a healthier eating schedule , drink less alcohol , and spend more time on myself . next year i want to lose pounds and move out of my parents house .","305765":"it depends on where i need to go , but at this point , i can usually navigate pretty well without having to use a gps . the only times i use gps anymore are when i m going somewhere for the first time and i m unsure of the area .","305766":"you have to remember that you re your own individual aside from your family , and if your family isn t serving you or helping you become the best version of yourself , then it s perfectly valid to distance yourself from your family . you re not obligated to stay with your family if they re constantly bringing you down or aren t on your side . you have to do what s best for yourself first and foremost .","305767":"lol . ? ? ?","305768":"i don t know much about other countries , but i suppose i would choose australia .","305769":"i m only sensitive to those who are meaningful to me , i . e . my friends and my boyfriend . when it comes to anyone else , i don t take things to heart because they don t know me .","305770":"yeah , i would think this is common sense .","305771":"despicable grandson https youtu . be xkxjsizoeo","305772":"my boyfriend is my voice of reason . he always gives unbiased opinions if i ask for his honest perspective on something , and he ll help me weigh the pros and cons of a situation or opportunity .","305773":"the best thing that happened today is that i got a free large iced coffee this morning . the worst thing that happened is that i had to drive home from work in the pitch black while it was raining . my anxiety hasn t been this horrible in such a long time .","305774":"my boyfriend s mother . she would probably have a lot of insight into the difficulties i ve been having lately .","305775":"yeah , i m voting after work tomorrow .","305776":"i ve seen the original purge movie , but nothing else .","305777":"no , i m still saving up money .","305778":"i m fortunate in that i can always fall asleep at night , and there s never usually a time i can t sleep , lol . i m always exhausted .","305779":"diabetes , heart disease , and cancer all run in my family .","305780":"there s definitely a lot more awareness of physical punishment now , but back in the s and s , it was the norm , unfortunately .","305781":"the lord of the rings trilogy , the crow , girl interrupted , heathers , and queen of the damned , among others .","305782":"i assume you mean the opposing sex . in that respect , i usually notice people s height and smile .","305783":"i don

started working when i was years old .","305791":"that sounds like a you problem as opposed to a me problem .","305792":"i wasn t aware that we were still in high school , where apparently voicing your opinion on something is cool . trump s ideologies are detrimental to the rights and lives of millions of people , specifically people who are black or spanish or arab , trans people , lgbt people , and women .","305793":"i certainly hope so , but i obviously can t say for certain .","305794":"no , not at all . i m the youngest out of all of my coworkers with the exception of , like , two people .","305795":"personally , i believe so . the media doesn t need to embellish when reporting the news on trump because his antics are ridiculous enough as it is .","305796":"i already spoke about this on my page today . i don t want children now , but i can t say if i ll feel the same in the future .","305797":"yeah , i m hopefully going to the polls tuesday night after work .","305798":"middle class , i suppose .","305799":"generally , yeah . that s normal as people get older , though . we live through different experiences and learn from them .","305800":"i m not energetic right now , but i m not exhausted either .","305801":"i have really unhealthy coping mechanisms , so all i m going to say is not well . however , i do trudge through bad situations because there isn t much else you can do except that , but the initial coping with the situation has always been difficult for me .","305802":"i don t really know , i don t fake my emotions often unless i m lying to my parents and telling them that i m fine when i m not actually fine . in those circumstances , then i can easily give off the impression that i m all right and nothing is wrong .","305803":"life has been both up down i m just sorta going through the motions at this point and taking challenges as they arise . i don t have any strong opinions about the new year , though . years come and go and i ve never really been one to try to start anew come january first . if i want to make a change , then i don t need a date as an excuse .","305804":"i was heavily under the influence both friday night last night , and i can t remember the last time i allowed myself to get that sh tty . i was being safe , of course , but i haven t been that fcked up in at least a year

she s back and you have no idea how happy that makes me . y all should give her a follow and ask her all of your interesting questions , she s one of my favorite people ever and i m so blessed to have met her on askfm . ?","305809":"i don t really consider myself to be ask famous lol , yikes . i appreciate those who do look up to me , though . i personally don t see the reason why , but if i can help inspire a person to better themselves , then that makes me happy .","305810":"no , my family has never had a maid before . my father and i split up the responsibilities when it comes to household chores .","305811":"the image i portray of myself online is far from perfect , haha . i always talk about the messier side of myself , the downfalls of having mental illness , my insecurities , etc etc . most of the time , however , it s to raise awareness of mental health and to show that a person can look like they have their sh t together but really be a mess on the inside . a lot of the darker aspects of mental illness aren t discussed , especially with respect to complex disorders , so i m an open book in that respect .","305812":"i answered this question two hours ago from the initial person who asked it .","305813":"no , coffee never affects my sleep . i drink it pretty much all day long , and i can have a cup of coffee at night without it interrupting my sleep .","305814":"today , i cleaned the bathroom , painted some cabinet doors , did a load of laundry , and cleaned organized my room a little bit . i m also going to do a water change in a few minutes , but i wanted to sit down and relax first . i usually do deep cleanses every few weeks , depending on what needs to be done or if someone is coming over .","305815":"i never look forward to mondays , lol . it s difficult for me to get back into the swing of working after being off for two days in a row .","305816":"y all should ask me some questions to break up all of the cleaning i m doing today","305817":"it goes on a case by case basis . no doubt he s going to be angry with you if you let your parents know his antics , especially considering he s an adult . if he was a minor , then i would say that the parents have a right to know what he s doing , but considering he s years old , he does have the freedom to live his life however he wants and he will deal with the consequences . however , i think you should definitely tell him your concerns and tell him that you re concerned for his safety and well being , especially if his activities may be dangerous and fatal .","305818":"i obviously don t know your friend so i don t have an answer for you .","305819":"not always sometimes they text me first .","305820":"i didn t have lunch or dinner yet . for breakfast , i had eggs cheddar cheese on a croissant .","305821":"no , we remodeled the kitchen so there are a few cabinet doors that needed to be touched up .","305822":"i just threw in a load of laundry , painted two doors , and wiped down a picture that hangs in my bathroom . now i m outside having a cigarette before i need to fold clean clothes and hang them up .","305823":"i really don t remember what the best or most interesting questions were . however , i prefer questions about my life or my opinions on specific topics , as well as questions asking me how my day or week has been .","305824":"it would be nice to not have to deal with the debilitating effects of mental illness on a daily basis , lol . i mean , i m thankful that i m mostly managed with therapy medication , but there are certain symptoms that aren t fully controlled with my treatment regimen and my illnesses come and go in waves .","305825":"i don t really have any goals that are spiritual in nature . my only goal is to attain happiness or comfort within myself .","305826":"my struggles when i was a teenager weren t exactly ordinary teenage struggles , so i honestly don t have an answer for this question .","305827":"i ve always wanted to cosplay chloe price from the video game life is strange it seems relatively easy enough , and she s a unique enough character that if you know the video game community , then you ll definitely be able to recognize her .","305828":"i don t really have a favorite , but i have a few long sleeved cardigans that i love and i ll usually pair them with an oversized tank top , leggings , and knee high boots . last night to the party , i wore a red button down tank top , a long black cardigan , a scarf , skinny jeans , and ankle boots .","305829":"my autumn and winter clothing is basically the same thing , i just wear heavier jackets in the winter . but my wardrobe is composed of skinny jeans , fleece lined legging , boots , long sleeved blouses , sweaters , cardigans , scarves , etc etc .","305830":"i m not the type of person who needs to have the last word , and if i end up do having an argument which is rare , then we usually either compromise on an agreement or simply agree to disagree .","305831":"i m not a selfish person , so no .","305832":"that was the plan , but unfortunately things didn t work out that way .","305833":"i never said i didn t want kids completely , i m just leaning more towards no right now . that doesn t mean that my mind won t change when we re in a more stable position .","305834":"i m only years old , my dude . if i decide to have a child , i m not going to bring them into a world where i wouldn t be able to financially take care of them . that would be irresponsible . it s something i would consider more seriously after i have my own apartment or house and my boyfriend and i are living independently .","305835":"he loves kids , so eventually he would like to have a child . definitely not at this point in our lives , though .","305836":"idk . i can t see myself being responsible for a child because the thought of taking care of someone so small and fragile scares me . the idea of having children is something i ve always gone back and forth on , and these days i m leaning towards no .","305837":"aw , it ll be okay ! ! confidence is key , and try to go in knowing that they hired you because they liked you and wanted you to be part of their team . having anxiety about a job is perfectly normal , especially in the first few weeks , but eventually you ll get comfortable going there ! ! good luck , bby .","305838":"i haven t done something like that in a really long time , haha . if my boyfriend and i have the day off together , then sometimes we ll go out for breakfast , but otherwise it isn t something that happens .","305839":"stay at home novelist poet or a freelance writer and editor . i basically just want to write or edit for a living out of the comfort of my home , lol .","305840":"it s legal because both people are adults , so i don t really have much of an opinion on the matter .","305841":"i personally believe that you shouldn t marry for money , but i don t care about how other people decide to live their lives in that respect . if you want to marry someone due to the financial benefits , then that s a freedom you have .","305842":"i ve learned to become one over the years , yes . perhaps it s just me getting older , but i can t stay up as late as i used to and genuinely enjoy quiet mornings .","305843":"my morning has been fine . i was contemplating canceling my doctor appointment this morning because i didn t get home until am , but i m strangely feeling fine .","305844":"i ve been awake for like minutes , but here s a selfie . i slept in my makeup , lmao .","305845":"this literally didn t happen .","305846":"thanks , friend . i m sure it s a combination of not eating well today and anxiety . but i m at my best friend s house now , so we re going to have some drinks and snacks soon .","305847":"lol , no . i m not pregnant .","305848":"i m feeling unwell rn , actually . i m incredibly dizzy and lightheaded , even though i just ate and had a lot of water . i m hoping it goes away .","305849":"this is the internet , i don t care about grammar when i m on social media . i don t get paid to utilize grammar in my spare time .","305850":"and why might that be ? ?","305851":"i m not entirely sure , people seldom approach me .","305852":"my weekend has been good so far . last night , i saw a few friends and then i stayed over my boyfriend s house . i picked up my car from the mechanic this morning , went home and wrote a little bit , and now i m laying down before i have to get ready for my best friend s party tonight .","305853":"my boyfriend s father loves me , he s told me that he considers me to be sorta like his daughter .","305854":"as far as i know , my friends parents liked me . i wasn t a bad influence when i was a teenager because i never did anything reckless , illegal , or dangerous . that only started happening after i turned , lmao .","305855":"haha , no . i didn t expect to win the costume contest i was just dressing up for fun and to be festive .","305856":"i don t recall any portions of my childhood , so i honestly don t have an answer for this question .","305857":"y all should send me questions today , i don t have to do anything for the next few hours will be hella bored","305858":"for the longest time , i used to believe that you shouldn t swim until an hour after you ve eaten food because it would somehow give you cramps and you would wind up drowning lol . i also used to believe , and still somewhat do , that shaving hair makes it grow back darker thicker .","305859":"i honestly don t know what people assume about me because i ve never concerned myself with other people s thoughts in that matter . regardless , if their assumptions are incorrect , then it wouldn t bother me because it bears no significance on my life .","305860":"i ve been obsessed with the band grandson for the past few months , and i think he would be an amazing person to tour with . he s surprisingly political and a lot of his songs have some sort of political component to them , and he would just be a hella interesting person to get to know on a personal level .","305861":"space has always been fascinating to me , although it s also scary when you think about it deeply enough . the idea that there s so much out there that s unknown to us and that our perception of space is only limited by our technology is interesting , especially when you factor in the possibility that earth isn t the only planet that can sustain life .","305862":"uh . . . is it weird if i could be all of those ? ? lol . it really all depends on my mood and who i m around , tbh . i m quiet around some people , but loud around others . i m always career driven , but i also know when to relax and have fun in moderation . i don t generally like to gossip , but i m a good person to gossip to because i won t tell anyone else about the conversation . i m also quite political , but i won t let my feelings known unless someone specifically asks for my opinion .","305863":"it s obviously okay , but it could be painful for the person who fell in love for a variety of reasons , including distance , reciprocated feelings , etc etc .","305864":"i love spinach , asparagus , and artichokes , but i dislike celery .","305865":"you care about your partner s happiness more than your own , and you re willing to sacrifice your time if it means that it will make them happier or more comfortable . you can t imagine living a life without them in it somehow .","305866":"omfg yes . i love you so much . everyone follow her right now . ?","305867":"my day has been all right . i went to work , had dinner when i got home , and then went to my friend s house for a while .","305868":"someone asked to see my id three hours ago and it was because i was buying beer .","305869":"i try to avoid using uber at all costs , but if i have to , then i will . i don t really trust most car services .","305870":"working , as per usual . i just dropped my car off at the mechanic and now my friends want to hang out , so i have no way of getting to them i m pretty sure they don t want to pick me up .","305871":"my friends have always referred to me as the wild card because my looks are deceiving . i look really naive and innocent , when really i m anything but those things .","305872":"just be upfront and honest with them tell them that you want to sit down and talk to them about something , and once you two are in a position where you won t get interrupted , you can talk about your problems and how they hurt you .","305873":"lmao . omg , that s the opposite of the truth . if you don t fart , then you have a serious gastrointestinal problem going on .","305874":"my favorite cookies are rainbow cookies ! ! i guess they re technically pastries , but they re delicious .","305875":"i went out last sunday with a few friends to celebrate my boyfriend s best friend s birthday . we ended up going to a cute restaurant in lower manhattan .","305876":"i listen to the radio nearly every day ! ! i usually switch between alt . and . the shark . they re both new york based radio stations .","305877":"no , i ve never been called with spam if that s what you mean . i ve never had to change my number either .","305878":"yes , i love going to parks ! !","305879":"oh yeah , i totally forgot about that , lmao . it wasn t so much a party as much as it was an outing with friends to a restaurant . i do occasionally go to the bar too , but i don t really count that as anything because i just go to grab a drink with a friend , it isn t anything wild .","305880":"my phone is usually on vibrate , so not often .","305881":"that doesn t mean i go to parties often , lol . it just means my best friend is having a party for her birthday , and it s also a going away party because she s moving next week .","305882":"lmao what . i seldom go to parties , my life consists of work and sleep .","305883":"i m not sure i know what this is .","305884":"of course everyone farts .","305885":"i only speak english , so i have no idea what this says .","305886":"surprised me with flowers and chocolate on my birthday he sent them to my office while i was at work , and it was the cutest thing .","305887":"i took the buzzfeed quiz , and apparently got true neutral ? ? idk if that s necessarily accurate , lol .","305888":"as my bio clearly indicates , i live in new york .","305889":"hello do you have a question ? ?","305890":"one of the best days of my life was when my boyfriend and i spent the day together in montauk a few years ago we went to the brewery for a few drinks , then we grabbed dinner , and we spent the night hanging out and playing cards in the hotel room . the next morning , we visited the beach and took photos ! ! it doesn t sound like much , but it was a relaxing weekend .","305891":"i ve always been under the understanding that fascism was a far right ideology headed by an authoritarian leader dictator which gives power to the government and strips citizens of their basic rights .","305892":"i m taking my car to the mechanic saturday morning , and then that night , i have a going away birthday party to attend . other than that , i have no weekend plans .","305893":"no , i m quite ordinary .","305894":"thank you ! ! i ve always wanted to try it but was honestly too lazy , but i m going to give it a shot this year .","305895":"i actually just signed up for nanowrimo , so i have that to look forward to ! ! if anyone doesn t know what it is , it s a month long challenge to write a novel that s , words in one month . i m hoping that having this as a goal will inspire me to write more often .","305896":"autumn is my favorite season .","305897":"yes , i m feeling much better thank you for asking ! !","305898":"i don t throw tantrums . what are you talking about ? ?","305899":"it doesn t really bother me what people call me .","305900":"ahh , good luck ! ! i m sure you ll get the job , you re an incredibly hard worker . that sucks about your last job but at least you knew better than to stay at a place that isn t treating you right .","305901":"i m at work rn , so not much . i had a good night last night since i was able to see my boyfriend , but we didn t get to spend much time together since we both had to go to bed early for work . i m debating on buying another iced coffee because i ve been yawning at my desk , rofl .","305902":"yeah , i m sure they do . life and death are natural cycles .","305903":"slow zombies in the day , fast zombies at night . it seems the most fitting and the scariest .","305904":"you can easily google this question .","305905":"thank you ! ! i ve done purple like this before , just on obviously much shorter hair lol . i m all right , though . things have been hectic lately and i ve been exhausted every day , so i m hoping things lighten up soon . how are you ? ?","305906":"i m not comfortable with my body .","305907":"me in my halloween costume yesterday ! ! i have a full body photo but i don t really want to post it .","305908":"oh hell no , lol . my family doesn t know much about my life and i m not in a comfortable position to let them know the things i ve gone through . also , my family is a large source of the stress i encounter on a regular basis and the reason for my trauma , so that probably wouldn t go over well .","305909":"this pretty much defines me throughout the entirety of high school .","305910":"i m not confident most of the time , and that has no correlation with my social anxiety . i have panic attacks when i m confronted with a social issue or if i have to talk to large groups of people . it also isn t a matter of claiming , i ve literally been diagnosed with generalized and social anxiety .","305911":"no , but last night my boyfriend and i watched achievement hunter play a scary game on vr , which was hilarious because the guy they had playing it is scared of everything , so he was jumping around and screaming the entire time .","305912":"oh , lol . sorry , i totally misunderstood your message . no , i wouldn t want to spend such a large sum of money on a library . perhaps if i m extremely wealthy i would , but definitely not now .","305913":"hello do you have a question ? ?","305914":"i don t really have a style or inspiration from which i derive a style , haha . i just wear what looks comfortable to me .","305915":"i don t think there s a universal meaning to life , because you create meaning out of your own life and everyone s meaning will be different . that being said , that probably goes for animals as well . animals live off of instinct and don t have the same intelligence levels as humans , even though some animals are innately more intelligent than others . i don t think they know the concept of life beyond what they re currently living in that present moment .","305916":"if i was single , i would definitely date chloe price from life is strange , lol . i ve always been infatuated with her character and lively spirit , and i ve also been able to relate to her a lot . my second option would probably be lestat from anne rice s vampire chronicles .","305917":"i think that a lot of people believe that reading comic books is somehow immature , because they associate comics with kid related activities . in reality , that couldn t be further from the truth . there are several adult centered comics that are inappropriate for children , and i find comics to be an art form .","305918":"the weirdest fetish related questions are ones that revolve around inflation what would you do if your body inflated like a balloon ? , being a giant , having hair on your arms , and of course the traditional , invasive foot fetish questions .","305919":"society and the media cater to men s needs and disregard the needs of women on a regular basis .","305920":"yes , i have seven tattoos ! ! i love them all equally , but my favorite one is my linkin park tattoo . it has a lot of meaning to me because linkin park has helped me through a lot of difficulties throughout my life , and i wanted to also commemorate chester bennington .","305921":"i d learn how to sing overnight , lol . i ve always wanted to have a good singing voice .","305922":"the patriarchy is still alive and well . you can t restore something that hasn t dwindled in the first place .","305923":"my day was a lot of fun , actually ! ! i dressed up for halloween and went to work , and a lot of my coworkers had really amazing costumes on . we had a costume contest during lunch and took a bunch of group photos . i just got home a little while ago , and right now i m just relaxing with a cup of coffee before i heat up some dinner .","305924":"who would even want to create a library made entirely of money ? ? that sounds counter productive .","305925":"i prefer the ideologies behind vampires and the different interpretations of them , especially when it comes to anne rice s vampire chronicles ! ! lestat is my favorite vampire ever .","305926":"i ve only been home for minutes , and no one has come to the door yet . i m sure they all came earlier while i was still at work .","305927":"this is going to make me sound like a grouch , but i hate when kids come to my house when they go trick or treating , lol . i know it s a fun holiday , but i m so awkward around children that i have no idea how to act . i m much more comfortable leaving a bowl of candy out on the porch , lmao .","305928":"i ve used a ouija board quite a few times , but the only time something happened was when i saw an apparition as described in one of my previous answers . i genuinely do think ouija boards are some doorway to the paranormal , so i don t use them anymore .","305929":"my favorite candy is reese s peanut butter cups . my least favorite candy is skittles .","305930":"i m not superstitious at all , but i ve always found the superstition behind the number to be incredibly interesting .","305931":"i used black , white , and grey makeup to make my face look like a skull one year , and it turned out really good ! ! i was going to do it this year for work , but i really didn t want to get up super early in the morning to do my makeup before work .","305932":"this is halloween marilyn manson https www . youtube . com watch ? v ju ip wlsu","305933":"i ve had quite a few paranormal experiences . the most significant one , however , happened when i was a teenager and playing with a ouija board with one of my friends . when we asked the board a question , we both looked into the hallway and saw an apparition wisp from one doorway to the next . we both looked at each other and knew we saw the same thing . i haven t touched a ouija board since , it was terrifying .","305934":"black cats ! ! i think they re adorable , and it s such a shame that people actually go out of their way to purchase a black cat just for the sake of hurting it for halloween . it s one of the worst things i ve ever heard .","305935":"happy halloween ! ! ?","305936":"? happy halloween . ?","305937":"it was sold as a huntress costume but i bought it because it looks like a wood elf costume ! !","305938":"i already answered this question i said that some , if not most , babies are ugly to me . some kids can be cute , though .","305939":"no , i bought the wig for my halloween costume . my hair is basically shoulder length on the right side and shaved on the left side .","305940":"depends on if you even have a culture or not . some people define themselves strongly by their culture while other people don t adhere to a specific culture .","305941":"yeah , i have a few coworkers who have a great sense of fashion and i enjoy their outfits a lot .","305942":"depends on the individual , obviously . i m not answering this question in a personal context , though .","305943":"lack of personal hygiene . it s disgusting when someone , regardless of their gender , smells bad , doesn t wash their hair , etc etc .","305944":"thank you ! ! i m just going to work . however , my job is having a costume contest so i m dressing up and wearing the wig to work .","305945":"i have no idea what you re trying to ask .","305946":"i m five feet tall .","305947":"hello do you have a question ? ?","305948":"no , i don t give any merit as to what other people want me to look like . if that was the case , then i wouldn t look or dress the way i currently do .","305949":"things we don t want to admit to ourselves , mistakes we ve made , etc etc .","305950":"somewhat . it s important for me because i want to be comfortable with who i am , not so much what other people think of my appearance .","305951":"no , i try to be as real as possible , otherwise it s detrimental to your life and your loved ones lives . if you re living in a fantasy then you re not facing the harsh truths of reality .","305952":"i d rather not discuss things of this nature on askfm .","305953":"like visual artists or musicians ? ? either way , i don t believe i know of any .","305954":"i took this on saturday it s also my profile pic","305955":"i think you re pretty accurate , at least in my opinion , lol . it s difficult to tell what our own voices sound like . but i ve noticed that sometimes i read certain people s answers in different voices like how i think they would sound .","305956":"thanks , my dude","305957":"no , i ve never been to the south before , lol .","305958":"i honestly don t remember , it was too long ago . i just remember disliking it .","305959":"i read the scarlet letter when i was in high school i hated it .","305960":"i ve always wondered what i sound like to people who follow me online haven t ever met me . like , when y all read my posts , what kind of voice is it in ? ? it s so intriguing to me .","305961":"idk if this counts as a scary movie , but i looooved the resident evil and silent hill movies .","305962":"i wouldn t have posted it if i didn t see it .","305963":"someone giving a dude road head while on the highway , lmaoooo .","305964":"i just got home from work , so i m going to clean a little bit before i have to go back out to therapy later .","305965":"people have told me that i m trustworthy , yes . if you tell me something in confidence , then i m not uttering a word to anyone else .","305966":"they re insecure with themselves and the only way they believe that they can feel better about themselves is by putting other people down .","305967":"there are some artists he likes that i don t like very much , and vice versa , but we do love quite a few of the same musicians ! !","305968":"loyalty and respect .","305969":"no , not at all . fear in a relationship is unhealthy to an extreme , and it s potentially abvsive .","305970":"i usually find them on the radio or on spotify .","305971":"i don t take multivitamins , but i do think they can be useful if you re not getting enough nutrients through your regular food .","305972":"no ? ? that s illogical .","305973":"i definitely don t think that earth is the only planet in the universe that s habitable , so there has to be some other forms of life somewhere . if they re intelligent and somehow meet us , they d probably be disappointed . lmao .","305974":"definitely not me , haha . i hate thanksgiving .","305975":"tell them that you can t change how you look so they re going to have to deal with looking at

now . and a cup of tea when i go back inside for work .","305978":"i started watching the chilling adventures of sabrina , which has been pretty good so far ! ! before that , i finished up wentworth and killer women .","305979":"subway ! ! i always get their blt sandwich on herb cheese bread with avocados .","305980":"it took me about two years in between my first driving lesson and me getting my license . even still , i m not comfortable behind the wheel and try to drive as little as possible .","305981":"i have coins right now . as for what they ll be used for , who knows for sure . askfm

television before .","305985":"i usually play destiny , fallout , skyrim , assassin s creed , and bioshock .","305986":"yeah , xbox is the only console i use .","305987":"i can t sleep because there s too much on my mind . does anyone have any questions to distract me ? ?","305988":"family movie the nightmare before christmas . it always puts me in a good mood around this holiday . adult movie basically any psychological thriller gory spooky movie , especially if it revolves around halloween . i like the crow a lot .","305989":"i like halloween the most , but i don t really do anything to celebrate .","305990":"yeah , i know a few people like that .","305991":"my only halloween plan is to go to work .","305992":"it s probably split evenly , someone s sex doesn t really determine their infidelity .","305993":"trees especially birch , big oaks , and willow trees . they ve always had such a mysterious presence to them and you can feel their energy .","305994":"idk , askfm staff is being incredibly vague about it probably to hype whatever it is up since it likely won t be something important or significant , lol . probably new moods , profile customizations , colors , etc etc .","305995":"idk much about goats or horses , especially with respect to taking care of them properly , so i would definitely have to do a lot of research before adopting any . tbh i m kinda afraid of horses too , lmao . they re such powerful creatures and i m always terrified that i m going to piss one off .","305996":"i d love to own a house somewhere in a wooded area or open fields , with a lot of land for my future animals to run around in . i like rustic styled homes , so there would be a lot of wood and antique looking furnishings with a lot of area rugs and a fireplace . we would have a deck in the backyard as well as a balcony outside of the upstairs master bedroom . i also like the idea of having a separate room for gaming and entertainment , as well as a room where my boyfriend can keep his fishtanks .","305997":"i m not a homeowner yet because i don t have the financial means to own a home maaybe to rent if i find enough people . i would love to own a home in the future , though ! !","305998":"now you re getting it .","305999":"i don t think i whine generally , so i have no idea . if i did , my boyfriend would definitely tell me , lol .","306000":"no , i m not entertaining it anymore because your comparison has no merit . getting tan isn t racist . doing blackface is racist .","306001":"lmaoo , oh my god . i m not entertaining these statements anymore because this is getting hilarious . if you don t understand why blackface is racist , then you re part of the problem .","306002":"getting a spray tan isn t the same thing as blackface . lmao , what the fuck ? ? you re reaching , my dude .","306003":"you can dress up as a black character , celebrity , etc etc . without doing blackface . there s literally zero reason to do blackface because any logical person would know that it s extremely racist .","306004":"i think pranks in general are dumb and immature . if you re pranking a random stranger on the train , where they can t even walk away to escape the prank , then you re extremely juvenile . people are just trying to get to where they need to be .","306005":"i haven t taken a course in biology in like . . . eight years . i don t remember much about it at all .","306006":"it s always meant to be racist , that s the entire reason behind why blackface exists in the first place .","306007":"the only thing i spoil myself with is coffee , tbh . i purchase coffee at least times per week , but it s really the only thing i buy for myself so that s how i justify it .","306008":"oh my god . blackface has roots in the th century and is inherently racist , as white people would do it to force certain stereotypes of black people and create caricatures out of them . it s one of the most racist things you can do .","306009":"i played fortnite once when it first came out for free on xbox , and i absolutely hated it , lol . i died within like seconds . i m not generally a big fan of big multiplayer games like that .","306010":"i don t think askfm has revealed their purpose yet .","306011":"i haven t been paying close attention to politics lately , so i honestly have no clue who that is .","306012":"i honestly don t know i only follow a few people on askfm , so my sphere of vision regarding this website is a bit limited . they just added the whole coin feature , which is weird ngl , but it does give people incentive to ask and answer questions more often , which may help the website in the long run .","306013":"the makers of red dead redemption were so detailed in their game design that they included t sticles on the male horses in the game .","306014":"no . i ve been in bed for half the day , and the other half of the day has been spent drinking tea and eating soup .","306015":"oh gosh i don t think i would be able to cope at all . interacting with the same person all the time without any down time at all or opportunities to see anyone else , i m sure that enough to really deteriorate a person s mental state .","306016":"i don t think he s picked up any habits from me the only thing i can think of is that he says meep , which is something i ve always done . as for me , i say it is what it is a lot because of him .","306017":"people have told me that i give good advice because i m straightforward and i don t sugarcoat things . i just always think it s amusing how i can seemingly help other people with their problems , but with my own issues , i m absolutely clueless .","306018":"no , not at all . when i drink , i tend to have a live in the moment persona and i don t really dwell on anything except what s happening at the present time .","306019":"it comforts me when my friends listen to me and give me feedback on my problem or how i m feeling .","306020":"yeah , but i only send snaps out to my friends . i don t post anything to my snapchat story .","306021":"holy crap , that sucks ! ! i hope you guys deal well with the upcoming winter . in new york , it basically went from being degrees fahrenheit every day to degrees fahrenheit within the span of one week . most days , it s been cloudy and windy , but we did get a few recent rain showers and a nor easter late last week .","306022":"i honestly don t remember what my opinion of him was when i first met him , lol . i remember i thought he was cute and charming , but nothing deeper than that .","306023":"tbh i think it s insensitive . yes , there will always be people who have it worse off than you , but that doesn t discount the struggles you re enduring right now . we re given what we re given , and we have to deal with those issues as they come up . saying that other people have it worse is essentially brushing off someone s problems and declaring them not worthy enough for attention .","306024":"y all should send me questions to answer to distract me from how sh tty i feel today . i ll answer anything as long as it s appropriate","306025":"i would have no idea because i ve never been in that situation before . i would send them a message or call them , expressing your condolences and asking if there s anything you can do to help .","306026":"if you have anything useful to add to this conversation or have any questions , feel free . if not , then i m going to stop replying to this thread .","306027":"especially considering i m non binary , not a girl . lmao . but the concept that people of one single gender act alike is completely false and it s damaging . don t listen to stereotypes because they re only going to hurt you or other people in the end . everyone is different .","306028":"what else did you expect ? ? i m not here to sugar coat things for other people .","306029":"i don t want to follow you . i have no interest in your page .","306030":"i ve learned not to give in to my mood swings and emotions as much as i used to last year and in previous years . life will continue regardless of whether or not you re ready or okay with it , and the best thing you can do is roll with it and take your problems head on . i m not saying it isn t going to be difficult , but i ve learned that it s counter productive to give in or give up because ultimately the only person it hurts is you .","306031":"it ultimately depends on what this favor is .","306032":"i generally agree with this , yes . people will try to make you feel inferior , but it s ultimately up to you as to how you ll react to those statements or actions . you can either let it eat you alive or you can continue living your life in spite of them . i think it also applies to anons here as well , because people here have a nasty habit of trying to ridicule others on anon , and you don t have to give in to their thoughts .","306033":"it depends on the circumstance . if they dislike you and she s taking their thoughts into consideration , then chances are you two don t have a chance . however , if she doesn t care about what her friends think and is into you , then she may reach out . this is all assuming that she likes you , though .","306034":"sometimes , it does . it used to affect my mood a lot before i started taking medication for mood swings i would get upset really easily , cry a lot , and generally feel hopeless and unmotivated .","306035":"i m going to work as usual , but i m dressing up in costume since my job is having a costume contest . it s mainly the reason why i bought the wig , lol . i m going as a huntress , which is basically another way of saying a katniss without the hunger games attached to it . it comes with a cloak and everything .","306036":"i started watching the chilling adventures of sabrina two nights ago , and i really enjoyed it even though i only got one episode in . it s based on the comics , so it s a lot darker than the old tv series and isn t a comedy , it s a drama .","306037":"usually , they ll tell you straight out .","306038":"it wasn t exactly a costume , but i transformed my face into a skull one year using makeup . it was pretty dead on and i got a lot of compliments .","306039":"no , i ve never had surgery before .","306040":"yeah , it s generally used for both depressant and anxiety . however , i also take buspar for anxiety because it s a non narcotic anti anxiety medication .","306041":"it can go either way . i ve always spelt it as tomato .","306042":"i admire babycadiex because she s extremely knowledgeable when it comes to parenting and safety , so i would probably go to her for some questions if i were to ever have a child . irl , i have a few friends who are excellent parents too .","306043":"i prefer working by myself . i don t like the idea of having to rely on other people for a project because you can t trust that they ll put percent into it .","306044":"i don t know , it could be anything . driving home , i was convinced i was going to get into an accident .","306045":"i just made an english muffin and i m going to make a cup of ginger tea soon . and no , my job let me leave early today . they re really understanding when it comes to mental health issues , thankfully .","306046":"i m not doing well at all today . i missed my meds last night , and that combined with the anxiety i was feeling yesterday and the overwhelming amount of work i walked into today , i ended up having a panic attack and vomited at work . i m not as panicky now , but i m exhausted and my stomach is upset and i can t get rid of the feeling that something terrible is going to happen . i m afraid to do anything besides lay in bed .","306047":"i don t really do any activities around this time of year besides drink and eat things that taste like pumpkin , lol . occasionally i ll go to a halloween party if my friends are having one , but that didn t happen this year .","306048":"that s where other people come in and sit that person down and explain to them that what they did or said was a mistake or how hurtful it was to others around them . oftentimes it s hard to realize your own mistakes because you re not seeing them from an outside perspective .","306049":"no , i generally worked on homework and other various assignments as soon as they were assigned to me . if i put them off , i would experience too much anxiety and it would constantly weigh on my mind .","306050":"the only one i haven t done is go to a haunted house i m terrified of things popping out to scare me , so i ve never gone before .","306051":"scents that remind me of autumn are pumpkin , firewood , apples , and the distinct scent in the air that happens when it gets cold outside .","306052":"no , i m thankful in that i have my boyfriend to talk to at the end of the day so i can discuss what happened throughout the day or vent if i need to .","306053":"it generally doesn t happen to me because i have coffee first thing every morning , so i don t have the chance to interact with people beforehand , lol . i d imagine i would be quite cranky , though . coffee motivates me to get up in the morning .","306054":"i just checked , and apparently they updated the app and started giving people coins for interesting questions and answers . i have no idea what they re used for , though .","306055":"i used to when i was younger , but i haven t been into pokemon for like years .","306056":"i ve only heard like . . . one song from them , but i don t think i like them .","306057":"no , it s degrees fahrenheit but it doesn t feel cold .","306058":"i ve only ever been to the museum of modern art , but i enjoyed it .","306059":"no , i couldn t care less about drama .","306060":"i really don t care about the drama between people in askfm . ask me questions about me . kthxbye .","306061":"this sounds like a bullshit pyramid scheme .","306062":"good ! ! i m in manhattan to celebrate my friend s birthday .","306063":"i plan to move up further in my job , move into an apartment , and adopt a dog .","306064":"a round trip ticket from the station i left at to get to penn station was . it s a hell of a lot cheaper than if we were to drive there . and it cuts the travel time in half .","306065":"ignore my wet hair","306066":"lmao . . . what does this even mean .","306067":"it s the only way i comfortably go into manhattan .","306068":"i don t have an issue i just fail to see the point of asking me these questions when i don t know who asif is .","306069":"i don t even remember who this kid is , so these questions are pretty pointless . instead of asking me about him , ask me about other things","306070":"thanks , my dude","306071":"ask me questions for me to answer while i m on the train later","306072":"askfm , lmaooo .","306073":"y all need to stop putting vague messages in my inbox . if you have something to say , just outright say it .","306074":"i would like to get a firm grip on my mental illnesses and eventually attain happiness .","306075":"well considering i m not a girl , no . nevertheless , i don t go out dancing or partying because it exacerbates my anxiety .","306076":"thanks for explaining your intentions to me ? ?","306077":"of course i love my boyfriend . if i didn t , then we wouldnt be together .","306078":"maybe i ll start it tonight considering i have nothing else to do , lol .","306079":"sounds interesting ! ! i love dark shows .","306080":"how is it ? ? i ve been debating on watching it . i would love if they rebooted as told by ginger . that was probably one of my favorite shows back in the day .","306081":"i m so fuckin bored it s a saturday so i can t go out bars are too crowded and noisy . someone entertain me with questions .","306082":"no , i m comfortable . it isn t cold out today where i live .","306083":"i m doing well now that i have some iced coffee in hand . i m playing fallout while my laundry is being washed .","306084":"i m not here to convince you . i m just telling you what i know to be true .","306085":"it isn t a matter of who , it s a matter of what . that can be explained by science .","306086":"yes . . . i just said i was a nail biter .","306087":"i m a chronic nail biter .","306088":"not really . i only trust a few select people , and that number is soon to get smaller .","306089":"i originally answered this question saying that i was tired , but now that i have a oz iced coffee , i ll be fine . time to do some laundry , i guess .","306090":"i m looking forward to going into manhattan tomorrow to celebrate my friend s birthday . i m also seeing harry potter and the cursed child in like two weeks , which should be a lot of fun ! !","306091":"it doesn t ! ! thank youuuu .","306092":"? i am the shadow on the moon at night . ?","306093":"like , my work days are spent critically thinking for almost nine hours straight . on the weekends , i m braindead , lmao .","306094":"because i don t feel like thinking critically right now . i m mentally exhausted .","306095":"that requires a level of knowledge about science that i don t have . the only science classes i ever took were biology and human anatomy . i m sorta done with these questions , though . if y all have any other questions , feel free to ask .","306096":"i used to know the basics years ago when i was more educated , but i don t remember the specifics .","306097":"the big bang theory seems to be the most logical conclusion .","306098":"i ve debated this question for essentially my entire life , and i haven t come to any concrete conclusions . i used to think that while our physical bodies perished , our energies are transferred to another medium , which can be related to reincarnation . but it isn t something i m entirely convinced of .","306099":"idk what else you re expecting from me .","306100":"that s called faith . which i already said multiple times that i don t have faith .","306101":"god is an omnipotent being with whom people have faith in an effort to bring guidance to their lives .","306102":"google exists for a reason .","306103":"no , it s something i ve pondered for years and have ultimately come to my own conclusions . i used to take religion classes when i was a child , up until i realized i didn t believe in god . since then , i ve researched other religions and have found the trend that people believe in whichever god they believe in due to their faith . i don t have faith .","306104":"i ve literally seen apparitions and have had paranormal experiences , which is why i believe in spirits . i don t believe in god because there isn t any evidence to suggest one exists . religion is also based upon faith , which i don t have .","306105":"i don t discuss things of this nature on askfm , especially considering it can be deemed a fetish .","306106":"i fail to see the correlation between the two .","306107":"if it causes an issue in your relationship , then yeah , that seems pretty significant . if you know that he isn t entirely wrong , then you ideally should try to have a more open mind . however , at the same time , it also matters how he goes about giving you lectures . if he makes you feel bad or upset then that s a talk you two need to have to be more receptive to each other s feelings .","306108":"it doesn t ever happen really because i only vent to my boyfriend and like two close friends , but i dislike when people brush off my problems and indicate other people have it worse or you re just overreacting . i m aware that other people may have it worse , but that doesn t discount what it is i m going through now or make it any better . everyone will always have problems and this is what i was given .","306109":"yes , halloween is my favorite holiday ! ! i love all of the spooky movies and decor that are sold in stores , seeing everyone in costume , and the general atmosphere of the time of year .","306110":"depends entirely on who it s from and whether the criticism is warranted or valid however , i usually take it into consideration unless it s just wildly untrue .","306111":"yeah , i d say i m fairly patient with most people . you d really have to get under my skin in order for me to lose my patience with you , which only one or two people can do .","306112":"at the moment , it s grandson ! !","306113":"when i m angry , i usually either play video games , talk to friends about my problem , or drink . i calm down my boyfriend by letting him vent about his issues , bringing him food , and suggesting that he plays a violent video game to get out his aggression .","306114":"who said that pisses me off ? ? i know i look feminine sometimes .","306115":"i m trying to grow out the one side of my hair , because i m keeping the other half shaved .","306116":"it s funny because i ve never had long hair before , but i was always curious as to how i d look .","306117":"nah , but i am going to wear it for halloween .","306118":"yeah , i live in the united states so halloween is a big holiday here .","306119":"thanks for the follow , my dude","306120":"it s a wig , actually ! ! i love it , i bought it to wear with my halloween costume .","306121":"most of the places i go to don t have self checkout .","306122":"when the person behind or in front of me tries to talk to me and goes can you believe how slow they are ? ! i can t believe this . stfu . cashiers are human beings too and they re trying their best to attend to every customer in a timely fashion . it isn t their fault if a customer has a lot of items , or a lot of coupons , or if they re sometimes dealing with a difficult or irate customer . have some patience and realize that they re doing the best they can .","306123":"that s a matter that s up for debate . i personally believe in spirits .","306124":"no , quite the contrary actually ! ! i didn t think they were real either until i had that experience and started researching more into the boards . it s generally advised to not use them because they could invite unwanted spirits into your house .","306125":"you don t even know what i look like on a regular basis , lol .","306126":"i don t love shopping as it is , so the sales make little difference to me . i just appreciate when the items i actually need are on sale .","306127":"no , i ve never been robbed in person before . once , someone broke into my car but that was the extent of it .","306128":"i prefer running my errands on the weekdays after work so that i have the weekends free to do whatever i want to do . i . e . i ran a bunch of errands last night after work , because i honestly didn t want to do them today because i knew i wanted to have a lazy saturday .","306129":"dear trump maybe actually show some compassion for once , if you have that in your heart . take the stick out of your a s and instead of blaming democrats the media for horrific events , see them for what they truly are and take steps accordingly . also , trans people have existed and will continue to exist regardless of whatever trash policies you try to enact .","306130":"i was stupidly playing with a ouija board once when i was younger , and my friend and i ended up seeing a white wisp in her upstairs hallway after we asked a question . it was terrifying , especially considering we were only like years old . i never touched a ouija board again .","306131":"spirited away , atlantis the lost empire , treasure island , and the emperor s new groove .","306132":"i spend my nights either watching netflix , playing video games , listening to music , or watching youtube videos .","306133":"sending this twice isn t going to get you an answer any faster . go to a doctor .","306134":"the last time i played the video game layers of fear , i was absolutely terrified , lol . it s not an inherently scary game like outlast or anything , but it definitely keeps you on your toes .","306135":"you can t tell that just by looking at someone , rofl .","306136":"if i did that in my neighborhood , i would get robbed immediately .","306137":"? ? ? you literally had to remind me that he tried pulling some bullsh t on my page ages ago because i didn t remember who he was , lmao . this is getting so stupid now . i m done talking about this kid .","306138":"hell no . they re too loud and busy for my liking .","306139":"lol . no , i have relations with my boyfriend .","306140":"i have zero clue as to what you re talking about .","306141":"who are you talking about ? ?","306142":"he doesn t see any issue with it at all . i hang out with his friends when he s not around pretty often .","306143":"yeah , i got that vibe too . he stopped messaging me , though .","306144":". . . what ? ? i wasn t aware we were still in high school , where you can steal friends .","306145":"that doesn t sound like it s my problem .","306146":"my fb is private and i only have certain friends added to my fb . if you need help with speaking english , then take classes . i m not a teacher .","306147":"lmao . no . i don t give my fb out to anyone .","306148":"i have no desire to connect with anyone on askfm .","306149":"i know of the country , yes . i ve never been there and i have no intention to go there .","306150":"i like traveling , but i seldom get to travel .","306151":"lol . there s not much to miss , i haven t gone anywhere .","306152":"lmao , who the fuck is soopa .","306153":"no , he s just a close friend . he s actually my boyfriend s best friend .","306154":"i actually love attending weddings ! ! i like the aspect of having fun with good food and drinks with friends , and its a celebration of love , which is always beautiful .","306155":"i m going into manhattan on sunday for a brunch celebration for my friend s birthday ! ! i m excited , i haven t seen him in a long time .","306156":"i m aware . that still has nothing to do with abolishing gender . in fact , it states the complete opposite .","306157":". . . lmao , you really need some critical reading skills . that says nothing about abolishing gender , it just states that people are their genders regardless of what their bodies look like .","306158":"lmao , i figured as much . that s why i put and don t say .","306159":"people have said that i am , but i personally don t see it .","306160":"my halloween wig caaaaaame .","306161":"i don t really care about what other people say or don t say .","306162":"my boyfriend is the strongest person i know . he s been through a lot of hardship and deals with multiple chronic illnesses , but he s never let his struggles set him back . he s incredibly hard working , and once he sets his goal , he achieves it and then some .","306163":"yeah , all the time i adopt his problems as my own most of the time and it makes me feel terrible if he s in a bad mood because usually there s nothing i can do to help the situation .","306164":"no . . . like i said , babies have no concept of gender . when they re born , it isn t wrong to assume that their gender aligns with their sex . your gender is something you figure out later in life .","306165":"yes , i do that whenever he needs to vent about something . just because i feel crappy doesn t mean he can t express his own feelings too .","306166":"i m all right . i m finally home after running errands after work , so i m looking forward to sitting down with a cup of coffee .","306167":"interesting . i fail to see how this involves me , though .","306168":"no ? ? babies have no concept of gender , lol .","306169":"yeah , it s the peak time around am that paranormal activity is most active .","306170":"i have no idea what you re talking about the last question i answered on here was the last one you sent to me .","306171":"i mean , i ve been using the internet since so nothing really surprises or phases me anymore . if someone says some nasty shit to me , then i usually just delete it .","306172":"this doesn t give me any information at all . if this person has a problem with me , then they should speak to me directly . otherwise there s no point in any of these messages .","306173":"exactly . just like i didn t expect to make friends on askfm , but lo and behold , i made one of my closest friends on this website and eventually met her thanks to askfm .","306174":"? ? ? why don t you just link his username and save us all the trouble ."}}
