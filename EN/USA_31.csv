   How were you’re high school years compared to your college years ?
  ","
  well I started off high school being bullied for being different like I had all through elementary and middle, but I quickly put a stop to that shit and came up from the bottom to the top of my school, collecting up all the ""freaks and weirdos"" as my friends and becoming alt-popular. By my senior year I was feeling like I was on top of the world. I had good friends and the respect of my peers. College was more of the same, both high school (and all of my schooling) and college were art specific so I was like queen of the artsy kids. Until schizophrenia then I sort of unraveled and had to leave school and lost a lot of the confidence I had.

  I'm in the in-between stages of growing short hair out long.

  no not really. I never know what to say and end up being cliche probably but I deeply CARE and I WANT them to feel better I just don't know the best way to verbalize that. I like to think my friends understand though.
  "
166302,"
   Nice, have you ever thought about maybe getting a parrot ? The ones that could actually talk and can be tamed as well?
  ","
  technically Bubo is a parrot, just the smallest type. Her breed CAN talk but mostly only the males learn to talk and she is female and has shown no interest in it. I've tried though! My next bird will probably be a larger species and we'll try talking again. There's a parakeet named Disco who says all sorts of things, here's his video

166303,"
   Is your bird trained?

  well, she's tame and she knows certain commands but she's also spoiled and does what she wants. Luckily what she wants is often to hang out and be cute. She's also very affectionate which is great because parakeet kisses are the sweetest.

   Is it different from Dyslexia?
  ","
  dyslexia is a learning disorder I think? I'm not really sure, something to do with mixing up signals and reading them in an incorrect order or whatever. So as far as I know, nothing alike.

  it can be managed for sure. It takes a LOT- I take 3 prescription supplements, an antipsychotic, and an antidepressant for schizophrenia (and like a billion other pills for other things) and see a psychiatrist every 3 months (and a therapist as needed) and will have to for the rest of my life.  There is no cure, and honestly there hadn't been much studying of it at all until the past decade or so. They still have a lot to learn.

   Schizophrenia is what exactly ? No offense
  ","
  it's a psychotic disorder that affects 1% of the population. Has positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms are things like delusions, hallucinations, feelings of persecution, etc and usually manifest late teens. Negative symptoms are depression, lack of motivation, socialization issues, etc and they can manifest much earlier (and definitely did in me, as early as age 7) and I don't suffer from any cognitive symptoms but they're like, memory loss, word salad, catatonia, etc.  ANYWAY it's a complicated disease but I'm considered ""Residual"" so like, treated. I don't have hallucinations or delusions any more in any big way. I still suffer from some negative symptoms because they are notoriously hard to treat but I am mostly functioning now.

   How was your college years
  ","
  This is complicated. I LOVED college, the two years I made it through, and my college loved me and still considers me an alumni despite the fact that I couldn't finish. However, my positive symptoms for schizophrenia manifested when I was 18 so that made school and life less and less doable. I ended up being pulled from school by my mother and she basically locked me away until I sorted myself out and got free, and then I was able to finally get the medical help I needed (after a suicide attempt) So while school was amazing and I had a lot of friends and the admin liked me a lot, I was literally losing my fucking mind everyday and it became impossible and I became unable to make my own decisions and sort of got majorly, royally screwed over by my mom because no one else knew what to do with me either.

It's been hard to lose weight while on so many meds but I AM losing, albeit very slowly.

   Why did you feel the need to come out as bi when you're in a monogamous heterosexual relationship and have been for years? I've seen a few women do it and I genuinely don't understand why, especially if you don't have an open relationship. Is it just to identify with the queer community?
  ","
  I grew up with an untreated BPD mother who was controlling and abusive when she wasn't straight up neglectful. One of her beliefs is that there's ""no such thing"" as bi people, you're either gay or straight. So for years I dealt with that internally- feeling like my attractions to all genders didn't really exist or was all in my head. It wasn't until I removed her from my life permanently and started intensive therapy to find myself separate from her abuse that I came out. I've always BEEN bi, I just didn't admit it until later on. And being in a monogamous relationship doesn't mean that you don't have crushes or don't have weird sex dreams about others? Your personal sexuality is yours no matter what your dating or marriage situation is. I'm mostly attracted to women. I have only dated men. It's just a weird thing, yo.

  I'm always honest about shit, and if you followed anything I ever say to anyone on this site you'd know that. You just want to fight. You feel better about yourself by nitpicking and dissecting everyone around you. It's really fucking sad. No you're probably not on his list like I am, because for a third time, I am the things he targets. Just like you target me as a mentally ill woman because you feel superior. You don't go for the 5 or 6 men I follow who also answer Ben's questions. You don't go for literally anyone else, just me. I'm a good target. I make you feel like a big person.

   It literally takes less than 5 seconds to block Ben. Even a ""mentally ill overweight disabled woman"" can do it. Five seconds.

  and what I'm saying is, because you're too stupid to understand the first time around, is that there's no point in blocking he comes back 2 hours later. Literally 2 hours or less later. I report Ben when he gets especially out of hand. I report him probably as much or more than anyone here. But when I block him, which I have, he's back immediately.
  
  He does this because I am a preferred target. Just like I am your preferred target. You're not going for Ben, you're coming for me. Someone who probably in most things is your ally. It's really gross how abusive your behavior is coming for me over and over again and all of the harassment.
  "
166536,"
   I filter Ben to the point that I block him. So do most ethical people. Its easy
  ","
  well that's really great for you. I hadnle my trolls differently. And to be honest, I have blocked Ben. Like everyone else on this entire site, I started blocking Ben when he first reared his racist head. It really honestly if you are me, a mentally ill overweight disabled woman, there is no blocking Ben. He keeps me on his regular question rotation because I'm a fun target for him. Kind of like why you're still on my shit about it. I've blocked you before too and look where we are now.
  
  I get that you're jealous. You're an anon shitbag and no one ever asks you anything. That's why you keep coming for me. Maybe if you wisen up, stop being a douche, and come off anon, people won't ignore you. But probably they still will because honestly, you're unpleasant as fuck.
  "
166537,"
   I think you said that he was young sort of as an excuse and that he might grow up but he's an adult? Like he should know better. Anyway I dont want to upset anyone. He doesnt ""literally"" have a new account every day. Its more like every month and its easy to block him not pointless ✌️
  ","
  I said at one point that I hope that anyone here under the age of 24 or so still has time to not be a shit person. That wasn't necessarily just in reference to Ben but to all of you young folk who think you're at the top of your game and in a place where you can pass judgement on others. People can change. I was a (gasp) Libertarian when I was 24 like anything's possible.
  
  And yeah, like twice a day. As someone who gets garbage from him every day, all day, I am well aware of how often he gets shut down and then reopens with some new account. Believe me- I filter out SO MUCH BEN. He has recently slowed down some but it comes in waves.

For whatever reason she loves/hates red and always attacks red toys first and then orange and now she's working on greens but that's been the pattern with every other toy similar to this with these colors and blue and purple usually last to the end so I'm pretty impressed by her color preferences. To make it more interesting she has been piling her big chunk remains of the toy in color piles, red on the farthest side of the cage away from the others. I almost don't want to clean the lining because she was so serious about sorting those pieces of wood out.

  I started smoking when I was 15. My mom gave me my first cig lol. There was no good reason to smoke but I did faithfully for 15 years. When I was 21, I noticed people were complimenting my singing rather than making fun of me so I got really excited about karaoke and did a lot of old jazz songs with my new sultry smokers voice. I quit when I was 30. It took about 3 weeks for my lungs to cough out all of the gunk, and probably a few more months of mucusy healing but my voice is back to the less pleasant but more normal singing voice so no permanent changes I'm sure there are still health risks I'm facing because of smoking but if you quit you can get healthy again with time

  ","
  oh no, art is a good topic for me for sure I love art. I'm glad you're exploring, it's important to experience as much as possible imo. I love art because it starts as a need to create,  and if all goes well then it causes others to feel something inside themselves, too. Communicating in images and feelings. My favorite historical art movement is probably the expressionist era. Between the world wars, Europe just sort of exploded with new creative and expressive styles- impressionism, german expressionism, surrealism, dada, etc.- and it brought art into a whole different direction in the West. I don't know much about non-Western art sadly because of faults in my teaching but I love the indigenous works that we have here in the PNW.

   Are you able to describe the symptoms of your schizophrenia?
  ","
  schizophrenia has three types of symptoms; positive, negative, and cognitive. I don't really have any cognitive symptoms other than some memory loss. Positive symptoms are the more psychotic symptoms like delusions and hallucinations and the like. For me I had visual and auditory delusions and got very paranoid about government entities and various omens and superstitions. I don't really deal with that much now on meds, just an occasional voice or like, a quick attachment to a weird idea that passes. Negative symptoms are the everyday gross parts of schizophrenia like depression and agoraphobia and lack of motivation and inability to socialize easily. These are harder to treat but I'm trying multiple things that seem to work together some. Recently I added light therapy which has helped a lot with depression.

  It's business as usual for a bartender, and one day as he is cleaning his bar when an unusual customer walks in. The man is dressed in an expensive suit, has a beautiful supermodel hanging off each arm, and has a limo parked outside. Furthermore, the man has an orange for a head.
  
  The customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone a drink. He pays for it from a roll of hundreds and manages to get the attention of every woman in the joint, despite having an orange for a head.
  
  The bartender is not a man to pry, but he feels compelled to ask about this man's life.
  
  ""Excuse me,"" says the bartender, ""I can't help but notice that you're obviously fabulously wealthy and irresistable to women, but you have an orange for a head. How did that happen?""
  
  So the man told his story.
  
  ""A while back, when I was penniless, I was walking along the beach and saw an old lamp, half buried in the sand. I picked it up and gave it a clean, and POOF! out popped a genie. The genie explained that he had been trapped in that lamp for two hundred years, and that he was so grateful to me for freeing him that he would give me three wishes.
  
  ""For my first wish I asked for an unlimited fortune. The genie said 'It is done!' and from then on, whenever I needed money, it was there.
  
  ""For my second wish I asked for the attention of all the most beautiful women in the world. The genie said it was done, and since then I have been able to get any woman I wanted.
  
  ""For my third wish -- and, this is the bit where I kinda fucked up -- I asked for an orange for a head.""

   Why do you need one long fingernail for knitting?

  you don't need it for sure but I use my fingers more than the needles in a weird way of self-taught left handed knitting and I end up sort of flicking the yarn loop off the needle with my thumb nail.

   I notice the anons (or perhaps it’s just one) out in force today with cruel or childish statements and attacks on people. Do you ever engage with trolls (anonymous or otherwise)? If you respond to them, what makes you do it, and has it helped?
  ","
  Some trolls, I'll interact with the tamer posts. If it's bad enough to be reported, it gets reported instead. If it's in between tame enough and bad enough to be reported, it gets deleted. The trolls that I interact with are at least asking questions and not just attacking me for some reason. Anons that come at me in an aggressive way get blocked immediately. I realize that's about worthless (I mean, like all of us, I started off just blocking Ben but he literally has a new account every day lately so there's really no point at all) but it's there as an option and some people aren't as determined as he is.
  
  So TL:DR- is their intent to attack me or is their intent to waste my time? I'll entertain a time waster who asks actual questions. I'll report what needs it and I'll block when I have to.

  they throw you in a big circular imaging tube, on a cot that moves. You have to stay incredibly still and hold your breath when they tell you to. A voice screams at you through a speaker in the tube. Sometimes they want to do a intravenous dye that makes you feel like you pissed your pants when it hits your veins. It's all very loud and uncomfortable but it's mostly a quick procedure and painless.

  no, my attendance was terrible. I was always sick as a kid. Then in highschool my family moved to another state and left me behind my senior year because I was 18. So I skipped all the time because I didn't have a family for the school to report it to and my teachers all felt sorry for me. I had already been accepted to my first pick college though so school was sort of pointless at that point.

166895,"
   When did you last get really ticked off and for what reason?
  ","
  to be honest, I am on a lot of meds and I don't feel emotions very strongly lately. So even if I've been pissed off, it's passed pretty quickly. I am mad that I'm out of coffee this morning but I'm also aware that that's a stupid reason to be mad. I'm mad that one of you keeps using my sarahah to bully me and be ridiculous and childish but at the same time I have better things to worry about. I think it's the beta blockers- I take them for panic disorder to keep my adrenaline from overproducing and since then I sort of just don't get that mad for long.

  native americans didn't oppress any other peoples. They are pushed off into reservations at a fraction of what land they had before. England has done nothing but oppress other cultures.

  I need to have better control over my willingness to participate in financial conversations with my husband. It's something I pay little attention to and I know it bothers him. I just don't react well to numbers and budgets and while I don't spend a lot, that's not the issue, I really just don't ever remember to for instance enter in a total in the online budget sheet, or save a receipt to go over totals later or any of those sort of things. I should be in more control of our finances but I'm too uninterested and bad at it.

  I'm not sure the math on percentages and all that and she's definitely met more women than men, and while I could count the men probably (under 10 for sure) I can't remember how many women so I wouldn't be able to do the math on that. Of the 10 men she's met she only let ONE pet her- and that was some teen kid who was friends of my friend's kid who helped us move. She lets the woman vet, all of the ladies at the bird store, my stepmom, and me of course pet her though so lots of women.

   In the USA and increasingly in the UK, military service people are referred to formally and informally as “heroes” by the public and media, regardless of whether or not the individual has been on active service. What are your feelings in this, if any? What’s your personal definition of “hero”?
  ","
  My grandfathers were both servicemen and two out of my five nephews served (one is still in the Army). So I have some degree of respect for what they do because they're my family and I love them. However, I think it becomes almost hero worship in some cases in America with the military. Meanwhile so many vets develop mental illnesses while serving and get pushed aside and treated like bums. So I wish if we were going to elevate the status of some military people we ought to have better mental health care for veterans
  "

   Why is it always the nice men that get treated bad by women? I use to be nice, non aggressive, non political and respectful to women but they done me dirty to many times and I thought to myself why should I show respect and kindness to women if they don’t shoe me respect and kindness in return.

  you're generalizing again and it's really yucky. The actions of a few doesn't sum up the actions of all. I married a ""nice guy"". I don't treat him bad at all. You should strive to be kind and respectful no matter who you're interacting with.

Not to mention that was going on when gamergate was happening so I just sort of lost interest in games. I still play something sometimes, I was a fan of pokemon go when it came out and I played firewatch and kentucky route zero last year but like I tried to pick up skyrim again not long ago and I was just so bored with it.

   Why didn't Bubo liked having her eyes, ears, and beak checked? Do birds find those to be sensitive parts of their bodies in general?
  ","
  The vet used a small pen light to look in her eyes which was too bright and made her react, and same with ears which meant lifting up some feathers on her head which wasn't comfortable or a normal interaction. Her beak is just annoying to have messed with because it makes her want to bite. A strange lady poking at you is a good reason to wiggle around and fuss a little. The most sensitive area of her body is her abdomen and cloaca but she did better with those exams because she was held more securely.

  that it goes into remission. That most people aren't showing psychotic features all or even most of the time, and if they're managed well with medications, hardly at all. Negative symptoms like depression and apathy and lack of motivation are where the diagnosis can be most disabling. I use a lightbox and take 3 medications for depression (Vit D, Prozac, Folic Acid) in addition to my anti psychotic meds and supplements. But, it is manageable and we are just people like everyone else. Not scary.

   How is Bubo doing? Did she end up needing help getting that last egg out? Is she okay now?

  She's doing great, her vet visit was fine she's a perfect little birb. I thought she was ""eggnant"" but she was just a little chubby from sitting and eating so much. She still might have another egg, we're not in the clear on that for another week. All of the vet assistants and people with their pets in the waiting room came to see her and told her she was a pretty girl. She loved the attention except for the part where she had to be held still and have her eyes, ears, and beak checked that was NO FUN.

I don't care for politically charged, racially charged, misogynist, transphobic content and if I get it it gets reported or deleted depending on severity unless it's a)mild enough to respond to and b) gives me an opportunity to try to correct a terrible viewpoint. I will not tolerate aggression and hatefulness towards myself or anyone else. Call out posts get deleted. Etc. I don't know I think I'm like everyone else here I like to socialize in this sort of third-person way because I am mentally ill and I don't get a lot of socialization apart from social media or at least, not often.

  I wake up early because I go to bed early, so by 8:30 normally. I come in the living room, turn the xmas tree lights on, check in with Bubo, make a cup of coffee, and start my light therapy. Light therapy lasts an hour, and I drink 2-3 cups of coffee during. Bubo wants to visit for about 30 seconds every hour right now while she's nesting still so I listen for her chirps at the door of her cage letting me know she's taking her egg break. After light therapy I take my meds, smoke up, grind weed for the rest of the day, gather up dishes, and start cleaning the kitchen. Once that's done I usually do laundry or vacuum or straighten or clean a bathroom. in between all of this I'm listening for Bubo and checking the computer for notifications. So I take a lot of breaks. That's basically my dad until Jon comes home then we make dinner or buy dinner and eat together and watch tv together and sometimes I exercise and sometimes he goes to the gym and I go to bed early usually not long after I take my night time dose of meds.

I was there with my bestie at the time, and there were like 8 other people. The girl's parents were rich and they had like, several formal gardens and a guest house. We were in the garage off the main house.
  
  ANYWAY I didn't know I was on drugs, obviously, which made it way scary. We were all cigarette or clove smokers, so the garage was filled with smoke and suddenly, the smoke felt solid to me, so I crawled out quietly while the rest of the party was distracted. I continued to crawl into her garden, which was laughing at me and trying to hurt me. I managed to get to the guest house porch, crawling, and became convinced I inhaled the solid smoke and was going to die so I made myself throw up and then fell asleep on the porch. This one girl found me like a half hour later (this whole adventure was like an hour) and my friend was alerted and he took me home.

  She likes to come out and play on top of her cage sometimes, and I used to keep a little play are up there with a swing and some perches so she could go to the top and play when she wanted but she just got bored with it and kept flying over to my shoulder to see what I was doing so I just adjusted my schedule to spend more time with her on my shoulder and stopped leaving her cage open. I have three cats so I don't feel comfortable letting the door open unless I'm watching closely. She has a huge cage though, it's meant for several birds twice her size, and lots and lots of perches and toys so she does love her cage too.
  "

Right now she doesn't want out of her cage for more than 10 min at a time because she's nesting but when she's not being a egg laying weirdo she spends about 5 hours a day out of her cage
  "
167657,"
   Does she speak like real parrots?

  female parakeets aren't big talkers. Bubo hasn't cared about mimicking me, though she does love to imitate bigger birds when she comes back from boarding at the bird store. But the type of bird is capable of talking and in fact can learn more words than any other type of parrot. There's a budgie out there who's name I can't remember but he can say 500 different phrases and whistle a bunch of tunes as well. Males are just more talkative, they sing to impress ladies and love to mimic their owners.
  "
167658,"
   Is a budgie basically a poor man’s parrot?
  ","
  of course not, my parakeet (american budgie) is a wonderful companion bird in her own right and when I lived in an apartment (when I got her) she was one of very few types of birds quiet enough to be allowed. And anyway she's still considered a parrot.

  I'm not really sure I think it varies from bird to bird. I think with Bubo I simulated Spring with my light box and it made her start nesting/chewing her toys to pieces and then fall in love with her toy bell. Two days after spending all of her time with the bell she laid an egg. She was supposed to lay again after 48 hours but never did so I guess this is a one egg clutch. I don't know if this will be a yearly thing or if this is the only time she'll ever lay or what I guess time will tell.

  I took it out initially but I was told to put it back in her cage until she stops laying and comes to terms with the fact that her babies aren't going to hatch on her own and starts ignoring the eggs. She totally didn't care that I took away this one so I doubt we'll be doing this long. I expect her to have around 4 more now. One each 2 days.

  for a while, I really wanted to have a baby yes. In my mid 20s. I went through fertility treatments/hormone injections etc but it just didn't work out. I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome so my ovaries grow cysts and spaz out and don't work right I guess. Now, I don't care as much like my husband really wants kids but it's just not in the cards but maybe if he gets a better job or if my art sales pick up we'll consider adopting or fostering.

  when I was an annoying teen I was at the mall being annoying with a friend and some older woman with the thickest unplaceable accent said to us ""I eat chirrun fur breakfast"" I guess she was saying she ate children for breakfast but we made a lot of fun of that after she left and even wrote a song about  her that I don't remember now

  1. I enjoy trick or treaters, and put my lights on and buy heaps of candy every year. Sadly, hardly anyone still does that around here, it's all ""trunk or treats"" because of ""safety"" so I think last year only one little princess came. 2 and 3: I don't answer the door to sales people or evangelists. If I accidentally do for some reason I pretend to have to see to sometimes indoors immediately and shut the door. 4. I've never had any but I would love the hell out of that I'm wild about Christmas around that time of year at least, not like my grandma on my dad's side who kept her decorations up year round 5. I wouldn't answer the door and if I accidentally did I'd not let them use my phone but maybe would offer to make a call for them. Once in my last apartments an older lady needed to use my phone because she needed to call her daughter because she had locked her keys, purse, phone, and grandbaby in her car in the parking lot and I let HER use my phone but I was standing right there.

  The recovery for the immediate pain was about 8 months but I'm still not fully recovered and I never will be. I have lower back pain pretty much always though cannabis helps with that a lot. The joints, once they pop out, sort of don't want to go back, too many muscles hold them taut and out of their intended place so they sort of settled down ALMOST to where they should be but they're kinda like- slightly ajar. They're only responsible for some small amount of movement, like 2 percent but I can't do squats now and I have a hard time bending over/getting down to a kneeling position etc

  I only get snow here normally about 1-2 times a year so that's not too bad. I hate snow. I like where I live because I can go drive up to Mt. St. Helens or whatever to see snow in the summer without having to deal with snow during the winter much.

  you are so tiresome. Go get high and stop trolling me.
  "
168229,"
   I'm not saying create war with Muslims in their own countries, what they do in their countries is there own business, but when they bring their culture over here, that's when there's a problem, western military should leave Islamic countries and Muslims should leave Western countries
  ","
  and what I'm saying is that I can and have lived peacefully with Muslims in my community with no fear because there's nothing to fear from your average Muslim, traditionalist or not. Banning them from the west is racist and extreme.
  "
168230,"
   Of course not all Muslims are extremists but it's estimated that 15-20% of Muslims in America have extremist views, imagine Muslims across the world especially in Islamic countries where the majority are extremists, Islam and the West just simply don't collide.
  ","
  that's a pretty high stat there buddy boy. It's more like 1% and in case you haven't noticed, most of the mass killing here have been done by white dudes not islamic extremists. I'm more likely to die at the hands of some rando with a gun who hates women than a religious extremist.
  "
168231,"
   I don't like Christianity either, the Old Testament is almost as bad as the Quran, however Christianity has had a reform and Christian countries no longer execute people in public, in Islamic countries do, the Quran needs a reform, they're 500 years behind us in Muslim countries
  ","
  If I wanted to fight for reform for those countries, that would mean I was pro war with those countries and I just am not. America has enough on it's plate. I hate that bad things happen to people under the guise of religion but it's not my place to advocate war with another country over it when my own country has ridiculous problems to take care of and conflicts all over for stupid reasons anyway.
  "
168232,"
   But you aren't against it if you allow it to happen, that's like saying I'm against Nazism but I'm willing to let people practice genocide of Jews.
  ","
  Islam is just another religion. Extremists do shitty things. Doesn't mean every Islamic person believes that way. I don't care for Christianity but if I tried to ban that because of the actions of a few extreme people there would be an uproar.
  "
168233,"
   That was tongue in cheek, if you was a true feminist you would be completely against Islam because of Female Circumcision, needing four witnesses for rape, making women cover up, verses into the Quran with advocate beating women, capturing and trading women as sex slaves, I have no room for more
  ","
  I can be against those things and still feel like people should be free to practice their religion
  "
168234,"
   Salafi Islam isn't normal Islam, it's the most extreme form, it's the equivalent of the Westbrook Baptish church but 100x more extreme than that, I've been studying the Quran and the Haddiths since I was 14, I know more about Islam than you

  1. getting an emotional service animal. She's a parakeet and she's really turned my life around. I have panic disorder but with her close by I never have panic attacks anymore.

  3. Switching from an academic focus to an artistic one in school. I need art to release something that gets pent up inside of me. It's important and I'm glad that I was allowed to follow that path young, it's one of the few things about my childhood I'm glad for.
  
  4. marrying my husband. He's been my rock for 13 years. I honestly don't know what would happen to me without his love and support.

  When I was 23 I was working in the back at Target overnights doing merchandising and one night I was rifling through some boxes on the ground under a large metal shelving unit and someone accidentally hit the leg of the unit with a forklift and the entire steel shelf crumbled down with all of the heavy boxes and pallets on it's shelves while I was under it. I jerked myself out of the way of death but managed to dislocate both sacroiliac joints simultaneously and now neither of them work properly and it's caused me major pain and discomfort for the rest of my life. Target paid all the initial medical bills so I didn't sue them.

   I know that schizophrenic patients do not know that they are schizophrenic, so how can you describe your mental illness ?
  ","
  of course we know, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I had to go through diagnosis and have a treatment plan for it just like anyone else with any other disease.
  
  Without treatment, I have visual and audio hallucinations that I know are not real but still permeate my everyday life. I an get very superstitious about certain things to the point of it affecting my living quality. I have delusions of grandeur in that I feel like I'm being targeted by certain people or organizations even though I've certainly never done anything to be targeted by anyone. It's a seriously fucked up disease and it causes all kinds of side effects like psychogenic polydipsia which causes me to be desperately thirsty feeling all the time and also affects how I see optical illusions (I can't see them normally, they flash back and forth between the two illusion types until it causes panic or discomfort) Also it causes my body to not process magnesium and several types of vitamin B properly so I have to take prescription levels of 4 different vitamins just to stay sort of healthy.

Have you ever been rescued by the emergency services? (Police, Fire Service, Ambulance Service, Coastguard/Air-Sea Rescue?) If so and you're comfortable sharing, tell us what happened 🙂 - Doug
  ","
  I have never been rescued but I've been in emergencies where I definitely needed help but ended up just rescuing my damn self.  THREE TIMES I've been swept out to sea in a rip current in Va. Beach, Virginia and three times I've swam out of it on my own while some young kid dressed up as a lifeguard stood on the tower shrugging at me like they didn't know what to do. More recently I was at home without a car and couldn't find anyone to drive me to the hospital but I can't afford an ambulance because American health insurance and medical charges are totally ridiculous so I had to walk myself to the hospital with appendicitis. I made it there before it burst but I was throwing up from pain by the time I got there. Luckily they hooked up an IV full of Norco for that pain pretty quickly

My story is that I had my appendix out last year and since I take probiotics I barely ever fart and after my surgery and having the appendix removed they wouldn't let me go home until I was able to fart because it meant everything was healing appropriately or whatever but I had to stay at the hospital an extra day because I never fart and it took forever.

   What is your favourite home remedy for headaches? I'm just now recovering from a pretty bad one that started yesterday. I know some of you deal (or have dealt) with with much worse pain than that, though, so I'm hoping you'll have some advice.
  ","
  Sorry you're having this problem! Because of prescription drugs that interact with OTC remedies, I can't really take anything for headaches so when I get them, the same options are available to me that are for basically any ailment: smoke some weed, drink a ton of water, and take a nap. This has thankfully cured just about everything that's ailed me for a while now and the few things that it didn't fix were hospital emergencies

   What did you dream about last night?
  ","
  I don't remember a lot- it was part of a series of dreams I've been having for years where I live in a hotel that's part of a mall and I also work in the mall and evil people/scientists who want to catch me to run tests on me are in an underground facility and they occasionally surface. Lately, I've been in the process of moving out of the hotel and into a separate apartment across the street from the mall but it's been an excruciatingly slow move that's lasted probably a year's worth of nights or more now. Also, there's an art school in the mall and I go to school there even though I'm older than all of the other students and I skip my classes regularly.

   ""If you know what it's like to want someone so much you would kill for them. If you know what it's like to feel someone so deep under your skin you would sacrifice everything to protect them even if it screws up your own moral compass. That's what love is."" Do you agree/disagree with this? Thoughts?
  ","
  I don't think love has to be all that intense. Sometimes it's less all-encompassing. It's not healthy to completely let go of yourself for the sake of someone else.

   1695 is an old house! Interesting that the men were affected by it / discomfited more than the women. You mentioned that this could be to do with the place; though I wonder if men are just as easily rattled by such things, if not more so, despite TV and Hollywood stereotypes?
  ","
  We- we being my 4 other female housemates at the time- suspected that the ghost of William Fornis- the man who built and then lived in the house and was buried in the basement- was treating us like his 3 daughters and purposely scaring away men. Everyone heard things. Or had uncomfortable feelings or thoughts. We couldn't get photographs of parties we threw or anything to come out well this was of course back before digital photography was really a thing and we'd waste whole rolls of film on things only to have like, half of one photo come out. But I lived in haunted places previous to that one where all genders were spooked equally so really I think whoever was haunting us in the old house just didn't like men. Or parties.
  "
168571,"
   Have you ever been in a house that was claimed to be haunted? If so, what was it like?
  ","
  Everywhere I lived in Massachusetts was haunted, the whole town of Beverly is basically a ghost haven. I lived in a house built in 1695 that had been turned into two apartments but still had a creepy attic that noises came from it with a window that opened on it's own and a dirt floor basement where people were buried. Male guests had a hard time being comfortable and no one like to stay overnight. The man who built the house had three daughters so we think he was chasing off our suitors.

   What was the recovery process for bunion surgery like?
  ","
  I'm still recovering, it'll be about a year before I'm good to go. For the first 4 months I couldn't use that foot and was on a mobility scooter for 2 months of that. The second two months I had a walking cast. I had hard casts, two of them, and a soft cast before that point. I have a giant scar from midway up my big toe all the way down to the arch of my foot, and nerves still haven't come ""online"" in places so some places on the side of my foot are still numb feeling. I can walk now, but slowly and with supportive shoes only. I still need to get my right foot operated on but I have to wait until my left foot it totally healed. It's painful, it's been a long time, and during the first part of healing I ended up with blood clots in my lungs and legs as a side effect so that was more time in the hospital than I had hoped plus I'm on expensive blood thinners now until July. It's still better than the constant pain of the bunion though, and I'll be glad when both of my feet are bunion-free.

  my day just started so I'll talk about yesterday. It wasn't great. I talked to my dad and he was rude about my mental illnesses, suggesting that since I was no longer seeing a therapist regularly I should be ""cured enough"" to take on more responsibilities and do things outside of my comfort zone. It doesn't really work that way, as most people understand. I'm stuck with managing schizophrenia symptoms until dementia takes over there isn't a ""cured"" status.

I don't know if I'd give him a carrot kiss but I love the idea of therapy llamas.He was very soft and calm. I didn't get to hang out with any llamas the couple of times I was in the hospital last year but we did have a therapy dog come by and that was super cute. They gave me a little trading card with facts about the dog on it the whole thing was adorable.

  I only have the one parakeet but she has enough personality for a flock. She's very adventurous, affectionate, bossy, and confident. She loves to explore and try new foods and places, she loves to fight with her mirror friend, she loves to boss the cats and me around (she's known to fly towards them and run after them like a big bully), she loves to give me kisses and rub her fluffed out head feathers against my cheek and is quick to run to my fingers when she wants cheek scritches.

  ","
  Bubo has three feline flockmates, Rin, Kyo, and Mimi. Rin is very much a cat and wants to hunt Bubo. Bubo is a little wary of Rin. Kyo is terrified of Bubo. She's a bully with him because she knows he'll run away. She likes to peck at his tail and jump on his back when he's asleep. Mimi and Bubo have some sort of understanding. Mimi is very patient with Bubo and lets her ride her and preen her fur. I don't let them hang out too much because I have to supervise so closely just in case and because Mimi only tolerates it and while she's patient now who knows how long that will last.

When I first started going to visit my parakeet at the nursery she was born at, there was a group of cages in the back where the bonding area was for not-so-nice parrots. One of them is Norman, who needs to stay in his cage unless supervised because he's a biter. Norman has a friend named Carmen, who is allowed to wander and normally doesn't do anything other than hang outside of Norman's cage. I was there with my bby, she flew out of my hands and under Carmen, Carmen pretended he was going to groom my hair so I held out my arm for him to perch on while I grabbed my baby, and instead of perching he deliberately and slowly bit me. Parrots can be total assholes.

  Anyone can draw. It takes natural ability maybe to make a drawing interesting to others or to have a coherent feeling expressed but the act of drawing itself can be taught to anyone for sure. It's all in how you look at things around you really. Drawing a still life doesn't start with outlines of the objects, it starts with where the shadows and lights fall. If you draw the shadows and leave or erase the lights then you're probably already approaching drawing in a different way than before. That's what I've taught people to do.

When gamergate came along, and the infamous ""sjw"" list, gators were using twitter and ask as platforms to harass people from the list (I was number 5,000 something on the list and still managed to get my own little group of dedicated asshats) so pretty much everyone I followed at that time just stopped using it altogether. I started following some of the people I had seen ask decent questions, and formed my little group of people I follow over the years but I don't really reach out or socialize here much. I've been on the fence about being here basically the whole time I've been here and now that I'm not even in the gaming industry, it's weird that people follow me at all but I do appreciate that. I have stayed mostly because it's interesting to see what other people ask and answer and though I don't send out questions as often as I once did it's nice to have that option I guess. The premise of the site is interesting to me. Curiouscat just doesn't have the same ease of use, imo.

  friendship is when you're comfortable with and feel good about someone who also feels good about and is comfortable with you. Friendships just sort of happen organically- you meet someone, you click, you keep making plans to talk to that person again because their company is fun and not stressful. People can be my friend by talking to me and seeing where it goes- if I warm up eventually then I'm finding you to be a friend. It takes me a long time to be comfortable with someone and I don't always click with people so maybe it is hard to earn with me, I don't know.

   You're in an old pub with a roaring fire and you have to recount one story of something weird or inexplicable that you've seen or experienced in your life ... which tale do you tell?
  ","
  I lived in Massachusetts for a while in college, in an apartment building in an area that had originally been part of Salem which as most know has a long and spooky history. Many of the houses around us were built in the late 1600s or roundabouts. One holiday weekend when everyone was out of the building (except for me, one RA and a handful of other students who couldn't or didn't travel home for long weekends) shit got weird.
  
  It started with me sitting in my living room on a winter day, windows closed and heat on as one does. I was chain smoking and listening to music while doing homework. After getting up to get a soda, I noticed a smell. a strong, dangerous smell- linseed oil. Across the apartment somehow my roommate's oil painting supplies had upturned on their own and soaked half of the floor. The fumes were unbearable and as I ran to the window to open it, all four burners of our gas stove came on by themselves. There could have been an explosion if I hadn't acted so fast I'm sure of it or at least a fire.
  
  I got things as clean and operational as possible, sat down on the sofa to rest, and noticed that the curtains in my bedroom were waving wildly, standing almost straight out- with a closed window. As I went down the short hallway to investigate, the door slammed in my face and I decided that this was enough I wasn't playing with ghosts anymore. I started yelling that I wasn't scared (I was) and that this was MY home and they needed to leave. As a response, every light in the house turned off.
  
  I walked around, terrified, turning each light back on one by one while talking a big game about being not scared and demanding I be left alone. The last lamp refused to turn on. I felt like every hair on my body was standing up, I didn't feel safe, so I went downstairs to ask my RA to come up and tell me I was imagining things.
  
  When he got there, the bedroom doors were open and the windows were closed and all of the lights were on. However, as he walked towards the hallway, the curtains did the thing again and the door closed again and he noped out and took me back to his place for the night until he could get his friend who was a witch to come over and cleanse the place the next day.
  
  We didn't have any other problems past that other than one of my roommates swearing she could hear voices in the walls.

I was really popular in high school and college and it's been hard as an adult to watch those people dwindle away. I don't think I'm a bad friend but maybe I am. I have so many mental illnesses it's hard to be the most reliable. But I try so hard and it kills a part of me that so many fewer people care.

The artist sets the price but the default setting and what most people keep it around is 20% so you have to sell a substantial amount to see real profit but for me it's just been great watching stickers get bought/knowing people wanted a little piece of my art the 20 cents doesn't matter as much as the good feels

After that I had a couple of months worry-free but not long after I took a trip across the country to see my family and had my own mother flip out and refuse to see me. From there I had foot surgery twice over, and that resulted in several blood clots forming in my leg and making their way to my lungs so I was hospitalized for pulmonary emboli. After an ultrasound, two more large clots were found in my leg so I have to take awful blood thinner medicine for like, 6 months now. On top of that my heroes David Bowie, Prince, and Carrie Fischer all passed so 2016 was a tire fire.

  periods are terrible beasts that do whatever they want. Been stressed? Major change in your life? MINOR change in your life? Your period will latch on to that and decide to be weird.

   What actions should be taken to extinguish the stigma of mental illness, in your opinion?
  ","
  Education and awareness are important. Public education campaigns about mental illnesses would make a huge impact I think as far as normalizing mental illness and helping people feel more comfortable seeking help.
  
  Those of us who are mentally ill and are able to safely and comfortably educate those around them should. Being open and honest when presenting your symptoms and how you cope to those in your life can make things easier and less problematic for everyone involved. Those people take away important lessons about mental illness and why it shouldn't be stigmatized when it's been made normal in their immediate circles of friends and family.
  
  We all as a whole can limit or completely eliminate usage of ableist slurs like ""crazy"", ""insane"", ""mental"", ""psycho"", etc. from our vocabularies, especially when referring to a negative object, action, or trait. Using these words just continues to separate the mentally ill from the rest and paints us as bad/undesirable/something to be feared.

  ","
  My great-aunt and I have tracked my father's line-following the men-all the way back to the 1200s. Sadly that's how it works- it's easier to search patriarchal lines. I know literally nothing about my father's mother's line because she was adopted, and my mother's side I only have tracked back about 7 or so generations because of name changes and unmarried women with children. It's harder to search matriarchal sides because the last names are all different.
  
  ANYWAY I'm a Plantagenet descendant with multiple counts of royalty from England, France, and Portugal on my patriarchal family line. Our crest varies through the years but generally contains crosses and white or red.

  the government doesn't need to be responsible for everything, firstly. It makes me uncomfortable to consider the government in charge of ""what to do"" with any group of people unless that thing to do is protecting rights.
  
  Anyway. Not everyone's worth is in what they produce. Maybe when jobs are no longer plentiful a more socialist society will have to be adopted to educate and enrich the population while taking care of them as well. This doesn't have to be a big government concern, it would probably be most beneficial to govern in small city groupings or whatnot if it came down to that.

  Well, foremost, my grandmother had another heart attack today in West Virginia and I'm across the country in Washington so I can't go be with her and I hate that. I also hate that she's under 100 lbs. and it makes me feel like my uncle isn't taking good enough care of her and I'm ready to move her out here with me but I don't think she'd ever agree to it. I wish I could take care of her. It would help both of us to be on a regular meal plan and have someone to look out for us.
  
  Secondly, we put an offer in on a house last night and are hoping to hear something about that tomorrow sometime so we're nervous, we've already had two houses we loved bought out with really impossible-to-match offers. I'm ready to be out of these apartments.
  
  In three days, I meet with the GI doctor about some irregularities seen when I was having my appendectomy last month. I've been worried for a while about this, and I guess he'll be recommending a colonoscopy and we'll go from there but something looked weird enough in there to alert my surgeon at any rate.
  
  my bird has been such a great help to me, I haven't had a panic attack in a while now, and even today with all of these things weighing on me I feel relatively calm. I think about his amazing influence a lot, I'm grateful for my feathered friend.

He directed traffic, gave cheerful weather predictions, and did what he could to bring smiles to everyone he saw. I have so many fond memories of Red helping me by grabbing a couple of bags of my groceries to carry them home, or looking out for me when I had to walk home late at night from work. When I did window displays on the main street of town, he gathered up all of the other bums and gave me an audience, clapping when I was finished like I'd created the most beautiful window display they'd ever seen lol. Sadly, I hear he's since passed but I still think about him a lot.

Instead of trying to get out of exams maybe they should be eager to work through them, do well, and become adults who can make sure that the school systems in their area are funded and well-run so that the system continues to work for future generations.

   Best job you ever had?

  merchandising asst. manager for Tamarack:The Best of West Virginia, which is this HUUUUGE state-run artisan showcase for West VA craftspeople and artisans in Beckley, WV. Basically, I ran around making beautiful displays of product all day everyday. It was HARD WORK and extremely taxing on my body but when I was able to do that, it was what I was meant to do. Previous to this job, I had done window dressing in Beverly, MA and the two jobs together were probably the most happy I've ever been while employed.

  it's hard to describe, it's just a gut feeling. When I meet someone, I get a wave of energy from them and generally my interpretation of that energy seems fairly accurate despite what happens in the first few meetings. There have been times I've suppressed my initial feelings and become close to someone anyway and it's been really bad in all cases.
  
  Sometimes I feel warned by someone, but still feel like they're a good person. Then I have to decide if their strengths and weaknesses that they show on getting to know them farther outweigh the warning.

If it was someone who wanted my affection and reciprocated caring and affection but just didn't have the self-esteem to accept that they were worthy of care, then I'd just be patient.

  I used to be pretty alright at dancing, even competed locally in swing dancing competitions and shit in my early 20s, but after a bad back injury I don't know how great I am anymore. I did just buy a used Xbox and Dance Central games so I'm looking forward to trying that, it looks fun. I probably wouldn't want to join a show, I would hate the pseudo-fame that comes with being on a reality show.

   Why is Socialist like a bad word in the U.S ?
  ","
  I wish I knew. Conservatives in this country are so blinded by tradition and ""values"" that they can't comprehend anything that seems to oppose that or at least offers a different viewpoint. Compassion and justice are less important to them than the words in a book written by white men with delusions of grandeur. Not that I'm anti-religion, because I absolutely am not- I think that it's comforting to think that there's a God above who looks over us- but if that's the case then I feel pretty strongly that he or she wants us to progress and be good to each other and our communities, not continuously knock down anyone outside of the white cis straight male Christian demographic.
  
  It's hard not to think that it's an intelligence thing. I've never been especially impressed by the intelligence of any very conservative citizens. The smartest conservatives I've met were also working for social justice despite their political and religious views.

  I was at a retro game convention and stressing out because of the crowd, trying to calm down and cool off enough that I could maybe look at vendors again or wait for a turn to play Carnival or Yar's Revenge in the retrocade and Jon decided to go see what the local indie devs were showing and dragged me over there even though I was definitely not calm enough to do so yet. There was a game that was really quite eye-catching called Smooth Operator and I talked to one of the devs for a few moments and she and I played a game- Smooth Op is essentially a kissing simulator, but with style. Kate, the producer, and I got a reallllly high score, meaning our ""kissing"" was really compatible lol. I grabbed her card and followed her on twitter.

  ooh fun! I recommend anything that has pictures you think you'll enjoy coloring, but I personally especially like books that only print pictures on one side of the paper so that you don't  have to worry about ink and markers bleeding through and messing up another page- those that do that AND have perforated edges so you can easily tear them out are my favorite book features. Being left-handed, being able to tear the page out to work on helps me out a lot. Mandala books are very popular, as are patterns and animal and plant designs, but there are coloring books of all sorts out there. Saw a star wars one the other day that I wish I had bought but it was hard cover and pricey.

  It's interesting. One thing I struggle with lately is convincing myself that memories aren't ""real"", that they're just my version of things and are viewed differently by others involved.

Of course, she could also look completely human when she wanted as well, and is said to have mothered children with one of the lords of the Plantagenet house, from which I'm descended.....

   I've never tried getting stoned, is it too late to start experimenting with that kind of thing in your 30s?
  ","
  I'm 36, and while I tried marijuana first in college, it was definitely not the same thing as the marijuana of nowadays. I don't consider myself really becoming a smoker until I was like, 34 which was after it had already been made legal for recreational use in my state (we'd been legal for medical purposes here since 1998 but I didn't get my medical recommend until after it was legal recreationally)
  
  I started when I re-dislocated a sacro-iliac joint in my lower back and was having intense muscle pain, and found that indica strains with a lot of CBD really helped with that. I started experimenting with other strains and found that hybrids containing certain sativa properties, who had a good amount of terpenes, were reallllly helpful for anxiety and staying focused for me, so that's mainly what I smoke nowadays. Much better as-needed panic medication for me than anything else I have in my arsenal, and it's changed my life. I'm able to go out into public more, be social more, attend functions and conventions, travel, all things that I was too anxious to do much of before. It absolutely improved my quality of life.

  Ugh, I HATED gym class. I was the person convincing the teacher I had period cramps basically every day. Looking back, I see the value of encouraging students to learn team work and that exercise should be an important part of one's day. I don't think it has to be exclusive to those who are other-abled, but at least back in the 80s and 90s it certainly was. I think that if educators are able to create a plan that includes everyone, and expectations come away from the whole meeting the presidential fitness award or doing x amount of push-ups or being the best baseball team in the tri-state or whatever and instead focused more on staying healthy and simple calisthenics and team play, it's valuable.

Also, language. I was unfortunate in that I was assigned a Spanish 2 and Spanish 3 teacher that I absolutely LOATHED in high school and I didn't retain nearly as much as I would have liked because of it.

   What is the difference between revenge and justice, in your opinion? If you intend to make someone ""pay for what they've done"" (for example, if they murder your parents), does it make you just or vengeful? When does mere justice morph into vengeance and why?

  Revenge is fueled by anger, pain, envy- it requires the ""wronged"" party to mete out the justice rather than leaving it to a non-passionate third party or ""fate"" or whatever else. Justice steps back and allows the systems in place to work, or at least works towards making sure that those systems work better. It's the fairer, more logical of the two.

  lol nothing that ever saw the rest of the world. My former partner and I had several we were working on over the past 3 years, I'd been attending conferences and making contacts for the past 2 years, we were at a point on our main endeavor where all of the concept work was finished and animations were starting and we were ready to start making videos and blogging and release information and then he was diagnosed with BPD, spiraled out of control, split me off, and destroyed our mutual file share accounts. We had signed several legal documents in the beginning of this mess, and I'm prevented from re-using any of the art I did from his concepts.
  
  Anyway all of this came after over a year of constant medical nightmares for me and personal tragedy for him already and the culminating blow-up destroyed me in a lot of ways and now game development is kind of a trigger for me. It's been really important to my therapist that I focus on creating just for myself for the next while, doing simple artistic/creative things for the joy of it without pressure because with everything that's happened to me and around me in the past 2 years I started basically just falling apart.
  
  If I am ever well again, and choose to work on a game, it will likely be solo. I'll just learn to code or whatever and simplify my ideas. I have some basic knowledge of it. I literally put hundreds of hours of my life into projects that are now never going to come to fruition and I don't think I'll ever be able to take that risk- involving someone else-  with a creative endeavor again, art is too much a part of my actual self identity.

   What was  the most pointless argument you've been passionately involved in? How did it end ?

  I like to think that the arguments I get very passionate during are about fairly important things. When people bring silly, childish, pointless shit to me, I might get angry but I'm not really going to fight back or fight for that person or that relationship in any way.
  
  For instance, recently a close friend of mine didn't like that I had an opposing view to an article about a woman's response to gendered harassment and he chose to have a total fit and delete me from all of our social networks and then sub-tweet me, attacking my past relationships and me in ways that were just beyond infantile.  I didn't get passionate about it. I mean, okay, I said some angry shit but the main take-away was ""welp, that was fucking pointless"" and I have no regrets or grief over that loss.
  
  Fights I've gotten reaaallllly passionate about it's only been because the fight wasn't so ridiculous that it made me stop respecting someone. When I still care, when I still value someone, I'll fight for that relationship. I terribly miss a friend of mine who ended our relationship several months ago, and I would fight for him over and over again if I could.  For now, though, I need healing.

  They are attracted to the vinegar to drink- and normally, can land on the surface and then fly away- but the Dawn changes the surface tension, so when they land, they sink under the surface and drown- and the vinegar breaks down their bodies so you don't even have to see a bunch of corpses, just sort of a weird sludge in the bottom.

Otherwise, I try to remember that a lot of the things I love that are problematic are also really old, so there's a certain amount of excusing I do for that I think. James Bond, however, is and always has been a franchise built on womanizing and being ""alpha white male"" so I'm not exactly in love with that mess. It's boring.

   Is there anything that makes you doubt your own sanity? If so, what is it and why?
  ","
  I'm schizophrenic. During episodes- which are thankfully very infrequent (though I've been having one since November, it is the first major episode since 2002 so in a way I feel pretty happy about that) I often feel concerned about my level of sanity. I can tell the difference between auditory delusions/visual hallucinations and reality easily, and once I take my meds and give a bit of rational thought to things I can sort through the paranoia- but a new thing this episode for me is ""losing time"" and THAT is really fucking me up.
  
  The tipping point into this episode was a breakup with my former best friend and business partner. I was already having an incredibly hard time with my mental health because of some major physical health concerns and cptsd triggers, but that pushed me over the edge into dangerous territory.
  
  My first instance of ""lost time"" concerns him, and that situation. A few weeks ago, I noticed the thumb ring I'd been wearing for over a year- it's one I bought in Utah when I last visited my friend and his family. It reminded me of him, and the trip. I looked at the ring, sighed, and went on with my day but I didn't touch or remove it.
  
  The next day, my hand felt strange and I soon realized that the ring was gone. I spent several days in huge frantic spurts looking everywhere for this ring. I do not remember ever removing it. I didn't normally remove it for any reason short of MRIs. But now it's gone. Somewhere in that day's worth of time, I removed it, put it somewhere or threw it away, and then immediately blocked all memories of this. I still don't know where it is, and I've since purchased a new thumb ring to hopefully attach new, healing memories too.
  
  That shit fucking scares me though.

   In psychology, they teach that people are afraid of offending others merely because they fear being offended themselves. How would you explain that?
  ","
  Maybe for some people? I don't feel that's the case with me at all. I'm not afraid of being offended, I'm afraid of giving others the impression that I'm unlovable or unworthy because I feel unlovable and unworthy. Has nothing to do with fear of offense, more fear of abandonment or dislike. I can see why this is a theory, though, especially for those with panic disorders or who are prone to panic attacks, if being offended causes panic then a fear of anything that could cause another attack is pretty normal.

  I kinda feel like that's always a low-key responsibility of any empathetic and caring human being to some degree. Maybe not to the point of hyper-vigilance or anything, but I feel like it's important to try to be as helpful and understanding as you can when others come to you with their problems on their journeys forward. When possible, at least, obviously everyone has their dark days where they can't be much help to others because they need to help themselves. I feel like we'd all be a bit better off if we gave honest advice and genuine care to each other.

I'm allergic to a ton of stuff as well, so I don't wear much when I do- at least, not on my face. My eyes or lips I'll do up sometimes but I never really have more on my face than a Korean BB Cream (their requirements are stricter and ingredients are much easier on sensitive skin- the US lets all sorts of nasty chemically stuff sit on the market) and some translucent powder because anything more than that will break me out into hives.

It definitely doesn't help with the little ones acting up, since around here apparently bringing a 6 month old, a 2 year old, and a 6 year old to an R rated movie is the norm and I've yet to see any movie in this town where there wasn't at least one mom with several inappropriately-aged kids going wild. I've never liked theaters. I keep making exceptions because I want to see things, and then regretting the decision. I'm just done with the whole experience. There's no benefit for me to watch a movie that I already think is way too loud- when the large screen gives me a headache- that I can't get comfortable in because of dirt and distractions- and that I can't pause when I have to pee. Thanks for trying to help though, I know people reallllly love the theater experience but I just do not.

I ended up having to use the bathroom and I went and got Corey's mom expecting her to put us in the van and take me to a proper potty but instead she made me huddle behind the van and pee in a jug while she held up a blanket and I was so mortified that I stopped liking Corey because I was afraid I'd have to go on another play date.

  There's nothing wrong with a fetish. There is something wrong with coming at someone anonymously with shitty questions and then having a fit over their answers if they don't go the way you hoped. You have no right to continue to bother me after I asked you not to. You are invading my personal boundaries. You are being, in short, an annoying little shit. I'm blocking you now.

  "
169972,"

  ","
  ""Making"" someone do something is wrong, sure. If it's a silly thing like- an agreement was made or a bet was had and it resulted in foot massages, then shrug. I mean, are guns being held to heads? Are these younger sisters and brothers being blackmailed with information that is going to ruin their adult lives? At the base of it there is a consent issue, no one should be made to do something they are against. But really. This seems like a family thing that probably has more to the story than ""Susie made Tommy and Alice rub her feet against their wills"".

  I mean, I was the oldest, and I was a brat to my younger sister and brother too sometimes I'm sure- but I didn't  have the luxury of fucking around and making people massage my feet, I was too busy trying to make sure we survived an abusive mother. Like, if this is your biggest concern, then maybe you should just be thankful.
  
  But since this is probably just the lead in to another stream of anon foot fetish questions, I'm not sure why I bothered answering anyway.

  My cat Kyo is being especially annoying right now and doesn't deserve a party, so I'll describe the party I'd give him if he WASN'T such a terrible cutie.
  
  His favorite treats are those soft Whiskas (I think?) cat treats with the cheese centers, strawberry yogurt (just a tablespoon!), and the leftover dust and crumbs from a bowl of cheese-flavored snacks, like Cheetos or Doritos or whatnot. So I'd have a pile of treats for him and a few smaller piles for his guests (his sisters, Rin and Mimi), and on either side of his pile would also be a plate with a dollop of yogurt and a bowl with fake cheese dust sprinkled generously (the other two cats don't care about those things).
  
  We would play chase the laser, try to get the dangly thing out of mom's hands, and roll around in catnip and run fast. His gift would be a few bright green fuzzy mice and the plastic curls from a few gallons of milk.

  I am terrified of monkeys, big or small or not-actually-monkeys-but-basically-the-same-sort-of-animals like gorillas and whatnot.
  
  It's probably because of the one-armed chimp they used to have at the Virginia Zoo in Norfolk iin the early '80s, because he was loud and mean and they had to keep him separate from the others because he would fight them to the death... and being an ignorant kid, I once threw a pine cone in the cage before they removed him from the gen pop, when I was maybe 4. That mean old one-armed chimpanzee went APESHIT and it was the scariest thing I'd ever seen.

  I think when you commit to someone long-term, it's hard to realize and remember at that time that people change so much and over such a wide variety of ways as time passes. I've found that being able to still like who someone is at their core is the most important thing in a marriage or long-term commitment, because who you say ""I do"" to is probably going to have totally different feelings about a lot of things 10 years down the road... and that can include anything from what turns them on to what their political views are to how they identify themselves to what jam they prefer on their toast. Both of you change. It's been both surprising and interesting to watch how we've changed over the years and still remained able to love and care for each other. It's not always easy but we've worked well so far.

  Probably about the same as for any other ""getting to know people"" situations, but to be honest while I do become fond of people often and fairly quickly, it takes a lot of interaction and mutual care before I really ""fall"" for someone. Plus, I've been married for  nearly 12 years so crushes that become that intense rarely happen. Not that they don't, I'm not saying I'm the perfect wifey who never looks at other people and finds them attractive or emotionally important, but at the end of the day my husband prefers monogamy at this time and that's where we are with that.

  If circuses were taking the same steps as many modern zoos are and working towards a more educational approach that included animals who were being rehabilitated or can't be released into the wild for whatever reasons, then they would be okay.
  
  Sadly, at least from what little I'm aware of, most are not.
  
  There's nothing wrong with rescuing an animal from a situation that it wouldn't survive in to train it to be a teaching tool for the goal of future conservation and protection of others like it. For instance, the Audubon society near me has an albino barred owl who was rejected by it's mother and would not have made it with it's non-camouflaged coloring. It is now taken good care of and is a calm, friendly addition to the center.

  1. Emmitt Otter's Jugband Christmas

  3. Elf
  
  I don't have specific memories attached really, other than my dad also really loves Peanuts and Muppets so the first two are movies we both enjoy a lot, and he's basically Buddy Elf when it comes to Christmas, so I guess yeah. I like Christmas movies because they are things that my dad and I are both really excited about so it's a bonding thing, maybe? I dunno. My dad wasn't around a ton as a kid because my parents were divorced when I was 3 and my mother limited visitation pretty strictly because she's a Borderline Narcissist so good memories from my childhood with my father are few and far between but not in a way that's anyone but my mother's fault, if that makes sense.

(this was not a full-nude bar- at the time the law where I lived was that you couldn't wear less than a bathing suit- so ample nipple coverage and at the very least a bikini-cut bottom.)

Those three things I almost always get at that specific place, but if we're talking just in-general sorts of buffets I probably will go for things like chicken with cashew nuts, fried rice, anything with mushrooms, beef and broccoli just to get some greens, and of course an almond cookie for dessert.

  As far as the accident thing, it really depends on the level of seriousness. If it's like- someone lied about being unable to perform a specific physical task in a job that requires it, and then worsens a pre-existing condition or whatever, then yeah, it's just that person's fault, but when it comes to something like, I dunno- a brain surgeon lies about having the proper schooling and then patients die, then that's also on the hospital that hired him without checking credentials.

   Describe your ideal home. What would it look like (cottage; castle, boat ect), how would the rooms be decorated, where would it be, who would live there? Just go into as much detail as possible about your dream/ideal living place and its surrounding area?
  ","
  I would love a average sized house (like, 3 br/ 2.5 bath or whatever) that sits in a clearing at the end of a longish, curving driveway through the woods. I'd have an acre or two where I grew various herbs and flowers to distill into oils, as well as 2-3 bee hives. I'd learn to make soap, and have a work shed with big sinks and counters.
  
  For the living part of the house, I think I lean more towards the ""whatever, that's cute, put it there"" school of decorating nowadays though in the past I was much more particular about color themes and shit. I want bright colors and kitsch and cat-friendly and comfort. I have a ton of art that I've either done or purchased everywhere now, so that would still be the case.
  
  I'd have lots of natural sunlight, and a cozy patio in the back with a fire pit. It would probably be here in Washington, somewhere surrounded by trees with a view of a snow-capped mountain. It would be out of town a bit, but not far enough to not have city water/sewage and good internet.

  Sure, it's definitely important. Especially intimacy. I can't see a relationship working for very long without the trust and openness that comes from being intimate with someone, even if sex isn't a part of that equation. As far as sex goes, it's a need we all have- though some more than others.
  
  Experience is so not important. Not stressing out and being honest and genuine are what make sex more enjoyable, not time-tested moves.

   What smell instantly reminds you of Christmas and why?

  Cinnamon, peppermint, cloved orange, cider, a baking Virginia ham, bloody mary mix. My paternal grandfather's girlfriend (after my grandmother passed), Miss Essie as we called her, always has a big Christmas party on Christmas Eve that lasts all day long, and cooks a ham and everyone brings a little something and gets drunk. There was often hot cider or some sort of kid-safe spiced hot drink for us as well. Her house was always decorated for Christmas year-round, which is something my grandmother started when my dad was a kid and all of their close friends picked up in her honor. It's one of the reasons I love Xmas trees so much, as everyone on my dad's side growing up (except for my dad, but he does go all out at actual Xmas time) had their tree up all year and just changed out decorations. Anyway, a lot of her decorating included those cinnamon brooms and pine cones, so her little house had a lot of cinnamon and food smells. Those were good times, I am sad I didn't keep in better touch with that group.

  The man is to blame, he is the person who made a commitment to someone else, not the woman. If it were MY relationship, I would probably have some questions but overall would be pretty okay. I have a hard time agreeing with the whole concept of marriage meaning ownership of my sexuality, and honestly feel like I'd do better in a poly relationship, but my husband isn't comfortable with that at this time. If he were to find someone else, I'd be overall glad that he realized that someone else might meet some of his needs better than I can, and that that's alright with me.

  - gallery opening

  - literally ran into on street corner while not paying attention

  - swing dance instructor
  
  - karaoke bar
  
  - co-worker
  
  - another co-worker

   Do you believe that home ownership is really something people should strive for, as a life achievement?

  Not as a life achievement, certainly. I think there's been a recent shift as far as what is perceived as the ""timeline of adulthood"" that we've always been told to adhere to (college, marriage, house, family, etc). The economic climate, the amount of schooling required for so many of the desirable jobs, more acceptance of different family definitions, and so many other things have made renting or taking home ownership at a different pace than before the new norm.
  
  Personally I still want to own a home one day, but mainly because I want a yard or a little bit of land to buffer me from other people's noise, a chance to customize things to how I like them, and some beehives.

Each person would need to be willing and able to survive under whatever conditions, and there would probably be tests devised to measure those sorts of things in the screening process.

  I suppose it's a saying meant to state than when the man of the house gets home, he's the King. Which is gross. My mother always used to scream at me that there could only be one Queen in a castle, as she felt like I didn't give her enough deference. It seems to be just another shitty saying giving the head of the household some semblance of power in this crap world.

  I'm not the biggest Fleetwood Mac fan, but here's a fun fact: When I was a kid we still had access to 8-TRACK PLAYERS and I had the ""Rumors"" 8-track cartridge O_o

   I think you'd make a great vampire. Which vampiric universe would you hope was accurate when it comes to vampire's abilities and weaknesses?
  ","
  To be honest I'm not especially familiar with many of the vampire universes at this point. I never read Anne Rice's novels or the Twilight books. Typical Dracula-type lore seems to have too many ways to die. The Buffyverse would mean some messed up forehead wrinkle action, and not being able to be in sunlight, Tru Blood vamps can't do the sunlight thing either plus have the realllllly gory, sticky deaths....but that might be okay if I had a faerie hanging around to let me sip on. I guess I'd have to pick the new AHS vamps, even though I don't know much about them yet- they don't morph into fanged wrinkle-heads, they can enjoy limited amounts of sunlight, and while they seem to be able to BE immortal, they're not invincible so that seems like a good thing to know after a few thousand years or whatever when things are just atrociously awful and boring.

   If you were an immortal - by whatever definition - living amongst humanity, how would you pass the time?  Would you make efforts to remain hidden?  Would you wander and experience everything the worlds has to offer?  Would you collect, or become a scholar? Or a master criminal?
  ","
  Like many of the others I've seen answer your question so far, I'd want to establish some sort of wealth or at least set things up so that I could accrue wealth, by whatever means necessary. Living forever is going to be quite expensive. While doing that, the time would likely be passed learning, exploring, finding ways to enrich my now endless life. I'd want to keep it hidden from people, except maybe a very select few. I feel like there would be too much risk of abduction and experimentation. Then again, maybe once I'd done everything I feel I could do in the world, I ought to donate myself to select scientific communities to study, maybe whatever it is that makes me immortal could help cure something in mortals, who knows.
  
  I mean, unless I'm a vampire. Then I'm gonna spend it drinking people's blood and scaring teens and shit.

She says we walked past it and I didn't say a word, just reached out to it like it was the only thing I could see anymore and when she picked it up and handed it to me, I hugged it and didn't want to let go. So Snoopy and I were besties for years. I still have him in storage, though his ears, nose, arms, legs, and tail have all been re-sewn about a zillion times and he's quite grey now.

I try to always stay very open about what I'm going through because I am able to without too much of a tax on my well-being.

  As far as taboo and should remain that way, I'm not sure.

   I apologise in advanced if this question upsets anyone; feel free to delete: growing up did you have a good childhood? Were your parents over protective or did you have the freedom to do as you pleased? What (if anything) would you change about your childhood?
  ","
  I had a terrible childhood. My mother is a high-functioning, untreated Narcissist with Borderline Personality Disorder. My earliest memories mostly include myself as barely a toddler, 2 or 3, climbing across my crib to the dresser and then down so I could go feed myself breakfast because Mom wouldn't be rolling out of bed for several hours. From the time my parents divorced at age 3 until my ex-stepfather moved in, I have no memories of my mother past seeing her chain smoke while talking to her girlfriends on the phone. HBO and MTV were basically my only companions until my baby sister was old enough to join me in our neglect. Once she was older, I was responsible for her as well. I was the 4th grader packing our lunches and making sure we had our homework and were ready for school. I was also the 4th grader wearing stiletto heels to walk to school with 6 colors of eye shadow piled on because I had no mom to look at me and say WTF you can't wear that.
  
  When I was 10, my mom and ex-stepdad had a son, and things changed slightly but ONLY because he got all freaked out over shit finally once it applied to his ""real"" kid. At that point, I became the ""scapegoat"". My brother the baby was the ""Golden Child"" and my sister avoided conflict and attention as much as possible by keeping her head down and doing whatever Mom said, essentially forcing her to pretend she was my mother at that age to appease my mother (playing softball even though she hated it, having boyfriends at the skating rink, all the same shit that was important to my mother as a teen).
  
  I was in constant conflict with her because I'd spent a decade being the adult of the house and I wasn't keen on suddenly being told what to do, especially by someone who so clearly had no fucking idea what she was doing. She approved of literally nothing I did, picking fights literally just to make me cry. None of my friends were good enough, all of my teachers were out to get me- she hated for me to have a relationship with anyone else besides her because this woman who barely fucking looked at me most of my childhood suddenly was jealous and mad that I didn't want to be her bff and number one daughter.
  
  Her neglect possibly lead to sexual abuse by one of her boyfriends. I've had flashbacks but I have nothing to go on. And the parties. No 5 year old should have to wake up and carefully step over strange men on the floor passed out. I remember trying to pour some rare and tasty orange juice from the fridge only to realize it had vodka in it after a sip.
  
  Anyway all of this culminated in me not speaking to her anymore and not having a relationship with my (now total sociopath, woman-beating) half-brother, or his dad who got a divorce like 5 or 6 years ago or some mess.
  
  I would love to have had a real mom. I used to daydream about my mom's friend Cam being my mom instead.

   Trigger warning: Self harm
So, I've been feeling ""better"" overall., but having more desires to physically harm myself than usual. Is this something to worry about? My therapist suggested it's part of my OCD, but it's been getting worse over the last few weeks.
  ","
  I'm glad you're feeling better :) Sorry I couldn't think up more questions, I've been going through some shit too.
  
  Self harm as part of OCD? I'm sure it's possible, I don't have any experience with that personally but there are a lot of things affected by it certainly. One of my OCD sub-types is Compulsive Skin Picking Disorder, but it's not done as a form of self harm at all, but because I'm compulsively trying to ""smooth"" out rough spots as a form of Contamination OCD.
  
  If you are harming yourself in order to feel something, or to punish yourself, sometimes that also falls into personality disorder categories, or possibly bipolar behavior. I recently read a book called ""Stop Walking on Eggshells"" about having loved ones with Borderline Personality Disorder, and I know self harm is one of the common symptoms of BPD. It's an interesting read if you're into that sort of thing.
  
  Sure, it's something to worry about. But is worrying about it going to make you obsess over it more? Is it something maybe to just be mindful of and consider carefully? Next time, think about why you're doing it. Consider what sensation you particularly want to feel. Can it be duplicated in a less damaging way? I have a friend who crushes ice cubes in his hands rather than punching himself. I remember someone in one of my college classes who snapped a thick rubber band against her wrist when she wanted to cut.

  I was 16 and my friend's older brother was having a graduation party at his house so I walked down there with my sister and brother to have a hotdog and say ""hi"" or whatever but I ended up chatting with this guy who had just graduated from my high school who I sort of knew and we ended up taking a walk around the block- and it started raining- and he kissed me in the rain, standing in someone else's yard. I don't remember anything about the kiss itself. I ended up dating that guy very briefly because my mother for whatever reason encouraged me to date adults as a young teen but I ended up breaking his heart before anything was very serious.

  I'm someone who feels guilt inappropriately. I feel cripplingly guilty over things I have zero control over. It rarely has anything to do with anything I've actually done. Normally, I'm okay with the choices I make and feel that I am morally ""good"" though maybe that doesn't always line up with other's ideas of that or whatever. I don't generally feel too guilty over my actions, I guess, unless they were a bad choice that I didn't think through thoroughly.

  I have a lot of anxiety and panic issues, that I'm being told now are likely caused by this tumor on my pituitary gland so maybe that will change after we get this shit sorted- but- for the meantime, I'm basically on the verge of an adrenaline imbalance at all times and can get realllllly angry for basically nothing.
  
  The questions most likely to trigger that fury are: 1. questions about motherhood/assuming that I'm fertile or a parent- I am not on either count, and it makes me really mad as a feminist when I feel like women are reduced to Maiden, Mother, or Crone roles and disregarded otherwise. Women are more than their opinions on babies or their ability to breed. 2. As with the Maiden, Mother, Crone statement, I also absolutely detest questions about ""virginity"" or any very personal sexual questions. That's no one's business unless we know each other very well or are having a conversation about that specifically- and privately. 3. I hate being asked things that don't have anything to do with my thoughts or opinions on something but instead want me to basically act as google for the asker. I'm not Google.

  Ooof. I haven't even started thinking about gifts yet. We really don't buy them for anyone other than the little kid nephews and niece and sometimes something small for each other but even that gets put aside some years. My concern at Christmas time is always more about sending cards and getting the tree up- past that, I'm like, whatever. I think my oldest nephew wants ninja turtle stuff lately- his soon-to-be-brother needs newborn clothes, and my niece I have no idea, I don't talk to her parents so we'll probably just send whatever I find that looks cute.
  
  Ideally, of course, I'd have tons of money and buy gifts for everyone I care about- and I love to choose things for people- but with my medical bills always and only having one steady income, it just can't happen. If I had a nice house with a big kitchen and room for people to stay, I'd love to host a big Christmas party where people could stay overnight and there would be food and games and time spent together, preferably somewhere with a nice mountain or forest view- maybe I'd cook a big roast, a Virginia ham, and a tofurky with all sorts of sides and desserts. I have no idea what I would want for Christmas gifts for myself. I guess a slanket.

I personally don't like drama on my page, and have blocked people for trying to debate my opinion with me uninvited, but if it was for whatever reason not caught and deleted by me first and a friend jumped in to back up my opinion or whatever for me, I would be okay with that. Usually I let it go, but in rare cases, I just fly in there like a tornado of fists.  *shrug*

  I occasionally make up my own superstitions and then follow those, but that has less to do with reality or belief and more to do with obsessive and compulsive behaviors :P

   💀🎃 Q2: Do you believe you could survive a zombie or nuclear apocalypse? What would you use as a stronghold? Would you carry a weapon or go bare handed?
  ","
  I always joke that I don't run for anything, even zombies- so if they're fast, then I'm in trouble. If there were an apocalyptic event that didn't involve fast zombies, then I think maybe I could. I have no idea what I'd use or how I'd do things, that seems like the sort of situation I'd probably handle best flying by the seat of my pants.

   Happy Halloween! 💀🎃 Q1: Have you ever had your palm read? If not, do you believe in the concept of psychic abilities?
  ","
  I have, unwillingly. A few days back I told about the self-styled shaman who thought I was some sort of prophet or whatever for a while. This wasn't an isolated incident. Beginning in my mid-teens, I have attracted that type of person.. I have nothing AGAINST anyone's faith or religious practices, and that includes the new-agey set, but it's not really something I have much faith in myself. Nowadays, I stay more vigilant about noticing what's going on around me so I can shut down mentally and use body-language to discourage strangers approaching me about odd things but it still happens once in a blue moon.
  
  The palmist story is one of the few that really left a bad taste in my mouth, rather than just leaving me startled or amused like the others.
  
  I saw him a few bars down in Louisville, KY while I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette at a karaoke bar on Bardstown Rd. about 8 years ago. I had recently been diagnosed with ""unexplained infertility"", after spending several years seeing specialist after specialist who couldn't determine what specifically was causing my reproductive system to give me so much trouble. Anyway, a friend of ours' uncle or aunt or someone owned a karaoke bar and I met a friend of mine and her mother out there with Jon to blow off some steam.
  
  He was like, 5'9""-ish, skinny, pale, with INTENSE eyes, longish blonde hair, and glasses. He kept trying to make eye contact, and he skeeved me out so I stubbed out my cigarette and went back in, walking immediately past my friends toward the back of the bar to use the restroom.
  
  When I came back out, he was SITTING AT THE TABLE WITH MY FRIENDS AND HUSBAND. I don't know how he knew who I was with. It was thankfully my turn up, so I sang whatever it was I had picked, and came back to my table. He was still there. He had read my friend and her mom's palms, and they were tipsy and thought it was funny and insisted I let him do mine.
  
  I gave in and handed over my hand kind in a kinda bitchy way. He had definitely crossed WAY too many lines already. he grabbed it and his hand was really cold. he traced a few lines with his finger and I yanked my hand back. He stood up, eyes wide, big dumb fucking smile on his face, and said ""you're gonna have a boy!""
  
  I was seething. I tossed back the rest of my beer, slammed the bottle down, wiped my mouth, stood up calmly while he's just still all elated, looking at me waiting for me to rejoice, and I told him to get the fuck away from me and never fucking come back. I had tears in my eyes. I told Jon we were leaving. His face fell as it dawned on him that I wasn't celebrating and was like ""I didn't say that to be mean, I know you don't think you're going to but you're going to have a boy and that's what's supposed to happen"". I left and it has bugged me since (and yes I'm still child-free)

That leaves me most days with the choice of taking xanax instead and being unable to work because zombie, or just pushing through the waves of panic, which hasn't been easy. I'm not sure why I'm so keyed up, I'm sure it's a combination of a billion things.

  Men need to stand up to other men. All those supposed ""nice guys"" out there need to actually be nice guys and start letting their male friends know that harassment and sexism are unacceptable behaviors, and by setting an example. Our current society's extremely toxic and damaging masculinity teaches boys and men that it's okay to objectify, claim, and harass women, and until the men out there who see how this is very obviously wrong start standing up to their male peers nothing will change.
  
  To the others who answered this who blamed women for having breasts? Don't ever fucking contact me.

   Right sexuality is something which confuses me, I don't like labelling myself purely because I'm not sure what my sexuality is. How do YOU know 100% what your sexuality is? How can a person say for example that they're straight when we never really know who our hearts will fall in love with?
  ","
  I was convinced I was straight until I was 35, despite a lifetime of major and intense crushes on both men and women. So I guess what I'm saying is, it's entirely possible to have no clue what your sexuality is without really going inward and exploring those questions with an open mind. I grew up with an abusive mother who very vocally hated lesbians (she has no problem with gay men just lesbians) and I guess I just internalized that and was afraid of my attraction to women and accepted that I was attracted to men too and that was good enough.

If you mean those purity ring things that dads give their daughters, I think they mean that you're in the Bible Belt.

   TW: Suicide. 
No one understands that I contemplate ending my life at least once a week.
  ","
  I'm sorry to hear that, anon. I do understand what that is like. I know that it's hard to talk about, and I know how sometimes it seems counter-intuitive to expend energy to get help when you don't care about yourself or what happens enough to really want it. I hope you will, though. There are a lot of great things in this world, even if it's hard to see that now.
  
  I recently heard of a service that I really loved the idea of, though I've not personally used it. It's a crisis line that communicates in text messages, for those of us who have anxiety about talking on the phone. If that sounds like something that might help you out, I encourage you to use it, at the very least to find out what options might be available to you locally if you decide to seek medical help for your depression. It's:
  


   http://www.crisistextline.org/get-help-now/
  

  I take Cymbalta (an anti-depressant) and some prescription supplements for depression, and it worked really well for me. I've cycled through tons of different medications to find one that worked, and sadly that is normal but it is worth it. It is such a relief to be able to reconsider things like GOALS again, and have thoughts that aren't centered about how I would kill myself in each current situation. I have also seen therapists in the past. Each of these options- or both together- can really really help control depression, if those are options you can afford and access. The link I posted up their could be a valuable tool for finding low-cost options too, I'm sure, as they are trained to help.
  
  Anyway, this is long.
  
  Thank you for reaching out to me. You made the first and hardest step. Next is reaching out again to someone with the tools to get you started on recovery. I wish you all of the energy, encouragement, motivation, and care you need to make this happen for yourself.

   So since my most recent anon has temporarily prevented me from answering questions (lol), I figure I'll go ahead and ask everyone a few; 👻 1) Does your wardrobe have a general ""theme"" or color palette? How would you describe your taste in clothing?

  I seem to have a lot of grey, red, teal, and black in my wardrobe but it's not really on purpose. My taste in clothing hasn't changed much since the mid-late 90s. Comfortable layers, menswear mixed in with florals, graphic tees and jeans, boots or mary janes or sneakers.

I bribe myself a lot, like ""well if you finish all your sketches for the day you can eat ice cream"" or ""finish folding the laundry and then it's time to smoke up!"" and that works to a degree but not really. Stuff gets done around here but it's not through motivation so much as habit. My current goal is to start sticking to more of a regular schedule, and I'm getting there.

  ","
  I hadn't heard about this until now so if there's some subtler issues I'm not aware of please forgive me but just based on what you've said I think it's always good to see representation of REAL women in fashion ads. Women of all colors and sizes and backgrounds. So it seems great.

  Yes I am, and I think it's because it's an anxiety that has controlled parameters, if that makes sense? It's fear I know will (most likely) end after 2 hours and I turn the lights on. I like all kinds. I have a deep fondness and appreciation for unnecessary gore, like in Evil Dead 2 or Dead Alive. I love a good psychological horror like The Shining. I love monsters, slashers, whatever. The Babadook was pretty good. The first Paranormal Activity messed me up reallllly badly. I like horror novels and stuff too, but I honestly just haven't read many past having that same Stephen King and Anne Rice phase everyone had in the early 90s. I don't read as much as I used to these days.
  
  As far as other ways, not so much. I have ptsd and generalized anxiety among other things and my adrenaline levels do not regulate themselves very well. If I ever ever even once chose ""flight"" instead of ""fight"" in a panic situation, it might be okay, but I am a fighter lol. I can't go to haunted houses because if I get too startled I just start wailin' on shit. I punched an actor in the jaw when I was like 14 and had to be removed.  Practical jokes against me that involve jump scares and surprises may as well be called ""watch Allison fuckshitup.exe"".

I changed my last name to Campbell in 2004. I've been shehitsback most on internet-type things, but have also occasionally used shinobisoup, loglady, dymphna, and owlison.studios.

  I am not going to remember them all, so here are at least the ones that I used most: Pinetree42, Shinobisoup, Shehitsback, Loglady, Dymphna, Owlison.studio, I guess those were the main ones. My favorite (and the one I've used the longest) is shehitsback, which is from the title of a song I was really into during my teens by Yoko Ono. I will probably be using owlison.studio more in the future.

   Have you ever taken a personal day off of work or school, even though you weren't really ""sick""? Do you think jobs and schools should be more understanding of individuals who take days off for mental health concerns, instead of physical health?
  ","
  I've definitely done this, and have lost jobs because of it. Mental health has never really been something that any of my previous employers understood well at the time, with the exception of one shop owner way back when I was in college who was way nicer to me than he should have been because I was a terrible employee lol.  I absolutely believe that mental health days are needed, even for people who don't suffer from major psychological ailments.

  I am working on a game currently, that is a rogue-like adventure game with TCG features. I probably could explain that better but my brain is really garbled tonight, I've got a cold (boo).  The art is mostly a sort of painterly pixel style with the exception of the in-game cards, which are a little more detailed.
  
  When I do art for myself, generally it's either just doodling on my tablet or encaustic painting, which is a painting type that uses pigmented wax and can be easily carved into and molded as well as used as a traditional paint. It's not something I'm especially good at right now but I'm having a good time learning.

Summers are beautiful, Sunny, and mild (generally high in the upper 80s F, lows in the 60s F), and everything is green and ripe and amazing.  Spring and Fall are cool, staying between 50 and 70 F usually, but Fall still holds on to that sun for a while if it can while Spring rains nearly constantly. Winter is cold but not extremely cold, with very little snow (though the mountains are heavily snowed on).  I love the climate here.

  Anyone ""could"" get offended by anything, but in this situation, particularly in America and what has been happening with police brutality/militarization and the extremely high amount of black people being killed by the police, those offended other races can just sit the hell down and get over themselves.

   Do you think you've changed in the last year? In what way?
  ","
  I have changed so much over the last year in so many ways that I don't know where to begin listing.
  
  A year and a half of medication switching brought on about 25 lbs. more than I expected, and for the first time since maybe puberty I've been unfamiliar with my body in some ways- like, I don't translate my size change mentally very well. I feel awkward, and a bit dysphoric. I'm hoping now that I'm on stable medications again, I will be able to lose some of it. Crossing my (swollen) fingers.
  
  The reason for the med changes were that my anti-depressants plateaued and before I had a handle on that, I suffered some traumatic medical news that ended up triggering some psychotic behavior (I have OCD and episodic schizophrenia in addition to my major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as post traumatic stress disorder) anyway it's been a hell of a year for me and my psychiatrist because nothing was working and the side effects were all intense and it was just a nightmare of ups and downs.
  
  During these sorts of psychological events, you end up needing huge amounts of time to just sort of go inward and re-assess who you are. Or at least, I do. During my inward phase, I admitted to myself that the only reason I've never been able to let myself believe that I am attracted to other genders is because my mother's intense hatred for lesbians has had me terrified to disappoint her in yet another way. Even though I tell myself I don't care about her opinions. Even though I've not spoken to her in years. So, that happened. I came out at age 35 as a bisexual.
  
  But right after that, I started having some reoccurring dreams that I've had throughout my life at different stages, in which I dream normal day to day sort of situations for me except I am male. I started really thinking about these and sort of obsessing about and tearing apart my feelings and making comparisons and realized that I really understood where the idea of gender fluidity comes from, because I can see myself at different times relating differently, or on a different ""scale"" to one gender or another throughout my life and I'm comfortable with that. I still feel that I identify as a woman, but I decided to go ahead and change that ""bi"" announcement to ""pansexual"" instead because it felt like a more accurate description of how I newly felt about gender.
  
  Also, my hair looks way better than it did last year. So basically, many changes.

Every time I move and change dentists, I have to explain over again that I'm not interested in braces, I've grown to like my large, crooked teeth.

  I occasionally have these big ideas for painting series that I end up never finishing (and barely beginning) but they always require research, and every time this happens I tell myself I'm going to go back and learn even more about each of these topics past just what I particularly needed for the paintings and then I never do because of either time restraints, loss of interest, or forgetfulness.

  Eh, I'm not really sure what I think about this to be honest.

  I keep a notebook on my desk so that I can jot down things before forgetting them. That sort of acts as the command center. From there, I am a list-maker. I have a running shopping list, and when that list is full enough to warrant a trip to the store, then a new list is made in order of the grocery store layout for a more efficient trip. I'm packing for a trip right now, so I have lists of chores that need to be done before we leave, lists of what to pack, lists of items not to forget, lists of chargers and toiletries and things to pick up from the store tomorrow. I have a white board in the kitchen with a cleaning schedule and a magnet marker that I can move down the list to indicate what day of the week it is (and therefore what chores are due). I'm not always the best at keeping up with everything, but it is all fairly organized.

  It's important for children to have the vocabulary for their own anatomy, and to not feel uncomfortable speaking about it to their caregivers.  I think it's perfectly fine to have funny names for things or whatever, my nephew misheard my sister's lesson on anatomy as a toddler and thought his nipples were ""meatballs"" for a while, which was adorable... however, a kid needs to be able to communicate clearly and with seriousness what their body concerns are whether that's to a doctor or a parent or whatever.

  I do not. I've been in a monogamous relationship for a dozen years though, so I mean, it can be done. For some, it's enough and they have a partner who provides every single one of their needs and who they provide every need for. For the average human, I think we rely more on small self-made communities to fill out needs whether that's through friendship or flirtations or professional relationships or whatever. I don't see anything wrong with that. I know that with my illnesses, I am often a poor partner and I have asked my husband to please find someone to be close to for his sake and for mine, so I could feel like the guy I love is being fully cared for, but he's not really comfortable with that idea at this time.

  ","
  I've been having a hard time coming up with an answer for this because I guess at this stage of my life I'm just not very romantic- but then I remembered our hamster Kostya.
  
  About 6 years ago, I found a hamster running away from a feral cat near the apartment dumpster and took him in. I had 3 cats at the time, so I just kept a watch on things and kept his cage in a very secure place.
  
  After a while, I noticed that during ""ball time"" where I let him run around the living room in his plastic ball while Jon and I sat on the sofa, he would go look for my cat Rin every single time.
  
  I started paying more attention and apparently Rin and Kostya had a really close bond. She checked up on him frequently, kept the other cats away, liked to ""cuddle"" while he was in his ball, it was adorable
  
  Then, as hamsters do, he died. He died in my hands, we had no idea how old he was when we found him but his teeth were very long, so I'm sure it was just the end. He was wheezing and pooping and as I held him and cleaned him he just stopped being alive.
  
  Rin mourned for months. Slept curled up in the exact place his cage had been. Perked up and investigated anything that still had a lingering smell of him. It was heartbreaking. Rin really really loved that hamster.

  Hi Leigh :) I'm skipping 1 and 2 this time (not reading anything currently; infertile), but lemme take a shot at 3 here.
  
  I'm not sure what a fulfilled life entails, or even where the lines would be drawn on material things if it was attainable. I would assume free-time is the most important part of having a fulfilled life, so the bare minimum amount of things I could handle and still feel like my entire life wasn't dedicated to chores and drudgery would be: running water/modern plumbing, modern kitchen options (stove, microwave, fridge, freezer,  coffee maker, dishes/flatware/glassware/cookware seem like ones I would be frustrated to be without), internet access and a way to access it, and of course an adequate amount of food, proper shelter, a place to rest, and basic toiletries.
  
  I guess then the extras I feel are fundamental to my lifestyle would be convenience foods, decent computer set up and fast internet, tools for art, small appliances (electric griddle, toaster, crock pot), specialty skin care products and make up and things like that rather than the basics, and decorative and comfort items for my home. I'm sure I'm missing a lot.

The most recent series I've read was a fantasy trilogy that was really good. It's not like, new or anything, but I think it came out in the 90s- anyway the first in the series is Sabriel, I can't remember the offical trilogy name.

Now it's just like - oh shit, we've gotta move for my husband's job in two weeks, time to get rolling. I use apartment listings online, then check google for neighborhood statistics, then check for reviews on apartmentratings.com.

Some people are able to see the bigger picture and make choices based on the good of all better than others. Some people have more specialized knowledge than others.

   Q2: What do you believe defines intelligence? Are there different types of intelligence? What kind of intelligence do you possess?

  Intelligence is defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. I agree with the standard definition but might add that it's the ability to solve problems with the tools you have. I don't know that I'd say there are different types of intelligence. Maybe different kinds of ways to be smart about things. Some people are smart in a ""has collected a ton of knowledge and applies that to their lives"" way, some people are smart in a ""used logic and creativity to survive"" way, etc.
  
  I don't know what I possess, really. The reason I was studied as a kid was because my IQ was high but my problem solving didn't follow the same patterns as other people with similarly high IQs. When I was 19, I had multiple psychotic manifestations present themselves, which made problem solving more difficult because panic was introduced in many cases. I don't feel intelligent most of the time. I feel lost.

However, IQ lowers over time, and I've had plenty of time pass since first grade lol. The internet tests I've taken have varied wildly numerically but still placed me in a ""super genius"" or ""genius"" range.

  My favorite book is Demian by Hermann Hesse, and in the middle part of the book, the lead character meets a young musician and philosopher named Pistorius who teaches him that ""every man's true calling is only to arrive at himself"". I consider that a lot, especially lately as I've been struggling back up from a fall into the pit of trauma memories, depression, and anxiety-fueled issues. You learn so much about yourself in those sorts of situations, sometimes it's even quite shocking. Arriving at the doorstep of Who You Really Are and being comfortable with who you see when the door opens is something a lot of people shy away from doing or are unable to do, but it's what we're meant to do. Or something. I am so tired right now.

Music is more of a personal enjoyment thing, and I've always connected certain times of my life with certain mixes of bands. I don't know that I could pick one most meaningful musician. I don't think I could even pick one musician per life stage that was more meaningful than others. It's about emotion and mood and memory and it's more of a living playlist that is my ""favorite"" rather than any one part of that.

Like, I won a trip to Lake Tahoe last Winter, and we had an amazing time but I would never have considered Tahoe a place I especially wanted to visit prior to that. We wanted to see more of the US, and when my husband relocated from VA to WA, we got to drive from ocean to ocean practically and see a huge chunk of states. My husband won a week in Vegas once, and though we don't really drink or gamble we had a great time. Travel just sort of happens for us. We only really plan local-ish things, day trips and the like. I suppose part of me wants to go to Brazil because of some family history, and England, but not so much that I'd say it's something I consider extremely meaningful.

  I was so lucky in the teacher lottery. I can't think of a single one that made the most impact because so many did, and in positive ways (I did have one especially shitty one, but boo on her). My first grade teacher Mrs. Smith fought to get me into the gifted program because even though my IQ is wayyyyy up there my mother was a hard sell on anything that meant she might have to put more effort in as a parental figure. Because of Mrs. Smith, I was able to get an education more catered to my abilities. From there, I had mostly good teachers, a few stand-outs (Mrs. Sutton was a science teacher in middle school, Mrs. French was a liberal arts teacher in 6th grade), until high school when I began attending governor's school for the arts, and spend the next 4 years with a group of amazing teachers with three particularly who really saw into me and had hearts big enough to offer me the support and structure I desperately needed (Virginia Van Horn, Peter Thurston, Jon Petruchyk). From there, it was college, with another two teachers who really went the distance (Thorpe Feidt and Jen Hilton). I kept in touch sporadically with Thorpe,a few years with Peter and Jen, but not in ages- Jon sadly has passed, I'm friends with Virginia on facebook in the same aquaintance-y way I am with a lot of other people I wish I had stayed more ""in-touch"" with.  However, they all were so important to me at the times they were in my life, and I owe a lot to each of them.

  ","
  As someone who depends very heavily on medications in order to live a relatively ""normal"" life, I can be pretty pro-medication. HOWEVER. I've also spent years trying to find the right medication combinations to treat my illnesses (and am still trying to sort out a good anti-anxiety) so I'm well aware how scary and over-the-top some of the pills and side effects can be. Not every prescription medication is created equal, and many can be quite dangerous. Does that negate their necessity? Nah. It just sucks that there's such a wide variance of things that can go wrong when you really need something to go right. As for pharmaceutical companies, I think it really depends on the doctor/hospital. When I lived on the East coast, I felt like more of my doctors were just throwing whatever cool new pill they were being sold on by reps that day at me, and it really sucked. I don't know if I just had particularly shitty doctors, or if they were just overworked, or what. Since moving here, I've noticed that my doctors have really been very good about staying up to date on research and a more holistic approach (i.e.- ""this pill might help, but it will aggravate this other ailment, so it's not going to be a good match"" instead of just prescribing whatever without worrying about how it'll affect everything else) so I don't feel like pill companies have as much of an influence here.

My mom and her brother and parents lived in Brazil for a decade before moving back to the states, and my stepmother lived in Japan as a child so I feel like I've been raised with at least some global awareness which maybe would be more pronounced if I grew up somewhere other than America.

   Q#2: Do you have any interest in the United States 2016 Presidential Election? If so, what are your views on the current candidates? Whose political perspectives do you agree with the most? (Ignore if you don't know, I won't be offended.)
  ","
  I don't normally care too much about presidential elections, to be honest. I always vote, and I generally like one candidate more than the others, but I've never registered as a party member or anything. I do like Bernie Sanders though. Recently I received a survey in the mail from the Democratic party and I filled out the bits about my thoughts on certain platform issues, but I left the ones about my personal involvement with the party blank because I've never identified as a Dem and haven't voted for a Democratic president I don't think ever. I did write across the top in bold though that although I don't care for the party, I really liked Bernie so yay.

   Hello everyone! Sorry for the small hiatus, I've been busy lately. Q#1: Do you believe that if you lie to yourself enough times, you'll eventually believe it? Or do you believe that the truth will always be lurking in the back of your mind?
  ","
  I have to be very careful about questioning my truths and making sure that I am not lying to myself or falling into a delusional cycle pretty vigilantly because of my tendency to fall into schizoaffective behaviors in times of depression and anxiety. It's a weakness that many have abused me with- it's super easy to gaslight someone and diminish their self-worth when they already question literally everything.

  I feel like I don't really watch a lot of tv compared to most people, and yet I had like, a dozen immediate responses fly into mind when I read this question. I guess I'm more of a tv junky than I thought. My all-time favorite shows are Twin Peaks, M*A*S*H, the Muppet Show, Nip/Tuck, Northern Exposure, X-files.

  So the man walks over and introduces himself and offers to buy a round. The guy with the big orange head says, ""Yeah, I'll bet you want to know the story, huh?"" To which the man replies, ""Sure, if you don't mind.""
  
  The man with the big orange head sighs and says, ""You know, I've gone over it in my mind a million times. Basically, it's like this: I was walking along the beach one day, when I stubbed my toe on something. I looked down, and there was an antique brass lamp. I picked it up and dusted it off a little -- when all of a sudden this enormous genie pops out!
  
  ""The genie thundered, 'You have released me from my ten-thousand year imprisonment, and I am in your debt. I will grant you three wishes as a token of my gratitude.'
  
  The man at the bar is agape. The guy with the big orange head continues: ""So I said, 'Wow, okay. Well, my first wish is to be fantastically wealthy.'
  
  ""The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And all of a sudden I have rings on my fingers and a crown on my head, and my wallet is full of money and a dozen ATM cards and the deed to a mansion in the hills -- I mean, I was loaded!
  
  ""So I said, 'Amazing! Okay, for my next wish , I want to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world.'
  
  ""The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And the ocean parts, and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress, and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there. It was incredible.
  
  ""The genie booms, 'You have one wish remaining.'""
  
  The man with the big orange head pauses and sips his beer. He says, ""Now, you know, this may be where I went wrong. I wished for a big orange head.

    http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/astro/natal
   
","
  My mother is vehemently atheist, yet believes very strongly in astrology... so that's what I was raised with instead of any formal religious upbringing. When you die, there's nothing, and God isn't real...but you're a Capricorn, so if you don't get straight A's you're getting your ass beat. My two only tattoos are from when I was 18, and I had my astrology signs done. I have rejected all of that in the years since, but it's still hard to not check my horoscope sometimes just for a bit of comfort, I guess.
  
  For this particular natal chart interpretation, I'm going to read through and put the traits it mentions in ""true"" and ""not true"" categories:
  
  TRUE: want to feel useful and effective, realistic, lonely, reserved, resourceful, strong sense of responsibility, deadpan humor, dependable, loyal, quiet, strong-willed, doesn't take orders well, highly intelligent, fair, offended by rage, trustworthy, open-minded, depressed, emotionally intense, able to ""cut right to the core"" of a person, afraid of betrayal, powerful, trouble letting go, instinctual, authoritative, sincere, careless with money
  
  NOT TRUE: attracted to status symbols, cautious/ sure-footed, does not show emotion, unimaginative, strong sense of tradition, hard-working, social, physically fit, patient, easily embraces change, self-harming, professional-goal driven, controlled, good public speaker, energetic, impulsive, has lots of children

My sister does- if she can spin something to be a positive thing, or convince herself that there's a sunny side, she'll do it, and she seems mostly happy except in spurts when it builds up too much so it must work for her. For me personally it's always been easier to just be open. It might scare some people away or make some people uncomfortable but at the same time it clears out those without empathy or kindness in them quickly so the people I DO end up spending time with are generally good, understanding people who aren't going to get grossed out when I'm ugly crying because something triggered me on a bad day.

   What do you wish more people understood about OCD?
  ","
  Thank you for asking, Lydia, because this is certainly one of the many mental health disorders that people like to make light of and I hope it's just ignorance and not purposeful ableism.
  
  The main thing I wish more people understood is that there are many many different possible types of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. There are 4 type names that try to act as an umbrella over all of the possible manifestations of OCD, but they don't catch all of them. Those 4 types are:  Checking, Hoarding, Ruminating, and Contamination.
  
  Most people are somewhat familiar with Hoarding type OCD because of tv or whatever.
  
  Contamination type is another OCD type that most people have at least a vague understanding of. This type covers OCD behaviors like hand-washing, organization, extreme fears of germs, fear of public toliets, refusal to participate in hand-shaking, fear of touching door knobs with bare hands, etc. Something most people are not aware of is that this can also mean Mental Contamination, where the person with OCD feels contaminated for less obvious reasons. This could be because of abuse or molestation, breaking rules of strict religious beliefs, etc. where the person feels defective or unclean and continuously tries to find ways to physically clean off the emotional contamination.
  
  Checking OCD covers things like compulsively checking locks, knobs, alarms, stove tops, lights, safety checks etc. but it can also mean checking relationship statuses compulsively (are you mad at me? Do you still love me? etc) checking on the safety of loved ones, checking information you've read over and over because of fear that you won't remember, checking and double checking memories or past stories to make sure they are ""real"", and infinite other possibilities involving doubting your ability to do something correctly whether it's keeping your home protected or being a good spouse or whatever else.
  
  Rumination OCD is also sometimes called ""Intrusive Thought"" OCD. Rumination OCD leaves a person obsessing over a specific train of thought. That thought could be literally anything- bad things happening to the people you love- specific times in history- theological questions- superstitious beliefs- etc. Some examples would be: being afraid to interact with children because you're afraid you'll accidentally injure them, Constantly tallying your sins and worrying that you'll never be good enough in God's eyes, Believing that stepping on cracks in a sidewalk will literally hurt your mother and worrying over any you accidentally step on for long periods of time, Being absolutely convinced that your partner is cheating on you with no proof and letting it run your life.
  
  Most people with OCD suffer from several different manifestations, and that can change over time. Some people with OCD can remain symptom-free for long periods of time, and have them triggered again by depression or anxiety or for no reason at all. I'm running out of characters so that'll have to do :)

   Lately, I've seen a lot of controversy concerning the stigma of body hair. What is your opinion on women with body hair (specifically armpit or leg hair)? Do you agree or disagree with society's expectation of women to shave? What is your personal preference (if you're comfortable sharing)?
  ","
  My opinion is that people should do wtf they want to with their own bodies, though I do think it's considerate to stay clean and hygienic if you're going to be intimate with someone.  I have nothing against body hair on another person. I remember feeling shamed when a partner suggested I shave everything ""down there"" a million years ago. I find I disagree with most any of society's expectations if they have to do with a person's individual choice on a private and petty matter like how to groom body hair. I personally shave pits, legs, and genitals, pluck my eyebrows and a couple of chin hairs, and use a depilatory cream on my upper lip but it's less for appearance and more because I have OCD and that often (for me) manifests in compulsive skin picking and it's way worse if I feel certain textures of hair along skin areas I expect to be smooth.

   Do you ever feel like there's no point at all in living another day?  If so, how do you get out from under that?
  ","
  Often. Drugs. Prescription drugs. It takes a very delicate balance to keep me from the darker sides of my depression. I take a SNRI, thyroid hormones, prescription-level folic acid (if I were to buy drugstore folic acid as a replacement, I'd be going through about a bottle of pills a day), and I smoke marijuana daily. I'm in regular contact with my team of doctors. Right now, this is what it takes to fight off the depression enough that I can rationalize through my issues and survive it. I'm working on finding the right balance for the anxiety now.
  
  Here's the thing though. I've tried half a dozen-ish times. To end it. Twice, I came really fucking close. I remember those times. There wasn't a peaceful feeling and my loved ones in the light. There was the soul-crushing feeling that everything was wrong and I had to get back. There was emotional pain that I can't even describe. It felt like I was ripping my spiritual body apart trying to cling to the physical because on every level of existence, I had made a mistake. Maybe that's just my own brain's chemical reaction to death. But I've talked to a few people who've experienced the same. We're not meant to go that way.

  I've stayed friendly with probably half of my exes, though I don't talk to most very often nowadays. There are two of those I'm closer to, one who I talk to on facebook a couple of times a month and one who I hear from maybe once a week or so. I don't see any of them regularly now because I've moved across the country from where I grew up and lived most of my life, but when I was back East it wasn't unusual for my husband and I to have dinner with one of my exes and their date here and there as friends.
  
  I would prefer all of my relationships have worked out this way (minus one person) but sometimes things just aren't salvageable. I have a lot of faith in the concept of ""soul groups"" and reincarnation, to a degree, though it's not something I like to talk about here. I will say that when I feel a very strong connection to someone I do try my best to keep that connection open in some way even after romantic feelings subside or change.

  6 inches is longer than the National average. If girls are laughing at you then they're not mature enough for sex or they're laughing about something else.

I think- and I'm not in any way connected to or a part of the tattoo/body mod community or anything, so I am just talking from my perceptions here- that there's been a pretty steady change since the early aughts away from impulse tattoos in any old shop on the ""bad side of town"" while drinking with your buddies to a more refined experience overall. Potential clients are more likely to research not only the shop but the artist they'll be working with, and build a relationship with them over each piece. I mean, I'm sure there are still regrettable tattoos being had at sketchy places, but overall it seems like it's become definitely more of a creative and well-planned process.

  All my days are ""days off"" but I do try to balance work and relaxation to a degree at home. I get to mess around on the internet while I wake up and take my pills/drink my coffee, then I try to get as many chores done as I'm able and shower. From there I relax a bit with whatever, sometimes that's a nap, sometimes that's reading twitter, sometimes that's sitting on my sofa watching the birds at my feeders. When Jon (and our car) get home, I need to be ready to go for any errands that need to be run, and then it's dinner. The rest of my night is generally mostly goofing off with some creative work mixed in.

If I were able to get a house, I'd REALLY like to plant a big garden of herbs and flowers that can be distilled down for essential oils to sell/use (rosemary, basil, peppermint, spearmint, chamomile, lavender). If I have enough land/yard, I'd like to grow extra chamomile because there's a small but steady market for dried flowers around here for the tea companies using it in herbal blends. I'd like to make soap to sell at farmers markets and to use. I'd like to keep 2 bee hives.
  
  I'd like to make games with my friend. I'd like to have the motivation to learn to code so I could take on a little bit of work through that.

   Question #1: Do you play video games? If so, what's your favorite console/game?
  ","
  I play tons of games! I almost never use a console, though, except for my Nintendo 2DS. I'm pretty strictly a computer gamer, preferring to get my games from places like steam or itch.io or whatever. I LOVE small indie games that are presented in an artsy way, and I also love big immersive AAAs (just haven't invested much time in any lately, but that's going to change soon cause I have Fallout 3 ready to go) Lately I've been playing H1Z1 which is a zombie shooter survival game but I'm going to spend an evening on Dear Esther here soon before moving into Fallout 3. My favorite games of my childhood were the Atari games Yars Revenge and Carnival, and Shadowgate and Mario bros. on NES. I didn't play many games between NES and later consoles but my roommates in college had a SNES and my neighbors had a gamecube and a dreamcast so I did play things here and there.  My adult favorte game is harder to choose because I really just love so many games. My favorites I've played in the past year or so have been Kentucky Route Zero, Nuclear Throne, Binding of Isaac, Minecraft, any of the Elder Scrolls except ESO, Alice: Madness Returns,  The Wolf Among Us, and GOTY 420 Blaze It.

   Who are you?  Who is Allison?
  ","
  I'm re-answering more seriously, though the first answer of ""hell if I know"" is also pretty accurate.
  
  I'm in a place where I'm just now figuring out a lot about myself, and it's been a hard road to this point. The constants are: I'm smart, anxious, depressed. I'm a big fan of art, music, games, food, design, and a bushel of other dumb shit. I had a bad childhood and strings of terrible luck in both health and relationships throughout my younger years. My health continues to suck. I wanted to be an artist when I grew up. I didn't think I'd ever actually grow up. Adulthood has been a series of long stretches of pretending I've known what I was doing speckled with  times where mental illness held me down in one way or another. Everything else seems to change, at least has changed, or is changing? I don't know. Today is hard.
  
  I'm a person who has made many significant connections with people in my life but who has to medicate in order to spend any time with them in real life. I like to think I've helped a lot of people and made a difference but I still feel very lonely often. I believe in nonsense and pray to a vague non-formed idea. Loud noises trigger panic attacks. I used to sleepwalk into the ocean. I spent 35 years suppressing bisexual thoughts because of what my mother might say. I have crushes on women now and it's bizarre and wonderful.
  
  I'm a lot to deal with and I have more emotional baggage than water has wet. I have a neutral American accent that can switch to Appalachian or New England for certain words or phrases. I pick at my skin. I like to be quiet for long periods of time and require alone/down time.
  
  Um
  
  I'm an INFJ. and a Capricorn. I guess. That's as good as I can do right now.

  The ""whatever society thinks is healthy"" lifestyle has always been trendy. Whether that's wearing a nosegay of violets to ward off the plague or swallowing x amount of castor oil every night or pulling on your yoga pants and drinking a green juice on the way to spin class.  Those with enough privilege to afford these trends get to feel superior to those of us who are not because they can fend off those thoughts of mortality a little bit easier.

   Final question for the night! Question #3: If given the opportunity, would you want to see the names of those who follow you? Or would you rather it stay anonymous? What may be the pros and cons of this?
  ","
  When I'm in a blockin' mood or being harassed by an anon, then hell yeah I really wish I could find out who it is....at first. But really, I do like the anonymity. It gives people a chance to interact with someone without any expectations about who they are? Or something. I like to be able to ask things anonymously as we've discussed here recently. I don't really want to know who follows me. I might be really disappointed that it's three people and a dozen spambots.

  Yes.
  
  Two years ago, they found a mass in my right breast. After two years of monitoring, it was recently classed down to a category 2 BI-RAD grade, which is ""benign finding"". At Category 3, I requested an MRI, just to have an additional image to refer to. This was back in September, I think. The MRI showed three previously unnoticed tumors, the largest having an undefined edge, and residing in my LEFT breast which we hadn't even been monitoring for a year. I had a biopsy in early Nov. and it was declared they were benign fibroademas. I went in for an ultrasound 2 weeks ago, and two of the three are smaller now! So it's not really as much of a threat now, but it was a hard 2 years.
  
  There wasn't a day between the initial mammogram and my recent 6-month follow up that I wasn't thinking in the back of my mind ""I'm probably going to die of cancer before I'm 40."" or something similar. By the time I got to the MRI results, I had a full on mental break that I""m still recovering from.
  
  I still think about death a lot. Probably as much as anyone else. Not as much as I did for a while. I wish I wasn't afraid, but meh.

   Do you agree that cheating (in terms of a romantic relationship) doesn't necessarily require physical contact or explicit intent?
  ","
  I have a hard time with the concept of cheating. I've been in a monogamous relationship for 12 years, and I'm being completely honest when I say that I wish my husband flirted with other people or maybe even more. I think his self esteem would benefit and I think he'd be happier because there are just some things that, after 12 years together, don't click like they once did and I respect and love him enough to still want what's best.  I think, at my core, I'm polyamorous, and also, I often feel like ""cheating"" is sort of a patriarchal thing that just doesn't hold a lot of weight in my heart anymore? Like, I am married, but I don't belong to anyone but myself? I dunno. We talk about these things. If he were okay with it, I would probably date other people. I would definitely like to see him branch out. He's not comfortable with that at this time. I respect that. I dunno.

   What have been the least helpful things people have said about your health? What have been the most helpful things people have said when they find out about your medical problems?
  ","
  People who insist that medication for mental illnesses are unnecessary or dangerous are at the top of my list for ""most unhelpful/ignorant about health"" award.  I need my medications to stay chemically balanced. Without them, I am suicidal and unable to take care of myself or others, I obsess over things to a point of being unable to get past them to live my daily life, and my anxiety reaches levels that cause major physical health concerns.
  
  Second on that list are people who insist that I'm too young to have the medical conditions I do. Yeah, most women don't have to have mammograms until they are 40, but I have had 6 and I'm 35. My age doesn't matter to the three tumors, category 2 mass, and countless cysts making their home in my breasts that need monitoring. Telling me I'm too young doesn't make the problems go away. Yes, most women don't need to worry about brittle bones until after menopause, but osteomalacia affects many younger adults. Telling me I'm not old enough just serves to make me feel even more broken and fragile. The only major health concern of mine currently that I never get told I'm too young for is having Sacro-Iliac Joint Dysfunction, because I guess anyone of any age can mess up their back.
  
  What is helpful is not making a big deal out of things. I look ""normal"". I do ""normal"" things. I have ""normal"" emotions and reactions. Not feeling like some bizarro monster because of my medical shortcomings is pretty important to my overall health. If we are close, letting me know that I have support or that nothing changes between us even on bad days is also welcome.

  ","
  Firstly, I'm not sure what her age is, but if she's a minor then talk to your guardian. That's the number one thing you need to do so that they can take action to help protect her. If she's an adult, and especially if she lives with the boyfriend and is being abused, then it's a bit tougher. Try not to get frustrated with her unwillingness to talk or her insistence that she doesn't need any help, it's possible that she is afraid that it's her fault, that she deserves the abuse, that she'll be killed or hurt worse if anyone finds out, or any number of other fear and trauma-induced reasoning that might not seem logical to YOU but it's how she's surviving. What you CAN do is let her know that you want to help her in ANY way you can, and that she is important and loved and has other options. If you have a family and friends that are close who also have concerns or have voiced the opinion that they fear that she is being abused, then maybe some sort of intervention focusing on how she has a support net to catch her no matter what could be a good idea? But really, I don't know what to tell you. I've been in her situation but I had no help or support so I know how important that can be. Start keeping notes on what you notice as far as bruises, strange behavior, illegal activity on his part, etc. Anything that could be helpful in a case against him if it comes to that. Sadly and disgustingly, the police won't do shit for just bruises. They'll want extremely clear and incriminating proof of abuse...hospitalization, video of him hurting her, eye-witnesses, etc. Good luck, sorry I'm not the best help in the world, I'm certainly no expert on this or anyone who can do much for you :(

  I've touched on it before, but my childhood was not that great. I was the oldest child of a narcissistic mother, who was the product of an abusive childhood as the oldest child of a narcissistic father. I served the role of ""Golden (grand)Child"" to my grandfather, while being the hated ""scapegoat"" to my mother. I learned to read at age 3 and was really advanced as a kid, even as far as being part of some weird top secret IQ study in 1st and 2nd grade and then going to a specialized academically gifted school from 2nd to 4th grade (I switched to an art school in 4th grade). BUT- while technically I'm a super genius or whatever, it's in areas that people don't normally score as high during testing? Like, I'm super smart in things like spatial reasoning but will fail horribly if you put an advanced math equation in front of me. So I've always felt kind of ""dumb"" because while I was still smart by most standards, I wasn't what my mother and grandfather expected me to be. From him, I felt like I constantly let him down. When he was let down, I received extra abuse from my mother, who was always ready to cut me down as much as possible anyway because I look like my dad and not her. This taught me to never be proud of my accomplishments UNLESS I had my grandfather's approval and therefore, my mother's acceptance. It's honestly taken years and years of my adult life trying to reverse that. I try to let myself feel proud of small things, even- cooking a decent meal, getting my chores done before the afternoon is finished, etc- just to try to make up for all of the times I put my all into something as a kid and it wasn't enough.

If I believe God is a vague collection of strange energies that may or may not influence us in any way then God is a vague collection of strange energies that may or may not influence us in any way.  I believe in God in that I believe that many of us need rituals and codes and a feeling of connection.

  I am regularly blown away by how beautiful everything in the Pacific NW is. WA, OR, and Northern CA are astonishingly gorgeous. The wild cold Pacific, the deserts, the forests and rain forests, the snow-capped volcanoes, the ferns and moss and wildlife- this is really the prettiest place I've ever lived. Here's a photo I took in Wenatchee National Forest, WA. The creek is called Devil's Creek. I pulled over to the side of a road to take this like two years ago.

  An empty early morning ocean beach or deep in the woods.  When I lived in Virginia Beach I would wake up at 5am a few times a week during the Summer and drive down to Sandbridge beach before the parking attendant got there (free parking yay) and watch the sunrise. I'd sort of snooze for an hour and then take a swim and then go home. It was peaceful. I was usually the only person around other than morning joggers.  I don't live close enough to the ocean for that sort of thing anymore, and the Pacific is much colder than the jet-streamed Atlantic. Now, I enjoy being in the woods, just walking and being quiet.

I generally wear a silver and labradorite cabochon ring unless I'm dressing up for a particular reason and it doesn't fit in. I have a few other rings I switch in and out occasionally but not lately. I used to always wear a little silver necklace with an abstract owl charm on it but lately my skin has felt to sensitive to deal with it.

  ","
  Sex education is extremely important, and the right age is, I dunno, like 2 years before puberty even thinks about beginning? Kids need to know what's going on with their bodies. Early sex ed should probably focus on anatomy and what changes to expect. I feel like by the time they're late- pre-teens, like 12, they should have a clear understanding of what STDs are and how serious some can be, should already understand how and why their bodies work, how a baby is made, and what contraceptives are available.

  ","
  It's strange, because I was raised in a predominantly atheist household with a bit of woo-woo astrology weirdness thrown in, so the concept of heaven and hell and that sort of afterlife belief was really foreign to me. My family did not believe in any sort of afterlife at all, and that always gave me some degree of anxiety so I avoided really thinking about it for a good portion of my life. I guess, if I have to pinpoint what I believe, it's probably more along the lines of reincarnation, except without the Nirvana/Heaven-like end goal. Just maybe information and energy passed on somehow. I identify as ""agnostic"" mainly because I really don't have any clear answers about what I really believe, I just feel sort of gut-feeling-led on these things whether that's for my own comfort or whether that's my personal truth or what.

I may be totally wrong, but didn't the victims all have some sort of crime they got away with and were paying for from this vigilante psychopath with a puppet?

I'm watching a friend stream H1Z1 right now but I don't think I'd necessarily enjoy that one. The next game I want to play is Fallout 3. I skipped a lot of the consoles most gamers grew up with because of a busy high school and college life, but I grew up with Atari (favorite game Yars Revenge) and NES (Shadowgate was my favorite NES, and of course Mario) After college I messed around with some console games but really it's been mostly PC games since then.

  I was lucky enough to have two mentors, one in high school and one in college. Both were male. Both were MUCH older. Both were artists. Both were good enough to keep the relationship between us as mentor/student until I left the schools they were associated with. Both then took a bizarre turn. The first sent me love letters with gifts and jewelry beginning several years after I graduated, but since he sent them to my mother's address and not my college address she of course read and kept them, and freaked the fuck out (I probably would have to to be honest, but I still hate that she read my shit). The second was less creepy and more of just a straight-forward explanation that he divorced his wife (who was one of many wives) because she wasn't cool with his sex addiction, and now that we were peers I should come by and visit. I declined and we just never really talked anymore.
  
  On a positive note, both gave me several years of learning that I was lucky to have. Both gave me confidence and strength and made me feel supported in my endeavors, which is something my mother never did.

   are you very selective about which books you start though do you think that factors into your overwhelming tendency to finish them?
  ","
  I don't think I'm especially selective, but then again I guess most of the books I've read have been recommended in one way or another either by someone I know saying ""hey you should read this"" or someone I respect listing their favorites or something else. So maybe that is the case. But then again, someone recommended Catch 22 to me, so.... shrug.

  ","
  If it's non-fiction, I don't feel bad about only reading parts, but as far as fiction goes I will almost always finish the book. The ONE exception to this- out of the hundreds of books I've read- was Catch 22 by Joseph Heller. I know several people who say this is their all-time favorite book and I cannot understand how. I found it soooooo boring and hard to lose myself in because of the way it's narrated. Don't think I even made it halfway.

  I really try to be polite and kind as much as possible, but I also have some social anxiety so occasionally it comes across weird or my timing is stupid....but as far as a specific example, I took public transit into Portland yesterday with my husband, and on one of the trains a young homeless couple got on and sat across from us carrying all of their clothes and everything in their arms. I didn't have any cash or food or anything but I remembered I did have one of those nylon bags from Ikea that fold up and expand out to a large shopper bag in my purse so I tried to give it to the girl to carry some of the clothes in but she seemed really embarrassed and turned it down then I was embarrassed but nah, it was intended to be kind gesture and it was her right to do whatever so it's all good.

  So much that my biology lab partner spread a rumor that I was a vampire because I was pale, had goth friends, and slept during the day. Through all of high school, though, I was also attending a second high school that was focused on fine arts, so I'd have to go to regular hs in the mornings, rush to catch a bus downtown, take college art courses until like 5pm, and then bus home. That meant two schools worth of homework, and I was also working 30 hours a week once I turned 16, so I NEEDED those school naps.

  ...and I wish I felt well enough to focus on games more. But whatevs- it's honestly strange to me that my twitter persona is expected to be like, all games all the time by most of you. I started to make games with a friend, but several really terrible things happened and kinda fucked us both over and that's not happening now. I play games, I grew up with games, and I love games- and I have literally been doing so since most of my followers were even born. So- yeah, I will post about games sometimes, and I follow a lot of game makers or other people in the industry- but I also follow a lot of local government tweeters and pro-cannabis tweeters and people I know irl, and just random other shit, and none of those other facets of my twitter life ever reach out and say ""I wish you would tweet about smoking pot more"" or whatever, you know? But if I don't tweet about games, I hemorrhage followers. It's strange. I'll try, just because I DO care about gaming but I mean, give me a break. I just started thyroid meds and my world is kind of shaky and sweaty and nauseous and I'm not really feeling most things right now.

  Strangely enough, I'm old enough to have actually been to a psychologist who was still using something as weird and out-dated as scream therapy when I was a young adult.

He also specialized in dream interpretation and hypnotherapy but for some bizarre reason he was one of very few therapists in my area at the time who was accepted by my insurance.

I overcame the guilt, and I did it. It's been a few years, and things get through here and there of course but it's opened up the space in my life for healing and I am very thankful for that advice and push.

   “إنني أكبر وأميل إلى الصمت أكثر فأكثر، صارت تمرضني فكرة الكلام كلها، لم يكن الكلام سلواي في يوم من الأيام، وقد عرفت مبكرة أن بإمكاني أن أحيا أيامًا طويلة دون أن أقول شيئًا، ودون أن أشعر بأن شيئًا ما ينقصني، إن الصمت نعمة هائلة مسلوبة منَّا.
   
   أحيانًا عندما أستيقظ من النوم ثم أطفئ المكيف أغمض عينيّ وأستسلم لصمت غرفتي، وأشعر كما لو كنت لم أعِ بعد، أشعر كما لو كنت أسبح في محيط من عماء أبدي، حيث لا شيء يرف حولي غير الماء ومن فوقه العرش.
   
   أفكر في أننا نولد من الصمت ونؤول إلى صمت لكننا لا نفهم إلا متأخرين أن ضجيجنا وصخبنا ليس أكثر من رفة جناحٍ عابرة، وأنا ما عادت تغريني رفة الجناح!
   
   ما عدت أريد غير الصمت، الصمت الذي ربضت في كنفه الخليقة دهورًا قبل أن يخلق الله آدم وحواء، الصمت الذي تسبح فيه دون قلق كل الأرواح التي انعتقت من قيد أجسادها فغدت خفيفة لينة غير عابئة بأن تُرى أو تُجرح أو تمرض أو تعذب أو تحترق أو تهان، تمضي حرة موقنة بأنها لم تعد قابلة لأن تُمس! ولم يعد ثمَّ ما يجعلها عرضة للألم.تلاشى الجسد وانطلقت هي إلى صمتها القديم، إلى جنةٍ غادرتها وتعذبت طويلاً قبل أن تعود إليها”

   لا اقتباس ينصفه ولا نص يكفي للحديث عنه
   
   هو الوحيد الذي عندما اخترت الهروب من كل شيء استطاع الوصول اليّ ، مالت بي الدنيا فحملني بكلتا يديه بعيداً نحو السلام، همّي على كتفه ان سألني كيف الحال ولم اكن بخير ، كان يسمع كلماتي أثناء صمتي، وكنت اختياره الأول دوماً ، يثبت لي دائماً انني أولى أولوياته.... في الواحدة ظهراً والأغراض الثقال على ظهره كان يحادثني، باستطاعته ان يجعلني انتظر لكنه لم يفعل ذلك، فهو يعلم انني لا احب الرد المتأخر، كان يخبرني انه لا يشعر بثقل شيء طالما انا معه ، وأنه يشعر بثقل الدنيا على كاهله لو غبت عنه او ضجرت لقليلاً بسببه حتى ولو لثوانٍٍ، وعندما امضي ساعات طويلة احدثه عن مساوئي كان يضحك كثيراً ويقول "" انا قبلان، انا راضي انتي مالك ومالي يا عمي، انتي بعيوني غير""، وفعلاً... جاهد كثيراً حتى أصبحت أرى نفسي بعيونه، لأحب نفسي من جديد، واحبه أكثر وأحب الدنيا ،هو حبيبي ونور عمري ...

   يلومني على مقاطعة صديقتي ولكنه لا يعلم!، لا يعلم أن اهلي قبل ولادتي تركو بلاد الغربة وعادوا الى الوطن لكن المنطق يقول العكس، الوطن ان تكون بين اهلك لا على ارضك فقط يا عزيزي، أخذو برأسي من رحم أمي ووالله تلك كانت آخر ايام راحتي، استقبلوني بضربات على الظهر وضحكاتهم تعلو صوت بكائي. وكأنهم يقولون أهلا بالجحيم، اهلا بك حيث لا احد يكترث لبكاءك سوى امك الملقاة على السرير وتتلهف لتغمرك.
   
   ومضت الأيام بي على حال يرثى له، لا اذكر انه لنا اقرباء هنا غير عمي وعمتي بغض النظر عن المعارف الذين لا يذكرون. كبرت وسط 14 عشر طالبة في صفي منذ الصغر وكل واحد فيهم تكره الأخرى لا بأس فأنا كنت ابغضهن جميعا ايضا.
   
   لن أتحدث عن وحشة الترابط الأسري، فالوحوش خارج المنزل أكلت نصف قلبي وأكثر، جاوزت العشرين يا عزيزي وأول ما فعلته هو احصاء عدد مكاسبي وخسائري، مكاسب تعد على الأصابع وهزائم لا نهائية، والله تغيرت ولم أكن هكذا، ماتت دهشتي الأولى بالغرباء وبت عند التعارف اتوقع الأسوأ حتى لا يخيب ظني ولكن هذا قاس! . قاس على قلب ما زال صغيرا ومر بالكثير. رب انت لا تحمل نفسا فوق طاقتها فلماذا حل ذلك كله بي. كنت اغفر واغفر واغفر كل الذنوب حتى بت لا أغفر نظرة عفوية، أصبح كل شيء قاتل...ربما عند حديثي هذا كنت تهزأ وتقول دراما وما الى ذلك لكن لو اخبرك التفاصيل ستقول كيف! كيف مررت بكل هذا وما زلت كما انت لكنني والله لم اعد كما كنت ولا أظن ان هناك مجال للعودة ولا حتى لصداقة جديدة او احياء صداقات قديمة مبتورة فلندع كل شيء يمر كما يريد ولا نحارب لشيء يمضي، ونحصي الأيام والسنين فقط.

   انا اليوم تعرضت لموقف محرج كتير هالموقف بحياتي ما بنساه ورح ضل اتزكرو واحكي للكل عنو لأنو مش طبيعي موقف بظهر قمة الحقارة وقلة الأخلاق!! انا ما كنت هحكي عنو بس وصلت معي لحد الانسان ما بيقدر يتحملو!
   
   اليوم كنت رايحة ازور قريبتي مريضة بالسكري بالمستشفى الحكومي وكنت ماخدة معي علبة شوكولا وما كنت مفكرة غير بكل خير !
   
   بدخل عقسمها وفجأة بهجمو علي الأمن وبرفعو السلاح بوجهي وبهجمو الدكاترة عليي وبحكو اطلعي برا بسرعة وانا رفضت طبعا لأفهم ايش فيه! ولما يبست راسي وعاندت اتصلو المشفى بالشرطة وانا ببلشت اتوتر وخطرت ببالي الشوكلاتة فرميت العلبة مع طية الشرطة واصرو يتهجمو عليي وينادولي الاطفائية فانا استغربت جدا انو كيف وليش واشمعنى! ارتعبت وسألت اكتر من مرة ومحدا جاوب لاجت الاطفائية وصارو يحكو يا بتطلعي يا بنرشك بالمي صفنت مصدومة حكيتلهم انو لا بطلع بس بدي سبب مقنع يعني! حكولي انتي مجنونة كيف بتفوتي هيك عهاد القسم حكيتلهم لا مش مجنونة ولليش الاطفائية!  كان جواب الشرطي مع وصول المصور والصحافة وكل اشي مسجل بالحرف الواحد: يا مجنونة انتي سكر كيف بتدخلي عند مرضى السكري بتعرفي انك بتتسببي بخطر لحياتهم وجبنا الاطفائية مشان نرسك وتدوبي ازا بترفضي تطلعي.
   
   انا زعلت يجماعة وطلعت وحلفت يمين ما ازور مريض سكري للأبد ، عنجد ايشي مدايقني عالآخر انو ايش زنبي ازا ربنا خلقني هيك! ليش يجرحوني ويفضحوني!
   
   صدقوني كنتو رح تخسرو مي للأبد لولا ستر الله!

   هذا الحُبّ كان أكبر منّي ومِن مقدرتي، لِذلك مضيتُ تاركةً كُلّ شعوري على الوسائِد وأطراف الكراسي، ولَنْ ألتفت مُطلقًا، لأن هذه المرة كُنتُ قَدْ نويتُ أن أمضي حقًا، أن أمضي دون أن يهزّني أي شيء يتعلق بِك، مضيتُ تاركةً كُلّ شعورٍ خلفي، عاريةٌ مِن كُلّ ما يتعلق بِحكايتنا.

   ل م انم سوى ساعتين، ملأتُ صدري بهواءِ الفجر، قبلتُ رأسِ أمي، شعرتُ بالإمتنانِ لله، ضحكتُ إلى أن آلمتني معدتي، نزلت مني دمعة ساخنة، ركضتُ ولَعب الهواء بشعري، عانقتُ صَديق طويلاً، خُذلت من صَديق آخر، أغمضت عيوني عندما مشيتُ بجانب الملحمة، إبتسمتُ لغريبٍ ما، وساعدتُ طفلاً بعبورِ الشارع، ذابَ قلبي لحركةِ قطة صغيرة، وحزنتُ على قطعة الشوكولاتة التي فقدتها، جرحتُ إصبعي وبكيت، زَرعتُ صَبّارة، قرأتُ مئة صفحة من رواية، شعرت بغصة في صدري آلمتني، أمسكتُ قلمي وكتبت كثيراً جداً لكن لا أعرف ماذا كتبت، تأملتُ السَماء، دخلتُ نقاش وخَسرته من أجلِ راحتي، وَصلني كمٌّ من الجَمال من حَبيبتي يافا، وأخيراً اعتذرتُ لنفسي لأنني على قُلوب أحبّتي مثلَ الريشة، بينما هم على قَلبي مثلَ صَخرة.

   لم تكن بالنسبة لي مجرد علاقة أضع احتمال خسارتك فيها فيهون علي كل ما بيني و بينك ما أن ينتهي، بل كنت أعتبرك مشروع حياة، حياة كاملة. و لم أكن أرغب فقط بالحياةِ معك، بل بالموتِ معك. كنت أقول لنفسي بين الحين و الآخر: إن الصباح الذي سيحمل إلي أنفاسي الأخيرة، إنما أريد لهذه الأنفاس أن تكون على صدرك، و أنه إذا أُتيح لي ذلك فسأودّع العالم راضية كل الرضا، سأموت سعيدة كل السعادة، و إنما من أجل كل هذا آلمني فعلك أكثر من أي شيء آخر في هذا العالم، لأنني آمنتُ بك أكثر من كل شيء آخر في هذا العالم. يعذبني على نحوِ غير هيّن و لن يكون مؤقتاً أنك لم تفهم ولم تقدّر أي شيء من كل هذا.

   ”لعلك يا صديقي لا تعرف ولا تقدر معنى أن يختنق أحدهم بالحديث، محاولاً شرح نفسه للآخرين مفسراً كيف أنه لا يمتلك رفاهية أن يظهر هشاشته وضعفه، لا تعرف كم هو مؤلم ألا تبدو كما أنت أن تفقد الرغبة في العتاب.. أن تتظاهر بهذا القدر الهائل من اللامبالاة، بينما أنت تبالي أكثر من اللازم.”

  ","

   ليلة ما فيها ضو قمر كنت قادرة يومها اني ما اتطلع عالتاريخ ولا الساعة يمكن مش لأني ما بدي احفضهم يمكن لأنو ما كان خاطرلي اشي تاني غير صدمتي بس اسوأ تاريخ كان فيها 👌
   
   لَن أنسى تلكَ اللحظة التي ذَابَ فيها صوتي ولَم أنطُق ، التي أيقنتُ فيها أنكَ لم تَكُن مُلكِي لِأخسَرَك ، التي نِمتُ فيها كَمَن ينامُ على سِكَةِ حَديدٍ باردة ..!

   ها هُنا في كركبة الجمجمة حيثُ الشعور الكامن ، و اللاشعور في جلدي الذي نزف الدم ، و إزرقاق الأطراف ، و أشعر بعيناي حرقةٍ لا أدري من أين أشتعلت، فيأتي تسلسل أحداث ليلة أشرق صباحها و مازال النيكوتين يتجرع مني سواد حظ، و فعلٌ درامياً، لا حيلة لي في ، و أذكر أني غفوت بعد صباحاً من الصمت ، و أستيقظت بعد برهة من زمان كي أشعر بإن عيناي تبكي و أنا نائم ، إنتظرت غفوتي كي تبكي و لا تجعلني أنهل من حزنها ، على مشهداً من نزوح ، وحباً أعطى الورد لحديقةً ، و قابلتها إحتراقاً

   - بقدر رغبتي بك .. إلا أني عاهدت نفسي أن أكون بعيداً ، بعيداً جداً عن محيطك وكل شيء له علاقة بك ، لأنه لا يسعني أن أكون ذلك الغريب بعد أن كنت ملمة بكل تفاصيلك ، لا يسعني أن أحادثك بكل لطف ولباقة ومجاملة لأنه لطالما كرهت أنت هذا الأسلوب ، لا يسعني أن أكون أي شخص بعد أن كنت كل شيء.
