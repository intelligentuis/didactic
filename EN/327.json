I usually have earrings in, too. The most common ones you'd see me wearing would be the rabbit bracelet and my earrings, which aren't really visible because I wear my hair down lol.\n  ","351066":"\n  I have several: conflict, abandonment, being misunderstood (makes me want to tear my hair out), bugs, germs, needles, fire, heights (somewhat), and old\/submerged animatronics. With the heights thing, it's more that I fear falling in general. I'm afraid to ride a bike because I might fall off. And I fear all sources of pain, even having my arm squeezed or something.\n  ","351067":"\n  I have a photographic memory--I can remember things for hours or days after looking at them, sometimes even years. But I have a terrible short term memory; if you tell me to do something, I'll probably forget. I can remember sights and written things well but not things that are said to me (vocally), or requests. So my memory is both awful and great, depending on what I have to remember. If a memory is unpleasant, my brain completely censors it most of the time. I can forget entire months of information if I was in a terrible state at the time. If someone asks me to keep a secret, I will, not only because I don't believe in breaking secrets but because I forget what I'm told. I have a shitty memory when it comes to what I've told someone and what I haven't told them, too, so I sometimes repeat myself. Any inconsistencies in my statements (if you can find any) are usually because my memory sucks, too. For instance, I thought I wrote about 900 chapters of a story, but it was instead over 1,000. It was easy to forget just how many, because hey, that's a lot of chapters. Not that the numbers are drastically different or anything, but it's things like that which I forget, and you know how people are, they spin any minor inconsistency into some catastrophic travesty. Oh well.\n  ","351068":"\n  Aw, no problem! You're an amazing person, too, and I hope you find someone who cherishes you and truly loves you for who you are, because you deserve it!

By asking for them, you are kind of forcing people to like answers they do not care about and follow someone they likely do not want to follow, because sometimes it's hard to turn someone down if they ask you to do something. Basically if people want to do it, they will, without you asking. And most of the people who ask for likes are liars--they say they will give you some in exchange for giving them some, but they never do. I even go back and remove all the likes I gave them. Maybe that sounds petty, but I have every right to, and I get so annoyed.\n  ","351070":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2011\/02\/14\/133693152\/the-dark-origins-of-valentines-day\n  \n","351071":"\n  You know, people often tell me that, and I'm not sure why. I don't find myself to be very relatable--I have pet sea monkeys, I have lucid dreams, I have a big collection of medicine bottles because I want to make a statue out of them, I have a dead animal's teeth in my room, I have various paraphilias, I have an entire mattress covered in nothing but stuffed animals (not even a blanket), I casually listen to the Sad Satan soundtrack, Revolution 9, and Everywhere at the End of Time, I never cut my nails, I have a strange writing style I have not seen anyone use before, etc. Anyway, just rambling lol.\n  ","351072":"\n  Thanks! I love astrology, haha. My sun is Scorpio, my moon is Aries, my Mercury is Scorpio, my Venus is Scorpio, my Mars is Libra, my Jupiter is Leo, my Saturn is Gemini, my Uranus is Aquarius, and my rising is Aries, to name a few. If the birth time is correct, that is. My mom seems to always change the time I was born because she can't remember, but this chart makes the most sense to me. Otherwise I get something like a Pisces moon and Libra rising, but I relate to the Aries placements. Lol I understand that. People call MBTI pseudoscience, as well, but this is because they do not read about cognitive functions and see how accurate and reliable it truly is. Anything people know little about is automatically called pseudoscience, really. I like reading about those things, though, because they help me understand people better, as well as myself. I relate to this article about my enneagram type quite a bit, for instance:\n  \n   https:\/\/www.psychologyjunkie.com\/2020\/03\/09\/enneagram-type-nine-the-peacemaker\/\n  \n\n  Just not the parts about procrastination (I'm a workaholic). It should also be noted that I'm an unhealthy 9 at the moment, so I'm less of a mediator and more of someone who is avoidant of conflict and disagreements altogether. In fact, if people disagree with me, I straight up block them, because they disrupt my sense of personal harmony. The part about being afraid to leave my house is especially true. I get paranoid even just seeing cars pass by me.\n  ","351073":"\n  Crushes are kind of dumb, at least if they concern people you know nothing about. It's fine to want to know more about someone, but having a crush on someone just because of something like their outer beauty is foolish. In this situation the word infatuation is necessary. Infatuation determines what we find beautiful. Love is about what is internal--appreciating someone and finding them beautiful for what is not on the surface. Crushes are automatically based on lust\/infatuation unless you know the person well and have fallen in love with their actual character.\n  ","351074":"\n  Oh, I'm fine. I've read a lot about meth, and addicts often feel that something is crawling in their skin (like bugs). Not that your mom ever did drugs or anything, just that I've read that sort of description lol. I'm only really bothered when people talk about needles and veins, since those things scare me. I've had fairly good treatment. I refuse to take antidepressants, so I have to deal with my OCD and depressive episodes on my own. Too many negative side effects for my taste. My antipsychotic meds are great, though. Only side effects are drowsiness, occasional nausea (accompanied by hot flashes), and occasional restless feet. I can't stand when meds cause tremors, a low libido, emotional deadness, etc. It took months to get any treatment, but I know it takes years for other people, especially if treatment is expensive where they live.\n  ","351075":"\n  That is odd indeed. Mine is strange, too, haha. Normally when you think of OCD, you think of someone washing their hands many times a day or turning a light on and off, not watching 27+ anime episodes a day. Hm, I suppose it means you are trying to \"rid away\" the source of any anxiety, but ironically OCD just breeds more anxiety. It's hard to break the compulsion\/obsessive thought cycle. Obsessive thoughts are still preferred, though. I hope you know why you feel anxious? I have an issue with identifying what I feel anxious about and thus why I have compulsive behavior.\n  ","351076":"\n  Ah, it's harmful to convince your child that they can save you somehow or to say you are the reason they are alive. My mom goes on about how I'm the reason she's alive, but it's too much weight to put on someone, that without you they'd be unstable or dead. Yeah, it makes sense that it took so long, because parents make their kids think magic is a real thing--that Santa can be in so many places at once, for instance, and that he exists at all. Religiosity can lead to those \"magical\" delusions.\n  ","351077":"\n  Some religious people really suck, they think everything unpleasant is the work of demons and if you pray then your illnesses will disappear. I'm an atheistic Buddhist, myself. No prayers and such for me. My parents are very mentally ill, too. I suspect my mom has BPD, or something of a similar nature. My father is a depressed alcoholic. It's a shame to grow up in an environment of an unhealthy parent or two unhealthy parents. People shouldn't be ostracized for being mentally ill, they should receive care and understanding--of course, they should want it for themselves, too.\n  ","351078":"\n  Thank you, and no problem. Yeah, people are quite misinformed about mental illnesses, even the most common ones like depression and anxiety. Schizoaffective disorder is more uncommon, so it's important that people know about it. And the distinction between that and bipolar with psychotic features. It's good that you understand OCD from personal experience.\n  ","351079":"\n  I know some people online who have it. I do not hallucinate as much on meds and rarely have delusions, but I still get catatonic episodes when upset. I'm no longer derealized or depersonalized. I have a trans sibling, he's been taking testosterone for a year or so. Our parents aren't accepting of it. Yeah, I imagine they think it's bad parenting on your part. People make all sorts of assumptions.\n  ","351080":"\n  Oh, not at all, it's nice when people ask about my illnesses. I'm going to get a degree in clinical psychology, myself. I have CPTSD from ongoing online harassment. It was quite unmanageable in the past, but I've mostly come to terms with it. I used to have an eating disorder, and I had severe entomophobia. Most of my hallucinations are of bugs, actually. The entomophobia is minor now, and my mysophobia is kind of improving. My OCD primarily consisted of compulsions in the past, but I struggle more with obsessive and intrusive thoughts nowadays. I've had many panic attacks before, so I understand your panic disorder.\n  ","351081":"\n  No. Obviously I cannot speak on behalf of people with conditions I do not have (such as autism), but as a schizoaffective person, I do not believe it's bad to call someone schizophrenic or schizoaffective. Calling someone psychotic is bad because it's falsely associated with calling them crazy. Just like manic (bipolar) people started being called maniacs. People have a history of using mental illnesses as synonyms for craziness. It's fine to say \"a person with psychosis,\" or a schizophrenic person. People with autism have grown comfortable with calling them neurodivergent, but I personally find this foolish, because it gives others the perception that autism is the only neurodivergent condition--some other neurodivergent conditions are OCD and tinnitus. So though I have OCD, I would not call myself neurodivergent, since it's come to be associated with autism. Calling people neurotypical if they do not have autism or another neurodivergent condition is also foolish, because by default if someone has a mental illness then they aren't neurotypical (as in, their brain is not the \"typical brain\"). I do not take offense to the word \"schizo,\" personally, though I suppose it depends on the connotation someone is using (since they could use it as a synonym for psychotic, which they use to mean crazy). It's fine to say someone has a psychotic disorder or is in a psychotic state, though it's important to note that though they can have a psychotic disorder, it doesn't always mean they're in a psychotic state. So really it's all about associations and intent.\n  ","351082":"\n  I have experienced some before, mostly by family members. I had low empathy in the past, which is a common symptom of schizoaffective disorder, and I've been seen as a bad person because of it, but I was just very mentally ill back then. People also misunderstand because it's unusual to have this mental illness at a young age--I started showing symptoms of it at 13 (I'm not 13 anymore, but I still have the symptoms, of course), but it's not surprising, because I had an early puberty and thus developed illnesses earlier, too. There have been bug infestations at my house, and whenever I complained about them, my father insisted that I must have hallucinated the bugs (no, they were real). It's either people acting like I am constantly in a psychotic state (I rarely hallucinate on meds, and I've been on meds for years) or I am not taken seriously. I used to have an anime watching compulsion from my OCD, in which I had to watch 27+ episodes every day (on school days I watched around 12 because I had less time), and people did not understand that not meeting my episode quota each day made me anxious. A friend kept telling me to forget about my episodes and come over to her house, but I refused. I have extreme emotional responses to very small things, and I've been called emotionally immature because of it, but it's not about that, it's because of my mood disorder that I can't manage how I feel. My mood stabilizer meds do not help much, so I become extremely depressed very easily, and for an unreasonably long time. I was depressed for 28\/29 days of February 2020, for example. It's difficult because the schizophrenic part of my disorder gives me reduced feelings (such as low empathy) while the bipolar part gives me intense feelings. It's either one extreme or the other with me. :\/ And people of course misunderstand what these disorders entail. OCD is not about being neat. I get irritated when people are like \"I'm so OCD\" because they like for colored pencils to be in the right order. When I was at a mental hospital years ago, I couldn't touch a marker after someone else had touched it because I thought it was diseased. That's how my OCD is. Simply looking at blood makes me panic and have obsessive thoughts about contracting a disease. I think around 1\/4 of people with OCD have obsessive thoughts about diseases (I read a memoir about someone with this type of OCD). if someone accidentally spits on me while talking, I start thinking they gave me hepatitis. It's very annoying. And as for the people who say \"I'm so OCD,\" their defense is that not all kinds of OCD are the same. But they just have OCPD rather than OCD.\n  ","351083":"\n  Well, people falsely use psychotic as a synonym for crazy, when instead it means you are afflicted with psychosis. An example of a psychotic disorder is schizophrenia--it means you have hallucinations and delusions. When I have a psychotic episode, I start having auditory hallucinations and get head\/body spasms; alongside those, I start repeating random syllables or words (palilalia). It's an unpleasant sight, but only one person has seen it happen. The word \"upset\" sounds minor, but psychosis is something extreme. I wish people stopped using psychotic to mean crazy (now, I'm not sure if you used it to mean that, but I'm making a social complaint here lol). Not all people with psychotic disorders are irrational, which I would say is the definition of crazy. If someone is irrational and delusional then I'd consider them to be crazy, but I only know one person who suits that word. It's excessively thrown around. If someone is sad then it doesn't mean they are irrational\/delusional--they could be, of course, but being sad implies more of a lack of motivation, while craziness seems to imply too much motivation.\n  ","351084":"\n  Hello. Well, I am schizoaffective (bipolar type), so I have depressive episodes. I had one yesterday, in fact... I hate my extreme moods. It took me years to stop self harming, because I was very suicidal for a long time. Basically my whole family is depressed. I try to take care of my mental health, but it usually doesn't work. I try to help my friends with theirs.\n  ","351085":"\n  I liked them when they first started releasing music. Now their songs have become too westernized, if you get what I mean. They appeal to a larger audience, which I'm not a fan of. I liked how their songs suited a niche audience in the past. I still listen to their older songs sometimes, but their new songs are bad with all the autotune and such. The singers are funny, but their personalities are fake, like with any other K-pop group. Artificial people with artificial music....\n  ","351086":"\n  I have to make various difficult decisions for my sea monkeys. It's hard to know whether to remove any of their corpses or not, for instance. If they die of natural causes then you shouldn't remove them, but if they die of a disease then you have to remove them or it will spread to the ones that are alive and the whole population will die off... you do not know why they died, though, so you do not know what should be done. And should you give them a certain salt or a different one? Try to grow algae in a separate tank or the one they're in? Give them food now or wait a few days? Remove their molted skins or leave them there? I have so many decisions to make... they may seem easy to take care of on the surface, but they aren't.\n  ","351087":"\n  To be well, someone needs:\n  \n  A good support system\n  \n  Healthy habits\/a healthy lifestyle\n  \n  Ambition\n  \n  A stable environment\n  \n  Less of an emphasis on wants\n  \n  Optional: friends\n  ","351088":"\n  I have the shortest attention span. It's fine if someone messages me maybe once a month, but conversations always bore\/annoy me. I'm fine with exchanging long messages with someone about their problems, since I love to help, but I have no time for legitimate conversations, you know. Send me a long message about your life story and problems and I'll reply with a long message back maybe 2 weeks later (sometimes months later), but I have no attention span for a continuous back and forth, especially if I gain nothing from it. This is why it's impossible to be friends with me, I hate normal conversations and who knows when I'll get back to you, if I ever do. So to answer the question, maybe 5 minutes lol. Offline I hate talking to people, so even less.\n  ","351089":"\n  Hm, I think people are more inclined to accept who they are if they feel that other people accept who they are. Self-perception problems are largely based on someone's environment. For instance, people are usually self-loathing when they are used to being insulted by others (often by parents), and the solutions are either to detach themselves from external perceptions or surround themselves with people who are kinder toward them. Your only responsibility here is to support this person and show them you accept them for who they are. It's not about figuring them out; they will do that on their own, if you let them.\n  ","351090":"\n  Probably not my best, but I like this picture.\n  ","351091":"\n  Eh, just certificates for getting good grades, really. A couple of my poems were featured in our school's literary magazine, too, so I guess I \"won\" that? I got an honorable mention for a short story I wrote, so it wasn't a PRIZE prize. It was because I didn't write about what the judges wanted to read about. The guy who won wrote about diversity--mine was just some fictional short story, without a \"powerful\" message. The funniest part, though, is that the short story is actually incestuous, so I cut most of the scenes out and changed names to make it sound normal.\n  ","351092":"\n  Yeah, I actually did the second one for my mom's birthday card in the past, but it was kind of a failure, lol. Maybe it was the wrong paint or the circles were too big... does bubblewrap come in different sizes? ;;; I just randomly had some in my room, so I looked up art I could make with it. I once had a blank roll of film and I decided to sew drawings on to it. It was pretty fun. But I suck at sewing, so it was messy.\n  ","351093":"\n  There are three kinds--painting something directly on to the bubblewrap and then pressing the pattern on to a piece of paper (this is difficult to do), drawing on a piece of paper and painting a single color or so on to the bubblewrap and then pressing it in the middle of the pattern (such as drawing a tree and then adding bubblewrap circles for leaves), and painting a picture through the design of it being made of bubblewrap (similar to making a drawing out of tiny dots... there is, in other words, a large pattern made of small things).\n  ","351094":"\n  Yes! My favorite is Totodile. The first Pok\u00e9mon game I played was Pok\u00e9mon Crystal, and I've always preferred water starters, so I went with Totodile. It's very cute and I like its moves. Also the evolved name, Feraligatr, is funny, because they did not put an o and make it Feraligator. The sprite has major booty, too. I tend to like unevolved forms more than evolved ones, so Totodile is better.\n  ","351095":"\n  Here's my tank. Most of the shrimp are pretty small lol.\n  ","351096":"\n  I read online that you could give aquarium salt to sea monkeys, so my dad got some for me, but apparently it's for sick fish and doesn't evaporate. Marine salt dissolves and is for aquatic creatures in general, from what I understand. I guess aquarium salt is for actual fish, and since I have brine shrimp, it doesn't really apply. There is a lot of conflicting information on sea monkey care online, so I've resorted to asking people on Reddit for help, lol.\n  ","351097":"\n  Hello. I would get vaccinated for covid, but I am not a priority at the moment, so a vaccine is not offered for me. I consider flu vaccines to be useless, but other vaccines are effective. Anti-vaxxers should go to prison for child neglect--it is cruel to not vaccinate your children. As for the pharmaceutical industry, I certainly believe they hide cures from the public, in order to garner more money. I suspect they have truly found the cure for cancer but withhold it from everyone so hospitals get money for ongoing treatments. Big pharma's tendency to give painkillers out like candy to create more addicts is pernicious for those who truly need them--my mom has a disease, for instance, which she needs painkillers for, and doctors have wrongfully accused her of being a drug addict\/refused to give them to her.\n  ","351098":"\n  I seem to experience d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu very often. I remember how one time in middle school I was in French class and I had this strong feeling I had seen all these students before, learned what the teacher was teaching before, heard someone say a specific line before, etc. Another time was when I was in the car and we passed by a house, and I felt I had been there before.\n  ","351099":"\n  That's true. It's important to find someone who shares your values and believes strongly in things such as devotion. I can't say much about men because I have a girlfriend, and this is the only relationship I've been in. Men are more likely to cheat, though. They seem to have less empathy and thus do not care if they hurt others. It's best to walk away from people like that, because cheating is unforgivable + they will likely never change.\n  ","351100":"\n  Eh, you can always say you are busy, because when are people not busy? Or you can change the subject. It's harder to escape in real life than online, in which you can say you have to sleep soon, your eyes hurt from staring at the screen for too long, etc. Only say these things if they are true, though. Changing the subject is your best bet (IRL and online). But make it natural, instead of asking if you can change the subject.\n  ","351101":"\n  Maybe Caroline of Ansbach? I know little about queens, but what I am reading of her does not mention religion as it does with other queens. I do not care about religion, so. Other places mention her being Protestant, though... it really is unavoidable. :\/ She was a very influential woman, and devoted to her husband, despite his infidelity. She was intelligent and loved art and literature, too.\n  ","351102":"\n  I'm either seen as intimidating or very welcoming; there's rarely an in between. One of my friends said she thought I hated her when she first talked to me, but I didn't. I think people have trouble reading my expressions and think I am mad when I'm not. People online have assumed I hate them, too. It's some weird commonality. Either that or they think I am someone they can share anything with. It's not surprising, because I am very open, myself. I think this encourages them to be open, too.\n  ","351103":"\n  Well, that's how feelings work in general. If I say I am sad, you can neither prove it nor disprove it, because you are not the one feeling that way. There are some ways of identifying how someone feels, such as body language, but they are not always reliable. When it comes to love, there are ways of proving you love someone, through sacrifice, defending\/protecting them, supporting them, etc. I wouldn't say you should always believe someone who says they love you, unless they can prove it.\n  ","351104":"\n  I have trouble remembering specific days, so these things may have happened on separate days, but this occurrence is my favorite memory: I was on vacation with my lover, and we went kayaking and saw a heron sitting on a log, and one eating a lizard. It was very special to me--I developed a great love for herons. We went to the gift shop nearby and got ice cream. We then went to the park and I accidentally got the ice cream all over my face. I chased after a squirrel, too. There was this beautiful patch of grass we looked at. We then went for a walk and sat on a swing, looking at a body of water with ducks. They had colorful feathers, and one of the feathers was on the ground, so I took it. Along our walk, we gathered many more feathers. I think the reason why we went back to the cabin was because my feet started to hurt lol.\n  ","351105":"\n  Getting likes on Ask. :\/ I usually wake up to like 40-70 of them, but today 1... I feel like people gave up on my page during\/after the error in which I couldn't upload background pictures. It made me realize that all I am to people is the backgrounds, and my answers are hardly valued. Even the person who traditionally likes all of my answers has seemingly vanished. Maybe it's a dumb thing to be upset about, but that's how I feel.\n  ","351106":"\n  It's difficult to understand what true happiness would mean for me. I am truly happy with my lover, for instance, but I am still mentally ill, self-loathing, etc. I have to work on my self image, how I respond to upsetting things, and so on. I have had episodes in which I felt completely elated and like nothing could puncture my joy--but then the episodes were ruined, of course. One of those took place in March (or was it April?) of 2018, and it lasted maybe two weeks. But it was more of this \"fuzzy\" happiness, the kind that is distracting and overwhelming. I was relatively happy around 6th grade--not especially mentally ill, and just enjoying the simplicity of each day. I tend to say 5th grade was the happiest time of my life, but that is more of a delusion. My parents started fighting all the time, and sometimes my mom threatened to leave and never return. But school was pleasant, for the most part. I was very passionate about anime, too, but the passion was crushed years later, when watching it became a compulsion. I was rather depressed, but the pleasant memories compensated for the unpleasant ones. I wonder if I was ever truly happy. Certainly not in high school, the worst years of my life. I am content right now (kind of), but truly happy, eh.\n  ","351107":"\n  I would generally say by how open they are, but that is not always the case. Rather, if they are consistent throughout the years and do not change their stories, then I would find them honest. Of course, people are not always consistent--their memory may fail them, or their mood may be different. But information about their life should not change, for instance.\n  ","351108":"\n  I assume you mean to say allow--I sometimes allow them, but I disable them whenever someone starts interrogating me, harassing me, etc. Too many \"Why?\" questions make me anxious, and anonymous users tend to ask those questions (those who ask \"Why?\" often have bad intentions, at least on Ask). They are usually only enabled for maybe a day or two before I disable them again. People just disappoint me, in the end.\n  ","351109":"\n  Hm, an opportunity to improve... I know this sounds silly, but try as I might, I've never been able to understand long division. Yes, they teach it in elementary school, but I could never quite grasp it. So here I am, months away from going to university, and I still do not know long division. However, I hope to become a tutor over the summer, and I'd like to learn long division before then, so I can explain it to someone if they ask about it. As for something else... I would like to improve my mental state, as well. Reading classical literature every day is supposed to help my psychosis. Essentially with psychosis, your senses are all intensified, to the point where they become dysfunctional. Recognizing timeless symbols\/meanings is supposed to alleviate the sense issue. I've been reading classical fiction every day, as such.\n  ","351110":"\n  Taking care of my plants and sea monkeys, watching my sea monkeys swim and eat (something about them is precious to me), seeing how the sunlight illuminates my room (cloudy days are bland), looking at various things around my room, collecting small toys and other items, listening to birds chirping and wind chimes, learning new words, being complimented on my writing (or even just someone showing an interest in it), eating spicy ramen every Saturday, seeing a new chapter translation of a manga I like being released....\n  ","351111":"\n  Good luck. When it happens on my phone, it usually means I have to update the app, so that's a fix. But it started happening despite the app being updated, and they told me that it was because I was using a version of Android that is not supported by the app. However, my phone will not update no matter what. It's not a considerably old version, and I've only had the phone since late 2018, so it should still update, but it does not... so, it's more so Ask's problem for not supporting that version, since there is nothing I can do about it. The error message typically goes away within a few hours or so, but it's been going on since yesterday or something. As for the desktop version, it will not let me upload pictures. And for some reason they only allow background images on the app--the site only allows non-background images. They should add background images to the site, as well. But both seem to be broken at the moment.\n  ","351112":"\n  I took this picture--it's from the Rise of Insanity game. I was quite impressed by the visuals.\n  ","351113":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LQcMOI8dMas&ab_channel=Weezer-Topic\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351114":"\n  Let's see... well, I'm not sure of my habits, but my compulsions and schedule, yes. I guess when it comes to habit, I try to write a bit every day. I used to have an actual schedule for writing. I wrote three pages in a notebook per day, then years later I spent an hour and a half (?) writing every day. Now even just a punctuation mark is an achievement. I'm not sure what could be classified as a habit in my life. I translate every day, but I'm not an excellent translator, and not even fluent in the language. I keep the curtains open every day for my plants to have sunlight. I have a bag covered in the dates I watered my plants on, to keep track. I do homework after waking up, and I even do assignments many days before they're due. I have some bad habits, like never cutting my nails, scratching at my face (I have a rash), leaning forward in my chair (I have bad posture), etc....\n  ","351115":"\n  I'm much too avoidant. Someday I will have to expose myself to this and that... it's not that everything is scary, I just find things to be unnecessary or uninteresting. I mean, why get my learner's permit and license when I don't have a car (or the money to buy one)? I'm not terrible with interacting with people, I just have no interest in it. Isolation does not make me feel lonely, but this environment is not beneficial for seclusion... I have to leave it eventually.\n  ","351116":"\n  This was taken a long time ago lol. I never really take food pics. This happens to have food in it, but it wasn't the central focus.\n  ","351117":"\n  I do not deal with them, but when I was younger I took care of my younger brother for my parents, because they were busy with work. My mom often says she could not have done it without me, and she is impressed by how well I took care of him (especially given that I was not very old, myself). So based on that I would say I'm fairly good with them? I also assisted some younger kids throughout elementary school.\n  ","351118":"\n  Oh, I see. Well, many people make the mistake of thinking someone is the person in the pictures they choose. They might be, but they could also be catfishing. This is why it's best to do a video call. As for the parents, you can keep the relationship a secret if you have to, or let them get to know the person through video calls, too, then later reveal that that person is more than a friend to you.\n  ","351119":"\n  I mean, I don't really see what's scary about them. The person can be with someone IRL but they choose you, someone who is likely very far away from them. To me that shows that their feelings are more genuine, so if anything relationships offline are scarier. I met my lover online--I fell in love with her before I even saw what she looked like. We've been together for over three years. But it's not exactly an \"online relationship\" because we've spent a considerable amount of time together in real life, too. I understand if someone is afraid that their partner will leave them for someone who lives nearby, instead, but you also have to remember that the person chose to be with you in the first place, not someone else. If you can't go on without physical contact then I wouldn't recommend it. It's more for people who can handle being apart for long periods of time. And both people have to be that way for it to work out. But it shows that the relationship is strong and sincere if you do not need physical contact all the time. There is more independence, too.\n  ","351120":"\n  It depends on the intention of both people, and how well they can handle a lack of physical affection. Online relationships can be more meaningful than IRL ones because you can handle not being with the person in real life for extended periods of time. However, if the relationship exists because both people are lonely, or if the conversations are superficial, it does not work out. I also do not believe people should actively search for a partner and should instead wait for someone to come to them--in other words, things like dating apps make no sense to me.\n  ","351121":"\n  Yes. Many people still see me from the perspective of my past, but I am no longer the same cold, unsympathetic, emotionless, paranoid, and possibly aggressive person I once was. Now I am way too emotional and caring, essentially the opposite of the spectrum. That does not mean, however, that I am no longer a sadist, that I am no longer mentally ill, that my attraction is gone, etc. Things do not magically disappear. But I have developed traits I did not realize I had. I am quite the nurturing person now. My relationship is great. I will NEVER be with a man; sorry, Mom. I do not know why, but \"intellectuals\" try to analyze me and their analyses are completely wrong. One guy years ago tried very hard to get me to admit to cutting myself, but I never even cut myself, lol. I did not self harm at all at the time--and when I did end up self harming in the future, it was through strangulation, not cutting. I have way too low of a pain tolerance for that sort of thing. I have no clue why some people mistake me for a masochist, especially when my username has the word sadist in it, but they are blind and stupid. I am a very open and honest person, but some people strangely think that means I will answer sexual questions and such. No, I will not. I think they try to take advantage of how open I am. Also, while I have many unusual fetishes, that does not mean I intend to act upon certain ones, I just like them in porn. The amount of times I have had people ask me if I am attracted to a family member just because I like incest porn (which is arguably not even strange, compared to my other fetishes)... no, I do not like any family members in that way. I do not mind polygamy in porn, but I am a strictly monogamous person, as another example. I like scat porn and worm porn, but I am not interested in acting on either of those things IRL. I love drug research, but I have never done any drugs. People have a hard time knowing when I am being serious and when I am joking, so they either take me too seriously or assume I am a troll (I am not, for the record). And for some reason they think the fact that I do not like discussing my age equates to me lying about it? I never lie about it, I just like to keep it a secret, because of past harassment over it and people treating me a certain way because of it. Even though it has been years since then, the remnants of the mistreatment\/stereotypes have stayed with me.\n  ","351122":"\n  Both. I have a schedule every day, but it is not as strict as it used to be. Give sea monkeys oxygen around 10:30 AM, translate at 5:30 PM, take medicine and give sea monkeys more oxygen at 10:30 PM, shower at 11:15 PM, and sleep around 1:50 AM. But really I can translate whenever, just as long as it's every day (no missing any days no matter what). Other things I do at random times.\n  ","351123":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=woZwzRSI15w&ab_channel=LoFidelityAllstars-Topic\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351124":"\n  I told you, when they have to protect themselves or their family members.

If you cannot be satisfied with the state of mind you have in zazen, it means your mind is still wandering about. Our body and mind should not be wobbling or wandering about. In this posture there is no need to talk about the right state of mind. You already have it. This is the conclusion of Buddhism.\"\n  \n  Buddhism is all about finding inner peace through love for everyone\/everything, including yourself. With love and the relinquishing of the ego, there is no more suffering.\n  \n  Here are some about peace and the ego:\n  \n  \"If we hold on to our humility, if we let go of our egos and stop clinging to whatever it is we're clinging to, we'll find the wonderful surprise that behind all that gunk is a natural kindness, a love for everyone and everything that we never thought we had. And if we let ourselves act from that place, we'll discover a kindness without limits and an unutterable peace.\"\n  \n  \"We surround all men and all forms of life with infinite love and compassion. Particularly do we send forth loving thoughts to those in suffering and sorrow; to all those in doubt and ignorance; to all who are striving to attain truth, and to those whose feet are standing close to the great change men call death, we send forth oceans of wisdom, mercy, and love.\"\n  \n  \"'You can search the whole tenfold universe and not find a single being more worthy of love and compassion than the one seated here--yourself.' Self-compassion and self-forgiveness are not weaknesses, but the roots of our courage and magnanimity. Sometimes compassion for ourselves and others seems hard to find. But even if you lose touch with these feelings during your most intense suffering, compassion is an essential part of our true nature. In fact, it is in this self-compassion and self-love that you find the strength to carry a lamp through your darkest nights. And it is by first practicing self-compassion that you find not only a way to hold your own struggles and sorrows in your heart--but through them you learn how to connect with the sufferings and sorrows of all those around.\"\n  \n  \"A man once told Buddha, 'I want happiness.' Buddha replied, 'First, remove 'I'; that's ego. Then remove 'want'; that's desire. And now all you're left with is happiness.\"\n  \n  \"The ego says, 'I shouldn't have to suffer,' and that thought makes you suffer so much more. It is a distortion of the truth, which is always paradoxical. The truth is that you need to say yes to suffering before you can transcend it.\"\n  \n  \"Often people attempt to live their lives backwards: they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want, so they will be happier. The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first be who you really are, then do what you need to, in order to have what you want.\"\n  ","351127":"\n  I like kitten ASMR, like this video:\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lk-Br9AVVXU&ab_channel=myPetsASMR\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351128":"\n  No, I feel that way regarding literature. People prefer to read whatever is simple and does not require much thought, so when you write something more meaningful and metaphorical it is seen as pretentious or overly convoluted. People are required to think less, especially with knowledge at everyone's fingertips (through search engines), but despite the availability of knowledge, they are still so stupid and mindless.\n  ","351129":"\n  It annoys me when people say all bodily cells are replaced every 7-10 years. They are replaced at different times, which is why the whole \"Your rapist's touch will be gone in 7 years\" thing is stupid. Skin cells are replaced roughly every 10-30 days. Cervical cells are replaced every 6 days. It's not like your rapist is touching your red blood cells, bone cells, etc. So you don't have to wait 7-10 years. Also, braincells cannot be replaced throughout your lifetime, so the \"ALL cells\" thing simply isn't true. I think it's harmful to perpetuate this false information to rape victims because it makes them feel helpless and like they have to wait years to be \"clean,\" when in reality it's much shorter.\n  ","351130":"\n  My many ambitions. I'm by nature a very hardworking person, especially because of my OCD. I get obsessive thoughts about assignments until I finish them. But I have many goals I want to achieve, and when it comes to professions, I want to be a psychologist, author, taxidermist, photographer, and translator, all at once. I'm 1\/3 through the novel I'm writing, over halfway through a book I'm translating, and I have some minor experience with psychology and photography. Well, maybe not minor for psychology, but I haven't started officially studying it, so. As for taxidermy, I have an animal's jaw in my room. I had to get rid of the skin that was hanging off of it and the bugs and dirt on it (I found it on the ground in the forest). So I have some cleaning experience, but not actual stuffing experience and such. Anyway, I am always working toward my goals. Another incentive is money; I want enough money so that I can travel the world (not just for personal enjoyment but photography). My lover is very hardworking, too, so we motivate each other, as well.\n  ","351131":"\n  Yes, my lover has greatly shaped me as a person. I was going off the deep end before she came along--I planned to commit a heinous crime and commit suicide or spend my life in jail. But then I fell in love with her and had a reason to want a normal life--to want to get married, have children, be happy, be free. She brought out my nurturing side, which I had formerly shoved into oblivion. I didn't think I was capable of loving someone, and I was never interested in being in a relationship, but after I found someone who truly understood and accepted me, I naturally fell in love. It's strange how I went from an emotionless and homicidal person to someone very emotional, caring, etc., but that's what happened.\n  ","351132":"\n  (Not my pic)\n  ","351133":"\n  Hm, isn't the difference between daily intermittent fasting and eating once a day the amount of food consumed? With intermittent fasting you would eat food with enough calories to compensate for the meals you skip, while with eating once a day you would just consume 400 calories or something. So intermittent fasting is only good if you eat enough.\n  ","351134":"\n  I have a compulsion to leave conversations because all of them bore me. And I mean absolutely all of them, unless they are about my writing. I become basically impossible to talk to, no matter how interesting someone is. I don't reply unless I have a certain goal, like helping the person with their mental illness(es), in which case I write mountains of text. But my wrists are swollen and occasionally the wrist bones themselves hurt, so I can't type for long. It's a difficult situation--I want to type so much but I have this impediment, so I end up replying late. IRL the most difficult part is probably maintaining eye contact. I stopped maintaining it years ago when I was most paranoid\/not on meds. I thought by looking into someone's eyes, they could read my mind. And though I do not have that thought anymore, the sensation is still there, so I can't look.\n  ","351135":"\n  I got this LED planet that I love.\n  ","351136":"\n  No. It has its pros and cons. I think it makes people lazier, but it makes others more creative. It can be a good treatment for diseases. It impacts depth perception, leading to car crashes. It can trigger psychosis and give people panic attacks. I acknowledge that it's healthier than something like cigarettes. But like any drug, it just causes superficial happiness and encourages people not to face their actual problems. It becomes an emotional crutch. And yes, it can in fact be addicting, despite what some people say. Anyway, I don't trust anything going into the lungs that isn't oxygen.\n  ","351137":"\n  I took this picture a long time ago. Yes, my plant was dying.\n  ","351138":"\n  Things can be overcome through perceptions but not always through physical means. If you have a brian tumor, you can't do much to prevent yourself from dying from it. Not all tumors can be removed, after all. Diseases in general are hardships that cannot always be overcome. But if you have a positive mindset, you have already overcome your illness, in a sense. It's all the resisting that people do which makes them suffer.\n  ","351139":"\n  Not always. Some changes are good--changing your lifestyle to be healthier, changing your friend group to get rid of mean friends, changing how you perceive yourself (to be nicer toward yourself), etc. Other changes, like moving somewhere, getting a new job, changing your meds, etc., might be detrimental (but could also be good). You never really know if a change will be good for you or not, unless it's very obvious (as with the example of a healthy lifestyle). I'm not very afraid of change, but I hate certain things changing, like leaving my bedroom behind for a college dorm room soon. Some changes, like puberty or ageing in general, can be hard to manage for many people.\n  ","351140":"\n  It can. It's all about what you expose yourself to. If you follow a bunch of very skinny girls on Instagram and develop an eating disorder because of them, it's less so the fault of social media and more so the fault of the material you choose to consume. Social media makes it easier for people to bully you, however, and in that sense it is truly harmful (and often not your fault). If you are concerned about it ruining your mental health, you should definitely take a break or change which social media platform(s) you're on.\n  ","351141":"\n  It depends on someone's mental state. It's bad to give too much of yourself to people when you should be focusing on yourself. Of course, that doesn't mean you should stop giving entirely. It's important to be a part of a community, otherwise your thoughts are all \"I\" focused, which ruins your health. In a bad state, it should be about 70% self (improvement) focused and 30% focused on (helping) other people. In a good state, about 40% self focused and 60% focused on others. If you are too focused on others then you lose sight of yourself, but if you are too focused on yourself then you become too detached from other people\/the world. This is also dependent on the nature of the focus. I'm not saying that in a bad state that 70% should be all self-loathing and such. No, it means to prioritize your own health\/well-being over that of others. Because in order to help people better, you have to first be in a stable state.\n  \n  Though if by your question you mean information, well, evaluating the pros and cons of sharing various things. Also testing the waters with friends and potential friends, by indirectly referring to yourself.\n  ","351142":"\n  It depends on the situation. I believe, for instance, that one of the reasons why people commit crimes is because they feel estranged from society, hated by the world. Their actions are fueled by anger over not being accepted\/understood. So in that case it's important to see that the person was impacted by their environment, to better the environment for people in the future (before they, too, commit crimes). You can of course go \"Oh, they are just a terrible person,\" but that simply isn't true. People are not \"born evil\" or any of that bullshit individuals spout to not take responsibility for anything. As an individual, though, your focus (what's more important) is what you become. Successful, for example. Most people do not magically become successful, so you should care about how you become that way. But the ultimate goal is the success itself. Or maybe you want to become rich. You can become rich through means of luck--winning the lottery. Or you can work toward it. There are various ways to become the person you want to become. The how is the means to the end, and also what other people should see about you.\n  ","351143":"\n  I wouldn't say it's a matter of love but relationships themselves. If your feelings for someone disappear when things go downhill, it means they were not strong in the first place. Weak things break easily. People want to leave relationships when they realize that things are not always pleasant. But nothing is always good. As they say, too much of a good thing is bad. I think it truly shows the value of your relationship\/love if it's always strong and you never leave that person. One of the most important things is to recognize the capacity for personal growth. Two unhealthy people can be in a relationship, and naturally it would be unhealthy, as well. But if they work to help each other and improve themselves, things turn out fine. So it's best not to abandon ship when things go bad or if they were bad from the start. Many things in life take patience, and this is one of them.\n  ","351144":"\n  When unhealthy, an individual more closely resembles a type whose functions are in a different order of their own but along the same axis. An unhealthy ISFP resembles an INTJ, for instance. The functions Fi-Se-Ni-Te thus become \"out of order,\" not literally but seemingly. The Fi and Se functions will appear shrouded by the Ni and Te functions, but if you set aside the person's unintentional type facade, you will recognize that they in fact use Fi and Se quite a lot. They are not pretending to be another type, they are just hyperfixating upon and employing the functions that make them feel less vulnerable. This applies to other types, as well. And you may wonder--if the ISFP's functions are Fi-Se-Ni-Te, why would they not resemble an ENTJ, whose functions are Te-Ni-Se-Fi (the exact opposite order), rather than an INTJ, whose functions are Ni-Te-Fi-Se? That is because the individual's focus does not change. Fi and Ni are both internally focused functions, but you do not simply begin focusing on the external when unhealthy. Instead, the focus is exacerbated, in a sense. So, functions do not \"turn inside out.\"\n  ","351145":"\n  Hm, I think consciousness means awareness. To be conscious of something is to be aware of it. To be self-conscious is to be aware of something (negative) about oneself. Consciousness, in other words, can be influenced by subjective perceptions. It's the same with reality. I would say that consciousness is more related to an individual themselves, while reality is all-encompassing. So consciousness on a greater scale, essentially. There is also a personal reality, however, which is created through previous experiences, mental illness, etc. If I hallucinate a bug, that is in my personal reality. I can tell someone that I saw a bug, but they would disagree, because they did not see one. The objective reality is that there was no bug, but if any of the five senses deceives you then your reality becomes a travesty. Reality is unchanging. It's objective and factual. However, we all have personal realities. For instance, if I was attacked by a dog in the past, I would likely carry around that experience and fear dogs themselves, or maybe even loathe them. Someone else would say that dogs are comforting, reliable, etc. My reality would be that dogs are awful, but because that person's experiences would be different, their reality would be the opposite. So anyone's reality is a result of their own past. But what is the true reality of the situation? Well, it would focus on the good and bad aspects of dogs. For instance, dogs may be loyal, enlivening, and so forth, but they are also high maintenance creatures--they require emotional attention, walks, baths, etc. There is a debate on whether all creatures have a conscience or not, but if we consider that consciousness is merely awareness of one's surroundings, I believe that all creatures do in fact have a conscience. They do not necessarily need a mind for this. A jellyfish has no brain, but it is conscious of its surroundings. If you are in its way, it will sting you. As long as you have the ability to sense your surroundings in some way (meaning at least one of your senses works), you are conscious. Someone who is asleep is considered unconscious, but if you disturb them, often they will wake up. Their consciousness does not disappear forever, unless they die.\n  ","351146":"\n  Hardly anything is genetic for me. No one in my family was\/is schizophrenic (or schizoaffective), yet I am. None of them had\/have OCD, either, but I do. My mental illnesses are not genetic, they are purely based on upbringing. Now, I do have some traits of both parents--I love solitude like my father, and I am very open and emotional like my mother. But these things are easily attributed to mental illness(es), as well. If we consider their personality types, I believe my father is an ISTJ and my mother is an INFP. So it would make sense for me (an ISFP) to have both Te and Fi functions, yet where did my Se and Ni come from? My (main) brother is on the same axis as me, with Se and Ni, so we get along well. But it shows that functions themselves may not be genetic. My parents have no artistic talents, but I am gifted at writing. They also fight all the time, but I hate any conflict and do all I can to avoid it. My upbringing has been one of fear and isolation. From the age of about 7 and onward, I stayed in one room all day, away from everyone, often writing endlessly. I do not write as much anymore, but I am just as isolated, if not more. I have very complex emotions, and that is my outlet for everything. I withdraw from anything that is unpleasant, whereas my parents engage in such things nonstop. They are quite close-minded and conservative, but I'm the very opposite. They were unable to impose their morals on me\/influence me much in that way. Ironically my father works as a behavior specialist but is very unstable, himself. I can relate to that sort of thing. Even when I was very unstable, I was able to assume a logical state and help others. We kind of shape shift, I guess. I'm quite the paranoid person due to my upbringing--I feared for my safety much of the time. It's gotten kind of better. I'm gentle and nurturing when you really get to know me. My mom is like that, since she had so many kids. But she did not tend to my emotional needs while I was growing up. My parents are the type to have a bunch of kids but then neglect them, because they're too focused on themselves and their issues with each other. I've had to solve my own problems--I even treated my eating disorder on my own. I love taking care of things, and I do not neglect them. Of course, I've never had a child, but I am sure I would be very caring and attentive to their needs. I would not let them live in the same environment I've had to live in, either--one of arguments, hostility, and at times actual violence. I'm a compromising person and a peacemaker. I want harmony in life, and for people to get along. I relish in friends being happy and peaceful. My parents are fairly destructive. I had an abundance of rage in the past, myself. I wanted to destroy. But unlike them, I've grown and improved. It's like they don't even care to change at all. They just stay miserable with each other, and make everyone else miserable in the process.\n  ","351147":"\n  Yes, I do believe that a person's name can impact their personality. Someone named Grace is usually very bubbly and likes sports, for instance. Someone named John is introverted and likes technology. I've only met two people with the same first name as me. I didn't know one of them well, so I couldn't say much about her. The other girl, she had my sun sign (Scorpio), but she was more outgoing. She was quite open about things--I am, as well, but online, not IRL.\n  ","351148":"\n  It's usually unproductive and pointless. It's not like saying \"Your acne is gross\" will get rid of someone's acne, for instance. I look down on people who insult others for things they cannot help.

But people shouldn't be bullied into getting surgery, you know?\n  ","351149":"\n  Lol, I took French for a few years in school, but I forgot most of it. I feel like the whole language education here really sucks. They should make you take it for longer so you don't forget it. I took Spanish in 5th grade, but I was very behind, because other students had taken it since kindergarten (my previous elementary school didn't teach any languages, and I went to that other one for only 5th grade). I was invited to join the French club in high school, but I didn't do it. I want to learn Latin in the future, because so many words are based on it.\n  ","351150":"\n  No, I'm not fluent. I just translate through French dictionaries and such. I have a copy of an official English translation of this book (someone sent it to me after I had already gotten decently far in my own translation), but it's pretty dated by now, and they leave out entire phrases, while also leaving whole poems untranslated. I translate absolutely everything, though, even Latin words.

I've been seeing her every week for years now. My psychiatrist treats me for psychotic symptoms and mood problems. He has suggested meds for my OCD, but I have declined. He also states that I have CPTSD. My therapist agrees with him. So they have very clear statements of what I have, but my parents refuse to get me officially diagnosed (since my mom got misdiagnosed in the past... she is paranoid). I couldn't get diagnosed before because I wasn't 18 yet (they're wary of diagnosing minors with more extreme illnesses). I'm an adult now, though, and still can't get diagnosed, so. But anyway, I've had symptoms since I was 13. I know it's probably considered early onset, but that's no surprise, because I had an early puberty. I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2017 and my therapist since 2018 (saw another therapist very briefly in 2017, but he sucked).\n  ","351155":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xo65v1kTRZA&ab_channel=wickedslicks1003\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351156":"\n  It's best to accept that there is no variety\/fun in life if no one takes any risks.

This states that it is bad to dramatically shift to things that make us uncomfortable, and instead we need gradual exposure which increases over time.\n  ","351157":"\n  Become a psychologist, publish a book, and explore the world. I have many small goals, too. As for these big goals, I'm nowhere close to becoming a psychologist (haven't even started college), I've written about 1\/3 of the book I intend to publish, and I have no money to travel yet. Oh, but I have some psychological experience from helping people online (plus I have my own disorders). So.\n  ","351158":"\n  Terrible. I forget important things people want me to remember, and even major events that have happened. Entire months are often wiped from my memory, but my short term memory is worst of all. I have a hard time remembering what I ate yesterday, what I was doing a few minutes ago, and so on. I forget what I've told people and what I haven't, so I probably repeat myself a lot.\n  ","351159":"\n  Evil Cheddar\n  ","351160":"\n  Yeah, when I was in middle school people were like \"There's something red on your face\" whenever I had a very noticeable pimple.

He correctly identified, for instance, that hallucinations are caused by guilt, through Macbeth's character. People have all these either convoluted or overly simplified assumptions about the cause of psychotic symptoms, but they are caused by guilt and shame, in reality. Sometimes just for existing, other times for actual actions (Macbeth's guilt was caused by his murders).\n  ","351163":"\n  Even if I change as a person, things do not magically disappear. I get irritated when a friend messages me every few months asking if that thing is \"gone.\" No, it's not, and it never will be. Same with my old therapist or my parents expecting my hallucinations to go away. It's been 5 years and I still have them. They just do not want to deal with me being screwed up.

There's rarely an in-between. I can't stand when people go \"I'm so OCD!\" because they like having a neat room or something. My OCD made me watch 27+ episodes of anime a day. I refused to hang out with friends because I needed to meet my episode quota. I get obsessive thoughts about contracting a disease simply by looking at blood IRL. It's quite insensitive for people to act like mental illnesses are just adjectives to throw around. And when people go on about the \"voices in their head,\" when really it's their internal dialogue. If I'm not on meds for my hallucinations, I hear multiple voices screaming at me at all times, see bugs where there are no bugs, see disturbing things like corpses, etc. Racing thoughts are also not \"voices.\" That's another thing, mentally ill people often act like they have domain over other mental illnesses and can incorporate their terminology. Anyway, people romanticize illnesses until they know what they are actually like.\n  ","351168":"\n  That's very true, as well. Many people find it difficult to \"be alone with themselves.\" They always need something or someone to distract them, otherwise they become unstable. Introverts naturally do more introspection, and they do not mind being alone with their hobbies, whereas extroverts want to share hobbies with others, and they are more sense-based\/risk taking. Also why they likely break CDC guidelines more.\n  ","351169":"\n  It's likely because you are voluntarily isolated, and it feels unpleasant when you're forced to be isolated. No one likes things being imposed on them, and they would rather make their own decisions. Quarantine isolation hasn't impacted me because I've always been extremely isolated. I hate leaving my house, much less my room. I'm rejoicing, if anything, because it means I do not have to physically go to school. I think other people dislike this forced isolation, though, because they experience loneliness. Someone may be introverted but have a few friends, for example, that they see at school or work, and quarantine takes that away from them. People cannot deal with total isolation unless they already have no friends and such. So, the main issues are losing control of your situation and possibly feeling lonely.\n  ","351170":"\n  I attribute my writing style primarily to mental illness. I often say that my writing improved as I became more schizophrenic, but when I reflect on it, I am a rather impressionistic person. By that I mean I can capture the essence of something without knowing much about it. I wrote several chapters of a story inspired by a game I had never even played. I rarely have psychotic episodes anymore, but my writing is more metaphorical and complex than ever, because it is harder to grasp something when it is actually impacting you, so to speak. It's the residue that stays with you. Psychology runs in my family (my father is a behavioral specialist, himself)--of course, mental illnesses do, as well. But no one in my family has\/had my illnesses (eating disorders also run in my family, however, and I used to have one, but I only have tendencies nowadays).\n  ","351171":"\n  I see, it's a shame the fathers are bad, but it's kind of you to pay for the children. That is true, but some more so than others. I tend to have compulsions rather than habits. Not everything is muscle memory, though. Most people could not draw with their eyes closed, for instance. Something like writing requires actual thinking rather than memory.\n  ","351172":"\n  I think people leave anyone who mistreats them. Sometimes you should, but sometimes you should stay, because people DO have the capacity to change. It depends on what you see happening in the future. Like, you might be in a manipulative and controlling relationship, but it may not always be that way. If someone lies to you, though, or talks badly about you behind your back, it's time to cut them off.\n  ","351173":"\n  It was hard to accept how I felt. I tried to hide it, because I thought my feelings would never be reciprocated. I \"confessed\" through saving certain pictures on Pinterest. They were quite blatant, but she did not understand. It took a lot to officially confess. It was an embarrassing confession, very dramatic. So, I initially confessed through images.\n  ","351174":"\n  A picture of one of my cats.\n  ","351175":"\n  I have some cute rabbit earrings. Here is one of them. The color is kind of coming off on the top, though. :\/\n  ","351176":"\n  I rarely draw anything, aside from my characters at times. I drew this, for instance. But I can't draw without a reference, lol. It's hard to find characters who look like mine. By characters I mean the ones from my stories. It's impossible to take a pic without my phone shadow in the way, rip.\n  ","351177":"\n  People are quick to not believe in things like zodiac signs and personality types because they \"put everyone in boxes,\" despite the fact that they use \"boxes\" in every day life. Book genres, clothing styles, political parties, etc. People identify with and take an interest in all sorts of boxes, yet have the audacity to complain about other boxes. It's hypocritical, in other words. Like, if you are an atheist, a Buddhist, a Muslim, etc., you identify with a box. Just accept that everyone is in multiple boxes at once. You aren't unique for wanting to \"get out of\" a box, because you are unknowingly in many others. If you like mystery novels over fantasy novels, that's an entire \"box\" you like over another. It's impossible to not fit into some sort of box. If you prefer Italian food over Chinese food, that's a box you've put yourself in. There are endless categories in life.\n  ","351178":"\n  Probably being too open about myself. People may think I'm very open here, but this isn't my final form, lol, it can be a lot worse. I give someone my entire life story if they simply ask for it. But I won't do it here, because of word limits, potential harassment, etc. Anyway, being so open has, as per the previous sentence, led to harassment--years of it, in fact. I know to be more private in public places, because in reality people will not simply appreciate someone being so open and frank, they will use the information against them. Not everyone is nice. Despite everything, I still consider myself to be quite open. I think it makes people feel more comfortable and like they can share, themselves. I want people to feel welcome and like they can tell me anything. Being open has caused people to mistake it for \"lacking self awareness,\" but I believe in optimal expression, and everything I do is very deliberate. I am TOO aware of myself, on the contrary, which is precisely why I have so much to share about myself. I KNOW so much about myself. It seems like they just project themselves on to me. Failures with no aspirations. I have countless goals, interests, and so forth.\n  ","351179":"\n  People have not died on the moon (at least, I cannot find anything to suggest they have). Space smells like metal and burnt material because of the astronauts' suits and gear. There are not corpses floating around in space, nor is there a rotten smell. Even if someone hypothetically died in space, their body would decompose\/disintegrate faster due to a build up of gas, which causes pressure. This pressure makes internal fluids spill out, and the body can even explode.\n  ","351180":"\n  My camera for film class was broken. I suspected I was simply winding the film incorrectly. The teacher said it was due by a certain day, otherwise we would get a 0, but I had a major history project due on the same day. In other words, I was expected to both do this project and go outside and take many photos on the same day. I had no time for that, so I cried even on the bus. My mom contacted the guidance counselor and explained the situation to the photography teacher, and he was understanding. In the end, I took pictures for that project about 3-4 times (keep in mind each film roll holds roughly 25 spaces for pictures, so we're talking about 75-100 pictures). But the problem wasn't the film or developing but the camera itself. The teacher never gave me an F, despite never turning that project in. And when I finally developed the pictures, school was out because of the coronavirus. While we were all away, a janitor came and threw my film away.\n  ","351181":"\n  I have a hard time identifying what I feel anxious about, but I would say failure makes me most anxious, in the sense that it triggers my OCD, which is anxiety based. This is why when I was physically in school, I had various compulsions, such as a checking compulsion to make sure my phone hadn't fallen out of my bag, and obsessive thoughts about blood. But when I am not physically in school, my obsessions and compulsions are minor, if not nonexistent. I'm scared to go to college because it will likely trigger things all over again.\n  ","351182":"\n  Hm, I definitely seek solace in my lover, I feel like she knows just what to say to make me feel better. I'm used to feeling like everything is falling apart, though, so I just focus on my own aspirations and what I can control. After all, there is no sense in expending energy on things that cannot be controlled. People often talk about having a \"comfort show\" or \"comfort movie\" and such, and I think it's important to have something like that to fall back on. I've never really had that sort of thing, but I think Omori is my comfort game (as of a few days ago). It's something to get your mind off of how upset you feel. I think everyone should practice meditation, as well, to ground themselves and forget about external stressors, though I admittedly haven't indulged in it much yet. I try not to catastrophize things, because otherwise I feel overwhelmed. That can be accomplished through recognizing the catastrophic thoughts and changing them.\n  \n  As for self harm, I would not call it moral nor immoral, so it can't be acceptable or unacceptable. It is what it is. I think everyone self harms to a degree, whether it be as major as physical mutilation or as minor as a caffeine addiction. But doing anything that is bad for you could be considered self harm. Eating junk food versus healthy food, undermining your worth, mistreating your hair, scratching yourself, biting your nails, etc. Of course, there are also arguments over what the \"self\" encompasses, but I believe it is both your inner self and appearance. That is, something like not practicing personal hygiene is self harm because your body is part of yourself. People resort to different forms of self harm depending on how they feel, but you cannot police someone's emotions. I do not think leaving actual scars from self harm is a good idea, but when someone is in that suicidal mindset, they become trapped in the present and neglect the future. But self harm cannot be unacceptable, because everyone has bodily autonomy.\n  ","351183":"\n  My lover did some sacrificial things for me. She admitted to something socially unacceptable about herself so people would give negative attention to her rather than me. I couldn't stand up for myself, so she defended me all the time. She also visited me (from states away) when I was very suicidal. She gives me gifts without me asking for them. Reading anything bad written about me drives me unstable, so at the height of me being harassed, she read everything, to protect me, even at the expense of her own health (because reading these things made her unstable, too). I'm not so sure about other people doing selfless things for me. People don't really help me or do things for me unless I explicitly ask them to.\n  ","351184":"\n  Sometimes I am too open about things, and it has been detrimental. I try to suppress myself more nowadays. I'm not sure if I would have done things differently, though. If not for being open about a certain thing, I doubt my lover (who was at the time just a stranger, of course) would have talked to me to begin with. I regret not trusting my instinct more and befriending people who I suspected would come to betray me (and yes, they did indeed come to betray me). I tend to hope for the best in people and try not to assume the worst, but at times it's necessary to assume the worst. I wish I did not continue talking to them. I also regret not being more expressive about things that upset me. This lack of assertion has caused people to walk all over me, and for me to simply tolerate it. I need to work on setting boundaries and telling people that being mean to me is unacceptable. I regret not taking meds sooner. My delusions and mania (as well as headaches from my concussion) caused me to be quite homicidal, and those careless homicidal rants have made people see me in a bad light, despite the fact that it has been years since I've acted that way. I wish I did not type so much that I injured my wrists. I need more self-preservation.\n  ","351185":"\n  This.\n  ","351186":"\n  My childhood has been one of emotional and physical neglect, as well as psychological abuse, regular harassment, sexual harassment, and abandonment from those I've cared about. I witnessed my father abuse and later try to kill my mother. My mother threatened to overdose and die in front of me (when I was ten). I have isolated myself all my life to get away from them constantly yelling at each other. My health has been neglected for years--I was supposed to get an MRI (and most likely surgery) on my wrists years ago, but it never happened, so I've been in pain every day. When I expressed suicidal thoughts at the age of ten, I was merely hugged, not taken to a professional. I have been depressed and suicidal ever since, and I was not taken to anyone until I explicitly mentioned I had to, despite showing symptoms of derealization, psychosis, etc., for months. My father laughed when I talked about having hallucinations, like it's something funny. He's a pathological liar and aggressive alcoholic. We have always had money problems, and I lose health insurance every now and then. One time my parents' bank accounts were even in the negative digits. My mother was fired from her job due to being disabled, and my father had two jobs but lost one of them. He doesn't make much money anymore--we've had to rely on food trucks and such. It takes my parents a long time to treat bug infestations. I had to practically beg them to get help for a fruit fly infestation. I've had a carpet beetle problem in my room for years. There was a beetle\/tiny bug infestation in the pantry and overall house for months, if not a year. The beetles got in our food. I would be eating a Poptart and randomly see a beetle crawling on it. And I could go on....\n  ","351187":"\n  I think believing you have a chemical imbalance (assuming you believe that, since many do, despite hardly any evidence supporting it) encourages you to feel helpless against your depression, and like you are just sick and cannot be cured. But it tends to be a perception issue--\"My life is horrible,\" \"I hate myself,\" \"No one loves me,\" etc. If you can identify the negative thoughts you have, write them down, and make them positive, then adopt those positive thoughts, you will feel better. \"Fake it until you make it\" works best for depression.\n  ","351188":"\n  No problem, I enjoy reading your posts, and thank you for liking my page.\n  \n  I think people mistakenly believe that happiness and elation are the same, but to me happiness is a feeling of contentment, or peace. Peace with oneself, peace with others, peace with totality, and peace with one's life in general. There are four energy forces which I have recognized--the force to your own body, the force to your peers, the force to where you live (Earth itself, if you think of it on a greater scale), and the force to the universe. When one of these is off balance, there is a lack of peace. For instance, if the force to yourself is greater than the force to any of those other things, this may manifest as self-loathing, narrow-mindedness, narcissism, etc. Anything negatively related to the self (now, it can just be a single thing or many things). Excessive force to others would manifest as a desire for validation, a desire to never be alone, an interest in gossip\/drama, etc. Excessive force to the universe manifests as extreme religiosity, irrational conspiracy theories, etc. Excessive force to the world you live in manifests as the inability to be imaginative (too grounded in reality), feeling overwhelmed and stressed all the time (too much emphasis on obligations), giving up on aspirations, etc. There has to be a healthy balance of all of these things to create genuine happiness. An example of that: Self-love, kindness toward others (and peace in solitude), productivity (but not overworking yourself or losing sight of your dreams), and a healthy interest in things such as astrology, spirituality (does not necessarily have to be religion... I wouldn't consider myself to be religious), astronomy, and\/or other \"fantastical\" or \"far away\" things. Too much emphasis on a single part of your life leads to an imbalance and thus sadness, paranoia, guilt, etc.\n  \n  Am I happy, not most of the time. There is a force imbalance in my life. I hate this and that about myself, and have self-deprecating thoughts. I'm also too people pleasing and have a hard time setting boundaries. I'm not happy about my health. My wrists hurt if I type too much. My back and neck hurt because of low vitamin D and bad posture. I get random pain in my arms, fingers, knees, ankles, and so on. I'm not sure why. Any criticism upsets me greatly. I wish I did not take things so personally. I perceive small things as attacks when they are likely not attacks--and when it comes to real attacks, I spiral and have a breakdown.\n  \n  I hope that learning more about Buddhism and practicing it--not as a religion but as a science\/teaching (it cannot quite be considered a philosophy because it does not deal with basic metaphysical questions)--will help me eliminate suffering in life and finally become happy.\n  ","351189":"\n  Because children believe in the existence of things that do not exist, such as Santa, since their parents lie to them by saying that those things exist (OR their peers believe in those things and pass the belief on). I would not lie to my children. Their friends can try to tell them that unicorns or Santa exist, but I will tell them that they do not, simply. I don't see it as \"magical\" to tell children that those things exist, I see it as deceptive.\n  ","351190":"\n  Hm, perhaps you are an ENFP? Just based on similar functions. It wouldn't be realistic to be an INTP if you prioritize Fi, seeing as how Fi is the INTP's demon (essentially the function they do not value whatsoever). My demon function is Ti, meaning I do not understand why people use that function at all, or how they can even bear it. As such, I hate things like physics with a passion. It also depends on which function other people perceive you as failing in. Considering Ne is my 7th function, I struggle with interpreting things correctly a lot of the time. I think someone is speaking to me in a malicious tone when they are not, and go on blocking sprees. Someone with high Ne, on the other hand, would say something like \"The possibilities are endless\" (regarding life philosophy), and abide by that in a healthier way. I hate hypotheticals, and when I bother to think of them, they are delusional hypotheticals, if that makes sense (ex: what if this obese YouTuber is actually wearing a fat suit and is truly very skinny?... Yes, that's an actual consideration of mine). Now, if you are an INTP, that would mean you struggle to use Se in a healthy way. You can become detached from reality and act insensitive without knowing it. If you are an ENFP, that would be Ti. That manifests as indecision and issues with having arguments be consistent and logically sound. You may sound convincing from Fi, but what you say lacks verifiable substance. You are blind to evidence. An INFP would struggle with Se, much like an INTP--but like an ISFP (myself), they do not care about Ti, and even demonize people who utilize it. I made a post the other day about how I hate when people use the phrase \"self truth,\" for example. That is me demonizing people with Ti. I can't stand it when people suggest facts and the truth can possibly be subjective.\n  \n  So, I would suggest determining which function you demonize in other people. An INTP would demonize those who use Fi, seeing personal values as useless, as well as absolute self-expression. Fi, after all, focuses on expressing itself to its greatest abilities. As someone with dominant Fi, I go against language conventions in my writing, using verbs as nouns and such. Someone with dominant Fi does not care if what they do is seen as unconventional or even controversial. They just want to express themselves. An INTP would be more rigid and look down upon that sort of thing.\n  \n  But also keep in mind that people can mistake type 4 for Fi. If you have 4 in your tritype, it can resemble Fi, especially if it is a primary type (that is, not a wing). While those with Fi and those who are type 4 can both be idealistic and prioritize self expression above everything, 4 is more about appearances than Fi. Fi does not care about how it is perceived from the outside, but a type 4 person wants to be seen as unique.\n  ","351191":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Hx3U9072f38&ab_channel=LantisGlobalChannel\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351192":"\n  Hey, I'm sorry for the late response. Do you mean your friend is the one who forgot everything, or your friend commented on a post about someone else who forgot? I assume the first one, but the wording could be interpreted either way, so I'm not sure. It's understandable to want to help someone, and to worry about them. Being in another country can make you feel helpless. You wish you had more control over the situation. But just remember, there are other people caring for this girl (your friend?). So while you cannot be there for her in person, other people are. Don't dwell too much on things you have no control over, because dwelling doesn't give you more control, it only makes you lose control (of yourself). If you feel very anxious, I would recommend grounding techniques--saying something you taste, something you smell, etc. Worry about what you can do, not what you can't. What you can do is make yourself feel better.\n  ","351193":"\n  There is, to me, no such thing as \"self truths,\" only the objective truth. If two people give opposing stories about something, the truth isn't \"somewhere in between.\" One of them is telling the truth, simply. If peron A's car was crashed into, that is the objective truth. If the person who crashed their car into the other person's car (person B) insists that person A was in fact the one who crashed into THEM, that is not a \"self truth,\" that is a lie. But this is hard for people with the Ti function to understand. They find everything to be subjective when it isn't. If an apple falls on your head, that's the objective truth. Someone can say it didn't happen, or that it was actually a pear. And that is not a self truth. There is no such thing. It's just a fancy way of saying you're a liar, or that you misinterpreted things.\n  ","351194":"\n  (This is directed at random people... just a rant)\n  \n  I think it's unfair for anyone to see Shakespeare's writing as pretentious. He wrote for the common man, meaning not the upperclass. Of course, his plays were difficult to understand at times even for the common man, because he created many of his own words, which are still used today. But that was how people spoke at the time. It is like taking a random book of this time period and saying it's pretentious 400 or so years from now, just because English has advanced past that way of speaking. English has become overly simplified, but you have to take into account how the language was back then, and see Shakespeare's works from the perspective of the time period. Just because English sucks so much now and you cannot understand his writing doesn't make it pretentious. He wasn't writing for highly intelligent people. You will not, however, find very similar writing to his, precisely because he invented words and wrote in iambic pentameter. I find both of these things to be impressive.\n  ","351195":"\n  All the time. I get weird speech issues from my schizophrenia and forget what I was going to say in the middle of saying it, or have a confusing\/disconnected way of speaking. Yesterday our washing machine stopped working and flooded the floor. I meant to ask if I could shower and still put my dirty clothes in the laundry (to go in the washing machine). But instead I asked if I could use the washing machine, which made it sound like I was going to be the one doing the laundry. And I just stopped in the middle of saying something, not sure how to end the sentence. I try to be careful with what I say, otherwise I get the wrong thing across. But this carefulness gives people the wrong idea and makes them think I don't have a speech issue. I really do, I struggle to talk.\n  ","351196":"\n  It has helped my OCD, and my relationship is in the best condition it's ever been in. I of course have some complaints, like about not being able to go to the amusement park or have a proper vacation. I was in a very shitty state before school got out in March, but I don't think I've self harmed since then. So 2020 is the year I stopped (physically) harming myself, and my mental and relationship state have both improved.\n  ","351197":"\n  Not going to college sounds like one of those things. Or dropping out of high school. I like the idea of marriage, because weddings seem beautiful. I know some people say it's \"just a piece of paper,\" but it's also more convenient on taxes and such. You will also get questioned if you never marry your partner. It's awkward to have a house and kids together but not be married, I think.\n  ","351198":"\n  I'll translate and maybe do homework. I also want to finish Omori. I was playing it for hours today.\n  ","351199":"\n  I think it depends on the location. Of course you should not set off fireworks around many trees, for instance. But if it's just a grassy field, or even concrete, I don't see how it'd harm animals much. As for the environment, fireworks do emit greenhouse gases, but it's also not like they're being set off every day of the year. It's better for many people to gather together and watch fireworks (NOT during the coronavirus), so they are not individually setting many off. There is less damage that way.\n  ","351200":"\n  Uh... I have a hard time telling someone if they made me sad, so I ghost them. I also interpret many things as being attacks against me, so I block people who probably weren't even saying anything mean. Like, if they have a passive aggressive tone of voice, I block them. People have to talk in a very gentle tone of voice to me or I will feel depressed or paranoid. I'm also jealous in love. I used to be pretty controlling. I'm still controlling when it comes to things such as group projects, and can be domineering. When I'm in a good mood, I become insensitive and have little patience for people's complaints. I do not care about giving them sympathy and perceive them as whiny. I feel guilty over minor things, mostly things that are not even my fault.\n  ","351201":"\n  Pretty good. I love solitude and hate going outside, so quarantine has been great for me. My compulsions from OCD are not bothering me much; physically being in school would trigger them again and again. The first three or so months of 2020 were terrible. There were some terrible days after those months, as well, but overall 2020 has not been the worst year for me.\n  ","351202":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=heC18eqDLT8&ab_channel=KubzScouts\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351203":"\n  All the time. I often know who sends things based on how they talk, or if they like the response to that question. But I know the like thing isn't always reliable, because people might just see that answer on their feed and like it without being associated with the question. However, how they talk on their page is usually how they talk in questions, so I can put the two together that way. I do lurk on people's pages sometimes to make these patterns. Anyway, sometimes I'm too lazy to lurk, so I don't always know. The best indication is emoji use. I pick up on the emojis people like to use.\n  ","351204":"\n  I don't think it's that bad for most people. Definitely painful, but it goes away. I think it triggered my schizophrenic symptoms, though (there is evidence to show that head injuries can cause hallucinations). And it greatly impaired my memory. I don't remember much of anything from 2019, and my short term memory is the worst. It also made me become homicidal for a long time, because the headaches drove me crazy. I still get those headaches, but not as often.\n  ","351205":"\n  No problem.

Relationships naturally come with pain and conflict, as well as some degree of emotional reliance. Many people also hate commitment, so they're quick to leave a relationship if their partner wants it to be serious. Many people also seem to not want a meaningful relationship, instead wanting one for validation and the appeasement of loneliness.\n  ","351208":"\n  Here is one of them.\n  ","351209":"\n  Because people are selfish in different ways, whether it be monetarily selfish, selfish with belongings, selfish with friends, etc. They aren't selfish in all realms of life. But I would say there is always a motive with helping others, whether it be learning more about humans themselves, making yourself feel or look better, having people be indebted to you, etc.\n  ","351210":"\n  Eh, it depends on if you mean jealousy or envy. People use the terms interchangeably, but they mean different things. Envy is wanting something you can't have--I think materialism encourages this emotion. People often assume others are better off than they are, but that's usually not true. So I would say it's also a misunderstanding. As for jealousy, it means you are afraid that what you have will be taken away. People naturally fear abandonment, so jealousy isn't unusual, especially if you have worked hard to get what you have.\n  ","351211":"\n  My mom got mad at me for drinking Sunny D one time... claimed that it's an emergency drink for if grocery stores shut down. But the stores aren't going to shut down. She buys things in a panic and blames us for using what she buys. They become expired because no one is allowed to use them. It's her problem for participating in the panic buying phenomenon. And plus it's Sunny D. She could have a child who drinks alcohol, but instead she has one who drinks Sunny D. It's not something to get mad about. She's lucky I'm not someone who drinks alcohol, vapes, etc. She should be more grateful. As for other things, there was an entire fight (not with my mom) over me writing a certain line in an essay, which was only a placeholder. I was going to go back and change it. I was threatened over it, and it wasn't even a final draft.\n  ","351212":"\n  Yeah, anything to make themselves feel better, and to get people to sympathize with them and take their side. They just get away with everything like that. It's sad. You're better off not bothering with it at all. Try to disconnect yourself as much as possible. They are just desperate for gossip, and by responding to it you feed into it more. Not that NOT responding makes it any better. It never made anything better for me, but it brings me more peace of mind.\n  ","351213":"\n  It's online, not in real life. Older people act as if it's as simple as blocking the person, but it isn't. Blocking doesn't change the things they say about you, the things they can do to you. It's just censorship, but not an effective form. I had to leave the site I used entirely because it got so bad. Then I got doxxed months after leaving. No interaction with people (minor interaction with friends, though). You can't escape what happens. I have CPTSD because it's an ongoing nightmare. As for why it happens--rumors, projections, etc. They will try to destroy your life without it being warranted. And they'll make you out to be the perpetrator, the harasser, when it's them. It's awful. I'm an extremely conflict-averse person, so it's even worse for me.\n  ","351214":"\n  A support system. It doesn't necessarily have to come from a lover, nor a family member, nor a friend. It can be anyone, even a cat. Whatever makes you feel better when you're upset or stressed. Whatever keeps you stable and makes you happy. That's more important than money. Yes, money provides financial support, but it cannot provide the same emotional support. It won't defend you from cruelty, it won't console you after something tragic happens (unless you decide to go on a shopping spree, I guess), it won't make you feel less alone, it won't understand you, etc. It is just paper, plastic cards, coins, and numbers, at the end of the day.\n  ","351215":"\n  I see, that sounds difficult to deal with...

In the past I spent hours writing very long messages to people in order to help them with suicidal thoughts and such, but because I typed so much, I ended up injuring my wrists. It's been three years and my parents have never taken me to get surgery for them, so I can't type as much anymore, and thus can't help people like I used to.\n  ","351223":"\n  Hm... I'll never be religious, haha. I think people tend to think in extremes--they either believe in an afterlife or not. I do not believe in one, but I think reincarnation is a sort of middle ground there. I don't think people become other creatures, such as dogs or horses. Rather, they start a new human life, in which they learn new lessons. These lessons are passed on with each life, until they reach their full individual potential\/wisdom. Anyway, I am an atheist, but I agree with the Buddhist philosophy. I don't practice it as a religion, but the philosophical teachings are nice. The Buddhist concept of reincarnation differs from mine in that humans can become various animals, from what I understand. Buddhism is commonly seen as a religion devoid of any diety, but there are in fact minor dieties in it. I don't believe in a diety, afterlife, or the concept of sins and such. Those things are restrictive and assume that you are dependent and pathetic. Like \"Here's a moral code for you to abide by.\" No, I am purely an individual, with my own set of morals and path to growth and happiness. I don't care if people think I'm going to burn in hell for being in a same sex relationship.

In the manga there is a scene on a bridge, rather than that roof, and it's more expanded. But essentially Yashiro commits crimes because he likes to observe Satoru's fighting spirit. He is used to people giving up, but Satoru is an exception, and thus fills the hole in his heart. I don't remember the whole thing about the cancer patient very well, but it's probably a last attempt at getting Satoru's attention. Knowing Yashiro can't live without him, Satoru threatens to commit suicide. Yashiro falls for it, and the police come to arrest him. In the manga (at the park place), Yashiro lures a girl to a building, but Satoru predicts what he will do beforehand and teams up with Kenya to get him. Yashiro and Satoru meet on a bridge, which Yashiro sets on fire. Satoru tackles him and they fall in the water beneath the bridge. Yashiro ends up getting arrested because there is evidence of attemped murder with that girl.\n  ","351226":"\n  Eh, as long as my intentions are good, I don't think much of it.

I would be friends with a cannibal but not a Trump supporter, lol. I like anyone who is interesting, but I don't like liars, hateful people, those who are unloyal, etc. As for me, I don't do much that could be considered wrong, unless people have a problem with the porn I'm into.

Pleasantries are so annoying, I wish society would do away with them already. \"How are you?\" \"Good.\" No, you're not well, shut up. \ud83d\ude2a It's not even grammatically correct, either.

My lifestyle of never going outside and thus having a vitamin D deficiency is, to me, unnatural. Taking supplements shows that something about my life is unnatural. So, I think any diet that requires you to take supplements is not good. Supplements mean you are missing something that could otherwise be achieved, if you had the right diet\/lifestyle\/whatever. I'm aware that people don't always need supplements (with these diets), but I would say a majority of them do. If you simply dislike meat, okay. But these people tend to have some savior complex. \"I'm saving animals!\" No, and eating meat is not animal abuse, because the animal is already dead, and you have no direct contact with it while it's alive (unless you are a farmer, yourself). It's just like saying that using paper is killing trees--news flash, the trees are dead, and paper is evidence of that. Anyway, the whole moral elitist aspect of it is very off-putting.

A relationship that is full of encouragement, reassurance, independence, acceptance, trust, etc., is one of order, because it provides growth and stability. Having order in life means feeling you are in control, and being disorganized means feeling out of control. A relationship in which both people (or all, if it's a polygamous relationship, I guess) support each other and are on the same page brings a sense of order, but if there is no support and the people in the relationship have different motives, it's disorganized.\n  \n  Now, love is a culmination of various feelings, rather than an individual feeling. Love can make people become jealous and controlling (scenario of chaos relationship), or it can make people become nurturing and stable (scenario of order relationship). Thus it depends on the accompanying emotions. But I believe relationships can be bred from chaos and become healthy, or they can be bred from order but become chaotic. I believe that people are quick to leave a relationship if they consider it toxic, but not all toxic relationships stay toxic forever. Because a toxic relationship means that someone, or both people, or all people, in that relationship is\/are unhealthy. They have the capacity to become healthy, if they so choose. But if they never do, the relationship stays toxic, or chaotic.\n  \n  Love can drive some people mad and unstable. They want to know what their partner is doing at all times, they want to protect their partner from the perils of the world, and so on. But love can also make people happy, and provide a support system. Love can make you gain confidence in yourself and learn to thrive. Love can deplete all life, or it can bring life. This is because love has a dual nature. It is both birthing and murderous.\n  \n  An unhealthy person's love can be ruinous, while a healthy person's love can inspire improvement and maturation. But things are not always so rigid: people are not always healthy or always unhealthy. This is how love can be ruinous at one point and inspire improvement\/maturation at another.\n  ","351240":"\n  Yeah, here's one of them.\n  ","351241":"\n  Carve and Awkward by Dance Gavin Dance, My Girlfriend by Lil Xan (but I love all his songs), Nine Is God and My Head Hurts by Wavves, And I Love Her by The Beatles, Raging on a Sunday by Bohnes, Strip The Soul by Porcupine Tree, Dirty Little Secret by The All-American Rejects, title track by Machine Gun Kelly, 21st Century Liability by Yungblud, Secret's Safe With Me by Weathers, Out of Style by The Wrecks, Blossom by Coletta, Shot Caller by Hella Sketchy, Private Life by Oingo Boingo, Godlike by KMFDM, Territorial Pissings by Nirvana, Identity by grandson, Gone by Paris Shadows, Dead Inside by Younger Hunger, Perfect Day by Lou Reed, uh....\n  ","351242":"\n  I see, that makes sense.

Such as, if you are gay and have very homophobic parents, it's not safe to tell them about your sexuality. But maybe if they change, you could tell them. Or tell someone who seems more supportive. People should weigh the pros and cons before revealing something. As for the right way... well, it should be peaceful. I don't think it's good to tell someone something major in the middle of an argument, for instance.\n  ","351244":"\n  Some people see themselves as too cowardly and submissive to have their own beliefs. They need some higher power to do everything for them. To me it's a sign of weakness.

That'd just be a facade. People here can be quite rude and stuck in their ways (regarding traditions). I'd say it can be a rather stagnant society.

It's the opposite here, people get offended if you are unkind, and will tell you to smile. Sometimes I have been walking on the street or going to a store and random people have told me to smile.

And please do not ask anything food related. I do not understand why you would ask someone about food, knowing they either have or once had an eating disorder. It comes across as insensitive.\n  \n  I also do not enjoy all the prying. I am not some answering machine. I am a human being, and I have boundaries and things I would prefer to not talk about. I do not like being spammed with questions, either. I remember saying (at one point) that it would be nice to get spammed, but it isn't nice, in reality. I do not need to be questioned about every little remark I make. Not everything has to be made into a new thread.\n  \n  I do not appreciate my openness being taken advantage of.

Then I remembered Joe Biden fangirls follow me on TikTok, and they've posted videos of a sort of deepfake of Biden skating, lol. So I made a gif out of one of those videos, added text to it, and submitted it. I also did some English work.

Strangely it has been all the children between my mother and father. They both had their own children before getting together (my father has an ex-wife and my mother has an ex-husband). So, of my non-half siblings, all have\/had an eating disorder. My sister was anorexic, but not anymore. I have had anorexic tendencies for years. My brother is very picky and only eats unhealthy food--he kind of has a binge eating problem. I have a trans brother who used to have a binge eating problem but is now a vegetarian and does not eat much. However, the tendencies are still there.\n  ","351254":"\n  Here is a picture of one of my cats. I've mostly done homework today, and no one wants to see that, so.\n  ","351255":"\n  Yes. I believe in what I call true devotion. I do not support the idea of having a second or third (and I could go on) partner in life. That is, you can never be in more than one relationship throughout your lifetime. You can never have sex with more than one person, either. If you break up with your partner\/if they break up with you, you can never move on from them. If they die, you can never move on, either. They are your one and only, forever. This is how I am, at least. I have no ex. I will never have a future relationship, only the one I'm in. But I am with my soulmate. I am forever hers. There is no such thing as fleeting love, in my opinion. There is love and there is infatuation. Infatuation is temporary, but love is permanent. My love will last forever. If you can move on from someone, it means you never truly loved them. I know my idea of true devotion is idealistic. There are some factors that could impede it, after all--what if someone dated a person when they were young and regretted the relationship (does it even count at that age)? What if they believed they found their soulmate but realized this was not the case? And well, I still believe your first relationship should be your last. You need the proper intuition\/insight to know who your soulmate is, too. Your lover also cannot have a previous lover--that would be evidence that their devotion is superficial. You both have to exclusively belong to each other. When I came to hold this belief... I think I was 14? I developed feelings for my lover (at the time, we were not together yet). I thought that even if she never loved me back, I would want only her forever. She did end up loving me back, but I maintained this view. Yes, I will always think this way. And in case anyone asks, no, this is not about \"waiting until marriage.\" I do not believe in that stuff. You only have to wait until you meet your soulmate. Also, I am not imposing my belief in true devotion on other people. I understand that everyone has their own definition of what it means to be devoted. This is mine, simply. It would be nice if other people felt the same way, but I know they would see this as unrealistic.\n  ","351256":"\n  From what I have read, conspiracy theorists are more likely to have schizotypal traits. And if we take into consideration common schizophrenic and schizotypal delusions, one of them is the belief in mind control. People themselves create these theories, and given the prevalence of the mind control delusion, it makes sense for conspiracy theories to revolve around control in general.\n  ","351257":"\n  Hm, I wonder. I'm very used to sharing with people. I did it for about two years before, but I took a long break from talking to them (roughly a year long break). I readily share my entire life story if someone asks for it. I'm not a secretive person online. That's why I've gotten harassed--I'm too open. I've done it many times, so it means little to me (in the grand scheme of things). But after taking such a long break, it's nice to do it again.\n  ","351258":"\n  I'll try to answer your three points on morality here.\n  \n  What you say about slavery is true, but the purpose of enslavement in nature is different. Yes, a parasite can take control of its host, but it does that to survive. When we consider slavery among humans, slaves are used for labor. In nature, animals do what they must to survive: their primary goals are to find food and reproduce. Humans have more complex goals. Do they share the same goals as other creatures, yes. But other creatures are not concerned with currency, for instance. Certain creatures would die if they could not take control of a host. But people will not die without slavery, you know? That is the difference. Now, we can of course have the discussion of ALL humans being slaves, in a sense. Slaves to the media, to the government, etc. But when I talk of slavery, I mean it in a literal sense--that of forced labor. And yes, I agree that morality is instilled upon people at birth. But they are also capable of producing their own morals, independent of influence. My parents, for instance, are rather homophobic people (and deem homosexuality immoral), but I am quite the opposite of that. I am in a same sex relationship. They also believe abortion is immoral, but I do not. And I could go on. You do not have to be majorly influenced by your parents, but many people are.\n  \n  When I mentioned humans being more intelligent than other creatures, I meant they have an expansion of perceptions, ideas, etc. They can invent a variety of things. They have greater necessities. They require more developmental attention (think: schooling). They have more responsibilities. They can run, jump, dance, do cartwheels, swim, and even fly. This is because they can make so many devices--and how? Their knowledge and intellect. Yes, some animals are notably intelligent, undoubtedly. And I would not say morality is \"intelligent.\" But I believe it prevents chaos. Morality breeds laws. Many laws are unreasonable, but others are of significance. Human nature is not exactly benevolent, thus there would be crimes upon crimes. Murder, torture, looting, etc. Eh, I would not consider cloning or the use of stem cells to be immoral, personally. I'm not the morality police, though.\n  ","351259":"\n  Hm... regarding letting my feelings out, yes. I have no real outlet other than writing. I'm not the type to, say, punch a pillow when I'm mad. I just keep it inside. That's why writing is so important for me. Do I find writing to be the most relaxing thing, no. Probably playing games\/watching videos, instead. When I first became truly aware of my emotions, I began writing. It has been crucial for me during times of contemplating suicide. The first time I contemplated it was when I was around 10, I remember. Back then I wrote in journals, using them as a sort of diary.\n  ","351260":"\n  I get quite annoyed when they victimize themselves. \"Addiction is a disease\" Uh, okay, but you chose to do drugs in the first place. If addiction runs in your family then it's even more reason to not touch drugs. People are fucking dumb, though. They like to blame mental illnesses but I'm mentally ill and have never done drugs. It's just bad decision making on their part. I wouldn't say I hate them, but I do not feel bad for them, either.\n  ","351261":"\n  Hm, I haven't heard of it. But it's an antidepressant, so no wonder. I've helped myself with my OCD, and suppressed my eating disorder when it was at its worst. I get too tired of living with that stuff to let it continue to the same degree. I know I am often anxious, but I have a hard time identifying that I am. It's strange. I wonder how you can become more comfortable with change....\n  ","351262":"\n  I do not have an interesting background. I am not very familiar with it, actually, because it serves no particular relevance to my life. I know I have some Irish blood, as well as some Native American blood, but these are somewhat distant things. You could not determine either of them from my appearance, I mean.\n  ","351263":"\n  Well, I'm not in the mood to give a major analysis on anyone right now, but I'll try to give an analysis, nonetheless.\n  \n  You seem like the type of person to have intense and long-lived obsessions. People can often be separated into obsession length groups. It indicates the use of Si on your part. Based on your use of Si, I presume you are the sentimental type. You appreciate practicality and store many facts and bits of information. Kind of like a walking encyclopedia, that type of person. You have strong opinions on things and make objective decisions. You have high standards in life. You value personal space and solitude. You are serious and responsible, and you honor promises. You have great concentration and are a reliable friend. You are cautious and appear calm during crises. You are very detail-oriented, perhaps even stubborn. You can be perceived as cold by others, as well as neglectful, and must explicitly express your feelings, otherwise they will not understand. You attach special value to past experiences, and may recount the same story multiple times. You tend to be nostalgic and can recall things in vidid detail, despite how long ago they happened. You can relive past experiences not only for the sake of nostalgia but for fact-checking purposes. You are always being reminded of things--\"Oh, that dog is similar to one I had in the past!\" You may often have a confused yet resolute expression. There is a dull feeling about your eyes, because you are lost in thought much of the time, not placing a particular focus on your environment. Your internal world is most immersive. You have a steady stare. It may seem as if you are often scowling. Your head makes unusual movements when you speak--your neck may jerk backward or forward. There is thus a certain sway to your body.\n  \n  But if I got the Si part wrong, this whole thing could be wrong... anyway, it is an analysis based on an individual function. There are others to take into account.\n  ","351264":"\n  Yeah, you must've used the unreliable 16Personalities site. The whole -T and -A thing is nonexistent in actual MBTI. That awful site gives the INFJ result out like Halloween candy, but in reality few people are INFJs. I would not really recommend taking any MBTI tests online, just reading about the functions. Tests always claim I'm an INTJ or ISTJ, but I'm an ISFP, so.\n  ","351265":"\n  Hm, I'd say both are at fault, to an extent. It's unrealistic to believe everyone will disappoint you. It's rather egocentric to assume everyone will betray you, everyone will lie to you, etc. There are many honest and loyal people out there, and it is unfair to group them in with everyone else. You become very close-minded, assuming everyone is out to get you. And that you are important enough for them to WANT to betray you and such. I wouldn't say their expectations are high, unless the disappointment concerns something minuscule. They are just delusional, in the case of disappointment meaning betrayal. But yes, sometimes people's expectations are too high, and anyone who does not meet\/exceed those expectations is disappointing. Other people are at fault for disappointing this person in the past, certainly. That is assuming the disappointment was realistic.\n  \n  It's hard to think of an example... but let's say you make a friend in class, and you ask them to give you the homework answers, then they refuse. That's a disappointment. You make another friend, and they, too, refuse to give you the homework answers. That's another disappointment. You adopt the belief that everyone will disappoint you and not give you the answers. In this case, you are expecting people to help you get away with not doing the homework. It isn't their fault for making you do the work, yourself. It's your fault for not doing it.\n  ","351266":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WwO8Qv6aqBQ&ab_channel=EqualVisionRecords\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351267":"\n  I initially had a very literal style of writing. It was straightforward and not difficult to understand. However, as my hallucinations and delusions worsened, my manner of thinking became more metaphorical. I had to change my style of writing to match how I perceived the world. It was first made evident in the last chapters of a story I wrote. People enjoy that story because it is simple, but near the end I started using more metaphors. The book I'm currently writing is highly metaphorical. The first chapters are less so, because I was still becoming accustomed to this new style. The metaphors and complex vocabulary perhaps seem out of place in comparison to more recent chapters. I find myself creating constant analogies to understand the world, and I want to project my vision on to my writing. As such, people complain that it's hard to understand, and expect me to dumb down the language for them. I've created entire transcriptions of chapters to explain metaphors to people. I once read something, I am not sure where it was from (a book?), about how the average person, when approached with a word they cannot understand, look AT it. They feel the need to look up the definition in the dictionary. They complain if they do not understand words. Schizophrenics, however, look THROUGH words. They can interpret a word's meaning without having to look it up. My writing is largely reliant on the five senses. You should focus not on what something means but how it makes you feel. My intention is to make people feel things, to make them feel how I feel. I think this uncertainty over the meaning of my phrases creates a feeling of confusion in the reader. Mental illnesses are a confusing thing. I suppose I'm somewhat emulating the feeling of schizophrenia for my readers. That's how I see it, anyway. Simple words, naturally, do not suit abstract thoughts. This is why I use obscure vocabulary words. I am also appealing to a large audience, in a sense, through both vocabulary and metaphors. I use vocabulary\/metaphors relating to many areas of life: architecture, law, sociology, pottery, painting, economics, chemistry, biology, physics, math, weather, psychology, meteorology, medicine, religion, history, music, astrology, astronomy, topography, oceanography, zoology, cosmetology, photography, food, etc. I take terminology from many fields in order to create a very well-rounded book. I am certain not many people are fond of the topics I write about--my main interest is moral depravity, after all. But there IS something in it for everyone, because I hope to appeal to a number of interests. People cannot conclusively say \"This isn't my type of book.\" Because there is something for them to like about it, whether they recognize this or not. I am learning about many different things while simultaneously painting the images I want to paint.\n  ","351268":"\n  Hm... but isn't it boring living that way? In the end, you realize how much time you wasted worrying about this and that, when you could have been enjoying your life. Though I understand it isn't so simple, especially if you've had this disorder for such a long time. You become so accustomed to it that you cannot release it, or imagine living without it.\n  ","351269":"\n  I understand. At the same time, it's hardly something to live for, if it brings you pain\/suffering. There are more peace-bringing reasons to live. I believe you mentioned having a lover, yes? Unless I misunderstood. But why not live for them, instead (assuming you have a lover)? What are you passionate about? And how often do you create goals (unrelated to your disorders)?\n  ","351270":"\n  Yes, though at the same time, we cannot be reduced to primal creatures, unless perhaps we are uncivilized. I know people would consider my sense of morality to be skewed. I do not consider things like cannibalism, beastiality, incest, etc., to be immoral or disturbing, and in that sense I fall within a minority. It takes a lot for me to see someone as \"evil.\" It's not a term I often use. People frequently rely on religion as a moral compass, but I do not care for it. I'm not sure what exactly will be considered immoral by many in the future (that is not already considered immoral). Technology? Who knows.\n  ","351271":"\n  I recall replying to a question like this in the past, but it was quite a while ago. I do not remember my answer, though. The thing is that morality shifts over time, but nature remains the same. In the past, people did not see slavery as a big deal, for instance. Today we see it as something barbaric and cruel. It took an entire war to make slavery illegal. You would think people could agree on its immorality, but that was not the case. I do not believe nature can be deemed immoral. What is immoral is something manmade and harmful. A phone is manmade, but it is not harmful (at least not in the slavery sense), therefore it is not immoral. Slavery, on the other hand, was something men enforced. It is not commonly found in nature. And because it is harmful, it is immoral. I will use cannibalism as another example. Cannibalism is found in nature, unlike slavery. Certain praying mantis species cannibalize their mates. Mother hamsters sometimes eat their young. So is cannibalism immoral, no. It is harmful, but because it is natural, it is not immoral. Immorality is something people assign to actions, because individuals have a conscience and are capable of complex thoughts. Other creatures can think, as well, but they are of lesser intelligence. I do not think everything harmful is immoral, unlike other people.\n  \n  My criteria is thus:\n  \n  Is this thing manmade? Yes -> Is it harmful? -> No -> It is not immoral\n  \n  Is this thing manmade? Yes -> Is it harmful? -> Yes -> It is immoral\n  \n  Is this thing manmade? No -> Morality cannot be ascribed to it\n  \n  I think it's a fair system, at least.\n  ","351272":"\n  Yeah, it sucked because I was promised to be taken to a hospital where they'd give me intensive therapy for like two weeks and finally let me share my situation with someone. That did not happen, however, because all the beds in that hospital were full. The hospital I went to has a mediocre rating, and a therapist (?) I saw there was not understanding of how I felt whatsoever. I think going there was a waste of time, really. Three weeks sounds like a long time. Do you see a therapist? I assume you see a psychiatrist, since you mentioned meds. Or maybe therapists prescribe meds where you live, I'm not sure. Luckily I've only been to the hospital one time. It was over two years ago, but it feels like only a few months ago. I genuinely cannot remember much of 2019.\n  ","351273":"\n  It was in late 2016, probably around October or so. I was sensitive to light and sound for quite some time afterward. I remember bringing earplugs to school because the lunchroom was so loud. You never realize how bright the lights at school are until you get a concussion. I did not take any time off. I tried going without the internet for a while, to recover, but it made me feel too depressed. Shortly after I got the concussion (and still had it), I was at my locker when a boy slammed his locker door against my head. It was an accident, but it naturally made my head feel even worse. I thought I might've had a brain bleed at that point, so I went to the hospital (I'm pretty sure this was days later, because my parents did not care), but it was alright. For a concussion to go away, you have to avoid sources of stimulation, but I could not avoid them. I had never experienced a headache before I got this concussion. I've had headaches ever since I got it. These headaches used to be rather constant. I'm no longer sensitive to light\/sound, but my head starts hurting if I listen to certain music. After I got the concussion, I started seeing these floating black dots, kind of like what you see if you rub your eyes for too long (or look at the sun for too long?). I did not think too much of the dots. But eventually I started seeing hallucinations. This makes me wonder if maybe my hallucinations were caused by the concussion. Or maybe it's just a coincidence. Yes, thank you for making it less confusing now. \ud83c\udf37\n  ","351274":"\n  I suppose a mixture of both. But if I am to get any recognition, I'd rather it be the good kind of recognition. I do not imagine my writing will amass a large audience. It appeals to a very niche group of people, and I have no interest in changing the subjects I write about in order to attract more fans. I write as self-expression. All of my characters are based off of me, in one way or another. Some of their emotions are also very much my own. This is my one outlet for unpleasant feelings, I'd say. Or pleasant ones, for that matter. Other ambitions, well... I want to be a multi-skilled person. I have many interests, and I might as well make use of them. My plan is to have several jobs: psychologist (main), author, photographer, translator, and taxidermist. Plus even more. I plan to get a ton of money so I can travel and enjoy life to the fullest.\n  ","351275":"\n  I liked the movie adaptation of it. I believe this author deserves more recognition, and it is strange that his works are so obscure despite all the scandals surrounding him. He was an interesting man, and I want to do his books justice by translating them. I plan to finish translating this book and then move on to a more personal book of his. Yes, I think people should find more words, because the average ones are not specific enough. The word for love and cupid are the same in French, so I accidentally kept translating something as love rather than cupid.\n  ","351276":"\n  Yeah, some people are like that, they just want to be polite. I wish they'd show a genuine interest. It's annoying to share writing with friends, too, because they're often like \"Send the next chapters,\" without expressing what they like about the story. Of course, I'd rather people say nothing than say something critical. But it's always the same (non-constructive) criticism, so I'm kind of used to it.\n  ","351277":"\n  It's nothing, really. I'm used to talking about this sort of thing. Yes, but at least I got on medicine relatively early compared to other people. It seems like depression and eating disorders run in my family, but oddly no one has hallucinations like me, or OCD, or manic episodes. I know they say mental illnesses are hereditary, but in my case they hardly are\n  ","351278":"\n  I prefer to write spontaneously. I think it creates more suspense\/unpredictable scenes. Because if I can predict what will happen next (through planning), the reader probably can, too! That's my weird logic, anyway. It probably depends on what type of stuff you write about, too. You should probably study how people interact IRL and learn to read facial expressions and body language to get these things across in your writing. My main issue with people's stories is that the dialogue is so incredibly unrealistic. Think, \"Would anyone actually say this?\" Consider how realistic the characters themselves are, too. They are bound to be more realistic if they're based off of you\/people you personally know.\n  ","351279":"\n  Hm... well, I see no reason to learn how to drive before I'm in college. I'll forget how to. I'm scared of driving because of hallucinations, too. I was once in the car (not driving, obviously) and I hallucinated a man standing in the middle of the road. Imagine if I were driving and stopped the car, then everyone crashed into me. So I'm scared. About getting a job, most of them require you to stand\/walk around. My back hurts if I stand or walk for too long, though. I'd be happy with some office job, but they do not really offer those to someone who is young, from what I understand. They would rather I work in retail or food service, but my back wouldn't allow that. So I'm kind of stuck.\n  ","351280":"\n  Wow, that's a long time. I haven't had issues with it for nearly as long as you. I'd say my body image issues started around 7, but I didn't get an eating disorder until 13. I've mostly curbed it by now. I have come to realize that eating disorders are driven by OCD (obsessive thoughts about food, calories, and your body, and compulsions regarding weighing yourself, only eating a certain amount, exercising, etc.), and thus if you focus on your OCD itself, it's easier to help the eating disorder. I noticed that my eating disorder came around the time when my OCD sprang up, so there must be a correlation, keeping these symptoms in mind. I wonder if OCD meds help?\n  ","351281":"\n  Getting accepted into a university, improving at roller skating, making my own game, translating more novels, pressing leaves, taxidermizing animals, having a plant nursery, making more YouTube videos, possibly making a documentary, exploring the world, photographing abandoned places, learning origami, learning to knit, sewing stuffed animals, learning pottery, learning about different types of birds (I plan to birdwatch), learning to code, learning to paint, learning to make jewelry... I want to publish a poetry book someday, too.\n  ","351282":"\n  I'm sorry, I probably made it sound complicated. ;;; I can try to simplify it, though:\n  \n  MBTI types work through cognitive functions. These functions are how we perceive\/interact with the world.\n  \n  You can have four of the following functions:\n  \n  Ne - Scattered focus, considers endless possibilities, divergent\n  \n  Ni - Singular focus, usually considers the most plausible possibility, convergent\n  \n  Te - Concrete, goal oriented, big picture\n  \n  Ti - Hypothetical, enjoys the process, focuses on details\n  \n  Se - Focused on the present, enjoys aesthetics, cares about the five senses, more progressive\n  \n  Si - Focused on the past, enjoys sentimentality, more traditional\n  \n  Fe - Values social norms, views tend to be acceptable\/agreeable, considers the feelings of others before themselves (when making decisions)\n  \n  Fi - Values personal beliefs, views may be controversial, considers their own feelings before the feelings of others (when making decisions)\n  \n  The functions either work in this order: extroverted, introverted, extroverted, introverted\n  \n  Or: introverted, extroverted, introverted, extroverted\n  \n  If your dominant function is an extroverted one, it means your cognitive focus is on the environment\/external relations. It does not mean you are socially an extrovert. Similarly, if your dominant function is an introverted one, it means your cognitive focus is on the internal (you are more introspective\/brooding). It does not mean you are socially an introvert.\n  \n  For an example, Se stands for extroverted sensing, and Si stands for introverted sensing.\n  \n  My functions are Fi-Se-Ni-Te. Notice how there are not two introverted or extroverted functions beside one another (it's impossible).\n  \n  Because my dominant function is Fi, I care about personal values over everything else. Te is my weakest function.\n  \n  INFJ functions are Ni-Fe-Ti-Se.\n  \n  I would say Ti and Se are functions that are more \"enjoy the moment.\" Si focuses on the past, and Ni, Ne (?), and Te focus on the future.\n  \n  Thus if your dominant function is Ni, you have a very particular focus in life, you are future-oriented, and you are metaphorical. Someone who has Ni in general is metaphorical, but not as much as someone with dominant Ni, unless they are mentally ill (because some mental illnesses cause you to think more metaphorically).\n  \n  I hope this isn't too complicated! I'm not too well-versed in MBTI, so I have a hard time explaining it. ;;; I just think it's nice to get into. But if you'd rather not, that's okay, MBTI isn't for everyone. It's more convoluted than enneagram. The functions are overwhelming.\n  ","351283":"\n  EST. If you mean my government teacher, she seems very laid-back. She has a tendency to expose herself to opinions she already agrees with, rather than venturing out, but she tries her best. Whatever her political affiliation is, she is the type to feel strongly about what she believes in. Perhaps she is only laid-back in videos, however. She seems kind of... vengeful, maybe? There is something beneath the surface.\n  ","351284":"\n  When I say something along those lines, I mean that I can predict when someone will disappoint me. I often give them the opportunity to prove me wrong, but they disappoint me, as I thought they would. Not everyone is disappointing (in life), but many people, yes. I think it should be changed to \"Most people disappoint me,\" or even \"Some people disappoint me,\" to sound like less of a cognitive distortion. But we are considering everyone out of a given group--those who seem as if they will disappoint in the future, not those who seem promising. In reference to other people, though, well... it is a cognitive distortion, in the end. Unless you have a great instinct, it's an unreliable statement. I hate it when someone says they \"cannot trust anybody.\" That is a major distortion, no matter who you are. It would be more realistic to say \"I've had a hard time reading people correctly.\"\n  ","351285":"\n  I see, I don't think I've heard that reason before, so thank you. \ud83c\udf3a I would say I have changed in some areas, but perhaps not others. I went from experiencing little to no empathy to experiencing an excess of empathy. Neither of these extremes are good. I remember how, at the height of the BLM movement, I wanted to write poems for every individual impacted by police brutality. But it's impossible for one person to write so many poems, you know? I wrote rant after rant on the injustice of police brutality, and cried again and again. And it was like... damn, what is happening to me? I try to stabilize my empathy, but I'm someone who's prone to extremes in life, so it's hard. \"Oh, this empathy is overwhelming me. It'd be better to go back to having none.\" That kind of thing. Hm, I attribute this transformation of empathy to my lover. The issue with society, I have realized, is this--someone acts out, or intends to act out, and rather than empathizing with that person and trying to help them out of that state, people condemn them, harass them, and so forth. People are quick to title someone a \"sociopath\" and such, too. But I believe the majority of \"sociopaths\" are people who did not receive adequate empathy\/care throughout life, and thus do not know how to empathize with or care for others. Was I ever a sociopath, no, I was an unhealthy schizophrenic with low empathy. But I can apply my former situation to that of others. I use this analogy quite often--if you have never eaten a strawberry before, how can you be expected to explain the flavor of it to someone else? This is how empathy works, in my opinion. I found myself empathizing with my lover (this is before we got together), because she empathized with me first. I lacked this empathy from other people. For a while she was the only person I could empathize with, but she helped me to share my empathy with other people. I would say I lost my empathy in late 2016\/early 2017, and gained it back, somewhat, in late 2017. It did not develop properly until around mid-2018. But I still clung to this image of being a very sadistic person and such, perhaps as a defense mechanism. I thought no one would bother me if they were intimidated by me. But people fear what they do not understand, and fear leads to hostility. I would not have been so attacked if it weren't for how I portrayed myself. My portrayal was never deceptive, I think I just neglected to \"update\" my image, so to speak. I went from watching a video of kittens being murdered (and enjoying it) to crying over injured kittens. Leaving behind traumatic memories, and traumatic places, helped me to grow and become more peaceful. It was a combination of wanting to create a new life for myself and having my lover assist me along the way. I know some people have crude things to say about her, because they do not know her well enough, but I genuinely mean it when I say I wouldn't be here today without her.\n  ","351286":"\n  Hm, but isn't it kind of counterproductive? \"Without my eating disorder, I would die.\" But eating disorders kill people. It is something to emotionally cling to, understandably. I have a hard time letting go of my tendencies, as well. I am probably too dependent in love. ;;; The thought of a breakup scares me, because I know it would absolutely shatter me. I'm lucky it's never happened to me. In the past my main driving force was my career goal. I do still value it, but it isn't all I have.\n  ","351287":"\n  I do not separate people between good and evil in the sense others often think. And I'm an atheist, so there's no such thing as sin in my book. For me it is more about who has good and bad intentions. If you are a good person, it means you have good intentions. You can do bad things without necessarily being a bad person. Thank you for reading my answers.\n  ","351288":"\n  Thank you, I appreciate it. And you taking the time to get to know me. Not many people do that. It was only one time, for a few days (in October of 2018). I was missing school from being in the hospital, so I had to be taken home. It was an unpleasant experience (being at the hospital). You were not allowed to cry there for more than like five minutes. I saw a girl beat another girl's head against the floor. The shower was very dark, and there was little privacy. My roommate kept staring at me all the time. I made a few friends there, but I had no way to keep in touch with them. The food was great, so I can't complain about that. I did not feel safe, though.\n  ","351289":"\n  Thank you! I was very dedicated to entertaining myself. I was not writing with the intent of publication back then. My current works, however, I wish to publish, so I actually put more effort into them. I consider myself to be very ambitious, and once I have a goal, I do not back down from it. That included writing something with over 1,000 chapters. Now I just want to finish the book I'm writing, haha. I'm not really sure. Back then I wanted to publish a book at a young age--12, for instance. I found it impressive that children could write and publish books. But the circumstances did not allow for it. I have come to understand that books written when you are very young tend to not be very good. It's important to have significant experience before publishing. By now I have an abundance of experience. I've been writing for years and years, and my style has changed for the better (in my opinion). I wanted to have something to show for, I guess? I haven't achieved many things in life, at least from my perspective. I've never won a contest or anything like that, I mean. I do not have a university degree to represent academic achievement. I do have, however, a high GPA, and my essays have been lauded throughout the years. My writing has been compared to that of Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe, by teachers, classmates, friends, parents, and so on. I think it is very different, but I can see the parallels. Poe's works were very morose, like mine. Shakespeare wrote in a rhythmical way, as I do (and his style is not easily understood). It's funny to look back on my old writing, because it's just so bad. That's to be expected, though, when you're like 9. I had this belief that I was a very strange and misunderstood person, despite the fact that there was, at the time, nothing to indicate such. I wrote about demons who were ostracized from society. It was kind of prophetic, because now I actually have reason to feel that way. The writing is kind of cute in how overly dramatic yet simplistic it was.\n  ","351290":"\n  I agree. I'm not fluent in French, so I rely on French dictionaries and such to find the meaning of words. I use Google translate when I am unsure of the formatting, but it isn't reliable when it comes to specific words, because a single word can have multiple meanings. I once tried to translate a phrase through Google and it said \"He shot his cannon,\" but the true meaning was \"He blew his nose.\" There are expressions you have to pick up on. I used to translate on sticky notes and then type up the translations, but the book is too thick from the sticky notes and will probably fall apart if I add more, so I moved to just translating on the document. The document itself is over 100 pages long now.\n  ","351291":"\n  It depends on the day. Sometimes I like my appearance, and other times I do not. I would say I have a nice nose. I like my eyebags, too. I know that's a strange thing to like about yourself, and most people want to hide their eyebags, but I embrace them. It's mostly my legs and hips that I dislike. I also have acne. If I go in front of a mirror, it's often to ensure that I do not have any rheum. I try not to look at myself too often, because I'd rather not. I even covered the mirror in my room with drawings because I do not want to see myself. I either feel self-loathing or I am happy with myself. Sometimes I feel that people would rather I not be in this world, but other times I feel that I make important contributions. I think I have the capacity to feel a deep appreciation for things, and I often do feel a deep appreciation. I'm a very passionate person, and I'm worthwhile. Hm, I'm hard to be friends with in the sense that I have a hard time maintaining consistent contact with people. It's easy for me to open up to someone, so they can certainly be my friend, but I have this compulsion to not reply to people. It's nothing personal. So I rarely talk to my friends. I'm loyal to them, though. That's the good part about being my friend--I'll never betray you. And I do not enjoy conflict, so I will not start fights, either. You just won't hear from me much, unless you're in a Discord server with me. But I'm hesitant to join any servers, so. Don't apologize for your questions! I like them, and thank you for showing an interest in me.\n  ","351292":"\n  I rarely ever go outside. The last time was actually not TOO long ago, though. It was on the 30th of November. But it probably doesn't count much, because we just went to a restaurant, lol. I didn't spend time outdoors. I went outside days before that to go skating, which I hadn't done in probably two months. I would say I go outside maybe once a month, just to be driven somewhere (my mom might drag me shopping). Sometimes once every like three months. Over the summer (but not this latest summer because of corona) I go to the amusement park basically every week. We go on vacation to South Carolina and go to the beach there. Other than going outside during the summer, I only really went outside to go to the bus stop to get to school, wait for my bus to take me home, etc. I stay home more now that I'm not in school. I go out to eat every now and then. Hm, maybe. I am afraid of leaving my house in the sense of not actually going somewhere. I can't go for a walk, as an example. I get paranoid about cars passing by. I can go if I'm not alone, but I still find it unpleasant. Public places usually make me hallucinate, too.\n  ","351293":"\n  I'm still not very good at it, haha. I was doing it wrong this whole time, in fact! I rarely skate because my mom has to help me, but she is usually in some kind of pain or too busy. I follow about 115 people, and I have 1,168 followers. I follow these people for any or all of the following reasons: they asked me to follow them in exchange for following me (I do not always comply; it depends on their content), they ask good questions, or they give good answers.\n  ","351294":"\n  I think it was a gift for my lover. I had a ruined roll of film (it did not develop properly), but rather than throwing it away, I sewed drawings to it. I do not write very often. I try to, but I get distracted. I end up writing like two sentences per week. Then I have random days where I suddenly am not distracted at all, and I write several paragraphs, or even several pages. It takes longer to write than it used to, because I have to find the perfect words for what I want to express. There are only so many dictionaries online, and most of them do not have the words I want.\n  ","351295":"\n  I've accidentally made like three accounts on this site, but I remember officially using it in I think late 2017. Well, I enjoy answering questions, and sometimes asking them. Some people on here are mean, like anywhere else, but there are some great users, too. I wish they had an IP banning system, and that they'd tell you what you got a ban warning for. They should have phishing scam as a report option, as well as the option to report inappropriate profile images. They should censor certain words to combat harassment, but be more lenient on certain rules. For example, I once got a ban warning for I think using a picture of an anime-style character smoking, lol. They never said what I got the warning for, but they have some strict rules on this site regarding the wrong things.\n  ","351296":"\n  Sure. My hallucinations primarily revolve around bugs, because I have a major fear of them (though I should mention it's improving with time!). I hallucinate moths and other insects. When I wasn't on medicine, I hallucinated maggots everywhere. I'd pour a bowl of cereal and see maggots writhing inside of it. I even saw maggots in a random tiny body of water. I've never actually seen a maggot in person before, which is ironic. But we had a moth infestation in the past. The moths originated from some expired food. I believe the moths grew from little worms, or maybe the worms were separate. But you'd see these worms crawling on the ceiling, and if you were unlucky, you'd see them in a box of cereal, too. This is where the fear of maggots must have started, though those worms were not maggots (because if I'm not mistaken, maggots are fly larvae, not moth larvae). I hallucinated walls shifting and closing in on me. For a while I saw random objects falling--a yellow (?) pillow fell from the ceiling of my room, and as I was showering I felt a bar of soap fall beneath me, too. Of course, there was not actually a pillow there, nor a bar of soap. The thing about these hallucinations is that they COULD be plausible. It's not strange to see a pillow in your own bedroom, or for soap to fall in the shower. But they just weren't real phenomena. While waiting at the bus stop one time, I hallucinated an entire bus rounding a corner. I pointed to it and told my brother it was there, and he said there was no bus. These hallucinations look very real, and it's hard to determine whether they are real or not. I have a sort of mistrust toward my perceptions now. I hallucinate a certain smell and taste at times. I can't really describe it. Imagine smelling dust, and tasting it. That's kind of the similarity. I once hallucinated a fork hanging from a classroom ceiling. (I have a foggy memory of this next thing, but I'll recount it as I remember it) - A few months back, when I was still physically in school (and keep in mind I was on meds), I went to the bathroom. I saw that a stall door was closed, and someone was in it, based on their feet from under the door. I went in the stall beside that one, as such. When I came out, I saw that the other stall door was in fact open, and there was no one in there. It wasn't that someone had been in the stall and they left the bathroom. No one had ever been in there. I was alone the whole time. And it was no surprise, given that I was staying after school that day, and most people had left already. I also hallucinated some people sitting on a bench while I was on the bus. Every now and then I hallucinate a corpse either inside or outside of my house. As for auditory hallucinations, they are mostly male voices screaming at me and telling me to die. Sometimes they weep. I usually hear multiple voices at once.\n  ","351297":"\n  A combination of both. I have some child-like interests, and I enjoy things from my childhood in general. My brain is comparable to that of someone who is older than my actual age, since my early puberty increased my stage of development. Despite writing about mature subjects and having some notably mature interests (on top of the more childish ones), I sometimes struggle to feel older, because I do not have much independence yet. I'm not quite in university yet, for instance. No driver's license (or permit), no job, can't cook.... Online people mistake me for someone older, but I would say I look younger than I am, or maybe I look my age.\n  ","351298":"\n  Yep, I'm that type of person. I'm very accustomed to solitude. From the age of around 7 and onward, I started to isolate myself. Our house, at that time, had a third floor, with only a single room (this room featured the computer). I stayed in there all the time, away from everyone else. I rarely experience loneliness, and I have fun on my own. I do not require friends to feel happy. I would say I'm less content with never seeing someone again than I used to be, because I couldn't imagine never talking to my lover. I need her in my life. As for everyone else, I do not really need their company (though I do appreciate the company of some people, of course). I'm not someone who craves physical contact or anything, either.\n  ","351299":"\n  Hm... when I say pure, I am not talking about morals, more so decisions, interests, and the like. I do not believe in the concept of sin, which I know dictates, for most people, what makes something pure or impure. For me it's more someone or something minding its business and doing as it pleases without really bothering anyone. Take a heron, for instance. I think they are very underrated, and I consider them to be pure. They go unnoticed, and you do not particularly think of them as harmful. I think they have a special sort of beauty, given their unimposing nature. I would say certain animals are pure, and young children. Some adults, as well. It's harder for adults to be pure because they have knowledge of harsh things which they may resort to, and they are more imposing. People also become less idealistic\/hopeful over time. I would say idealism and a sense of hopefulness signify purity. For instance, if terrible things have happened to you, but you are hopeful (you must also be harmless). Being harmless, being idealistic, being hopeful, being carefree, having childish interests... I'd say those things are pure. Someone would probably make the argument that nothing is impure, then, because everyone is harmful (in the sense that they kill for food and such). But I more so mean having malicious intent. If you blackmail people, doxx them, etc., you are not pure. Those things represent ill intent. Anyway, I do not think purity is a single thing, it encompasses several different traits. An idea or non-living thing can be pure, as well. A rainbow, for instance. Because it brings happiness while not hurting anyone.\n  ","351300":"\n  My day has been alright. I've done some physics assignments, and I watched a government lecture video. I need to read part of a play for English and answer questions on that, as well. Other than assignments, I've been answering questions on here, haha. I'm kind of worried about my wrists, though, because they start to hurt if I type too much. I look forward to writing soon, when I have the time. I'm worried about my teacher not responding back to me.\n  ","351301":"\n  I think most films are boring and a waste of time. My attention span is rather short, so I do not find myself watching movies very often. That should be evident with how I get distracted while writing. The last thing I watched was Midsommar. Before that it was Juno. I'm not quite sure of what I would like to watch next. I will watch whatever my lover wants to watch together. I decided to watch Juno after hearing about Elliot Page's trans identity, so spontaneous things like that will make me watch something, too.\n  ","351302":"\n  Yeah, I can't stand people who go on about how they're so morally correct and good, but then they go around harassing people and being bitchy. If you are a good person then you wouldn't feel the need to mention it every two seconds. I consider myself to be a good judge of character, yes. I sometimes befriend people whom I know will disappoint me\/betray me in the end. Why? I have no clue. I think I want to assume the best in people, and for them to pleasantly surprise me, but unfortunately things always turn out as I think they will. I should trust my intuition more, certainly. I can read someone with minimal information, just a little description of who they are. It's happened before that someone has given me a sentence about someone and I've done a complete analysis of them.\n  ","351303":"\n  I was a very unstable and delusional person, because the schizophrenic aspect of my disorder was very prominent. I was not on medicine back then. I believed zombies were real, that maggots were colonizing my body, that there was a man living in a wall in my closet, etc. I had very irrational beliefs, but I did not impose them on anyone. I care about not being perceived as someone who is illogical. I came off as very logical and composed, and helped people with their psychological issues while sort of stifling my own. One of the symptoms of schizophrenia\/schizoaffective disorder is having a lack of empathy. I could not empathize with humans, nor living creatures in general. I watched the most extreme porn I could find--violent, depraved. Nothing was hardcore enough for me. I began to want to commit a crime, and confessed to this. The most infamous crime, I decided. One that everyone would remember. I gained this reputation of being twisted, scary, even a potential threat. Others suspected I was trolling or just trying to be \"edgy,\" but that was never the case, I was just genuinely very mentally ill and homicidal. I was adamant on committing a crime to prove those who doubted my ability to do so wrong. But you know, I think I've grown a lot since then. Now I have TOO MUCH empathy, and cry over the slightest things. I'm still a sadist, but not as much of a sadist as I once was. I no longer want to commit a crime. Back then I just had no reason to live. It was either commit a crime and go to jail or commit suicide. I saw those as my only choices. I have a reason to live now, though. I think I have a lot more to offer than having strange fetishes. I am haunted by this version of myself because it's the version people still make me out to be. \"Oh, this is Yaoi, she's a very mentally ill fetishist who plans to commit a crime.\" And I admit I still somewhat cling to this part of myself, too, because I've convinced myself it's what makes me interesting. Or they will completely lie about me, and suggest I've already committed crimes. People refuse to get to know the present me, and to acknowledge my development. I've moved on in life, but it seems like they never will.\n  ","351304":"\n  Hm, they're pretty manageable. It used to be difficult because I'd go to school for hours and then go home and study for hours. There was no time for hobbies. Now, however, I only have three classes, and while they consume a decent portion of my day, I do not spend hours studying anymore. Too lazy, I guess. As long as I get good grades, I do not mind. I sleep roughly 8-10 hours a day. I hardly have a support system. My parents support me, to a degree, but I am not on good terms with other family members (they believe false rumors about me, like most people seem to... or I've given them the real story but they choose to misunderstand me). My younger brother is nice to me. My mother is the type who rants to strangers. She's very dramatic and emotional. She obsesses over certain people for a long time (she knows everything there is to know about Michael Jackson and Prince, lol). My father is the stoic type. He reads many books, and he rarely ever cries in front of anyone. But he's impatient and has a short temper. He's an alcoholic and a smoker. He does not seem to care about his health, or the health of others. He lies a lot and denies both smoking and drinking. He's a fairly dangerous person. Yes, I have eight siblings, but I only live with my younger brother and our parents.\n  ","351305":"\n  Hm, I think when it comes to things I enjoy. I do not mean that in the sense that I have few hobbies\/things I enjoy, though. I consider most writing to be horrendous, for example. I like to read, but people write such painfully repetitive and boring things. I'm picky with how people phrase things. I'm picky with friends, finding most people boring, just like most literature, movies, etc. I'm not a picky eater. I'm picky about what I like and dislike, in various realms of life. But I can also see beauty in practically everything. I'm proud of my writing skills, my intuition, my honesty, my dedication, the fact that I'm a good friend, my morality, my self growth, my knowledge, my open mind. I'm ashamed of my past, and how passive I can be. I would say I'm ashamed of how I used to self harm, but I never left any marks on myself, so there is no visible shame (I sought the most painless form of harm, which no one can see). I'm ashamed of some things I said in the past. I'm ashamed of giving some people the benefit of the doubt and assuming the best in them. Yeah, I'm not very nice to myself. I call myself an idiot and such without noticing. I have negative thoughts about my body, and experience a lot of guilt for things, even things that are not my fault. I'm quick to blame myself, and to hate myself. I quickly spiral over anything that is remotely upsetting. Well, I used to harbor hatred for the world. I hated how people treated me. But it's too overwhelming to hate the world, so the anger turned inward, and I hated myself instead. I'm not as self-loathing as I used to be, though.\n  ","351306":"\n  My OCD is mostly compulsions rather than obsessive thoughts, but lately I've been having more of those thoughts. It became full-blown during 2016, when I developed the compulsion to watch 27+ anime episodes per day. I became very anxious if I watched less than 27. I refused to go to a friend's house during that time, because it would interrupt my schedule. I turned down other things, such as going to the pool, too. This compulsion took over my life. I completed anime after anime, but not joyously. I would say it was a way of taking control in life. At the time I did not have my own computer, so I was on the downstairs computer all the time. As I've said before, my parents are always fighting, so I was exposed to their fights downstairs each day. There have also been many bug infestations in my house--mostly moths, fruit flies, and carpet beetles. One time we had fleas, because one of my sisters worked at the zoo and likely brought them home. I needed to compensate for my environment, to somehow keep myself stable. It took until late 2017 or early 2018, I believe, for this compulsion to go away. While my compulsions once contributed to cleanliness, I now have compulsions related to messes. The compulsion to not put up my clothes, for instance. I developed obsessive thoughts about diseases. If I merely see blood, and don't even touch it or anything, I panic, thinking I have contracted HIV. I know it sounds irrational to people, but that's how OCD works. Or if someone accidentally spits on me (because you know, people sometimes spit when they talk), I start thinking I have hepatitis. I have obsessive thoughts about walking on the street. I think someone will stab me with a diseased needle. I have some small but annoying compulsions. When I was physically in school, I repeatedly checked my backpack throughout the day, in fear of my phone falling out. A bracelet I wear often fell off, so I had to keep checking for that, too.\n  ","351307":"\n  No problem! I like sharing. Yeah, it's kind of a contradiction because I'd consider myself to be a fairly spontaneous and unplanned person, yet I also abide by a rather strict schedule. It's not as bad as it used to be, though. Translating time is at 5:30 PM, for instance, but sometimes I'm forced to translate later on. At least my OCD prevents me from procrastinating.\n  ","351308":"\n  I'm not anti-meds, I'm anti-substances. If that makes sense. I do not support the use of cocaine, vapes, alcohol, etc. I've never done any substances, personally. Not interested in weed and other \"harmless\" drugs, either. I'm also anti-med abuse, of course. I do not support the misuse of painkillers and addictive meds. I have no problem with the reasonable use of meds. I mean, they're necessary for my conditions. I do not take meds for my OCD, because the primary meds for it are SSRIs. I consider SSRIs to be terrible, because their side effects are usually not worth any help they provide. Some conditions I believe you can treat without meds--depression, for instance. I take meds for both hallucinations\/delusions and extreme moods, because they cannot really be treated without them. I tried to treat them on my own, of course. But there is no \"self cure\" for hallucinations, you know. I'm not sure how well the mood meds help, but I haven't been to a mental hospital since 2018, so I'd like to think they work. I went from having constant auditory and visual hallucinations, as well as unremitting derealization (and the occasional depersonalization) to having auditory hallucinations only when distressed (or in public places, if I do not listen to music... music seems to help a lot), and a visual hallucination maybe once every two weeks or so. I no longer feel derealized or depersonalized. I still get catatonic episodes, though, and sometimes psychotic episodes (but again, only when distressed).\n  \n  Also, I'm not sure why people always seem to suggest I \"need professional help.\" I've been seeing a psychiatrist since 2017, and a therapist since 2018. I saw a different therapist in 2017, but he did not take me seriously enough, despite the fact that I had major issues. He was ageist or something. Anyway, I already have professional help. People assume stupid things, even though I talk about taking meds again and again.\n  ","351309":"\n  Well, I wrote it when I was around 8-10. Each chapter was not very long, essentially a big paragraph of text. I did not care about traditional formatting, so I never used quotation marks (until the very end). It ended up being a mess, as such. I did not even separate dialogue into its own lines. I was writing it solely for my enjoyment. No one else was reading it. And I'm rather glad they did not, because it was an embarrassment. I never actually \"finished\" it. It was an ongoing story with various parts. The first story in the series, the prequel, was roughly 100 chapters long. The next story was around 1,000 chapters long, but I do not remember finishing it? Or maybe I started a third story in the series. Anyway. At first I suggested 900, but when I went back and checked, it was over 900. I lost a good 90% of that story. The writing website I used was taken down without any prior warning. I salvaged a more recent story. I requested a file copy of what they had archived from my account. It's a massive file, but there are only bits and pieces of random chapters here and there. So I might have chapters 850, 236, 178, 47, etc. Nothing complete. It's evidence that it HAPPENED, but it's all I have left. I also have various notebooks I wrote parts of chapters in. I had over 2,000 chapters of content on that account, from starting various other stories along the way. I had a little rhyming book, and a book of rants. I took a break from the 1,000+ chapter long story, which ended up being permanent. I'm kind of glad I never continued it, because even more chapters would have been lost. It took me about a month to start writing again, after this major loss. I could have stopped entirely, but I didn't.\n  ","351310":"\n  Mostly little animals, such as squirrels and birds. It would be nice to preserve their beauty. I actually wrote a little thing on being enamored, for a college application. It goes as follows:\n  \n  \"I find that people often have the same favorite word--something simple like 'love' or 'hope.' Mine is 'enamored.' I consider myself to be quite romantic; I\u2019ve written roughly 27 love poems. At one point I even collected roses.\n  \n  Roses dwindle in beauty and die, unlike love, which I perceive to be a permanent emotion. I do not believe in second or third relationships, nor do I believe you can fall 'out of love' with someone. Perhaps I would be considered an idealist, in this respect. Individuals often harbor such superficial emotions. If love is able to die, it means it was never true love to begin with.\n  \n  I am forever enamored, both by my significant other and the world itself. I am able to see beauty in everything, and my love is peaceful and sincere. I admire from afar and love in close proximity. I prioritize my lover above all else. Knowing my love is reciprocated, and that I alone am not enamored, brings me serenity and prosperity.\"\n  \n  I enjoy the taste of certain foods, but not when I am upset. Then it becomes a struggle even to chew, and I spit the food up. That probably sounds gross, lol, but it's true. I simultaneously have a bad relationship with food, because of my eating disorder tendencies. My physical health is not very good. My body tends to hurt. I've had back pain for years. I figure it's because of the vitamin D deficiency. That's the root of my physical problems, I've determined. I started puberty early, and ironically have \"growing pains\" to this day. It's like my body wants to continue growing but it cannot.\n  ","351311":"\n  (Trigger warning for anyone reading)\n  \n  When I was 13, I began starving myself. I counted calories all the time and weighed myself again and again. I exercised frantically. When my mom found out about my problem, she threatened to take me to the hospital and force me to have a feeding tube... she did not bother to try to understand me. My parents have this attitude in general, of not wanting to deal with anything and not wanting to give support. Anyway, I ended up weighing less than I did in 4th grade. But because I knew no one would actually help me get better, I helped myself. Gained the weight back, but still skipped meals sometimes. I have this tendency to want to do it all over again. I hate eating in front of people. I almost always feel fat, even though I'm objectively not. I can't even get a snack without feeling guilty and hating how I look.\n  ","351312":"\n  I fell off my scooter (this was when I was like 9), and I broke my ankle and part of my leg. My growth plate closed. I needed surgery for the other one to be closed, too, and to insert some screws (?) to protect the injured ankle. This meant that my feet could not grow bigger but I could still grow taller. If the other one was not closed, I would have grown on only one leg. My feet were already a size 8 (adult), so it was fine. Even years after the surgery, my ankles are fragile. I cannot run or jump much. I still have scars from it, too.\n  ","351313":"\n  I compare it to their fears and statements about things. I know people who do not fear needles and sharp objects, for example. Girls tend to have some or all of the following fetishes: being slapped, having their hair pulled, knifeplay\/gunplay, and being choked. I have no such interests. I am a sadist, not masochistic in the slightest. I would say the prevalence of these fetishes shows that other people tend to have a higher pain tolerance than me. Even just getting pinched is too much. But I would gladly hurt someone to their heart's content.\n  ","351314":"\n  I have a friend who is pretty much exactly like me, but I would say she does not use her intuition in the same way and has trouble reading people's intentions toward her. We get along very well. I've never had a conflict with her (not that I've had them with other friends, really). I tend to disagree with people on things, but she and I share the same views.\n  ","351315":"\n  No problem. Yeah, that's alright. The last thing that made me cry was probably one of my teachers using capslock. I know it sounds dumb. But she sounded very passive aggressive and angry at me. I got a 100% on an essay in English (which I consider impressive for an AP lit class, given the essays I've read from other people, and the grades they got), so I guess those things cancel each other out. It's still sad, though. And sorry, I can't talk about my age because of unpleasant memories associated with it. I'm old enough to vote, so there's that.\n  ","351316":"\n  Hm... but would you describe yourself as a very metaphorical person? INFJs have a dominant Ni function. Ni is future oriented, focuses on a single task (not scattered), relies on metaphors for communication. It is a convergent function. They have an inferior Se function, meaning they struggle with living in the present. INFJs also have Fe rather than Fi. This means pleasantries and small talk do not bother them. They are inclusive when it comes to groups, and do not particularly want to stand out. They value social norms. INFJs have Ti, which is a subjective judgment function. This means that they consider \"self truths\" rather than the objective truth. A type with a Ti preference is often more biased than someone with Te (Si is also a relatively biased function, but if we consider the eight function model, it's the INFJ's weakest function... Ni is more objective, and because it is so prominent for INFJs, they tend to be pretty realistic). When it comes to goals, they care more about the process than actually reaching the end result. Because they have a strong Fi function (since Fi is their sixth function, which is even more prominent than the fifth, oddly), they can seem to be less of a Fe user. They are more well-rounded than some other types. While they have a preference for abiding by social norms, they can at times go against this. Just because someone has a preference for Fe does not mean they are superficial, they are just more tolerant of casual things. They would rather say \"I'm fine\" when asked how they are, because that is a convenient response which makes people comfortable. Someone with a Fi preference, on the other hand, would be more open about how they truly feel. They are more likely to go on tangents.\n  \n  Anyway, just thought I'd share some info on INFJs, haha. Not doubting your typing.\n  ","351317":"\n  Take care not to believe the majority of people who claim to be an INFJ. I'm an ISFP, personally. But I just wanted to state that most people are uneducated on the subject of MBTI. They go with whatever result they get on 16Personalities, which is an unreliable, sorry excuse for a site. Someone who types themselves as an INFJ is usually an INFP, or at the very least enneagram 4. After all, they read that INFJs are the \"rarest type,\" and both INFPs and type fours have a tendency to want to be seen as unique. These people do not have the dominant Ni function. Their Fi is all over the place.\n  ","351318":"\n  It depends on the day, really. I do homework practically daily. I try to write, but get distracted by various sites. I sometimes play games, and even record videos. I stay in my room for most of the day. On a terrible day, I have a psychotic and catatonic episode. On a better day, I probably cry over something minor, because I'm too sensitive and have a mood disorder. On one of the best days, I am at peace with the universe. I kind of have a porn addiction, so there's that, too. And I live with trauma, and the perpetual feeling of never belonging in society. I'm rarely bored. My parents fight all the time, so it's best not to go downstairs much. I do not have a job, so that responsibility isn't there. Hm. Yeah, if you want to be in my shoes, just have fun trying to regulate my moods\/be stable. It's hard, even with meds. But friends say they would never want to be in my place, because they'd rather not deal with hallucinations and such. My living environment isn't exactly the best, either.\n  ","351319":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SYXmnJI_gOQ&ab_channel=zettairyouiki\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351320":"\n  I always wanted to be different characters, to the point where I even put the name of characters on sticky notes each day and wore them. I told people to call me by a new name basically every day. The characters were mostly ones from anime I had watched--Mello from Death Note, for instance. Why male characters? I don't know, I just never find myself liking girl characters. I never wanted to be a guy, though.\n  ","351321":"\n  I don't think things are that black and white. Some good people suffer, and some bad people get off the hook. Some good people do not suffer, and some bad people get what they deserve. It's probably some false perception, anyway. The only people I know who insist they're \"good\" are bad. Then you end up with bad people who whine because they suffer. But because they think they're good, and maybe sound persuasive enough to make people believe that, they seem like a \"good person who suffers more.\" But some truly good people suffer, yeah. And I'd say it's a matter of gaining wisdom\/experience. People can complain about their struggles or learn from them. It's up to them, really. Some bad people do more to not get caught (than other bad people). It's a matter of how cunning they are, I'd say. But some bad people are in plain sight yet no one cares. I think they will care in the end, however. I wouldn't even suggest that all bad people deserve to suffer. I believe in rehabilitation over punishment. I do not believe in the death penalty. As for happiness, well, it's reliant on perceptions. You can be poor and still be happy, be in jail and still be happy, etc. Or you can dwell on all the bad things. It's how you choose to see your life.\n  ","351322":"\n  When my lover is offline for too long (I'm the type to spiral, so it's like omg, what if she died?), any kind of conflict, when someone says something ambiguous to me, getting yelled at, hallucinations, being somewhere that has many bugs, being stared at, hearing people whispering, hearing footsteps in my house, being around a bunch of moving cars....\n  ","351323":"\n  I think it's fine. It's a transition phase, I'd say--around ages 17 and 22. But the brain (supposedly) does not stop developing until 25, so you have years to mature, nonetheless. Some suggest it does not stop developing until 30+, even. I wouldn't say youth is an excuse to make a bunch of bad decisions, but the decision making part of the brain is still rather undeveloped. As long as you are focused on improving. I would say that represents maturity more than anything. Immaturity would be accepting things as they are\/not wanting to change. Don't worry about always making the right choices, because you aren't expected to. Just aspire to make better ones in the future.\n  ","351324":"\n  Eh, if you are 18 and a senior in high school, you are legally an adult, sure, but I think people would argue that going off to college is the start of adulthood. You can also be 18 and in college, though. At the same time, not everyone even goes to college, so it depends on independence more than anything. But people are also on varying psychological\/developmental levels at that age. For instance, boys mature slower. So basically, it comes down to how mature you think you are, as well as whether you feel independent or not. I'd say it's normal to feel lost, though.\n  ","351325":"\n  People do not understand how attractions work. Not only that there are different types or degrees of feeling but that EVERYONE has a preference of some sort. If someone is attracted to the same sex, a certain age group, etc., it does not mean they can't have a preference when it comes to appearance and such. They are not attracted to everyone in that group. This logic seems to fly over people's heads.\n  ","351326":"\n  I think it's childish to have a black and white way of thinking and to believe that if someone commits a \"wrong\" action then they deserve to suffer forever. But if we're being hypothetical, probably hell, lmao. Not because I do bad things but because people would consider my very existence to be \"sinful.\" I think it'd be cooler than people make it out to be, though. Just a bunch of devious people together, in this place that probably looks like the Nether in Minecraft. I'd be discussing life stories with people.\n  ","351327":"\n  1. Showing humility\/being modest (especially if you want to get a job and such)\n  \n  2. Confiding in others\n  \n  3. Being honest no matter what\n  \n  4. Focusing on the present\/letting go of the past\n  \n  5. Thinking before you speak\n  \n  6. Cutting off toxic friends\/family members\/etc.\n  \n  7. Finding a creative outlet for negative feelings\n  \n  8. Not overworking yourself (but also not doing too little)\n  \n  9. Having a sense of order in life (through a schedule, through taking care of your needs, and so on)\n  \n  10. Trying new things\n  \n  Well, they may not be the wisest of all, but I think they are useful.\n  ","351328":"\n  I'll be frank: this seems like a silly\/immature mindset to have at your age. Your tendencies shouldn't be justified by OCD. I don't believe your meds made you healthy. It sounds like you could be a controlling person who is trying to find excuses for it\/make it out to be a good thing because you're just trying to be \"protective.\" And I'm sorry if this sounds mean. I have OCD, myself, but I don't think this is a healthy way of thinking, even keeping that condition in mind. Read about unhealthy enneagram type 6--you might relate.\n  ","351329":"\n  I think you act kind of obsessive. You wrote this: \"I know I can protect her against this cruel world while providing the love she needs forever.\" And it reminds me of this character quote, which is why I chose it. But that character is very unhealthy\/obsessive, you know... it's not wrong to want to protect someone, but it can become kind of excessive.\n  ","351330":"\n  Yes, there are many resources!\n  \n  I can summarize the types for you:\n  \n  Type 1 - Main desire is moral correctness\/being correct in general, main fear is moral decline\/being wrong.\n  \n  Type 2 - Main desire is being loved\/helping others, main fear is being rejected and feeling helpless.\n  \n  Type 3 - Main desire is success\/being admired, main fear is failure\/being seen as pathetic.\n  \n  Type 4 - Main desire is having a special identity\/being seen as unique, main fear is being seen as boring\/having an uncertain identity.\n  \n  Type 5 - Main desire is knowledge, main fear is incompetence.\n  \n  Type 6 - Main desire is security, main fear is insecurity\/betrayal. (There is such thing as phobic and counterphobic when it comes to type 6... essentially the unhealthy 6 projects on to others, is vicious, and so forth)\n  \n  Type 7 - Main desire is having fun\/being happy, main fear is boredom\/negativity. (Optimistic type)\n  \n  Type 8 - Main desire is being in control (of environment and self), main fear is losing control.\n  \n  Type 9 - Main desire is peace, main fear is conflict.\n  \n  The types each have a wing, those being either of the numbers beside them. For instance, a type 8 can have a 7 or 9 wing. This means a type 8 can have traits of a 7 or traits of a 9. A type 9 has an 8 or 1 wing, a type 2 has a 1 or 3 wing, etc. The wings cannot be different than either side number. You cannot be 9w4 or 8w3. Everyone has a tritype--a type in the heart triad (2, 3, or 4), a type in the head triad (5, 6, or 7), and a type in the gut triad (8, 9, or 1). My triad, for example, is 962, meaning 9 is my predominant type, 6 is my second type, and 2 is my last type. My wings are 9w1, 6w5, and 2w1 (I suggested 2w3 in the past, but I think you can have two types with the same wing).\n  \n  Anyway, there are various enneagram tests, but I wouldn't recommend them over reading about the types themselves and identifying which ones you agree with most. The site crystalknows.com seems to have a reliable test, though. They got my enneagram type correctly, while other sites do not.\n  \n  Here are some resources to get started:\n  \n\n   https:\/\/hedjumacation.net\/considerations\/uniqueness\/temperament\/enneagram\/\n  \n\n\n   https:\/\/www.9types.com\/writeup\/Theory20.htm\n  \n\n  There is a book called Discovering Your Personality Type by Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson, and I find it useful for beginners. There is an enneagram test in it that you can fill out. It explains how the different types can become healthy, what kind of relationship problems they may have, etc. It also goes into detail about the instinctual variants (sx, sp, and so).\n  \n  The whole triad\/wing thing can get confusing for people, so I think you should start off with finding your type itself (1, 2, 3, etc.), then seeing which wing type you relate to more. People often say they relate to several types, and that's normal, given the triad. Wings and the triad just explain why you relate to multiple types.\n  ","351331":"\n  No problem. You can also figure out your enneagram type and read about it. Enneagram focuses on your main desire\/fear, and the integration into peace or disintegration into stress. It identifies what stresses you out (personally) and how to manage it. It's simpler and more applicable than something like MBTI. It's used in workplaces and life coaching.\n  ","351332":"\n  Well, not really, unless it concerns me. You have to help your partner, if they are not in the best state. My OCD is mostly just an annoyance. I had a compulsion to watch 27+ episodes of anime a day, so I could not visit a friend or anything (always too busy). I felt anxious whenever my schedule was interrupted. My compulsions are not as extreme anymore--things like repeatedly checking that a bracelet has not fallen off, or not touching doorknobs with my bare hands. My obsessive thoughts do not ruin friendships\/have not ruined my relationship. If someone is judging you for what you cannot change, you shouldn't be friends with them, or be in a relationship with them. If they are dwelling on their own past and their own things that cannot be changed, you should be there for them. That's what I think.\n  ","351333":"\n  My delusions are common ones. That I'm being watched, that my food is being poisoned, etc. Paranoid delusions, delusions of persecution. I have had some unusual ones--that bugs live inside my body and are creating a colony. I thought there was a man living in the wall of my closet, and that he took over my mind. Well, I'm an odd type of person. I did not share my delusions with people, did not impose them on anyone. My parents didn't know about them until I explicitly told them. When you think of a schizophrenic, you think of someone crazy who goes around ranting about having special powers and such. I kept things to myself, though. I did not appear irrational or illogical on the surface. I felt very detached from reality, however. How I felt was a great juxtaposition from how I presented myself, on this subject. I find it hard to openly lose composure. My grades haven't suffered from any symptoms, I've never had a psychotic episode in public, etc. I'm a very suppressed and seemingly collected person. The delusions made me distrust people, but they did not impact relations on a significant scale. I've been more affected by the lack of empathy I experienced for a long time. It's given people this false, fixed image of me: one of someone who is immoral, deranged, and so on. But the empathy has developed significantly these past few years. I'm someone who is prone to extremes, either all or nothing. So, on the contrary, I now tend to feel TOO MUCH empathy, and cry over the smallest things. The derealization\/depersonalization I experienced were the outcome of the hallucinations and delusions. I've had a difficult time in public places, and sometimes just around other people in general, despite medicine. I become rather catatonic, and start having auditory hallucinations. But none of these things are as bad as they were in the past. And people oddly do not notice them, or remark on them. I am very good at fitting in, I guess? Even though several things are off.\n  ","351334":"\n  Well, if we're thinking in terms of evolution, sure. But I think people should wait for love, personally. We aren't like other creatures, who have to perform dances and such to attract a mate. I mean, I wasn't seeking a relationship, but I ended up in one. You never know what will happen, really. Though I understand that there's this (perceived?) social pressure on men to make the first move, while women are expected to wait. That's silly, though. People should wait or actively seek as they please, without regard for expectations\/gender norms. Hm, but then you would call yourself indifferent more than hopeless (when it comes to recognition being undesirable), I think.\n  ","351335":"\n  Yes, that must be what differentiates it from other fields. Other fields rely more on theories, like chemistry, but given that psychological things originate from the brain (something concrete), the brain is able to be studied, and analyses can be made. There are some interesting things that deserve greater study--vision issues among schizophrenics, for instance.\n  ","351336":"\n  You can consider it in two ways. \"Hopeless romantic\" is a term, but it consists of two words. A person can be both hopeless and romantic--hopeless not necessarily in romance but in life itself. Similarly, a hopeful romantic is just someone who is hopeful and romantic. I would consider myself to be a hopeful romantic. I'm not single or looking for a relationship, but I think I'm hopeful and romantic. I write love poems and such. However, we can consider \"hopeless romantic\" and \"hopeful romantic\" as terms rather than individual words. A hopeless romantic, to me, is someone who has either given up on romance altogether or wants what they cannot have. A hopeful romantic, by contrast, is someone who is wishing for romance and\/or is actively seeking it.\n  ","351337":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qfcnciP1yO0&ab_channel=BenoitPioulard-Topic\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351338":"\n  Yeah, might as well make use of my passions instead of pursuing only one, monetarily speaking. I had some other jobs in mind in the past, like being a detective or officer in narcotics. I really like research on drugs. But these jobs sound too demanding for what they're worth, I guess. I value free time. I've been interested in psychology since I was probably around 8, and it heightened around 13-14. It's good that you've discovered your passion, despite the timing. I think people try to get into the field for the wrong reasons--to help themselves (no regard for helping others), to learn to manipulate well, or because \"the human mind is so interesting.\" It's fine if they go into research with these interests in mind (but I wouldn't recommend psychology for manipulators, of course), though they tend to have actual counseling in mind, which is the issue. I suppose it's alright to initially have superficial thoughts about psychology and then study it and expand on these thoughts, but it seems to be one of those fields that people regret majoring in, because they never cared much to begin with. Anyway, I'm rambling, sorry. That's true.\n  ","351339":"\n  Eh, it mostly depends on when you choose to have children. You should be financially stable before starting a family. Of course, that isn't a always predictable matter. People have accidental pregnancies, or lose their job while pregnant, so while they were financially stable in the beginning, they are not by the time the baby is born. That's not really my concern, though. I'm in a same sex relationship, so there's no chance of pregnancy without a sperm donation. And I'll have several sources of income--psychology, book writing, translating, taxidermy, photography, and some other side hobbies to make money from. My partner is someone of various ambitions, too, so the finances will work out, I think.\n  ","351340":"\n  I'm unhealthy even with medicine, heh. But not to the extent that I used to be. Not necessarily. Maybe not greater relationship opportunities, but greater opportunities in other areas. Though, I don't believe in breakups and such. Well, there's no use in thinking about it now. What's done is done, after all. Who knows, maybe you can get back together with her in the future.\n  ","351341":"\n  Some people would argue that monogamy\/relationships are unnatural, though. I wouldn't, personally. Not really. Someone who is being abused in a relationship would probably feel miserable. It's not their fault that they feel that way. Of course, they are responsible for leaving the relationship, in that case, but people have a tendency to cling to both unhealthy habits and unhealthy individuals. That makes sense... but it's best to not think of the past in the context of regret.\n  ","351342":"\n  I think I reject it rather than running from it. I reject anyone's feelings for me if they aren't those of my girlfriend. I am crude to anyone who expresses having a crush on me. But is a crush truly love? Doubtful. Do I run from love in my relationship? No, I am quite affectionate, and I accept affection in return. I find it unpleasant to talk of loving family members. I guess I run from that love, to a degree. I struggle to say \"I love you\" back.\n  ","351343":"\n  Well, not really... some \"natural\" things include reproduction and killing prey for food. Following these things doesn't mean you will be happy. People get married, have kids, and get divorced, for example. It's better to be happy on your own than miserable in a relationship. What is most natural is satisfying your needs, and I think happiness is a need. You have to learn to be happy without anyone else's help. Of course, that's difficult, though. At least for those who have tasted what it's like to be with someone.\n  ","351344":"\n  Publish books\/poems, get a psychology degree and become a clinical psychologist, photograph abandoned places around the world, taxidermize animals, translate novels and publish translations, master roller skating, get married, move and have a great house, have kids, create a game, make a documentary, get what is necessary to become a YouTuber\/make videos, learn origami, create and sell leaf pressing art, learn to paint and draw, sew stuffed animals, become a good cook, learn to knit, birdwatch and take photos of those birds, learn about different rocks and minerals, maybe animate something... anyway, I have many plans.\n  ","351345":"\n  Ignorance. People choose not to educate themselves on things. It's more convenient to repeat what everyone else hears than to take the time to do your own research. I see even the people who claim to be open-minded and hate ignorance saying ignorant and close-minded things. Few people are genuinely open-minded. Everyone should make a habit of looking into the validity of different things.\n  ","351346":"\n  I mean, it kind of is. People have a tendency to wallow in negative feelings instead of getting better, because that sort of thing is addicting. They have the ability to feel better, through things such as perception changes or medicine, but they reject such things and choose to suffer. That's referring to mental health, though. Things like a terrible financial or environmental situation can't really be helped, thus you aren't choosing to suffer. But when people use the word suffer, they tend to be thinking of mental health\/mental illness(es). I have several mental illnesses, myself, but I don't like the phrase \"I suffer from (insert conditions).\" It makes me sound weak and helpless. I'm not disabled from these conditions. I can function just fine, due to medicine and personal will. These aren't minor conditions. Do I let these things impact school? No, I get all A's, and take advanced classes. Do I let these things impact my health? No, I brush my teeth and shower daily. You can wallow in your despair, in your symptoms, or move on. I do my work even when having a panic attack or going into a psychotic state. If I can do that, other people can, as well. I know it is difficult, but I also know they have it in them to do it.\n  ","351347":"\n  Something like this, lol. I love old cars.\n  ","351348":"\n  Grounding techniques. Remember that the past is the past, and it's time to move on. You can't truly live your life, or appreciate it, if you're always dwelling on the past. Use your mistakes as inspiration for growth, instead of seeing them as something harmful. Emotional stagnation leads you nowhere. This would be easier for someone with a high Se function, like myself.\n  ","351349":"\n  Yes, a fear of bugs, needles, fire, and diseases. My fear of bugs has been so bad that I can't leave the house... I think it's better than it used to be, though. I also hallucinate bugs. The fear of needles probably stems from my fear of pain. For some reason I believe I will die by fire... whenever I see a big one, I feel anxious. But these fears are still nothing compared to the fear of bugs, thus I wonder if I would call them phobias. To me, a phobia has to bring distress (and I mean distress on a daily basis). I have a form of OCD in which I get obsessive thoughts about diseases, particularly STDs. I once believed touching a marker after someone else touched it would give me HIV, for instance. Even if I simply see blood, without touching it, I fear I have contracted HIV. I logically know that you cannot get an STD so easily, but well, it's an irrational fear. Sometimes a person accidentally spits when they talk, and it gets on me, and I convince myself it gave me hepatitis. I think like 1\/4 of people with OCD have these kind of thoughts. And I don't take meds for that condition, so. :\/\n  ","351350":"\n  With friends and strangers, direct. In love, probably a combination of all. I'm not sure what exactly avoidant signifies, though. I mean, I avoid conflict at all costs, for instance. But another meaning of avoidant is ignoring\/\"avoiding\" how someone else feels. I don't think I'm like that, though? If they are mad, then yeah, I guess.... At my worst I'm a hidden messenger. I start talking in cryptic ways.\n  ","351351":"\n  Strange.\n  ","351352":"\n  I believe people naturally imitate others. They will stand like them, use their tone of voice, and so on. Others deliberately imitate, through mocking the person's words and such. I do think naturally\/harmlessly imitating improves social skills. If you act like someone through borrowing their mannerisms while interacting with them, they will probably like you more. And that's fine, no worries! You can give when you have more.\n  ","351353":"\n  Thanksgiving is a holiday rooted in the suffering of indigenous people. It is commonly romanticized, with portrayals of pilgrims having a pleasant feast with Native Americans. However, any educated person knows that was not the case. The Europeans took over this land and slaughtered the natives. It isn't a holiday to be celebrated. But most people, I assume, do not care much about the actual celebration (that is, feasting with the false pilgrim\/native encounter in mind); they just like the food.\n  ","351354":"\n  I think it depends on the hardship. If you get lung cancer from smoking, that's your fault, and it isn't about life being unfair. Other things, like being born into poverty, are a matter of unfortunate probability, and thus things being unfair. Probability is about luck. Decisions, on the other hand, are personal and a matter of self control and freedom.\n  ","351355":"\n  It's just my household eating together, and my girlfriend. I doubt anyone will be visiting. People shouldn't have gatherings at this time, anyway. We'll eat some great food and desserts. Looking forward to the stuffing and pie. \ud83c\udf41\n  ","351356":"\n  Here's a list of my hobbies:\n  \n  Roller skating\n  \n  Reading about birds (want to get into birdwatching)\n  \n  Writing\n  \n  Reading manga\n  \n  Watching Kubz Scouts videos\n  \n  Playing horror games\n  \n  Playing old flash games\n  \n  Playing VNs (mostly yaoi ones)\n  \n  Reading about MBTI\n  \n  Reading about enneagram\n  \n  Reading about astrology\n  \n  Watching porn\n  \n  Reading memoirs (usually about mental disorders)\n  \n  Taking care of plants\n  \n  Doodling (not so much now that I'm not in school)\n  \n  Reading about drugs\n  \n  Reading about abandoned places\n  \n  Want to get into taxidermy, improve sewing\n  \n  Translating\n  \n  Sometimes watching anime\/a show\/a movie\n  \n  Eating spicy ramen (it's a hobby, yeah)\n  \n  Watching YouTube videos in general\n  \n  Going on Twitter (nice bird pictures)\n  \n  Finding new words (I love dictionaries)\n  \n  Answering things on Ask\n  \n  Bowling (sometimes)\n  \n  Playing mini golf (sometimes)\n  \n  I also want to press leaves and make jewelry in the future.\n  ","351357":"\n  I mean, people can do it before they get married, but I don't see the point of doing it with someone you do not plan on spending your life with... you can spend your life with someone without ever getting married, though. Then again, I also don't believe in ever having a second lover. True devotion is only being with one person in your lifetime. But I can't impose that idealism on other people. They do what they want. Autonomy.\n  ","351358":"\n  They love playing with these cotton balls. This is a random pic of them from Google. You can buy several toys but they'll always go after these balls, as well as things like Dum Dums. They slide them across the floor.\n  ","351359":"\n  Well, I see both a therapist and psychiatrist, so there's that. It's important to appreciate the little things in life, and to go on a journey of inner peace, and peace with the world. People often hate the world, but because this is too painful to accept or live with, they internalize the hatred. Some mental illnesses do not require meds, in my opinion, and can be overcome without them (meds can make those conditions even worse). But meds placate my hallucinations, so I don't really struggle with them (unless I stop taking meds, which I do not plan on doing). I take medicine for my extreme moods, too, but does it help much, I'm not sure. Depressive episodes are usually caused by, or exacerbated by, cognitive distortions. These are also the catalyst for my catatonia and auditory hallucinations (both of which I get despite meds). I would recommend reading about these distortions, seeing how they apply to your life, and rectifying them. I strongly believe in the fact that perceptions influence emotions, and fixing these perceptions can change how you feel. When it comes to OCD and fears, systematic desensitization is best.\n  ","351360":"\n  I think I've been productive because of my belief that feelings should not interfere with responsibilities. It is also my belief that people should be given the benefit of the doubt, which is why I've given some individuals whom I knew would become bad a chance at being friends with me. :\/ I think writing should be spontaneous rather than planned, which is why my stories are the way they are.\n  ","351361":"\n  I'm always honest. I also do not lose interest in things easily, and I have many goals and passions. I appreciate things no one else likes, and can see beauty in everything. It's easy for me to focus on the good things in my past instead of dwelling on bad things. I do not break promises, and I fulfill anything I have to, setting my feelings aside. I understand how people function, and can predict what they will say and do. I do not reciprocate malice.\n  ","351362":"\n  Balancing what I want to do and what I must do. I don't believe in being productive at all times, regarding school work and other obligations. Everyone has an obligation to make themselves happy, and to be productive in that sense. I want to be productive through both means, so I fulfill responsibilities while also fulfilling the responsibility of my own well-being. This consists of things such as eating my favorite spicy ramen each week, reading only what interests me, and so on.\n  ","351363":"\n  Yes, if it makes something easier, or if you have some groundbreaking idea that cannot be executed within the existing rules. Some rules exist for our safety, but others are more of a guide. This guide can be changed and made more convenient. For instance, your teacher may tell you to solve math problems in a certain way, but the way does not matter, as long as you get the same answer. In that case, the rule is more of a guide. There are rules everywhere, including when it comes to parenting or relationships. Some rules that should never be broken are the following: do not abuse your children, do not cheat on your significant other, and do not gaslight. These are immoral actions, after all. But math rules are not immoral, so they can be broken. If that makes sense. I suppose bending rules has more to do with following the rules and slightly deviating from them? You may follow a recipe (which is essentially a set of cooking rules) but decide to add your own ingredients. And that's great, as long as you like what you've created.\n  ","351364":"\n  My mom hit a rock with her car and had to get it towed, so we ended up with little time to visit the mansion. It was a nice place, though. A woman who worked there gave me a free book, and an officer gave me a free collector's coin (since it was my birthday). I ate some Chinese food in the hotel because we couldn't drive back to the ramen place. I got some nice presents! Several games, a bunch of Gogo's Crazy Bones, a couple books, etc. The trip has been interrupted by not having a car. :\/ But we have a rental now.\n  ","351365":"\n  Thanks. Yeah, I don't think people should be very restricted. Laws are in place for that sort of thing, anyway. Everyone should think for themselves and develop their own sense of right and wrong instead of abiding by an already established moral code that is flawed and outdated. People can be divided more by prejudiced and non-prejudiced than \"sinful\" and good. To me it's immoral to believe anyone deserves to burn for all eternity in some afterlife. I also think the death penalty is immoral. Because these things aren't natural, they're man-made. People enforce the death penalty, and people create the concept of an afterlife. These things do not exist on their own, unlike groups of people. My morality revolves around natural\/unnatural things. By unnatural I do not mean things that are commonly disagreed with but things that are cruel and enforced by people themselves. Like slavery, for example, that is unnatural.\n  ","351366":"\n  I think of everything as part of nature. Even aberrations are natural. People try to ascribe morality to everything, but anything natural cannot be immoral (Example: homosexuality). I believe in what is tangible. Other creatures do not appear to have a god, so there is no reason for humans to believe in one, either. I don't rely on some god's moral code. I like religions that focus on individualism, such as Buddhism, rather than ones that make an effort to restrict human nature with the concept of sins and such. But I do not belong to any religion. Some just make more sense than others. I do not believe in an afterlife, but I do believe in reincarnation.\n  ","351367":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EYs0kLMuXDE&list=PL93F563E2742C3435&ab_channel=stripedlady\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351368":"\n  1.

They were not well written because I was young, anyway. They were mostly about demons\/angels and such, nothing interesting. I later wrote a story about two boys in an insane asylum. It kind of went in a strange direction, because I was writing it solely for my own entertainment. It transitioned from being about the asylum to being about the main character and a drug addict. There's a lot of murder and such. And the characters are gay. It's 46 chapters long, and the only story I ever actually finished (it says 47 chapters, but I accidentally skipped one while counting, lol). It's not very well written, either, considering I started it when I was 13 and finished it when I was 14, but it's interesting and entertaining, nonetheless. People tend to like it a lot, for what it is. I've reread it multiple times. I also wrote a little incestuous short story about a boy who is in love with his mother. It was supposed to be an entire story, but I took a (possibly permanent) break from it, so for now it's just a short story. There is a book I've been writing since 2017 with the intent of publication. I'm on chapter 11 right now (out of around 30-35). I expect to finish it in 2026, but I love having someone to read it while I'm writing it! It's about a pedophile serial killer and his stalker coworker, who is in love with him and wants to eat people. It's very complex and the best thing I've written so far. My writing style completely changed, from being very literal to highly metaphorical. I incorporate metaphors from many areas of life, such as chemistry, biology, physics, psychology, sociology, meteorology, pottery, religion, math, history, music, astrology, physiology, psychiatry, economics, topography, oceanography, architecture, cosmetology, zoology, art, food, and so forth. I dedicate a lot of time into finding the perfect words for any given situation. This novel goes more in depth with human relations, social deviations, etc. The characters' emotions also tend to be a direct reflection of my own mood while writing--for instance, if a character exhibits jealousy, it's because I was feeling jealous at the time of writing that part. The beginning chapters aren't very good, because I was still transitioning into my new style, but the latest chapters are.\n  ","351371":"\n  I privated it, so I can't really show.

Humans are more socially complex, and things like validation stem from that, whether it be validation that they fit in, that they're wanted, that they even deserve to live, and so on. Hardships create a desire for validation. Someone may ask themselves if they deserve love after a harsh breakup. It's a normal human desire. By normal I do not mean healthy, but it comes with being human. Its origin is self-doubt, or not feeling accepted by society. Other animals are incapable of such feelings, but humans are prone to them. A degree of self-doubt is healthy, though it can become severe. A desire for validation is created by society itself. Validation for grades, work performance, and so on. Society teaches people that they are not good enough unless they are perfect. Perfection is intangible, and it's important to understand that and take pride in your work, regardless of how others perceive it.\n  ","351376":"\n  One of the biggest challenges is probably having a mental illness. I guess in a sense my hallucinations and such have made life interesting, but also very bad. I overcame them not in the sense that they were cured but that I never let my condition interfere with my responsibilities. I think I have learned much about life through the lens of metaphors created by psychosis. I can see anything in a completely different light and make connections I would not have otherwise made.\n  ","351377":"\n  I'm not sure what greater implies. Wealthier? More intelligent? More accomplished? I do not think everyone can become wealthy. That tends to require certain prerequisites--living in a wealthy country, having wealthy parents, getting a well-paying job, and so on. Not everyone has the same educational opportunities, either. But people can accomplish many things regardless of upbringing and other factors. Being \"great\" or a \"failure\" are perception based.

Let's say you have acne, for instance, you could start thinking acne is beautiful instead of ugly. Because people are conditioned to find certain things ugly when they aren't. It helps to agree with the nice things people say about you, because denying those things is a form of self-rejection, and you create a cycle of loathing this way.

I think culture has to do with creating things, and to create you must have supplies\/an imagination.\n  ","351395":"\n  Well, like I said, you can determine something is immoral if it harms someone else. Of course slavery harmed people, as well as internment camps. Back then it took guts to realize and express that these things were wrong. Most people simply accepted them and didn't care. Even if something is legal, it can be harmful. Harmful = immoral. But say, alcohol is legal after a certain age, and people wouldn't consider it to be immoral, because you harm your own body with it rather than harming someone else. Drinking and driving, on the other hand, would be immoral, because you can severely injure someone else due to your own recklessness. If you are causing someone else pain\/suffering, chances are you are doing something wrong.\n  ","351396":"\n  You can't really judge someone's morals, that's the thing. People judge based on comparisons. \"That person has different morals than me, therefore they're weird and 'dangerous.'\" It ironically often comes from the people who act like they're so open-minded. People can agree on morals as a collective--murder is bad, for instance. But if you have a moral not based on social values and what you've been taught while growing up, it must be individual based. Let's say you think murder is good, then you very evidently have a socially unacceptable moral. The thing is that laws generally exist to back common morals, so you can judge your own based on such laws. Murder is illegal, for example, so if you condone it then you have an unusual moral. I guess you should ask yourself if your morals agree with laws or not. But then some things are immoral without being illegal. Cheating in a relationship, cheating on a test, backstabbing a friend, etc. And we know these things are immoral because they harm someone or involve deceit. Those are two other factors to decide the morality of something.\n  ","351397":"\n  I'm a strong believer in people doing whatever they want, but that's actually not a good thing. What distinguishes humans from other animals is that humans have morals. You become quite primitive without them. Human nature should not be suppressed, but you shouldn't stray too far from morality. However, morality should be individualistic rather than social based. Think for yourself and develop your own sense of right and wrong. I think people should protect each other, sure, but only if it's wanted. No protection leads to anarchy. Wanting to be safe is a basic desire that the majority of people have, if not everyone. In other words, laws are necessary to keep human nature in check, but suppression can lead to distress. So it's kind of a difficult situation.\n  ","351398":"\n  - Focusing on the present instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. You have limited control in life, so give up on trying to have more control.\n  \n  - Enjoying the small and special things in life. It isn't about something being major or simple but special to you. We all want excesses and things we cannot have, so instead we should take interest in little things that are overlooked.

I can't say anything because my writing is a direct reflection of me as a person. And I just wish they would read it to understand me better.\n  ","351409":"\n  I just find them very hypocritical. They go around preaching not to hate people for what they didn't choose, yet they go around hating incest, beastiality, etc., like people choose which sexual\/romantic feelings to have. There is nothing wrong with homosexuality, yes--I'm in a same sex relationship, myself--but there is nothing wrong with more \"controversial\" attractions, either. They condemn one group and not the other, because one makes them more uncomfortable than the other. If something makes you uncomfortable, it's an indication that you know little about it.

I switched to actual online school, though, so I won't have to go back. I'm not sure if you'd call it lockdown.\n  ","351411":"\n  There is no true diagnosis of what is real, taking into account that there are hallucinations of each sense. For instance, when I hallucinate bugs, I believe they are truly there, but anyone else would say otherwise. You can hallucinate smells and such, too. Someone with eye snow perceives the world differently from someone without it. Generally one believes anything based on the five senses is real, but even your senses can betray you. The world is as you perceive it to be, but this world may not be perceived the same way as someone else. Everyone has their personal reality, but some things are concrete.\n  ","351412":"\n  It's getting better, I think. I have a form of OCD in which I am irrationally afraid that touching something someone else has touched, or just certain surfaces in general, will give me an STD, and that these objects\/surfaces are contaminated. I've even wanted to wear gloves at all times because I am so afraid of germs. I often have obsessive thoughts related to diseases and such, but I never act on anything. Obviously I am not wearing gloves, for instance.\n  ","351413":"\n  I make mistakes, too, lol. But nothing very bad. I haven't betrayed a friend, I've never cheated, and so on. Though I did block a girl after she sent me a document of her life story, without bothering to read it. I just didn't like her as a person. I also threw away a boy's invitation for me to go to the school dance with him, also without reading it, and he cried. He kept following me around school every day and lied to people that we were dating, so I had every right to be mean.\n  ","351414":"\n  It depends on how long they did it for, and how bad it was. I forgave one man who harassed me, because there was a misunderstanding. A girl lied to him that I was harassing her, so he started harassing me in retaliation. He later apologized once he discovered I was innocent, and I forgave him because he sincerely felt bad. Will I ever forgive the girl who has been harassing me for years, no.

When I was 11 or 12 my parents started constantly fighting. When I was 13 a friend abandoned me. I got a concussion and started to hallucinate, and men sexually harassed me online. Another friend abandoned me. When I was 14 I went very unstable from guilt over my attraction, and I hallucinated on a constant basis. I met my lover and got on medicine around the same time. When I was 15 I started being immensely harassed and ended up in a mental hospital. I self harmed for a long time, until after I was 16. And after that is a blur, but I feel better now.

There is no need to investigate unless they have a strange past. You should investigate if they had lovers in the past, but if you are their first love then there is nothing to investigate. You shouldn't force yourself to be with someone if you dislike their past. At the same time, it's silly to say you love someone and then reject them when you learn more about them.\n  ","351425":"\n  Like I've said before, if I didn't believe in it then why would I be in a relationship right now? I think love is a permanent feeling. It is possible to fall \"out of love\" only if you never truly loved the person to begin with. I do not believe genuine love ever vanishes. Even if my lover potentially left me, I would only love her forever and never be with anyone else. Maybe it sounds idealistic to others, but this is what I believe. I was never interested in a relationship in the first place and thought I would never love anyone, and that no one would love me, either. But I have found my soulmate. I think people shouldn't bother searching for love. If it's meant to happen, it will happen, so just wait. I think people tend to have selfish\/superficial reasons for wanting to be in a relationship, which is precisely why all their relationships fail.

I wish my family was more stable, and that they would get to know me instead of going behind my back and trying to stalk me, finding people online who aren't even me and accusing me of being them. I don't like my legs, I wish they were different. I'm physically weak and practically always in some kind of pain. I wouldn't change my lover, nor my gentle side.

The purpose is not to know the meaning of those words but for them to make you feel a certain way. The difference between schizophrenics and non-schizophrenics is that non-schizophrenics look at words, while schizophrenics look through them. I view the world very metaphorically and want to convey my vision properly. Simplistic words, while convenient for you, cannot accurately convey the way I perceive things, the images I see in my head. Many words I use are ones I learned in school. Your inability to retain information is not a reflection of me trying to \"sound intelligent.\" If you are so bothered, I have even created multiple pages breaking down the meaning of each sentence that may be hard to understand. Words exist for someone's use. Rather than whining about your elementary level vocabulary, perhaps learn something new.\n  ","351429":"\n  Writing - I started reading fanfictions when I was about 8 or 9, and this inspired me to write my own. I should mention that the first story I worked on was not entirely my own, and in fact the beginning of it was largely plagiarized. Yes, I did apologize to the original author. I was young and did not understand what plagiarism was. I often forget that I started out writing fanfictions, because it was a long time ago. I added my own characters, however. For years I have been writing stories exclusively involving characters I created, and cannot fathom writing a fanfiction at this age.\n  \n  Playing video games - I don't know, I've just done it all my life, I can't remember the starting point.\n  \n  Translating - I started around May of this year. I wanted to read this French book but couldn't find the English translation of it (the version I did find was over $100), so I decided to translate it on my own, even though I'm not fluent in French.\n  \n  Drug\/abandoned places research - I got into these around the same time, in like 7th or 8th grade. I had a character who was obsessed with Nara Dreamland, so I went out of my way to read more about it. Intrigued by what I read, I ventured out to read about more abandoned places, even very obscure ones. I also had a character who was addicted to meth, and, wanting to present his symptoms realistically, I did extensive research on it. Like with Nara Dreamland, this particular drug research led to research on other drugs, too.\n  \n  Helping people - It's something I've been interested in for years. During 2017 in particular, I spent hours typing long messages to people in order to help them manage suicidal thoughts. My wrists became swollen from typing so much, but I still tried my best to help in 2018, too. I've since been focusing on my own problems, instead.

She is fluent in several languages and helps me with French, and she knows a lot about MBTI and can understand complex concepts well. I think I am simple in comparison.

This is the only reason why I miss school, I like learning new words in various classes.

It takes a lot not to be pessimistic when you are depressed.\n  ","351433":"\n  It's inevitable with the lack of research people are willing to put in. For instance, if you asked the majority of people, they would say a pedophile is attracted to teens, when actually they are attracted to prepubescent children. People throw words around with the belief that they mean a certain thing when they mean something completely different. And they are the same people who claim ignorance is terrible. Some people really think stomach fat protects the uterus, or that it takes 7 years for (body) cells to be replaced. Then they go around spreading misinformation. If they were actually educated then they wouldn't hold as many harmful preconceived notions. We are naturally judgmental, but we do not have to be.\n  ","351434":"\n  I do not believe in the concept of sins. Ignorance is bliss when it concerns people talking shit about you, because hearing what they are saying can destroy your mental health. Choosing to be ignorant about something because it \"disturbs\" you--the \"truth\" about something--is unfavorable. I think this kind of ignorance corrodes your so called \"open-mindedness.\" I find that the people who hate ignorance are very ignorant, and I can only chuckle at their hypocrisy from a distance. In general ignorance is good if it saves you from mental harm, but it is bad if it is causing someone ELSE harm.\n  ","351435":"\n  No, I literally never even leave my house, aside from sometimes during summer to go to the amusement park and such, and going to school is required during the year. I go out to eat sometimes (with my family), and go to appointments. I eat alone at lunch, I do group projects alone, and I have no friends or social life. I have a few friends online, most of whom I haven't talked to in probably over a year. I had a group of friends in middle school, but once I started high school I stopped having any friends.

The cooks were not wearing masks, and two customers did not wear them but didn't get kicked out for it. They have plastic things for picking up utensils, but people did not use them, regardless, so you have many people touching the same spatulas. I hope I haven't been infected from their negligence.\n  ","351438":"\n  Yeah. One guy told me my opinion mattered like 1\/4 of everyone else's because of my age. I do not actually remember if he said 1\/4, maybe it was 1\/3 or something instead, so excuse me if I have ever said a different fraction in the past. There were general insults like this one, as well as guys explicitly asking me for nudes and such despite knowing I was 13. When I stopped being open about my age, I stopped receiving harassment for it, but about a year and a half later, when I was 15, I started being accused of lying about my age, even though I wasn't even open about it anymore. First they were saying I was 20 something and pretending to be 17, even though I never even said I was 17, and now they insist I am 15 despite years passing. They act like my age defies time and I am permanently 15, like I've found the fountain of youth. I'm almost in college, I'm not in 10th grade anymore. And the fact that they are like 24+ and harassing someone who they think is 15 is very sad, to me. And they have some twisted, unfounded delusion that my lover is 30 something, even though she is not much older than me.\n  ","351439":"\n  In 2016, when two friends abandoned me, and when I got a concussion. In 2017, when I got on medicine for my hallucinations\/delusions, when I met my lover, and when some guy harassed me for something I didn't do and apologized for it. Some unknown time, when I started self harming. In 2018, when my lover visited me in person, when harassment from someone else became severe and I went to a mental hospital because I was very suicidal, when I was put on mood stabilizing medicine. In 2019, when I stopped using that terrible site, and when I stopped self harming. In 2020, when I was doxxed, and when I gained a sense of peace... hopefully it stays.\n  ","351440":"\n  It was horrendous. I hate my legs, but they forced us to wear shorts, which made me feel self-conscious and was a factor contributing to my eating disorder. The PE teachers forced me to run, too, despite a doctor note saying I couldn't because my ankles are fragile. As a result, I ended up getting a foot injury after running the mile and had to wear one of those special boots to heal it. I always tasted blood in my mouth after running, and I almost fainted. I never enjoyed any of the games they made us play, because I hate sports.\n  ","351441":"\n  Hm, you rarely see teens on here, though. Ageists are so annoying and spew generalizations when not every young person is immature and not every old person is mature, maturity and knowledge are both individual based.

Back when I was 13 (years ago, mind you), I was open about my age, and older men kept sexualizing me for it.

Despite it being several years ago, I am STILL being harassed for it.\n  ","351443":"\n  Online harassment got so bad that I stated I would stab myself in the stomach and had to go to the hospital over it. That wasn't even bad, though. I was already strangling myself practically every day because I was so suicidal, and attempted to hang myself more than once.

Oh, but this other person definitely chose to be this way, attack them.\" Double standards regarding sexuality versus paraphilia. This deluded mindset that paraphilias are more corrupt and \"devious,\" I suppose. It's all the same, to me. No one chooses who or what they have sexual feelings for, so no one should be attacked for any sort of sexual attraction. That is what you call equality.\n  ","351448":"\n  I do believe in zodiac sign compatibility. I think it's been true to my own experiences.

Similarly, I have had good experiences with female Pisces friends.\n  ","351449":"\n  I answered this a long time ago, and I would have to write a long rant once more.... So I will summarize. I became very detached from reality and lost the ability to sympathize with others, due to a sense of severe ostracism from society, along with my father's alcoholism and other stressors such as bug infestations that triggered visual hallucinations. Before this wave of depression and psychosis, I was quite cheerful and had a feeling of love for the world. I met my lover in 2016, though I did not talk to her much until 2017. Our relationship was unstable for a long time because we were both in an unhealthy state. Then came terrible online harassment in 2018, though I had been harassed before on many occasions, whether sexually harassed or just normally harassed. Anyhow, this harassment drove me extremely unstable and landed me in a mental hospital because I was so suicidal. I had started self harming around late 2017 (?) because I felt so distressed, and it didn't end until December of 2019, though I had a relapse in like March of 2020. Thanks to my lover, I was able to manage my sadistic feelings, and my desire to commit a crime because I had nothing to live for was quelled. After being on medicine for mental illness and experiencing her love and care, I regained my feelings of sympathy and fascination with the world, which were more intense than ever. Videos of paralyzed kittens made me sob, and they still do. I am so sensitive it's not even funny, I cry over people's pain all the time, and animals being in pain. I cry even when a plant I have loses a single leaf. Basically I am still a mess, but my emotional state has greatly improved. I feel peaceful, and I hope my lover feels the same way.\n  \n  But I guess this is long for a summary, lol.\n  ","351450":"\n\n   @vzno\n  \n\n  Omg how did I pass over you!!!!!

What my therapist says about my OCD is that I feel anxious and thus my mind creates compulsions completely unrelated to that anxiety. I may feel anxious about school and studying, so I develop a compulsion to keep checking that my phone is still in my backpack, or that my bracelet is still on my wrist. What do these things have to do with my studies? Nothing. You feel an internal sense of dissonance and your mind seeks control on the outside, which creates even more problems. Because then I have not only school anxiety but these checking compulsions I can't get rid of. I think our brain produces more problems if we cannot understand and solve the ones we already have. For instance, you might refuse to face your issues and overcome them, so you drink alcohol to distract yourself. Well, now you have a drinking problem as well as the problems you are attempting to run from. We as humans struggle to deal with certain things, and we face the consequences. The reason why I say certain problems in the beginning is because some things are simply out of your control. Like do I choose to have hallucinations in response to my environmental stressors, no, here it isn't a matter of running from anything. Though to a degree, perhaps, considering with the derealization\/depersonalization triggered by these hallucinations, I was \"detaching\" myself from reality, rather than remaining grounded and having to suffer from it. I think this detachment is even more insufferable, though. The mind has self-sabotaging defense mechanisms.\n  ","351453":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mJag19WoAe0\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351454":"\n  Exactly, this is why I think it's a form of self harm. Even if not visible, it is still internal harm. I'm very anti-alcohol because my father is an alcoholic and I've seen what it does to him. It just seems like a terrible thing. Maybe if you have it on major holidays then it's okay, but if you're drinking every week or every day then it's a problem.\n  ","351455":"\n  I think it probably happens with celebrities. You can see that someone is kind on camera, and you just know that they must be a great friend in real life. If you mean relationship-wise, I'm not attracted to people my age, so not really. I've only ever been in one relationship (the one I'm in right now), and I found her interesting, but she was the one who contacted me first, so I suppose the feeling would be the other way around. I did have crushes when I was younger, like 6 years old or so, but I've always been an obsessive person and thus wanted to learn everything about them.\n  ","351456":"\n  \"Deep down in the dark\n  \n  Loving you six feet underground\n  \n  Eternal love\n  \n  I'm loving you six feet underground\n  \n  I kiss your bleak lips part by part\n  \n  In light as in darkness\n  \n  My favorite pieces \u00e0 la carte\n  \n  In light as in darkness\n  \n  My love will last longer than death\n  \n  And night by night you'll be my skin and flesh\"\n  ","351457":"\n  Yeah. I mean, I wasn't okay before I was on medicine, I was very detached from reality and hallucinating on a constant basis. I was convinced that zombies were real, and that everyone around me was a robot and I was being experimented on. I rarely have visual hallucinations on medicine, but I hear voices whenever I become distressed. Delusions are rare, and I no longer feel detached from both my body and my surroundings, but I'm still paranoid, to a degree. I struggle with things like eye contact because I convinced myself people can read my thoughts just by looking into my eyes. And I still struggle with my moods, despite medicine. Someone being even slightly mad at me can trigger a breakdown, and the smallest arguments can lead to a psychotic episode where I become catatonic and such. Plus I take no medicine for OCD, since really the only medicine for it is antidepressants, which can have terrible side effects. My compulsions are mostly triggered at school, but obsessive thoughts are just there in general. I remember how when I went to the hospital, I was paranoid that touching a marker another person touched would give me an STD. My thoughts can be irrational like that. But in case you get the impression I am very dysfunctional in person and it's obvious to others that I have these problems, that's completely false. My parents had no clue what was going on until I explicitly told them. It's hard for me to express how I feel, and everything happens behind closed doors. The only person who has witnessed my psychotic episodes is my girlfriend. And my symptoms do not interfere with my school work, I study a lot and get good grades. I'm just your average person on the surface. I should note that I haven't self harmed in months, though. 2018 was the worst year. 2017 was very bad, and 2019 wasn't too good. 2020 has actually been fairly nice for me, even though most people probably hate this year. Anyway, I ranted too much, lol.\n  ","351458":"\n  Thanks! I'm trying my best. I even talked to a friend until he was the one that stopped replying (I figure because he is busy with work... I hope I didn't upset him somehow), instead of me. I'm not sure how to have conversations, I'm just so used to writing long messages trying to help people out of suicide. And I have wrist problems from typing so much. :\/ I talked to some British users back in the day, but I don't think I was ever really friends with them, so that would make you the first, too. \ud83d\ude0c\n  ","351459":"\n  Me reading the stupidest questions on here.\n  ","351460":"\n  You just figure out which functions you have and which order those functions are in. Like, INTJs have the functions Te, Ni, Fi, and Se, and do do ISFPs, ESFPs, and ENTJs. But all in different orders. INTJs have dominant Ni, meaning they are mainly focused on the future. ESFPs have dominant Se and are mainly focused on the present. ISFPs have dominant Fi and are mainly focused on personal values\/morals. ENTJs have dominant Te and are mainly focused on different goals and effectivity. It's basically a \"Which do I relate to most?\" type of thing, I guess. But it requires sufficient research, you can't just randomly decide on your type.\n  ","351461":"\n  Yes, the same people stay with you in each life. This explains why you may feel as if you've known someone all your life--you knew them in the past. Yes. And they are underrated, to me. Herons are so beautiful and graceful but overlooked. It would be nice to be a heron standing on a log, waiting for fish to swim by. Or a squirrel climbing trees and hiding food.\n  ","351462":"\n  I think that's more of a Hindu concept, though? I'm not sure if people can become animals. I quite like Buddhism, but I'm not a Buddhist. I think you are with the same people in each life. Your lover in this life might be your parent in the next, that sort of thing. That would explain incest. But if I could be an animal, I would want to be a squirrel or heron.\n  ","351463":"\n  The one I wrote from around 2016-2017 was about two boys in an insane asylum, but then it became about one of those boys and a drug addict, and it was just a big mess. BUT I finished it. The stories I wrote before that one are basically all gone because the writing site I used shut down without any warning. I started writing one in 2017 about a boy in love with his mother, but I gave up after one chapter. I've been writing another one since 2017, and I'm almost on chapter 11. It's about a serial killer pedophile and his stalker coworker who is in love with him and wants to eat people. I intend for it to be around 30-35 chapters, and I want to publish it.\n  ","351464":"\n  Yeah, but it comes out of nowhere. :\/ INTJ and ISFP are MBTI types, and 9w1 and 6w5 are enneagram types. MBTI types explain the cognitive functions you use to process the world--in my case Fi-Se-Ni-Te, in that order. The functions are complicated to describe. Fi is all about personal values and prioritizing them over social norms. Se is about living in the present and valuing physical sensations (someone with dominant Se would probably enjoy things like sports a lot, but mine is not dominant, so). Ni is about insight and focusing on the future, and it emphasizes a single goal. Te enjoys the end goal rather than enjoying the process of achieving that goal. Someone with Te is more decisive than someone with Ti. Te is also an objective function, while Ti is biased. The other functions are Fe, Si, and Ne. Those functions are not in my stack (but there are such things as a 5th function, 6th, 7th, and 8th... it gets convoluted). Enneagram is more about fears and desires. As a 9, my greatest desire is peace, and my greatest fear is conflict. I have a 1 wing, which means I also emphasize things like what is right\/wrong, and correcting myself and others. Ones are perfectionists. I am essentially a Nine with One traits. There are 9 enneagram types and 16 MBTI types. There are 3 enneagram type triads, those being gut (anger), head (fear), and heart (shame). Type 9 falls under the gut triad, so the unpleasant emotion I feel most often is anger. While an 8 is expressive of their anger, a 9 represses it. A 1's anger is often expressed through criticism. Eights are controlling and domineering people.\n  ","351465":"\n  Yeah, tinnitus is permanent ear ringing, I got it from an ear infection. I've never had the flu, but I get a cold like two or three times a year. I've had psoriasis all my life. For me it appears as scale-like dots on my arms that are very itchy. It comes near winter and then goes away for months. I had it in preschool and couldn't stop scratching it, so my arms bled and had to be completely bandaged. The teachers thought I was being abused. ;;;\n  ","351466":"\n  This bear. Yes, I just took this pic, haha.\n  ","351467":"\n  Thank you. Yeah, I barely read any books, but I like to think my style is original. It used to be quite different, but my writing became more metaphorical when mental illness hit.

I take pride in the more recent ones.\n  ","351468":"\n  Certainly.

Though people harass others and then wonder why they hate themselves so much. The energy you put out is simultaneously the energy you put in. Naturally you will have a negative perception of yourself if you possess a negative perception of others\/life itself. As I say, you must look on the outside before being able to look on the inside and appreciate yourself.\n  ","351473":"\n  It's all just stuff I do in my spare time. I used to do research on illegal drugs, namely meth, every single day for about a year, alongside research on abandoned locations. I do research on psychological conditions because I've had an interest in helping others with them, and I have mental illnesses, myself. I do research on various physical conditions and medications for my writing, as it is full of metaphors. I feel like by the end of it I might as well qualify to be a doctor with all the knowledge I pick up along the way. I've also been interested in pursuing detective work or being an officer in narcotics, but I've decided to be a psychologist as it is my predominant interest. Though I'm a workaholic, so I also plan to be a photographer, author, and taxidermist, and I'm translating a French book and plan to translate other books in the future. I'm only fluent in English, so it takes about an hour to translate a single page, though I do it every day. I'm not in university quite yet, but I will be soon.\n  ","351474":"\n  I am able to set my feelings aside to do my work, so even if I am distressed and having a psychotic episode, I still do my work properly. It seems like not many people are capable of this; their emotions overwhelm them and they get nothing done. I am very studious, and my photographic memory helps me. I also write well and thus score well on essays; I got a 5 (the highest score) on my AP lang exam, for instance. I can also read and type quickly. I'm not quite sure how my faults fare in regard to succeeding. I'm very conflict avoidant when it comes to arguments and basically have a breakdown whenever someone fights with me, but as I said, I do not let my state interfere with my work, so even when very unstable I get great grades. I am quite the determined person. But oh, there is one fault, like how I absolutely hate time limits, so while I am good at writing essays, I panic when I have to write one in 40 minutes. I also develop these compulsions related to school, such as repeatedly checking that my bracelet is still on, and checking that my phone hasn't fallen out of my backpack. But these compulsions do not get in the way of succeeding, so.\n  ","351475":"\n  I tried taking an antidepressant once and it gave me a big panic attack, and the next day I was unable to imagine anything; my mind was completely blank. There was one medication that made me nauseous all the time, and my pupils were constantly dilated on it. One gave me terrible tremors. I accidentally took too much of a certain medication (I think Seroquel, which I am still taking), and my entire body had this odd burning sensation. My vision became incredibly blurry, and I threw up in the sink (I was showering, at the time). Every now and then I have the same sensation (despite not taking too much), but it's rare these days. One morning while getting ready for school I ended up throwing up from it. But yeah, those are my unpleasant medicine experiences. I have practically no side effects from Seroquel, aside from the occasional nausea and burning, and my feet feel restless from it sometimes. I have absolutely no side effects from Lamictal whatsoever, I recommend it in place of antidepressants (for those who are bipolar).\n  ","351476":"\n  My plant is growing.\n  ","351477":"\n  A black and white way of thinking is an example of a cognitive distortion. For instance, \"I will never date someone again.\" Using words like \"never\" or \"always\" signifies a cognitive distortion. \"I was in a bad relationship and I feel discouraged now, but I will try again in the future\" is not a cognitive distortion. So, I understand how you feel, but I think you will feel better by alleviating this perception issue. You did not say \"never,\" but \"done with dating\" still has that implication, in my opinion.\n  ","351478":"\n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/C0ZffIh0-NA\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  I really like this one.\n  ","351479":"\n  I'll tell you if she does. Lol, it doesn't work in decimals, the types go from 1-9, and you can have a wing, which gives you traits of another type. So you could be 8w9 or 9w8. 9w8 is more assertive\/aggressive than 9w1, which is essentially the most peaceful type of all that absolutely hates conflict. Similarly, 8w9 is less expressive with anger than 8w7. And you have something called a tritype, meaning you have traits of three different enneagram types and their wings. I believe mine to be 9w1, 6w5, 2w3. But maybe 2w1 at the end, not sure if you can have the same wing twice or not.\n  ","351480":"\n  I think I'm indifferent to most anime characters, and I can't think of any I hate with a passion. Some make more foolish decisions than others. Why underdog? Well, I am not good at making sweets like him, and can't relate to his other crafts, but I consider myself to be a childish yet serious person. And we both love cats. I'm not necessarily afraid of dogs, but I hate them.\n  ","351481":"\n  If you mean just normal rock, I'm not really sure, I was just going off the genres Google said certain groups I listen to fall under. I mostly like industrial rock\/post-hardcore rock\/experimental rock\/industrial metal, I'm not a fan of just plain metal. KMFDM is an industrial rock\/industrial metal band, and I really like their song Godlike, as well as K.M.F, Son of a Gun, Megalomaniac, Professional Killer, Anarchy, WWIII, and Stray Bullet. With German industrial metal, I like Rammstein, Stahlmann, and Oomph!. My favorite Rammstein songs are Ich Will, Sonne, Feuer frei!, Du hast, Engel, Mein Teil, Mein Land, Mein Herz brennt, Amerika, Sehnsucht, Deutschland, Keine Lust, Zwitter, Ich tu dir weh, Radio, Du riechst so gut, Mutter, and Links 2 3 4. On that note, the lead singer has his own music under the name Lindemann (his last name), and I particularly like his song Skills in Pills. My favorite Stahlmann songs are Judas, Bastard, Military Lapdance, Nichts Spricht Wahre Liebe Frei, Angel der Dunkelheit, Leitwolf, W\u00e4chter, and Hass Mich...Lieb Mich. My favorite Oomph! songs are Labyrinth, Gott is ein Popstar, Ready Or Not, Augen auf!, Das Ietzte Streichholz, and Sex Is Not Enough. Sexschuss by HELDMASCHINE is a good song, too. If you're interested in post-hardcore rock, I recommend any song from Dance Gavin Dance, though I prefer Tilian's vocals to the vocals of old band members (and in relation, I recommend Tilian's solo songs, as well). Secret Band is also great, and Hollywood Undead. And I like Soil the Stillborn by Infant Annihilator, though it took me a long time to get into it. Some other bands are Hail the Sun, A Day to Remember, and I the Mighty. Paranoia is my favorite song by A Day to Remember, and my favorite song by Hail the Sun, too, ironically. Not sure what my favorite I the Mighty song is, but I like their whole Where The Mind Wants To Go \/ Where You Let It Go album. I recommend Sympathy by Too Close to Touch, and Strip The Soul by Porcupine Tree. Circa Survive is a good band, too, that blends various forms of rock together.\n  ","351482":"\n  My lover, spicy ramen, all the pleasant things from my childhood, Lil Xan, Big Time Rush, CiCi's, stuffed animals, good books, writing (and I love to analyze my characters), plants, birds, silk moths, Panda Express, anything my lover gives me\/makes for me, KitKats, Christmas music, Christmas and Halloween, when things go my way, when my lover is happy, roller skating. \ud83e\udd14\n  ","351483":"\n  Me playing this game: Time to enlarge the ugliest characters.\n  ","351484":"\n  I thought it looked nice when I took it.\n  ","351485":"\n  Well, a day for me is from 10 AM to about 1:45 AM.

But well, I think I do not know much about most things. There are some things I have invested a lot of research into, such as meth, which I've spent years reading about. A character in one of my stories was a meth addict, so I had to read about it. I suppose I care more about practical information that I actually need. I think my answer to his question explains what I want to know more about, but not what I actually know a lot about, so I will use this to mention those things. I know of many unusual fetishes and disorders, but I always want to learn even more. I know a lot about Lil Xan. I know many words, and I've read many yaoi manga. I know a decent amount about astrology, but I still need to read about the houses and the planets themselves. I know quite a bit about Thomas Jefferson and that time period in general. I know the meaning of various dreams. I've read a lot about schizophrenia, because I'm schizoaffective and want to understand my condition better. I know a lot about the Columbine massacre because I read about it very extensively last summer. I know the psychological reasoning behind paraphilias such as necrophilia. I know about several Catholic saints and know many religious terms, despite not being religious, because the book I'm translating is set in a Catholic school, and I also use these terms in my writing for metaphors. I know a lot about eating disorders and Munchausen Syndrome. At one point I was obsessed with reading about eye snow. I also know a lot about the history of cameras--camera obscura, collodion process, calotype, Brownie cameras, daguerreotype, etc. I know a whole list of people and their contributions to photography, but I still feel clueless about how to actually use a camera.

Neurology, because neurological conditions can mimic psychological ones, and it is important to make the distinction. Pedophilia, because it deserves more research. Birds and plants, because I love them. Little technological things, such as how a record player stylus reads the record (seriously, it touches the record and music plays, I am fascinated by things like that, because people do not give them much thought). Drugs, because how people respond to substances is interesting. The Middle Ages and the bubonic plague, overall an intriguing time to be alive, I want to read more about how they tried treating the plague and such. Julius Caesar, they kind of skim over him in school but he seems like an important figure to read more about. Native Americans, because they inhabited this land before us and created such beautiful things. I think they deserve much more respect and attention; their cultures are rather overlooked and their contributions and presence disregarded. Basically anything I reference in my writing, from weather terms to aspects of space, because I love the world and want to learn as much as possible about everything I can. I enjoy very obscure vocabulary and want to find the various definitions and meanings of a word. I want to learn more about STDs, mostly because I have OCD and reading about an STD helps me to shrug my obsessive thoughts aside and not think touching a marker after someone else has touched it will give me HIV. Using information to combat irrationality, that sort of thing. I want to learn more about criminals, because they all have a story to share.

Do not mistake your love becoming less passionate as you \"losing feelings.\" In the beginning love may be intense and passionate, but it becomes more subdued over time as you grow more comfortable. If your relationship is always intense, it is one build from infatuation rather than actual love. A peaceful relationship is not boring, it is normal.\n  ","351512":"\n  The common answer would be that it isn't harder to be connected to people, we are simply gaining a connection through different means. It is difficult to connect in real life--someone invites you to their table to eat with them, but they are on their phone and do not speak with you. The only bonding is over whatever is on their phone. But on the other hand, you can easily find friends online. Some may say online friendships are \"shallow,\" but that is dependent on the type of people you befriend, as I've personally had some meaningful friendships. Technology infringes upon us, but it also grants us greater opportunities.\n  \n  As for me specifically, I find most people and conversations boring, and I do not need friends. I also find it hard to relate to others, as they tend to be less open-minded about things.\n  ","351513":"\n  (In response to your questions)\n  \n  I'm not quite sure how to answer your first question, because I do not know much about the economy\/economic programs that are currently in effect. And I apologize but I know little about the economic situation in other countries right now, only the United States, so my answer will revolve around the conditions here. Regarding the coronavirus, I think the government has been foolish in their decisions, given that they provided money for individuals who are deceased, rather than giving those stimulus checks to people who are alive and struggling. If the virus were not so extended, they would not have to give out these checks (as I have heard they will give out a second round in the future?), considering we are already in enough debt and these checks further ruin the economy, not to mention the influx of unemployment precipitates those checks in the first place. In my opinion, there should have been more severe restrictions regarding people leaving their houses, visiting others, etc. Quarantine has been more \"recommended\" than required, not to mention our incompetent president has perpetrated the notion that the virus is a hoax and acts as if the leaders of all countries decided to conspire against him with a fake virus, being that he is a narcissist. His reassurance that the virus has been \"dealt with\" is the reason why people are not taking things seriously, and why the virus is spreading and people are losing their jobs. To summarize, the virus continuing to spread due to the government's negligence -> more jobs being lost, stimulus checks being required -> failing economy. I believe the biggest factors instigating poverty are our terrible health care system (without insurance, medical fees can be thousands of dollars, thus it is easy to go into debt and not be able to pay your bills) and the minimum wage being too low. You cannot live sustainably on $8 an hour, after all. Anyway, I hope this helped even a little. As I said, I do not have much knowledge of the situation.\n  ","351514":"\n  I disagree. There is a subjective truth and an objective truth. For instance, when I hallucinate a bug on my computer, it does not mean there is truly one on my computer. Because no one else can see this bug my senses created, it is not credible. If I hallucinate a smell, others will not be able to smell it and thus I cannot convince them it is there. There is no evidence, my senses just betray me.\n  ","351515":"\n  I like to write stories, whenever I feel inspired enough to do so. It's been an outlet for my own entertainment for years, and recently an outlet for my feelings, as well.

I want to convey the metaphors swirling in my head, and depict myself in the form of various characters.\n  ","351516":"\n  Assuming this love is genuine and is not backed by malicious intent, yes. I think people mistakenly believe hatred and a desire to \"correct\" others is somehow soothing and will heal a person, when on the contrary the primary factors in healing someone are love and understanding. Controlling and abusive love will not save you, and will instead exacerbate your state and instill trauma. But gentle love both saves and heals. I can attest to this.\n  ","351517":"\n  It's kind of a tie between We Happy Few and Silent Hill 2. I love the dystopian aspect of We Happy Few. The last couple of chapters of a story I wrote were greatly inspired by that game. As for Silent Hill 2, I love James' delusional state and how his guilt attacks him in the form of Pyramid Head. The game accurately portrays suicidality, in my opinion, not to mention the soundtrack is beautiful and the proper ambiance is created.\n  ","351518":"\n  I know that many people prefer socionics, but it's rather confusing. I think the type descriptions are accurate, however. But involving superego, ego, and id functions makes it hard to understand. I'd need to read more about it. Well, people do not bother to read about cognitive functions and thus believe they can switch between an extroverted and introverted type depending on how they feel that day. They just take the 16Personalities test and go with whatever result(s) they receive, even though that test is unreliable garbage. This is why you find so many INFPs who mistype themselves as INFJs, because they tend to be type Fours and hear that INFJs are the \"rarest type\" and want to be unique. And hm, I feel like the function definitions themselves aren't inconsistent, but the interpretations of them can be. It can be difficult to determine if a certain function is higher or lower than another.\n  ","351519":"\n  I admit I do not know much about socionics, though. ;; Me, too. I hate when someone is like \"I'm both an ENFJ and INFJ depending on my mood,\" as if your cognitive functions magically change, lmao. Or if they use their result from the terrible 16Personalities site. I thought I was a 1w9 INTJ for a long time, which makes sense considering they have the same functions as an ISFP, just in a different order.\n  ","351520":"\n  Korea, I quite like the clothes there. I do not have exact names of people who wore clothes I liked, but something like this is beautiful:\n  ","351521":"\n  I still get depressed, but not as often, and not as extremely. Well, there were several factors. I felt rejected by society, and experienced guilt for simply existing, which led to self-loathing. My lover helped me with this. But then someone online started harassing me, and spread various false rumors about me for no reason. I became very depressed and suicidal, to the point of wanting to cut off my limbs. And my lover was distressed, herself. I have a tendency to feel what she feels, so her being distressed made me distressed. I've been depressed since I was like 10, though, because I was emotionally neglected by my parents. And my environment hasn't exactly been stable. My parents fight all the time, and my father is an alcoholic. I became very paranoid that he was going to kill me. He's never hurt me, though. But I did witness him abuse my mother one time. Anyhow, the perpetual ostracism from society, as well as never-ending online harassment, is why I am depressed.\n  ","351522":"\n  There have been many. But maybe when I was hallucinating all the time. I hallucinated maggots in my food, corpses, walls shifting, walls closing in on me, objects falling, animals and people in the middle of the road, bugs crawling or flying in various places, someone's face in my room, and more. I also heard several male voices screaming at me, telling me to kill myself, and convincing me that everyone was out to get me. I had the delusion that zombies were real, that everyone was a robot and I was being experimented on, that I was being watched, that there was a man living in a wall in my closet, that everyone was conspiring against me, that maggots were building a kingdom in my body, that people were plotting to kill me... I became detached from reality. Yes, I started taking antipsychotics and now I rarely hallucinate\/have delusions, and I am no longer derealized\/depersonalized at all.

I'm not sure why, really. But I think two issues are the health care system and minimum wage. If you do not have health insurance, a 5 minute visit to the emergency room can cost around $5,000. Different types of medicine cost thousands of dollars a month without insurance. I saw a hospital bill a teacher received after giving labor, and it was over $100,000 without insurance. People go in debt because they cannot pay their medical bills, and if you cannot pay off your debt, you end up without a house, without your car, etc. If you have no transportation, you cannot go to work, so you end up jobless on top of homeless. And if you are getting paid $8 an hour, naturally you cannot pay your bills.\n  ","351525":"\n  Yeah, I have a lot of experience. I used to write three pages of text in notebooks back in the day. And I had small handwriting. Then I'd go online and type all of what I wrote. My teachers all said I was talented. I've had a couple of my poems published in a school magazine. It takes a long time to write a poem, though, so I don't enjoy it much. At least you've saved it!\n  ","351526":"\n  Here is just a portion from a rant I made on another site days ago:\n  \n  \"Because in reality 'sociopaths' are people who have not felt adequately loved, and thus cannot love others or sympathize with them. As I've said before, if you have never eaten a strawberry, how can you be expected to explain what it tastes like to someone else? If people do not sympathize with you, you cannot sympathize with them. That's where the problem lies, and the reason why 'sociopaths' deserve sympathy like anyone else. This denial of sympathy for them because they are 'terrible people' merely for existing only exacerbates their failure to sympathize with others. If you do not want someone doing immoral things, not caring for others, and overall being cruel, then accept, understand, and sympathize with them. Those things prevent criminality and the emotional ostracism from society.\"\n  \n  I wish people would understand that their constant rejection of a certain group of people inspires aggression.\n  \n  \"And I don't care about your statistic regarding minorities causing the most crime. Even if that's the case, do you care to think about why? I've said it before and I'll say it as many times as I have to, your oppression of minorities and mistreatment of them is the reason why they commit crimes and act out. If you beat an animal enough times, it's going to attack you. That's what society does, they are vicious to these people again and again, and so close-minded, that they commit crimes. Are you really that dense to not see that your actions have consequences, and that this statistic is the consequence of your behavior?\"\n  ","351527":"\n  On my phone, or?

Not to mention you haven't seemed to care about children being abused at home until just now, when it's convenient for you, in order to seem like a caring person on the surface. And if you've never been to public school or if you went as a child but it was a small school with about 100 students, then you have no right to interject on this subject given that there are schools with 2,000+ students and over 100 teachers, where hallways are cramped and people are pressed against each other. Everyone is shoving one another because there is no room. Not to mention there are bus shortages, in which there ends up being three students per a single seat. Based on these factors, the virus spreading is inevitable, and going to school for two days a week rather than five days is not going to help it, because the virus can spread tremendously in a single day. Janitors do not bother refilling the soap dispensers in bathrooms; moreover, they neglect to replace the paper towels, so you're left with only water to wash your hands with and nothing to dry them with (aside from toilet paper). And there are students who juul in bathroom stalls together. Also take into consideration the fact that not everyone bothers to wash their hands, and people would sneeze and cough on each other as a \"joke.\" You prioritize children not being abused over them not being killed or falling very ill, that says something about your character. AND school opening would not end the abuse, anyway. If teachers become sick and die, who is to teach the students? School is not a \"safe haven\" as long as bullying and school shootings exist, neither is home a safe place for many. But it truly is ironic how people only care NOW. If you are so concerned about abuse, investigate. And do not act as if guidance counselors are so helpful with everything. Many people have stated that they are useless, and when approached over someone being suicidal or getting harassed, they would just ask how their grades are and suggest that the reason for being depressed is not having an A in a certain class. That is how incompetent they can be. If you are so empathetic, take into consideration those who have their mental health ruined by going to school, rather than raving about children being abused at home, as if you've ever cared until this moment. Going there greatly triggers my OCD, while at home I'm just fine and not fraught with compulsions.\n  ","351529":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q1yx9qWjfdM\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","351530":"\n  I dislike how you have to look someone in the eyes when you speak to them.

I do not remember it well, but I have no significant complaints about that particular year. Though I think that was when a boy in school stalked me. I became more in touch with my devious nature in 2016, though I joked about it and did not take it too seriously. I had an eating disorder in either 2016 or 2017. In 2017 I lost the ability to sympathize with others. I was immensely distressed by my attraction, and this feeling of being rejected by society for who I was inspired an abundance of anger toward the world that became suppressed sadism. I was very emotionally unstable, paranoid, and depressed, and I experienced hallucinations and delusions, but on the surface I was logical and stable. I did not let my instability affect my interest in helping others with psychological problems. I was much too open and honest. I became a porn addict, and no form of porn was extreme enough. I met my lover near the end of that year. We were both unstable. I started taking medicine for hallucinations\/delusions. She accepted me for who I was, and it was through her that I could sympathize with others again. My sadism was alleviated. I became a much gentler person who loved birds and little things in life. But 2018 was the peak of me being suicidal, as I started being severely harassed online, which landed me in a mental hospital. I do not remember 2019 very well. I was still self harming then, but I was gradually becoming more stable, and so was my lover, to a degree. I still experience depressive and manic episodes, despite mood stabilizing medicine, but I no longer self harm, and I rarely have hallucinations\/paranoid delusions. I accept myself, just as I accept others. I remain open and honest, though I am more reluctant to give out certain information, as I am still being harassed\/stalked. I would say I am more peaceful as a person. In 2017 I was interested in committing a heinous crime, but I have no such interest anymore. The past few years have been traumatizing for me, but I think I have definitely changed for the better. I feel more in touch with the world around me. In 2017, I was also depersonalized\/derealized. I currently love nature, and I consider myself to be a very understanding and empathetic person. Unfortunately people do not take the time to get to know the current me, so they still see me as that immoral person I was in 2017. Some people just never move on from the past. It is sad when someone who never changes projects that stagnant inability to change on you, as well. I remain mentally ill, and maintain certain stances that are perhaps \"morally incorrect,\" but I am a much more caring and lawful person than I was.\n  ","351533":"\n  Well, assuming pause means stopping time, I would like to stop time in order to be able to do things I enjoy, because it is annoying for there to be only 24 hours in a day, and for 8+ of them to be spent sleeping. I wish I could pause time when my lover visits, too. The time passes too quickly. I'd rather not rewind because there were too many unpleasant moments in the past. There were good ones, too, of course.\n  ","351534":"\n  Well, they do not disturb. They are not particularly loud creatures, more reserved, from what I've observed. I think it is the fact that they are so overlooked, rather than an animal that many people obsess over. There was a sense of purity about them, to see them standing in a green and murky body of water, all white or somewhat gray. Something that is present and prominent but disregarded. And they are not malicious. In fact, they fly away if you approach them, similar to other birds. I think this retreating nature is something innocent.\n  ","351535":"\n  I love going to South Carolina and visiting the beach. The food there is also amazing, and I highly recommend eating at Pizzeria Di Giovanni. Here we have geese and they are lame, but there they have herons!

I cherish all the bracelets she made, but I wear this one most often.\n  ","351537":"\n  Teachers measure it, and with grades. But the system is flawed in that there are various types of intelligence, and grades only measure the ability to memorize information and regurgitate it. Those with a bad memory or with a tendency to second guess themselves perform poorly in school and get called unintelligent for it. But they should know that it is not their fault. School does not measure the different types of intelligence, merely memorization. It is thus not \"education.\"\n  ","351538":"\n  Here is my personal view on religion as a concept, though I respect those who are religious. I posted this on another site.\n  \n  \"With religion, you are seeing everything from someone else's eyes. Rather than \"Am I doing the right thing (in my opinion)?\", it is \"Am I doing the right thing (according to my god's opinion)?\" It is all about how someone else sees you, rather than how you see yourself. It takes \"caring what people think\" to a completely different level, because everything you do revolves around your god and pleasing them. Why not please yourself? Why not do what you want, instead of what you are expected to do? This is why I think any growth is limited, and your views depend on what is sinful versus not sinful. This automatically leads to being close-minded, because anything you perceive as \"bad\" must be \"corrected\" and \"forgiven,\" rather than just accepting that \"bad\" things are natural and thus not sinful. I feel like you aren't moving on in life if you're constantly asking someone for forgiveness with every little bad thing you do. You fail to recognize that things just happen, and things simply are. Instead it's this perfectionist thing where you have to be pure and worthy of going to heaven. Separating the world between pure and impure is already an issue itself.\n  \n  In other words, I think being religious inevitably leads you to be dependent on others and what they'd think of you. You rely on someone else's moral code rather than developing your own morals, thoughts, and beliefs. You aren't living your own life but rather the life someone else wants you to lead. And that, I think, is what is so restrictive about religion, and this sort of thing is what breeds ignorance and shaming others for how they are rather than just accepting nature. It's like condemning a murderer because they've committed a \"sin\" rather than trying to understand what led to it, what their psychological state was, and other things that are based on their environment. You are not focusing on individuals themselves, only their actions and the morality of those actions.\"\n  \n  Moreover, there is this statement that if you are living without being religious, that is \"delusional.\" But keep in mind that all animals aside from humans live without religion, and they are just fine. Religion is a man made concept.\n  \n  \"I don't think it's delusional to live without religion, I think it shows you do not rely on someone else's guidance in life, and to me that represents your own personal strength. Religion assumes you are submissive to someone else and need them to show you the way. With no religion, you are in control of your own life, morality, feelings, thoughts, beliefs, behavior, and so on.\"\n  \n  So, that is why I am not religious, though as stated, I am fine with others being such, because we all have different views on things. I just find it restrictive for the aforementioned reasons.\n  ","351539":"\n  Hmmm.

However, rather than being a positive, this defensive response drives inflammation in the body that can be toxic. Research returned from Eisenberger\u2019s analysis of social isolation via the study of online gaming uncovers how the brain reacts when people are excluded from a game of catch. The results? Those who reacted negatively to the rejection returned brain scans showing neural activity linked to physical pain. These findings emphasize how emotions are more than just surface reactions and are key to a deeper understanding of the human condition and, thus, should be taken just as seriously as physical pain and sickness.\"\n  ","351541":"\n  A solid 3, the problems with the site are quite annoying.

I scoured many websites to find a working download, and even downloaded strange programs (in Japanese, which I could not read) to try to help me. It took hours and hours, and downloading the second game took a whole day, I think? Anyway, I did not give up, so now I have both the first and second games in English. It also took me a long time to download Rewrite (a visual novel). I am far too determined to give up, haha. And actually I lost several chapters of an old story of mine, but I retrieved a file of them, yet when transferred to a document there were many unnecessary things, like <<<< and such, everywhere. It took a long time to format the documents properly, but I managed. Though I lost entire stories of mine and cannot get them back. :\/\n  ","351544":"\n  It is such a shame that she went missing.

I am the type of person whose performance in school and such is not affected by any mental instability, for I prioritize work over my emotions and can set them aside no matter how distressed I feel. But my ability to make friends and talk to anyone has certainly been impacted. I am not someone who needs friends, but any chance of making one gets destroyed because I cannot get close to anyone in the slightest; I feel too traumatized.

I was paranoid and had delusions of persecution, as well as delusions that zombies were real. I constantly wore wrist braces from injuring my wrists after typing too much. Gym clothes always made me feel self-conscious about my body, and teachers did not understand I had ankle problems and could not run. I spent years not knowing how to tie my shoes and had to ask random people for help. When I was very young I had trouble reading and had to take a special class for it, but as I grew older I read many books, which annoyed my 5th grade teacher given that I read books rather than going outside during recess. In middle school I got a concussion and was sensitive to lights\/sounds, which teachers did not care about, so my head hurt all the time. I became \"friends\" with an anorexic girl who was mean to me, and I haven't been able to shake her off since. Teachers have not understood that I need to be listening to music at all times because my ears ring permanently, I become distracted without it, and I also hallucinate without it. Not to mention years of being suicidal, self harming, and at one point going to a mental hospital. And being stalked by a boy who had a crush on me, having my seat at lunch stolen by a different boy who had a crush on me, and being stared at by other boys who had crushes on me. So obnoxious. My friends ostracized me in 6th grade for liking yaoi lmao. Then years later they were like \"I accept homosexuality!!!\" Such hypocrites. I also had a porn addiction for a while and fantasized during school. And had homicidal thoughts because my head hurt and everyone irritated me. I'm good now though.\n  ","351558":"\n  Oh yeah, the difficult thing is going back and trying to translate what I was expressing because even I forget what I was trying to say and then I have to guess. I do it after I finish each chapter, but seeing as how it takes me forever to finish a chapter, I forget much of what I was saying. I'm trying to do it as I go along now. The first chapters are nothing compared to the recent ones, I'm using more advanced terminology and metaphors. Here is just a random paragraph I've written:\n  \n  \"Niveous days swept across the windshield of a peripatetic vehicle. Sho\u2019s former conduct susurrated in shades of braille. Those derailed headlights still flashed in my dreams. Exhaust pilfered me at the site of debitage. The airbag was a mere monosyllabic god in the firmament, yet a phyllid blood clot atrophied any sense of impending danger from panorama. I caracoled atop misery\u2019s cleft palate. His morality, once trabeate, hiccupped itself into a sanitation bin, arcuate under the pressure of various sinful syringes. It was contaminated; I was stabbed by his diseased verity, unable to prevaricate in the decadent face of the death penalty. How I dreaded the redient opportunity of radiant malversation in the office of Sho\u2019s tendencies. Nonetheless, my solicitude was but a soliloquy; the feculent thought meeting was adjourned, yet a coruscation of qualm could not be bailed out of prison.\"\n  \n  And here's another random excerpt:\n  \n  \"While my thoughts caprioled, I loitered down the stairs, body furnishing maintenance issues. I recognized this permutation of an occurrence--descend, then discover something askew and panic. However, the allele of unearthing was altered each time, jousting me in an altercation of virtues. The perilymph within the cochlea of my incorporeal soul issued a treaty between the floorboards as my frame articulated itself in vain. At times my emotional homeostasis was unamenable, placidity and disconsolation molding in tubal ligation.\"\n  ","351559":"\n  I'm not sure exactly how \"realistic\" you'd consider them to be because in my head the characters look like anime guys lmao. They're all based off of me though. But the setting is kind of a European-like Japan.

I will not answer any questions that sexually objectify me, meaning nothing about masturbation habits, nudes, breast size, etc. I am also not revealing very personal information like the town I live in, my full name, what my house looks like, and so forth. Ask also does not seem to like swear words and the terms of use can be rather limiting when it comes to controversial opinions, suicidal thoughts, gore, \"disturbing\" videos, etc. You are forced to censor yourself. So if you would like to talk in private or ask things that would otherwise be censored on here, add me on Discord. \ud83d\udc4c\n  ","351561":"\n  I have done a good deed.\n  ","351562":"\n  The death penalty is unconstitutional and I am not sure why it is not banned in every state. Killing someone who has killed someone else or committed a similarly extreme crime makes you no better than them. It is an eye for an eye, and that is not right. Moreover, it does not allow for personal growth and repentance. But the prison system here is corrupt in the first place in that it emphasizes punishment rather than rehabilitation. This is why the prison system in Norway is the best, they treat their prisoners as actual people rather than animals. If you mistreat an already harmful animal, they will only become more ferocious. You need to help them.\n  ","351563":"\n  Because life is sad.\n  ","351564":"\n  I made this statement on another site. Not directed at anyone in particular but people in general.\n  \n  \"So, the thing about small talk is. If you are older than elementary school aged, or perhaps even older than you were in 2nd grade, you are capable of forming complex sentences. Therefore this constant reversion to simple sentences that a child could create, \"How are you?\" and \"Hi,\" is elementary. You are an adult and can create meaningful\/long phrases, yet instead you choose to act like you have no understanding of the English language. And that is what is so pathetic about it, as well as the assumption that others are as shallow as you and so superficial to stoop to an elementary level, themselves. It does not make me boring for not wanting to respond to your ridiculously mundane question with \"Okay,\" it means I am mature enough to want proper and EFFECTIVE communication that does not resemble a child's. I do not care what is \"convenient\" or \"comfortable\" for you, you act like a child and I do not want to participate, simply.\n  \n  And for reference, \"favorite\" questions are also elementary given that when you just begin learning French, they teach you to say things like \"My favorite show is ___\" or \"I prefer ___ over ___.\" French teachers repeatedly remind you that this understanding of the language is extremely minimal and likened to someone who is 4 or something. Therefore the argument can be made that you repeatedly asking someone what their favorite movie is and them replying \"My favorite movie is blah blah\" is comparable to this meager French comprehension.\n  \n  If you would like to be treated as an adult then use more detailed sentences and stop using lowercase. It isn't cute, it isn't interesting, it's lazy and proves you have the mentality and intelligence of a child. How can you act as if you are so superior when you have evidently not learned to capitalize letters?\"\n  ","351565":"\n  Assuming I am understanding your question correctly.... No, there are difficulties even with love, such as how you may love someone who does not reciprocate it. Then your feelings are being held back. While love may be liberating for some, it can be restricting for those in an abusive\/controlling relationship. Love is like a bird, but if it cannot find a nest, what is it to do? You are free to love, but those feelings may not go anywhere, in other words, and there may not be any application.\n  ","351566":"\n  I'm not sure about common necessarily, but here are a list of misconceptions nonetheless, common or not.\n  \n  No, you do not PMS during your period. PMS stands for premenstrual syndrome, meaning BEFORE your period, so please men, stop using the argument that a woman must be \"on her period\" just because you made her angry.\n  \n  It does not take 7 years for cells to be replaced. Cells die and are regenerated at different rates, some taking a couple weeks, others taking longer. This means that you do not have to wait 7 years for the touch of your rapist to be gone.\n  \n  And god this makes me so angry. No, pedophiles are not attracted to teenagers, ephebophiles and hebephiles are. Pedophilia is an attraction to prepubescent children, meaning they haven't started puberty yet (often ages 11 and below or so). Also, being attracted to someone does not mean you have offended, so you are not automatically a sex offender. As well, no one chooses their attraction, especially one that they would be condemned for. Homosexuality isn't the only thing you do not choose, stop cherry picking where to apply logic and where not to apply it. Also, not every minor attracted person was sexually abused as a child, that is yet another misconception.\n  \n  Just because women have the right to vote does not mean sexism has vanished.\n  \n  Just because segregation has ended does not mean racism has vanished.\n  \n  Being mentally ill is not the same as being disabled.\n  \n  OCD is not being a neat person.\n  \n  You are most likely not \"hearing voices\" but rather your internal voice. Auditory hallucinations are different from your internal voice.\n  \n  Depression is not feeling sad sometimes.\n  \n  Psychotic is not a synonym for crazy. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder. Psychosis = delusions and hallucinations.\n  \n  Zodiac signs and horoscopes are not the same thing.\n  \n  No, stomach fat does not exist to protect your uterus. Your uterus is not where your stomach is. Please learn basic female anatomy before making this statement.\n  \n  Not everyone drinks\/does drugs.\n  \n  Weed is not a saintly drug without negative side effects. There is such thing as weed induced psychosis, for instance.\n  \n  Not everyone has a hymen.\n  ","351567":"\n  Perhaps not directly, but I believe people may unintentionally live up to the stereotypes behind their name (whether good or bad). The name may affect certain aspects, such as how if there are two girls by the name of Abby in a class, the teacher has to call one Abby E. versus Abby F. and such depending on the last name. I imagine that gets annoying. My name is rare where I live, so I can never find it on a keychain, heh. That is annoying, as well. Apparently someone's name can influence how you perceive them, too.\n  ","351568":"\n  No, he was planning on kidnapping someone, but I think he was too much of a coward to actually do it, hence why I did not take him seriously. He was going on about kidnapping  a girl and having her develop Stockholm Syndrome for him. It was very strange. He played games all day and dropped out of college. He was very controlling toward me and took advantage of my kindness. I still have trauma from it even though we only talked for a month.\n  ","351569":"\n  No, I think he wanted help with getting away with the crime. I just thought he was being an idiot. I'm not sure if he ever went through with anything or not but I assume otherwise considering he messaged me yet again about a year later and I essentially told him to leave me alone. He contacted me because I would not judge him, most likely. But I severely doubted him.\n  ","351570":"\n  Yeah, they're pretty trashy at teaching about presidents in school. The main complaints about Nixon were his reluctance to withdraw soldiers from Vietnam during the Vietnam War, his bad economic decisions, hiding information from the public, and taking certain actions without the consent of Congress. But I feel as if he had a good character regardless, after reading quotes from him, reading articles about him, and watching a couple interviews of him. He did not have bad intentions and genuinely cared about the public. He also set the precedent for establishing peaceful connections with other countries, which I find important. He seemed to be in favor of feminism and ending segregation. He did not enjoy conflict and, despite being in denial of his actions for a while, eventually admitted to his wrongdoings and expressed remorse. In other words, he was able to set his ego aside, which corrupt people like Trump are unable to do. I feel like Nixon has had a bad reputation due to his actions but his character is often overlooked. In my opinion, someone's character is their most important feature.\n  ","351571":"\n  Twitter troubles me, I like posts on various subjects, from birds to murderers, and people follow me expecting one thing but unfortunately get another as well... I wish no one followed me because I feel guilty. This is why my therapist says I am too people pleasing.\n  ","351572":"\n  They seem rather interchangeable. Money is power, power is money. Someone who is powerful is often perceived as being dominant\/intimidating, but it is the powerful people who tend to have money. Money can silence the masses. A person can only do so much, but money controls the world. While we are not all influenced by a single powerful person, we are all influenced by money.\n  ","351573":"\n  I dislike how people throw the word \"phobia\" around casually. A phobia is something that harms your quality of life. It is not something like \"Oh, I'm afraid of spiders.\" A phobia is actively avoiding something, constantly thinking about it, etc. I have experienced extreme entomophobia (a fear of bugs) to the extent where I've been afraid to leave my house because there are bugs everywhere outside. I hallucinate bugs when I am not on medicine, seeing maggots in my cereal. I also have mysophobia stemming from my OCD. I see counters and such as being infected with germs. I fear touching something after someone else has touched it. I have obsessive thoughts that sitting on a toilet will give me a disease, and struggle to touch doorknobs with my bare hands. I fear that everything has microscopic blood on it.\n  \n  As for fears, rather than phobias. I am afraid of needles, as well as fire, and I have a bit of a fear of heights. And I am afraid of underwater animatronics.\n  ","351574":"\n  Eraser - Reduction (Coil remix) by Nine Inch Nails, Pilots by Goldfrapp, all songs by The Make Believes, all songs from the latest Dance Gavin Dance album, Bloody Valentine by MGK, Only Time by Enya, Sola Sistim by Underworld (and the entire A Hundred Days Off album), all songs by Heffron Drive, the whole Heartbreak Soldiers pt. 2 mixtape by Lil Xan, basically anything by MSI, and anything by Lemon Demon.

ISFJs are more people pleasing than ISFPs. I mistook myself for an INTJ for a long time--they have the same functions as an ISFP, but in a different order. I did not recognize the fact that my Fi and Se were so high. ;; I've always been so focused on expressing myself and being authentic.\n  ","351576":"\n  It isn't possible. Please read about cognitive functions to solidify your type. You never switch types or can be more than one type. One major difference between ISFPs and ISFJs is that ISFPs have dominant Fi, meaning all decisions are based around their personal values\/morals, and they do not wish to conform with society. They greatly care about self-expression and individualism. One example of an ISFP is Prince. ISFJs have Fe, meaning they value social values more than personal values and their morals are aligned with commonly accepted morals. They prioritize the values\/feelings of others over their own values\/feelings. ISFJs are also more traditional due to dominant Si, and emphasize the past, whereas ISFPs have Se and thus focus on the present and being spontaneous. Which sounds more like you?\n  ","351577":"\n  Yeah, the majority of tax dollars go to the military. The military here has more money than all the 7 other countries with the highest amount of money spent on their military. A lot of it also goes to social security. Whereas the least amount of tax dollars go toward things such as space exploration, which I feel is important. But people here are delusional and think socialism is a bad thing and we should not become like European countries with free healthcare, because \"taxes will go up.\" If the government cut military spending then maybe they could actually pay off the national debt. Hospital bills can be over $100,000, and medicine can cost thousands, too, but we do not get paid enough to deal with those expenses. They act like everyone is rich. And we already have \"socialist\" things in our society, such as public libraries, the post office, public schools, etc. Socialism is not dangerous like people think it is. Capitalism leeches off of everyone.\n  ","351578":"\n  I just find it inhumane, someone may need medicine every month to survive a certain condition, but without insurance it can be thousands of dollars. It is either die or go into debt, essentially, because here it is all about money. The government cares little about our well-beings, hence why cigarettes are legal despite causing lung cancer; it's all about profiting off of tobacco. People get paid $7 an hour and cannot feed their children. Millionaires and billionaires hoard all the money. I have no job or money, though I've heard that if you put $200 in your savings account every month, you can eventually become a millionaire. I wonder if it's true, though.\n  ","351579":"\n  I was forced to mature from an early age due to an early puberty and my brother needing to be taken care of. I get mistaken for being older than I am. Not in real life, though. I look young. I'm a very childish person in the sense that I enjoy bringing back pleasurable things from my childhood. I collect many stuffed animals, toys children would like, etc. I play games I liked as a child and watch shows I liked back then.

It is just a personality thing.\n  ","351580":"\n  \\o\/\n  ","351581":"\n  I wrote a story about two boys who lived in an asylum, but it became about one of those boys and a drug addict, and it was a 47 (?) chapter long mess no one has read in its entirety aside from me rereading it because it's lowkey addicting. There was quite a bit of murder, and themes of necrophilia, suicidality, pedophilia, and other interesting things. I started writing a story about a boy who is in love with his mother, but it was just a chapter long as I kind of gave up on it. My current story is about a serial killer pedophile and his stalker coworker who is in love with him and wants to eat people. I've written 9 chapters so far, and I'll be finished with the 10th soon. I also write some love poems every now and then. Oh, and I also wrote prequels to the asylum one, one of which got deleted because it was on a writing site that was taken down without notice. I lost all the stories I wrote when I was 8 or 9. My stories are very gay (guy x guy) because I struggle to write female characters.\n  ","351582":"\n  I do not believe in an afterlife. I do believe in reincarnation, however. It's more like, you die and then your soul finds itself in someone else's body. What matters is that I hold myself accountable for things. I care not about intangible things like an afterlife. I am the one to monitor my own mistakes and good deeds. I see what you are saying, but even if there potentially was a god, it does not concern me. It would make no difference to my life if there were one.\n  ","351583":"\n  Well, I was very suicidal before she came along, and still suicidal after, but I do not kill myself because I love her and want to be with her.

As I stated, I do not care for existential questions.\n  ","351584":"\n  My parents created me. I have no interest in things like how the world was created, or the meaning of the universe. I like practical things, and things that are proven. Something I can see with my own eyes. My lover did not create me, certainly, but she is why I exist, my reason for living. I do not dwell on existentialism, I'm more down-to-earth. I do not rely on some higher power for peace and happiness, though I have no problem with those who do. Some people use religion to answer life's basic questions. Why am I here? Who created me? How should I live? Who am I? But I do not care to find an answer. I know who I am, from my own self observation, and I am here because my lover wants me here. Anything else I find irrelevant. I care about living in the moment, rather than thinking about the past or future. It is okay to be religious, and to care about your god(s), and your purpose, and the afterlife, if you believe in such. I am satisfied without religion, however.\n  ","351585":"\n  Oh, I see. Well, I see my lover as a goddess, and everything I do, I do for her. \ud83d\ude0c But not in a legitimate worshipful way. I exist for her. She brings me peace, happiness, and universal understanding. I understand myself through her, and can accept myself through her. I do not pray or do anything special. I guess I am spiritual?

Sometimes I forget clouds exist and then when I notice them I am absolutely amazed.\n  ","351587":"\n  Of course, it's not like I'm happy all the time, not even close, I'm so emotionally unstable it's not even funny. I have several mental illnesses and get harassed by people on a daily basis. But I still try to be optimistic and not worry about things. I discovered that peace is found on the outside rather than the inside. Indeed, everyone has their own destination.\n  ","351588":"\n  Imagine being someone who is close with family members, can't relate. True, why else would you have a table if not to eat food there? I never eat in my room. Um, yeah, I'd think there's a major problem with that. ;; One time in 8th grade or so I was coughing so badly that I had to go to a water fountain and cried there. You know when you're coughing and tears come? That kind of thing. Well, sometimes the sky makes sounds that do not resemble thunder, they are more like strange noises, and I couldn't explain it. That's not even the worst of it though.\n  ","351589":"\n  Something I wrote a few days ago. I modified it.\n  \n  \"You decide what is moral or not, and to begin with, any attraction is moral because no attraction is chosen, all attractions are nature-based, and what is natural is moral by default. Otherwise you begin to argue that a cat killing a mouse is immoral because murder is immoral. But it's natural for a cat to kill a mouse, because it needs to do that to survive. Any urge you have is moral, because any urge is natural. We shouldn't ascribe morality to emotions. The feeling of arousal cannot be immoral because arousal is natural. Natural = moral. Morality can be ascribed to actions, however. But we as humans also choose which actions are moral or not. In other words, you are not corrupt for any feeling or urge you possess, but some would argue that your actions are corrupt. But what is \"corrupt\"? Something harmful. Therefore if you are not inflicting harm, there is no \"immorality\" to your feelings or urges. Morality only concerns actions. And what is truly immoral? Denying yourself emotional expression, denying yourself the ability to act upon that urge. Restriction, painful and torturous. So then, again, what is immoral? Corrupt actions, as well as the suppression of one's urges and feelings. But then, you see, the more you suppress them, the more likely you are to explode and to act upon those urges\/feelings. Both suppression and actions are detrimental. Such is law, both suppressing and provoking various urges. Nature does not care for this so called social morality, this \"your actions are corrupt\" mentality. Nature goes, here is how you feel, now free those feelings to be at peace. Immorality is suppressing nature. It's an interference with what has been determined of you. Understandable criticism = your actions are immoral. Extreme, unnecessary, unnatural criticism = your feelings are immoral. Feelings are moral, actions are either moral or not, immoral meaning corrupt, but what is most immoral is the denial of the self and the suppression of your feelings, leading to self sabotage, depression, etc.\"\n  \n  No feeling, no urge, is more \"disgusting\" than another, nor more \"corrupt.\" I do not support corrupt actions, but I will support all feelings, no matter their nature. It is only if the feeling becomes an urge and the urge becomes a (harmful) action that there is a problem, or if the feeling is distressing to oneself. You are a man attracted to another man? There is no shame in it, for feelings are feelings. And this mindset is NOT limited to the \"accepted\" feelings that are not chosen, but all feelings that are not chosen. Not just homosexuality but far more socially unacceptable desires. I accept all and criticize none. Only those who choose to accept this desire over that one. All desires are humane, but all actions are not. Yet I am understanding of actions, as well.\n  ","351590":"\n  It sucks, it feels too awkward, I have nothing to say to anyone. I know people who eat in separate rooms, while watching TV, etc. I just eat as quickly as possible and then run upstairs. ;; It takes me forever to bring trash downstairs, I couldn't imagine eating in my room. Yes, and I hate when you cough in class and everyone has to hear it. I always have like two bags of cough drops on me at all times, though. They do not allow cough drops in school but would you rather hear me cough or??? So foolish. At least the sky tried. Being sick is not cute though! But you know what is cute, I always called it the \"sky making sounds\" because I did not understand the sounds were from thunder. It took me until like last summer to realize, I am quite dumb. My girlfriend still laughs at me over it. (\u2022_\u2022)\n  ","351591":"\n  For me, happiness is more about feeling peaceful, but other times I become quite excitable and manic, and that is pleasant, as well. Happiness is accepting things as they are, and seeing beauty in simple things that people often overlook. It can be difficult to stop resisting outside forces and accept that sometimes nothing can be done about a situation, but it is necessary for peace of mind, and peace of mind is peace of existence. It feels as if people seek happiness in the intangible more often than the tangible. Things like birds and plants make me happy, I think they are quite underrated. People emphasize friendships and relationships all too much, when nature is one of the greatest sources of happiness. And that's coming from someone who never goes outside, hah.\n  ","351592":"\n  Because here we all eat at the table, and no one speaks a word, because there is nothing to say. Ohhhh, I see. Here it rains often during the summer. It rained today, in fact. Yes, I get sick maybe twice a year for about a week each time. Though it's just a cough\/sneezing, no vomiting. I think the last time I threw up was years ago. Surgery for what? What is cute. ;;\n  ","351593":"\n  That's not so bad, I get sick for maybe 14 days or so, I'd have to count. I never exercise so I try not to eat too much so I won't gain weight. I used to have an eating disorder and starved myself. :\/ Now I just have tendencies. Smh, you are exaggerating, you are not fat. You have me, though. \ud83d\ude0e Same, I never leave my room or house. My parents always complain that I only go downstairs to eat.\n  ","351594":"\n  Wisdom is about acceptance and understanding. The stupid are ignorant and not accepting or understanding. You can either evolve or devolve in your belief system. You choose to become either close-minded or open-minded. Beliefs are deeply ingrained, whether attributed to nature or nurture, and can be difficult to stray from after a certain point in life. The wise ones know themselves well, and know others well as a result, while the stupid ones know nothing but existential malapropism, too far gone in hypocrisy and mistakes to care. Their false convictions will not falter, nor will the proper convictions of wisdom falter. It depends on what one considers \"wise.\" One is not wise for being old. In fact, the elderly often uphold conservative beliefs and refuse to adapt to changing times, not accepting what is \"new.\" Wisdom is accepting change, accepting others, accepting oneself, understanding all, and if not understanding something, expressing this and attempting to understand. Stupidity is accepting nothing but one's own delusions, and rejecting what is not understood. Both parties may change, but it is harder to become open-minded than it is to become close-minded, thus the stupid and ignorant are ultimately unchanging in the face of wisdom.\n  ","351595":"\n  Wrote this a couple days ago on another site.\n  \n  \"The mistake (self-loathing) people make is that they immediately go to self love techniques. They try to appreciate themselves better. And they fail, and wonder why they still hate themselves. Why? Because you're still gossiping about other people and spreading your hatred for them. You're still close-minded and mean. And why love a mean person? It's easier to love and accept someone who is loving and accepting. Your journey to happiness and not being self-loathing anymore begins with accepting, understanding, and loving others. And as a result, you will accept, understand, and love yourself. What goes out comes in, not what goes in comes out. Surroundings -> your own sense of self worth.\"\n  \n  The hypocrisy people spat is so astounding. They cherry pick what to accept and what not to accept. I accept all feelings. I do not consider any feelings to be \"disgusting\" or \"disturbing,\" as no one chooses how to feel, and there is no sense in blaming what is unchosen. Judge reasonably, for what can be changed, but not how someone is by nature. Actions and behavior can be altered and prevented, but feelings are guiltless, and only some can be changed. Accept those that cannot. The cycle of relentless ignorance and not accepting what you do not understand will not lead to happiness and peace in your life.\n  \n  \"Peace with others = peace with yourself\n  \n  The solution for your depression is acceptance. That's the whole Buddhist philosophy, peace with nature leads to peace with yourself. You need a sociological imagination. To put yourself in someone else's shoes. And it doesn't mean peace with nature itself but peace with others, too. Nature meaning the world around you, and the world around you includes other people. If you don't understand something, use it as an opportunity to learn and grow. If you don't accept what you don't understand, then how will you gain any knowledge and insight? It's like, I don't understand this math problem, so I won't do it. Then how do you come to understand it? How do you progress in your math skills? Apply this to every aspect of life. People are selectively close-minded. Open your mind to everything.\"\n  \n  And I mean absolutely everything, not only that which makes you comfortable. If something brings you unease, that is an opportunity to learn more about it, rather than shut yourself off. There is no growth in ignorance and stagnation.\n  ","351596":"\n  Rather than a single event, I wish I could undo the years of self-loathing I've endured as a result of feeling ostracized and hated by society. Consequently, I wish I could undo the various attempts at my life and strangling myself out of desperation. What I regret is not the things I said in the past, nor any action, but how I've treated myself. I have done nothing to deserve the mistreatment of others, nor the mistreatment of myself toward myself. I regret the suppression of anger that was thus turned inward. I would like to undo driving my lover unstable due to my own instability, and having her deal with me during catatonic and psychotic episodes. I cry when I reflect on what I've done to myself.\n  ","351597":"\n  This whole thing about not trusting ANYONE is so edgy, I have a great instinct and know who to trust\/who not to trust, a black and white mindset is so foolish. I can know practically everything about someone based on very little information, my intuition is much too good. People are very predictable and their intentions can be read from far away. If you do not have the natural ability to sense whether you can trust someone or not, you should improve upon your observation skills. Luckily that sort of thing is easy for me because I have always been an observer. I have been betrayed in the past, as well as abandoned, but I predicted it each time, precisely because I am able to see through everyone. Not everyone is out to get you, I promise, and persecution complexes are ugly.\n  ","351598":"\n  The people should overthrow the government. :\/ But I guess that's only an American concept, really. Still, it's the people versus the government at that point. That's true, but it's a matter of being safe where you live. I don't remember all the names of them, but I've listened to many of their songs. A friend of mine showed me the music video for Animal I Have Become in 4th grade and I was like \"This is so edgy.\"\n  \n  And goodnight! Don't get robbed while I'm away. ;;\n  ","351599":"\n  Oh no, my browser history is a mess, though I'm not ashamed of anything recent, so maybe that's fine. The last 20 pics involve pics of me, so I'd rather delete all pics of me before making those images public, I just take pics of my cats otherwise. If I can't remove pictures of me before the 20 go public then my search history is better. I think I cleared it not that long ago, anyway.\n  ","351600":"\n  I've only had one lover. I've been with her for two and a half years. I've never been interested in relationships. I am not attracted to people my age whatsoever, and hardly attracted to anyone older. I thought I was incapable of loving someone or being in a relationship, because I was so unfeeling at the time. I thought no one would accept me for who I was. Luckily she accepts me, and even understands me better than I understand myself.\n  ","351601":"\n  I do. My best friend from 3rd-5th grade understood me well, but I moved before 5th grade and we hardly talked that year, then I lost contact with them completely, aside from one occasion. My friends from middle school were great, I miss them, too, we ended up going to different high schools. I never made any friends in high school, but I feel friendship is unnecessary. I do not crave friends. I stopped talking to all of my online friends. They disappointed me when I needed them most. Some of them did not, however, but I struggle to maintain consistent contact with anyone because everyone bores me and I have this inclination to leave conversations immediately after they begin. It's difficult to trust them after what I've been put through, even though some of them are genuinely nice people. But as I said, I do not require friends, anyway. I do not experience loneliness very often.\n  ","351602":"\n  Not really. If I write a memoir about my life, that is factual information. Facts do not all have to be little pieces of information, they can be a series of information that is verifiable and lacks discrepancies. What you are referring to are things without bias. Like how spiders have eight legs. That is factual information that cannot be refuted, and there is no bias involved. So sure, if you'd like to find unbiased information, read such reference books, but otherwise information comes with bias as it can be told from various points of views and people with varying intentions, emotions, beliefs, etc.\n  ","351603":"\n  So many things, I don't know where to start. Well. When I was 13, I was open about my age online, because I wanted to be as open as possible about everything. People praised me for it. I ended up hiding my age as a result of repeated sexual harassment by men, as well as ageism I faced on a daily basis. I never lied about my age, however, I just wanted to hide it, but then idiots spread rumors about me lying without any evidence to prove it. It has been years since then, yet some people still think I am thirteen or fifteen, even though I stopped talking about my age after thirteen. I discovered my unusual sexual attraction when I was thirteen and was in denial about it for a year. I went into a state of distress when I finally accepted it, and this guilt for who I was triggered auditory hallucinations, as well as worsening the visual hallucinations I had developed months prior. An important friend abandoned me on Christmas Eve of 2016. As a form of coping, I became emotionless, though not intentionally. I began to struggle with manic and depressive episodes. I acted very logical on the surface, and stopped feeling sympathy for anything. If you feel no one cares about you, you can't care about others in return. But I was quite unstable and emotional behind closed doors. This emotionless appearance was a facade, not created to lie but created as a defense mechanism during a state where I was vulnerable. I met my lover later on, and she genuinely cared about me. She took down this barrier I had created, and I started feeling sympathy and other human emotions in the most intense manner, given that I already had a mood disorder and felt intensely. But people have not seen this growth, because they haven't talked to me personally. They act like I am still that very sadistic and immoral person, but I have actually become very moral and caring. The sadism is still there, but not as strong as before. At one point I even wanted to go to jail, feeling I had nothing to live for, anyway, but I no longer feel that way or have that desire. Never have I lied about my age, or anything online whatsoever, for that matter. Unless you count when I was 7 and told people I was a guy rather than a girl, lmao. There is also a misconception that I'm autistic and lack self awareness, but the issue is I have too much self awareness and I'm way too open and honest for my own good. My psychiatrist and psychologist have explicitly stated I'm not autistic. I think quite figuratively, while autistic people are literal. My writing is full of metaphors. Schizophrenics are like that in general, their lives are very symbolic. And yes, I still have my attraction, it hasn't \"gone away\" as some believe it would. And why would I lie about having it, who lies about something that they know would cause people to harass them nonstop. Like hello, I'm a sadist, not a masochist. And no, I have never harassed anyone who has harassed me. Yes, I did go to a mental hospital over the harassment.\n  ","351604":"\n  Interests: Helping people, writing long messages, writing stories, conducting research, learning, watching pornography, talking to my lover, psychology, psychiatry, neurology, drug research, documentaries, unusual fetishes, spaghetti, squirrels, kittens, yaoi, criminality, chess, CiCi's Pizza, GoGo's Crazy Bones, plushies, certain anime, spicy ramen, mahjong online, collecting journals, anime DVDs, books, games, and Lil Xan merch\n  \n  Favorite music: DGD, Lil Xan, and many more.

We've been together for around 2 and a half years. And no, it isn't an \"online relationship,\" considering we've met in person numerous times, and she has spent two summers at my house. I do not believe in love at first sight in real life because you cannot love someone without knowing anything about them (that is, the \"feelings\" people develop upon first sight are based on appearance).

Certainly, if someone experienced ongoing rape\/molestation as a child, they may normalize either the sexualization of children or family members, but that is a matter of probability, as not everyone does. There are various factors, but all sexual\/romantic feelings are natural given that they are not chosen. No one chooses who they are attracted to. I wouldn't necessarily call it \"dysfunctional.\" Perhaps a learned behavior, or perhaps just a natural phenomenon. If it is a learned behavior, there MAY be a chance of breaking the sexual\/romantic association with family, but I haven't read much about it so I'm not willing to suggest that it's \"curable.\" If not a learned behavior, then certainly not treatable. Nor worthy of condemnation, in either case. No one deserves to feel guilty for any sexual or romantic feelings they harbor, no matter the object of those feelings. Of course, there is a difference between having incestuous feelings versus acting upon them. I have no judgment either way, though offspring with a family member can result in birth defects, so I wouldn't recommend having children with someone you are related to.\n  ","351608":"\n  Veganism is like some infection that is rapidly spreading these days, perpetuated by people with superhero complexes who think they're saving animals from harm.

I think it is offensive for a white person to dress as a Native American, for instance, unless they bought the clothing from a Native American seller, because if they are selling it then they do not mind you having it, clearly.

It's evidence. It's thinking ahead. Plus if someone asks you for fun, \"What were you doing on January 3rd, 2020?\", you can show them exactly what you were doing that day.

Unfortunately this is when people give up on the relationship, finding it boring, not understanding that it is not supposed to be intense at all times. If all you want is intensity, do not bother being in a relationship with someone, because you are likely to cheat on them.

I regret sharing information that was too personal, and letting people take advantage of my kindness. I probably should have asked for therapy sooner, but it really is not my fault that I was showing signs of mental illness and my parents did nothing about it. They have always been blind to my well-being. I wish I saved my stories on documents, because at least then I would still have them, but I lost everything I had years ago, aside from one story. I wish I did more to maintain contact with my best friend. I also wish I did something about my compulsions sooner.\n  ","351638":"\n  It depends on the app\/site. In certain places I never even check my notifications for fear of someone saying something mean to me because I'm so conflict avoidant. On here I block obnoxious people whose polls I hate seeing, but it does nothing, so I guess there is no point. On social media platforms as a whole, I generally block people who argue with me because I have no time for that.\n  ","351639":"\n  It's not really an age thing, anyone can be attached to their abuser. This is why married women who are abused by their husbands do not get a divorce immediately. They hope that something will change, I suppose. A lot of it stems from behavioral conditioning during one's childhood. Like if you hear \"If a boy is mean to you, it means he likes you\" all the time, you begin thinking that abuse = love.\n  ","351640":"\n  So, you attract mean people either way. But they will either harass you or try to befriend you. And then despite befriending you they will harass you behind your back, because they hate everyone, especially themselves. And someone who resembles them in the slightest would thus be hated. Even those who are very different from them, because they only wish they could be nice. The world is run by envy.\n  ","351641":"\n  Yes. Not horoscopes, though. People seem to misunderstand and think zodiac signs and horoscopes are the same thing. They also only know of their sun sign, and thus think it is inaccurate solely based on that information, when there are many other signs in your birth chart. I personally find it useful regarding self-understanding and growth. Another thing I find foolish is when someone bashes another person for believing in zodiac signs. It's like attacking someone for their religious beliefs. Why not just allow people to be happy about what they believe in? Just because they fail to do research on the rest of their birth chart does not mean zodiac signs are inaccurate by default. Uneducated people will always make ignorant statements.\n  ","351642":"\n  Eh, there's no reason not to trust ANYONE, though. Not everyone is out to betray you or treat you differently. I try to treat everyone equally, at least, unless they've wronged me somehow. There are double standards all over the place, and people with an inferiority complex will always try to treat you as inferior, because they project. It is important to avoid people who project.\n  ","351643":"\n  Uh, yeah, me getting in trouble for using shotacon pictures on another site meanwhile guys used lolicon pictures all over the place and got away with it, but when it came to me it was suddenly breaking the rules.

Those guys used very suggestive pictures while mine were nothing in comparison.\n  ","351644":"\n  I eat ramen between 1:30 PM and around 2:15 PM every Saturday while watching a certain show (for now it is Big Time Rush). I translate French from 5:30 PM to around 6:20 PM every day (and then copy the translated portion on a document). I talk to my lover, I write every now and then, post on another website, look through Twitter, watch videos, read manga, and play games. I also do other miscellaneous things. I started rollerskating yesterday, for instance. I have two school assignments that I need to complete over the summer.\n  ","351645":"\n  Yeah, I just like words and patterns. Ever since I started hallucinating, my writing has shifted toward being metaphorical, because there is a connection between hallucinations\/delusions and a metaphorical way of thinking.

I never imagined I would even be in a relationship, and I did not mind the thought of being alone forever. But people should take pride in their loneliness, as it proves they can feel normal human emotions. It is only natural to be bothered by a lack of companionship. I'm not the type who seeks friends and such.\n  ","351650":"\n  When I was about 8 or 9, I started reading fanfictions, and not knowing what plagiarism was back then, I copied someone's fanfiction. They understandably got mad at me, and even removed their fanfiction from the site entirely. I apologized to them. It was not copied word for word, however, and I turned it into my own story about demons and people who lived in a house together in the middle of a forest. I ended up writing over 1,000 chapters of it in total (they were not very long), but years later the writing site I used went down without any prior warning, so I lost everything. I was interested in supernatural things, I guess. I always forget that I originally started off writing fanfictions. I only write original works\/characters nowadays.\n  ","351651":"\n  Maybe he had a change of heart? You never really know. Or maybe he really was just pretending to be nice. I wasn't aware you had cerebral palsy. It's not like I was mean to this kid for no reason, he was narcissistic and I got fed up with him boasting about how much money he had. He ended up lying to people and telling them we were dating, despite me not having any interest in him. He asked me to a school dance via a letter of sorts, but I threw it away without even reading it. He cried during class that day. It was kind of funny.\n  ","351652":"\n  Yeah, I think guys (and maybe girls) mistake someone's kindness for romantic interest. I asked to borrow a boy's pencil in middle school (but was mean to him during math class) and he developed a crush on me and followed me around school all the time. I do not understand this mindset of \"If someone's nice\/mean to me, it means they like me,\" I guess. I think you'll find someone when the time is right.\n  ","351653":"\n  Yes, I write about characters who are primarily based off of me, so my inspiration (aside from my lover) has a lot to do with my own emotions. My characters feel whatever I feel that day, you know. What is your screenplay about? I'm not good at planning ahead for my writing, it's very spontaneous, which is why I get stuck all the time. I hate when people go \"Just brainstorm to get rid of writer's block\" when not everyone enjoys brainstorming. Everyone works differently. 40 pages is still a good amount, though!\n  ","351654":"\n  Typing tests suck, I get anywhere from about 113 WPM-130+ WPM because they use a bunch of numbers, quotation marks, etc. I started using the internet at a young age, so I learned to type quickly. I'm sure you'll finish it if you dedicate time to it, though it can be hard to find time. Not to mention writer's block exists. I've been writing a story since 2017 and I'm only on chapter 10, so I feel you. Talent isn't wasted unless you waste it, in my opinion.\n  ","351655":"\n  I love this picture.\n  ","351656":"\n  Here is a statement I wrote yesterday that sums up my thoughts.\n  \n  \"I definitely support the black lives matter movement, and I think everyone is protesting for a good cause (that being the unnecessary murders of minorities). But I also think people are using the protest as an excuse to wreak havoc and steal from stores\/start fires... in other words, a breeding ground for criminal activity. I do not really support stealing from large businesses, even if everything may be insured, and I especially do not support stealing from small businesses that would be in much greater jeopardy. The stores are just scapegoats for everyone's anger. And while I understand the mentality behind them, and this whole \"riots are effective\" belief, I do not support crimes as a whole, both perpetrated by police and civilians. I imagine that people feel they must resort to violence because the police are gassing them, shooting them with rubber bullets, etc., all acts which cannot be justified if groups were peacefully protesting; there is evidence to prove the protests were truly peaceful before the police came along and started further accentuating that they are brutal and abuse their power. I am not in favor of the 'all cops are bad (ACAB)' statement because I believe generalizations are harmful, even if they may be used to get a point across, like in this case. And I find that there is an abundance of twisted logic, like individuals suggesting that white people are all racist to varying degrees, or cops are all racist by default simply for being in the police force. It is like stating that if you work at Chick-Fil-A, you are homophobic, because Chick-Fil-A supports homophobic organizations. Where you work\/what your job is does not necessarily reflect your own values and beliefs. Your job does not represent who you are and what you stand for. You are just trying to make money. Now, do not get me wrong, I do think that the police instigating violence by running over protesters and shooting them blind with rubber bullets ARE part of the problem. But being part of a certain system\/organization\/job is not an indicator of your character, and it is wrong to criticize an entire group rather than the ones inflicting harm. It is like punishing the entire class of students when only a handful were acting up. Racism and other things work the same way. Why treat all blacks like they are threats, or all police like they are threats? This is why I believe both mentalities are dangerous.\"\n  ","351657":"\n  Based on the chart you gave me, this individual is very sensitive and empathetic due to their moon being in Cancer. They prefer balance and dislike conflicts, and may act as a mediator in life. Their sun is not balanced with Uranus; they are eccentric and socially unconventional. They may act impulsively and prioritize their own needs. Their sun is also discordant with Neptune, meaning they have a tendency to be slothful and lack willpower. Because they strive for peace, they may be indecisive and slow to respond to stressful situations. They are easily upset\/taken advantage of because they trust others and have a strong sense of compassion. Their Venus is in harmony with other planets, meaning they are very passionate in love and commit themselves wholeheartedly to a relationship. They are helpful and attractive, but could use their charm as a manipulation tactic. They are imaginative and believe in soulmates. They are idealistic and thus may be disappointed when their partner does not live up to their expectations. Their Jupiter has a negative influence on Uranus and Neptune; they can be too impractical, irresolute, emotional, sentimental, and close-minded. They may focus on many things at once and thus never get anything accomplished. They are independent, determined, and creative, but can be unrealistically ambitious. Their Uranus is in harmony with Pluto, thus they care about reforming society and engaging in charitable acts. They are fair and compromising. Because Jupiter is in harmony with Saturn, they can indeed balance ideals\/practicality, if they work toward it. They are reliable, persistent, and a good friend. They sincerely care about the feelings of others. They are sensitive to criticism, and have a strong sense of intuition. Others may admire them for their emotional depth. They enjoy pleasing and nurturing others. You could think of them as a gentle parental figure. Because their Venus is in Virgo, they are perhaps shy and hesitant to express affection. They desire mutual trust in a relationship and can be a great listener. They are an observant perfectionist who likes order. Considering their Mercury is in Scorpio, they dislike superficiality and can easily see through others. Their Mars in Scorpio causes them to be very competitive and prepared for challenges. They are the type to appear calm on the outside but struggle with intense emotions on the inside. With their Pluto in Scorpio, they likely have a fascination with sexual taboos\/death, perhaps wanting to learn more about various crimes. Their Jupiter in Libra may bring good fortune and success in life. They love to learn, and favor things that are aesthetically pleasing. Their Saturn is in Aquarius, thus they may enjoy scientific information. They struggle to let go of their problems due to their inability to be open about their unpleasant emotions. They might feel that no one understands them, and that they are too \"different\" to fit in and be accepted.\n  ","351658":"\n  The mixture of Uranus and Neptune brings a sense of spirituality to your life; you are not afraid of the unknown, and instead seek to learn more about it. You may take an interest in conspiracy theories, the occult, etc. After looking at your chart, it seems the combination of Jupiter and Saturn will be detrimental to your life, in that you may lose passion and become depressed over a chronic boredom. You may try to alleviate this boredom with material goods, thinking it will solve your problems. You will criticize yourself for not achieving certain goals. It is important to lower your standards for yourself at times and not be too unrealistic or harsh. Most of your planets are balanced with each other and will not create discord in your life. For instance, Mars is in harmony with Jupiter, meaning you will maintain enthusiasm and vitality, and physical endeavors will greatly fulfill you. The 8th house is all about death, mystery, and dealing with life struggles. Venus in the 8th house means there is a sense of death\/macabre mixed in your relationships. As I stated earlier, this could mean one of your loved ones will die. But it could also mean that you can learn to cope with trauma\/pain through your relationship. You may also be forced to let a past part of yourself \"die\" for the sake of keeping your relationship afloat. This is, after all, the house of rebirth, meaning you will have to change and let go of things from your past. You might be controlling in a relationship and develop unhealthy habits such as manipulation, which you will have to relinquish. You will need to focus on bettering yourself as a person if you want a healthy relationship, is essentially what the combination of Saturn\/Venus in house 8 suggests. Your Mercury is in harmony with Uranus, meaning you enjoy intellectual stimulation and focusing on many projects at once, rather than limiting yourself to only one. You are interested in scientific knowledge and modern technology, and you dislike a slow-paced environment. Your sun in Aries and Mars in Leo combine in a positive way, making you confident, ambitious, and optimistic. Your Pluto negatively impacts Venus, causing you to be jealous and overly possessive in relationships. Your anger can be explosive, and you are likely to hurt your partners with your painful words, if you are not careful. You should certainly focus on what you can do to prevent toxic displays of emotion from letting loose. Remember, Saturn is all about self-improvement and preventing yourself from harming your relationship through psychological abuse. Because both Neptune and Uranus are in harmony with Pluto, however, you have the ability to make a positive impact on society and change your environment for the better. You like to be of service to others, and it is important to apply this same energy in your relationships, in which you are kind to your lovers and not too controlling.\n  ","351659":"\n  If your 7th house is empty, relationships might not be very troublesome, and you do not require them to be happy. It is natural to have at least one or two empty houses. This means there is no single sign that affects the house; however, the 6th house holds some influence over it. Venus in Pisces is quite a contrast to your moon\/sun in Aries in that you are sensitive and emotional towards love\/sex. It is a highly intuitive experience, and given that it is in your 8th house, you might experience death related to a relationship partner, or a loss of some sort. You likely will become wealthy through some means. You prioritize money and could find yourself shopping excessively. You are passionate about romance and like to give gifts to your partners. Because of this interest in obtaining money, you could be seen as superficial and greedy. You might even find yourself in a relationship with someone solely for their wealth. You like uncovering mysteries and learning your partners' secrets. You possess intense sexual energy and desire commitment from others. You will be passionate in love, but do not need it, if that makes sense?\n  ","351660":"\n  I am an aries moon. Someone with their moon in aries experiences a lot of anger, and will be ambitious and full of energy. This coupled with an aries sun creates an individual who enjoys confrontation and arguments. There is a sense of passion and intensity in life, and also maybe aggression. There is also a desire to compete with others. Because the moon sign is all about your emotions, you may feel impatient, impulsive, and easily irritated. You may walk quickly and not think before you speak. You focus on physical activities, such as different sports. You are spontaneous and always seeking thrill. Your sun sign is about your ego and how you perceive yourself, so you may think you are exciting and adventurous. Your rising sign is about how other people see you, and the first impression you make on them. Leos are seen as confident and kind of pretentious. You come off as powerful, authoritative, and charming. You seem to not accept criticism and only talk to those who agree with you. You are optimistic and outgoing, and people might see you as extroverted and a bit domineering. You have a compelling vibe and seem confident on the surface. Your aries moon likely brings confidence, too. You are perceived as a leader who likes to be in control of things. You can be dramatic at times, and good at acting. You enjoy your independence and expressing yourself to others. You are capable, responsible, and hardworking. You are also blunt and honest. You are assertive and feel strongly about your opinions. Others might be overwhelmed by your passion for life. You could find it difficult to apologize and back down from a fight, leading others to believe you are insensitive. But you are brave and not easily scared or intimidated. You are action-oriented and take pride in your achievements. You prefer not to dwell on things; you are perhaps not very secretive or sad. You love new experiences and hate routine and repetition. You are enthusiastic, but you might struggle with feelings of wrath or envy. You try your best, because you feel success is important.\n  \n  Your venus sign tells about how you behave in a relationship, if you're interested.\n  \n  Sorry if my response wasn't the best!\n  ","351661":"\n  I cannot sleep if there are sounds around me.

It is easy to go into major debt. Medicine can cost thousands of dollars without insurance, as well. I assure you that a month's worth of medicine did not cost $40,000 to produce, so why does it cost that much to buy it?

One girl gave this awful story of being locked in her mother's (?) closet for days. She had an extensive background of abuse and neglect, going from step parent to step parent because they were all horrible people. I do not really remember all the details, given that it's been over a year, but the memory of her sharing her experiences stayed with me. I hope she is in a better place now.\n  ","351673":"\n  There is this game I have been wanting since 6th grade, but I was never able to download the English version of it because an error message would always pop up when I tried to play the .exe file.

I would rather delay any potential car crash for as long as possible.\n  ","351676":"\n  I really haven't, though. I've spent years helping people online out of suicide and have a lot of experience in that field. As someone who has been suicidal for years, myself, I understand how it feels. But to me it makes little sense to be suicidal over something you have control over. Rather than complaining about making mistakes, make better choices to redeem yourself. Instead of calling yourself a terrible person and such, maybe work on becoming a better person. It is only natural to be suicidal over unpleasant things one has no control over, but you have control over your own decisions and character. Take responsibility.\n  ","351677":"\n  There are too many cartoons to choose from.

My mom had to take me to the emergency room and I was put on breathing treatments. I could have died that day. I have no memory of it, but I contracted bronchiolitis as a child, too, and I was dying from it. I survived in the end. I have almost drowned at the beach multiple times. On one occasion, one of my sisters had her friend come with us. I went out to sea with them and the waves dragged us far away from the sand. We could not swim back to shore due to all the resistance. I got on one of their backs, and luckily we eventually reached the shore again, despite almost drowning.

It is what you call \"going gay\" for someone. I think if you truly love someone as a person, you can overlook their sex. I find it superficial to not be with someone solely because you are not gay. It is not me being in denial, I am simply not attracted to females. If I were, it would make no sense to deny that rather than deny my \"taboo\" attraction that is frowned upon. Considering I am open about that, if I were attracted to my own sex, I would also be open about that.\n  ","351681":"\n  I think it depends on who you ask. Writing can be literal or figurative, and poetry is a form of writing. Poetry could mimic song lyrics and have a certain \"beat.\" Music can be literal or figurative, as well. Art can be abstract or realistic. Music often requires different instruments, much like painting requires different tools. With writing you just need a pen\/pencil and paper, or a computer keyboard and document. Writing (a novel or something) is more like music in the sense that they generally both involve words, and writing song lyrics is of course a form of writing. I guess they coincide. Paintings are about the image, songs tend to be about the emotion, and writing is often a mixture of both. I would say it is more like music, though.\n  ","351682":"\n  Habit? I do not really have habits but rather compulsions, like constantly checking that my phone is in my bag, looking inside every cup to see if it is spotless or not, checking for my bracelet and rings all the time (in case they have fallen off somehow), checking to see if there is any blood in a bathroom stall so I can avoid it (I think some girls use period blood as self-expression), and so on. I used to have the compulsion of watching at least 27 anime episodes a day. I became anxious whenever I watched any less than that. I did not really have obsessive thoughts like \"If I do not watch 27 episodes then my family will die\" or anything. These days I have many obsessive thoughts, however. Not the one mentioned, that is just a common example people use.

It depends on the type of name you want, though. My stories are set in a kind of European-style Japan, so the characters have Japanese names, or Japanese sounding names. I think I wanted to name a character Shun but came up with Shunchou instead, for example. I take pride in coming up with Ritemo and Shenzo, they are good names.\n  ","351687":"\n  You should not measure your worth and beauty based on whether you are dating someone or not. I believe love only comes when necessary, and when you are not searching for it. People are also inherently drawn to someone who is hopeful and optimistic. But well, I have trouble understanding in this regard because I was never interested in being in a relationship, it simply happened. This is why I believe it is best to wait, if you are someone who desires a relationship. Good things come to those who wait, after all. Unless you are a bad person, then karma will eventually beat you.\n  ","351688":"\n  Chips because I cannot live without them on my sandwich and I think their presence there represents how no one wants me on their sandwich (who knows what this means metaphorically) but I want me there. The fact that people eat soft, squishy sandwiches instead of putting chips on them amazes me because it is so disgusting. I have yet to meet someone else who puts them on their sandwiches even though it is superior. \ud83d\ude14\n  ","351689":"\n  The only thing that works is resolving the problem at hand. If that is impossible (in the sense that you have no control over it) then all you can do is alter your perceptions by focusing on more favorable aspects of life. Look at the smaller things that make you happy. Herons make me happy, and eating spicy ramen every Saturday, for instance. Things could always inevitably be worse, and it is good to keep that fact in mind. I was suicidal for years and even had to go to a mental hospital but I feel great nowadays, you know, and I've grown to the point where even major things do not disrupt the peace. There is always light at the end of the tunnel, even if there remain obstructions obscuring it from view. What I've learned is that you need to appreciate little things more, like plants or birds. Distracting yourself from your sadness is not beneficial nor does it accomplish anything. I think all you can do is prevent yourself from getting sad in the first place. It is understandable to be sad in response to certain things, such as the death of a family member, but even then things could be worse. What if two family members had died, rather than one? I think every bad incident is a lesson and sadness leads to growth. Even if a plant wilts, it can always thrive again. Certain plants end up dying, but if you are the wilting plant, all you can do is provide yourself with the proper care needed to prosper. The best care is achieved through meeting your own emotional\/physical needs.\n  \n  Anyway, I'm rambling too much. Just ask: Why am I sad? What can I do about this feeling?\n  \n  If there is something that can be done, you need to do it. Do not wait before things worsen.\n  \n  If nothing can be done, all you can do is change your internal dialogue and think positive affirmations, as well as focusing on more pleasant things.\n  \n  Feeling sad for no reason? Think again. There is always a reason.\n  ","351690":"\n  I was obsessed with Big Time Rush when I was younger and a boy from my sociology class mentioned watching the entire show a week or two ago, so I thought to look it up again. The band and show bring so much joy to my life again and I feel very pleasant these days. It further reinforces my philosophy that joyous experiences should not be left behind but rather brought back. Did a particular show make you happy as a child? Watch it again. Was it a game? Immerse yourself in the game once more. Do not leave your happiness behind. Relive whatever made you happy in the past--so long as it is not unhealthy.\n  ","351691":"\n  It depends on the severity of the autism. Some autistic people are highly dysfunctional. In any case, such crazy parents focus on the rare severe allergic reactions to vaccines rather than understanding that they help the majority of people; moreover, the \"vaccines cause autism\" belief stems from an old article without conclusive evidence behind it, so they care more about their convictions than data and logic. It isn't bad to be autistic, but I think they are referring to more extreme cases. I think these parents have a fetish for endangering and possibly killing their own children due to their own passion for ignorance.\n  ","351692":"\n  The fact that people have more than one lover\/sexual partner throughout their lives. It is not true devotion if you give yourself to multiple people, and your feelings were never truly sincere if you can love someone else. To me, love is something permanent. Maybe it is a traditional or strict way of seeing things but that is what I think. And no, it is not a religious thing, I am an atheist. I just believe in monogamy very strongly.\n  ","351693":"\n  Make them be more stable, but that would require several things. I wish my father would stop drinking and smoking, and drunk driving while I'm in the car with him. I wish my sisters weren't bitchy stalkers and that they asked me things to my face. I wish my mother did not cry all the time. I wish my parents could go without fighting. I wish my father were nice to me and could stop treating me as if I am full blown psychotic even though I am on medicine and rarely hallucinate anymore. Still paranoid but it is warranted. I wish my mother actually listened to me instead of ranting about her own things all the time. I wish everyone took the time to understand me better. I wish I never had to witness my father hurt my mother physically. I really just hate my family.\n  ","351694":"\n  I was never afraid, I just thought I was incapable of feeling love or care, because I was so numb and detached from reality and human emotions. I always told people I would never get into a relationship because it seemed impossible, especially considering that my atttaction to adults has been so limited. I did end up falling in love, however, when I felt truly understood and cared for. Finally someone accepted me as a person. I suppose I tried suppressing it because I thought my feelings would never be reciprocated. But eventually I did provide a confession of sorts. I've always found it miraculous that two people traditionally attracted to certain groups could love each other despite the fact that we happen to delineate from said groups. It was fate, really.\n  ","351695":"\n  Flirting, cuddling, cuddling roleplaying, kissing, any affectionate or sexual roleplay, obviously having sex with someone else, holding hands with them (only acceptable if they're a family member), sitting on someone else, writing anything romantic to someone else, suggestively lying down with them, basically doing anything remotely physical or too emotional.\n  ","351696":"\n  I understand. I think that you may want to reconsider your career choice if you feel your current stress outweighs any possible gratification from said job in the future. That is, if you feel it isn't worth it to keep going along this route. But if you truly love what you plan to do, then you will be able to overcome any obstactles preventing you from getting there in the meantime. However, it is difficult to know if you will love it until you get there. But it is likely that what you are studying is reflective of the type of material you will be needing when the time comes. If you do not enjoy what you are studying, you may not enjoy the job itself, either.\n  ","351697":"\n  I apologize for the horrible image quality, but my rabbit bracelet is the best thing.\n  ","351698":"\n  Sorry for reposting this answer, it had a few grammatical errors\/some repetition that I wanted to fix.\n  \n  It's alright, thank you for listening and being willing to learn more. It's very hypocritical of the gay community to go on about how they can't help who they're sexually attracted to but then they turn around and discriminate against pedophiles\/hebephiles\/ephebophiles for the exact same thing. You would think they would be understanding when really they treat others with the same contempt. Not every person who is attracted to children intends to offend in any way, as not everyone has low self control, which society seems to assume. Most people who are attracted to children are also not exclusively attracted to them--in fact, only a small percentage are. This means they can be attracted to adults and have families. And no, that does not inevitably mean they are attracted to their own children. If you would not be sexually attracted to your own sibling, why would they be attracted to their own child? They're people like anyone else. It is a myth that they were all sexually abused. Certain MAPs (minor-attracted persons) just had an early puberty, and I do believe there is a correlation there. They tend to also be distressed by their attraction; who would not be distressed if society condemns them and wants them to be tortured and killed for something they did not choose? Some of them go on to commit suicide. In general they suffer in silence because they have no choice. They have no \"parades\" as homosexuals do. I do not believe I know of any who do not have some sort of mental illness; Schizophrenia, autism, and bipolar disorder are common. Immense guilt can actually trigger hallucinations and the onset of Schizophrenia. People have this odd belief that therapy will cure them, but just as it cannot cure someone who is gay, it cannot cure someone who is attracted to children. Most MAPs realize they are attracted to children when they are between the ages of 12-16. Women may also be MAPs, but people assume only men can be MAPs, likely because they associate an attraction to minors with sexual violence, and men are more commonly perceived as violent. If you want more information, there are research articles available online. Or you can ask me something and I'll reply.\n  ","351699":"\n  All you hear is people being ignorant, but it does not take much to actually look into something. If you did, you would learn that only about 1\/2 of people who are attracted to children are sex offenders. And ignorant idiots also believe pedophiles are attracted to teens when they are attracted to prepubescent children. Hebephiles are attracted to children who are about 13-15 and ephebophiles are attracted to children who are 16-19. Ages may vary slightly. But no one cares, they just make foolish generalizations and act like they are correct. It is ignorance and the demonization of these groups that causes them to offend in the first place. Naturally if society hates you then you will act out. It is unjustified to hate someone who has not even committed any crime. No one chooses who they are attracted to.\n  ","351700":"\n  I think when someone becomes satisfied with their relationship, their feelings are of a more peaceful nature, rather than a very passionate\/obsessive one. Maybe you are mistaking this complacency\/peace with feeling nothing? Indifference and peace are somewhere on the same spectrum. But if you think this is not the case and you are genuinely feeling nothing, I guess you never truly loved him to begin with, because true love lasts forever and superficial \"love\" dies.\n  ","351701":"\n  No. I find it foolish to sacrifice your health for the sake of your superhero complex where you delusionally convince yourself you are helping animals and shit. These pathetic people end up not getting the proper nutrients they need and yet they claim their diet is \"natural,\" when something that is natural is physically fulfilling, and that is simply not. We have some sharp teeth because we are meant to consume meat, and opposing your biological needs is irrational and quite frankly I believe these people have an eating disorder. You have vitamin deficiencies but your hysterical self wants to believe you are actually helping animals. How funny to ruin your health for the sake of helping animals you are not even helping. Your diet is not preventing them from being killed and eaten. You are nothing.\n  ","351702":"\n  I'm not really sure. I think I am happier now, but more stressed than ever. I'm just glad my medicine works. I have left unpleasant people behind. My states are less severe. Winter is gone, luckily. And that boy who took my seat at lunch is gone. I do not have to deal with certain classes anymore. I feel less paranoid about bugs outside. I am less angry. <-<\n  ","351703":"\n  I love horror movies, but I find jump scares to be predictable and cheap; unfortunately producers have a tendency to rely on them as a means of providing their intended effect. Movies in general should set a better atmosphere, and I wish they were more abstract and interpretative. I love figurative works, but many movies are very direct and in-your-face. To me, there is little point in watching something unless it really makes you think. Not to suggest I only watch very thoughtful movies, but I think they are far more interesting. Something atmospheric and beautiful like Nekromantik or Tommy.\n  ","351704":"\n  I really want one of those loot crates that come in the mail every month, but I do not have any money for it. Dresses I like can be rather expensive. The things I want are generally around $20-40, I'd say, so not too expensive. I want to collect anime figures, but they tend to be very expensive and I do not have the money. My family is rather broke and I do not personally have a job because I have no time for it and I have too many physical problems to work (cannot stand for more than like 10 minutes without back pain because I have low vitamin D, but vitamin D supplements are not helping me... I have neck pain, wrist problems, always pain in the most random parts, etc.). I do not come from a background of wealth.\n  ","351705":"\n  Relatively quiet, aside from when people decide to throw a party. No crime here. The houses kind of look the same. The neighbors are nasty bitches, and the people who run the neighborhood have ridiculous rules, such as how you are not allowed to paint your mailbox a different color. The people who own the neighborhood also threatened us for having a car on the road in front of the house, even though many other people also have cars there and they are not threatened, so.\n  ","351706":"\n  I try to focus on the major tasks first, and think about the fact that there will be better times where I am less overwhelmed, and for now I just need to do what I must. I think it helps to think about each thing individually instead of how many things you have to do as a whole. The big picture can be overwhelming to look at, so it is better to look at small sections of that picture.\n  ","351707":"\n  There are of course some bad Scorpios out there. But one thing that is misinterpeted is their manipulation. It does not come from a place of ill will. Scorpios are very private people, not because they are trying to hide things but because they feel as if they would be misunderstood if they spoke about themselves, anyway. People also mistakenly associate secrets with lying, but Scorpios are very honest and blunt people.\n  ","351708":"\n  I'm glad!\n  ","351709":"\n  \\o\/\n  ","351710":"\n  I mean, I understand if they cannot afford a therapist and they are trying to reach out to someone, but many of them just want attention, sadly.

As for the things that do, well, it is just obvious they are unhealthy, like self-harm and such (which I did not do, prior to 2018, really). I think my porn addiction was unhealthy, not because it warped my perception of sex or anything, but because I was very desensitized to hardcore genres and always needed to find something even more extreme, like videos of people being killed and their body parts cut off, or animals being injured. I was always watching eel porn, defecation porn, etc. All I thought about was watching porn. I had difficulty focusing on things due to my fantasies. I still watch porn, of course, but generally milder forms, and I do not spend nearly as much time on it as I used to. As well, certain fantasies were distressing, but I learned to get rid of them. I was aware my hallucinations, delusions, and derealization\/depersonalization were all unhealthy, which certainly makes me more self-aware than other Schizophrenics. Thus I requested to be put on medicine, which I am still on. I think what is most harmful is the denial of the true self. Initially I was in denial about my attraction, for instance, but quickly grew to accept it. Denial does not make things go away. Some people have this notion that it will just go away over time. But I have consciously been aware of such feelings since early 2016. There is no cure, and you cannot choose for it to go away, just as you never chose to have it. Apart from self-denial, the most unhealthy things in the world, to me, are assumptions and ignorance. They are absolutely everywhere, unfortunately.\n  ","351713":"\n  It depends. I generally refrain from discussing certain things that bother me. I do not wish to embarrass myself by speaking on something I was not asked about (in real life, I mean). Sometimes I feel ambitious enough to share my views on things and actually speak up for once, but most of the time I do not bother because nothing comes of it, anyway. I am bothered by many things, but no one wants to hear the long list of irritants, so I do not really talk about them. You of course know of all the things that bother me, but generally if I am not asked about my opinion on something, I am not compelled to share it. One thing I find very annoying is when someone goes on and on about the things that bother them when no one fucking asked. It is one thing to write of your likes and dislikes in their respective place, and another to spew your thoughts wherever you go. There is a time and place for everything, and if it is not the correct time and place, I am not interested in discussing what bothers me. But if asked, sure, I would be very outspoken; I have no qualms about sharing such things if asked.\n  ","351714":"\n  Yes, tremendously so. Last year my feelings of empathy and care had just started developing, really, but at this point I have gotten used to them. Last year I was incredibly unstable and suicidal, and my moods were unpredictable and very intense. This is as opposed to 2017, when I suppressed how I felt, did not harbor feelings of empathy or care, and was essentially robotic and highly derealized. I started feeling more attached to my surroundings in 2018, but I was very scattered and disoriented as a person. As of 2019 I am gradually becoming more peaceful and composed without constantly suppressing myself. I was suppressing my anger in 2017, and frequently had homicidal thoughts. I found ways of dealing with this anger in 2018 that did not involve homicide or injuring anyone\/anything without their consent. Now (in 2019) I do not feel very angry at all (but I remain easily irritated by people who choose to be ignorant and incorrect, as I am compelled to correct everything). It is not as hard to deal with my emotions, and though I have days in which I despair again, they are not as common or intense as they used to be. I am not as interested in others' lives at the moment because I am still working on straightening out my own. I am not that cruel and very devious person that people likely still believe me to be. It is not my problem if you are still obsessing over the past me, but hey, at least I've always been honest about myself. I still have the same interests as always, but in the span of a couple of years I've gone from an immoral porn addict to a very lawful and moral person who just has a high libido. Not a porn addict anymore; as stated, I am still interested in the same things, sexually speaking, but I am just paying less attention to them. In the past I planned to commit a crime and go to jail, but now I am not interested in such a thing. If I was, I would continue to state such; I have always been open about things I wish to do in the future. I am not a \"danger to society\" anymore, as some would suggest. I am more interested in collecting bird feathers and smiling over the rabbit plushie hanging on my doorknob and watching cat videos all the time than I am in indulging in anything criminal or \"wrong.\" Now I am just someone who cries over videos of physically injured animals, cries when they hear that a stranger died. I am only human now. My innocence is just more prominent than my deviance these days. I still have many paraphilias, and the same taboo attraction I've had for years, which others condemn me for. But I do not spend time fantasizing about things as I used to. I just want to write, take care of my plants, read about astrology, drugs, and disorders. These days I am thinking about the numerous animals I want to have in the future, not how I want to torture and kill someone someday. And that is all there is to it. I am a better person now, whether anyone wants to accept that or not. ~ Yaoi\n  ","351715":"\n  I think they refer to any mild crush as them being in love, as they use it even when they know nothing about the person. Yes, I think they are too quick to form a concrete opinion based on a single bad experience. I wouldn't quite call my relationship an \"online relationship\" because we've spent months together in person, but it is long distance and we talk primarily online. I think online dating also depends a lot on trust and faith in the other person, that they would not hook up with someone in real life while being with you online. Because certain people rely heavily on the physical aspect of a relationship and could never go months or even years without touching their significant other. You need to have patience and be devoted, otherwise things are bound to fail. But that is all my opinion on the matter--other people do not take online relationships seriously and then wonder why a breakup happens. Anyway, thanks for the question, and I hope I answered it well enough!\n  ","351716":"\n  I agree, and I think people are becoming more and more superficial and materialistic over time. Not to mention the rise of casual sex and people spewing the word \"love\" so easily and without a second thought to the true meaning and value of the word. I think it is ignorant of people to claim online dating will never work out, just because it did not work out for them personally. Experiences are subjective and you cannot assume someone else's experience will be the same as yours. I think whether a relationship works out, online or not, is always dependent on the people within it (and certain environmental factors, of course). Just do not hook up with someone who will not value you and the relationship to the same extent that you do. I'm glad I was one of the people who answered logically, haha. I wish people were more considerate and thoughtful about things. It's just like them saying that true love doesn't exist simply because they had bad experiences. Do not project your own experiences on to other people, because they are not the same as you.\n  ","351717":"\n  Most people are too superficial and impatient for an online relationship to work out. But if you and your significant other are both mature, serious, and patient individuals, then things may work out. The issue is that flippant people jump into a relationship and expect it to work out without putting any effort and care into it. In other words, it's an individual case when it comes to whether online dating will be good for you or not. But I've been with my lover (whom I met online) for almost two years now and things are working out fine.\n  ","351718":"\n  When I went to the beach and collected dragonfly wings. I am very afraid of bugs, but I'm trying to gradually become less afraid of them. I cringed when I got home and had to pull the wings out of a bag because the fear returned, but I'm proud of myself for collecting them in the first place. And still having them. Yes, the wings were floating in the beach water, alongside many stray seagull feathers which I also took.\n  ","351719":"\n  Yes, I went to three different elementary schools because we kept moving.

I have a very particular sense of humor that is kind of hard to understand, but they got it. One of my friends actually barked at people and attacked them. She was goth and a heavy metal fan. My best friend, she liked watching wrestling, and she raved about different YouTubers all the time. She always wore black, and her mother was intimidating. She was traditionally weird, in a funny way, while the heavy metal girl was weird in an outcast sort of way. I had another friend who was nothing like those two. She was obsessed with animals and rather feminine, but she was weird, too, in a humorous way. She was always searching for hot guys to obsess over. Then there was my friend in 3rd grade, and she was very sexual and a Scorpio like me. Unlike me, however, she was interested in the outdoors and actually doing things, and I just wanted to be inside all day and stay on the computer. We grew apart because she and my best friend hated each other and were always fighting over me. There was a girl I was friends with in 6th grade, and our common interest was anime. But she was extroverted (unlike any of my other friends) and very clingy. She was very touchy-feely and made me feel uncomfortable a lot of the time because I knew she had feelings for me. She was exuberant and lively, but easily irritated. I was stubborn and she was always making me do things I did not want to do. I'm not quite sure which trait all of my friends shared, because they were generally different from each other. I got along with masculine girls with dark interests and feminine girls who were very lively, I'd say. I just prefer to become friends with someone who is not judgmental, and who understands my energy.\n  ","351729":"\n  Um, I do not think they are on my phone.

Here is one of my personal favorites.\n  \n  \"It terrifies me\n  \n  You can cause an echo a thousand times louder than I\n  \n  You see what you see\n  \n  I actually have dreams about all the ways you could die\n  \n  I plead, your foundation crumbles at your feet,\n  \n  But you still somehow manage to keep\n  \n  Armies of worms underneath\n  \n  To squish on a killing spree\n  \n  Others' lives are cheap\n  \n  Others' lives are cheap\n  \n  You would call the blue sky red with no shame\n  \n  You're goddamn insane\n  \n  You would call the blue sky red with no shame\n  \n  You're goddamn insane\n  \n  We're better than you\n  \n  In every way that counts, and we still have our souls\n  \n  We plan what we do\n  \n  With two feet on the ground, and we're still in control\n  \n  I plead, your foundation crumbles at your feet,\n  \n  But you still somehow manage to keep\n  \n  Armies of worms underneath\n  \n  To squish on a killing spree\n  \n  Others' lives are cheap\n  \n  Others' lives are cheap\n  \n  You would call the blue sky red with no shame\n  \n  You're goddamn insane\n  \n  You would call the blue sky red with no shame\n  \n  You're goddamn insane\n  \n  You would call the blue sky red with no shame\n  \n  You're goddamn insane\n  \n  Feeling the words echo off the walls\n  \n  They find much more meaning in their decay\n  \n  Though they were meant to mean nothing at all\n  \n  When clumsily sputtered from my drunken face\n  \n  You would call the blue sky red with no shame\n  \n  You're goddamn insane\n  \n  You would call the blue sky red with no shame\n  \n  You're goddamn insane\"\n  ","351767":"\n  No.\n  ","351768":"\n  Cookies, brownies, KitKats, gushers, Swedish fish, gummy bears, sour patch kids, Oreos (also falls under cookies), chocolate cake, chocolate pie, chocolate ice cream, chocolate everything, cheesecake, angel food cake, banana bread, blueberry donuts, danishes, fudge, cinammon buns, cherry pie, apple pie, lemon pie, pecan pie, banana pudding, ice cream cake, and I could go on.\n  ","351769":"\n  Someone who is honest, direct, loyal, accountable, responsible, respectful, tactful, serious, formal, authentic, open, open minded, modest, humble, logical, dependable, reasonable, rational, realistic, insightful, introspective, practical, and independent.

And your taste is better. ~\n  ","351798":"\n  Unless you plant a tree in your house, I do not imagine that would be a very good idea. But of course I want cicadas, they make beautiful sounds. They are just frightening and I do not want them near me, haha. I wish they could be a part of a garden, yes.\n  ","351799":"\n  It depends on my mood and what I would do if I had more time that day. I wish I could spend an hour writing each day, so likely that.\n  ","351800":"\n  I cannot cook anything, so anything that appeals to me, I suppose. Especially spaghetti.\n  ","351801":"\n  Not getting distracted while writing.\n  ","351802":"\n  Myself, primarily. But that aside, people's experiences, certain songs, quotes, characters I relate to, different shows.\n  ","351803":"\n  You would ask this question every day, if you could.\n  ","351804":"\n  Ones that are loose and lively.\n  ","351805":"\n  Do you mean from a novel? Nothing quite comes to mind, but when I was younger, I was obsessed with Toklo from the Seekers series. I do not recall much about his character, other than the fact that he was rather domineering and protective.\n  ","351806":"\n  I do not have one.\n  ","351807":"\n  Through writing. I am a very complex and clever person, and I hope my writing gets this message across, with the unusual metaphors and such.\n  ","351808":"\n  I've only ever loved one person. It took about two months, I believe. We've been together for over a year.\n  ","351809":"\n  Thanks. I mistakenly replied to myself instead of you many months ago.\n  ","351810":"\n  Wait, why cicada. They are scary. Do you mean chinchilla? I want one of those.\n  ","351811":"\n  Alter their mindset and thoughts toward said thing. Perceptions may be fleeting, lest you instill in yourself a new set of thoughts and adhere to them.\n  ","351812":"\n  Brilliant, of course.\n  ","351813":"\n  Autobiographies.\n  ","351814":"\n  You mean annoying phrases like \"Give me the tea,\" or?\n  ","351815":"\n  You will see on this list songs that are primarily from the early 2000s, because that is my favorite music period.\n  \n  Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go by Wham!\n  \n  Shake It by Metro Station\n  \n  Bend It by Dave Dee\n  \n  Virtually every classic Christmas song\n  \n  Sweet Talk and I'm Not Crying, You're Not Crying, Are You? by Dear and the Headlights\n  \n  Collar Full by Panic!

And if she ever thinks about me. It felt like she abandoned me. It's been years since we last spoke to each other.\n  ","351817":"\n  Why I am the way I am. And that I will always be this way.\n  ","351818":"\n  Something Lil Xan related, honestly. Or anything I am craving or compelled to have. I have random impulses to buy certain things, and it is nice if I can get them. I like things that are handmade, such as bracelets and drawings.\n  ","351819":"\n  I like to describe characters of mine and what their intentions and tendencies are. I can go very in depth about them. I like to describe my hallucinations and the intensity of my feelings. I enjoy describing my perceptions and how I interpret and experience things. Hm, and my childhood. It was pleasant.\n  ","351820":"\n  I've stopped making as many careless mistakes as I did in the past, due to the realization that it was indeed a self-fulfilled prophecy in which I would fear that I would make a mistake and then unconsciously proceeded to in order to alleviate this paranoia. I am beginning to trust my gut feeling more and allow it to dictate how I feel, rather than letting hope interfere and foolishly believing that perhaps I am wrong. I find it easier to speak my thoughts, instead of suppressing them. Over time, I have developed the ability to sympathize and feel care, which was unprecedented in 2017. I was genuinely an unfeeling robot. I also rarely feel anger, whereas in the past I had visions of harming others and frequently mulled over the thought of it. I also planned to go to jail, and this has changed. In a sense, I began valuing myself more, for in the past I did not have any regard for what would happen to me. I've become much more open and expressive over time, and I established virtues and some semblance of a moral code. I only dedicate time to those who deserve it, while in the past I talked to uninteresting people with the hope of them becoming intriguing over time. This was never the case. I no longer admire someone without a very good reason. My ability to read people has been refined. I have become highly logical and serious over the span of a few years, which I am proud of. My writing has improved significantly and has become more figurative than literal, due to the onslaught of my hallucinations and such. I used to let people take advantage of my tolerance, but I developed a sense of self respect. I've become much more laidback, while in the past I was constantly uptight and furious. I've learned to let loose, so to speak. I try to watch what I say before coming off as cruel. I believe that is all.\n  ","351821":"\n  There should be a name for falling while going up the stairs, if there isn't one already. And the name for when I react to my medicine and feel nauseous and like my entire body is burning. Or when you have never taken a type of medicine before and take 50 mg from the start, rather than 25, and get blurry vision, ringing ears, and vomiting. You cannot quite call that an overdose, hm. Or perhaps. There should be a term for always being able to sense when a bug is nearby. Or picking at acne. There should also be a name for the headaches associated with a concussion in particular. And a term for those who are attracted to pedophiles. But for all I know, there could be names for all of these things.\n  ","351822":"\n  Will they stay or will they go?\n  ","351823":"\n  If it is unwarranted.\n  ","351824":"\n  I cannot sleep with lights or sound, so I have to be in complete darkness and silence. If my mind is racing, I focus on my breathing, and this allows me to fall asleep.\n  ","351825":"\n  Incriminating pedophiles.\n  ","351826":"\n  Rubber chickens. And the face of the man in jail on the Monopoly board.\n  ","351827":"\n  The red Camaro that Matt has in Death Note.\n  ","351828":"\n  I am not religious, but Christmas is my favorite holiday.\n  ","351829":"\n  I do not have an ex.\n  ","351830":"\n  When I lose something.\n  ","351831":"\n  Yes, romantic and very nurturing. I am a sentimental person.\n  ","351832":"\n  Moths, gnats, dragonflies, butterflies, ladybugs, silverfish, carpet beetles, maggots, flies (especially fruit flies), grasshoppers, mosquitoes, bees (somewhat), daddy long legs, ants, fleas, cicadas, bed bugs (never seen any in person, however), lice (also never seen any in person), crane flies, and firebrats (I recently discovered that these are the bugs I occasionally find in my room). I am more afraid of spider webs than spiders themselves. Wasps are rather cute, and I love praying mantises. I sexualize many bugs so as to be afraid to a lesser extent.\n  ","351833":"\n  Hm. Dilapidated, compensate, contemplate, parsimonious, equivalent, permeate, illuminate, perpetuate, perplexing, sclera, effervescent, taciturn, stentorian, fickle, mendacious, placate, clamor, and thwarted.\n  ","351834":"\n  Japanese rock gardens.\n  ","351835":"\n  Freud's theory of repressed incestuous desires because there is no logical basis for it. I dislike the word aesthetic, as it is primarily used by snowflakes. Oh, and I do not believe in the whole gender identity crisis shit.\n  ","351836":"\n  Banjo music.\n  ","351837":"\n  Children.\n  ","351838":"\n  A change in perception.\n  ","351839":"\n  I am not sure. Some words I like are enamored, defenestrated, abated, emaciated, volatile, trifle, perpetual, profound, detrimental, percolate, haughty, compromise, resplendent, serpentine, succulent, and I could go on.\n  ","351840":"\n  I want to read classic novels and memoirs about mental disorders and drug abuse. I plan to watch Nekromantik in its entirety someday. Other than that, no specific titles come to mind. I have little interest in movies and just watch random ones or ones that are recommended. Oh, and I suppose I would like to watch A Quiet Place.\n  ","351841":"\n  When someone is prevented from succeeding, yet they do it, anyway, rather than dwelling on self pity. For instance, a deaf person learning to sing well.\n  ","351842":"\n  I enjoy it, but I'm broke, so there is not much traveling going on.\n  ","351843":"\n  No.\n  ","351844":"\n  See previous answer.\n  ","351845":"\n  Going to the amusement park and CiCi's with you.\n  ","351846":"\n  You are the only cute one. ~\n  ","351847":"\n  Cherry blossoms, sunflowers, dandelions, and tulips. I do not know many types of flowers.\n  ","351848":"\n  You.\n  ","351849":"\n  Cutie!!! Sugar glider, chinchilla, cats, leopard gecko, snake, ferret, fish (mainly shrimp), rabbit, a quiet bird, hermit crab, frogs, turtles, uh. I think that is all. Oh, and maybe a goose. And a chicken. And a raccoon. I want many things.\n  ","351850":"\n  That's a difficult one. But I like the lyrics to Ich Tu Dir Weh.\n  \n  Here's the English translation:\n  \n  \"You live only for me\n  \n  I stick medals into your face\n  \n  You are entirely devoted to me\n  \n  You love me because I don't love you\n  \n\n  You bleed for my salvation\n  \n  A little cut and you're turned on\n  \n  The body already completely disfigured\n  \n  It doesn't matter, whatever pleases is allowed\n  \n\n  I hurt you\n  \n  I'm not sorry\n  \n  It's good for you\n  \n  Hear how it screams\n  \n\n  With you I have the choice of torment\n  \n  Barbed wire in the urethral tract\n  \n  Throw your flesh in salt and pus\n  \n  At first you die, but then you live more\n  \n\n  Bites, kicks, hard blows\n  \n  Needles, pliers, a blunt saw\n  \n  What you wish, I don't say no\n  \n  And insert rodents into you\"\n  ","351851":"\n  Candles, especially vanilla and birthday cake scented ones.\n  ","351852":"\n  Can't do anything about those who would rather be uninformed\/misinformed.\n  ","351853":"\n  I have very long posts of wisdom, but they are situational and it would be strange to use them here.\n  ","351854":"\n  Being possessive.\n  ","351855":"\n  They all taste bad.\n  ","351856":"\n  All the misfortune.\n  ","351857":"\n  Tiresome.\n  ","351858":"\n  Are people not allowed to smile without some sort of implication behind it?\n  ","351859":"\n  The smell of dry erase markers. \"Low odor\" my ass.

You know.\n  ","351864":"\n  I've never liked dogs; they are much too high maintenance and obnoxious for my taste. My sister found two abandoned kittens and brought them home, but my parents never bought any kittens for us, no. But I am a big fan of kittens, and anything small, really.\n  ","351865":"\n  Hm, I always know what they want, generally.\n  ","351866":"\n  I have too many favorite songs, and we are still living in the 2000s.\n  ","351867":"\n  No, I have a cup every night, and I generally drink half of a water bottle every day. I live off of juices, but I do not drink much in general, hence why my blood pressure is typically on the low side.\n  ","351868":"\n  Thanks, man.\n  ","351869":"\n  No, my memory's shit.\n  ","351870":"\n  Emotions are not a choice, but you can choose your mindset. Mindset\/perceptions -> Feelings -> Behavior\/actions.\n  ","351871":"\n  If you cannot say it directly, it's best to drop hints. But remember that they cannot read your mind and some people cannot understand hints.\n  ","351872":"\n  Why should an ambition be secret?\n  ","351873":"\n  Favorite is enamored because I like how it sounds and what it represents. I'm not sure what my least favorite would be. Hamstrings or something.\n  ","351874":"\n  My birthday is months from now.\n  ","351875":"\n  Depends on the setting.
