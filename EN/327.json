you ? and how did they change you ?"},"Answer":{"302475":"i have the tendency to be spiteful when it comes to certain people in my life , but i ve been trying to quell those tendencies because they re toxic and unhealthy and don t serve me at all .","302476":"the only expensive thing i ve ever found on the ground was a bill , lol . i was a teenager , so naturally it seemed like a lot of money back then .","302477":"it s starting to be that way again , lol . i ve been getting at least one coffee related question per day lately .","302478":"social media is both brilliant and toxic , depending on how you use it and who you choose to follow . on the one hand , social media can be a great educational tool and it s amazing how fast news travels via social media . there s really no reason for people not to be abreast of developments in current events . however , at the same time , it can be problematic if you associate yourself or follow the wrong crowd , and herd mentality definitely has the tendency to develop over time . on askfm especially , there has always been this pressure to believe in certain things act certain ways in order to fit in with the crowd you re following to vie for their attention , and sometimes people feed off of each other too much to the point where it can be unhealthy .","302479":"i only own the sweet peach palette the pumpkin spice palette , but the pumpkin spice palette is amazing . the colors are so rich , and i m looking forward to experimenting more with it . i ve only used it once when i had to get dressed up for my job s holiday party last month , but i got compliments on my eye makeup when i went .","302480":"i m proud of my boyfriend , as well as my best friend . they ve both overcome outstanding odds to be the people they are today , and they ve never let their hardships , struggles or medical conditions get in the way of their aspirations .","302481":"too faced is my favorite cosmetics brand , and i have a lot of their products , including eye shadow palettes , setting spray , foundation and concealer , and mascara .","302482":"no , there are better selfies where you can see my hair color more clearly . i think i like it so much because you can see my cheekbones jawline really well , and my undercut only makes my cheekbones seem that much more prominent .","302483":"i had a oz cup of hot coffee this morning , but i didn t finished it because i ended up taking a nap . then i made a glass of iced coffee , so i m not sure how many ounces that was . i m now drinking a third cup of coffee , also iced .","302484":"i used to play gta v a lot with my friends , but we haven t played it together in quite a while .","302485":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302486":"i just lay down , close my eyes , and fall asleep . i can sleep pretty much at any time , so it s never been an issue for me .","302487":"no , i m fairly easy going when it comes to most things . i only get angry when something is my fault , at which point i obviously get angry at myself , and i m pretty forgiving or indifferent when it comes to most other people .","302488":"quite the opposite actually . stay at home mothers have to watch about the child ren as well as probably do most of the housework and cooking , which is a lot of work around the clock . they re definitely the furthest thing from being lazy unless they re not properly taking care of their children or abandoning household chores .","302489":"it s definitely been a lazy saturday . i ended up sleeping most of the day tbh . i took two naps , and in between those naps , i played video games . that s literally all i did .","302490":"skyrim , fallout , destiny , assassin s creed syndicate , the bioshock series , tomb raider , life is strange , the wolf among us , and fallout .","302491":"no , i can t remember the last time i weighed myself .","302492":"surprisingly , i m most productive on mondays . i notice that after i m off for the weekend , i go back into work with a fresh state of mind and i m more motivated to complete assignments because i don t feel as burnt out as i usually do the rest of the week .","302493":"blue calm , collected , and pensive . i m thinking about what i want to do today , but i m also content with just staying home and catching up on video games laundry all day .","302494":"i ve been to plenty of concerts ! ! most recently , i attended alt . s not so silent night at the barclays center in brooklyn , and the performers were ajr , bastille , mike shinoda , chvrches , florence and the machine , death cab for cutie , and muse among others . last summer , i also saw macklemore and kesha . in the years before that , i ve also seen alice in chains , stone temple pilots , linkin park , chris cornell , korn , and a few other rock bands .","302495":"even though this selfie is like a year old at this point , i still love it and i ll use it as a profile picture every now and again .","302496":"i ve never moved across the country , no . i ve moved from new york to massachusetts when i first went to college , but that was the extent of my travels .","302497":"lol , this defines my life . i become obsessed with most games i play , and lately , i ve been obsessed with fallout . it s definitely not as terrible of a game as critics are making it out to be , and i m thoroughly enjoying the gameplay and quests and enemies . it s a lot more challenging than the previous games . before i started playing fallout , i was obsessed with fallout and skyrim .","302498":"people are swayed by both to a degree , but i believe that business advertisements have the ability to sway people more , simply because society in general pays more attention to the media and advertisements than they do politicians .","302499":"even though i was never a fan of physical education , i still think it s important to keep those classes in schools just for the sake of giving children a reason to run around and play sports for minutes . everyone needs to be physically active , minus those with physical disabilities and such , and it s healthy to implement physical education in order to keep kids active .","302500":"it is and it isn t , which sounds confusing . half of the population in my area are black people and latinos , while there are also still older white people from the earlier generations who still live here . i ve noticed that the older white folk are extremely racist , but that s the only demographic that pretty much is .","302501":"i don t personally think so , no . i can barely tolerate my own life sometimes i still have a lot of issues with my mental health , so i don t think i would be qualified to be a life coach when i can t even get my own life together .","302502":"no , i don t believe i was happier four months ago . tbh i don t really remember what was going on in my life four months ago , but i do know that i ve been approaching with a fresh mindset and new motivation .","302503":"i just read briefly about the yellow vest protests , yeah . i didn t hear about that before this very moment .","302504":"it depends entirely on how i m feeling that day , tbh . some days i have more tolerance than others . most of the time , i think i d say that i don t get fed up easily because i do have a lot of patience , but there are other times where my patience is at zero .","302505":"you re asking the completely wrong person , my dude . lmao . i haven t flirted with anyone besides my boyfriend in basically ten years .","302506":"no , you re mostly incorrect . some people have the tendency to dwell on their first loves because they believe that they were the best love , but a lot of people seem to have the opposite thought . my first love certainly wasn t my best love , and i ve learned a lot about relationships since then . the first love is generally one of the greatest learning experiences .","302507":"i ve been smoking cigarettes since i was years old . there was a time where i quit for about a year , but then i picked up the habit again when i got a job in retail .","302508":"my family used to have a dog german shepard mix for many years before she passed away when i was around the age of . since then , i ve kept fish two betta fish and a corycat .","302509":"i ve been in love twice before . the first time ended up in massive heartbreak , but i ve been in love with my current boyfriend for many years now .","302510":"sushi is my favorite food . it s so versatile , and i m never in a mood where i don t want sushi .","302511":"pretty much any show i watch is binge watched , lol . i m currently binge watching you on netflix which is really good , btw , but in the past , i binge watched women behind bars , wentworth , orange is the new black , parks and rec , how i met your mother , friends , etc etc .","302512":"no , i ve never smoked meth before .","302513":"yes , i ve smoked weed before .","302514":"pretty much any song by hobo johnson .","302515":"the only person i feel comfortable sleeping next to is my boyfriend .","302516":"i ve made a few friends on askfm , but it wasn t the reason why i joined the site years ago . i was also talking about irl in my previous answer , not my online activities .","302517":"no , i don t make friends easily because i m never in a position where there s an opportunity to make friends . i m fine with that , though . i only have a few friends and i m content with the people i talk to on a regular basis .","302518":"if someone tries to start something with me , then i ll inform them that i m not involving myself in their drama unless they can sit down and talk civil like an adult .","302519":"light beer ipas . i generally enjoy most beer except stouts .","302520":"i m referring to real life .","302521":"it s physically and emotionally draining , and i d rather not waste my time arguing with people who are probably better off not being in my life .","302522":"i could go for a beer right about now .","302523":"no , i generally avoid confrontation .","302524":"idk , i ve been fascinated with them since i was a child . it isn t something that erupted for a concise reason , it s just always been there .","302525":"i m guessing they re your coworkers or classmates or something ? ? tbh i would just try again . make it clear to them that you won t put up with what they re saying about you , even if they re allegedly joking . if that makes you a sensitive person , then so be it . you need to do what you have to do to feel comfortable in your space , especially considering you see these people every day .","302526":"depends on what subtype of feminism you re talking about . white feminism is absolutely horrid and has done worse things for women in general , and as a result of the new wave feminism movement , many people simply don t take feminism seriously anymore since its viewed these days as a trend . intersectional feminism is great in theory , but again it s become a trend , which is terrible considering people have been spreading misinformation regarding intersectional feminism ever since it got on the popular radar . feminism used to be so radical , revolutionary , and good for implementing change in the past , i . e . the s s . but these days , not so much . people are more apt to sit behind their keyboard and spew misinformation as opposed to being proactive with their activism and trying to advocate on behalf of women .","302527":"i would probably tell them that they were hurting my feelings , even though they claim that they were just joking . sometimes people can be sensitive to certain things even in jest , so i would be up front with them about it and make it clear that it makes you uncomfortable when they joke about things about you .","302528":"no , i only need to wash my hair times per week .","302529":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry ! ! thanks for the follow , though","302530":"no , although i ve never actually tried before . however , i have no sense of balance so i can t imagine that working out well for me .","302531":"my day went well . tech support ended up upgrading the software in everyone s computers this afternoon , so i had a nice break while waiting for the upgrade to finish , lol . i don t have plans for this weekend , but i might go out with a friend tonight .","302532":"i have quite a few bad memories , sure .","302533":"prior to my current job , i worked in retail and at a law firm .","302534":"i watched drake josh , but i don t recall watching zoey .","302535":"even when i was a teenager , i didn t really like any of the shows that were on disney or nickelodeon , lol . i mainly watched adult swim those days .","302536":"no . the last time i watched either of those channels was when i was in high school .","302537":"no , it doesn t interfere with my sleep at all actually . i suppose my body has just gotten used to it over time , since i ve been drinking coffee at night for quite a while now .","302538":"if they do , they thankfully don t give any indication that they do .","302539":"i m drinking coffee , listening to music , and answering questions on askfm my nightly ritual , it seems .","302540":"i usually don t come into contact with men who are flirtatious , lol .","302541":"i suppose it depends on her intentions . is she flirting with you because she likes you , or are her actions done unconsciously because it s simply part of who she is ? ? some people are just naturally flirty and they have no real motive behind how they re acting , it s simply just the way they are .","302542":"much like what everyone else in response to this question , it can go either way . there isn t a proper way to say such a thing , it s just whatever you prefer .","302543":"i already track the time it takes for me to complete activities at work , and it s a bit of a source of inspiration for me to work more quickly and efficiently . i have to fill out a timesheet every day of the work i completed each hour , so it s a good challenge for me to see how much i can do in one day and compare it to previous days .","302544":"i really can t think of any job where you aren t obligated to keep some sort of calendar . even with freelance jobs , you have deadlines to keep in mind even if you aren t necessarily commuting to an office every day , and deadlines are calendar dates in themselves .","302545":"i ll try to answer your question , sure . but i can t necessarily guarantee that i ll have a good answer .","302546":"i wouldn t take myself anywhere because it s dangerous in my area to go to most places alone unless it s somewhere like the grocery store or pharmacy .","302547":"sushi ! ! i literally cannot think of a time when i don t want sushi , lol . my favorite is the spicy tuna roll , but i also love salmon avocado rolls and veggie tempura rolls .","302548":"i don t post full body photos on askfm , so this assumption is unfounded . there s also nothing inherently wrong with being called fat , especially if i m the person calling myself fat . it s something i m attempting to change , and the first step to changing it is acknowledging that i have excessive body weight .","302549":"my boyfriend . i could function if i lost all of my friends , but i would be at a complete loss if my boyfriend left or passed away . it s something i can t even fathom experiencing .","302550":"meeeee .","302551":"yes , i believe that people can change out of love . when you re truly in love with someone and that feeling is reciprocated , then you can be inspired to change your bad toxic behaviors and habits in an effort to make yourself a better individual . we re constantly evolving as humans as it is , and experiencing love can be the fuel that triggers change .","302552":"i think they have a grave misunderstanding of the services that planned parenthood actually provides , ranging from birth control and std sti testing to things such as pap smears , cancer screenings , hormone therapy and infertility treatment . if someone believes that a medical service shouldn t be funded when a large majority of their services include the aforementioned things , then i can only assume that individual doesn t want people with uteruses to obtain proper medical care .","302553":"this morning i was disappointed that i only purchased a oz hot coffee instead of a oz hot coffee . i managed to drink the entire cup in maybe minutes in between working on assignments .","302554":"yeah , when it s warranted at least . i m not mean unless someone has said something that deserves a mean reply . i m not mean for absolutely no reason .","302555":"yeah , i ve kissed girls before .","302556":"i love mai tais , blue hawaiians , and espresso martinis .","302557":"yeah , i smoke occasionally .","302558":"mixing alcohol with energy drinks is dangerous , imo . that s why i stopped drinking red bull vodkas , even though i enjoyed them . they re just too dangerous . you can mix malibu with almost anything , though . pineapple juice , cranberry juice , orange juice , etc etc .","302559":"i don t remember the last thing i legitimately broke , because it s been quite a while since i ve been that angry , but i almost broke my xbox controller a few months ago when my fallout game ended up freezing crashing , and i lost everything i did within the last hour .","302560":"i have quite a few ! ! brave , maleficent , moana , treasure planet , the emperor s new groove , tarzan , mulan , and the nightmare before christmas .","302561":"overdose by grandson https www . youtube . com watch ? v qswf kggnii","302562":"lol , no . i m not a furry .","302563":"i already told you that i don t give out my facebook . this will be the last time i m repeating that statement .","302564":"my most recent purchase was the money i spent on my therapy session this evening , lmao . other than that , i also purchased a medium sized americano at lunch today while i was at work .","302565":"no , i don t think i m more mature than other people my age . i d say that my maturity level equals out to the same as other people in my age bracket i . e . years old . age can define one s maturity to a degree , but it can also be based on life experiences and the idea that a person may have been forced to grow up at a younger age than some of their peers . when i was younger , i would have said that i was more mature than my peers because i didn t have a genuine childhood , but these days , i would say i m more or less the same maturity as everyone else .","302566":"like . . . so many questions can be answered if someone reads my bio , lmao . i don t understand why people don t look at bios when they re on someone else s page .","302567":"i don t give out my facebook .","302568":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","302569":"if you re asking me what my job is , then i m a writer editor for a publishing company .","302570":"as my bio indicates , i m from new york .","302571":"if you re an athiest , it believes you don t believe in any form of god , and most atheists either aren t religious at all or completely reject the idea of religion . i m an athiest , personally . however , i do understand that religion often helps people so i don t reject religion entirely . i ve just never been a religious person i don t believe in god .","302572":"hello i m doing well . i m just eating dinner now then i m debating on watching netflix or playing video games .","302573":"i reorganized the shelf above my bed last week it looks so pretty .","302574":"it depends on the day . usually i only drink a large coffee in the morning whether it s dunkin or starbucks then two oz cups of coffee at night when i get home from work .","302575":"both of my facebook instagram accounts are private .","302576":"well , you must be new to my page . i ll spell it out clearly for you i m not a baby nor will i post photos of myself in a bikini , if i even had those to begin with .","302577":"today , i learned not to smoke a hybrid strain of marijuana right before bed because , if you re anything like me , you ll wake up later than your alarm and still not want to move out of bed despite the fact that you ll be late for work , lmao .","302578":"i don t watch anime , but i do love studio ghibli films , i . e . kiki s delivery service , spirited away , and howl s moving castle .","302579":"yes , i ve had three serious relationships . they re pretty much the only relationships i ve ever been in as well .","302580":"i would choose to feel no fear . anxiety and fear go hand in hand , and if i were to quell my fears , then i would likely quell any anxiety that i experience on a regular basis , such as when i m driving or talking to people .","302581":"i would tell my younger self that what they re feeling is completely valid , and that they re not losing their mind . what happened to them was real and unforgiving , and it s going to take years upon years to come to terms with it , but they re going to survive and make a life worth living .","302582":"it depends on a variety of things , i . e . who s talking to me , the mood i m in , how exhausted i am , etc etc . for the most part , i am an active listener , but sometimes i do drift off and realize that i stopped listening at which point , i have to ask the person to repeat themselves , lol . thankfully it s never happened in any dire situations , such as at work , but it definitely happened when i was in lecture at college a few times .","302583":"my favorite sin to indulge in has gotta be sloth , lol . i truly value my sleep and my lazy days more than most other things , and sometimes all i want is just a day to sleep in and lay in bed all day long .","302584":"no , i think that s a false stereotype . technology has advanced so much in the past decade or so that it s only enhanced our abilities to complete tasks in a more efficient manner . in addition , it s also much easier to obtain information regarding virtually anything you want to learn about . if anything , technology has made humanity more proactive .","302585":"i don t generally think about people who are like that overall . if someone thinks they re better than they actually are , in that they believe they re a good or righteous person when they re anything but , then i believe they probably need a reality check .","302586":"we must be thinking about different crazy frogs then . the one i m talking about debuted in and was basically a cgi character that voiced over different edm and dance songs .","302587":"lol , no . it s only ounces . i made it at home , i didn t purchase it .","302588":"i haven t heard of crazy frog in years , my dude . talk about a blast from the past .","302589":"i prefer headphones . earbuds always fall out of my ears and i can still hear noise around me with them in . headphones allow for a more immersive experience .","302590":"nothing much has gone on today really . i woke up with my boyfriend this morning he actually woke up with me instead of sleeping in , aw , and then i went to work . after work , i attended my therapy appointment , and then i went home . i ve just been sipping on a cup of coffee , listening to music , and answering questions since i ve been home . i m probably going to eat dinner soon , and then later tonight , my boyfriend and i have an xbox date with fallout .","302591":"i didn t have a topic that i dreaded writing about . i loved writing about nearly anything i could get my hands on , because not only was it easy for me to express my opinions and understanding of the material , but writing about the material also gave me a more in depth perspective of what i was learning .","302592":"i broke up with my ex because he ended up lying to me , was keeping things from me , and was generally acting really shady . i later found out he cheated on me , so it was for the best .","302593":"a more in depth reporting blocking system would really do askfm wonders . often people who are undeserving of being reported or banned get reported banned , and those who are complete nuisances and break every single rule guideline somehow can still make accounts . i think askfm should implement an ip ban .","302594":"apparently i m good at interviews , considering i ve been offered a job with every interview i ve gone on before ! ! i suppose i do a good job at suppressing my emotions and anxiety when i go on job interviews , because normally i m panicking but i ve never been told that i looked anxious .","302595":"unfortunately , i ve never been able to lucid dream before . i ve always wanted to , but my dreams are absolutely wild and i always believe they re real . it takes me a few minutes to understand reality when i wake up in the morning .","302596":"i will be driving a car at pm , so that s likely not the best idea .","302597":"nails scraping on chalkboards . the squeak of slippery fruit against clean teeth . people chewing with their mouth open .","302598":"i used to worry about that in the past , but these days , not so much . if someone dislikes me , it s likely because they simply don t know me , and i would rather not get to know a person if they base their opinions of someone off of what they ve been told by someone else . that s essentially herd mentality .","302599":"lol , yes . when i was a teenager , i was convinced i was going to be this renowned , terrific writer . . . it wasn t until i entered college that i realized that it was going to be a hell of a lot of work , and although i still have dreams of being a great writer , they re somewhat distant dreams at this point .","302600":"if you re going through hell , keep going . it s always been a source of inspiration for me , that no matter how far down you ve gone , you can always crawl out of the hole and build yourself back up again .","302601":"eggs have a very distinct odor , i ve come to notice . it can be both a good and bad thing , because sometimes they smell really good and other times it smells absolutely horrid to me .","302602":"i passed my driving test on my second attempt . i failed my first attempt because i got nervous and couldn t parallel park correctly .","302603":"yes , on multiple occasions , unfortunately . they would act as if my feelings didn t matter that their feelings were the most important thing for me to account for , even if i didn t necessarily do anything wrong .","302604":"friendship . i don t become friends with people easily , but when i do , they re long lasting friendships . i ve been friends with my best friend for years , and my other closest friend besides her , i ve been friends with her for years .","302605":"yes , i ve been driving since i was years old .","302606":"the last thing i did before i went to bed last night was cuddle with my boyfriend . that was the last thing i remember before falling asleep .","302607":"just stop talking to them . if there s a person i dislike in my life then i have no issue in removing that person , whether it s by simply not talking to them anymore or deleting them off of social media .","302608":"does my therapy appointment count ? ? lmao . if not , then i bought an americano this afternoon after lunch .","302609":"yes , definitely . pubs are just standard bars that maybe have a jukebox or a billiards table , but they re mostly just a bar with different seating inside . i always go to pubs , never again will i go to a club .","302610":"no , i ve never texted an ex partner or an ex friend after we drifted apart . i have no desire to talk to anyone like that anymore .","302611":"pubs , definitely . i ve only ever been to an actual club twice , and the first time i went , i ended up having a panic attack and spent the evening outside in the rain because i was trying to calm myself down .","302612":"i just got home from therapy , so now i m going to make a cup of coffee and relax for a while .","302613":"no , i m in a relationship .","302614":"hello it s the evening where i live . do you have a question ? ?","302615":"i don t know whether or not i want children in the future . i m very torn on the subject .","302616":"not really , no . i only ever feel nauseous when i have too much dairy , which is part of the reason why i ve been limiting my diary intake lately .","302617":"i don t pay rent at my parents house , but i do contribute to grocery shopping and i do all of the cleaning in the house .","302618":"no , i have just enough money to be comfortable at the moment . i m eyeing a potential raise in my future , though .","302619":"both are cute , but i love my boyfriend s dimples so much .","302620":"lol , i go to dive bars but that s basically it . there are really only maybe three places i frequent but they re all relatively quiet on the weekdays , which is why i go there .","302621":"mostly open world rpgs and fps games . i ve been playing fallout a lot lately , but i also enjoy fallout and skyrim , destiny and , the assassin s creed games , the tomb raider games , the bioshock series , life is strange , the wolf among us , minecraft , etc etc .","302622":"i d politely decline . i m not single , but even if i was , i probably wouldn t be down to giving some random stranger my phone number or social media handle .","302623":"i don t remember . i m sure i saw at least one when i was much younger , but i can t really remember that far back into the past .","302624":"god forbid i answer the questions people ask me , lol . if you have an issue with how many coins i have , then perhaps stop asking me questions .","302625":"no , i don t like playing cod . however , i ve watched courrtana stream it a few times ! !","302626":"i don t remember my childhood , so i honestly have no idea .","302627":"i ve been at work all day , my dude .","302628":"no , i ve never watched death note before .","302629":"coins .","302630":"i m not in panic mode like i was yesterday , but i m still somewhat under the weather and completely exhausted .","302631":"i thought about it , but i can t justify spending that kind of money rn . i ve also never taken an online class before so idk if i would like it .","302632":"yeah , but nothing compares to going to a lecture with a knowledgable professor and sitting there taking notes and learning new things for minutes with no interruption .","302633":"no problem ! ! also i just realized that its called everpure , not everstrong . i think everstrong is for the thickening shampoo and everpure is for color treated hair . it s a red pink bottle .","302634":"education . i feel like my intelligence has gone stagnant because i haven t been in college for five years , and sometimes i wish i could enroll in school again and learn things every day like i used to .","302635":"i don t need positive reinforcement , but i do enjoy it when it comes from certain people my boyfriend , close friends , and my boss . sometimes it s nice to feel validated and know that you re doing a good job .","302636":"lol , i ve never threatened to beat someone up . but i have been forced to be tough with people to the point where i would simply insult them if they were rude to me first and wouldn t listen to reason .","302637":"ruffles cheddar and sour cream .","302638":"i don t watch the same video over and over again . however , i watch achievement hunter s content the most so i m sure there are some videos i ve seen multiple times . i also used to love when seananners was active on youtube . i ll watch his old videos again occasionally .","302639":"i would go back to school and study either psychology or sociology . when i was in college , i debated on changing my major to sociology because i enjoyed the subject so much . as for which college , i really have no idea . probably somewhere like brown university or columbia university .","302640":"yeah , i use snapchat . i don t usually get streaks because i don t send people snaps every day , and i don t add things to my story either .","302641":"ideally i would like to be a freelance writer , but those jobs often don t pay the bills . i m content where i am rn . it s within the field i went to college for , so i have no complaints .","302642":"a call center representative or a sales representative . basically any job where i have to talk to people for a living . i have social anxiety and i absolutely hate talking on the phone except obviously when it s my boyfriend . i m used to being around customers since i worked retail for years , but it made me so nervous and anxious .","302643":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company .","302644":"i ve been on askfm since maybe or so . i remember answering questions when i was in college . right now , i have followers . however , i ve had three accounts since and i only made this account maybe almost two years ago .","302645":"i received my driver s license when i was years old . i think i failed the first time i took my driving test , but i passed the second time .","302646":"yes , lmao . the most random and obscure things make me cry .","302647":"my day has been fine a lot better than yesterday , at least . i had motivation to finish my work and i stopped by to pick up coffee and cigarettes , so i m pretty content rn . i m eating dinner and then i m going to head to my boyfriend s house since i haven t seen him in a few days .","302648":"lol , no . the only times i m a looter a thief is when i m playing video games .","302649":"ahh thank you ! ! i use the l oreal everstrong sulfate free shampoo conditioner . the one that smells like rosemary and mint .","302650":"yeah , it helps a lot when i have congestion or a cold flu .","302651":"why ? ? and why is he a poor man if his spouse had a nose she was previously unhappy with ? ? y all place too much importance on physical appearances .","302652":"the fireman by joe hill i am not a serial killer by dan wells .","302653":"my back pain has been tolerable lately , but i still have the urge to stretch and crack it every minutes .","302654":"how would that be lying ? ? lying would be saying you haven t had plastic surgery when you have , lol . i don t really see the big deal in keeping some things to yourself unless it s an issue . i feel like that s one of those topics that would just be brought up casually in conversation .","302655":"not really , no .","302656":"yeah , i have a medication that i take for anxiety that s as needed .","302657":"i think i only read like two books , lol .","302658":"i like moderately spicy food , but nothing too hot .","302659":"it isn t something that happens consciously . it just tends to happen through life experience .","302660":"the woman who was in a coma or something ? ? i heard about it but didn t bother to read any articles on it .","302661":"i went to work , came home , and made a cup of coffee . i m watching netflix now .","302662":"non binary simply means you re not one of the binaries of gender man or woman . your gender is somewhere on the spectrum , but you don t exclusively identify as either a man or a woman .","302663":"you re not obligated to tell them , no . if it s something personal to you and you don t feel comfortable sharing , then it isn t as if you must tell them right away or at all , for that matter .","302664":"overall , yeah there s more activity . i think the original anon meant that it s dead at the moment , which is the same for me rn .","302665":"it happens sometimes .","302666":"anyone have any questions ? ?","302667":"i ve just been drinking coffee and checking up on social media , trying to relax . my anxiety isn t as bad as it was before when i was at work , but it s still there .","302668":"when i m at work , yes . lol . time tends to go by super slow when i m working , unless i m heavily involved in a specific project that i actually enjoy doing .","302669":"no , probably not . like scuba diving , it s never been something that i ve been interested in doing .","302670":"sometimes i am , yeah . it depends entirely on my mood that day , though .","302671":"it isn t really something i ve ever been interested in doing .","302672":"i already said that i have no importance to society , so no .","302673":"step out of your comfort zone do something you ve always wanted to do but were previously afraid . take responsible risks if you know that there s a chance of a better outcome , and even if you fail , be content with the knowledge that at least you tried . scrap the dirt off your knees and try again , or approach it in a different manner .","302674":"people who make a genuine difference in the world , i . e . scientists , professors and teachers , politicians even though most of them don t have positive significance , attorneys , etc etc .","302675":"it s a pretty self evident statement . i m not important means that i m not of any significance to society .","302676":"my opinion of someone would change if i found out that they supported something that i was vehemently against , especially in cases where they don t support lgbtq rights , women s rights , people of color , etc etc . if a found out that a friend of mine was racist or sexist or whatever , then i would probably stop being friends with them .","302677":"it isn t worth it to be afraid when what you have to do will change you or your situation for the better . it s justified to be afraid of big changes and there s nothing wrong with it in fact , it s expected in most cases , but it isn t worth holding yourself back in fear . you ll be better off in the long run .","302678":"i m spontaneous , especially since i don t know how i m going to feel about a plan in the future . i tend to ask friends if they want to hang out a few hours before actually hanging out , if they happen to be available that night .","302679":"i treated myself to an iced coffee when i got home from work because it makes me feel better when i have a bad day .","302680":"i don t have a position in society and i m not important , so this question doesn t exactly apply to me .","302681":"not everyone , no . most people do , though .","302682":"the mind is different from the body , in my perspective at least . however , the mind can have effects on the body i . e . , my anxiety causes me a lot of digestive problems , and then there are the obvious physical symptoms of anxiety attacks and panic attacks .","302683":"i would ask them how much money and when could they pay me back .","302684":"my anxiety has been acting up again for some reason . i don t know if it s because there are some stressors in my life these days or because i need a stronger dose of anti anxiety medication , though . i ve been on the same dosage for a while , and it wouldn t surprise me if my body simply got used to it .","302685":"i ve started eating healthier again , i . e . more vegetables instead of carbs , fish instead of red meat , and less dairy .","302686":"when everything seems to be going wrong , i try to rationalize it to myself by saying that at least the only thing that can happen now is for things to get better . when you re at rock bottom , the only way you can go is up .","302687":"my bedroom or my boyfriend s house . whenever i go over his house , it feels like a small vacation because i m away from my family and i m free to do whatever i want to do . even though my bedroom is somewhat of an escape for me as well , i m constantly being interrupted .","302688":"lately , my fish tank is not being used . ever since my fish died , i haven t decided on whether or not i want to have more fish , so i ve just been maintaining the tank until i make a decision .","302689":"i agree . they had a follow up question , but i deleted it .","302690":"probably a combination of the stress associated with the new material i m learning at work , my exhaustion because i didn t sleep well last night , and my mind racing because that s generally how my brain behaves . sometimes there isn t necessarily a reason behind anxiety either . i often have bouts of anxiety with no real reason behind it at all .","302691":"i used to be extremely creative in that i would always be drawing , painting , writing , doing photography , etc etc . these days , i haven t had the time or motivation to really delve into those hobbies , although i have been trying to write every day .","302692":"hopeful for the future , mainly . i don t hold quite a pessimistic outlook on myself or my future , whereas when i feel hopeless , i feel as if there s no point in anything i m doing , my future is bleak , and that i don t deserve to live .","302693":"yeah , i ve tasted blood before .","302694":"no , my day was difficult and aggravating . my anxiety started acting up after lunch , and i didn t have any of my anti anxiety pills on me , so i couldn t focus on my work and i started getting extremely overwhelmed . i ended up leaving an hour early because i felt awful .","302695":"i used to watch toonami on adult swim when i was much younger , but that was pretty much it .","302696":"my family members severely alter my mood and can really ruin my day if something happens or someone berates or yells at me , especially if it s through text message in the middle of the day when i m not even home . it happens at least twice a month , unfortunately .","302697":"when my life is going okay , my mental health is a lot better . i don t experience much anxiety and my depression doesn t flare up as often . i find myself feeling motivated and hopeful as opposed to hopeless and exhausted .","302698":"not really , no . sometimes my mind is too active it makes me paranoid , but i do sleep better in the darkness .","302699":"i drink way too much coffee , it s probably pretty unhealthy .","302700":"i m the same person that i am when people are watching , although perhaps a bit more sloppy and lazy . i see no reason to put on a facade in front of other people , it seems exhausting .","302701":"lol , i believe i did .","302702":"somewhat , yeah . sometimes it s difficult for me to find motivation in the morning , but eventually i get back into the routine .","302703":"no , i don t watch anime .","302704":"nah , not everything . i tell him about what i do at work sometimes , but i don t bother telling him my conversations with my coworkers or anything like that . i don t tell him about most things regarding askfm either . occasionally , i ll tell him about a funny interaction or ask his opinion on a question if it makes me think , but that s it .","302705":"i ve always been more of a book person . in most cases , i prefer the book over the movie especially since movie adaptations of books often leave out crucial information or alter timelines .","302706":"i try to do at least one small thing for myself every day , whether that s simply sitting down with a cup of coffee quietly listening to music in order to relax , or treating myself to one of my favorite treats .","302707":"it depends entirely on the individual . it s difficult to really class people based on sex because everyone s personalities are so different . i think my friend clint is pretty equal in regards to males versus females .","302708":"my physical appearance , mostly . i would also enjoy if i didn t take what people in my life say closely to heart , because often i can act irrationally in response to things and think too deeply into what they might mean .","302709":"you re under no obligation to tell your partner every single , little thing going on in your life . while that works for some people , it definitely doesn t work for everyone i can understand some people wanting to keep certain things to themselves that not even their partner knows about .","302710":"i have plenty of hobbies , lol . god forbid i feel like answering questions on askfm when i m home from work .","302711":"thank you , anon ! !","302712":"obviously not considering i ve been answering questions non stop for nearly three hours straight .","302713":"i don t remember . this is going back to when i was like years old .","302714":"yes ! ! that pretty much defined my early internet days i would talk to people on message boards and wouldn t know what they looked like until years later when we all migrated to another social media site , i . e . myspace or facebook .","302715":"one all time favorite song ? ? no . however , i ve been listening to hallucinogenics by matt maeson nonstop , so i suppose that s my current favorite song .","302716":"it s been fairly low these days tbh .","302717":"the only people s attention i truly value are the attentions of my boyfriend and close friends . i don t really care for the attention of anyone else , and quite frankly , sometimes it does irritate me if someone is trying to get my attention and i don t care for them .","302718":"i have no complaints at the moment , which is a nice change from the usual . i ve had a lot more motivation these days compared to the past few years , and i actually have a semi positive outlook for the future . there are some things i wish i could change , but right now , they re mostly out of my control so the only thing i can really do is ride it out and take each day as it comes .","302719":"i prefer rustic or industrial styled homes a lot of wood , piping , brown and mahogany colors , etc etc . i also love big bay windows and natural lighting , as well as skylights , and fireplaces .","302720":"i don t remember what it was that i was laughing about , but it happened last night . lmao . i just remember laughing to the point where it made my abdomen hurt tears were welling up in my eyes .","302721":"it personally makes no difference to me , but considering my boyfriend is a handyman , that s essentially his lifelong dream . he always discusses what sorts of rooms he wants , what he wants in those rooms , blueprints for the house , where he ll put his fish tanks and lizard tanks , etc etc . because of that , i ve always envisioned us buying an old home and basically reworking it little by little .","302722":"check up on social media , i . e . instagram , askfm , and twitter usually . if nothing is going on there , then i ll usually put netflix on and watch something in the meantime . i also play video games when i m bored too .","302723":"my page is fairly active , yes . i always wake up to at least questions , and i get a few here there throughout the day as well . this evening has actually been incredibly active , for some weird reason .","302724":"i used to a lot in the past , but not so much anymore . i never respond to anon hate , so i assume that whoever used to send it to me just got tired of getting no response out of me , so they stopped .","302725":"no , i have no reason to disable anonymous questions . if i did , then my inbox would be bone dry all the time , lol .","302726":"no , i try not to be rude in general . the only times i m rude are when someone is rude to me first and their behavior or statements warrants a rude response .","302727":"indecisive , emotionally unstable , and passionate .","302728":"i use an nyx highlight contour palette , which is really high quality considering the price of the palette itself . nyx is overall a great brand for cheap prices , so i highly suggest them if you want good quality cosmetics for affordable prices .","302729":"continue going to my therapy sessions , where i develop a deeper understanding of my behaviors and actively work toward eradicating harmful coping mechanisms and replacing them with healthier , more productive ones . medication can only do so much in regards to my depression and anxiety , but the real changes come through what has been psychologically ingrained in me from a young age . i have to actively work toward breaking bad habits and creating new ones .","302730":"a bearded dragon ! ! can you imagine the adorable pitter patter of their feet on the ground ? ? lol . omg , i would die .","302731":"if i have , then i don t recall doing it .","302732":"no , i ve never seen the point in that . if i needed to talk to someone about something if i thought that they were misguided or misinformed , then i would simply message them privately .","302733":"it s not as if he sends them to anyone else , so it doesn t bother me . i ve made a few memes out of courrtana too , lol .","302734":"going out and running errands is the biggest thing . my driving anxiety deters me from going out during the day when everyone else is out , so i never go out on the weekends even though i have nothing else to do then . like , i ve been meaning to go to the store and buy a bunch of things but the only times i can go are when everyone else is on the road so it s different for me to get myself out there when the only thing i can think about is potentially getting into an accident .","302735":"i don t have any saved , but he would screenshot my ugly snapchats and make memes out of them , lmao .","302736":"i promise to work towards bettering my mental health even more than i did last year , journal more often , read more often , and try not to allow my anxiety to hold me back from doing things i either want or need to do .","302737":"my boyfriend has already made me into a meme on countless occasions , lmao .","302738":"ugh , that s a terrible environment to be in . i m not close with her like that so we never talked about it , so i m honestly not sure . either way you should do what you want to do that makes you happy . there s also a famous internet celebrity named caiti ward from rooster teeth who got braces in her s , and she s very open about it online . i m sure you can find some posts where she talks about her experiences ! !","302739":"exercising counting calories .","302740":"there s definitely not an age limit for wearing braces ! ! one of my friends who s years old just got her braces taken off after wearing them for years . she shared your anxiety when she was about to get them because of the whole age thing , but the truth is , if it s something you either want or need to do , then it shouldn t matter how old you are . she became so much more confident in herself throughout the process , and eventually the fear and anxiety wore off . i m sure the same will happen to you .","302741":"i tend to notice facial features more often high cheekbones , jutting jawlines , sharp brow bones , piercing eyes , etc etc . i also tend to notice a person s hair first foremost , the way it s colored and styled .","302742":"i think it s silly , considering askfm isn t a dating website . they would probably have better luck on tinder , grindr , plentyoffish , okcupid , match , etc etc . there are a lot of different options out there for people who desire a relationship , and i never understood why some people would choose askfm when it isn t even remotely close to a dating site .","302743":"i don t have an opinion , considering i ve never watched bird box before . it sounds compelling , but i just haven t gotten around to watching it yet .","302744":"no , i was just exhausted . in high school , i barely ever slept throughout the night and sometimes i wouldn t sleep at all at night .","302745":"i don t pay attention to what celebrities endorse or believe , unless it s so compelling that it makes national headlines or something . i prefer to just do my own research and make conclusions based on what i ve read experienced .","302746":"lol , i ve accidentally fallen asleep in class when i was in high school , but never at work or while i was in college .","302747":"uh , i m wearing clothes right now , if that s what you mean . . . lmao . i m wearing sweatpants the hoodie i wore to work today .","302748":"i ve heard of the third eye before , but i m not well versed in its definition or spiritual meaning .","302749":"i wasn t having fun , i just had a lot of work to catch up on . i didn t have the spare time to check the clock since i was too busy working on assignments and editing features .","302750":"yeah , there s still so much discrimination against black trans people in the lgbtq community ! ! lgbtq representation is primarily white washed , i ve noticed , and there isn t adequate representation of trans or non binary individuals in the community either , to the point where there s erasure from cisgender or white folks especially on social media . a lot of people like to preach that they re all for equal rights , etc etc . , but they neglect to bring up the complexities of discrimination that occur against people of color and trans individuals .","302751":"i can fall asleep pretty much anywhere and at any time , so there isn t much i have to do . my only stipulation is that i can t wear socks to bed because they suffocate me .","302752":"to create a life that s worth living up until the moment we perish . we re here on earth for one reason or another and that reason differs with each person , so the best thing we can do in any circumstance is learn to take this life to our advantage and do something that makes it worthwhile .","302753":"of course . people in the lgbtq community are deserving of equal respect and compassion , and just because they re not heterosexual doesn t mean that they re inferior to those who are . people in the lgbtq community have a long history of being oppressed disrespected , and i would certainly hope that in that discrimination will end against them .","302754":"it s not even pm where i live , so it s a bit too early for me to go to bed . i don t usually fall asleep until anywhere between pm to am .","302755":"everyone requires consent . consent is one of the single most important things you can give to a person , and it should be valued a lot higher than it currently is in society .","302756":"that doesn t surprise me in the very least tbh . my initial thought when they first started rolling out the coin feature was that you would be able to exchange coins for exclusive themes , moods , etc etc . however , it would greatly thrill me if you can exchange coins for actual cash via paypal . lmao .","302757":"shelter , lol . yes , rent is expensive on long island , regardless of whether you re looking for a house or an apartment . i haven t checked zillow in a while , but i haven t been able to find a one bedroom one bathroom apartment for less than month .","302758":"i ve feared for my life before , in ways which i would rather not discuss on askfm . i ve also experienced the horrid fear of thinking that my loved ones were dead or in great peril .","302759":"yeah , there are a few people i try to avoid at all costs . sometimes it s nearly impossible , though . i also refrain from talking to people or making eye contact with virtually everyone when i m out running errands to stores as well .","302760":"that only happens to me sometimes usually by the time sunday night rolls around , i m mentally prepared for work again on monday morning . i remember feeling horrible anxious when i worked my last job , though . i always dreaded going into that job , especially on monday mornings because i would have to spend the entire morning catching up on emails and phonecalls from the weekend . i was so stressed out , and it was a nightmare for me .","302761":"yes , i ve pulled all nighters plenty of times they were all when i was between the ages of like and , though , and i haven t needed to pull an all nighter in quite a few years .","302762":"i try to look through google news at least once per day , and i ll read through the headlines and click on articles that either capture my interest or look important enough for me to read .","302763":"i don t exercise as often as i should , but i want to start easing myself back into exercising on a semi regular or regular basis in . i ve been keeping track of my steps each day with my fitbit , at the very least . i usually prefer jogging or speed walking on the treadmill , though .","302764":"i m not too sure i have to see what sort of leftovers are in the fridge rn . i might just heat up some soup because it s easier i m feeling lazy .","302765":"yes , my boyfriend my best friend both know about my askfm account . i talk about askfm with them every now and again .","302766":"my nose is incredibly stuffy i can t breathe out of my right nostril . otherwise , i m feeling fine .","302767":"and apparently i m in the united states . hm , that s pretty interesting . i think it s a cool way for people to find new accounts as well .","302768":"yes , rofl . my favorite cereal is captain crunch .","302769":"oh . i found it ! ! i m out of everyone on my friends list , and you re actually , lol .","302770":"well , i worked wednesday through friday last week , so i didn t really have a real holiday . i only had the previous friday through tuesday off between xmas new years . my day went well , though . i had a hard time waking up in the morning , but once i got to work , i felt absolutely fine . the day went by fairly quickly , so i m hoping the rest of this evening goes by slowly since i don t have much to do tonight .","302771":"lol . oh my god . guaranteed most of my lost lighters are somewhere in my car , lmao . i just bought a really ugly lighter , since i end up losing all of my really cool , brightly colored lighters . so if i lose this one , at least i won t be upset . lol .","302772":"wait , really ? ? i m on the website rn can t find a leaderboard anywhere .","302773":"yeah , we order pizza together occasionally ! ! it only happens on days when we re both home from work , which is rare .","302774":"i just got home from work , and now i m having a cigarette i m going to jump on my laptop to answer some questions considering my inbox is rather full .","302775":"i m usually good about keeping track of where my things are , but i always lose my damn lighters . i just bought a new one , so hopefully i can hold onto it for a while , lmao .","302776":"i m not on any websites where there are leaderboards , as far as i m aware .","302777":"i answer most of the questions i get , as long as they re appropriate questions . i end up deleting perhaps percent of what s sent to me because they re either not questions , trolling , invasive , or inappropriate .","302778":"i answer questions on askfm every day .","302779":"i don t follow upon request , sorry . thanks for the follow , though","302780":"it s ok ! ! i m glad it made you feel better . my situation is that i don t want to be living at home , but i can t afford an apartment .","302781":"it s the unfortunate truth .","302782":"i don t care about what you look like .","302783":"thanks , my dude","302784":"we both live with our parents , and we wouldn t be able to afford a rent payment on top of our respective bills .","302785":"we can t afford it rn , unfortunately .","302786":"not every night , no . tonight , we are though . i m over his house rn .","302787":"sure , if you count the fish bearded dragon that are in my boyfriend s bedroom .","302788":"idk , i haven t weighed myself in months i don t remember how much i weighed when i did .","302789":"no , the singular use of they is grammatically correct as well .","302790":"it s about an inch higher than my shoulder ! !","302791":"this message is intentionally vague and useless .","302792":"depends on what the person did to screw up their first chance .","302793":"yeah , lmao . i have absolutely no strength in my hands .","302794":"i m five feet tall .","302795":"you realize i m not a parent , right ? ? lmao .","302796":"the question was geared toward my own prospective son . i couldn t care less about what other people do to their children .","302797":"i agree . i think they actually meant solve , though , as a hypothetical question , which is why i answered the way i did .","302798":"i agree . that doesn t mean that rvpe wouldn t happen if a male couldn t get an erection , though . if they want to exert power and control over another individual in the form of rvpe , if they couldn t use their body parts , then they would likely find other sources .","302799":"i personally believe chemical castration would be morally right if it was effective in reducing rvpe , yeah . i m highly critical of people such as rvpists , and there s no punishment too severe for them .","302800":"you can rvpe someone with things other than a penis .","302801":"not at all . gmos are the reason why your produce seen in supermarkets are so plentiful . without gmos , your food would be scarce and not as abundant . gmos also help in aiding hunger and poverty in other nations .","302802":"i agree . or if there s some dire medical reason when he s an newborn or infant for the procedure to occur .","302803":"no . rvpe occurs out of a need for power control , it isn t usually solely out of a sxxual desire . men rvpe others as a means of exerting power over that individual .","302804":"me ! ! hahah .","302805":"out of basic human decency ? ? lol . everyone with the exception of a few select kinds of individuals deserves basic respect and decency . obviously if a person is being disrespectful or discriminatory towards another , they should be corrected . but the way you phrased this insinuates that everyone who is trans , gay , or female , etc etc . , are discriminatory , which obviously isn t the case .","302806":"i m against circumcision in general , so i wouldn t have it happen either way .","302807":"i m guessing you re also against gmos , lmao .","302808":"what s the definition of karma then ? ?","302809":"i m on the fence with astrology because i believe it might have some merit to it , but i ve never looked into it enough to have a real opinion .","302810":"i m a scorpio .","302811":"no , karma is different from cause effect . karma is the belief that an omniescent presence or source will reward those who are good and punish those who are bad . in reality , that s often not the case at all , which is why i don t believe in karma .","302812":"absolutely . you can be discriminatory against a person regardless of what or who you are , and just because you re from a discriminated group , it doesn t mean you re given a pass to be discriminatory either .","302813":"i normally watch tv shows or movies that revolve around crime or prison . i just finished up women behind bars i m currently watching the innocent man on netflix .","302814":"well , yeah . if you do something then it s going to have an effect on someone else or yourself , whether it s initially apparent or not .","302815":"technically , it s both . society is naturally discriminatory against people who are female , or trans , or mentally physically ill or disabled , or of a sexuality that isn t heterosexual . personally speaking , i ve had experiences with individuals also discriminating against me for those things as well .","302816":"no , i don t believe in karma .","302817":"no . granted , it isn t as unfair as other countries , but the united states still has a whole realm of injustices when it comes to the way the government treats its citizens .","302818":"i ve been discriminated against due to the fact that i m assigned female at birth , that i m non binary , that i m mentally ill , and that i m bisexual .","302819":"yeah , i ve been voting since i turned .","302820":"no , there have been instances where polling places were allegedly rigged to prevent certain people from voting , some people didn t come up as registered to vote even though they should have been , and votes from certain regions were apparently lost or weren t counted correctly .","302821":"no , not at all . everyone is comprised of unique experiences that have shaped them into the person they currently are , so really no two people are exactly alike due to the vast range of experiences we all have , as well as our innate personalities and behaviors which are attached to those experiences .","302822":"you brought up some really good points ! ! i can t copy paste on my phone but i did read all of your messages . i can understand it being complicated if the surrogate develops a connection with the child , because that can often happen even if the person thinks previously that they won t be emotionally involved . pregnancy alters your hormones so pretty much anything can happen in that regard , regardless of the legal documents involved in the case too .","302823":"i like rainbow cookies cannolis .","302824":"my personality type is infj .","302825":"i m a big fan of serif fonts , so fonts like century , cambria , goudy old style , and perpetua are among my favorites .","302826":"finding the motivation to get back into the habit of writing . i started writing in my mindfulness journal the other day , which i m going to start writing again today and tomorrow , but having an empty page in front of me has always been so daunting since i always place such high expectations on myself .","302827":"at the moment , expensive designer brands . i know a few people who exclusively purchase ridiculously expensive designer items , such as clothing and accessories , and i never saw the appeal in it because you can find something with the same if not better quality for a much cheaper price that isn t a designer brand .","302828":"i drink at least cups of coffee per day . i m only five feet tall most people think i m much taller , lol . i never learned how to ride a bicycle as a child . my passions include writing , the arts , and mental health advocacy . my favorite hobbies include listening to music and playing video games .","302829":"i m not entirely sure i don t know much about the whole immigration issue , to be quite honest , but i know building a multi billion dollar wall is definitely not going to help anything .","302830":"yes , i believe vaccinations should legally be mandatory . they re necessary for the survival of children , and it s extremely irresponsible to not vaccinate your children because even if they don t get sick , they can pass on those symptoms to children who are too young to get the necessary vaccinations . it s dangerous for everyone involved , and anti vaxx parents are partially the reasons why there have been such an outbreak of what used to be rare diseases in children .","302831":"i think giving children puberty blockers can be extremely detrimental to their growth and development , from a medical standpoint . i sympathize and understand the feelings of being in the wrong body , but i believe that a child should be at least or years old before they can start transitioning via hormones .","302832":"i m most proud of not having a relapse in symptoms in quite a few months still having the motivation to live my life even when hard times have fallen upon me . it s an amazing change to me , because in the past , any small inconvenience would trigger my depression anxiety mood instability , which made it extremely difficult to cope with life stressors . my next goals are to eventually need less medication , and perhaps my doctor and i can wean me off of at least one of my medications that may not be necessary anymore .","302833":"why wouldn t it be ethical ? ? i think it s a wonderful concept for parents who cannot carry a pregnancy to term on their own . it s helpful to a lot of parents who want a child with their own genes despite the fact that a pregnancy for them might be too high risk for them to carry the child themselves .","302834":"no , i don t support the death penalty . i think it s an easy way out , and those who commit gruesome or horrific crimes should get life in prison or solitary confinement , not a means by which they can escape their mistakes .","302835":"thank you ! ! i made it a few months ago , haha .","302836":"probably not i probably don t have the aptitude or strength to actually make it to space itself , and i really don t have a reason to go there .","302837":"love is my boyfriend holding my hand while he s driving , lighting my cigarette for me in the wee hours of the morning when the frost is still fresh on the grass , pulling me in closer in the middle of the night while we re sleeping under heavy blankets . love is my boyfriend calling me in the middle of his work day to ask me how i m doing , maintaining interest in the simple pleasures of my life , and discussing thoughts and ideas that come to mind . love is laughter and staying up late in the night because we lose track of time , taking road trips and listening to music together .","302838":"low ? ? idk what you mean by that .","302839":"well now that my inbox is empty , i m hella bored . lol . anyone have any question ? ?","302840":"i get scared when i m going into the garage to take the garbage out because it s so dark in there , lmao . i run to turn on the lights , because i still have that childish fear of someone or something hiding in the garage that will attack me .","302841":"that sounds like a you problem , not a me problem .","302842":"i ve had way too many usernames over the past years , so i guess i have been creative with them , lol .","302843":"sometimes , i do . they re not so much grudges as much as they are temporary feelings of dislike , though . they don t last very long i can go from disliking a friend for not texting me back or inviting me somewhere , to later on , talking to them as if nothing happened a few days later out of needing the social interaction .","302844":"no , my family doesn t have any traditions .","302845":"it just isn t something my family buys , and i m not the biggest fan of the taste anyway .","302846":"i don t normally eat crab .","302847":"i prefer blueberries , raspberries , peaches , and bananas . there aren t really any fruits i dislike , i just prefer the above ones over others . the fruit i probably dislike the most is blackberries , though . they just taste bitter to me .","302848":"i would prefer if abvsers , rvpists , p dophiles weren t members of society at all .","302849":"i would always prefer the former as opposed to the latter option . most of the time , bosses can be jerks because of the immense pressure on them to have tasks done in a timely manner and with efficiency , and sometimes their higher ups have unrealistic expectations . if that boss is a jerk but is also readily available to you at all times and willing to help , then that s a really good compromise .","302850":"a breakup can be a mutual agreement while still being hurtful to both parties , which is normally the case . i ve seen relationships where they broke up due to the understanding that they weren t in the right time frame to pursue their relationship further , and they ended up getting back together after a few years .","302851":"no , sleep deprivation is not a method of self harm . self harm is clearly defined in the dsm iv and dsm v as the intentional , direct injuring of the body without having svicidal intentions . this includes c tting , burning , scratching or hitting . it used to include skin picking hair pulling , but i don t think these classify as traditional methods of self harm anymore .","302852":"it depends on my mood , really . sometimes i have the patience to have a civil discussion about controversial topics , while other times i simply don t care to have any sort of conversation about them .","302853":"yes ! ! i m pretty much always listening to music , except for when i m at work music distracts me when i m working . however , when it comes to doing household chores or just being lazy at home , i m normally listening to music all the time .","302854":"if they re okay with hurting you , then they re probably not the right person , no . i was referring more to relationships where the breakup is a mutual agreement because they re not at the right moment of their lives to successfully pursue that relationship this is seen pretty often when people are attending college in different places . i understand waiting for that person , but i also understand breaking up temporarily so that each person can experience their lives and the people in their lives as it happens . just because you break up with someone also doesn t necessarily mean that they re never going to be in your life anymore , either .","302855":"hello i m doing well just drinking coffee , listening to music , answering questions . i kinda regret sleeping the whole morning away , but i suppose i needed it .","302856":"if you were running away , then you wouldn t have returned to askfm at all . sounds like you were just fed up with the people you were associated with , so you made a new account to start fresh .","302857":"i get those same feelings sometimes , yeah . however , you have to remember that nobody s life is perfect and people choose to only post about their successes and good times as opposed to their struggles . even so , sometimes it can be difficult to really watch those successes because they seem so much more poignant than our successes even if objectively that isn t the case , so i totally understand where you re coming from .","302858":"surprisingly , yes ! ! the second day of the year , my boss called me over to her desk to help set me up and train me on the administrative duties of one of the programs my company offers to their members . it s something she s been wanting to train me on for a while , but hasn t had the chance to because she s been so busy with everything else . so on wednesday , we sat down and discussed my responsibilities within the program and she gave me a bunch of assignments to complete for the rest of the week . i ended up finishing all of the outstanding orders from between wednesday and friday .","302859":"probably because i used the qotd last night to post anyone have any questions ? ? to invite people to ask me things , and then i ended up falling asleep shortly thereafter . lmao .","302860":"askfm instagram . i like askfm because i find the questions people ask me to be interesting , and it also gives me the opportunity to educate people about topics such as mental health . i also like reading my friends answers . instagram , i mainly use for ig stories and posting photos occasionally . it helps me keep in contact with some of my coworkers as well , and it s interesting to have that sneak peek of insight into another person s life when you view their stories .","302861":"i usually just go straight to the point , personally . however , it s not as if it s random because it s usually related to the initial conversation , lol . i m very honest and open with my friends boyfriend during conversations , so i have no issue with asking a question or something .","302862":"i know a fairly decent amount of information about drugs due to my own personal experiences with them . i think it s better to have an in depth understanding of drugs as opposed to being ignorant about them , because you simply don t know who in your life may be struggling with addiction and requires help . if you understand drugs and how they work , it ll be easier to help that person rather than if you had no idea about drugs whatsoever .","302863":"i m doing well i woke up not too long ago yes , even though it s noon . . . , so now i m just having my first cup of coffee for the day and checking up on social media . i found a lot of questions in my inbox , so i decided to hop on my laptop to answer them faster instead of wasting my phone s battery .","302864":"yes , i believe so . this coincides partially with my last answer regarding relationships , but if you and your partner don t have the same ideas in regards to the future to the point where you feel you must break up in order to progress further in your life , then it s completely possible for you to still love that person and vice versa while ending the relationship . in addition , i always found it interesting that some people can be the right person for each other , but they re simply at the wrong point in their lives to pursue that relationship .","302865":"lol , yes . the electricity for the entire block went down a few months ago , so we really couldn t do anything for a few hours until the power came back on . i ended up sitting with my parents and having really awkward , estranged conversation with them , which was absolutely terrible . i still had g on my phone so i could technically still use the internet , but i didn t want to waste my battery so i didn t use it at all .","302866":"yeah , i always check the date when i shop for food .","302867":"if you and your partner don t have the same ideas in mind in terms of your future , then there isn t really much you can do , unfortunately . your relationship may be great in the present moment , but that doesn t mean things won t see friction in the future when it comes to ideas such as marriage or having a family . at that point , it might be best for you two to break up in order to find someone else who better fits those interests .","302868":"i ve never been a fan of the color yellow especially like a mustard yellow . i know some people who really do love the color , though , and look great when they wear something with that color in it , but i ve personally never been a fan .","302869":"food products , yes . it isn t worth the risk of getting sick if something says it s expired , with the exception of some items if they still look smell taste fine . i won t f ck with dairy products , though . beauty products , not so much . i ve been using the same concealer for two years , and it s been perfectly fine for me , lol .","302870":"i ve never concerned myself with becoming popular on askfm , so i really have no clue . i suppose just remaining active on the site asking questions , answering questions , liking other people s answers , making polls , etc etc .","302871":"for the most part , yes . especially when it comes to buying things off of amazon . there are so many similar products that it s difficult to really determine which one is the best one , so the review section is extremely helpful in that regard .","302872":"my boyfriend has facial hair , so yes . however , even when he does shave which has only happened maybe once or twice , lol , he s still attractive to me .","302873":"i only obviously wear them during the summer , but they re usually uncomfortable for me .","302874":"dogs pit bulls , huskies , golden retrievers , corgis , golden doodles , tibetan mastiffs , and bull terriers . cats i don t know much about cat breeds , but maine coons are beautiful .","302875":"yes . hence the term anti circumcision .","302876":"i ve never really seen any cool animals in the wild . i ve only ever seen them at aquariums and zoos .","302877":". bad habit i want to break skinpicking . . new skill i want to learn more about the indesign program . . a good deed helping others in need . . place i d like to visit australia new

company .","302880":"no . i find it easier to take things day by day lately . looking at the whole year in its entirety is daunting to me right now .","302881":"tell them that their behavior is wrong and unacceptable and discipline them accordingly .","302882":"my boyfriend close friends are close to me on an emotional level .","302883":"hell no , lol . i m not funny and i m anxious in front of crowds .","302884":"lol . yes , or larger .","302885":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302886":"i buy them occasionally , but only when i run out of previous items . right now , i ve only been using witch hazel with rose water a black charcoal face lotion .","302887":"it means you have zero chance . they re interested in someone else .","302888":"that would be fairly hypocritical of me , considering i m bi , lol . i wouldn t treat them any differently at all .","302889":"a sloth wrapped in a blanket burrito with a cigarette in one hand a cup of coffee in the other .","302890":"probably either skyrim or fallout .","302891":"no , i don t have a planner because i don t need one . i used to use one to mark down homework and assignments when i was in school , so i haven t used one since i graduated .","302892":"why don t y all just ask me questions that come to mind . i hate having to scroll figure out which question corresponds with which number , lol .","302893":"it s been raining all day , gray skies , and really cold miserable .","302894":"sometimes , i do . it s easier for me to sit and watch an episode that s minutes long as opposed to a two hour long movie .","302895":"yeah , i can sleep for upwards of hours straight if i wanted .","302896":"i don t reveal that on askfm .","302897":"i usually feel better when i m productive , but i haven t had the motivation to do anything today .","302898":"god no . and if you re insinuating that , you can kindly leave my page .","302899":"for the most part , yeah . i splurge on things every now and again , but i still transfer money to my savings account occasionally .","302900":"i don t really think anyone is sexy , lol .","302901":"sometimes . i prefer tv shows , it captures my interest more . although i ve been wanting to watch fantastic beasts where to find them .","302902":"i am not a serial killer by dan wells .","302903":"i m all right . a bit bored tbh . i want to go out , but it s a saturday and everywhere is going to be packed full of people .","302904":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302905":"no , i don t gamble .","302906":"yeah i m probably going to regret wasting my time today because i could have ideally ran errands this afternoon , but the weather has been so terrible that i didn t want to leave the house .","302907":"it s been all right . i haven t done much except sleep all day . and drink coffee .","302908":"ask me questions either here or on tellonym https tellonym . me poetalunam","302909":"boring . i initially woke up at am , stayed up for an hour , then went back to bed until am . i made a cup of coffee and had breakfast , then i played fallout for about two hours . afterwards , i basically just laid in bed . not even sleeping , just laying there kinda sleepy in that half awake stage just enjoying how cozy my bed is . my boyfriend just got out of work so we talked for half an hour , and now idk what to really do .","302910":"no , i ve never been banned from any social media site before .","302911":"i usually just take advil deal with it .","302912":"no , they ve always been anonymous .","302913":"it s easy to control my shopping regardless of whether it s online or in stores . the only thing i really splurge on is coffee .","302914":"this is so sweet , aw . you re welcome and if you need anything else , you can always confide in me","302915":"oh , okay . it s difficult for me to tell the difference between certain anons , lol . thank you , though","302916":"for some people , it could very much mean so . there s a separation between gender and rebelling against societal expectations . personally speaking , i wanted to be a boy for much of my earlier life , even my parents have told me stories of me wanting to be a boy and dressing as a boy and not doing certain things because boys didn t do those things . it s different . and i understand that because you re not non binary or trans , that you may not understand it completely . however , that doesn t mean that you can t respect people still even if you disagree with them .","302917":"considering i ve never been a woman , this doesn t apply to me . i haven t been comfortable identifying as a woman or a girl my entire life , even before i was aware of the traditional societal expectations that are placed upon women . it s only been within the past three years that i discovered what non binary meant , and before that , i just used the term genderfluid .","302918":"thank you , i m quite aware of the whole societal norms concept .","302919":"i m happy that they discovered who they truly are , as it takes a lot of self realization to really figure out things that are so integral to your sense of self . that doesn t change my gender , though . just because a few people i know realized they weren t non binary doesn t mean that i m not .","302920":"as a person who tried their hardest to help others without sacrificing their own happiness as a result . as someone who made a difference in other people s lives , even if just for the smallest reasons .","302921":"you have to have communication in your relationship sit her down and tell her how you honestly feel , how it s affecting you , and how you feel like things used to be fun but aren t much anymore . perhaps you two can come to a compromise regarding how to liven up your relationship again . if that doesn t work , then break up . relationships are supposed to be fun , even if you ve been with someone a long time , and you should never lose that sense of fun .","302922":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302923":"draco malfoy is my favorite character . i ve always loved the series because it was the first book series that i really got into growing up , and it entirely influenced my decision to start writing my own stories .","302924":"i had a hoop in my right nostril for like three months a few years ago up until it fell out in my sleep , lmao . i never went to get it re pierced after that . right now , i know for sure that i want a traditional looking dagger , as well as a quill dipped in ink . they re both going to be on my right arm . idk what else i want specifically after that , but i do know that i want them to revolve around things like harry potter and video games .","302925":"i originally wanted my nose re pierced , but i don t know if i want it anymore . however , i want a lot more tattoos enough for full sleeves at the very least .","302926":"i think it depends on what the crimes are . but i m not entirely sure what my stance is on this , i don t know anything about the adoption process .","302927":"cheez its , or cheddar sour cream chips .","302928":"p dophilia isn t a sexuality , and their desire to infiltrate the lgbtq community is absolutely disgusting . that s all i m saying further on this topic . the only reason why i answered this question was because it wasn t previously asked to me two days ago or yesterday .","302929":"my has been good so far , actually . i haven t done much except work , but i saw my best friend last night , which was a lot of fun . i m just happy it s the weekend rn , the past three work days absolutely dragged i know i m going to regret complaining about this when next week comes around i have to work the full five days , lmao .","302930":"i would continue blocking ignoring his messages , unless they get to the point where you could pursue legal action against him .","302931":"idk what you guys don t understand about i m not discussing this anymore , but it s getting a little aggravating at this point . i m not going to spread this rhetoric out for what will be three days in a row now . you guys already know my opinions , just accept that for what they are and leave it alone .","302932":"no , white people can be subjected to discrimination , but not racism . racism is a system of oppression characterized by decades , if not centuries , of harm , and white people were often the people doing the oppressing , not being a victim to the oppression .","302933":"i am not a serial killer by dan wells . i got through the book in maybe two days , it was so compelling . i also own the next two books in the series so i might read them soon .","302934":"no , i ve never been one to talk much or gossip at all .","302935":"my fallout character ! !","302936":"no , i ve never babysat before .","302937":"you re welcome ! ! unfortunately , lexapro wasn t strong enough for me when i tried taking that medication . but i m on a pretty good regimen now that i found which ones worked best for me , and i think it s almost time for me to try to start weaning myself off of one of them as it might be unnecessary now .","302938":"ah , that s good that you re not feeling any detrimental effects ! ! there are a few downsides to antidepressants and other psych meds , but if you re feeling better off of them , then perhaps they weren t the best ones for you . i hope you continue to feel okay , friend .","302939":"yeah , it was terrible . my depression relapsed and i felt horrible until i could get my medication again .","302940":"not an extended period of time , but it happened for about a week of me going without that medication . which reminds me i have to see if my refill is ready on one of my meds , they haven t been able to fill it because of a shortage i m running low on it .","302941":"anyone awake have questions ? ?","302942":"highly doubtful . while some of them are illegal immigrants , it isn t all of them there s already a large ms presence here so it isn t as if building a wall is going to make them leave .","302943":"always has been and probably always will be .","302944":"haha , that s cute . it s always been on my bucket list of places to go . i usually prefer small , quaint towns but providence seems right up my alley too .","302945":"i haven t , but i ve always wanted to go ! ! apparently it s very gay friendly , right ? ?","302946":"pro choice pro lgbtq rights pro vaccinations anti circumcision pro legalization of marijuana i m also incredibly passionate about the arts and mental health awareness .","302947":"how opinionated i am . i only discuss my opinions when asked , which is hardly ever , but i do hold some strong opinions .","302948":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302949":"i sneeze when i look into the sun .","302950":"i usually forget what they even are a few months into the year .","302951":"progress further with my mental health , work better on my physical health , write and read more often , and gain more responsibilities at work .","302952":"lately i ve been playing fallout , but i also play destiny , assassin s creed , bioshock , tomb raider , skyrim , far cry , and a few others .","302953":"i ve only ever used xbox consoles , so i don t really have a basis for comparison .","302954":"rum soaked cannoli cake or rainbow cookie cake .","302955":"xbox one .","302956":"play video games , sleep , drink , and vent to friends .","302957":"i always respect people until they give me a reason not to respect them anymore .","302958":"i m nice until i m given a reason not to be anymore .","302959":"i m doing well . a bit tired , so i might go to bed early tonight . i was supposed to see my best friend tonight , but she hasn t gotten back to me yet so i don t think we re hanging out tonight anymore .","302960":"he slept around a lot from a young age , among other things .","302961":"i m not even sure if i even want children to begin with .","302962":"he wants a daughter , but i can envision us having a son , lol . he s afraid to have a son because he wouldn t want him to grow up and behave the way he behaved when he was younger .","302963":"in eight years , i ll be . so i ll probably be married to my boyfriend with a house and a bunch of animals .","302964":"just one , which is fine by me .","302965":"i m not wrong . i just stated that i m not discussing this topic again because i already discussed this last night , and answered the same question you re currently posing last night . i don t want to repeat myself , so if you re interested in my thoughts on the subject , you can scroll down to last night s answers .","302966":"i wouldn t consider it cheating if they re not doing anything besides flirting , if it s harmless . i would just be concerned about them progressing further with it .","302967":"why would you flirt with someone if you didn t have an intention to progress further with it ? ? i don t really see the point .","302968":"i m not discussing this topic again . i spent most of last night discussing this on askfm .","302969":"i m mainly concerned with the fact that i poured my heart out into a piece of literature then someone else would claim that they wrote it or had those experiences .","302970":"i posted one of my poems here a few days ago , but i m hesitant to post it again because i don t want people stealing my content .","302971":"i m not the biggest fan of chocolate , but i ll have it occasionally .","302972":"nonfiction like personal essays , poetry , and fiction usually drama or thriller .","302973":"yeah , but i m not talking about this topic again today . i spent most of last night discussing this topic on askfm .","302974":"no , she doesn t care about the fact that i smoke . that doesn t make a difference in our sessions .","302975":"yeah , at least i try to . sometimes i forget .","302976":"i m never usually lonely , no . i value my alone time and i m usually content with being by myself , unless i haven t seen my boyfriend in a long time .","302977":"not for myself personally , but i m afraid of my loved ones dying .","302978":"lol . or it s just me being an unorganized , chaotic mess .","302979":"i was a straight a student when i was in high school college .","302980":"if your relationship is based off of a foundation of jealousy , then that isn t a healthy relationship . you should ideally feel comfortable and content in your relationships with the understanding that there s no need to be jealous because of each other s importance and value in your lives .","302981":"that s generally what most people do , yeah .","302982":"i always lose my fucking lighters . i only have one left i m so paranoid that i m going to lose this one too , lol .","302983":"thankfully , no . the unfortunate part of that is that i have no idea if i m allergic to bees , so i avoid them at all costs .","302984":"lmao , no . the feeling of being caged is more of an emotional feeling related to my environment than anything else . i still live within a toxic environment that s detrimental to my mental health .","302985":"my home life , in particular .","302986":"no , you re not making any sense . i m just going to delete any further questions related to this line of thinking .","302987":"because my feelings of being caged aren t in relation to my occupation .","302988":"a state of joy or contentment in one s life , relationships , occupation , and or hobbies , to the point where those feelings permeate everything else , giving an individual an uplifted nature and perspective on their life .","302989":"uh , what ? ? this makes no sense .","302990":"i actually do , which is such a relief for me because i m so used to working jobs that either stressed me out too much or that i disliked . i like the content that i write , my duties as an editor , and the fact that i m being given more responsibility . it also helps that i m good at my job , lol .","302991":"in the past , i would have said yes that i would have chosen not to be born . however , i ve found new hope and motivation to live my life with the support of my boyfriend , friends , and therapist , so these days i would say that i would have chosen to live my life .","302992":"a consumer . i think one of the few ways a person can actually be a producer is if they run their own business .","302993":"no , most of the time i feel like i m caged , unless i m on vacation somewhere .","302994":"i think the idea of reincarnation is interesting , but idk if i necessarily believe in it .","302995":"i ve never heard of that before .","302996":"either honey bunches of oats , or captain crunch if i want something sweeter .","302997":"probably not . i don t really have an interest in doing anything extreme like that .","302998":"i feel sane every day .","302999":"why is this something you re choosing to send as a mass message ? ? much confuse .","303000":"i m bored , anyone have any questions ? ?","303001":"no , i ve never cheated on anyone before .","303002":"my day has been productive ! ! i got a lot of work done at my job today , and my commute home was a lot easier than normal , so that was a relief . other than work , i haven t done much considering i only got home about an hour ago . i tidied up my room , made a cup of coffee , and now i m messaging my boyfriend and checking up on social media .","303003":"i don t stream on twitch or mixer , but i do have accounts on both to watch other people stream .","303004":"for me personally , the best way to study was when i put on instrumental music rewrote my notes to gain a better grasp of the material . i would also read them over every few days to keep the material fresh in my mind . the worst way to study , from my experience , is by cramming the material in the day before the exam . it s information overload and there s a great chance of you not remembering crucial information .","303005":"all the time , haha . the last thing i recently tried to fix but failed was my set of drawers where i put my clothes . the middle drawer ended up breaking , so i tried pushing it back into place it only made it worse . i can t afford a new set of drawers rn so i m just dealing with it for the moment .","303006":"verbally , yes . through text , no . i have a hard time verbalizing my thoughts and feelings because the words don t come to me as eloquently , but it s a much different story when i m typing or writing something down .","303007":"in a heartbeat . i m unhappy with the way my body looks , and often it doesn t feel like it s my body , even though i try to cover it with tattoos in an effort to like myself more .","303008":"does anyone else hear chester bennington s voice in this song ? ? it s three days grace , but the singer sounds so much like chester , omg . https youtu . be tudju ygvew","303009":"yeah , they are kinda expensive . i only had it once like a month ago so i don t remember how much i paid . i ordered for my boyfriend , myself , and his father off of doordash .","303010":"yes i m obsessed with their fries . their burgers are small but i prefer that over large burgers , lmao . it s just easier to eat , and i don t usually eat too much in one meal anyway .","303011":"i accept your opinion and gracefully disagree . if we re talking about the same definition of stiff , that is .","303012":"i tried smashburger recently it was ridiculously good ! ! their burgers are really tasty you can customize everything .","303013":"uh , physically or mentally ? ? lol . because my back . . . is very stiff . it s been hurting me for months now .","303014":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303015":"tacos margaritas with my best friend .","303016":"whenever something makes me chuckle , so probably a few times per day . otherwise , i have resting b tch face .","303017":"yes lol . omg . . . it s so bad sometimes . idk what i do in my sleep but sometimes i wake up my cheek is soaked .","303018":"yes , lol . oh my god , one of my coworkers snorted while laughing this afternoon and i heard her from across the office . we made direct eye contact she started laughing even harder . it was the highlight of my day .","303019":"is legally an adult . i ve never considered anyone over the age of to be a child .","303020":"you asked me this off anon a few days ago . no , i m not interested in their music .","303021":"if that s what you d like to believe , then there isn t much i can do to change your mind . i m steadfast in my resolutions and conclusions regarding my gender at this point , and you ll eventually have to accept that .","303022":"alternative rock , r b , hip hop , blues , metal , some pop music , and instrumentals classical music .","303023":"i don t have plans besides maybe seeing my best friend , either tonight or tomorrow night . otherwise , i m just going to clean more , do more laundry , and play fallout .","303024":"haha , it s nearly pm in new york .","303025":"i require professional help for my mental illnesses , but that has no correlation with my gender .","303026":"hello i just got home from work i m waiting to see if my best friend still wants to go out to dinner tonight .","303027":"i m not normal for a lot of different reasons .","303028":"anons will always find something to complain about , lol .","303029":"i don t really see the big deal . i m allowed to be friends with people considering we have common interests and experiences .","303030":"she s also in her late teens . wow . two people . lmfao .","303031":"the only person i can think of who s still a teenager is sweetnothings , and she s in her late teens .","303032":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303033":"he ordered it online . we opened the box and were like well . . . all rightey then .","303034":"we bought a bunch of toys , we just didn t think it was going to be this massive inch long schlong . lmao .","303035":"you haven t lived until your boyfriend suction cups a massive purple d ldo onto his forehead and starts dabbing .","303036":"that isn t something i can really determine at this point in my life .","303037":"my day went well , actually my boss trained me on some new programs at work she s giving me more administrative duties and more responsibilities , so that s exciting . my boyfriend also had a good day at work , which always makes me happy since he s obviously in a much better mood when he has a good day , lol . we ve been talking on and off since i got home from work a few hours ago . i m probably going to end up going to bed soon , considering i m exhausted now .","303038":"i have a terrible memory , so it doesn t surprise me that i don t remember her .","303039":"lol probably . i ve never seen that either though .","303040":"same , man . i m just deleting the rest of any questions statements whatever that are in relation to this topic . i guess after tumblr got rid of all of their p rn , the users came to askfm . uck .","303041":"why did i think anon was talking about a television show ? ? lol .","303042":"i think i ve been on askfm for maybe years ? ? i don t remember .","303043":"i don t know what you re talking about .","303044":"i suppose so ? ? it s difficult to ask me that question because i don t find anyone attractive other than my boyfriend , lmao .","303045":". . . the difference is because people in the lgbtq community aren t attracted to children . why is this so different for these anons to comprehend ? ? it s literally that simple , lmao .","303046":"gender has nothing to do with mental illness or p dophilia . damn , you guys are really grasping at straws now .","303047":"attraction a desire to perform sxxual acts upon a person . i m pretty done with this whole conversation , though . the amount of people actually sympathizing with literal p dophiles on my page rn is disgusting .","303048":". . . did you really just insinuate that being attracted to children isn t wrong ? ? oh boy . all right , i mma just leave this here . my case has been closed .","303049":"i already posted my opinion on that stance a few answers ago . in short , non offending p dophiles are at high risk of acting on their thoughts and the rate in which p dophilia is cured is significantly low . for the safety of everyone involved , prison is the only answer in my eyes .","303050":"that s exactly what i was thinking . people with mood disorders or personality disorders among others are often the victims of sxxual abvse themselves . to compare depression anxiety bpd psychosis whatever with p dophilia is unfounded .","303051":"you re sounding like a p do apologist , and if this continues , then i m discontinuing this discussion . in simple terms , you can t compare p dophilia with other disorders because it s literally a criminal offense .","303052":"it makes no difference to me . if you re attracted to children , then you can rot in prison regardless of whether or not you ve acted on your thoughts or why you developed that attraction to begin with . it s inherently wrong , immoral , and disgusting .","303053":"according to scientific reports , p dophilia is attraction to prepubescent children , so i m assuming there isn t a concrete age .","303054":"the fact that they re a p dophile automatically means that their very existence is wrong .","303055":". . . you can t compare stealing something to someone being attracted to children .","303056":"p dophiles rarely seek professional treatment for their attraction because they either don t believe that what they re thinking is wrong , or if they do know it s wrong , they re less likely to report their thoughts to a professional in fear of imprisonment , considering it s a criminal offense . that being said , the rate in which p dophiles actually recover from their attraction is significantly low . they re better off just being thrown in jail , in my opinion , so that they re not given any opportunity to act on their desires .","303057":"i m watching the innocent man on netflix , it s really good so far . i had to start it over from the beginning because i couldn t remember the episodes , but the case is incredibly interesting and chilling . y all should ask me questions","303058":"probably to some degree , yeah . i don t really remember much of that sort of thing , though .","303059":"uh , i never said anything about therapy or medication .","303060":"lmao , yes they do . even when you re upset or angry , you still have an idea of what s acceptable versus unacceptable behavior .","303061":"no . being mentally ill doesn t excuse you from acting out on problematic or toxic behavior . you don t get a pass just because you re mentally ill . you still know right from wrong .","303062":"yes i believe that p dophiles are inherently bad people even if they never acted out on their fantasies .","303063":"i ve done some pretty terrible things , but i m not an inherently bad person .","303064":"i ve known i ve been mentally ill since i was years old . i didn t start seeking formal treatment until i was years old . so no my conclusions weren t based on what people told me , those diagnoses were established after i discussed my ongoing symptoms with a professional for several appointments .","303065":"it s impossible to conclude that all people in a group are one way or another life isn t black white like that . while there are some people who are genuinely terrible people who probably do struggle with unresolved mental health issues , that doesn t infer that everyone who is a bad person must have a mental illness .","303066":"where have i ever suggested that mental illness doesn t exist . lmfao . did you forget that i m in ongoing treatment for my own mental illnesses ? ?","303067":"like i said earlier , it s wrong to armchair diagnosis a person without conducting a formal psychiatric evaluation on them . there have been concerns about trump s mental health in the past , but considering no one who made those claims ever met trump or are likely not even mental health practitioners , then their claims are unfounded . it s easy to point at a bad person and attribute their behavior to mental illness , but that only adds to the stigma surrounding mental health . there are simply people out there who are genuinely bad people and that has nothing to do with mental illness .","303068":"i don t think it s really correct to assume that someone automatically has a mental illness solely because they believe in god . it s also wrong to armchair diagnosis people without actually knowing them or performing a formal psychiatric evaluation individually .","303069":"there are some things that are really ableist , while there are other things that are slightly ableist . your questions about schizophrenia lead me to believe that you have a slightly ableist mindset when it comes to mental illness .","303070":"for your information .","303071":"you re probably better off asking someone who s actually schizophrenic . btw these questions are leaning toward the ableist end of the spectrum , fyi .","303072":"schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by changes in genetic composition and chemical imbalances that lend themselves to some of the primary symptoms of schizophrenia , such as hallucinations , delusions , paranoia , etc etc . people who think they can talk to god or have seen visions from god aren t normally mentally ill or have those specific chemical compositions . that s why disorders like schizophrenia are medical conditions , while believing in god is just religious belief .","303073":"moving away to attend college for the first time was a bittersweet feeling , since i was moving away from my best friend my boyfriend . it was good for me because obviously i wanted to pursue an education , but i was also sad because i was leaving them behind .","303074":"i kissed my boyfriend goodbye when i left his house last saturday after we returned from our mini vacation .","303075":"i like my boyfriend . he s the only man i m interested in .","303076":"it s something we ve been battling for a while , and we re both unhappy with it so it s something that sometimes causes friction in our relationship . however , i m planning on talking to my doctor about possibly taking me off of the antipsychotic since my depression has improved greatly since i was initially prescribed it , and i know that prescription is contributing a lot to my low libido . otherwise , we just recently bought a few toys so we ll see if those spice things up too .","303077":"i m pretty content right now ! ! i m looking forward to work because i got trained on a new program today and i m going to be given more administrative duties and responsibilities soon .","303078":"if you truly want to know , the combination of being on birth control as a teenager as well as being prescribed antipsychotic medication has dwindled my libido to the point where it doesn t exist anymore .","303079":"i just finished watching women behind bars on netflix . i might continue watching the innocent man or the chilling adventures of sabrina .","303080":"i ve been with my boyfriend for nearly a decade . obviously i ve had sex before .","303081":"i have plenty of hobbies . most recently , i ve been more involved in writing , playing video games , and listening to music .","303082":"no , i don t experience that feeling very often at all . it used to be a lot more prevalent in the past , but it was more in terms of watching and keeping tabs on me , and i was unsure of whether or not it was with good intent .","303083":"in the past , quite frequently . however , more recently , not so much . ever since starting medication and therapy , i ve developed greater insight into my conditions regarding where they came from and how to manage them when my symptoms flare up .","303084":"i think the concept of having a past life or multiple past lives is interesting , but idk if i necessarily believe in it .","303085":"my calves are too fat to wear tight boots . i m also too short to wear high boots .","303086":"i don t even know what that is , lmao .","303087":"yes , i have a boyfriend . i actually just got off the phone with him .","303088":"as my bio clearly states , i m years old .","303089":"smoking a cigarette outside . i just got home from work .","303090":"i don t discuss my financial situations on askfm .","303091":"i ve always had a double chin , lol . my jawline is nonexistent .","303092":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303093":"i guess that s up to them whether they feel comfortable using it or not , considering the racism behind the n word is still in their heritage , whether it s from their maternal or paternal side .","303094":"i agree other people s opinions shouldn t make a difference to you , especially considering a majority of those people are meaningless to your life . i also agree that it s fine to be silly and a little immature at times because it keeps you youthful , and it s always nice to have innocent fun every once in a while . my boyfriend and i can act immature around each other , lol .","303095":"i don t use the n word i would seriously reconsider being friends with someone if they weren t black and used the n word without realizing the implications of it .","303096":"i ve been awake for the past hours , lol .","303097":"no , it isn t snowing out rn .","303098":"i don t follow trends , so i have no clue .","303099":"this describes my life every damn morning i need to wake up for work .","303100":"i wasn t awake when you sent this to me , no .","303101":"no , i don t have schizophrenia .","303102":"i have ! ! that was a good show too .","303103":"i definitely prefer small groups of people . large crowds make me nervous .","303104":"lmao . well , i said drink less often . not drink at all .","303105":"i ve heard of it before , but i never watched it .","303106":"women behind bars ! ! i m obsessed with any show that has to do with prison or true crime , lmao .","303107":"send me questions while i drink some wine finish up this netflix series","303108":"words don t matter when they re coming from a person whose existence is meaningless to your life .","303109":"i suppose tips for creative writing ? ? i m not really sure , there s nothing i m really ridiculously good at or knowledgeable of .","303110":"when you have nothing productive to add to a conversation , or things that are only inherently hurtful or negative that the other person cannot change .","303111":"it was about a week ago . i remember feeling horribly angry to the point where i wanted to self destruct , but i honestly can t even remember the reason why .","303112":"i m usually running from my own thoughts and i m constantly finding ways to distract myself , whether it s by playing video games or sleeping or working or drinking .","303113":"the article says that black people are more likely to die from smoking related diseases , so i m guessing that has something to do with it .","303114":"probably when i get cancer .","303115":"did you read the whole article ? ? it s talking about advertisements menthol cigarettes are advertised more to minority communities than white communities .","303116":"wow , i ve never realized that before ! ! thank you for sharing this , that s an extremely interesting article .","303117":"i m not aware of any racist history behind smoking . would you care to elaborate ? ?","303118":"it usually lasts me about two or three hours before i start craving another cigarette .","303119":"i honestly don t remember . this is going back at least years ago .","303120":"i was a teenager in high school , and when i wasn t in school , i was constantly brainstorming and writing and editing my own work . there were two nights in particular that i was so obsessed with perfecting that i was writing that i stayed up all night for two nights in a row .","303121":"bugs crawling all over my arms and on the walls behind my computer . i was about hours sleep deprived at the time , so what i experienced was pretty expected at that point .","303122":"i m addicted to nicotine , first and foremost . however , i started smoking because it quelled my anxiety and relaxed me .","303123":"i ve had visual hallucinations before , but never heard voices .","303124":"i m curious as to why you re hesitant to think that it s nice to meet me .","303125":"i m currently smoking a cigarette , actually .","303126":"i wish i didn t start shing when i was a pre teen . it led to a devastating , nearly a decade long addiction that completely swallowed everything i said and did , and i m still facing the repurcussions of those actions . i accept that it s a part of myself that i can t reverse , but i feel like it was the catalyst to the rest of my addictions that have followed since then .","303127":"i don t really think i m an expert on anything . i know a lot about a few different topics , such as the english language and mental illnesses , but not enough to call myself an expert . there s probably still so much more i can learn .","303128":"i don t feel guilty or ashamed of any things i find pleasurable . if i like something , then y all are going to just have to deal with it , lol .","303129":"hell no , lmao . heels are the most uncomfortable shoes i ve ever attempted to wear , and i can t walk in them at all . my boyfriend walks in heels better than i can .","303130":"i had pictures on myspace , but those are long gone by now , lol . the earliest photos i have are from maybe , photos that i have saved in albums on my current facebook page .","303131":"i m doing well i had a long day at work , but traffic wasn t terrible on my commute home so i got home earlier than expected . i managed to stop by and grab coffee cigarettes . now i m just relaxing in my pajamas while drinking coffee and checking up on social media .","303132":"chester bennington was my idol , and even after his death , he still remains my idol despite the circumstances . he taught me how to cope with my surroundings gave me an outlet when i was suffering with severe depression and svicidal thoughts . if it wasn t for him and his music , i probably would have died more than a decade ago .","303133":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303134":"in terms of hairstyle , it was when i was years old and chopped all of my hair off into a really short pixie cut . in terms of hair color , it was when i was years old and colored my hair pitch black .","303135":"my mother . she s incredibly nosy and deflects blame onto everyone except herself , so she often voices her opinion and claims that everyone else is wrong and she s correct which is rarely the actual case . i ve learned not to tell her anything personal because she would always turn it against me and use it as a weapon to berate me , and then she would vocally complain about my feelings to other people while i was in earshot . i ve learned to simply only talk to her under necessary circumstances .","303136":"uh . . . what does this have to do with ceiling fans ? ? lol . yeah , long island is kinda known for its large jewish community .","303137":"once every two weeks , which is probably less often than i ideally should wash them , lol . i put a new mattress pad on my bed yesterday afternoon while i was washing my sheets and blankets , and i slept like a damn baby last night .","303138":"three , i believe . one in the living room , one in the kitchen , and one in my parents bedroom .","303139":"aw , happy new year to you as well . i hope you had a good holiday too .","303140":"i absolutely love it . brightly colored and neon lipstick are beautiful , especially when paired with a bright or neutral eye palette . there s so much versatility when it comes to makeup , it s practically an art form .","303141":"it isn t something i want to really discuss on askfm , sorry .","303142":"eh , not really . it was nice having so many days off from work , lol . i went back to work today after being off since pm last friday , and it was a bittersweet feeling . i still got a lot of work done , though it felt as if i was looking at material with a fresh set of eyes .","303143":"i ve never listened to that type of music before , but i assume that i probably won t like it .","303144":"my new years eve was fine i didn t do anything , i just stayed home and drank a little bit . i think i was asleep by am , haha .","303145":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303146":"probably that i m fine , even when i m really not . in the past , i often had to put on a facade to show others that i was okay even though i felt horrible inside . eventually it got to the point where i was constantly lying to myself when i felt terrible , which isn t a healthy thing to do .","303147":"no , i play on xbox one .","303148":"sometimes ! ! we just bought fallout this past week so we started playing together a few days ago . before that , i would join him and his friends on games like gta v , days to die , and destiny .","303149":"just before ! ! my boyfriend and i were playing fallout earlier .","303150":"probably not my boyfriend i have an xbox date tonight when he gets out of work at pm , so we ll probably be playing for a few hours .","303151":"i ve never used one before are they only around in big city areas ? ? i think it s a bit ridiculous to make a person pay money to use the restroom . i can kinda understand why it would be put in place , since the people who maintain it need to be paid too , but idk . it just sounds super privileged to me .","303152":"no , i ve never had a reason to sue anyone before .","303153":"i m doing well ! ! i just finished cleaning doing laundry i think i did about six loads altogether , including my sheets and blankets . i also organized a few shelves my makeup corner , and vacuumed as well . whew . now all i need to do is take a shower after i calm down drink a lot of water . and then drink a glass of wine .","303154":"not recently , no . most of my friendships dwindle away over time , i don t necessarily have falling outs with them for a specific reason . we just stop talking as time goes on until we don t talk anymore .","303155":"at times , lol . sometimes i trip up the stairs or on cracks in the sidewalk , but thankfully i ve never fallen flat on my face before .","303156":"i haven t played a board game in a really long time , lol . i used to like parcheesi .","303157":"physically my back hurts and i m congested , but otherwise i m okay . i also have a nasty cough , but i m assuming i have a cold so that s to be expected . mentally i m actually doing well lately . today i have this profound motivation to clean everything , which is unheard of for me because i struggle with motivation most of all but today it s nonexistent . i haven t felt depressed in a month or two , and while my anxiety has been acting up due to the weather and stuff , it s definitely manageable . i even decreased my therapy sessions from once per week to once every two weeks .","303158":"i ve done so much laundry tonight that i lost count of how many loads i ve done . however , i ve also cleaned and organized a few of my shelves , including my lil makeup corner , which makes me hella happy because it s been long overdue . send me questions , y all","303159":"i wouldn t date someone who s considered a boy , period . i m also in a relationship , so i have no intentions on dating anyone else . my boyfriend is taller than me , skinnier than me , and stronger than me , so take that as you wish .","303160":"he s attracted to people who are a bit on the thicker side , moreso healthy looking as opposed to super skinny .","303161":"my boyfriend doesn t care about the hair on my legs , lmao . if he was concerned , he would have brought it up to me ages ago .","303162":"that wouldn t happen if that was the case , then he would have left me two years ago when i first started putting on weight .","303163":"push him off and tell him that his action was completely unacceptable . people just don t go sitting on strangers laps , it s not okay behavior at all .","303164":"lmao . the only thing i ll answer is that he s years old .","303165":"it smells so good , omg . my boyfriend s step mother gave it to me as part of an xmas gift , and i m in love with it .","303166":"i re organized the shelf above my bed it looks so cute now ! !","303167":"of course ! !","303168":"something that s too vulgar and grotesque to describe on askfm . it was a reoccurring dream when i was a teenager i would always wake up screaming with a panic attack .","303169":"i remember her early music really hit home for me when i was a teenager , so that s why i enjoyed her music .","303170":"i have no idea what you re trying to say , uh . . .","303171":"i listened to that when i was in middle school i think it was middle school .","303172":"alternative rock , mostly . i also listen to some hip hop and video game soundtracks .","303173":"i ve never been a big fan of their music .","303174":"i don t really listen to heavy metal , no . the only artists i listen to that could be somewhat classified as metal are otep and in this moment .","303175":"matt maeson , grandson , two feet , bryce vine , mike shinoda . idk anything mainstream pop music , so i don t have anything to say regarding that .","303176":"i was fairly happy with the music i discovered in ! ! i m not sure if they all premiered in itself , but i discovered a lot of artists that i enjoy a lot i also went to two concerts .","303177":"i love him with my entire being soul . i always try to show my appreciation and gratitude whenever possible .","303178":"i ve seen that was a rough year for a lot of different people . in any case , i hope treats you well .","303179":"happy new year to you as well ! !","303180":"ideally , i would want it to be smaller more rustic whimsical . homemade center pieces and goodies , an alter surrounded by flowers , and somewhere preferably outdoors . however , it s a bit unrealistic due to how big our families are most likely , we ll have it in a moderately fancy catering hall with a dance floor and an open bar , but i would still want it to be woodsy feeling with homemade pieces and flowers .","303181":"something i wrote earlier this year","303182":"i don t know what you mean by this .","303183":"probably , yeah . i already know that i don t want to wear one of those poofy white dresses , though , or something with a train . i can see myself wearing a sleek , off white dress with a rose gold overlay and with lace .","303184":"i m listening to music drinking coffee while waiting for my laundry to finish . i just organized most of my clothes and i m planning on putting a mattress pad on my bed this afternoon .","303185":"hello do you have a question ? ?","303186":"no , he doesn t . he was born and raised in new york .","303187":"lol , no . we seldom argue if we have a disagreement about something , we sit down discuss it like adults and come to a mutual compromise .","303188":"that wouldn t bother me at all he would still be the same person , so it makes no difference to me .","303189":"i don t know who either of those people are .","303190":"that s why i said i try not to . not that i don t at all .","303191":"i use the restroom at work , but that s pretty much it .","303192":"lol ! ! well if it gets too much , you can always delete your original answer where you said yes .","303193":"write more often . get back into physical fitness . work on bettering myself in terms of my emotions and physical appearance . drink more water . drink less alcohol . cut down on smoking .","303194":"i watched criminal minds for the latter half of the night while drinking some beer , then minutes to midnight , i watched the ball drop with my parents while eating some cheese and crackers .","303195":"no , i generally don t ask people questions regardless of the time of year . plus i wouldn t be able to keep track of who i asked questions to if a ton of people liked my answer .","303196":"my relationship doesn t make me feel claustrophobic in fact , quite the opposite . his encouragement support have given me the freedom to truly be myself , and he s helped me learn about myself over the past years . when you find the right person , years doesn t seem like a lot , and it s all a learning experience where you both grow and evolve together .","303197":"courrtana is a close friend of mine , she s allowed to poke fun at me .","303198":"in that case , thank you for brightening my morning , even if your intentions weren t pure .","303199":"the whole new year new woman troll question was absolutely hilarious this morning . it definitely made me chuckle .","303200":"frozen ? ? lmao . i m hungover , don t me , courtney .","303201":"not at all why would that be embarrassing ? ? it s women are allowed to make more money than their partners . it doesn t equate to a person s worth .","303202":"well that s obviously minus the perishable items and dairy . it s mostly for boxed or canned goods , or things that can be freezed .","303203":"we normally buy things in bulk , that way we don t have to continuously go to the store . we usually buy enough food for two weeks at a time .","303204":"usually , i do . but this year i started in november ! ! it felt nice to not put it off until last minute , haha . i didn t feel rushed at all everything got delivered in a timely manner .","303205":"it isn t pertinent information for strangers on the internet to know , and the only people i discuss sex with are my close friends .","303206":"i try to avoid crowds at all costs , so i tend to do my shopping early on saturday or sunday mornings when the stores first open . i tend to follow the same procedure with any sort of shopping i need to do , whether it s to a clothing store or the pharmacy , etc etc .","303207":"good morning ! ! it s been a productive morning for me so far i ve already made breakfast coffee , and i finished one load of laundry . i m going to try to do as much laundry as possible today considering i have no plans at all .","303208":"i don t believe i have , no . i try not to use public restrooms to begin with .","303209":"let s ring in the new year with a bunch of thoughtful , fantastic questions ! ! i ll answer nearly anything y all send to me","303210":"i don t discuss my sex life on askfm .","303211":"no , that s gross . if i was single then i would be looking for someone older than me , not younger .","303212":"aw , thank you kittie ! ! i hope you have a happy and healthy year ! !","303213":"lol , yeah that one actually made me laugh too . happy new year ! !","303214":"aw , this is sweet . i hope you have a happy new year as well .","303215":"happy new year to you too ! !","303216":"happy new year to you too ! !","303217":"lmao . starting the new year on the right foot , i see . regardless of your opinion of me , i wish for you a fruitful prosperous new year .","303218":"brought in the new year with my boyfriend arguing with me over who loves each other more . typical . smh .","303219":"go for it . it ll be in the morning , lmao .","303220":"more times than i can count .","303221":"my boyfriend can usually tell if i m drunk , but idk if it s because i slur my words or the look in my eyes . when i m drunk , i don t tend to notice those things .","303222":"that s another reason why i absolutely hate fireworks animals are so scared and its terrible for them .","303223":"start using it . confuse all of your friends with it . incorporate it into your sex life . bock at customers waiting in lines at the store and at your coworkers . bock everything . bock","303224":"yes ! ! i talked to a person online for like six years before meeting her in person during my freshman year of college . i also met hung out with courrtana both last year and this year ! !","303225":"happy new year to you too ! !","303226":"lmao . all rightey then .","303227":"what the actual fuck is this shit .","303228":"my family always has appetizer foods and sparkling cider , but i never really partake in it at all . i m either usually out with friends or i m asleep already .","303229":"not at all . it s itchier when i do shave them .","303230":"i haven t shaved my legs in months , man .","303231":"just down natural . my hair is too short to really do anything with it .","303232":"i absolutely love that song , omg . brings me back to my teen years .","303233":"no , i m really anxious in crowds and it s never seemed worth it to me .","303234":"yeah . i absolutely hate it . they always remind me of gunshots .","303235":"all of the above ? ? lmao . tonight i m drinking it out of a can .","303236":"forgive me , i m a lil tipsy","303237":"even if she was lying , which she isn t , then why go on multiple people s pages and make a big deal out of something that s a one year difference in graduation years ? ? it s literally pointless . you can be angry at so many more important things , but instead , you choose this insignificant topic . find something else to focus your energy on .","303238":"no . one . cares . holy shit , y all get so flustered and angry over the most insignificant things . ask me questions or get off my page , man .","303239":"i wasn t planning on driving anywhere .","303240":"it s surprisingly tasty , and not sweet at all . it s a good balance of hoppy smooth .","303241":"i sent my boyfriend an ugly selfie he said i looked like a thumb , lmfao .","303242":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope the same for you as well .","303243":"mmm","303244":"yeah , it s pouring where i live too considering i live only an hour away from times square . which makes me kinda happy i didn t go out tbh , i would have hated to see how even worse drivers on the road would be due to the rain .","303245":"aw , thank you ! ! happy new year to you as well .","303246":"no . i m currently sitting on my bed , watching women behind bars , and drinking a beer with another beer waiting for me in a cooler . lmao .","303247":"psa psa psa you don t have to be an aaa member , from pm am on new year s eve day they will take your drunk self and your car home for free . save this number share it with your friends .","303248":"i understand this completely , unfortunately . i wish you all the best , recovery or at least partial recovery is extremely difficult but it can be obtainable .","303249":"there are no such things as holiday days when it comes to retail , lol . he also requested off last saturday when we went out , so he couldn t take another day the following week .","303250":"not really i ve always wanted to learn more things and i ve never been satisfied with what i know . that s why i liked attending college so much .","303251":"somewhat , but not really . i try to take each day as it comes regardless of the year , so i ll have to see what my future days offer me .","303252":"if it was a safe neighborhood , then yeah .","303253":"i don t watch cable tv , so no .","303254":"yeah , if i was really hungry at least . the cold doesn t bother me at all .","303255":"i m staying home and drinking beer and wine by myself .","303256":"sometimes , yes . my anxiety isn t as severe as it used to be , but i m still extremely paranoid and anxious if i m somewhere and its really crowded .","303257":"i ve worked hard these past few years to improve my mental health has really shown that . my mood swings aren t severe , i rarely experience depression these days and if i do they re short lived , my anxiety isn t as severe , and i ve learned to let things go instead of holding onto my anger .","303258":"lol . this is fucking great . thank you for the message .","303259":"hello ! ! happy new year to you too .","303260":"yeah , neither of my friends want to go out that s probably for the best since all of the bars will likely be packed with people .","303261":"he s turning in a few weeks .","303262":"happy new year to you too ! !","303263":"not yet at least . you re an irresponsible human being and i sincerely hope you mature and realize how dangerous your actions are .","303264":"this is getting pointless . unless you actually have something valuable to say , i m deleting the rest of your messages .","303265":"drunk driving isn t something to joke about . thousands of people have died as a result of drunk driving , and its completely avoidable if the person is a responsible individual .","303266":"? ? ? uh , my boyfriend is older than me . not sure how that would classify as pedophilic behavior .","303267":"that much is obvious .","303268":"i m guessing you ve never heard that phrase before .","303269":"how old is your sister ? ? sometimes people say things out of anger that they don t necessarily mean , especially if they re young . i wouldn t try to worry too much about it . i understand that it must hurt but keep in mind that she probably doesn t actually mean that and she ll calm down soon enough .","303270":"y i k e s you don t even know me , my dude .","303271":"that doesn t change the fact that it doesn t . lmao . i couldn t care less about what strangers on the internet think about me .","303272":"you can do whatever you want to do . it doesn t make a difference to me .","303273":"obviously you re anonymous , lol .","303274":"thanks , anon .","303275":"he ll be sleeping because he has work early tomorrow morning .","303276":"thank you ! ! i really just want to be with friends have a beer , but worst case scenario is that i hide myself in my room and drink whatever beer i have leftover from the brewery this weekend . oh well .","303277":"not really . i m trying to make plans with friends , but one isn t responding to me the other doesn t really want to go out . i really don t want to be home with my parents , but it s looking to be like that right now .","303278":"i like the aesthetic appeal of snow , but i absolutely hate driving in it .","303279":"write more often , be less critical of myself , lose weight , and spend more time with my boyfriend and friends .","303280":"i don t remember the s , and the s were a horrible time for me . i d say and beyond have been much better years than the former half of my life , personally .","303281":"i bought my family trivets for the kitchen , my brother a beard kit and a onesie , my father an echo , and my mother some soap and other various items . and i bought my boyfriend a lovebook , candles , tea , some shirts , and a sweatshirt .","303282":"if it s something you can afford , i see nothing wrong with it .","303283":"life is fine at the moment . i m currently on day three of my four day vacation , and i ve been enjoying it so far . i ve basically done nothing but play video games , sleep , and drink lol .","303284":"hello ! ! my day is going well . i just logged out of fallout for the meantime , and i might either take a nap or watch some netflix now .","303285":"a few items of clothing , fallout , some makeup , an instant camera , a few books , necklaces , and a few journals .","303286":"aw , this is so sweet . i hope you have a happy , healthy new year as well ! !","303287":"it s interesting ! ! it s a lot more customizable and you can make nearly anything without having to find it first , and you can also create ammo without buying it . we ve just been exploring so far and collecting resources to better our armor and weapons .","303288":"i m doing well ! ! i m currently playing fallout with my boyfriend .","303289":"aw , thank you .","303290":"i don t block people this is the first time i ve actually responded to that sort of inquiry it literally gets sent to me every few days , which is disgusting . i m not comparing it to severe harassment , but it is harassment if you re constantly enforcing your fetish onto unsuspecting people without their consent , especially considering i never talk about sex on my page . it s uncalled for and that person needed to be told that their behavior is unacceptable .","303291":"there s a difference between keeping a fetish to yourself then harassing random people online with your fetish . i don t care about foot fetishes up until that person starts trying to force that fetish onto me in a rude context . then it s simply uncalled for and gross .","303292":"it is disgusting , in my eyes . asking a total stranger for a picture to satisfy their gross fetish ? ? come on . you re probably the anon who sent me the original message , lmao .","303293":"happy new year to you too ! ! on that note , i hope all of my followers have at least learned something from no matter if the year was good or bad . here s to having a fruitful , prosperous .","303294":"aaahh , this is going to be my new toy . so obsessed already .","303295":"meeting mike shinoda with my best friend telling him how much his music has meant to me over the years . seeing harry potter the cursed child on broadway . seeing macklemore in concert with my boyfriend .","303296":"hell no . also , stop sending me this shit every few days . obviously your inquiries are absolutely disgusting which is why i always delete them . get some common sense leave me alone .","303297":"depends on the season sometimes i wear pajama pants a long sleeved shirt , while other times i wear a tank top pajama shorts . i just never wear socks to bed . they make me feel so restricted , lmao . i m so strictly against socks in bed it isn t even funny .","303298":"you cannot heal in the same environment where you got sick . if you truly want to progress in your recovery , you need to distance yourself from the environment which contributed to your illness whether that means a physical environment or people you surrounded yourself with . you can only progress so far until you need to remove yourself from that toxic environment , and when you do distance yourself from that environment , it s as if you re starting anew with a blank slate .","303299":"if you re pregnant with the intent of having that child , then i believe that using illegal drugs should be grounds for child abvse . it doesn t matter if the legal definition of a child doesn t include unborn fetuses at that point because the mother has full intent of bringing that pregnancy to fruitation and birthing the baby . studies have shown that using illegal drugs during pregnancy can lead to myriad illnesses in newborns , including fas , low birth weight , birth defects , etc etc . those can be directly attributed to the mother s use of illicit substances during pregnancy , and it s wild to be how that wouldnt be considered some form of abvse or neglect . however , despite all of that , i still believe that the mothers deserve professional treatment regarding substance abvse and rehabilitation . the safety of the child is the most important thing and rehabilitation of the mother is integral to giving the child the best possible life they can lead .","303300":"i don t pay much attention to other people s new years resolutions , lol . i can barely remember my own , let alone someone else s .","303301":"what are we , ? ? lmao . i haven t even heard about that game since i was in high school .","303302":"i mean . . . pretty much any game can be turned into a drinking game , in my eyes . lol . i usually play beer pong , cards against humanity , and poker .","303303":"happy new year to you too ! !","303304":"happy new years eve to you too ! ! was a weird year and i honestly don t remember much that s happened , lol . however , the best moments were probably going to see harry potter and the cursed child on broadway and seeing macklemore in concert .","303305":"probably not . i don t have any plans for tonight besides going to bed early so i don t have to hear people celebrating .","303306":"i wasn t being sarcastic in that previous answer , actually .","303307":"it s been fine . i mainly spent the day sleeping and playing video games .","303308":"i don t watch any makeup artists on youtube .","303309":"i work a regular office job on the weekdays . my weekends consist of me sleeping and cleaning and doing laundry . and in my spare time , all i really do is go on social media , play video games , and sometimes see my friends boyfriend . my life isn t very exciting .","303310":"unfortunately , i am . there are obviously parts that are a hell of a lot worse , but my town isn t exactly a safe place either .","303311":"i like cheeseburgers , but i rarely have them . i ve made them at home a few times , both beef burgers and veggie burgers .","303312":"new york is a really diverse state it depends entirely where you go , whether it s upstate or the city or long island . there are good bad parts of a lot of different neighborhoods .","303313":"no , i have a similar sleep schedule every night . i usually fall asleep between and am , and i normally wake up between and am .","303314":"none of the people i know with did have dangerous or violent alters . it s a false stereotype that s incredibly damaging to people with did and makes it that much harder for them to cope with their mental health .","303315":"i never had an interest in seeing the movie split . according to a few friends who have seen it , it completely demonizes people who have did and further adds to the stigma that those with dissociative disorders are inherently dangerous , violent people , when that couldn t be further from the truth .","303316":"there s nothing really interesting to know about me . i m essentially a boring person .","303317":"it s short for autonomous sensory meridian response . it s basically the euphoric , static like feeling you get when you see or hear something pleasing to you , or tactile stimulation like light touches on the arms or hands . there are dozens of videos on youtube of people doing things like whispering , playing with slime , popping bubble wrap , and doing other auditory things that may bring out the asmr in an individual .","303318":"no , he s bisexual .","303319":"lol . listen man , if it helps you by all means , go for it . i know that they reduce anxiety for a lot of people , but i ve never personally liked them .","303320":"we haven t had an actual argument in a really long time , actually . usually when we have a disagreement , we re both calm and try to understand each other s point of view . however , the last serious talk we had was about my drinking habit . he thinks that i drink too much while i think i agree with him , i don t think i have a problem .","303321":"they just make me feel so uncomfortable especially the whispering ones , omfg .","303322":"i guess my celebrity crushes are winona ryder hugh jackman . my boyfriend also loves hugh jackman , but he has the biggest crush on russell crowe .","303323":"i ve never cared enough to wonder about the reason why . asmr videos just irritate me for some reason .","303324":"no , it irritates me .","303325":"lol this is so true tho .","303326":"i don t pretend anything .","303327":"pretty much every week , i go through a fuck it moment . most recently , it was tonight . i wasn t planning on drinking , but i got angry , so fuck it here i am .","303328":"yeah , that happens occasionally with holidays and birthdays when it comes to my family . they have a habit of not using any of the gifts i bought them , even if they re practical , and it really angers me .","303329":"i don t even watch it on television . i hate new years eve , tbh . my parents ruined it for me because they re the type of people to use spinners and poppers and make all kinds of noise , and i m so sensitive to sounds that it makes me get sensory overload .","303330":"sounds like a comforting night ! ! i might go out tomorrow afternoon , but that s it .","303331":"i don t have plans , unfortunately . i don t usually do anything wild on new years eve .","303332":"my hobbies include writing , reading , painting , socializing with my friends usually drinking , watching true crime documentaries , cosmetics , and mental health awareness advocacy .","303333":"the only thing you asked me about was video games . lmao . i m sure i have a lot in common with myriad people . i have quite a few interests and hobbies .","303334":"yeah , gta is pretty fun ! ! i like joining my friends in a private session and just f cking around for a few hours . i haven t played gta in a long time , though .","303335":"no , i m not the biggest fan of huge multiplayer games like that . it s fun to watch but i would just end up getting angry every time i die .","303336":"well , that s what i said in the latter half of my original answer . the biggest problem would be the two people admitting their feelings for each other in the first place .","303337":"i ve never played it myself , but i watch my boyfriend play it with his friends all the time .","303338":"i don t see why not just because you re shy around other people doesn t necessarily mean you re shy around your partner . the biggest problem would be the two people admitting their feelings for one another in the first place , lol .","303339":"surprisingly , i wasn t the biggest fan of hitman . i wouldn t say it s the worst game , but i didn t enjoy it at all probably because i was terrible at it . i like watching other people play when they re good at the game , but all it did was frustrate me .","303340":"debating on cracking open a beer playing some video games . anyone have questions ? ?","303341":"oh god , lmao . absolutely terrible , that s for certain .","303342":"long island . i won t get any more specific than that .","303343":"as my bio indicates , i m from new york .","303344":"i don t discuss that on askfm .","303345":"i don t really get spam email , just promotional emails from the stores i ve subscribed to .","303346":"hell no . my breasts are already way too big for me i wish they didn t exist .","303347":"i m aware that this isn t twitter , but the verification methods are still the same . you re one among countless accounts that claim to really be selena gomez , so the chances of you being her are incredibly slim .","303348":"verification means everything when you re a public figure , otherwise anyone can say that they re you . any celebrity is normally too busy to handle several social media accounts , which is why their pr people often handle some aspects of their social media accounts . twitter is pretty much the only app where celebrities are themselves , and they re always verified .","303349":"lmao . i don t understand how you guys think you re the actual celebrity if a celeb had an askfm account which i doubt many , if any , do then it would be verified and managed by one of their pr people .","303350":"fallout and , skyrim , destiny , the assassin s creed series , the bioshock series , the halo series , life is strange and , the wolf among us , minecraft , gta v , tomb raider , and a few others .","303351":"i reached level five in fallout , so now i m going to take a nap . i don t want to progress too far since my boyfriend and i will be playing together for the first time tonight ! ! i m actually really enjoying it so far , it s always exciting to play a new game that you ve been looking forward to for a while .","303352":"i ve watched my boyfriend play , but i ve never played it myself .","303353":"i ll look into it . thank you for the recommendation","303354":"maybe ? ? i don t remember , it was years ago .","303355":"i haven t read in a while , but my favorite authors are stephen king , anne rice , george orwell , and franz kafka . i also enjoyed russian literature when i studied it in school .","303356":"your guess is as good as mine .","303357":"i mentioned this in response to tom s answer , but i think family feud is hilarious . i also love whose line is it anyway .","303358":"thank you ! !","303359":"no , if it was scary then i wouldn t have done it .","303360":"thanks , friend .","303361":"i ll look it up later . thank you ! !","303362":"yeah , half of my head is shaved .","303363":"lol . i suppose so .","303364":"thanks , friend ! !","303365":"oh , that s interesting . maybe i ll check her out see if i like her .","303366":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope you have a good day too .","303367":"isn t she a musician ? ? i ve heard the name before but i don t really know who she is .","303368":"i m so sorry you ve had to live through all of that . you seem like a genuine , kind person who doesn t deserve to live with all of this , but unfortunately we have to deal with the cards we re dealt . i hope you can afford treatment eventually , you definitely deserve to feel better regarding your bdd and other mental disorders .","303369":"idk if you wanted me to post the rest of this message , but i did read them all i m so sorry you feel this way . it truly is a struggle to deal with body dysmorphia and i completely understand how you feel . mine isn t as severe as yours , but i do experience the occasional meltdown especially if i have to try on clothing . these days , all i wear are hoodies and oversized shirts and sweaters to basically hide my body . do you see a therapist for these experiences ? ? it might be difficult to find someone who understands bdd but i think it may help if you find the right specialist .","303370":"don t worry , you re not annoying me at all ! ! i understand exactly what you mean about it being more than just insecurity it feels as if i don t even own this body , it s completely foreign to me , and i nearly go to the verge of tears every time i look at my body in a mirror unless i m wearing baggy clothing . it s terrible . that s also terrible that people have discounted your disorder due to your autism . there s so much misunderstanding about autism that its ridiculous .","303371":"the only topping i usually eat on pizza is pepperoni .","303372":"it s all good . it isn t something i ve ever brought up to my psychiatrist because i m afraid she would just brush it off as me simply being unhappy with my body .","303373":"i ve never been diagnosed with it , no .","303374":"in , i progressed a lot in terms of my mental health i no longer experience severe mood swings , my depressive episodes are nearly gone and if they do happen then they re not as bad , and i haven t taken many days off from work due to depression anxiety . i also found motivation , even if fleeting , to start writing again . i got a few journals for xmas , so in , i vow to start writing more often too .","303375":"that seems to be the most likely scenario , i agree with you . some people fetishes are absolutely wild .","303376":"yes , haha . it doesn t happen too often but i can recall at least three times in the past few months .","303377":"yes , my hair is blue now ! !","303378":"i ve answered the question in the past , but it concerns me how often this question is sent to me . lmao .","303379":"what a relaxing , snowy sunday morning","303380":"i don t care enough to be fashionable , but that doesn t mean i don t know what looks good together or put together a decent outfit . he also likes having my opinion on different things .","303381":"i ve never considered it , no . i only have two tattoos with text in them , and they re both in english .","303382":"i m not fashionable i dress for comfort . these days , i mainly wear hoodies , jeans , and boots . i can t remember the last time i actually went to a mall either . it s probably been at least years .","303383":"not quite , no . although i do admit that my unhappiness with my body is somewhat correlated with my gender , considering i have feminine features that i don t feel comfortable having . my gender dates back further than the development of my secondary sex characteristics , though . i knew from a young age that i wasn t a girl , i just didn t have a name to put to the feeling until the past few years .","303384":"i m not confused about my gender , so i don t have gender dysphoria . however , i do have body dysmorphia which is sometimes confused with gender dysphoria .","303385":"he asks me whenever we have to go out somewhere together i . e . choosing one shirt over the other , which belt shoes combo to wear that will match the shirt , etc etc . i ve honestly always thought that it was adorable . he doesn t do the same thing for me , though , lmao . i ll ask him which outfit he ll just tell me i look good in everything , which . . . isn t helpful . hahah .","303386":"i m on lamictal . i ve asked my psychiatrist countless times if drinking on this medication is okay , and she s always told me that drinking in moderation is fine , so i ve always taken her word for it . just keep in mind that sometimes alcohol can counter the effects of some medications , especially psych meds , so if you re feeling off the following day then it could be due to the mixture of the alcohol and the meds .","303387":"tips remember to drink water while drinking alcohol ! ! it s the best way to avoid getting too drunk and getting a hangover . stick to one type of drink the entire night , whether it s all liquor , all wine , or all beer . mixing it can upset your stomach . don t feel pressured to continue drinking if you think you ve had enough . tell your friend s you want to stop and drink water for the rest of the night . if you think you might get a hangover in the morning , take ibuprofen and eat a snack before bed keep a water bottle next to your bed .","303388":"why the hell did i spend an hour downloading this game last night only to wake up see that it needs another gb of additional updates ? ! this is going to take forever , ughhhh .","303389":"i don t really have one , i seldom go shopping to begin with . the last time i bought clothing for myself besides the brewery pullover yesterday was a few months ago when i was shopping in target .","303390":"i d love to hear what my boyfriend s dog is thinking , lmao . he s such a sneaky little dude , but he s also so caring and protective .","303391":"my stomach , haha . i can t stand it .","303392":"why is this pertinent information .","303393":"? ? ? how ? ? lmao . i make myself cups of water every day .","303394":"i m sure you re not the only person who feels that way .","303395":"it depends entirely on the relationship and the individual . some people are more open about their pasts while others prefer to keep it private . it seems that a lot of people like to wait a little bit to get to know their partner first before asking about their past sexual history , depending on comfort levels . there s also the idea of what s in the past is in the past and it doesn t matter anymore . so if you want to ask your partner about their history , then that s entirely up to you .","303396":"i tried to go to bed , but couldn t sleep after tossing and turning for minutes . so i decided to have a cigarette and make myself a cup of water until i get tired .","303397":"it would depend on the context of the breakup . if the relationship simply wasn t working anymore we mutually agreed to break up , then i think we could still remain friends . we re each other s best friend , after all . he always tells me how i m his best friend just as much as i m his partner . however , if he cheated on me or did something else that would completely break my trust in him , i don t think i could still be his friend .","303398":"i m not sure what their target audience is tbh . either way , that doesn t change the fact that people can use askfm as they please as long as they re not breaking any community guidelines .","303399":"i suppose my boyfriend has had the most positive influence on me over the years , especially toward the beginning of our relationship . he s the person who supported me when i tried to stop shing , and as we ve gotten older , his love , support , and encouragement has showed me ways in which to love myself ."}}
