   massages arent incest?
  ","
  Whenever I get messages about my dad ,the sender usually has that type of context going on. Which is really strange anyways to get. I believe its that Dan guy just trolling.
  
  Either way it seems odd to me. I could understand if the kid did sports or something that would warrant a massage. or say a baby burping kind of thing.
  
  But ultimately, no, I feel like that's something you learn later on in life, not because a parent gave you a massage? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  ","
  I can open or close a door myself
  
  i like the bad boys who have a softer side
  
  ""adore her only"" well hello monogamous relationship. that's why. Not everyone is into cheaters or the poly lifestyles. A guy can still have girls that are friends, I'm not jealous. He'd be with me in the end 😈
  
  respect is a two way street. Same with trust etc
  
  Priority to make the relationship actually work. I do believe that people can remain themselves and not take stock in only their happiness. again, works both ways. If neither are happy together why fucking be together!?
  
  I can't answer the treat as crap/weak part since it is more individual to the actual people. clearly they shouldn't be together if miserable with each others company. Abusive behavior isn't a good thing to have. Nobody wins.

  Lie to myself that everything is fine/im ok and hope it subsides. I've been feeling like that at the gym lately. They ended up turning spotlight type lights on above one of the machines i frequent and its just too bright for me. Makes me feel a little light headed. I need to look down and to the side instead of head on. There's mirrors there too so it makes it feel 100x even more brighter.

  ""What does my name mean"" - Lynds is just shorter/nickname for Lyndsey.
  
  I've heard something like ""camp/tent near creek"" but these were the ones that came up;
  
  Linden trees by the brook
  
  lake; a place of linden trees. From the island of the lime tree
  
  Lincoln's marsh; island of linden trees
  
  From an English and Scottish surname that was originally derived from the name of the regionLindsey, which means ""LINCOLNisland"" inOld English. As a given name it was typically masculine until the 1960s (in Britain) and 1970s (in America) when it became popular for girls, probably due to its similarity toLindaand because of American actress Lindsay Wagner (1949-)

  In general if someone unfriended me, I wouldn't send a request. Maybe ask about it to see if it was a glitch, mistake or what.. if you really didn't do anything wrong. I'm unclear of which way you meant so here's both. Clearly the friendship didn't mean much if they do that, especially with no warning.

   should there be more severe legal consequences to cyber-bullying? how can we prevent cyber-bullying from happening?
  ","
  I feel like it's more case by case. Each rule could be different. It's not one size fits all.
  
  The best thing to do is probably not have those types of people on your accounts! If ___ says a lot of crap in person then online should be the same! Get rid of negative people like that. Delete and blocking is there for a reason.
  
  You don't need to read the messages.
  
  Also I feel like some should find a backbone or just treat the people with kindness instead of getting upset over it.
  
  Obviously have all the evidence ready if they do report it.

   Does cgpa matters ?
  ","
  Not really. It just puts people against each other. It doesn't really share what the person does know. Just numbers to people. Doesn't show accomplishments. The learning style might be the wrong way for certain people. Absences and tardies can effect the grades too.
  
  For colleges and stuff gpa definitely does matter.

  I don't see why I would need to do that. When I'm in a relationship, I only have eyes for them. I'd probably limit my time going online but I don't have anything to hide. I rarely get DMs on Instagram and if I do its just normal talk, about giveaways or other stuff.. nothing sexual.
  
  I'm not someone who would rather be online than communicate with them. I'd always be in the present moment with them. Internet could wait.
  
  if something did occur then i suppose it depends on my feelings towards them.. if I'm willing to give something up then they must mean a lot.
  
  Also I feel like that kind of shows that maybe they might be the ones hiding something but putting that problem on you? seems like the typical cheating way... trust should be very important to both.

  Not really. I noticed someone who had shorts on that looked way more like underwear. I don't get how that would be comfortable. I'd be sticking to the seat of the machines.

  I ended up looking over since I thought she took the needle out but it was there still. Basically was on the verge of passing out after that. Bunch of doctors came in the room. Also had student nurses watching me from the doorway which made it even more awkward and embarrassing. it was pretty bad.. couldn't hear, vision was all messed up, cold sweats.. One of the dr ladies wrapped a wet towel around my neck.
  
  so now I need to go back again -_- thanks stupid blood lol it wasn't a fun time. besides that everything was good. Cholesterol even was. Figured that would have been one of the bad ones since bacon and other meat on keto...

   Sbg cewe, dulu lo punya tmn main (cewe) misal si H. Ga lama, si H berkhianat di blkg lo & critain ke org yg dia kenal (& lo kenal) seolah2 dia yg korban. Sisi lain,lo punya tmn cowo yg deket bgt, dan si H ini caper ke tmn cowo lo, smp si co mau aja respon & care si H & cuek sm lo. Apa action lo?
  ","
  As a girl, you used to have play (for example), for example H. It wasn't long, H's betrayed you in the club & critics to someone he knew (& you know) as if he were the victim. On the other hand, you have guys who are close together, and this guy is tired of coming to you guys, junior and co just want to respond & care for H & ignorant. What is your action?
  
  -----
  
  Did you break up and he's talking sh!t? It takes two to make a relationship work. Victim seems like a strong word if you two just didn't work out. Victim makes me think it was ab*sive or r*pe. We all have different opinions and point of views, more sides of the story. Nobody is ever perfect in a relationship.
  
  YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING GONE WRONG TO OTHERS
  
  I wouldn't talk behind someone's back. I wouldn't want to hear the stuff said if friends with both of them. It's petty and sad. I wouldn't want to pick sides. If the guy is tired of it.. why still do it? You can't always be a peacemaker. It's not your place to fix other people's problems. Maybe a little distance from them.

Hello 😊

  Do you have a real question?
  "
506745,"
   In your opinion would it be easy to solve the issue of obesity in America?
  ","
  Uh no?
  
  It could take years for people to lose weight. It's not easy and doesn't happen overnight.
  
  It could be medical issues causing the weight as well and not 100% the food consumed.
  
  America does have large portion sizes. Food has more chemicals in it than say the UK or other countries. There's more processed foods here.
  
  It's up to the individual to put their health first. Nobody is going to do it for them. Even lap band and other ""easy fixes"" don't always give you desired results. You still would suck at managing portion sizes etc You would actually want to change to get results you want.

  ","
  I do not know many subjects, and I do not know how to discuss or argue with them. I never know how to read or understand. How can I explain books or articles or anything? Thank you in advance
  
  ----------
  
  I feel like debate isn't really something that can be taught. You just know all the material on the subject. Make it clear on where you stand, what the topic entails. Mix of knowledge, facts and opinions. Knowing the who, what, why, and where of the case.. common sense plays a big role too.

I tend to push people away when I feel like I’m getting too close to someone.  
Do you think it ever gets easier to put your heart on the line and open yourself up to someone?  How would you handle a situation like this?
  ","
  Dating and getting to know someone is harder these days. Did they say or do something to make you cut them off? I guess that somewhere deep down those people weren't right for you, otherwise they'd try being there still, wanting to know why you feel distant, talk about the future. They wouldn't just accept a disappearing act?
  
  If you never think about the person again then that's fine. if you still think of someone then i would reach out again. trust your heart and the actions of the guys.

  For summer, I like coconut, cucumber melon, and other type of scents. Love suntan lotion smells XD
  
  In general:
  
  vanilla, lavender, jasmine, sandalwood, cedar, rose, sour apple....
  
  Some fruity ones are nice but I don't want it too sweet either. nice balance. same with floral ones.
  
  I've just been using tea tree oil shampoo because I like the smell, and feels like it leaves my hair nicer than other shampoos. The purple shampoo is good too.
  
  I typically like Japanese cherry blossom more in fall/winter but I was focused on using up the other ones we have. (a cherry one, honeysuckle orange, a macadamia oil)
  
  * definitely want to repurchase the cherry one. It's limited edition so not sure if that will happen. I think those are all from the softsoap brand.

   People were vegan, but at the same time it can negatively affect many people due to them not having enough options available to them. Those people shouldn't go vegan imo.

  Now... I feel drained. Good workout today. Yesterday i had 10k steps so tired from that too. The booty is feeling it. Did a pr tonight.
  
  uh, I've pretty much been to the gym all week. Taking walks. Wednesday and Thursday i ended up dancing to get more steps in (9k and 10k)  I usually do 5-7k so it was nice to meet my actual goal (9) and then excell the next day. I've also gone in the pool a few of those days.
  
  but ya, everything has been good. No complaints. Ordered stuff from Sephora and I should get it tomorrow. At first they said there was a delay then a few hours later that day, i got the shipping information.
  
  I picked a new coach for the 1stphorm 8 week challenge. My old one just had a baby and rather not add to the stress of that. It's been a good fit so far! She even made a story about my protein mug cake i made today  (her recipe + few optional steps i did) so that was cool. I feel like I'll learn a lot from her in general. She's also doing the 75hard challenge right now too.

   for your anon, what really helped me stop drinking soda and energy drinks was flavored seltzer. i love la croix and polar ice, they have them in a bunch of flavors. also like you said, putting fruit into water helps a lot too. i usually use lemons, limes, strawberries, tangerines, and peaches.

  Yes, seltzer would be a good way too. I don't think I've had Polar Ice. We do have some of those Ice drinks but I've kept away from those since a bit sweeter than I'd like.
  
  Personally, I started drinking tea and then more water. Haven't had pepsi in 11 years. Was definitely addicted to it without really noticing. The only ""soda"" I'd have would be ginger ale if I was sick.
  
  pretty much only drink water these days which is surprising lol Maybe a Zevia once a week or every other week depending on how i felt.

  plant-based foods including fruit, vegetables, grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. Vitamin D2 and D3 from lichen are vegan alternatives.
  
  cant have grains, beans with doing keto. fruit is limited. tempah is a soybean so cant have that, I already drink almond milk. can't have rice,farro, can't have whole grain pasta,

   @urlsareshittbh
  

  they make great vegan meals but at the same time I'm like ""can't have that "" either lol

  ","
  Just do it :p
  
  remember why you started
  
  know that you can't avoid it
  
  study for x amount of time then do something else, come back to more studying. it's good to take breaks
  
  take notes, study from old tests (if possible )
  
  if it's a lot of reading, make a goal on how many pages to read over. break, more reading
  
  have the room be quiet or some low soothing music if its not a distraction
  
  review everything right before taking the exam so its fresh in your mind
  
  Being tired probably isn't the best when studying though. Good luck!

  It didn't effect me in any way that you mentioned. I wasn't a drinker. Even to this day, I don't drink much. Very rarely. I've never done drugs, never got arrested. I was a good teen and usually out of the house when the parties were going on. Or I'd look after people if I was there etc

  Going out and cheating would just make the relationship even more rocky. Thoughts of not being enough. I also feel like I'd want s*x with them even less. Quite disrespectful.

507716,"
   do you think if someone was to be found guilty of domestic assault, should they also lose custody of their child(ren) ?
  ","
  I'd need more information. Not sure if you mean that the assault was on the kids or parents were fighting..
  
  Kids should obviously feel safe at home. I'd much rather have the kids live with grandparents or someone else in the family who isn't going to assault them. Foster care can be just as bad in some cases.
  
  The innocent parent should try getting out of the relationship, for their safety and safety of their children too. Should both parents lose custody? maybe not. Someone should step up.
  
  I suppose it depends how many times the assaults took place too. First offense seems wild to take away kids if it was the parents fighting. I suppose it comes down to the ages of the kids too.. how serious it was  (hospital )
  
  Every case would be different. sorry for the unclear answer lol

  ","
  This one teacher had a picture of his d!ck on his camera. The student ended up telling the principal. Bit shady since he should have only been looking at the pictures he actually needed off the camera instead of looking at everything. Likewise, the teacher should have deleted anything like that before giving to a student. Nothing came of it but the picture rumor made its rounds.
  
  This teacher shared a classroom with another teacher. We were in class and the other lady had no more classes and ended up drinking a beer. That was pretty messed up. School was still in session... I don't know if something came of that. I don't remember seeing her again but she also wasn't one of mine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I happened to check the time and noticed that. I kept chugging my water and breathing. I think I did way too much at the gym or something since haven't felt like that before. Maybe even sugar levels because I was hungry and felt fine once I ate?
  
  not sure if I didn't eat enough beforehand,  rushing through certain parts of the workouts or what ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ place was crowded tonight too ugh.

  You should love them for who they are. You could help influence them to be better  (alcohol, drugs, working out etc) but at the same time it's more based on them and their wanting to change. or having the confidence to go for that job etc

   Do you plan your meals at certain times or do you just cook and eat whenever you feel hungry?
  ","
  It just kind of happens.
  
  Breakfast is either a few hours after I wake up or straight away. Depends how hungry i am. Basically intermittent fast but not for crazy amounts of time either. I'd say about 11 hours or so? sometimes earlier. (last meal to when I wake up)
  
  Lunch can be anytime.. probably 12-4pm type thing. varies but within those times.
  
  dinner is usually 6-8pm type thing. depends when I go to the gym + get back. Tonight i went around 7ish and got back at 9. reheated the food everyone else ate.
  
  sometimes I'll add snacks in if feeling like I need something. My lunches can even be pretty snacky (deli meat, cheese, other random keto stuff)

  Others can help you to a certain extent, but you are the person who has to start and take responsibility for your life. ""God helps those who help themselves!""
  
  Do you think that the desires you feel in the depth of your heart arose by chance? However, the potential we carry in ourselves will not develop in itself.
  
  Take a step further in the path of your personal and spiritual development and start to respect yourself more in a way to allow yourself to put yourself first in your life!
  
  Be like a flame that will spread your light to everyone around you, but preserve your wax for yourself!
  
  This does not mean that you will become a person in whose heart there is no place for others, nor do you not take into account the interests of others and stop worrying about the harmfulness of your own behavior. This does not mean that you will completely ignore others' needs and desires. This does not mean that you will get away from other people in any way. It does not mean that you will love others less.
  
  It just means that everything you consider good and noble will work at another higher level because you will have more energy at your disposal and will be followed by a far greater sense of love, joy and peace!

  That was cool since mine is basically gone. I picked the same strawberry kiwi flavor.
  
  Then the next day i found out that I won the optigreens50 from a different user. I've been using it since and do see a difference with bloating and all that. Also 11 servings of veggies so that's been helpful. I do get tired of salad with keto. Nice to add more nutrients in.

  My longest has been two years. (with 2 various people/different times )
  
  I usually have long gaps between people which can be nice and sometimes very annoying/lonely.
  
  I've only broken up with one person. It was easy because we just weren't right for each other. I wanted something more real than what we *had*. But I also believe that if its real love or whatever then iy would really hurt to breakup/be broken up by that person. It wouldn't be an easy task..

  Eggs are kind of a staple with keto. I could get meat alternatives. I'd try anything once i guess. I definitely have more veggies these days  (including supplemented ones) I'd only really miss chicken.

   Idk because my friends and other youtubers are 18 and Loey is way bigger plus she had a 3x in a recent vid. Not that I'm complaining! She's still great to watch. Also I only know sarah rae and learningtobefearless and they are great! I'll check out the others too! Loey is still my top though lol
  ","
  which vid? I could understand if a bodysuit or Asian sized. Guess it depends on the brand too.
  
  I'm a 14 now and definitely would size up for bodysuits or stuff like that since I do have a long torso. I tried on a forever21 romper that I found at Goodwill and was a 0X.. It fit good but I'd probably like it better in a 1x for a bit of a loose fit.

   flour > corn anyway
  ","
  True.
  "
509183,"
   I completely agree! I'm sick of the too many paranormal stuff and wish she kept doing more hauls and such. One thing about her is idk if she's a real size 18. I don't like liars but I can't prove it. But she's super sweet and makes great clothing videos!
  ","
  Probably not. She was 14-18 before but she looks bigger now than she has. Who knows. Every size looks different on everyone. Every clothing company is different with their sizing too. I mostly felt that way when she tried the fashion nova outfits with her roommate.
  
  I feel like shaylee, Learningtobefearless, sierra, tonsofblush, sarah rae vargas and some other girls who fit that range (and smaller) are more extract with their sizes.

  Probably depends more on the individual and their needs. I guess it's hurtful if they abuse the dosage or stop taking because they ""feel better"". If you mean harmful to the inside of the body.. hard to say. Medication usually does more good in instances like that. The person shouldn't feel ashamed if they need something.
  
  No, I don't. The only meds i do take is metformin for my pcos. And sometimes a multivitamin. I should get a fish oil pill again because I feel like it helped.

I didn't have a phone, didn't know the guy driving, probably a stolen car. knew my mom wouldn't like me in a car with someone i basically just met.. so I declined. She went. Then my friend Melissa was there too and ended up staying with me instead. She'd been drinking and wasn't up for the challenge of going to Boston. We ended up chilling outside all day, talking, laughing, drinking a bit of barcadi with snapple tea mixed in. My friend was supposed to get back early but she was late. My mom was backing out of the driveway and saw us so i told what was going on since she should have been back already type thing. I was like fuck it lol my mom knows I'm not a good liar and that something was up either way. I didn't regret my decision. it's one of the best times that I spent with Melissa especially since she died in 2007.

  I don't understand the unprotected abuse... like can they not open it so went without the condom? I don't think I'd really blame a condom company for someone's stupidity of not using one when they were available. It should be their choice of bc, condom or no condom. All the ricks involved.
  
  I don't really view wearing a condom as consent.
  
  I guess the ableist people have a point ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

   His parents actually sent harry&david pears to them and my mom and I got a chocolate bunny to share from the same company. They are too thoughtful - more the mom's doing.

   @poetalunam
  

  I don't think it makes it better or worse for the individual. They just know more about themselves as a person.
  
  It's like knowing what s3xuality you are. Name, age, phone number and whatever else people remember or label themselves as. It's a part of you. You came to their page asking about a specific topic - Leigh didn't force you into asking about their life so you can't quite claim ""It's important that everyone knows I'm a type B personality"" either.

  The book went into that a little. Always needing to be right can be a bit of excuses. Whereas kindness shows more about others while helping yourself too.

   Ever seen a therapist
  ","
  Only if the high school counselor counts. We were made to see her. I didn't go to her on my own if needed it. She would have just been all ""how do you feel about that "" instead of helping with anything of real importance.
  
  I've seen her 3 times
  
  1. she was the one who interviewed me to get into the votech high school
  
  2. sophomore year with some drama by a ""friend"" which escalated into talking with our whole shop class instead. It was wicked awkward and such a joke. Even our teacher afterwards said the same. Things did get better but not because of her lol
  
  3. About college because it was demanded that we talk to her about it even though I was JUST going to community college lol
  
  4. She was also one of the supervisors for the anime club.
