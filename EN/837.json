Because we were signed to a record label at the time and our manager was based out of the uk. However, living in california and being in the la music industry just became this thing where we were left unhappy bc they were trying to change us into a band that we didnt want to be ( sex, alcohol,  drugs, dressing revealing wise and stuff). And didnt understand we wanted fun, clean, helpful and relatable music. Music with a message of hope. Positivity and love. And while we had many great experiences through that time we were left unhappy and wanted to quit music for good. Until 2015 came around and gave us an opportunity we had to react on which involved moving to nashville and going independent. Which we did and since moving their we have put out more than 2 albums, toured more than we did in la, eps and so on. Just this year has been hard on everyone and last year was as well. Our oldest sister christina was pregnant with her first child and didnt know she had a genetic thing that caused blood cots at first. She ended up loosing the baby a week before our biy tour kicked off. It was an emotional time for all of us. We wanted to push back the door but somehow even through the pain and lost christina pushed through and went forward to do the shows. At the time we also were rebranding and redoing our band and who does what in the band and looking for a graphic designer and so much more. We knew dani was leaving the band for good at the end of December after being in it for 10 years. Our youngest sister the last to join was the first to leave and it just kinda hit us unexpectedly at first but with time we found what works best for us. As for this year, christina is pregnant and due any day with a baby boy. So we didnt want to do another tour and risk anything that may cause any insufficient to her or the baby. Katherine and lisa were both engaged and planning their weddings for this year. Which katherine married at the end of may. Lisa should be by the end of this year hopefully. Katherine was busy moving into her new house with her husband. Christina has been busy preparing for the baby and the rest of us just felt with everything going on it was best to take the year off from touring or doing to much activities and projects to spend time with our family and friends and just relax a bit. Even though christina is pregnant we planned ahead and worked hard to film, record, edits etc. Content and videos for everyone.

A lot of them were good comments, talking about how I was pretty and cute and they liked my voice. Some of them were bad comments saying that I couldn\u2019t sing, or that I was annoying or boring or nothing special. This experience of being commented on by strangers has continued for the last 10 years. And it\u2019s only multiplied in size. These comments RAN MY LIFE for so long. Chasing the approval, and being heartbroken over any disapproval. Reading reading reading. Scrolling scrolling scrolling. Is it good enough? Did that come off right? Do they like me? How many likes? How many dislikes? How many views? How can I be just socially acceptable enough to not get hate but also be interesting enough to be something special? My self esteem was like a roller coaster that was tied to the unpredictable and ever-changing opinions of other people. I eventually had to realize that this is a game I cannot win. I can\u2019t please everyone and I can\u2019t get everyone to like me. I am the person who needs to like me. I need to know who I am and what I stand for and I need to be okay with what other people think of that. Because whether people love me or hate me, I\u2019m still the same. Their feelings towards me and their opinions actually don\u2019t do anything to me. They don\u2019t change my worth, they don\u2019t change anything. Literally at all. Especially since different people can love me or hate me for doing the EXACT SAME THING. This is what our new song #IAmEnough is about. You are enough regardless of what anyone else is saying about you right now. Whether you\u2019re at the top of the world, or you feel like the world is crushing you. Your value doesn\u2019t change \u2764\ufe0f\n  \n  \u201cConfidence is not \u2018they will like me.\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ll be okay if they don\u2019t.\u201d #IAmEnough go listen to it on Spotify! \ud83c\udfb6\n  ","898602":"\n  Inky ones that matter are the lads\n  ","898603":"\n  I would probably be confused and try to earn their trust to un tye me and let me go\n  ","898604":"\n  When I was younger.
