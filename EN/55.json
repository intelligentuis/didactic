Don\u2019t take the 1st opportunity and seem desperate. Have confidence and a little bit of an ego. Self esteem. Believe in yourself that you can do it. Don\u2019t give up constantly.

But I got that mask during Mardi Gras and the parades down here in Louisiana where I\u2019m from originally. I am not specifying where. I brought it here and it sits on the wall now. Are moved to Mississippi. But umm... we got up in the middle of the night to go to the restroom. On our way back into the room, we started to lay back down. As we started to lay back down, my mask on the wall is quickly lifted, disturbed and then quickly stops moving immediately.\n  \n  We had a fan on, but it wasn\u2019t pointed towards it and it does move throughout the night slightly, but I have never seen it just jolt and then it stop all the sudden? Immediately.\n  \n  Newton\u2019s law of motion did not play role in the object continuing its motion. If it has moved or was pushed or was lifted? wouldn\u2019t it have to continue its motion?

Him a skeptic, said yes.\n  \n  I said was that normal?

It is mainly distinguished by the performance venue, which might be a pub, a restaurant or a nightclub with a stage for performances. The audience, often dining or drinking, does not typically dance but usually sits at tables. Performances are usually introduced by a master of ceremonies or MC. The entertainment, as done by an ensemble of actors and according to its European origins, is often (but not always) oriented towards adult audiences and of a clearly underground nature. In the United States striptease, burlesque, drag shows, or a solo vocalist with a pianist, as well as the venues which offer this entertainment, are often advertised as cabarets.\n  ","59419":"\n  I like any honestly.\n  ","59420":"\n  Yes.

My friends mean a lot to me. I feel like friends keep your socializing and positive. I feel like everyone should have some sort of friendship and everyone does whether they realize it or not, whether it be small or large. Whether it be with an animal or human. Friendships are made every single day.\n  \n  \u2014\u2014\n  \n  What should my friend be like??\n  \n  I don\u2019t understand this question?? I mean? my friends are going to be different from any other person\u2019s friends? and your friends? because were all different, ya know?\n  \n  Unless you\u2019re meaning influential? Friends should be positive, outgoing, trustful, honest, loyal in ways, keep you out of trouble and safe, out of harms way, real, kind to you, at least partially healthy decisions both physically and mentally. Some of these aspects should be in a friend.\n  \n  \u2014\u2014\n  \n  Do I have a lot of friends?\n  \n  I mean I feel like I have a lot of friends. I have people that look up to me. I have people that I look up to. I have lots of actual friends in many different places all over the world. And then I have friends that are right in front of me. I have family from different parts of the world. And then I have family right in front of me. To me I see no difference family and friends are all family. What I am trying to say is I have people that know me worldwide, both friends and family. Honest. So yes. I would say I have quite the bit of friends. Both girls and boys. It\u2019s OK to step out of your comfort zone and explore different cultures and traditions. I feel like that makes you (us) smarter.\n  \n  \u2014\u2014\n  \n  What could be my reasons for discontinuing a friendship with a person?\n  \n  If they are negatively impacting my life or a negative influence? That could be a reason for discontinuing a friendship with that person. I can forgive people but it depends on the level of the decision... you only get one life. There are slight mistakes that could be made, possible regrets, but you only get one life? Is it really worth it? You want to live your life to the fulllist and in a happy healthy way too.\n  \n  This is a lot of questions but I guess I see why you asked them all together because they are related.\n  \n  Hopefully I can answer the questions well enough for ya.\n  ","59710":"\n  Right?

Considering I\u2019ve never been checked by a doctor on this I don\u2019t know if this is normal or not? But I feel like it\u2019s not. Can\u2019t see that well at night or in the dark at all. Sometimes my eyes adjust and sometimes they don\u2019t at all. So therefore that means I can\u2019t really drive at night. Sucks.\n  \n  I do get really aggravated easily.

If I see something out of order, I have to fix it. Not like big things, just like if a room is a little messy, I have to try to tidy it up a bit. If I don\u2019t do it, then I tend to get really upset and little anxiety comes in.\n  \n  I mean it\u2019s not like I am psycho and trying to kill people?

No problem though.\n  \n  ___\n  \n  I\u2019m going to answer it saying the closest person to me would have to be my best friend Jason. We literally 100% adore one another. We trust and get along so well. We literally are inseparable. We live really far away from each other but we still somehow seem inseparable. We\u2019re always communicating, calling one another, texting, Skyping, whatever! We are together. We always want to know what the other one is doing (in a good way) because it just simply infatuates us. We never leave a day untouched without including one another in it.\n  \n  Everything I\u2019ve ever done he just thinks is beautiful, everything, in every way. And everything he does is just great! and is the greatest! He\u2019s just so smart! It\u2019s crazy! I love it! He\u2019s handsome as hell and strong! He\u2019s literally my everything, my best friend. He says I\u2019m the only person that understands him truly. We just understand one another fully, honestly. We have been together for five years almost and I don\u2019t regret a single day being with him. He\u2019s the best person in the world to me. He is kind to me. He knows good people. He takes care of me. I care for him. Protects me and wants the best for me. I don\u2019t think I could honestly picture a day without him and without him I don\u2019t know what I would really do. Life without him would be quite empty.. He is the closest thing to me. \u2665\ufe0f Jason\n  ","60023":"\n  I have found $100 on the floor at the store I work at.

I was happy that I found the person it was for. Because they were able to get their groceries.\n  \n  How did I know it was for them? because when they went to get their money they said that they had $100 and that it was gone. They knew nothing about the hundred that I found. So obviously it must\u2019ve been for them and it happened right after I found the hundred. So I went back to the lost and found and I gave it to them.\n  ","60024":"\n  I mean they (the questions) could be anything. Anything to what they like? or to what they like to do maybe? Their favorite things? What\u2019s their hobbies? Biggest fears? What they can\u2019t stand? You can ask him anything almost. The problem is when asking questions, you don\u2019t wanna get too detailed with the questions. People get personal and nosy. You don\u2019t want to ask the person like... for example.. What street do they live on in the state that they live in? Or you don\u2019t ask them where they live in the intentions of going there. Unless of course it is consented by that person, and that it is OK for you to go to that location. There\u2019s nothing wrong with someone being interested in another person, BUT before you actually let it be known, check out the person\u2018s profile, their bios and just find out more information before asking questions, look at the basics. People forget these extra things that are there. They tend to not care, are lazy, don\u2019t look and so forth. When someone obviously looks like they are in a relationship or are married, don\u2019t interrogate them with questions and intention of being interested in them. Does that make any sense? Just common courtesy.\n  \n  I\u2019m not talking about you. Like I\u2019m not saying this to you.
