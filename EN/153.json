If you buy a bird that way, from a breeder who really knows parrots and has an avian vet and knows what goes into hand feeding, then you're going to get a very docile companion bird. If you go to petsmart and buy a parakeet, you're probably going to have to work very very hard to win it's trust. But, it's possible. I really do recommend not supporting petsmart and petco and the like for that sort of thing though, parrots are very complicated creatures and a specialized breeder is the way to go.\n  ","164526":"\n  yup she was part of a 5-bird clutch I was the first to pick one out of them and I picked Bubo because she was the most active\/had the brightest eyes because let's be real baby birds are kinda funny looking it's hard to guess what they'll grow up to look like lol I was just going for \"healthy\"\n  ","164527":"\n  If it got to a point where I didn't need her company, or I was feeling so well for a stretch that I took a part time job, or something like that, then yes.

She nipped at her brother and sister's feet (and she nips at mine too, still lol) and she attacks a mirror most of the time (sometimes she's just a curious girl) She likes to mimic the sounds of other birds in boarding when I've taken vacations but no one there has ever told me one way or another if she interacts with them past that.

All I know is I started smoking right after I found out about them, because I was also struggling with PTSD flashbacks at the time and my psychiatrist was like, dude smoke some weed here's a letter of recommendation. But then, those bitches started SHRINKING and I was like whattttt so now I'm pro weed for all ailments. it's helped my glaucoma\/optical nerve pressure go down and stay regulated, it eradicated ptsd flashbacks, it made my boob tumors shrink, I sleep better, I have a healthier appetite, I feel more active and creative because it helps relieve some of my negative schizophrenia symptoms. When I can't smoke, like when I'm travelling to states where it's not legal, I take hemp\/CBD oil which IS legal everywhere and it's just as helpful though maybe not with sleep and appetite because those are THC things.\n  ","164630":"\n  you'd have to ask a meteorologist about that.

The air here is very clean and it's very green and fresh, we get amazing vegetables and fruits year round and there are tons of nature and cultural opportunities.\n  \n  However it's very white.

You've gotta understand the amount of sheer disgusting garbage that people send out through anon messages\n  ","164643":"\n  so usually when people send me something like this, it's because it's something weird, sexual, and fetishy. I'm not cool with that.\n  ","164644":"\n  yeah of course. It doesn't help that my best friend in high school was also a smoker so we just sort of owned it. and my mentor was a nihilist and was like \"you need a vice, good for you\" so honestly there was a lot in my life that really WANTED me to be a smoker at the time lol.\n  ","164645":"\n  lol thanks dude\n  ","164646":"\n  my mother gave me my first cigarette.

There are two main components to what people smoke and those are THC and CBD. Each has a slew of medical benefits, but the only things I really depend on THC for are muscle relaxant, easing me through flashbacks, and because being high is fun. So I think that if I'm careful not to trigger ptsd and I just use my prescription muscle relaxers that I almost never use instead I'll be good with just the CBD (in this case it's been harvested from hemp which doesn't even contain THC at all so it's legal in America)\n  \n  CBD helps my inner ocular pressure (I have glaucoma), has reduced my breast tumors, is an antipsychotic, helps relieve anxiety, helps relieve pain, helps relieve my negative symptoms of schizophrenia.\n  \n  There's a lot of shit out there saying that you shouldn't smoke if you are schizophrenic but the truth is, it's very very good for schizophrenia. The concern initially was that exposing yourself to THC at a young age (teen years or earlier) might trigger psychotic episodes but there really hasn't been any evidence supporting that at all and in fact some studies have been done to show that any paranoia caused by THC can be sort of cancelled out by a good amount of CBD. So I hate seeing that information spread around, it's saved my life and helped me feel \"normal\" for the first time.\n  \n  So I might stop smoking it, to answer your question, one day, because concentrates seem like the future and I do want to take a break with just the oils for a week or so. But I'll probably never give up CBD because I feel like it's really turned my health completely around. THC I don't really want to give up but I may in spurts.\n  ","165053":"\n  During psychotic periods of time I've been very distrustful and angry towards my husbands friends.
