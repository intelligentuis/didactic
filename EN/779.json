feeling every part of your body sinking into the mattress knowing that you don t have to do a damn thing for a few hours . oh man .","721329":"football","721330":"money","721331":"i have two !

one was bomb . i designed it myself . i miss it .","721334":"well i certainly think that this is a wide answer . people have vastly different values . for me , having my family be financially secure while also finding a healthy balance of spending time with one another are top shelf important to me .","721335":"in certain situations .","721336":"that depends on if my future events would turn out pretty much the same . like , i don t wanna go into the past , change a small ass thing and then end up never having my son .","721337":"don t just say you wanna be better . start off small , don t

because after minutes you gave me your number i already had your mailbox full ?","721357":"less respectful , less educated , less patient . i don t necessarily think people have become more sensitive like everyone is saying . people have a platform now . the internet . anybody can say anything they want . before , people would just talk shit alone or to their like minded friends and usually keep quiet to those outside of their circle . the internet has totally messed with people s heads . giving the ignorant the chance to spread hate and troll if you will . however , the internet has also connected people from around the world , formed bonds and communications that were otherwise unheard of unless you had money to travel . it has also help spread awareness for causes and helps everyone get a better understanding of what s really happening in this world . it s the best and worst invention in history . in my opinion of course .","721358":"that made no sense in my google translate .","721359":"that all depends on if they re nice or not","721360":"yes","721361":"dinner and a movie . i m sorry , it s just dumb .","721362":"i m sick . yay .","721363":"gym is lit

it was a thing","721397":"no flowers . flowers die . give a girl something she can hold onto for a long time . chicks love blankets and shit . but i guess a lot of girl like flowers though . . . so idk roses ? if i m getting plant life i like cacti and succulents . they last a long time and you don t have to worry about the constant attention . i have other more important things to do than worry about keeping a plant flowers alive .","721398":"if you re talking about my story , it was my cousin . she would isolate herself after she met these men . sometimes we didn t hear from her for years . i think if she was looking for sympathy , she would have stuck around us to spill all the tea . truth is , she was dealing with some inner demons having low confidence about herself . that can equal disastrous results . if you re talking about your friend , it sounds a lot like munchausen syndrome which is what gypsy rose blanchard s mother had . google her if you don t know who i m talking about . if she is always talking about it and needing that attention , she needs therapy .","721399":"that all depends on how many people are in the theater , who i m with , etc . i usually like to sit in that front row of the middle , where the metal bars are so i can prop my feet up . if i m with a friend , i let them choose where they want to sit .","721400":"this is a hard one . i have a son luckily he s a toddler for now i also had a family member who had been married times . she only had kids from of the men however . but all of the men she was married to were abusive . she literally couldn t catch a break . she s since passed away about years ago . so i think i d go into that situation if it arises with a different perspective , i would however let my son know to be cautious . . . . in a lot of situations it is the woman who has the problem , but i would also encourage him to try and get her side of the story . i d also suggest he look into her more . . . i mean we have the technology . i know that when i would go out with guys , i would make sure i d look them up first social media , etc to try and get a sense of them , their friends , family , personality , etc . i think everyone should do that . you never know these days .","721401":"i favor cats . but i love dogs too ! !","721402":"laundry dryer sheets . since our washer and dryer is in our bedroom !","721403":"no call no show where ? i got no where to be tomorrow ! i d get my money and","721404":"i really don t like either . i like face to face interaction . if i had to choose , i d say , texting . even though the emotion isn t there , besides emojis i get time to think about what i m going to say .","721405":"no thank you please . this chick has made a tumblr and dedicated her time and energy on someone who doesn t give two shits about her ? yikes . the few pieces i did read i felt bad , he treated this chick like shit . seeing as how there are billions of people in this world , there are going to be a lot of shitty ones in it . that s sucks she didn t come forward with the physical harm , i can relate to that . but making a whole damn page about her shitty exes ? i saw there was another ex she wrote about but didn t feel like diving deeper . maybe she needs to stay single for a while and figure out how to be a stronger individual . i was in a string of shitty relationships and i had to eventually stop and learn to love myself before i could love someone else . when you accept abuse of any kind from anyone , that s some deep mental thoughts that subconsciously tell you that that s all you deserve . i recommend a therapist and some time alone to reflect .","721406":"i d have to go to the doctor to confirm this . but on the way i d call a couple people to let em know what s up . if i really only had that short of time , not much i could do . i think i d try to go to sleep maybe sedatives ? so i wouldn t die while i was awake . just seems like the logical option .","721407":"pay off my debts , buy property , invest , buy my father a house , donate all my old clothes and buy new ones . etc etc etc","721408":"i m not affiliated

what . . . .","721412":"dna test help clear that up . if you are the father and don t feel like paying for something you helped create , sign away your parental rights . if you are the father , want to keep your parental rights but don t want to pay to support your child s wellbeing , yikes . maybe you aren t mature enough to have sex since you can t take responsibility for your actions . accidents do happen . you need to be prepared . if you are the father , want to keep your parental rights but don t have the money , do your best ! if you aren t the father , you have nothing to worry about . . . keep living your life ! however , if the situation is switched and the father is taking care of the child , unless the mother signs away her parental rights , she needs to pay that child support . remember , it takes two to tango . aka it s both of your responsibilities when y all fuck .","721413":"javier suarez","721414":"the fuck ? ! it is alive and well ! i am a writer and a poet .

biggest mistake was wearing one once to a club . you never realize how drunk you are until you get into a bathroom stall alone . . especially with a romper , trying to get the damn thing off without losing your balance and before peeing on yourself .","721441":"i like rompers . they come with pockets ! a lot of them do but bloody difficult when you have to use the bathroom .","721442":"when i m
