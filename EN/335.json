gaming in general . lately i ve been preoccupied with destiny , but i m also a big fan of skyrim , fallout , the bioshock series , the assassin s creed series , and tomb raider , among other games i download .","309885":"my ability to persevere through all of the struggles i ve endured . despite my upbringing , mental illnesses , and bad habits , i ve managed to complete school and be successful thus far in my career .","309886":". i never learned how to ride a bicycle . . despite my depression in high school , i obtained straight a s and was accepted to every college i applied to . . i prefer rainy days over sunny days . . i m intrigued by true crime , serial killers , the paranormal , and unsolved mysteries . . i spend my days off playing video games .","309887":"i think everyone is unique in their own respect , but there at definitely others who stand out from the rest especially those who are gifted or creative or more bold and daring than the general population .","309888":"thank you i m getting it cut and colored on tuesday in preparation for the wedding , actually .","309889":"if you re not hitting on someone of the same sex or find someone of the same sex to be sexually or romantically attractive , then no , you re not bi or a lesbian . the reason why you re upset is because you re a decent human being who recognizes that those who are gay get treated poorly in society .","309890":"i can already afford my treatment , so having more money wouldn t really affect the treatment i m currently receiving . i m already seeing my therapist once per week and my psychiatrist times per month .","309891":"it s entirely possible , but it wouldn t be the truth . i care about money to the extent that i need it to pay my bills , but other than that , it doesn t make much of a difference to me .","309892":"if someone wants to have my mental illnesses , i ll be more than happy to give them away if it means i won t have them anymore . the only person i m ever competing with is myself tbh .","309893":"i m happy that she sought out what she needs best for her life . everyone has different needs , though , so money can affect some relationships and not others . i never disagreed with you over the fact that money is a factor in some relationships , but it doesn t define all relationships .","309894":"i m thankful that i do . i have love and support from my boyfriend and my best friend , which is basically all i need .","309895":"if it s not a big deal , then why bother pointing it out in the first place ? i could have pointed out your grammar , but it isn t a big deal to me so i left it alone .","309896":"considering i have multiple mental illnesses , i feel that way on a daily basis .","309897":"i m excited to start a new phase of my life , but i m also nervous . i m anxious for the commute there and back , and i m also nervous about starting out in a new place and having to climb the ranks again .","309898":"a phoenix or cerberus ! !","309899":"lol omg . that s hilarious . ? ? ?","309900":"i ve been beating myself up over the last job interview i had because i ended the interview with an awkward handshake . i turned around and instead of shaking hands using my right hand , i accidentally cupped the manager s hand with my left hand . they never called me back and i ve convinced myself that it s the reason why . ?","309901":"my current company is laying off of its employees in december , so i ve had no choice but to find a new job . i also wanted to find a new job before my insurance expires in november so that i could apply for health insurance as soon as possible . as for my new job , i m going to be doing editorial work for a publishing company .","309902":"yes . my last day of work is tomorrow , and i start a new job on the rd of october .","309903":"i only have perhaps or true friends , and they would remain regardless of what happens . i tend to keep my inner circle really small because i don t trust most people , and these friends have proven their love and loyalty throughout the years .","309904":"probably because i said happy national coming out day and they thought i meant that it was a federal holiday or something wacky like that . i always take this anon s messages with a grain of salt because they re always offended by what i say and the only insults they come up with is calling me a snowflake and alleging that i plagiarize my own answers .","309905":"even though it s not an official holiday doesn t mean that people can t celebrate it for what it is to deny that it exists is just plain silly . as for how i answer my questions , i can assure you that none of my answers are plagiarized if you can t accept that for what it is , then that s not necessarily my problem .","309906":"i never said that everyone s a little bit gay i just said that i was gay , considering it s national coming out day and i don t advertise my sexuality at all . i agree with you , though you can appreciate women without being sexually attracted to them obviously , they re two completely different spectrums .","309907":"i agree . and hopefully his father does accept him for who he is i can t even fathom the thought process someone goes through when deciding they re not going to treat someone the same simply because their friend or family member came out as gay .","309908":"i think it s sad , tbh . a lot of people require mental health treatment but ultimately go without it due to the expensive cost of psychiatry visits , medication , talk therapy , hospitalizations , etc etc . even with insurance depending on your insurance company the cost of taking care of your mental health can be taxing .","309909":"tbh half of them are inactive or rarely come on askfm anymore . i don t like my feed being crowded .","309910":"my apologies , should i have specified it to mean sexually and romantically attracted to people of the same sex and varying genders ? you anons are so nit picky , damn .","309911":"apparently when you like people of your own sex and of varying genders , you re not gay . interesting . ?","309912":"happy national coming out day , everyone . just a reminder , i m gay as fuck . also a psa don t shame people for not feeling comfortable coming out to their friends and family . you never know what situation a person may be in and whether or not it will be detrimental to their well being . come out at your own pace .","309913":"no , thank you . i only follow a minimal number of people .","309914":"i think i remember hearing about this story briefly . i don t think it s fair at all he shouldn t have any rights to that child because it was non consensual sex and that girl shouldn t have to see her rvpist all of the time because it only raises the risk of it happening again .","309915":"i currently make more money than he does , but it s never been a source of argument because we act on the thinking that our money can be shared , so if i fall on hard times , he helps me out , and vice versa .","309916":"no , that s not how the facility works . i would have to pay out of pocket for whatever their services would cost without insurance .","309917":"i understand this completely i m going to be without insurance soon and i m going to have to delay my mental health treatment until i can get insurance again because the cost of seeing my psychiatrist , taking my medication , and talking with my therapist would be outrageous .","309918":"i ve attempted to destroy myself plenty of times in the past this is no different . someone s intelligence isn t directly correlated with their bad habits , because most people who engage in harmful activities know exactly the risks involved .","309919":"i used to go to the gym a few months ago three times per week , but i ve recently fallen out of the habit due to job searching , wedding planning , family obligations , etc etc .","309920":"i honestly don t remember the last time i got a cold but i usually treat it with extra bedrest , drinking plenty of water , and getting vitamin c .","309921":"why bother trying to convince me when you re just an anonymous person on the internet whose opinion doesn t matter ? i understand you probably have a reason for disliking cigarettes , but it s useless to enforce that opinion on people who clearly don t care .","309922":"you re a good candidate for coming up with better insults .","309923":"high taxes , horrendous gang activity , and overpriced cigarettes .","309924":"i initially have panic attacks over confrontations because i m terrified that the person is going to abandon me , so i usually try to sort them through as soon as possible so that the fear is quelled .","309925":"i don t really pay much attention to actors and actresses anymore . however , growing up , i had the hots for angelina jolie and drew barrymore .","309926":"i wished that all of the time when i was younger , but i was too afraid to say anything due to the repurcussions of my words .","309927":"alternative rock , hip hop , metal , indie , classic rock , and classical .","309928":"not at all . i love him for the person he is now . if i expected anything greater from him , then i simply wouldn t be with him at all . as a general rule , though , i don t judge people based on their race or how much money they have . it s never been important to me .","309929":"ah , thank you so much","309930":"it s too long to post here , so here s my facebook rant about world mental health day well it s not so much of a rant as it is a public broadcast to raise awareness","309931":"about a year ago . my teeth have always been fine then again , i don t smoke as often as most other smokers , so it s difficult to compare my health with those of other smokers .","309932":"when i started dating him , i was an extremely guarded person because i was hurt so often in the past due to other relationships . i didn t really expect the relationship to last very long because we began dating a few months before i moved to massachusetts for college . however , we both persisted at the long distance relationship and i was amazed at how much effort he was putting into making sure we talked every day , and he was there for me completely when i began dissolving into a severe depressive episode . it was during that time that i fell in love with him because he showed me support and understanding and persistence that i ve never experienced before .","309933":"i suppose i got carried away when i started dating my boyfriend . after all , i did fall in love with him eventually and our relationship has worked through the present day .","309934":"i took this photo on halloween weekend back in when i was in upstate new york . i absolutely love the colors of the leaves and the tranquil nature of the photo . it reminds me of the trip i took and how much fun it was to walk through the woods in the heart of autumn .","309935":"i had the flu pretty terribly once a few years ago where i was pretty much confined to the bathroom for days on end . i was so weak and dehydrated that i should have gone to the hospital , but i stupidly didn t go . i literally didn t have the strength to get off the ground . i don t know how i recovered , but i remember it took a few days and a lot of forcing water and bread down my throat .","309936":"i haven t paid any attention to it , tbh . i know he was accused of sxxual harassment and got fired , but that s pretty much all i know . if it s true , though , then he s obviously a piece of shit .","309937":"i ve been trying to preoccupy myself with household tasks and video games in order to forget about the anxiety about it being my last week at work and starting a new job soon . i know this is a step in the right direction for me , but i still feel overwhelming anxiety about it all because i m afraid that i ll be unhappy . however , i m heading to my boyfriend s house tonight so hopefully that distracts me enough .","309938":"i wholeheartedly agree .","309939":"i don t have time off of work yet my last day at my current job is this friday . i only have today off because it s columbus day .","309940":"people with strong , bold personalities people who aren t afraid to voice their opinions and embrace their individuality with full force . my boyfriend is one of those kinds of people . he has strong opinions but only offers them if asked . he likes playing the devil s advocate to challenge other people s opinions . he s not afraid to tell people his honest feelings , and he s well aware of how weird and geeky he is and embraces it completely .","309941":"my new job starts on the rd of october , allegedly . they want me to start next monday but it was extremely short notice and i don t think i ll be able to start that soon .","309942":"you ll have to be more specific . which aspects of my opinions are inaccurate , and how does that make me a spineless person ? because right now , your words are empty and meaningless without justification .","309943":"don t trust people just because they re offering you something you need at the time . when i was younger , i was naive enough to trust certain people because they were giving me something i wanted , and i thought they had my best interests in mind . it turns out they were just using me to advance their own gains , so i immediately cut them out of my life . these days , it takes a lot of time and effort for someone to gain my trust because i don t trust in other people s motives .","309944":"unfortunately , that s a common side effect of depression unwavering loneliness , regardless of the support system behind you . even though i ve had support throughout the years , i still have moments where i feel desperately alone and as if no one understands and nothing will get better . depression is an isolating disorder because it makes loneliness feel like your only friend and forces you to distance yourself from people who actually care about you .","309945":"i d rather just be myself , whether that means i m blending into the crowd or standing out from the crowd . i ve always found it difficult to define myself , but i ve always sought to live my life on my own terms rather than live my life according to what society expects of me . as a result , there are some aspects of me where i do blend in , but i also stand out in other aspects too . it s difficult to really define .","309946":"i m a sensitive son of a bitch , so a lot of movies have made me cry , lol . the only one that comes to mind right now is the notebook . the first time i saw that movie , i ugly cried for a very long time .","309947":"i believe in the paranormal , like ghosts and spirits and whatnot . i ve had a few experiences with ghosts that solidified my opinion , as there was no other explanation for the things i saw . i also really enjoy watching paranormal shows . i think some of them are exaggerated , but they re interesting to watch .","309948":"i m not self centered at all , and most of the time , i actually hate myself , lol . my life mainly centers around my friends and boyfriend . however , i ve also been trying to do things for myself as well because my therapist has been teaching me the value of self care and kindness .","309949":"i m fairly honest with myself , so there s nothing i m pretending not to know . it s better to be aware of your environment and relationships instead of living in denial . you re not doing yourself any favors by refusing to acknowledge if there s a problem in your life .","309950":"that s not weird at all , and in my opinion it s actually normal i do the same exact thing because i m paranoid that people will be looking into my window and watching me , so i close the shade every night .","309951":"i think my answers are generally the same whenever you ask this question because my interests don t really change much over time . i like receiving personal questions most of all questions about mental illness , my relationships and friendships , my education , career , opinions , passions , life goals , etc . the only questions i don t answer are ones pertaining to my trauma , my family , and anything sexually based .","309952":"i m sure that s actually quite common , actually . mental illness often goes undiagnosed because a lot of people have a lack of insight into their own mental health due to a lack of education about illnesses . in the same vein , i m also sure there are thousands of people who refuse to accept the fact that they have a mental illness due to the stigmas surrounding them or their belief that being mentally ill is a weakness of character .","309953":"i ve had my past held against me plenty of times . i used to do a lot of dumb shit with my friends and manipulated people for the fun of it , and it was a pretty terrible thing for me to do . there are some people who still judge me for what i did and hold it against me , and to be honest , i don t blame them at all .","309954":"somewhat , but not really . i didn t make any plans because i have a lot of laundry to do and some household chores to take care of throughout the day . today was my day to relax and have fun . my boyfriend had off from work , so we spent last night through this afternoon together .","309955":"i judge myself every day it correlates with my self esteem issues because i judge myself for not doing anything in my life to better myself despite being unhappy with a myriad of things .","309956":"my neighborhood is anything but closely knit , and we live our lives without knowing who the other people are or what they do with their lives . i live in a populated town , so it s not as if it s a small community of people who all know each other .","309957":"all nature is beautiful to me i d take living in the mountains over living in a city any day . i m surrounded by beaches and forests , so naturally i love those aspects of nature . however , i do have a strong appreciation for mountains and lakes .","309958":"i usually gravitate towards psychological thrillers , autobiographies , and fantasy novels . i just finished one of my favorite books called i am not a serial killer by dan wells , and its a good crossover between fantasy and thriller . i highly recommend it .","309959":"i can barely envision myself having a newborn or a toddler , let alone a teenager , lol .","309960":"i don t think we would have the same kind of relationship as we do now if i knew he didn t see marriage in the future . it probably wouldn t change my feelings towards him because i can respect that decision marriage isn t for everyone but the nature of our relationship probably wouldn t be the same as it is now .","309961":"my boyfriend s batman tee shirt and pajama pants . it s a lazy sunday","309962":"thank you so much ! ! ? it s definitely a step in the right direction , that s for sure .","309963":"it s located about minutes away from my home , so it isn t very bad of a commute .","309964":"it s an editorialist position for a publishing company ! ! and yes , it actually pays much better than my current job .","309965":"if people obtain guns legally , then there won t be much of a difference in the amount of guns owned legally because those people won t feel pressured by the screening process of owning a gun . if a gun is stolen , then it doesn t matter the process someone went through to obtain it . it s still stolen .","309966":"haha , yes . with the exception of one year that i spent in massachusetts for college .","309967":"gender identity is recognized by scientific communities , and i don t even use tumblr . this was a nice try at an insult , but it failed .","309968":"they re all adorable . i ve gotten to the point where i find newborns to be cute , but if someone hands me a child , i have no idea what to do with them .","309969":"thank you ! ! ?","309970":"trust , understanding , and the ability to have fun . you can t hold a proper relationship if you don t trust your partner , and in order to have effective communication , there must be a degree of understanding between you and your partner . in addition , your partner should be your best friend . you should be able to talk to them without judgment , have fun with them while doing the simplest of things , and know that they ll be there for you through times of struggle .","309971":"i have a strange obsession with blood and gore that neither my friends nor my boyfriend share or understand . i love incredibly graphic films .","309972":"i would like to get married , yes . however , i m hesitant on children because i don t like children or toddlers very much , and i can t see myself as a parent yet . perhaps in another few years when i m older and more mature , my mind will change . but as of now , i have no plans of having a child .","309973":"i disagree . there have been studies which show that implementing the death penalty is more costly than keeping a person in prison . you can read more about it here https deathpenaltyinfo . org costs death penalty","309974":"non binary means that a person s gender is not defined by one of the either binary genders , which is man or woman . because gender exists on a spectrum , people who are non binary feel as if they re somewhere in the middle of that spectrum in that they cannot be properly defined as a man or as a woman .","309975":"some of my beliefs are women should have the option to choose abortions . marijuana should be legalized taxed , and medical marijuana should be more accessible for medical conditions . the death penalty should be eradicated . birth control should be covered by insurance companies . there are an infinite number of genders , as gender exists on a spectrum .","309976":"social progress is essentially the idea of what people and corporations can do to further improve society in terms of politics , the economy , the environment , equal rights , etc .","309977":"i find that people already have their pre conceived notions and belief systems , and it seems as if in modern day feminism , there are some people who use feminism as a scapegoat and use it to propel their own beliefs , regardless of how problematic they are .","309978":"it seems as if people would rather talk about feminist principles on social media instead of going out to marches , rallies , etc . , to actually make a difference . there are a select few individuals who are so committed that they do go out to make a difference , but the majority of people don t do that .","309979":"thank you so much , i am freaking out .","309980":"i just got a job offer , oh my god .","309981":"considering anonymous people are strangers , i ll have to go with a resounding no .","309982":"i don t see how your opinion is supposed to influence me in any way , shape , or form . tbh this seems to be more of a you problem than a me problem .","309983":"as my bio clearly indicates , i am years old .","309984":"i forgot that anons know more about my friendships than i do , silly me . i guess all of our conversations are solely due to me feeling sorry for tal instead of because i consider her to be a genuine friend . ? cc princess tal","309985":"childhood trauma . i won t get into more specific details than that , but it has had a devastating effect on my mental health and the way i perceive relationships and the world .","309986":"my empathy and willingness to help others . i have a tendency to become invested in other people s issues if they re comfortable enough to ask me for advice , and i often get positive feedback on my involvement and concern for their lives .","309987":"it annoys me when people micro manage me because it makes me feel suffocated and judged for what i m doing . it also increases the pressure on me to do well , which causes me to overthink situations and assignments and screw up more often .","309988":"probably the people whose pages i check the most and genuinely enjoy their answers , such as princess tal , lakocis , courrtana , dovbts , my name isnt eric , and littlerouge .","309989":"those type of people are total buzzkills , haha . i try not to say anything about a tv show or movie until my friends have seen it because it sucks knowing what the plot twist is before you even watch it yourself .","309990":"other people s sex lives shouldn t be your concern , and it s disheartening to hear that you re so invested in someone else s life someone who probably means nothing to you to the point where you re judging the content of their character based on their sexual history . i wouldn t necessarily call you a bad person , but i do believe you need an attitude adjustment . men aren t entitled to treat women like garbage just because they may have had an extensive sexual history . if you genuinely believed in gender equality , then you would treat these women with the same respect you would treat reserved women .","309991":"i would wish for a large sum of money to come my way so that i could fulfill my dream of moving out of my parents house into my own home with my boyfriend down south .","309992":"no , that s not true at all your sexual history won t matter to the right person who walks into your life , and you re going to know eventually who that person is and what they mean to you . you won t feel the need to sleep around anymore and you ll be satisfied in that relationship .","309993":"i m always honest .","309994":"so far , so good . it s been an incredibly busy few weeks since autumn began , and i m hoping it calms down soon . i m happy that the weather has been chillier , though ! i can t stand the heat , so the past week or so has been pleasant . my boyfriend and i had a fire with some brews the other night , which was fun and relaxing .","309995":"i either love my appearance or i hate my appearance , depending on how i feel that day . i haven t been happy with myself lately , and i ve really been debating on shaving my head .","309996":"even though i m sure you already follow

who is neither a fat boy or a fuck boy .","309998":"i usually ingest absurd amounts of caffeine .","309999":"psychology , sociology , and anthropology especially forensic anthropology . they re all subjects that i took elementary classes on while i was in college , but unfortunately i didn t have the time to pursue them further . it would be interesting to delve further into those studies , in my personal opinion .","310000":"circumcision is inhumane and shouldn t be performed on infant boys . it s a savage procedure that is medically unnecessary and is unrightfully performed on an infant who cannot consent to the activity .","310001":"mental illness is not directly correlated with violent behavior , and those who are mentally ill are not , in fact , more likely to commit violent crimes compared to non mentally ill people . society needs to stop associating violence with mental illness , and the media needs to stop portraying criminals are misunderstood loners with mental illness .","310002":"my relationship ! ! i feel as if we re closer now than ever before , which is comforting because he s part of the reason why my mental health has been improving lately . he s such a strong , reliable support system and he would walk to the end of the earth for my happiness . i honestly feel so lucky to have found a partner who s genuine , empathetic , and patient enough to try to deal with and understand my mental illnesses .","310003":"my co workers . they always have such amusing , intelligent conversations and the banter that exists among them all makes me laugh so hard sometimes .","310004":"the prospect of losing my job and my health insurance at the same time . it s why i ve frantically been job searching the past few weeks , as my health insurance runs out in november and i need to enroll in a new insurance plan in order to maintain my psychiatry appointments and afford my medications .","310005":"friendships can t be forced , so no .","310006":"i catch people doing that occasionally , but i don t usually react at all . there s no purpose for me to give them a reaction , so i just continue doing whatever i was doing .","310007":"con he has got it all the looks the body the smarts . i feel he s only with me because he doesn t want to hurt my feelings . i don t know what he sees me , he can get someone better than me . am i being weird for thinking this ? any tips how i can overcome these thoughts trust me , i understand completely how you feel . my boyfriend is the same way he s good looking , intelligent , and charming so it s hard for me to really believe that he chose me out of the pool of available people . he always tells me that i m attractive , but i honestly don t see it and i disagree with him . however , that doesn t mean your boyfriend doesn t love you or feels sorry for you . often our perceptions of ourselves are different than reality , and everyone has different taste . he probably genuinely feels that way towards you , but because you can t see it , you think that he can t be telling the truth . you have nothing to worry about , friend . i m sure your relationship is genuine !","310008":"i like flowery , musky scents if that makes sense . i don t wear perfume very often , but sometimes i wear estee lauder s sensuous nude or calvin klein s euphoria .","310009":"i don t normally take elevators , but i ve been around plenty of people with less than pleasant scents . i swear , there are some people who can t smell their own bo .","310010":"it isn t cheating if we discussed the opportunity beforehand and he agreed that i could pursue her . ? however , there s a slim to none chance of that happening anyway . she s a famous actress from australia and wouldn t be interested in a nobody such as myself , lol .","310011":"my day is going well , thank you for asking ! ! i ve been playing a video game called gone home , and i ve been enjoying it so far . it s currently free for xbox live members . it reminds me of layers of fear without the horror aspect , since you re going through your house and discovering clues about what happened to your family in the house . there s also a paranormal aspect to it which is interesting .","310012":"i met courrtana last summer ! ! it was a lot of fun we went walking around some gardens , and then we went to a dog park where we sat by the beach for a brief amount of time . i d also love to meet youcuntx , princess tal , lakocis , my name isnt eric , and heartofstitches . i think i d get along well with them all irl .","310013":"i don t think all tattoos should have an underlying meaning behind them as long as you know it s something you want and will enjoy for years to come , then that s perfectly fine . not all tattoos need to have meaning . i have tattoos that hold meaning and tattoos that hold no meaning . for example , my linkin park tattoo is extremely meaningful to me because the band saved my life when i was a teenager , and their music has always been a source of support growing up . on the other hand , my coffee tattoo is fairly meaningless as it s just an indication of my love for coffee . however , it s an amazing tattoo and i n still so enthralled by it .","310014":"lol , my pet peeves can be summed up by one word driving . i hate driving . i hate other people who drive around me . i hate people who take advantage of the road and think they re entitled . i hate when people try to blatantly show off their cars . i hate how people don t pay attention on the road . i hate being cut off . i hate merging because nobody has the compassion to let me in . i could go on and on .","310015":". . . it would be wonderful if people read bios for a change .","310016":"arrogance , close mindedness , and judgmental speech .","310017":"mental illness in general , even if it s towards common illnesses like depression and anxiety . while depression anxiety are more broadcasted globally , they re still relatively misunderstood by society and often people don t believe they deserve help because they re not depressed enough or anxious enough . that s just depression and anxiety , too . other more complex disorders like personality disorders and psychotic disorders are much more stigmatized and misunderstood .","310018":"considering i am presently dating a mentally ill person , yes . someone s illnesses do not define the type of person they are . while dealing with mental illness is a hurdle to overcome , if you re with the right person who understands your struggles , it makes it easier to handle .","310019":"psychiatric medication saves lives , including my own . i would have been dead one year ago if it wasn t for psych meds they ve completely turned my life around , as well as the lives of thousands of others . i m still figuring out the dosages of medications and which medications i should take , but i m on the right path and i m more level headed now than ever before

writing , either .","310025":"girl , interrupted . it s probably one of my favorite films because i can relate to the main characters so much , and so i can watch that movie endlessly and still enjoy it .","310026":"i took this photo of the sunset last night because it was absolutely gorgeous .","310027":"congratulations so does half of the rest of the population .","310028":"a new job where i make a hell of a lot more money than i m making now , and perhaps money for an apartment house .","310029":"that s not true by any means , especially considering he does undercover work and knowledge of pertinent social media sites is important to the job . you re not going to convince me and i m not going to convince you , so your best bet is to just drop the issue entirely . cc lakocis","310030":"ah , you re one of those nasty buggers . i m not going to waste my time assuring you that liam is real because you won t believe me anyway , but it s interesting to know that you re

just viewed my linkedin page , which apparently is a really good sign , and now i m super nervous because the only thing i can do is wait for a call back , aaaaahhhhh","310035":"i ve been attending therapy sessions for the past year , and tbh it s helped me a lot . i had a lot of unresolved trauma , unhealthy coping mechanisms , and abnormal patterns of thinking and behavior that needed attention , and going to therapy has made me more aware of my issues and what i can do to resolve them . there s no shame in seeking help if you think you need it , and therapy can be extremely beneficial to an array of people with an assortment of troubles .","310036":"i remember always getting excited when i would get twix bars , nerds , and atomic fireballs .","310037":"me ? into pumpkin flavored things ? not at all . i say as i sip an iced pumpkin latte and eat a slice of pumpkin bread","310038":"i normally tell them that i m not in the mood to tolerate their jokes and that it would be in their best interest to leave me alone for a while .","310039":"depression is a medical condition that waxes and wanes in what s called episodes . you can feel content for a brief period of time and still be diagnosed with depression , it would simply mean that it s either a single episode or in remission . obviously these episodes are to be tracked by a medical professional . i have recurring episodes , so my depression goes from either being very severe or at a neutral baseline . that doesn t mean i don t have depression anymore when i feel ok , though .","310040":"ahh thank you so much ! ! ?","310041":". . . what about it ?","310042":"probably my knife . or the pumpkin spice biscottis that i keep forgetting to eat , lol .","310043":"it has nothing to do with my performance at my job , thankfully . the company went bankrupt about two years ago and they announced that the last day we ll be open is early december . i have no choice but to find a new job .","310044":"men s hair styles vary and they each have different names as well i . e . , taper cut , crew cut , brush cut , flattop , etc .","310045":"if someone figures out the answer to this question , let me know . my social anxiety has been terrible over the past few weeks , and regardless of how many medications i take or hours i spend with my therapist , i cannot get over my social anxiety

with the loss of my job , with all of the added stress included with losing my job losing my insurance , not having a paycheck , job searching for a career that will make me happy , etc . it s been difficult to cope with these things , especially considering i have mental illnesses and their influence doesn t make the transition any easier . but the only thing i can do is keep moving forward , so that s what i m doing .","310048":"i like the idea of reincarnation , but i don t believe it actually exists .","310049":"i m having a few drinks with some friends .","310050":"i ve happily been in a relationship for seven years .","310051":"i just re read it and it isn t really too inappropriate for askfm , so i ll post it anyway . i m just paranoid about people stealing my work , which is why i never post my work on the internet .","310052":"i feel this on a personal level because i m still very much in a toxic environment , and its difficult for me to progress in my mental health treatment when i haven t left the environment which has traumatized me . i would suggest going to therapy , if you re able to do so . if you can t leave your environment , the best thing you can do for yourself is release your feelings to a professional and learn healthy coping mechanisms and different modalities of thinking in the meantime .","310053":"peaches ! ! i m actually drinking a fuzzy navel right now , ahah .","310054":"it depends on your metabolism it would be best to ask your own family practitioner what your eating habits should ideally be . some people are better off eating three big meals a day while others should eat six smaller meals throughout the course of the day .","310055":"when i was , i was a junior in high school and spent most of my time writing , listening to music , and doing schoolwork . i was also severely depressed when i was , so i was involved in a lot of damaging habits and behaviors .","310056":"yes , absolutely . a lot of people in the lgbt community are misunderstood by the general public because we re still not given equal rights as those who are straight or cis . if more people could walk in the shoes of someone who was lgbt and realized the struggles a person goes through , they d likely be much more tolerant , understanding , and supportive .","310057":"i m not posting a picture of my pajamas . get the hell outta here .","310058":"i guess it depends on how the date went if you feel as if you two had a good time together , you can probably call her the next day or the day after that .","310059":"this technically isn t my pet , but she s basically my baby and i love her so much .","310060":"i know what you mean it frustrates me , because if i didn t have mental health issues to begin with then i would probably be dealing with my life a lot better than i am now . granted , my coping mechanisms are a lot better now than say a year ago , but i still have a lot of progress to make . destiny is an intense game , though . it s a first person shooter , sorta like a space aged intergalactic timeframe , where certain people are blessed with extraordinary abilities . however , the fun parts of the game are the multiplayer events because nearly every section of the game is played with other people . usually i m a lone wolf when it comes to gaming , but destiny is really enjoyable when it comes to its multiplayer content .","310061":"i understand that in most other countries states , it s taboo for people to live with their parents if they re over years old . however , it s literally impossible for me to move out unless i was being paid k per year or had more than extra money to spend each money for rent , not including utilities . ily too though , thanks for being a friend boo .","310062":"i could if i wanted to , but that s a pretty shitty thing to do to a person .","310063":"i felt scared when my boyfriend s life was in jeopardy and there was nothing i could do about it . i felt complete peace when i went on vacation four years ago and had no worries about anything besides deciding what to do that day .","310064":"all of the troll messages you sent won t make you any less

term relationship with my boyfriend and we both know that we ll get married eventually .","310069":"some feminists , sure . a lot of modern feminists are quick to say that something is misogynistic , racist , discriminatory , etc . , without getting all of the facts of a case and understanding all sides of the conflict . a lot of people these days like to join in with the herd and mimic opinions without fully considering the facts , and it s unfortunate that people don t know how to do their own independent research anymore .","310070":"answering questions is addictive , and i ve never been able to stay away from this site for too long in the years i ve been here .","310071":"a person s ability to ask someone out on a date isn t dependent on their sex or gender . if you want to ask someone out on a date , then go ahead and ask them .","310072":"look at this queen . ? ? ? ?","310073":"yes , i believe in ghosts . i ve had a few paranormal experiences when i was younger , which affirmed my belief .","310074":"no , i probably said at some point that i wish it was a joke , but it s very much real .","310075":"no , i think he s unfit to be president of the united states . i don t agree with most of his viewpoints .","310076":"i don t really align myself with feminism anymore . i obviously still believe that everyone should have equal rights regardless of sex , gender , race , orientation , religion , etc . , but the modern feminism movement has become extreme over the past few years , and i don t want to associate with it .","310077":"this is a complicated question to ask me because i simultaneously love and hate myself . i love certain aspects of myself while i despise other aspects , which creates a lot of turbulence in my self esteem . some days i could feel satisfied with who i am , while other days i hate myself for who i am .","310078":"probably not . i m extremely introverted , socially awkward , and standoffish . i have no interest in meeting new people of the time , and it s not something i would ever be interested in doing .","310079":"no . i ve been in a committed relationship for quite a few years now .","310080":"i m a supporter of the original ideas of feminism , but i believe that modern feminism e . g . , present has derailed the original intentions of feminism and has turned the movement into somewhat of a joke . which is sad to me , because feminism has always been an obviously good cause and we still need to develop in the way society treats women and other oppressed groups . but modern movements in the name of feminism largely adds to the ongoing problem .","310081":"my passion is helping others particularly , through my writing another passion of mine and through mental health advocacy .","310082":"hello there nothing much is going on with my life at the moment today , i celebrated my boyfriend s goddaughter s birthday , which was a lot of fun . i m just relaxing for a while before heading back over to my boyfriend s house for the night .","310083":"it depends on my mood that day . sometimes i d rather be alone , while other times i d feel more comfortable being around other people mainly my boyfriend best friend . i like having my alone time when i get home from work so that i can relax and unwind , but usually after a few hours i m antsy and needing small bouts of social interaction .","310084":"you already asked me this a few days ago . you can kindly leave my page .","310085":"it wasn t offensive , but intrusive a bit . i m open about my sex and gender , but that doesn t mean other trans people are as patient as i am .","310086":"i used to be a decent artist when i was in high school , but i haven t actually done art in quite some time .","310087":"i honestly have no clue . usually whatever fragrance i chose to wear that day , i would assume .","310088":"haha thank you . their original message said i never endured any hardships , which i thought was hilarious because just because i don t talk about my hardships on askfm doesn t mean they never existed . in my response that got deleted , i said that i m not obligated to tell my story and i don t need to justify myself to anyone .","310089":"people who have lived through life without hardship . although its rare , people like that still do exist and i see them every once in a while through my travels . it s always made me angry and envious because i ve endured hardship my entire life and it s felt unfair , but i try not to let it get to me .","310090":"wake up and get some coffee with my boyfriend , spend the morning relaxing , and then picking up my best friend and going to the vineyards for the day . afterwards , we d come home to a relaxing bonfire in the backyard and swap stories until the early hours of the morning . i m a simple person to please . i don t need much money in order for me to make good experiences .","310091":"the few times my boyfriend and i went to a dude ranch nature resort in upstate new york are probably my fondest memories . the trips were always so relaxing , we spent time in the woods and on the lake , we drank a lot and had amazing conversations , and they were overall such wonderful experiences .","310092":"i m going to be unemployed in . months , and i m really upset . i thought i had another year to get my shit together .","310093":"i don t think i m qualified to speak on behalf of people with did since i m not diagnosed with did , but what i can say is that people with did are not inherently violent like the media makes them out to be . every single media product that portrays did puts them in a violent light , whether they re a serial killer or a murderer or just a generally manipulative person . in reality , that s not the case at all and people with did deserve respect and privacy just like anyone else . did is one of the most highly stigmatized illnesses .","310094":"salvador dali .","310095":"i mean , i think that s still borderline creepy . i can t imagine why a year old would want to be with someone so young . i made the mistake of dating an year old when i was , and he obviously had intentions that i wasn t ready for at such a young age .","310096":"a year old should absolutely not be in a relationship with anyone , let alone being intimate with a person . your brother really needs to rethink his priorities and realize that his pursuit of a year old is wrong . i can t stress that enough .","310097":"literally the only perk of growing older is being able to buy alcohol and then drink it whenever you want with no one to tell you otherwise . also , having breakfast for dinner . that s pretty great too .","310098":"pros you don t have to own a car , so there s no need for a car payment or insurance payment . big cities generally have multiple forms of public transportation , which makes it incredibly easy to get around . cons sometimes train tickets and bus taxi fare can be expensive , depending on where you re going . you re always going to be around other people . always . you have to resolve your schedule around the schedules of the transportation , which can sometimes be an inconvenience .","310099":"don t ask me , just winging it .","310100":"the only reason i can get away with coloring my hair at home is because my hair is short so i know i m able to get to every single strand , haha . when my hair was longer , i would either have a friend color my hair or do it at the salon because i didn t trust myself . getting dye on your face or ears isn t generally a big deal though because it washes off in the shower when you rinse your hair after you color it . some people recommend putting petroleum jelly around your forehead prior to coloring , but i ve never cared enough to do it myself .","310101":"i work for a disability law firm , and many of our clients are disabled due to mental illnesses . in addition , i try to maintain a strong social media presence and bring attention to mental health like here on askfm or on twitter so that discussions can be started and the stigma associated with mental health can be erased .","310102":"neuroatypical is a term used to describe people with mental illness es or cognitive developmental illnesses . in my case , i have several mental illnesses . i m an advocate for mental health and i try to use my experiences to help others , even though i m still on a journey towards healing myself .","310103":"not generally , no . i ve seen a few productions here and there but it isn t something i have a habit of doing due to finances .","310104":"it s fun to visit when you have a destination , but generally i m not that big of a fan when i m traveling from place to place because the streets smell like shit , it s overly congested , and people are rude as hell not gonna lie , i am too when i m in the city .","310105":"i m not religious , so i don t believe in the magic of praying or that it genuinely makes any difference in people s lives .","310106":"i recommend rehab as a shampoo because it helps restore hair to health , or if you re feeling ambitious and want to try something new , jason and the argan oil shampoo bar is really amazing and fun . as for conditioner , veganese is great . it s a light conditioner so it doesn t weigh your hair down and leaves it squeaky clean . however , everything is available from their website and they include specifics on what type of hair each product is best for . it s good to read up on each one and see what will work best for your hair .","310107":"anything that s extremely personal , that can be self incriminating , or that reveal details of my life that can bite me in the ass later .","310108":"i m sure i have at least a few times throughout my life .","310109":"it depends on what you re diagnosing yourself with and where you re getting your information from . i don t agree with self diagnosing complex disorders like personality disorders because the diagnostic criteria is specific and can mimic a combination of other disorders that only a trained professional can recognize . in addition , i wouldn t recommend joining support groups online because it might be seen as infiltrating the community . however , if you re diagnosing yourself with depression or anxiety , i think that s fine because they re extremely common and easy to recognize . it s also good to seek out support groups online for those sorts of things as well .","310110":"my own personal demons . i can escape my living situation and start a new life , but the memories of the past will always plague me .","310111":"watching true crime documentaries and other movies shows about serial killers .","310112":"chopped it off shaved it . i ve never felt more like myself than when i cut my hair off . also , switching over to organic lush products . they ve restored my hair so much over the past year , it s incredible .","310113":"pay off my debts , buy my boyfriend a new car , buy my best friend her husband new cars and a house , and buy my boyfriend and i a house down south .","310114":"controversial is more specific than unpopular , so that makes sense . pro choice . anti circumcision . pro vaxx . anti capital punishment . gender exists on a spectrum , so there are an infinite number of genders . trauma survivors aren t obligated to explain their stories or their triggers . trump is not fit to be president . black lives matter , but a lot of the blm movement spreads misinformation and prejudice . modern day feminism largely undermines the value and progress made by feminists of past history .","310115":"i don t place any significance in religion , no . i used to be interested in eastern philosophies but nothing has really resonated with me for quite a few years .","310116":"my hunter is fucking badass looking ignore my tiny level and power , i m only like halfway through the story .","310117":"instead of trying to describe it here on askfm

on the road who don t signal before they change lanes , assholes who cut me off at the last second , dickbags who won t let me merge from the entrance ramp , etc etc .","310120":"that s true ! ! i m not necessarily against porn addiction since it s an addiction like any other addiction to drugs or alcohol , so i understand why people can become addicted to it . but i just generally am not a fan of the industry as a whole due to the way it treats women . but even if someone was into pron , it wouldn t offend or phase me . my boyfriend watches pron , but that doesn t mean i m going to end the relationship , rofl .","310121":"i get the impression that some anons are trying to turn us against each other due to our differences in opinions , but they re too childish to understand that adults can still be friends while having a different opinion on a topic . gasp","310122":"my linkin park shirt came in the mail ! !","310123":"i don t really have a preferred gender since i m mostly attracted to cis men women and non binary boys . however , i m most attracted to a person s sense of humor . sometimes i act too serious in my own life , so i need a partner who s able to make me laugh and look on the brighter side of the spectrum .","310124":". . . how can you be certain that i ll do either ? ? this is dumb .","310125":"my resounding charm and wit , of course .","310126":"the

part about being in love with someone is the fact that you will always have a person by your side who will not judge you for what you say think and will always be honest with you . my partner is my greatest support system , and i can t imagine living my life without him because he s always honest with me about our relationship , he doesn t judge me for who i am , and he s willing to support me through everything i do . it s such a great source of comfort having someone like that in my life .","310157":"i usually wake up around am every morning , and i fall asleep between pm every night

never really knew about trans nonbinary identities until a few years ago , thanks to the internet . when i learned about those terms , everything just sorta clicked and made sense . it gave me a sense of closure because what i had been feeling for the past years finally made sense to me . as for strangers , i don t correct others because i m not out to most people and i present as very feminine to the public , so i would rather not go through the confusion of people saying , you re not actually trans . so i let it slide most of the time .","310161":"my boyfriend , both in a romantic and

vigilant about who you talk to and how much you reveal about yourself before you meet them .","310319":"to unapologetically be myself regardless of the circumstances surrounding myself . the right

of them . i think it s good for people to get into debates about a variety of topics because it opens you up to other people s opinions and different perspectives of thinking . of course , the downside of that is that you open yourself up to hearing some pretty close minded points of view , but it s always good to be aware of what other people think about a subject .","310332":"i definitely

success is whether success means how much money you make on a yearly basis or how happy you are how happy you make other people feel . for me personally , kindness is more important i would rather live my life knowing that i ve changed someone s life for the better than to simply have a boatload of money with no substantial impact whatsoever . bringing other people joy makes me feel as if my life has value , so that s much more important to me .","310374":"not many at all tbh i can t put a number to it . i rarely talk to people via text message because i d rather have face to face

up creating some of my happiest memories whether it s a weekend trip to montauk point , or to a dude ranch resort in upstate new york , or a day trip to queens to visit his grandfather , or going to a state we ve never been to before . we always make the best memories when it s just the two of us , and all we have to our names are our bodies , a small carry on bag , and no responsibilities for the

so many people out there who believe that public breastfeeding is disgusting and unnecessary , when in reality , it shouldn t be stigmatized at all . breastfeeding is a normal and natural means of feeding a child the idea that some people have to do it in public because their child is hungry shouldn t be seen as taboo , and there should be more acceptance everywhere . a person shouldn t have to hide in their car or in a bathroom stall to simply feed their child .","310382":"if i have a headache , i normally try to eat something with carbs and protein , pop a few ibuprofen , and drink a

it was filled with interesting people who had so much education to offer . late has been rather dull , but i believe lately it s been picking up speed because some old users have returned , and there are other new users who are educated and interesting and give good responses to questions .","310387":"my boyfriend and my best friend both have extremely good doggos , and i pet and play with them

me from facebook for petty reasons or if they have , they didn t have the guts to tell me what i did wrong . i ve removed people from my friends list because they were exes of my boyfriend and i didn

.","310397":"i used to take the school bus every morning , and during high school , i would walk home . i was always the last stop , so it would take the same amount of time to walk home as it did if

something i ve never considered before , but yes i believe that would be a good idea . obviously some books aren t suitable for children or teenagers , and it s important that there s some sort of warning on the book that it contains explicit or adult content . books are media just like any other form of entertainment , and there are some concepts which are too mature for children teenager eyes

otherwise i feel as if everything i do is meaningless and it leads me to having panic attacks and crises .","310404":"erasing the stigma associated with highly misunderstood mental illnesses , such as personality disorders , psychotic disorders , and trauma disorders .","310405":"i think it depends entirely on what the opinion is , but if it s something crucial that i m passionate about , i probably wouldn t be able to continue the friendship as i wouldn t be able to look at the person in the same light as i did before . i . e . , if a friend of mine starting spouting off homophobic transphobic nonsense , then i probably would have to re think our friendship because at that point , that crosses the line between something that is simply an opinion and something that s considered an injustice .","310406":"people who are not used to being genuinely loved and cared for don t typically believe that they re deserving of any love that s offered to them , which is why these same people push others away when they re offering any form of secure love or affection . for instance , if someone has been abvsed their entire life , they grow up believing that they deserve further abvse and neglect . if someone enters their life offering them emotional support and security , it will seem foreign to this person and they won t be able to trust their advances . a lot of people who are emotionally damaged distance themselves from healthy forms of relationships because they re so accustomed to being abvsed that they think that s all they deserve to know .","310407":"the movie the number is on netflix and i m so stoked because that movie is fucking brilliant .","310408":"i believe so , yes . how can you be friends with a person if you don t respect them ? ? respect is

look like needles unless you re watching the artist set up the gun itself , if that s any consolation for you , haha . however , it s a common fear and definitely not unheard of ! ! my best friend s husband is deathly afraid of needles , so he ll never get a tattoo .","310414":"tbh i was really afraid of the pain at first as well because you re essentially going in blind without any idea of what the pain feels like , but it isn t really as bad as i expected it to be and it s more of an annoyance as opposed to actual pain . but i would definitely recommend getting your first tattoo in a spot that s the least painful ! ! you can look up various charts online of which parts of the body are the most and least painful .","310415":"thank you ! ! i got them done at a variety of shops over the

you re a good writer . however , there s always room for improvement . always . seek out constructive criticism to make your writing better and stay humble when it comes to your finished projects . in addition , don t allow other people s writing to make you feel unworthy or inadequate . everyone has a different style of writing , and just because you like one person s voice doesn t necessarily

be passive about this at all . you re not in the wrong here .","310425":"some people simply don t give a shit , unfortunately .","310426":"yes , it does . when a parent terminates their rights as a parent , it also terminates the obligation of child support . if you want further information about this , speak to an attorney .","310427":"this isn t a question and doesn t pertain to me . if a person wants nothing to do with their child , they can choose to sign away their rights . people s scenarios aren t to be compared to one another . i m not lucky for having doubts about my own fertility , especially considering i m in a long term relationship with a person with whom i d want to have children later on down the road .","310428":"i just find it amusing how you re seemingly judging me for something you admit is a presumption about me as opposed to basing it on objective evidence . you can presume all you want about me because it doesn t affect my life at all . most

, it makes me feel even more like crap about myself because of how ordinary and mediocre i am . but that s more of a self confidence issue than anything else . when people lack self confidence ,

started writing creatively again . i have the motivation to begin looking for a new job new apartment . no matter how many mental breakdowns i happen to have it s usually once per month , which is a

breastfeeding is natural and people shouldn t have to fear public ridicule simply because their child is hungry . it s astounding how hypocritical society is , that we re more willing to see breasts sexualized in a public manner than to see breasts being used for the reason they were developed in the first place .","310505":"i d be willing to die for my boyfriend , and probably my best friend ,

first interacted with on my very first account because that was years ago , but i do remember logging into that account a few months ago and finding out that i had followers which was mind blowing to

seven tattoos in total . the only ones that were honestly painful were my rib tattoo and my calf tattoo . bones and muscle are the most painful places to get tattoos , so that particularly killed me

umbrellas on the beach when it s windy as fuck .","310513":"the most poignant example i can think of regarding the media s influence over the masses is the subject of the netflix show reasons why . the show revolves around a teenager who completes svicide and leaves behind tapes , blaming other people for her actions . the show has garnered a lot of controversy since its release , and it s had a profound impact on teenagers in today s society . the most extreme example of this are the examples of teenagers who have completed svicide and left behind tapes of their own to their friends and family that s a direct influence from reasons why and proves that the media can have a detrimental effect on the way impressionable minds think and behave .","310514":"i ve actually received a lot of backlash over my recent denouncing of liberal feminism , believe it or not a lot of people think that i m not an advocate for women s rights just because i openly criticize the modern day feminism movement , when in reality , i recognize that liberal feminism focuses on the most insignificant of tasks instead of on the concept of women s liberation , which is what feminism was originally founded upon . i also used to receive a lot of snide remarks over my understanding and support of islam and muslim people in general , but that topic hasn t come up in quite a while .","310515":"i m a big advocate for environmental rights , and i honestly believe that the issue of global warming and the lack of renewable resources are the most detrimental things to society . while the administration and the media are preoccupied with the latest drama revolving around our country s leaders , the environment is still declining and poses a huge threat to our standard of living .","310516":"i ve been active on askfm for at least years , and i ve had various usernames throughout the years i think my last one was leighlothlorien and the one before that was weareliberation . i ve become close to a lot of users over the years and watched them grow and mature , between marriage and having children and graduating from university . it s always such a proud feeling when one of your friends is making strides with their life , and the least you can do is cheer along from the sidelines .","310517":"lol get the fuck off my page , you creep .","310518":"i would certainly hope so

skimming the surface .","310521":"i prioritize other people s needs before my own . it s a natural habit because i grew up in an environment where other people s needs were more important than my own needs , and i was conditioned into thinking that i wasn t a person worth listening to .","310522":"lol i have a tendency to severely over analyze situations to the point where i begin to regret every interaction i ve had with that person and wish i could simply disappear for interacting with them in the first place . my mind never stops reeling .","310523":"i find it easy to be completely honest because at least you ll know that your story will always be consistent and you don t have to worry about making sure all of the loose ends connect . at the same time , i also believe a lie can be justified , especially if someone is in a difficult position where it becomes dangerous for them to tell the truth . i ve been in situations where the truth would have put in my danger , so i had to lie to save myself .","310524":"i m sorry you re feeling that way i hope you feel better soon . when i m down , my go to method is to try to sleep it off and start fresh when i wake up , or i try to keep myself busy so that i m not focusing on my mood . my down swings can last anywhere between an hour to weeks at a time , so it s difficult for me to ascertain when the feeling will pass . the only thing i can really do is continue to trudge onward because i know i would regret it if i decided to cave into my depression .","310525":"one of my coworkers is a delight to be around because she s honestly the cutest fucking thing and all of her reactions to things remind me of a cute , excitable hamster . she makes me smile and laugh all of the time and it makes working at my job a much more

for an apology from someone else but i know it ll never come so it s been difficult coming to terms with the fact that this person will never see their actions as wrong and never apologize for what they did to me .","310528":"i m always honest . besides , every time you send me this prompt , i never get any questions because you guys know i don t answer sexual questions . you just use it as a

my breakfast , so i chose to pay it forward and purchased the meal for the person behind me . now i ve just been sipping on my coffee and answering questions on my laptop . i m strangely in a terrific

sci fi channel .","310556":"i don t like talking about my family , my trauma , or sex . however , it depends entirely on how the person words it if they re being respectful or not and who is asking

coming from a good place the person giving it genuinely wants to help you succeed and they re willing to work with you to help you achieve that goal , which means pointing out things you could do better and helping you find the resources to do so . a personal attack comes from a bad place and that person wants you to feel bad about yourself . there s no opportunity for improvement and they

as a tattoo .","310563":"when i first heard of his passing , i was an entire mixture of emotions anger , sadness , hopelessness , helplessness , etc etc . i felt angry because of the way he chose to die . i felt angry because all of the messages in his songs were about overcoming obstacles and becoming who you truly are and seeking out help and support if you needed it , and his death was contradictory to everything he s been telling his fans . i felt angry because i felt lost and helpless after his death there was nothing i could do , and i was angry at myself because i feel like there was something i should have done , but as an insignificant fan , there was nothing i could do . i grew up feeling such an intimate connection to chester that i felt i knew him personally , even though i only met him once . but i was also filled with sorrow that washed away my anger . he was in pain , he s always been in pain , and he exhausted his resources for survival through to the very end . with his severity of mental illnesses , people say that it was a blessing that he lived for as long as he did . and as sad as i felt , i also felt blessed to have been able to share this

so leave me constructive messages https poetalunam . sarahah . com","310576":"he usually calls me out on it and tells me that i m over reacting , which tbh is good for me because my strong emotions makes it hard for me to distinguish whether or not i m actually over reacting . but we ve been together for so long that he understands that my mood swings are against my control and that my reactions are a result of my trauma . which is really refreshing tbh because i know so many people whose significant others would get angry at them for their behavior , because they couldn t understand why they felt so strongly . i m grateful that my boyfriend accepts me for who i am , even when my mental health makes me behave in erratic and irrational ways .","310577":"cont part and translating little things he says into he doesn t love me , i m a terrible person , he deserves better and should find someone else , etc . in my mind , which leads to either a breakdown or me shutting down and putting up a wall . i know he doesn t like when i do this , and neither do i , but i just can t seem to help it . obviously this stems from my deep rooted insecurities and self hatred , but i d like to think there are ways for me to not overreact in such ways even if i don t love myself as of now without feeling like im faking it , so to speak . tbh i know exactly how you feel because my bpd makes me do the same exact things i have a tendency to over react to minor incidents , i jump from a to z in a moment s notice , i m hypersensitive to people s statements especially from my boyfriend or someone i care about , etc etc . i ve been in therapy for about a year now , and so far none of what my therapist has tried to teach me has helped , because i m still over reacting to little things and jumping to conclusions super fast . i think it s just something you have to eventually condition yourself into thinking that s bad , you have to keep reminding yourself that not everything is in black or white terms i know it s easier said than done , and people don t generally have ulterior motives in what they do and say . i feel you though , i really honestly do and i hope you learn over time how

a long time before trump s policies are actually enacted into the military . but the idea behind transgender people not being able to serve in the military is all kinds of fucked up , and i

delving back into really unhealthy coping mechanisms . as much of a habit it is for me to resort to unhealthy means of coping with negative feelings , i m trying to break that habit and lead a

since i started seeing my therapist , and it was a very cathartic and therapeutic experience . beforehand , i suppose i never felt comfortable enough to reveal my vulnerabilities in front of her , but

.","310620":"i m very conflicted on feminism because while it started out as a radical and evolving movement , social media seems to have ruined it in a way a lot of people are picking up on feminism as a means to bolster their own popularity instead of using it to actually develop real changes in society . i don t consider myself to be much of a feminist anymore . i still have the same opinions as when i was a feminist for the most part , i think , but i just don t bother labeling myself .","310621":"i don t think including the whole with personality disorders snippet is necessary . you can just simply say abvsive people will deny that there is anything wrong with them . there s this misconception out there that people diagnosed with personality disorders are inherently abvsive people , which is not true at all and most people with personality disorders are more of a threat to themselves than other people . although there will always obviously be a small percentage of people with personality disorders who become abvsive as a coping mechanism , it shouldn t be representative of people with personality disorders as a whole .","310622":"i can t tell if you re the same anon or a different anon , but this is true my bpd causes me to have unpredictable emotional outbursts , and considering the fragile state i ve been in already , almost any miniscule event can unfortunately tip me off . it doesn t help that i ve had major writer s block , so i ve been unable to release my emotions in a creative fashion the past few days either . my therapist is going to have her hands full on tuesday , lmao .","310623":"they aren t foolish or childish conspiracy theories , my tendency towards bitterness is a coping mechanism from longstanding trauma that s basic psych bullshit . if you

sleeping in , drinking coffee together , and chilling out before he had to go to work . i stopped by starbucks on the way home . presently , i m sitting at my laptop and attempting to write an essay about chester bennington and his influence on me when i was growing up . it s been difficult , but i m hoping to finish it tonight or tomorrow .","310632":"i was going to keep this a secret until thursday , but i can t hold it in because of how much it means to me , but there s an chance of me getting a linkin park tattoo this week , memorializing chester bennington . it s going to just be a small logo with some color splashed behind it , but i feel like i need to do this . chester was too much a part of my childhood and part of the reason why i m alive today to not do something for him .","310633":"why wouldn t men be allowed to wear colored contact lenses . . . ? ? it doesn t bother me what someone else decides to do in order to modify their body . if it makes them happy , then i

unnecessary . shut your damn mouth for two seconds and wait to swallow your food , you fucking animals .","310642":"even though it s incredibly difficult , i ve found that the most reliable way to get over a creative rut is to powerhouse your way through it . keep on creating , even when you don t necessarily feel the inspiration . if every artist only did art when they felt inspired , there would be a lot less art in the world today . a lot of what encompasses art is dedication to the craft and the discipline to remain consistent at that craft regardless of how you feel that day

everyone is equal in the us concept is a lie because people who are trans or gay face a hell of a lot of prejudice on a daily basis for simply being who they are . there are a lot of bigots who exist in this country , and there s even a lot of legislation that doesn t ensure that gay and trans people have the same rights as cis and straight people .","310645":"unused medication . i probably have about bottles of pills just laying around in my room from when i was on trials of different medication to try to curb my symptoms of depression and anxiety . i really should get rid of them for my own safety , but i haven t done so yet .","310646":"well , i spent the morning running errands because today is my father s birthday , so i went out and picked him up a birthday gift as well as a cake for dessert . i also stopped at the deli to pick up breakfast for my parents . i m spending the afternoon by answering questions on askfm as well as writing the rough draft of a new personal essay i m working on . i m currently outside in my backyard on my laptop with a glass of iced tea , which has been really relaxing . i get too distracted when i try to write inside . i have no plans for tomorrow sunday , but i m probably going to focus on finishing my essay and having it edited so that i can publish it monday morning .","310647":"i would like to eventually be a published author , whether it s a book of personal essays , a fiction novel , or a book of poetry . it s always been my dream to be a published writer .","310648":"hell was my childhood . no matter what i experience now , it will never be as bad as what i went through when i was a child and a teenager , and in that realization is growth and strength . i can find the strength in me to continue battling on because if i can survive my past , then there s no reason for me not to survive what lies ahead .","310649":"i m writing a personal essay about chester bennington s death and how he impacted my mental health during a traumatic time of my life . if anyone would like to read the essay when i m done , please like this answer . ? i m writing this essay for myself , but i d also be interested in knowing how many people would potentially want to read my writing in light of this difficult time .","310650":"it s hard to reverse characteristics of people when they re so ingrained in how a person grew up , like how racism mostly is . you can sit him down and explain to him why his thoughts are harmful to others , but he probably won t react in a kind manner or realize that he s being discriminatory . that s been my personal experience with racism , at least . it takes a long time to reverse terrible thought patterns , but the person has to believe they re wrong first and foremost . if he doesn t believe that what he thinks is wrong , there might not be a way to change it .","310651":"i used to want to work in the music industry , so i learned how to play the guitar , ukulele , and keyboard . i haven t picked up an instrument in years , so idk if i would remember anything anymore .","310652":"hello i just finished running errands for the day , so now i m thinking of sitting down and writing a personal essay about chester bennington and the influence he had on me when i was a teenager .","310653":"thank you ! !","310654":"it s terrible to make jokes about anyone s death , regardless of whether or not they were a celebrity , and especially considering the circumstances under which he died . perhaps i m just sensitive because i m very biased towards chester bennington , i ve always had an intense emotional connection to him and his music , but i ve been getting very angry every time i see someone speak badly about the situation .","310655":"i think it s amusing how i post one risque photo and it s not even risque , it s simply me in my bathing suit , and suddenly my inbox is filled with a bunch of pervs who feel the need to comment on the shape and size of my body . you re all useless and pathetic . crawl back into the hole from whence you came , you re not wanted here .","310656":"i m against the death penalty . i think it s a hypocritical and barbaric way to punish a person for the crimes they ve committed . as an additional matter , the death penalty is also draining on tax payer dollars .","310657":"rest in paradise , chester bennington . ?","310658":"? ? ?","310659":"i finally want an excuse to post a bikini picture but nobody wants to ask me smh .","310660":"despite me mourning over chester s death , i received my new bikini in the mail today and it looks amazing on me .","310661":"i care as well as millions of other people . you can kindly fuck off .","310662":"they honestly meant so much to me both on a personal and musical level , and my heart feels so heavy . i feel like there s this big gaping hole inside of me right now . but this is why mental illness needs to be taken more seriously . we need to erase the stigma . we need to talk about what s wrong and be more accepting of others and encourage people to seek help before it s too late .","310663":"first welcome back ily . second i m crying too ily so much we re in this together . ? ? ?","310664":"yes , that s exactly the reason why i was so attached to them . thank you","310665":"i can relate to this so much . their music was a coping mechanism for me and it inspired me to continue battling on despite the obstacles in front of me . i m here for you if you need anything . ?","310666":"linkin park is literally the reason why i m alive because they helped me endure through so much of my trauma when i was a teenager . i m forever in debt to them because of what they ve been able to provide for me . and chester , especially . i ve always resonated with him the most due to him being open about his own personal demons and he was such an inspiration to me . when i met him , i choked on my words because i couldn t convey to him how much he truly meant to me . i m honestly sick with heartache right now .","310667":"chester bennington just died and i m literally sitting at my desk at work , trying not to cry my eyes out . his music was such an inspiration to me and it kept me alive when i was a teenager , when all i wanted to do was die . his music gave me life and a purpose and something to hold onto . i m so sad right now . rip , chester . you ll be missed terribly .","310668":"it s fahrenheit and humid as hell s crotch .","310669":"getting my tattoo next thursday ! ! i m hella excited and can t wait to get it done , i ve been wanting new ink for so long .","310670":"i wouldn t be offended , but i would definitely be concerned a year is a long time to date someone , and if someone isn t comfortable telling you certain things about their lives , there s a legitimate reason behind it . i . e . a lot of trauma survivors have troubles trusting in relationships so they ll either lie about really small insignificant things or not disclose some information . it isn t a reflection of their trust in you individually , but it s something ingrained in them from a young age .","310671":"children shouldn t be sexualized regardless of what they re wearing but the fact that calvin klein is marketing intimate apparel for babies is fucking yikes .","310672":"i ve seen discourse regarding people claiming that bisexuality is transphobic or something along those lines , but i ve personally never seen anyone say anything bad about pansexuality . sexuality isn t really something i talk about among my friends , though , or even really on the internet except for on askfm , lol .","310673":"tbh the entire concept just makes me really uncomfortable , and it makes me think of how horrible society has become to the point where now literal children are expected to be sexualized and are often berated by their classmates for not taking part in sexual activities even though they re literally children . the entire thing just makes me feel so queasy and disgusted .","310674":"lol my present job law firm has the most ridiculous commercials , but i m not posting a video of it because that would reveal where i work . i never actually saw the commercial until after i was hired , and it was one of those classic facepalm moments .","310675":"my friends would likely be courrtana , princess tal , heartofstitches , celinem , and shehitsback . i wouldn t cook anything because i would actually want them to enjoy the food , so we d probably go somewhere like the cheesecake factory or a diner .","310676":"the last piece of clothing i purchased was a high waisted two piece bikini from amazon . i m excited for it to come because it looks so cute ! !","310677":"i think it s rude to make jokes about someone s weight regardless of whether or not an overweight person is around .","310678":"no . ac units are relatively inexpensive but not everyone can afford air conditioning or the increase in the cost of electricity it brings .","310679":"no , i m not religious at all . i used to be very spiritual when i was younger and i had great faith in the earth , but i ve recently become very distant from my spiritual beliefs due to mental illness and stress .","310680":"i don t pay enough attention to other people s lives to determine whether women or men cheat more often . i m sure in the grand scheme of things , the numbers are pretty even .","310681":"sometimes , but not all of the time . there are moments where i revel in attention and try to call attention to myself , but there are also a lot of times where attention makes me uncomfortable and i d rather fade into the background . i guess it all depends on my mood that particular day .","310682":"my entire time , i ve been told that i m a selfish person but lately i ve been realizing how wrong they are because i m incredibly selfless and would do anything if it meant i was helping someone in need .","310683":"i ve only ever dated like three people , but i was friends with them all before we started dating .","310684":"the cheesecake factory has pretty good food and drinks .","310685":"i ve learned that it s useless to develop opinions on how other people conduct their relationships . it doesn t affect my life in any way , so i couldn t care less about what other people do .","310686":"i ve always loved birch trees . they re whimsical in a way .","310687":"discrimination towards people with disabilities , ableism , racism , transphobia , homophobia , etc etc .","310688":"my boyfriend and i don t place any importance in celebrating anniversaries tbh , we haven t celebrated an anniversary in a really long time probably because we ve been together for so long , lol . i m sure that will change once we get married , though . but a relationship is simply a close connection with someone to whom you love on a romantic level . it s a mutual understanding of the emotional connection you share and the understanding that neither of you want to share that connection with anyone else unless polyamory is your thing , no judgment here . people put too much importance on labels , but a relationship is just the concept that you re in love with your best friend and you can t imagine experiencing your life with anyone else by your side .","310689":"i m a pretty big fan of game of thrones , but i wouldn t say i m as into the series as most other fans are . i m likely going to watch the first episode of season seven tonight because some coworkers want to talk about it , and i m pretty excited to see what season seven has in store .","310690":"coming from a background of financial strife , money is somewhat important to me but it doesn t define who a person is . money gives people security when it comes to shelter , nourishment , and medicine , but what i ve learned is that money does not dictate the type of person you are and you shouldn t be defined by how much money you have in the bank . my current partner struggles with finances . i struggle with my own finances . however , we ve always made our relationship with despite our financial struggles because our relationship is not defined by money . i would still be in love with him regardless of whether he s rich or poor .","310691":"i feel loved when people tell me that things remind them of me , or when they go out of their way to show me something that they think i would enjoy . in addition , i feel loved when people give me attention if i happen to be craving it at that particular moment , especially coming from my boyfriend or any close friend of mine . i like verbal displays of affection , and i like being told when i mean something significant to someone else .","310692":"we met through a mutual friend who invited both of us out at the same time with a group of other friends unbeknownst to me , she was actually attempting to set us up together . we went to an amusement park for the night .","310693":"i usually allow the artist to draw up their own design , but my best friend and i are getting matching avocados on our ankles ! ! we ve been wanting to get a friendship tattoo for ages and it seemed like the perfect idea , haha .","310694":"if you re putting in more effort to maintain the friendship than your friend is . if your friend constantly belittles you , makes your problems seem insignificant , or is absent in times of struggle . if you find yourself not looking forward to seeing them anymore or when time spent with them puts a drain on you mentally or physically . if the friendship is clearly toxic to your well being , making you feel terrible about yourself even during the good days . if your friend clearly doesn t care about your feelings and performs actions in spite of their knowledge that it will hurt you .","310695":"my biggest weakness is my unrelenting self doubt and lack of self esteem . from a young age , i was berated for doing even the simplest of things , which has forced me to grow up and think very little of myself . i m constantly criticizing myself for not doing better , belittling myself for becoming over emotional about things , and doubting my own achievements and abilities . because i was raised in such a negative environment , my relationships have suffered as a result . i don t feel worthy to be friends with my friends , to be in a relationship with my boyfriend , or to be successful at my job . my weaknesses have ultimately broke me , bringing me down to my knees at every minor inconvenience .","310696":"clowns used to frighten me when i was a child . however , as i ve gotten older , the fear has dissipated completely .","310697":"yes . i would absolutely risk my life if that meant saving the lives of my boyfriend and my best friend . their worth is far too great to this world , and they ve already accomplished so much and have done so many good deeds to those around them . my boyfriend and best friend both deserve the chance to live their lives to the fullest extent .","310698":"the meaning of life is to create a life of meaning .","310699":"i probably wouldn t do anything different in my life . the only extra thing i would enjoy would be male privilege .","310700":"appearance and lbs , stocky build cuban italian heritage , so he has olive skin and dark hair eyes short , cropped hair with a side fade and a gnarly , groomed beard casual style of dress

never done a shout out and i don t plan on starting now especially considering i don t know who you are .","310704":"hello nothing much , just eating some ice cream and watching wentworth before bed .","310705":"i don t know what this is supposed to mean .","310706":"thank you so much . ?","310707":"literally every day of my life tbh . if this is something that s seriously impeding on your life , though , i would make a doctor s appointment to discuss your symptoms . it could be an indication of an underlying condition or perhaps you just need to make a few lifestyle adjustments .","310708":"why not both ? ?","310709":"i m so sorry that they used you like that nobody deserves to be treated that way , and you re a better person than your ex will ever be . even though this is making you sad now , it s good that they re out of your life because now you can move on and work on your own mental health and do things that fulfill you and make you happy . you only deserve to have people in your life that bring you joy and comfort , and soon you ll realize that you re worth so much more than how they treated you . i hope you feel better , lovely .","310710":"that sounds terrible . i used to live in an area like that , of course it was a college town but it was also filled with disgusting people who committed crimes at all hours of the night and it was such a toxic environment to live in .","310711":"watching wentworth and eating dinner . in a little bit , i m going to finish up my laundry and attempt to clean my room . i haven t cleaned it in weeks , and i think it would help my mental state if i was living in a cleaner more organized environment . i haven t had the motivation to do anything in weeks , so i m hoping this kickstarts some of my drive .","310712":"ahh , this is honestly one of the sweetest things anyone has ever said to me ! ! ? thank you so much .","310713":"? ? ? my name is leigh as my profile clearly says .","310714":"i m terribly sorry your experiences haven t been good . unfortunately , that s the reality of being trans , and it s really disappointing . if you ever need to talk or vent , my inbox is always open . i m here for you even if nobody else seems to be , and i will always be here to support you . ?","310715":"cold compress to the area that hurts , lay down in a dark room , close your eyes , and try to relax for a little while . also take some ibuprofen if you have it , that s good for headaches or any kind of swelling inflammation .","310716":"i love the broccoli cheddar soup from panera . i also really like baked potato soup and new england clam chowder .","310717":"text her and tell her that you have major phone anxiety and talking on the phone makes you nervous it isn t anything against her at all because it happens with everyone you talk to . she probably won t take it personally and will understand because it s a common problem people have .","310718":"perhaps you should follow different people then if your instagram feed is filled with people shaking their asses . ? my instagram feed is filled with people going to weddings and posting photos of their babies , so obviously we re in quite different stages of our lives .","310719":"ahh , thank you ! ! this is too sweet . ? ?","310720":"not that many people on askfm are avid gamers , haha . i ve had quite a few anons talk to me about the elder scrolls over the years , though .","310721":"my st birthday was pretty lit . my friends and i threw a huge get together at a local bar to celebrate my coming of age alcohol wise , lol . my first legal drink was a long island iced tea .","310722":"i m sorry that you re going through this , and i m sorry that your friends and family don t seem to understand the severity of your social anxiety . however , i m always here for you if you need to talk . you re not alone in your struggles . ?","310723":"i don t think my followers would appreciate me sending my own around , so if anyone wants to give me an honest opinion , my inbox is open ! ! ?","310724":"tbh i don t cope with social anxiety at all , and if anything , it s been quite debilitating for me over the years . i don t talk to people on the phone . i avoid social situations whenever possible unless it s with my boyfriend or my best friend . i m terrified and uncomfortable around large crowds of people , so i avoid it at all costs . i go shopping in the early morning when nobody else is awake . and i only drive when it s absolutely necessary for me to drive .","310725":"photography has always been meaningful to me because it s a method of self expression that i ve personally been very good at over the years . i like being able to capture an image that shows the true beauty of this world , mainly because it

don t owe him anything simply because he claims he misses you . you have to act in your own best interest at times , and this is one of those cases where you don t need to give a response . move on with your life . he needs to see that he isn t a part of your life anymore so that he can move on too .","310727":"i have too much makeup than i know what to do with , tbh . i rarely use it , if only for special occasions and the rare occurrence of when i want to take a new profile picture for social media .","310728":"that s the concerning thing about mental illness when you re young , most people show early signs of mental illness but it gets brushed off as teenage hormones . i should have received mental health treatment when i was a teenager , but everyone downplayed my symptoms and treated them as if it was just a phase , something i would grow out of . i never did . if you re concerned about your mental health regardless of your age it s in everyone s best interest to seek treatment if it s readily available to you . even if you don t have mental illness , it doesn t hurt to seek professional help .","310729":"a lit cigarette and a cup of iced coffee , preferably on my patio . they re the necessities of everyday life .","310730":"my boyfriend and i were foolishly dancing to this song last night . ? https youtu . be yggzakp hum","310731":"i ve been at war with myself for a long time . the thing about mental illness is that you become your own worst enemy , and everything you attempt to do to remedy the situation is turned against you and used a fuel to ignite the fire . i ve always been at odds with myself ever since i was a teenager , and my brain has always used everything in the environment against me . i m in mental health treatment now , so i ve slowly been learning how to deal with my erratic mood swings and black and white thinking , but i m not of the way there yet . i probably never will be .","310732":"i m passionate about writing . i first realized i was passionate about writing when i was a young child . i have snippets of memories of when i was younger and attempting to write a book i can t remember what it was about , but i always dreamed of being a published author . as for future plans , i m just trying to continuously write and improve on my skills . i ve been working on personal essays one of which is in my bio . i want to use my experiences with mental health to help other people who are struggling with the same thing .","310733":"anyone else have some honesty day questions ? i ll even do q q if anyone would like to participate ! !","310734":"the little things in life please me waking up to forehead kisses , having the first cup of coffee and a smoke in the morning , having a pleasant conversation with the cashier or barista , making all of my work deadlines , playing video games , and having fulfilling conversations with friends . ?","310735":"i m not a fan of cars or racing . i m lucky enough that my mental health is just stable enough for me to independently drive a car without crashing it or having a panic attack inside of it .","310736":"thank you","310737":"my favorite position is when i m laying curled into a burrito with my boyfriend s down comforter as he feeds me potato chips while we re watching youtube . sometimes there s a bearded dragon crawling on me , which is comforting at times .","310738":"this morning while my boyfriend was leaving for work a little more than an hour ago . we kissed goodbye while i wished him a good day .","310739":"we do , in fact , have the best bagels and pizza . this isn t just a stereotype , this is factual information . billy joel said it best you either date a rich girl from the north shore or a cool girl from the south shore . this holds so much truth in it . long island drivers are some of the worst drivers in this nation . new yorkers are usually stereotyped as angry , but that s nothing compared to a long island middle aged father going through a mid life crisis and driving a convertible audi down . long island and the five boroughs are called new york . everything else is upstate .","310740":"although in my experience , the anons in question are only looking to start drama or cause a commotion and care about their own feelings moreso than they care about yours .","310741":"isoleatlantic has the ability of free will and can do whatever she pleases . she said she s going through a difficult time , and if you truly cared about her feelings , you would empathize with her and understand that maybe deactivating or becoming less active on askfm will be the best thing to help her through this transition .","310742":"i don t wear watches , let alone a smartwatch .","310743":". . . what does this mean .","310744":"? ? ? psa ? ? ? for anyone who s on multiple medications taken throughout the day , i found a really good app to download that ll give you reminders to take your meds as well as helpful info about your meds ! ! it s called medisafe . i just downloaded it two days ago and so far i haven t missed a dose because you can customize how many reminders it sends you during whatever time of the day you need to take your medication . i highly recommend it ! !","310745":"yes , i do . i don t give it out to anons or strangers , though .","310746":"lol . my own parents are a different story . i m not here to discuss my relationship with my parents because it s irrelevant . however , your logic is flawed . finances aren t directly correlated to love , it s simply a matter of whether or not a person has the money to spend to begin with . there are families living in poverty all over the nation however , their financial situation doesn t dictate whether or not they love their family . just because a family doesn t have the means to spend money on frivolous matters doesn t necessarily mean they don t love one another with all they have .","310747":"having a smoke outside . i m debating on taking a nap tbh .","310748":"hello there","310749":"welcome back ! ! ? ? my day has been relatively okay i spent the morning with my boyfriend before he went into work , i picked up some starbucks on the way home , and i ve been relaxing and playing video games ever since . tomorrow , i m going to be a bit busier since i ll have to run some errands and do some chores , so i m trying to take advantage of this quiet time while it lasts .","310750":"i drink fairly often probably times per week .","310751":"? ? ? same reason why some people have straight teeth growing up without needing braces . it depends entirely on the size shape of someone s mouth and how the teeth grow during childhood . my family never had dental insurance , so i was never able to get braces when i was a child . it s never been something that bothered me , so if that s what you re attempting to do , then your efforts are futile .","310752":"whether or not tori is pregnant isn t anyone s business except her own . i fail to see how her personal life is of any interest to anyone on askfm . instead of projecting your anger and insecurities onto tori and her followers , why don t you take some time for some introspection and evaluate why you re so emotionally invested in a stranger s life .","310753":"had a hangover yes . work a formal dress no . been spoken to by police no . had my birthday no . had sex yes . been swimming no . ate salmon yes .","310754":"i m sorry you re going through this . try to tackle each problem individually instead of thinking of everything as a whole . sometimes when we consider everything at once , it becomes overwhelming and it almost suffocates us . if you break everything apart and try to focus on one thing at a time , you might find it easier to deal with .","310755":"my favorite aspect of my personality is my willingness to help people , especially with respect to mental health concerns . my least favorite is my mood instability and the fact that i have a disorder that s literally ingrained into my personality to the point where i have no concept of my own identity .","310756":"tw rvpe uh , yeah . just because something doesn t fit the criteria of the rights you re fighting for doesn t necessarily mean it isn t an issue or equally as important . radical feminism focuses mainly on women s rights as it s derived from the root of feminism s origins , but that doesn t justify a person saying that male on male rvpe isn t a problem in society .","310757":"my boyfriend is extremely sarcastic , so yes . i have a tendency to gravitate to people with a dry or dark sense of humor .","310758":"you re better off without her . if you re trying to improve yourself by trying to find a new job , then she has no right to complain because you re working on bettering yourself . in addition , it s extremely shallow for a person to judge you based on what kind of job you have what she should have been focused on is whether or not you re happy in that job . as for your personality , if she doesn t like something as fundamental to your personality as your sarcasm , then chances are you won t get along anyway , especially in a relationship context .","310759":"like i stated in my earlier answer , he lives in a constant state of chaos . he leaves a mess wherever he goes , which makes me twitch sometimes . he ll leave clothes on the ground , dishes on the table , won t hang up the towel in the bathroom , small stuff like that . that s really the only major thing that bothers me about him , which actually isn t all that bad . it s just something we need to work on together , especially once we move in together .","310760":"ahh , i m sorry you re going through this ! ! sleep is so vital to your well being so i hope you found a solution . tbh whenever i can t sleep , i drink alcohol because it always makes me sleepy and sends me right into rem sleep . i know it isn t the healthiest means of falling asleep , but it s usually the only concoction i have on hand . i used to take melatonin , but it would knock me out too hard to the point where i was having difficulty waking up in the morning . but some other things you can do don t look at electronic devices before bed , drink a cup of chamomile or sleepytime tea , make sure the room is dark with no light , and try to go to bed the same time every night so that your body becomes accustomed to falling asleep at that time .","310761":"i m left handed . which can be aggravating at times because i always seem to sit on my boyfriend s right side while eating , so

shouldn t be taboo .","310765":"i m hella hungover from last night , but at least it was a good night that totally erased all of my negative feelings from throughout the week . now i m just sitting

decided to use you as an example of what not to do in front of the entire department . ? ? ?","310777":"he has no fur , but he s still my baby . ?","310778":"i m fairly socially awkward . sometimes i don t know what to say in social situations , so i m usually very awkward and shy . i have a tendency to stumble over my words and blank out . however , i m fairly open when i m talking to my boyfriend or close friends . i m much more comfortable around them than , for example , a complete stranger .","310779":"the only thing you can do is to try your best with what s given to you your workload may be stressful but try to take each day at a time instead of looking at the bigger picture all the time . it s a lot easier to organize your time when you break things up into increments as opposed to trying to think about everything as a whole . most people don t know what they want to do when they go to college that s just a fact , and some people still don t know what to do even when they re graduating . you re not expected to have a picture perfect image of your college career because that s unrealistic , college is for finding your passion and furthering yourself if you do find it then . i m sure your grades are wonderful , and i believe in you even if you don t believe in yourself right now . you re going to ace your ap exams and eventually when you do go to college , you ll find something you re genuinely interested in . ?","310780":"pretty much everyone i follow , tbh . i ll pick five people at random mazonbr lakocis theonlyems livibates

power brownout , to the point where my computer refused to even turn on . we all segregated in close quarters in the training rooms that had no ac , and then i realized i couldn t access the program we use to sort clients files . that got fixed a few hours later . then a few hours after that , the power went out again . i lost what i was working on , so after they fixed the power an hour later , i had to redo everything i already did .","310783":"most of my dreams have a tendency to revolve around my job , which is sickening because i already spend more than enough time at my job to begin with . however , i think they represent my apprehension about my job and how unhappy i m there at times , especially if the dreams occur after a particularly stressful day at work . i also have a tendency to experience nightmares where i m either trapped somewhere and cannot escape , or i m being chased by something . in those scenarios , i think they represent my inner feeling that i m presently trapped in my current living situation and that i won t be able to out run my past .","310784":"i can pretty much incorporate the use of the term fuck into any scenario .","310785":"no . unfortunately , all of my admirers made their feelings quite clear to me at the time , which always left me in awkward positions because i always felt guilty for telling them that i didn t feel the same way in return . to push matters further , some of those admirers didn t seem to care that their feelings weren t reciprocated and tried to pursue me anyway . some people simply don t know when to quit .","310786":"according to pottermore and multiple other less credible quizzes , i m in slytherin .","310787":"my work outfit for the day .","310788":"i didn t do any of the actual cooking for the

has any bearing on whether or not your friend gives good advice .","310790":"if i existed back then and was anything like the social activist that i am now , then i probably would be that person fighting for equal rights . women s rights has always resonated strongly with me , and i ve never been the type of person to sit back and let things slide . i likely would have been arrested or killed , but i still would have advocated for better rights .","310791":"i love harry potter so much that i went to a harry potter fan convention a few weeks ago , where people in the audience entered into the sorting hat ceremony , was given palm readings by a divination professor , dueled with wands , played wizard s chess , cosplayed , and drank butterbeer ! !","310792":"i have , actually . it was in reference to the time before smartphones and wifi , where the phone connection was connected to the computer and people talked to one another using aol messenger and phone calls instead of texting .","310793":"it s a photo of my body . i woke up strangely feeling confident in my curves , which is unusual for me because normally i m extremely dysphoric with hatred for my body . so i decided to take a picture to document this feeling . i m slowly learning to take my feelings in as they come and not questioning them , because some days i m confident in myself while other days i feel foreign in my own skin . today just happens to be one of those good days for me .","310794":"i usually follow people whose answers are coherent and entertaining , meaning that their answers have substance to them and generally aren t one worded answers . i like when people put the time and effort into their responses . that being said , i don t follow people for no reason whatsoever because then it clogs my feed . so if anyone ever sends me those follow follow prompts , i usually just delete them .","310795":"i d rather delete questions than respond to them by saying i m not interested in answering

stogies , and billiards","310799":"i think there s a difference between someone wanting to be a stay at home wife mother to provide for the family and someone who clearly and irrationally refuses to work and expects their spouse to financially support the family . feminism is about equality but it s also about having the choice to decide what to do . i agree with you that people who refuse to work and expect their spouse to pay for everything are acting a bit hypocritical , but that s a different scenario than a person who wants equal rights and either can t work or wants to stay home and do what they can to help the family at home . idk if this message made that distinction clear enough , so let me know if you don t understand ."}}
