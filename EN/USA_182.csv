   Anything can be said about anything. We all have opinions, but the universal facts (when it comes to character assessment), require time to bear out. It's why I'm certain of the good things I said about you. I've followed you for like 5-6 years and you have consistently been admirable in many ways.

  Well okay, I get that but you just don’t know him like I do. But I do appreciate the kind things you said about me.

  In that case anything could be said about anything, doesn’t make it true

976517,"
   Why did you remove him from your bio?
  ","
  I didn’t, I was just redoing it

976518,"
   So he decided to pop up, steal your innocence, then ""get bored"" and disappear. I hope the guilt eats away at him.
  ","
  We don’t use ask to talk. We met on ask, but talk other ways and in person. He doesn’t need ask to be with me.
  "
976519,"
   Because he projects selfish, manipulative energy whereas you are selfless, pure-hearted and open. I foresee his qualities exploiting and weakening yours over time, hollowing you out, leaving you a shell of your former self. That would be a tragic waste of the beautiful gift that is you.
  ","
  the hell? You don’t even know him, he’s nothing like that.

   In what ways is Jeff different from your exes?
  ","
  He actually knows what he wants and he’s committed in this relationship. And he actually loves me for who I am and he doesn’t try to change me. He’s also very caring and protective and always so sweet to me.  He shows me so much affection and love, and is truly one of a kind and very unique. He’s so much different than them because he knows what he wants and he isn’t scared of commitment. He isn’t afraid to give me his all, like he is fully in the relationship and he puts in so much effort towards the relationship and me and it’s just incredible truly.  He doesn’t play games with me and he doesn’t take advantage of my feelings. He makes me happy all the time, and makes me laugh too. I’ve never felt love like the way he loves me and all the love he gives to me. He truly taught me what true love is and how it feels to be in love. Like I’ve never loved anyone as much as I love him. He’s also had such a huge impact on me and he has made me so much more stronger and mature. He has shaped me into who I’ve become over these 3 months we’ve been together. I’ve become a better person because of him. So I thank him for that truly he’s amazing!
  
   @edraegen
  
  happy 3 month anniversary my love, I love you!🥺💕 and I appreciate you so much!

   What side of the brain do we use more than the other?
  ","
  We learned about the brain in psychology.
  
  We use the the frontal lobe which controls personality, decision- making & reasoning.
  
  We also use the temporal lobe which controls memory, speech, and sense of smell.
  
  The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and it’s composed of the right and left hemispheres and it performs much higher tasks like interpreting touch, vision, speech, reasoning, emotions, and the control of movement.

  Haha I know, don’t worry 🤗

   How could any respectable man not love posting pics of himself with somebody as fire as you? I feel like you're dating one of those psychos from a movie that charms a girl into making sacrifices and then turns out to be a maniac who ruins her life. It scares me.

  Just because he doesn’t post pictures with me doesn’t mean he’s a psycho silly. He likes his privacy and you should respect that. You guys come up with the craziest things!

   Why does society place such a high value on beauty when it serves no functional purpose? 🤔
  ","
  I think society places such a high value on beauty because it does serve a purpose. Like in the societies eyes if you’re beautiful and have a good body you can model and become famous but that’s wrong because everyone is beautiful in their own ways and every body is beautiful. And like society has an image of what everyone should look like but that’s just messed up because everyone is unique and different in their own ways that’s what makes them beautiful.
  "
978207,"
   Why Most of the people want to live in a denial mode by blaming others for their sufferings rather than admitting their own faults?

   do you think we all use people in our own way just to get to what we need//want?
  ","
  I don’t think everyone necessarily uses someone to get what they need and want but some people do that. Most people have good intentions and a good heart and only want the best for you. But some do use someone and take advantage of their feelings and it’s saddening that they think they can do that. Like once they need or want something from you they will message you because it’s convenient for them at that specific moment but then once they get what they need and want they disappear on you and don’t talk to you.

   A new dating app is launched. Instead of a photo of the person, it shows you a photo of their bedroom, car, kitchen, shoes, how they have their tea/coffee, things like that... what photo would tell you the most about someone, and would you be most interested to see to choose a potential date?

  He came over to my house to pick me up and take me to his and when we got to his place and in front of his door he blindfolded me so that I couldn’t see inside and I thought he was just blindfolding me because he tends to be kinky so I just thought he was being kinky again.  And he took off the blindfold and I saw rose petals on the floor and beautiful flowers and I got distracted as I was looking at all of them. Then I turned around and saw that he was on one knee and he asked Nicole Buckley ( He also used my middle name) will you marry me? I started crying and said yes omg omg yes I will marry you! 🥺 and then we kissed afterwards.

   Do you agree that loneliness can be addictive and therefore dangerous?
  ","
  I mean I feel loneliness can definitely be addictive and dangerous only because you can get so used to being lonely that you wouldn’t want to become and get close to someone both emotionally and physically. And so if you get so used to being lonely you feel it’s just better to be lonely so that you don’t end up getting hurt if you do become attached to someone. So yes, I do agree with that.

   Is it possible to be friends with an ex or would it be too hard?

  Well I think it’s possible if you don’t have feelings towards that person anymore and you love them but only as a friend type of love. Although it could be difficult as well because you still might have the love you used to have for them and their still might be feelings so you should definitely give some time before you try and be friends with an ex.

   If a person was stalking you obsessively and claiming that they are doing that because their love for you is so ""deep and uncontrollable"", how would you get rid of the obsessive admirer and why?

  There’s a show like that called obsession: dark series. People do insanely crazy things when they’re obsessively in love with someone they can’t have or had but they just can’t get over that person. I would honestly try to talk to them first and if that doesn’t do anything and it gets more out of hand I would get the police and FBI involved with the situation.

   When do you think the ability to feel deeply is a downfall and why?
  ","
  Especially when you get deeply attached to someone but they don’t feel the same towards you so when that person leaves it feels like hell and back. Also when you fall deeply in love with someone who might feel the same at that time but then changes and doesn’t feel the same anymore is when you get the most hurt. The ability to feel deeply sometimes hurts so much and causes so much sadness and stress to be honest.

  ","
  I’m a very shy person and I’ve literally tried every method and it hasn’t worked for me. I just think  I’m to socially anxious and nervous to break out of it honestly.
  
  But here are a few methods:
  
  You should do what you can, but accept you may not be able to have the kind of conversation you want with them
  
  Don’t take their quietness personally
  
  Don’t ever comment on how shy or quiet they seem
  
  Take the lead in the conversation but don’t overdo it
  
  Give them a few minutes to warm up to you
  
  Build their self esteem
  
  Use their name
  
  Affirmations
  
  Explore their interests
  
  Offer to help them
  "

979363,"
   How would you describe being in the possession of a mental connection with someone and why? Is it necessary for a human being to have a mental connection with a person in order to converse with them freely?
  ","
  Well being mentally connected with someone means sharing the same interests, similar intellect, and chemistry. Mentally you’re able to feel close to them and you’re able to understand each other well. It also means to have a shared perspective of the world, the fell as if the other person thinks at the same level as you.
  
  Yes, I think it’s incredible if you’re able to have a mental connection with someone because in that way you’re able to talk to them freely and understand one another so well. You will also feel connected to them even if they aren’t physically with you. You will also be able to understand each other’s needs which is amazing.

   “Thinking too much about a decision can lead to analysis paralysis which is the idea that you end up not making a decision at all.” Have you ever thought about making a decision so intensely that you ended up without any decision at all? If yes, then what kind of decision did you have to make?

   Would you be capable of loving a mentally and emotionally unstable person with unconditional love? Why / Why not?

   If you got married but later became a widow, would you ever think about remarrying? 👍
  ","
  This is a very sad question, I mean I honestly don’t think I could remarry after losing my significant other. I would constantly be thinking about them. I don’t think I could do it again after losing someone I loved so much. So yeah, I don’t think I would remarry honestly. I just wouldn’t want to put myself through that again. And Chester Bennington’s  widowed wife got remarried just 2 years after he was gone and I was so shocked and surprised honestly. I still don’t know how it feel about it. Like it’s saddening to think she was able to move on so quickly like wow. 🥴

  Yes, I believe we should so that you can move on from them and when you forgive it will make you feel a whole lot better tbh. You can forgive but never forget.  It just takes a lot of stress out of you when you do forgive your enemies and a lot of weight comes off of you mentally.

   Why do people give up so easily on relationships nowadays? Are we becoming more and more selfish?
  ","
  I feel like a lot of people give up on relationships because they’re scared of commitment and getting really close to someone because they think that person might just leave them. I think a lot of people now a days are just insecure really about romantic relationships because their partner can easily leave or cheat you know? They also give up because maybe they aren’t ready to be in one. There’s many reasons why someone would give up in a relationship.

You’ve made me the happiest I’ve ever been in a long time and I adore you. You are definitely able to handle my crazy heart and most importantly you’re able to handle me. You mean the absolute universe to me and I wouldn’t want to be with anyone else. You’re the one my heart longs for and wants. You’re the only one I see. I love you!

  tbh: you’re the love of my life and you have been making me that happiest I’ve ever been for awhile now. I appreciate you so much and you mean the absolute world to me❤️ I’m extremely lucky to be able to call you mine honestly. It’s like the universe wanted me to be happy and that’s why we met. Faith bought us together I truly believe that. I can’t wait to spend my future with you and to marry you one day and later on have kids together. You showed me what real love is and what love means. I love you more than you love me that’s very true.🥺 I’m just so lucky I can’t believe how lucky I am! You’re my everything and the one I’ve been looking for and I’ve finally found you I couldn’t be happier. I love you so much my love💕

  Well I would understand why you wouldn’t want kids with your ex because they’re part of your past and you’re no longer dating them.

  I personally think it just depends on the person. Like for some people age really matters and they would be bothered if their partner was older but then for others it doesn’t really matter.

  I absolutely hate when people cheat on their significant other. Like that’s just messed up and saddening. I just wonder what is going through their minds when they decide to cheat on their loved one. And then their significant other starts to think negatively like they weren’t good enough or worth it to their partner and that’s sad. I wouldn’t take a cheater back because once they’ve done it what makes you think they won’t do it again? Like I’ve seen it once someone does something they’re very likely going to do it again.

   Which is more important: what you say or how you say it?
  ","
  I think both are really important actually. Like you should always think before you say something and then how you say it so that you don’t intentionally hurt the other person or offend them.

  ","
  Of course I understand. Don’t worry once you find the one you’ll know because she will like you for who you are inside and outside.
  "

   What’s the last thing you criticized?
  ","
  myself
  "
981553,"
   I am sorry I am so negative I feel like it’s just a way of protecting myself from pain. Like I have tried talking to girls before but I always felt like I was a a bother and waste of time to them but then I met this one girl who I thought liked my company but then she found better peopleand left me.
  ","
  I’m sorry you feel that way. I’ve been there as well so I completely understand how you feel. But you have to be confident in yourself and believe in yourself as well. As soon as the right girl comes along you will know because she will like you for who you’re.
  "
981554,"
   Do you miss any of your classmates?
  ","
  not really, no actually
  "

   Have you ever heard a spanish speaker say virus like ""v-roos?""
  ","
  nope
  "
981556,"
   If all girls were as nice as you being myself would be no problem and maybe I would believe I was good enough and worthy of love
  ","
  Awhhh don’t be so negative. You definitely are worthy of love and you’re good enough you just haven’t found the right person yet but you will. You will find love when you least expect it
  "
981557,"
   What ?
  ","
  y’all
  "
981558,"
   I meant like what should guys do to increase their confidence and self-worth in order to have meaningful relationships with women
  ","
  Just believe in yourself and always be yourself! follow your instincts and your heart tbh. And slowly try to be confident in yourself
  "
981559,"
   What if that changed though? What if in one of his past lives he was a little boy who lost his family to the Spanish Flu of 1918 and that what's happening now is giving him flashbacks to that traumatic period.
  ","
  It wouldn’t though
  "
981560,"
   When did you last go and how many people would you estimate were in there?
  ","
  so little! Not many at all! It was empty
  "
981561,"
   So did I but with how its gotten worse in the last day, has it made you rethink that?
  ","
  yeah it has actually
  "
981562,"
   Would you be hesitant to visit the movie theater?
  ","
  I recently did though
  "
981563,"
   Where will you no longer go because you think you could catch the coronavirus there?
  ","
  I haven’t thought about that lol
  "
981564,"
   Honest opinions on guys who believe they have no self worth towards men
  ","
  What do you mean?
  "
981565,"
   For granted? 😅
  ","
  no anon I promise you I’m not
  "
981566,"
   Do you have any body piercings? If so, what are they?
  ","
  Two on each ear lol
  "
981567,"
   Single?
  ","
  nope I’m taken
  "
981568,"
   What if he told you that he was scared and that knowing you were watching him gave him security. Then would you say it was ok?
  ","
  But he wouldn’t because he’s not scared lol
  "
981569,"
   How come you wouldn't want to see more of him like that?
  ","
  no no I respect his privacy anon
  "
981570,"
   For the anon, it just something she likes. A fun thing we do where she has the ""crown"", meaning she loves me more. I have to do something incredible to get the crown from her. It encourages extreme cuteness from the other person. Right now its super hard to get the crown from her, but I try!
  ","
  yeah, see anon we are just being super cute with each other! And yes, I have the crown currently and it’s going to be very hard for you to get it back like very impossible 😋but I love seeing you try!
  "
981571,"
   besides finding someone new how do you recommend getting over somebody?
  ","
  Well I know it takes time to get over someone believe me I would know. But the best thing to do is to try and get closure from the person you’re trying to get over but if they can’t give you closure I suggest you just slowly forgive them and try to forget and think about other things that make you happy. Do things you enjoy so you can keep your mind off of them. And do not look at their social media you should just block them so you don’t get the temptation to look at it. Trust me you’ll get over them it just takes time. The most important thing to do is to go out and do things you enjoy and things that make you happy.
  "
981572,"
   If Edra offered to install a security camera in his room and car so you could observe him whenever you wanted, would you tell him to do it?
  ","
  no I wouldn’t want him to do that
  "
981573,"
   Yeah I know but they remember 20+ years ago. Cellphones existed but everyone didn't have one and stared at it all the time like now
  ","
  yeah, I get what you’re saying
  "
981574,"
   thats a bad thing tho because love in a relationship should be equal, if someone loves the other person more then that person isn’t putting in enough effort
  ","
  No no that’s not true at all. We both put the same amount of effort
  "
981575,"
   Do you ever ask your parents if they liked the world better before everyone had cellphones?
  ","
