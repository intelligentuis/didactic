think it s better to feel everything as opposed to nothing at all . it s good to be enthusiastic , passionate , and dedicated to the things in your life as opposed to going through life without a single emotion whatsoever . negative feelings hurt more , without a doubt , but sometimes it s worth those moments because you also get to experience the great moments as well .","288658":"my day

overlooking snowy mountains and forests with a blanket wrapped around me and a cup of coffee in hand , talking to my partner about anything that comes to mind . just having a sense of tranquility and intimacy on an emotional level .","288719":"you obviously didn t get the memo where i asked for light hearted questions only . i m not up for philosophical questions . i just want something to distract me .","288720":"tbh , probably an animal . human society is sh t and humans have so much contemplation as to the purpose of life and inner feelings , and most other animals don t experience that . they live off of basic instinct .","288721":"this is a boring answer , but probably a cat or a dog . when with the right family , they re treated so well spend their days sleeping , eating , and playing . it s simple and joyous .","288722":"i never thought that much into it , and i m not in the correct mental state rn to contemplate it . some light hearted questions would be appreciated , thanks .","288723":"it exists in society in general . it always has .","288724":"how there are groups of people who are deemed lesser than and inferior to others solely due to the color of their skin , their gender , their sexual orientation , their health or disability , their religion , etc etc . it concerns me that there is little being done to bring justice to those who have experienced wrongdoing , and how people are given little resources to better their lives in a society where it s difficult enough already to sustain oneself .","288725":"will all of this struggle be worth it in the end ?","288726":"depends on what it is and who it s with . i don t like sharing most things in general , but i ll share anything with my boyfriend and close friends .","288727":"generalized

to look into his sh t soon .","288743":"i like going to upstate new york , especially during the autumn and winter months .","288744":"oh , absolutely . i would be able to afford to actually buy a house instead of rent , i could pay off all of my debt , i could actually go on a vacation , etc etc .","288745":"oh , of course . what else is askfm good for ? lmaoo .","288746":"thank you . i don t know you , but i hope you re doing well too . you deserve a loving and healthy relationship .","288747":"that was exactly it . but because i was young , naive , traumatized from past ab se , and looking for affection i accepted it wholeheartedly . i was vulnerable and he took advantage of that . i didn t realize how wrong it was until years later . also my parents did nothing about it either . they accepted him into our home , knowing how old he was and thought that it was normal .","288748":"the worst part , besides the obvious fact that he dated a literal child when he was an adult , was that he went out of his way to message me almost years later to try to get into my pants again . i was livid . he was a disgusting human being .","288749":"in other news everyone who has hbo should watch dan soder s new comedy special . i m crying from laughing so hard rn .","288750":"bingooooo .","288751":"yeah , i agree . i didn t realize how wrong it was until i was older

beautiful .","288754":"no . i can t remember the last time i drank vodka .","288755":"? ? ? i was terrified because my mental health was deteriorating i didn t know how to handle it .","288756":"i usually ignore them . it isn t worth the energy to entertain people who are arrogant , especially if they re so persistent and stubborn in their views that they won t listen to anything else .","288757":"a few months ago . i was terrified for myself , for my future , for my own mental health . my thoughts were too overwhelming and disconcerting , and i was afraid for my own safety .","288758":"rain scenes are always so tranquil to me .","288759":"i was overjoyed the first night i was able to spend in my own house , sleeping in my own bedroom away from my parents . it was a sense of independence that i didn t experience before , and i was overjoyed at the sensation that i was finally living life according to my own terms with no one to answer to except myself .","288760":"uh , zero . at least when it comes to my primary care physician . i only ever see her if i m seriously ill , i . e . if i have the flu or something regular otc medication cannot treat . i see my psychiatrist , on the other hand , every months .","288761":"writing , reading , photography , painting , perusing social media , sleeping , and sometimes seeing my friends if i m in the right mood for it .","288762":"i purchase new clothes perhaps every few months or so ? but it s only one or two pieces , if i need things like new leggings or jeans or a shirt or two . i don t clear out my

to the ads , lmaoo .","288765":"in that case , then i don t really believe that the person had the grounds to invade their privacy , so to speak . it s one thing to know a person intimately and understand that they re acting unusual , and therefore have suspicions that they re cheating and act accordingly . but it s something else completely to log onto their social media accounts solely because their partner wasn t responding quickly enough to text messages .","288766":"my birthday was a few weeks ago , so i received two gift cards for free from various family members ! ! i ended up using them both already for various cold and cough medicines , since i ve been sick . lmaoo .","288767":"being around my family brings out my insecurities , tbh . sometimes they wind up pointing out certain flaws about myself , which makes me even more self conscious . my mother has a bad habit of indicating whether i ve gained or lost weight and even goes into specifics as to where on my body the fat is , and it makes me horribly dysphoric .","288768":"this is one of those gray area things , where both parties are wrong to a certain degree . however , i always side with the person who has been cheated on solely because most people are trusting their gut instinct that something is wrong , otherwise they wouldn t feel justified in invading their partner s privacy to check their messages in the first place . the person who cheated is , obviously , wrong . but i also think that not trusting your partner to not cheat is unfortunately common , and while invading your partner s privacy is wrong in most cases , a case such as this where their feelings were confirmed would justify going through the phone . this has happened to a few friends of mine , where they felt something was wrong so they went through their partner s phone while they were sleeping and discovered that they were messaging other people and or cheating . they knew that going through their phone was wrong in the first place , but they wouldn t have done it had they not already had an idea that something suspicious was going on .","288769":"yes , i wholeheartedly believe that there can still be friendship after love . after a breakup , a person should take the proper steps necessary to be sure that they re over the person they ve dated , so perhaps remaining friends with their ex right away may not work . however , i know of a lot of people who have rekindled their friendships with their exes after the fact , and their friendship is perfectly fine .","288770":"i accidentally cracked the screen of an ipad my boyfriend bought me back in . it still worked , but the crack was pretty bad .","288771":"i believe i m a slow eater , because everyone else around me always finishes their meals much faster than i do , lol .","288772":"my boyfriend , without a doubt . i m comfortable with telling him virtually anything and he has always been my go to person whenever something good or bad has happened in my life .","288773":"no , probably not that sounds a hell of a lot like flirting to me , with the intention of things going further . if i found out that my boyfriend was leading other women or men on like that , i would have to sit down with him and discuss it with him to find out his motive behind doing such things .","288774":"i don t believe any of my books are valuable , actually . they re all books that i picked up from the bookstore or bought off of thriftbooks . com . a few are from amazon , as well .","288775":"i m exhausted of the time , tbh . both mentally and physically .","288776":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","288777":"no , i m not wearing anything yellow . i m wearing a gray heather tee shirt , blue sweatpants , and a blue zip up hoodie .","288778":"ish years . i had just turned years old , and he was years old .","288779":"spinach dip with whole grain chips . i wasn t terribly hungry at all because of how sick i ve been , but i wanted something warm and satisfying .","288780":"i think i legit slept for at least hours last night . i didn t wake up in the middle of the night once at all , and my roommate had to knock on my door multiple times to make sure i was okay . lmaoo .","288781":"i don t ask my spam to myself , lol . my spam is for the people i follow .","288782":"no , i never felt obligated to stay in any of my relationships . i also only broke up with one person , lol . my relationship prior to that one , my girlfriend had broken up with me . when i broke up with my ex , it was because i realized that i didn t actually love him . i just loved the idea of him , and i didn t like spending time with him as much as i convinced myself that i was . he also lied to me on multiple occasions , and it was a toxic relationship considering our age difference . i didn t stay out of obligation , so i broke up with him .","288783":"no , that s not wrong at all . if you don t love him to the same degree that he loves you you don t feel as if there s anything further you can do to strengthen the relationship , then there s nothing wrong with ending the relationship . you need to look after your own happiness , and if you re not happy , then you need to make the necessary changes in order to attain happiness again . there s no shame in that . don t stay with someone out of guilt they deserve to know the truth , as hard as it would be to hear .","288784":"lol . honestly , i don t know how your body functions but if you re leaving a mess all over the seat , then that s disgusting . at least my roommates have the decency to clean up after themselves .","288785":"i also wipe my own ass after i take a sh t what s your point ? lol .","288786":"i absolutely hate cleaning the bathroom , lmaoo . it s satisfying once i m done , but i find it so gross . i clean the house times per week , which includes vacuuming , wiping down the counters , mopping the floor , dusting the furniture , etc etc . we try to vacuum , in particular , at least twice per week because of the cats .","288787":"i just finished cleaning the house doing the dishes , y all should ask me some questions ! !","288788":"yeah , movies about the united states the justice system are so far removed from the truth . there is little justice for many people , especially minority groups in the united states , and often offenders walk free from their crimes . especially if they re lawyers , politicians , or basically anyone who s in a position of power and has wealth .","288789":"i wholeheartedly agree not only in the united states , but the society in the world as a whole . there s a deeply rooted sense of toxic masculinity and patriarchy that have pervaded society for centuries .","288790":"i actually don t support the death penalty at all , but i m all in support of vigilante justice . haha . i think the death penalty is an easy way out for criminals , and they deserve to rot away in solitary confinement instead .","288791":"not really , no . i ve never been a youtuber i just watch gaming videos , haha . i think it is important , however , to try to engage yourself with other youtubers by commenting on posts , and promoting yourself on other social media pages .","288792":"i haven t heard about it until just now . i m glad that the suspects were k lled , though . the victim did not deserve what happened to her and maybe her family can get some closure now .","288793":"yes , that s another thing too . often women aren t heard they re also afraid to speak out about the assault in fear of others not believing them which happens in most cases , smh . it also leaves them vulnerable to another assault , and women are afraid to voice their trauma because they might be assaulted again , either by the same person or someone else . it s absolutely disgusting how backwards the system is in the united states . it s like the victims are being punished instead of the offenders . there s more emphasis on the tarnished image of the accused than there is on the well being of the survivor .","288794":"there are r pists all over the united states . the justice system does absolutely nothing for the victims survivors of the assault , and often the r pists walk free or get minimal jail time .","288795":"women aren t afraid of sex . women are afraid of being r ped and m rdered by men .","288796":"i m absolutely terrible at both singing and dancing .","288797":"no , i ve never been interested in the whole miss universe miss america thing , or any sort of beauty pageant .","288798":"home remedies have never worked for me . i can drink all of the ginger tea i want , it s not going to make me feel better as an example . in the past , i ve always used saline spray , but the type of illness i have rn requires more care than just something for my sinuses .","288799":"i don t have the flu , and if i got the flu shot now , it wouldn t be effective assuming i do develop the flu .","288800":"considering i need money to survive every day , and it s the foundation behind my food , shelter , and health yes . money matters to me very much .","288801":"freezing cold , coughing up phlegm , and sneezing like a mo fucka . i went to the drug store and picked up robitussin , dayquil , nyquil , and cough drops so i m hoping to nip this cold cough thing in the bud , because i ve been feeling this way since tuesday .","288802":"i don t believe it s hypocritical at first glance , because you simply don t know a person s situation and the reason why they don t have a job in the first place . they may not have a job because of other obligations , i . e . taking care of family members or children , being disabled , etc etc . generally , i do believe that if someone has the capability to hold a job and they re not preoccupied by being a parent or a caregiver , then they may want to join the workforce , even just part time . it s good to be doing something with your life and it will make you feel more productive . but if you don t need a job because you re financially secure , then you re not obligated to have one .","288803":"you re sending this to multiple people , and that s a bit weird . then again , when i was years old like you , i always did look up to older individuals for validation as well .","288804":"i don t really believe in luck , so neither . i ve gone through both terrible things and great things , and the reason why i ve felt accomplished in my endeavors is because i ve kept pushing forward despite my circumstances .","288805":"in the united states , getting a college education is hella expensive , and the reason why some people only earn a high school diploma is because they cannot afford college . tuition is normally tens of thousands of dollars , and when you take out a loan for college tuition , you re normally paying it back for years per month . it has nothing to do with the fact that some people may be willingly uneducated . most people want a college education , but they don t have the means to do so .","288806":"i know absolutely nothing about the architecture industry .","288807":"being a physician apparently has the highest salary in the united states , followed by architects , lawyers , and engineers .","288808":"i don t know anyone who s wealthy or anything , but i have a few acquaintances who had rough beginnings and worked themselves higher and higher until they reached their goals and established themselves successfully , both personally and professionally .","288809":"yeah , i use my regular phone camera sometimes because the quality is much better than the quality through snapchat .","288810":"probably one of my old coworkers who has been working towards her phd . she has a plethora of knowledge just sitting in her head , she s very intelligent and can verbalize her thoughts and opinions well , and her writing is on point .","288811":"definitely not , lmaoo . i m basically average in terms of intelligence and my finances .","288812":"i used to be quite submissive when it came to my perspectives , my interactions with other people , etc etc . i was very non confrontational . but as i ve grown older , i ve learned to grasp the idea of being forthcoming not really dominant in a sense , but definitely more sturdy and stubborn in the way i present myself .","288813":"i ve never really been able to pinpoint why . i have generalized anxiety disorder , so random things like driving and talking on the phone are a few of the things that make my anxiety spike .","288814":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope you re having a great weekend too","288815":"hi , i am one of those people sometimes , people experience phone anxiety and find it difficult to talk to others on the phone . i m only comfortable talking to my boyfriend , best friend , and parents on the phone , and the idea of talking to anyone else gives me major anxiety .","288816":"somewhat , yes . it took me a long time to learn to trust my boyfriend , and my lack of trust of people in general triggered a lot of paranoia both warranted and unwarranted .","288817":"even though he was the mayor of new york city for quite some time , i m not all too familiar with his political social stances .","288818":"yeah , i have major trust issues . i suppose it all stems from my childhood with my parents i learned early on that i could not trust them with my personal things , because often they invaded my privacy and would use the private information they learned against me .","288819":"it s been all right so far . i ve only been awake for around hours , and i ve been sitting at my laptop perusing various websites for christmas shopping , drinking coffee , and listening to music . i have to go to my parents house later , but i m still pretty sick so i m debating on cancelling on them since i don t want to spread my germs around their house , especially since my mother s immune system is so low . i also have to go to the bank and pharmacy , but i m hoping i feel better enough in a few hours to gain the motivation to go .","288820":"i would simply cut them out of my life completely . i have the ability to detach myself just as easily as i can attach myself , especially when coming upon the realization that they re not reciprocating my levels of commitment and energy .","288821":"both , depending on my mood and how i ve been feeling on that particular day . i know that rationally , i need to act on things that bother me but there have been other times when i ve tried to ignore or suppress those feelings because i feel too overwhelmed to handle them .","288822":"yes , i do have an addictive personality in that i become obsessed easily with certain things , as well as people . i ve jumped from addiction to addiction throughout my life , between self destructive methods of coping to drugs to alcohol to smoking . i also have the tendency to become overly attached to certain people , and that s mainly because of my borderline personality disorder .","288823":"yes ! ! i ve hung out with courtney she used to be courrtana on here when she was still active . we both lived in new york at the time , so we hung out twice .","288824":"no , i m not . i m only buying gifts for my irl friends and family .","288825":"etsy is a website you can visit to purchase handmade , unique products from self sufficient small businesses and artists . you re directly dealing with an individual or group of people instead of a large corporation . it s incredibly versatile and it s a great website to visit if you re looking for customized gifts for the holidays , birthdays , etc etc .","288826":"most of the shops i bought from actually still have sales going on , so i did save some money here and there . i didn t do any cyber monday shopping because i was at work all day , and honestly , i totally forgot about it . lmaoo .","288827":"like nothing i could have ever dreamed about , in the very beginning . alongside the obvious infatuation , i felt completely loved and supported in all possible ways and garnered a feeling of safety unlike anything i ve ever experienced before . i felt understood and validated , like my thoughts and feelings actually mattered for once , and there was a consideration of my emotions and a valid response that i wasn t familiar with . we have similar interests and passions , and those passions and hobbies melded into each other . he felt like an extension of myself , and we were both amplified .","288828":"no , i ve been purchasing items from etsy for years upon years . delivery is usually between weeks , depending on how unique the item is . most items on etsy are tailored to what you specifically request or are handmade , so the businesses artists require more time to create the product .","288829":"i thought i fell in love at the age of , but after experiencing real love for the first time , i realized it was simply a deep infatuation . i fell in love with my boyfriend when i was years old .","288830":"yeah , i don t disagree . lol .","288831":"for my boyfriend , i bought a mug w a cichlid on it a bearded dragon tee shirt . for my brother , i bought a shirt w a bunny on it he just got a new rabbit . for my cousin , i bought a betta fish mom shirt . for my aunt , i bought a steel decor that says love with a horseshoe . for my boyfriend s dad , i bought a watercolor print of the wineries on long island . for my close friend , i bought a wine glass that says wine now , gym later and a workout tank top . and for my best friend , i bought a customized harry potter mug that looks like us sitting in front of hogwarts . . . . whew .","288832":"so , i m trying to shop for christmas gifts mainly on etsy this year because i like supporting small artists businesses . i just dropped so much money on gifts this morning , lmaoo . but they re all unique items and i m excited to see my friends family s reactions ! !","288833":"it doesn t bother me at all , except for when i m the only one who is sober . depending on my mood , it can irritate me if my friends are being obnoxiously drunk and even sloppy . however , i also tend to feel very protective of my drunk friends because i don t want anyone to take advantage of them .","288834":"it didn t happen to me directly , but during my party stage of my life when i was around to years old , my friends and i threw a house party . at the time , we were also into stealing random objects from the street and other people s properties , i . e . orange cones and barrels . we had a bunch of cones lined up inside of this kid s house , and one of my friends was drunk and stupidly decided to see if he could stab a cone right through with his knife . because he was drunk , the knife slipped and he sliced all the way through his thumb . he nearly passed out in the house because he doesn t like the sight of blood , so we hoisted him into my car and i sped him off to the emergency room . i didn t go into the triage with him , but apparently the nurses had a good laugh when my friend had to tell them how he sliced his finger . lmaoo .","288835":"not my own neighbors , no . but my boss neighbors yes . lmaoo . he hosted a work party over the summer and nearly everyone in the company showed up , and there was a lot of music and dancing . apparently one of his neighbors was disturbed , even though it wasn t even pm yet , and called the cops and the cops came in through the back gate to check everything out . it was pretty funny , tbh .","288836":"last year , i did a fundraiser for the national s icide hotline . but i ve also heard that facebook doesn t allocate the money accordingly and the charities apparently don t see much of the money at all ? it s really suspicious , so i haven t done it since .","288837":"yesterday , i went to work and caught up on all of the work i missed when i was out sick on thursday . it was an incredibly busy day . then i ran an errand after work , went home , heated up leftovers for dinner , and sat on my laptop for a little while . one of my roommates came home , so we shared a drink and set up christmas decorations .","288838":"i fill empty glasses with wine , yes .","288839":"yes , i believe i did hear that at one point ! ! i don t know if they re actually making it , though . i haven t heard anything else in a while .","288840":"no , i don t have a girlfriend . i have a boyfriend .","288841":"i ve had a few thousand accrued on a credit card bill before .","288842":"interesting ! ! idk , i never saw his larger print books before . i also haven t read a stephen king novel in a long time . the last one i read was just after sunset , i believe .","288843":"the fonts of certain books bother me at times , so if something is in large print , it would turn me off from a book .","288844":"this describes half of my emails at work , lmaoo .","288845":"no , i ve never tried crocheting or knitting . i m not really into crafting very much either .","288846":"lol , no . i switch on off between spotify and youtube , particularly when i m looking for ambient soundtracks that i can write to . youtube has a lot of ambient channels that mix soundtrack songs with sounds of rain , thunder , crackling fire , etc etc .","288847":"right now , i m listening to some two feet billie eilish . same old song two feet https www . youtube . com watch ? v tqbwpujaz i","288848":"hi friends , i have the house to myself i m blasting music . ask me some questions","288849":"yes , without a doubt . especially if i knew that what i was reaching towards would help me , make me happier , make me more content with myself and my life , etc etc . whatever risk would happen it would be worth it .","288850":"it typically doesn t . if i have a falling out with a friend , then my feelings towards them have switched off long ago and something broke the last straw in order for me to cut them off completely . then i move on with my life .","288851":"no , i believe the world has always been semi aggressive to an extent . it s just more publicized now .","288852":"i ve had deliveries be a tad bit late before because of a regular sale , but that was all . it wasn t a big deal to me .","288853":"taking time out of your day to reveal to someone you love how much you appreciate their presence in your life . it can completely turn around a person s mood , knowing that they re important to someone and feeling validated appreciated for what they ve done in the friendship and or relationship .","288854":"thanks to my lovely borderline personality disorder , i have always struggled with finding an identity . throughout my life , i ve darted between groups of people and have adopted their personalities and lifestyles , without ever developing a unique sense of self that i can call my own .","288855":"will this pain be worthwhile ? has everything i worked towards going to be worth the heartache i ve endured ?","288856":"yes , i wholeheartedly believe that pure happiness is attainable . sometimes , it s the only hope i have that keeps me going on rough days the belief that i can , and will , be genuinely happy one day .","288857":"all i want for christmas is stable mental health .","288858":"i ve always thought that experiences were much better , wholesome christmas gifts than material objects . like , buying her a certificate to a spa or a play musical or a concert . maybe plan a vacation for the two of you to get away together for a weekend and surprise her with it . even something as simple as a voucher for dinner and a movie .","288859":"hobo chic , lmaoo . i don t really have that much of a fashion sense or style , though . it changes every day . some days , i ll be trendy and wear dark wash skinny jeans with knee high boots and an oversized sweater with a beanie . other days , i ll wear ripped plaid pants with combat boots and a leather jacket . during the summer , i sometimes wear patchwork skirts with tank tops and flowy blouses . i ve never had a defined style .","288860":"ah , it s a difficult choice between interview with the vampire heathers the crow american psycho girl interrupted","288861":"depends on my mood in that moment , tbh . lately i ve been listening to some hip hop .","288862":"i haven t done much today besides go to work and heat up something to eat , lol . i ve held doors open for people in my office building , i loaded up the dishwasher so that my roommate didn t have to do it before getting ready to leave , and that s really it . i ll probably treat myself to some hot chocolate later because i m hella cold today , but other than that , not much .","288863":"yes , i used to have reoccurring dreams on almost a nightly basis when i was a teenager . they were almost always the same dreams or so , just on a constant rotating basis .","288864":"i don t really have techniques per say , but just a certain order in which i do things . i dust the living room , bathroom and bedroom first , then i wipe down the kitchen and bathroom , and sweep all of the floors . then , i vacuum all of the rooms . sometimes i ll throw some nice smelling powder down on the rug and vacuum it up so that the house smells fresh .","288865":"my diagnosed panic disorder makes me panic , lmaoo . it can be for simple things , or more complex things . if i m experiencing sensory overload and my anxiety is already heightened , a panic attack can be triggered . if i m just thinking about something or feel claustrophobic , mentally or physically , it can trigger a panic attack . sometimes i cannot leave the house because i m afraid of having a panic attack in public because i dislike crowds of people .","288866":"haha , no . i m not exactly a dancing singing performance sort of person .","288867":"i m excited to have the house all to myself tonight after my roommate goes out and sees his girlfriend . it s a nice feeling to be

with , and for some students , their grades could drop if they work a job at the same time since they re not committing themselves to studying . however . . . i also believe it s important to hold a job and study simultaneously , if you have the capability to do so . juggling multiple tasks at once is a useful skill for the future , and if you can successfully dedicate your time to work and school at the same time , then that s a really strong talent to utilize . not to mention the obvious fact that it always feel nice to earn your own money .","288873":"i have never heard of a tic bill

definition of insanity , but i do believe that it s counter productive to repeat the same things and expect different results each time . we should learn and grow from our mistakes , taking different approaches when something doesn t work .","288919":"just a snapchat selfie .","288920":"this isn t true , but okay . my boyfriend isn t controlling or ab sive by any means , and he understands that i

not necessarily bad either . however , i don t even remember most of my dreams unless they re really significant .","289060":"my only reoccurring dream is something that s too grotesque and morbid to describe on askfm .","289061":"two , normally . i have a heavy down comforter and a fleece blanket .","289062":"it s important to be selfish in order to preserve yourself from potential harm , whether it s emotional or physical . i place a lot of significance on self care and doing what s best for yourself in circumstances where you re placed in a tough position , whether it s by friends , your partner , or your family . your feelings and wellness are most important and you should take care of yourself when necessary . you should be selfless when someone else is hurt or in harm s way , especially if they re a person who relies on you to help them . if you re in a position where you re comfortable enough to help them , i believe putting your own needs on the back burner and helping them is the right thing to do .","289063":"natasha lyonne .","289064":"i believe that if someone tells you something in confidence , you should stick to your promise and not tell a single soul . however , if that person is at risk of harming themselves and or someone else , i think it s justified to reveal that secret for the betterment of their own safety granted the secret is in relation to what they re planning on doing .","289065":"when i m severely lacking sleep anything less than hours , then i normally chug coffee and energy drinks to remain awake , lmaoo .","289066":"moving into the new house with two roommates , away from my parents house , was the last life changing decision i made . i don t regret a thing , and i feel as if i m thriving in this new household . i feel completely independent and i ve been writing creatively again . i have renewed motivation in my life .","289067":"if that happened to me , then i would simply be amused .","289068":"i quit smoking in august , lol","289069":"yeah , but not on purpose .","289070":"no , i don t .","289071":"yeah , i have no doubt in my mind that humans will perish .","289072":"lol , yeah i use it for most of my selfies . it s technically mirror imaging , but double imaging is also a term too . idk why it appeals to me so much . i like the symmetry , and it s a lot more aesthetically pleasing than if i were to just put the black or white borders on the size to make it a image .","289073":"it isn t shameful , bad , or weak to reach out for help when you need it . there s no such thing as reaching out too late , and looking for help when you re in need will only serve you in the long run . everyone needs help on occasion , and if there is someone in your life who is averse to helping you meaning they simply don t want to , not that they can t , then their presence in your life isn t necessary anymore . i should have reached out for help over years ago . i thought that there was no use in helping me , there wasn t anything i could be helped with , even though i was in substantial pain . when i did seek help a few years ago , though , it was absolutely life changing . looking for help is not weak . it s strength .","289074":"i m interested in a lot of various things writing , reading , television shows , movies , art , photography , social justice politics , music , etc etc .","289075":"canva is great ! ! it s absolutely free , and i make all of my text posts for instagram on there like my poetry other writings .","289076":"? ? ? you can love and be passionate about animals while simultaneously understanding that not everyone has the capacity to be vegan .","289077":"i don t know if i even want to be vegan , tbh . i think i would have much better luck with vegetarianism . i have disordered eating habits as it is , so i m taking my time with this and seeing where it leads .","289078":"no , i m not vegan . i have been buying healthier , more plant based alternatives compared to what my parents used to buy , though . veggie patties , almond milk , etc etc . i still eat eggs and whatnot , but i m not having meat almost every night like how i used to eat .","289079":"i mean , it s common for couples to argue . but if you re continuously arguing about the same thing over over , then that s an indication that there has been no growth or progress . there s no learning from the argument or understanding that things need to be changed in order to be better . you need to have open communication with your partner in order for things to truly work , and that also involves acknowledging when someone is wrong and taking the necessary steps to change .","289080":"idk if any of you guys have ever had the displeasure of smelling the stench of bearded dragon feces , but . . . it is absolutely atrocious .","289081":"there was a time when my boyfriend and i broke up temporarily for about a month or two while i was in college . in that period of time , my roommate encouraged me to go out on a date with this one guy who was in my literature class . i was hesitant for obvious reasons , but i figured why not . so , we go to a cute cafe close to campus and everything was fine , albeit awkward for me . eventually , i ended up breaking down and confessed to the guy everything that was going wrong in my life , including my relationship and the serious struggles my boyfriend was enduring at the time . lmaoo . luckily the guy was really responsive to it all and helped me out , he reassured me that things will look up . he wasn t angry or bitter about it at all , but nevertheless , we didn t talk after that .","289082":"it looks absolutely ridiculous , lol . it s almost comical .","289083":"i used canva , it s a design app that helps you make advertisements and other graphics for social media . i m not tech savvy at all , lmaoo .","289084":"hello , internet","289085":"i have one brother . we re not close or anything , but we ve definitely began talking more often as we ve gotten older .","289086":"no , i m years old . i m considered a millennial .","289087":"yeah , you can share it . i don t feel comfortable with my username being associated with it , though . you can copy paste my response or screenshot it if you d like , i just kindly ask that my username be omitted .","289088":"no , my day has been consumed by coffee . lmaoo .","289089":"this isn t a complete question i have no idea what you re trying to say .","289090":"no , i don t have an interest in dating someone who s a parent .","289091":"my best features , in my opinion , are my eyes . my boyfriend s best features are his arms , back , and smile .","289092":"i don t know a thing about provisional governments .","289093":"it confuses me why this is news for some people , lmaoo . i ve had half of my head shaved since february .","289094":"my natural hair is like a dark blonde .","289095":"yes , microaggressions are very real and very commonplace . they re often done unconsciously because it has been ingrained in a person since childhood , whether it s due to parental influences or society or both . it s been studied upon in psychological practices for ages and microaggressions are detrimental to the rights of minority groups , or groups that have experienced oppression through the ages .","289096":"things will not get better unless you put in the effort to make things better for yourself . you cannot sit around and wait for life to begin looking up you have to put the work and effort into creating a better life . and i m aware that it s difficult , and not everyone may have the right opportunity to do so , but you cannot expect a better life while remaining stagnant in your own thoughts and actions .","289097":"i think they re equally as bad , depending on whether or not the couple places importance on dates such as those .","289098":"dream books have said that dreams nightmares about teeth , particularly teeth falling out , are a sign of major stress or change . i used to have those dreams a lot when i was younger . these days , i don t remember most of my dreams to begin with .","289099":"yes , i love candles actually . i have one lit rn .","289100":"no . i don t wear perfume because most of them are incredibly heavy and irritate me .","289101":"i broke a promise to myself a few weeks ago . i told myself a long time ago that i wouldn t do something in light of my own safety and security , but a few weeks ago i broke that promise did it anyway . i broke a promise to someone else last year . similarly , i told them that i wouldn t do something but i ended up giving in and did the thing , but in secret . they still don t know that i broke that promise and i don t think i ll ever have the courage to tell them .","289102":"they taught me the value of heartbreak and that , regardless of the pain i m enduring , there will always be a brightness eventually . even if i m broken internally , i ve learned that time does mend most wounds , and sometimes one door closing can only lead to another door opening in the future . you have to endure some struggle to gain a realization of what you truly want and need .","289103":"he s different from others in that he has stood by my side , supported me , and made strides to understand me on a personal level whereas everyone else in my life was quick to brush off my insecurities and mental illnesses because it was too much of a burden on them . he s had an innate understanding of my struggles from when i was a child through deep conversations , and instead of distancing himself because he didn t know how to handle it , he pushed forward and opened himself up to methods by which he could make things easier for me . we ve gone through hell and back together , although that s a cliche way to really put it . we ve endured struggle , addiction , death , as well as celebrations together . we ve hit milestones together in terms of graduations and have watched people come and go from each other s lives , and he has been the one of the few people in my life who have been there through everything . he has inspired passion in me and encouraged me to delve deep into my craft writing . he s always been my number one fan and makes me so deeply proud of my writing , and his support is one of the few things that pushes me forward to write more .","289104":"paradise , in my eyes , is having a tranquil span of time with a loved one where you experience no hardships , no real responsibilities , and can simply bask in each other s presence and appreciate one another for who you actually are . i believe that life is often so busy and chaotic that we lose sight of what s truly important to us , including people in our lives , and very rarely do we all get to sit down with the people we love and express to them our gratitude or connect on an intimate basis .","289105":"i don t believe everyone buys things they don t need , at least not on a constant basis . however , there is that pressure in society today to purchase unnecessary items simply because they re on sale . and there is also a lot of push from corporations themselves to buy products and appeal to the masses by exploitation .","289106":"i use uber when i m going out into town for a drink , that way i don t have to worry about driving myself in case i end up getting drunk . everywhere else , i drive myself i don t really go anywhere , though , just to work and to the grocery store and pharmacy . i ve only ever taken the bus on a few occasions , but i prefer taxis because i m so impatient when it comes to all of the stops the bus has to make . i also don t really walk anywhere because there isn t anything in walking distance from my house .","289107":"tbh , i never did the research to see whether or not companies increased prices just to mark them down for the sake of calling it a sale . i have no doubt that the practice exists , though . regardless , i don t take part in black friday shopping . sales also don t encourage me to buy things i don t need either . as a general rule , i try to only buy things that i do need at some point , whether it s immediate or in the future . i only splurge on myself on the very rare occasion .","289108":"has been both wonderful and devastating , simultaneously . i ve made great strides in certain areas of my life , but also had a lot of setbacks . however , regardless of what has happened , i m still trying to go into with a fresh mindset and positive thoughts .","289109":". . . i knew this was going to lead into some gross fetish sh t . smh .","289110":"burgundy plaid leggings , a black tank top , and a black zip up hoodie .","289111":"if i wanted to , then i don t see why not .","289112":"my natural rival is my own damn self .","289113":"not really , tbh . perhaps it s more than some other people , but compared to how i used to drink which was getting plastered , blackout every night , what i do now is mild .","289114":"i started reading mindhunter inside the fbi s elite serial crime unit by john e . douglas about a month ago .","289115":"no , i don t drink nearly as much water as i should be drinking .","289116":"lol . i ll take that as a compliment thank you very much .","289117":"of course tbh , i wouldn t be at my current job if they weren t comfortable with unnatural hair colors , tattoos , piercings , etc etc . my job is in the publishing field and i work in a creative department , so there are a good handful of us who have dyed hair and tattoos and piercings . it isn t a reflection of our work ethic .","289118":"lol . you make it seem as if i m always hungover , when that s rarely the case . i m sorry that you ve witnessed other people have such a poor relationship with alcohol trust me , i ve definitely been in your shoes too , but there is such a thing as having a healthy relationship with drinking and learning how to drink in moderation . it isn t for everyone , obviously , and a lot of people are much better off not drinking at all . but there s nothing wrong with having fun every now and again if you re responsible with it .","289119":"yes , the american heart association recommends that everyone reaches around , steps per day .","289120":"i don t generally get into arguments , so i don t remember . if anything , i ll get into little heated discussions with others but i don t emotionally attach myself to the discussion enough for me to be overly angry about it . if something is going down the wrong way , then i just step away .","289121":"it s normal and healthy to care about yourself , and there should be more importance placed on caring for yourself before you re okay enough to care for other people . often times , we take on responsibilities of caring for the other people in our lives before we look after our own selves , which leaves us feeling exhausted and destroyed .","289122":"definitely not , lol . i don t even purchase perfume now , let alone spend almost on a single bottle .","289123":"if i ordered online , then it wouldn t arrive before tomorrow afternoon . i don t really know what i want to get him , at any rate . i figure i would walk around the store and see what catches my eye . i also want to get him a birthday card and a gift card .","289124":"aw ! ! lol , thank you so much . once i started shaving my head , i couldn t stop because it felt so much like me , if that makes any sense too . i would never shave my entire head because i love having hair to play with and color , but having the shaved side and the undercut on the other side has always been so fun .","289125":"no , i am not a twin .","289126":"oh , lol . yes , i took that picture two days ago .","289127":"according to social media , the first picture i posted of half my head shaved was in february .","289128":"thank you ! ! i hope you re having a good weekend as well . i m doing fine , just recovering from a hangover from last night lol . i m supposed to go to the store today and pick up some items for my brother s birthday tomorrow , but i feel terrible so i m probably going to do it either later tonight or tomorrow morning before we go out to dinner .","289129":"no , he doesn t have children or a wife or anything of the sort . he s never wanted kids , either .","289130":"it wasn t meant to be an undercut on that side of my head . i purposely shaved it to where my part was .","289131":"when i used to wear my fitbit , it tracked my daily steps and calories burned and whatnot . i haven t worn it in a while , but i believe i walked around steps per day .","289132":"i would love to learn how to play the piano . it s one of my favorite instruments because of how beautiful and versatile the sounds can be . piano music moves me like no other .","289133":"some of my favorite hobbies include writing , reading , watching television , playing video games , painting , and photography .","289134":"no , i definitely wouldn t enjoy being famous . i m a very anti social person to begin with and i don t like being recognized in public , so to be surrounded by fans or people who otherwise know me isn t appealing at all . it would only make me anxious .","289135":"victorian era post mortem photographs , also called death photography , has always been incredibly interesting to me . it s an obscure and taboo practice and is now seen as disrespectful to the dead , but i still find it very alluring to research and read about . i was going to post a photo of it to accompany my answer , but they re really disturbing to look at and i don t think my followers would have appreciated it , lol .","289136":"i think my obvious answer would be a dog or cat , lmaoo . when they re in a stable , healthy home then they essentially have the best lives ever . i would absolutely love to do nothing all day except eat , sleep , and play .","289137":"honesty and communication , as well as showing that you re emotionally open and vulnerable . there s nothing more attractive than being with someone who is open with themselves regarding their feelings and is willing to discuss those feelings with you in order to make better sense of them .","289138":"arrogance is perhaps the number one thing that immediately turns me off from a person . it s one thing to be confident in a healthy manner , but when that confidence turns into being conceited to the point where you believe other people are below you , that s a problem and it s not healthy or attractive .","289139":"no , i am in a relationship .","289140":"as my bio indicates , i am from new york .","289141":"no , i don t generally hate people because i believe hate is a very strong word . i purge my facebook friends list on a regular basis of people i don t interact with , so i don t really think there is anyone on my facebook that i dislike .","289142":"i normally do most of my holiday shopping online as opposed to in store . especially when it comes to cyber monday deals on certain websites that i ve purchased from in the past .","289143":"well , perhaps not for everyone but for like of people on this earth , i would . i have no sympathy for people like r pists , nazis , or p dophiles .","289144":"if you re in a healthy relationship , then really you shouldn t need to feel the compulsion to hide money from your partner . i think the only way hiding money would be reasonable would be if you were in an ab sive relationship and were saving up that money to leave .","289145":"lately , i have been somewhat i ve been washing my hands every few hours and using hand sanitizer and lysol spray wipes , solely because everyone around me is sick rn and i cannot afford to get sick .","289146":"yes , unfortunately i do know some people who are racist .","289147":"yeah , a few of my friends ex partners are on my sh tlist , lmaoo .","289148":"love is a temporary madness , it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides . and when it subsides , you have to make a decision . you have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part . because this is what love is . love is not breathlessness , it is not excitement , it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion , it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day , it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body . no , don t blush , i am telling you some truths . that is just being in love , which any fool can do . love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away , and this is both an art and a fortunate accident . louis de berni res .","289149":"i haven t really looked up what new games are coming out or have come out recently . i ve been thinking about getting back into destiny , though .","289150":"no , i ve never used a memory foam mattress . i treated myself to a posturepedic mattress when i moved into the new house , and honestly my sleep has been amazing .","289151":"yes , i absolutely love guacamole . especially when there s a hint of spiciness to it .","289152":"well , last night i went out with one of my close friends to celebrate her birthday . today i m planning on completing some freelance work and do household chores , and tomorrow , i m going to a restaurant to celebrate my brother s birthday .","289153":"the blonde is gone , thankfully . i colored it a dark brown with caramel tones . i guess my shaved head isn t visible in my other photos ? i ve had my head shaved for over a year now , lol .","289154":"of course ! ! i ve been shaving my head for over a year now .","289155":"? ? ? we are his family , lol .","289156":"he was welcomed , but he couldn t go . he had his own family obligations .","289157":"my brother was there too .","289158":"uh , i d like to think that i m a nice person . that may not necessarily be the truth though .","289159":"i m not interested in being friends with you .","289160":"no , i m not married . i m in a long term relationship .","289161":"the last thing i wrote by hand was a birthday card , i filled it out for my friend s birthday . my handwriting is atrocious , tbh . it s a mixture of both print and cursive , but it s really all over the place .","289162":"my thanksgiving was good , surprisingly . i just got home from my parents house there were no arguments or fussing around . i was only there for three hours , and i just got home now . my favorite dish was the apple pie , lmaoo .","289163":"we had turkey , green beans , corn , carrots , turnips , and stuffing . there was also mashed potatoes , but i didn t eat any .","289164":"i m doing fine . just finished eating dinner at my parents house .","289165":"i m from new york .","289166":"hello do you have a question ?","289167":"i m currently at my parents house and my family is having dinner together .","289168":"i didn t eat lunch today so i could prepare myself for dinner , haha .","289169":"thank you ! ! i hope you had a great day too .","289170":"i ve had it shaved for over a year , lmaoo . you re obviously new .","289171":"i don t believe it works that way , lol . regardless of where i m living , i m still struggling to find myself .","289172":"a video i saw on facebook of a woman doing interpretive dance while topless in a cemetery .","289173":"i m currently writing the most vulnerable , personal , heartfelt , and revealing piece of creative non fiction that i ve ever sat down to write . i feel as if i m exposing myself for all to see , despite the fact that only my eyes have seen it thus far . i hope i eventually become comfortable enough to publish this piece because i m proud of what i ve written so far . it s a true telling of my story with mental illness , but it s left me feeling afraid .","289174":"it s thanksgiving , and i ve always celebrated it with my family . i feel obligated to go , mostly to keep the peace because i know that if i didn t go , i would be given hell .","289175":"no , they don t get in the way of me answering questions or anything so it doesn t bother me .","289176":"yeah , i have a small amount of ads when i m on the app on my phone . however , when i m using askfm on my laptop like i am rn , there are ads literally everywhere .","289177":"she shaved me on a , i believe . i still have decent stubble .","289178":"no , they re the same sections as they always were . i just got a fresh buzz on tuesday .","289179":"thank you , i appreciate it ! !","289180":"tbh , i m feeling pretty relaxed motivated rn . pensive , even . it s been a quiet morning early afternoon filled with coffee and writing . my anxiety got the best of me in light of the holiday and i ended up taking half a tab of xanax , which helped a lot . i m extremely nervous about spending time with my family tonight , but hopefully the visit will be harmless and short .","289181":"yeah , it doesn t phase me . i ve been called a b tch my entire life . after a while , it doesn t mean anything anymore .","289182":"to provide myself with a semblance of a jawline , obviously .","289183":"androgynous , borderline b tchhhh .","289184":"i don t personally see why not . i don t exactly see the purpose of black friday except that it s a huge sale day for christmas , and christmas is celebrated worldwide .","289185":"as you got older , there were days of cold surrender , days of shrugged whatevers folded in with days of shocking splendor . but as time advanced , the lovely days were covered up from view by an advancing melancholy haze that hovered near the dew . https www . youtube . com watch ? v h itorotkfc","289186":"happy thanksgiving to you as well ! !","289187":"not to my knowledge . to be fair , i m not all that intelligent , lmaoo . i just know how to express myself well in writing . i m a bit of a ditz in real life , it takes me some time to get certain jokes and i m very up in the clouds unless i m intently focusing on something , like at work .","289188":"depends on how you define intelligence . we re intelligent in different ways , tbh . i m more book smart while he s more street smart , and he also knows a hell of a lot more about things such as animals , cooking , history , music , the trades like carpentry , plumbing , hvac , etc etc , and more . meanwhile , most of my knowledge is stuff i learned in college regarding writing and literature , lol . i m a much better writer than he is , but he s also pretty good when it comes to creative writing . he seldom writes though , it s been a few years since he took some time to write creatively .","289189":"honestly , no . lmaoo . it s always confused me because my type is essentially people who are outgoing , bold , determined , not afraid to speak their mind , etc etc . it doesn t have much to do with their appearance , from my experience .","289190":"well , that s your prerogative . i see things differently than you do , apparently . i have friends who are both college educated , only high school educated , and who have dropped out of high school . there isn t much of a difference between them all . even though i have a college degree , i have an hourly job , lol . it s hard to actually find a job that s salaried unless you have much more than entry level experience .","289191":"personality has always been more important to me . looks attractiveness is important to a certain degree , but you can t base a relationship off of looks alone . it won t last , because that matters most in a relationship is the chemistry between two people and how well they communicate .","289192":"i don t necessarily hate them because that s a very strong word , but i don t believe they know how much i distrust them or the detrimental way they ve influenced me and my mental health over the decades .","289193":"yes . i had a re occurring nightmare when i was a child during times of high stress , and thinking about it still freaks me out .","289194":"uh , my bio says non binary because , regardless of people such as yourself believe , that is my gender and it isn t something i m confused over . i ve known that i wasn t cisgender from the time i was a teenager . also , the fact that you re concerned over what sort of genitalia i have is quite concerning . i m a total stranger to you . it makes me wonder if every stranger you pass by is questioned of what they have in their pants , hmm . another fact your sexual orientation is not correlated with your gender . i m also bisexual , but that has nothing to do with my gender .","289195":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope you have a terrific day .","289196":"i m thankful for my boyfriend and close friends . they ve been beacons of support for me for many , many years and i wouldn t have survived without their encouragement , open mindedness , and lack of judgment towards my feelings or actions .","289197":"following your own dreams is so much more important than following the dreams your parents want for you . you are not an extension of your parents you are your own individual , and you should live your life according to what makes you happy and fulfilled .","289198":"certain songs and other forms of music make me incredibly nostalgic for past times . music is honestly one of the only things that can stir up nostalgia for me .","289199":"my favorite word has always been either sanguine or maelstrom . i don t really use either in my writing because it seems too unnecessary , but i ve always loved the associations with those words .","289200":"for the most part , yes . when someone is truly apologetic , you can tell in their apology , the way they behave , and how they change themselves after acknowledging they did something wrong .","289201":"no ? if anything , if i took part in black friday , it would be to purchase christmas gifts for my friends and family .","289202":"just took this for snapchat , haha .","289203":"tbh , i don t remember . probably at least three hours .","289204":"drinking coffee listening to music .","289205":"thank you ! !","289206":"i don t do anything on black friday , haha . i m just going to work .","289207":"i m off from work today because of thanksgiving , so i m going to do a few chores around the house this morning and then go to my parents house for dinner .","289208":"doesn t much matter to me personally . like i said , there are varying types of intelligence and also a person is not defined by their level of education .","289209":"askfm is for asking answering questions , not chatting .","289210":"i don t like whiskey , haha .","289211":"not generally , no . my handwriting is sorta a mixture of print and cursive .","289212":"it isn t in this world , but the shire would be lovely .","289213":"last year , my boyfriend i took a trip out east to the aquarium for a wine tasting night , and beforehand we went to a brewery and hung out at the hotel

occasional fast food cheeseburger .","289216":"bruh , i can t even think about having children at this stage of my life rn . i don t know what milestones are associated with children , when they should be going to the bathroom by themselves or dressing by themselves , when they should be making simple food for themselves , etc etc . i really have absolutely zero idea about parenting .","289217":"i honestly have no clue people say really dumb sh t to me on a regular basis to the point where it becomes commonplace and i brush it off like it s nothing these days .","289218":"sometimes , i do . i feel guilty about certain things , but i try not to let it eat at me .","289219":"i don t believe people necessarily choose their partners spouses , it s all a matter of what clicks between two people . and if an education level is something people value , then so be it . i don t personally put much credit in it because college isn t for everyone and there are varying types of intelligence .","289220":"i mean , hopefully people understanding mental illness more and contributing to erasing the stigma associated with lesser understood illnesses , like personality disorders and psychosis and schizophrenia , but one can always dream .","289221":"i don t generally answer questions regarding ben , but tbh if you think doe is bullying ben , then you evidently have no clue what ben has been doing to everyone on askfm over the past years . lmfaooo .","289222":"no , i couldn t care any less of what strangers on the internet think of me , tbh . and if people are mocking me , they should at least be brave enough to tag me in whatever they re saying , lmaoo .","289223":"sitting down and having conversations with my family .","289224":"i wouldn t necessarily say that i m special or out of the ordinary , because most of the people i follow have extremely active pages too . idk why my page is so active though , lmaoo . people just ask me questions on a regular basis . although right now , it s a hell of a lot more active than usual . i ve been trying to go through old questions in my inbox , but people are also sending me new stuff as well .","289225":"when i m in a gloomy mood , it normally means that i m struggling with a depressive phase . at that point , there really is nothing that can genuinely motivate me besides the constant fear of failure . in those frames of mind , i m rational enough to know when my hopelessness and lack of ambition will be detrimental to me , so i try to gather enough motivation to get by the skin of my teeth until the next morning .","289226":"tbh , you don t necessarily need to be original or innovative to attract a man s attention . you should always try your best to be true to yourself the right person will present themselves , and they ll be interested in you for who you truly are instead of being interested in a version of you that you re putting on for show to purposely attract someone s attention .","289227":"i honestly don t know whether or not i would be a good parent . i don t know if i even want children in the future . it isn t something that s a priority to me

responsible reliable person both at work and in my personal life .","289231":"uh , no ? when i say interpersonal relationships it doesn t necessarily have to mean my romantic relationship , lol .","289232":"the only class i fell asleep in was mass communications in my freshman year of college . the reason why i fell asleep was because i always stayed up late at night found it difficult to make it to class , considering it was at am . however , the subject i ve always disliked the most is math .","289233":"i would wish to have emotional stability , financial stability , and stability within my interpersonal relationships .","289234":"here , have some more selfies","289235":"eh , i have the tendency to be lazy however , most of the time i just suck it up do what needs to be done , otherwise it will give me major anxiety later on down the road .","289236":"i don t believe it s selfish you re simply at a different stage in your life than they are right now , and they re always going to do what s best for their child . if that s something you cannot handle at the moment , then you re both going to have to come to terms with that . not everyone is equipped to handle dating a parent if they re not at the same point in their life .","289237":"tbh , i don t have any plans yet besides possibly going out with a close friend on friday night . it s her birthday she s thinking about going to a local brewery , so i might meet her there and have a few drinks .","289238":"uh , they were s icide attempts . i m not going into more detail than that , though

cake . don t knock it til you try it .","289242":"depends on what the clothing is , tbh , and how much i like it . sometimes i ll wear them right away , while other times if they re just ordinary clothes , i ll wait until i feel like wearing them .","289243":"freshly baked rainbow cookies from the local bakery .","289244":"? ? ? i don t see what cadence has anything to do with this ? lmaoo . i literally only said that my askfm feed account is active .","289245":"my entire persona is an annoying quirk , lmaoo . tbh , it s probably the fact that i think i m annoying him my friends that they re always angry with me all the time . i ask them a lot if they re mad at me or if i did something wrong because i read too much into their texts or the way they phrase things .","289246":"no , quite the opposite actually . at least for my personally , my inbox is always active and i do have to actively tend to my questions every night in order to keep my inbox at bay . the people i follow are also relatively active as well .","289247":"he inhales sucks on his teeth especially when he s concentrating , like playing video games . it makes that gross suckling sound it irritates the hell outta me , lmaoo .","289248":"yes . when i was a pre teen , i wrote in a diary journal nearly every night . it was really one of the only ways i could release my innermost feelings , a catharsis in a way . however , i stopped writing in any sort of diary when my parents went into my room , took my diary , and read it without my knowledge or consent . i didn t trust them anymore and so i kept everything i did secretive .","289249":"no , i don t put much faith in astrology .","289250":"in high school , everyone was pretty assimilated with one another and hung out with each other , or at least the groups inter mingled somewhat . there were , of course , your typical preps and jocks , as well as the outcasts and nerds . but it s not as if they were all feuding against each other or anything .","289251":"i came to terms with my own mortality when i was a teenager . i ve never been particularly afraid of death , and in most cases , i welcome death with open arms . death itself has always been intriguing to me it s a frequent topic of my writings .","289252":"i can assure you that whatever you may perceive as cute is simply the byproduct of years of angle practicing , contrast brightness white balance monitoring , and filters .","289253":"i never chew gum . chewing gum allegedly makes teeth grinding worse , and because i grind my teeth at night while i sleep , i try to do everything i can to prevent it from happening or being worse than it already is .","289254":"no . i have a wallet . lmao .","289255":"yes , i have a good friend who s a hair stylist . i went to her salon last night to get it done .","289256":"when teachers are strict in terms of tardiness i . e . when students are only late on occasion , but the teacher makes a huge deal out of it , strict in terms of understanding that their students have lives of their own , strict in terms of understanding students hardships life struggles , etc etc . when a teacher is strict to the point where it prevents students from enjoying the prospect of learning , i think that s bad . it s also important for teachers to remember that students are human , they all have struggles and lives and hardship , and teachers should give more leniency if a student is behaving out of sorts , especially if it isn t typical of them .","289257":"i don t really have a style , so i suppose the automatic answer is yes , haha .","289258":"i don t believe i ve ever heard that song before .","289259":"yes , i am in support of stricter gun control .","289260":"when i was a college student , i attended classes full time and then i also worked part time which eventually led to full time work while i was in school . i commuted to campus instead of dormed .","289261":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","289262":"when i was in school , i preferred the teachers who were more casual but also knew when to be strict from time to time . teachers who are too strict only discourage students from learning .","289263":"i don t think there s a specific name for it or anything it s kinda like a chocolate brown leading into caramel brown with some blonde tones here there . it s balayage .","289264":"tbh , it s been at least years . i went into new york city and visited a few of the museums there just for fun .","289265":"usually yay sometimes nay . it all depends on the mood i m in .","289266":"yeah , my serotonin levels don t magically even out when i m with him , lol . i have a chemical deficiency , as well as a host of other variables that have contributed to my depression .","289267":"it s thanksgiving in the united states .","289268":"i just wash it with color safe shampoo conditioner .","289269":"i don t generally reach a state of happiness . i m content , at best .","289270":"no , i ve never visited a prison before .","289271":"pumpkin pie , tbh .","289272":"if you have external stressors in your life that are making you more prone to being short tempered , then yes that s quite common .","289273":"no , love alone cannot make a relationship last . there needs to be communication and a foundation of trust support in order to continue and strength a relationship . solely loving someone , unfortunately , is not enough .","289274":"i m doing well today much better than i have been in previous days earlier this week . i m happy that i have tomorrow off from work even though i have work on friday , so i m going to relax tonight with a few spiked seltzers while watching television .","289275":"i wasn t aware that expressing a preference for unnatural colored hair is considered acting out , lmaoo . i like my hair brown . i also like it purple , blue , pink , and red . i like highlights lowlights . i like bayalage and ombre . in general , i find it fun to experiment with hair color and style . it doesn t much matter to me what other people like . as long as i like it , that s all that matters .","289276":"? ? ? svspicion isn t a person who would hide

fail to see how this concerns me .","289281":"aw , thank you ! !","289282":"i like going dark in the winter .","289283":"ahh , thank you ! !","289284":"lol , no . my boyfriend actually has a fairly decent sense of style when it comes to clothing .","289285":"no , not really . movies aren t really very important or interesting to me besides a select few favorites .","289286":"hello do you have a question ?","289287":"yes , my day was rather good ! ! i had an extremely productive day at work , and then i went to my friend s salon and colored cut shaved my hair .","289288":"yes , that s fairly common for me in particular . if it s negatively affecting you during waking hours , then perhaps try adjusting your diet water intake , your sleep schedule , etc etc . you may also need to discuss this with your doctor and maybe run some bloodwork , you could be lacking in some nutrients or vitamins .","289289":"a majority of the music i listen to is purely instrumental whether it s classical piano , or some sort of television , movie or video game soundtrack .","289290":"on very rare occasions , yes . we ve argued a few times in the past , but it isn t something that happens often at all .","289291":"i used to get my eyebrows upper lip waxed routinely . now i just wax my upper lip myself tweeze my eyebrows .","289292":"cont . . . next appointment is in january and i don t want to wait so long to be honest . sleep is important to me and i haven t been able to sleep properly for a few days now . most medications don t reach their full potential effect until after weeks of taking the medication consistently . although you re having negative symptoms now , it should dissipate within those weeks once your body adjusts to having the medication . don t give up on it just yet wait and see what happens after that time period . if you re still experiencing these issues after that week period , then call your psychiatrist and explain what s going on . you can probably schedule a sooner appointment and try something else .","289293":"i smile when something makes me chuckle or brings me joy , but that s pretty much it .","289294":"idk , perhaps a salad or something . i don t normally order from mcdonalds although their coffee is pretty good .","289295":"yes when you go to post something on facebook , you can change the privacy settings of that particular post . it s usually automatically set to friends only or public , but if you tap on setting prior to posting , you can type in certain friends names and facebook will hide that post from those particular people .","289296":"yeah , i fell asleep during one or two of my college courses , haha .","289297":"it usually gets cold on long island new york state by mid october and doesn t warm up until march or april

friends and i obviously have no interest in them and never will .","289309":"someone ask me questions sh t because i m wide awake and cannot sleep worth a sh t .","289310":"nothing at the moment . i ve had the weekend to relax and recharge .","289311":"only time will tell , lol . i ve already developed back pain over the past four years alone , so who knows what will happen in the future .","289312":"if i had excruciating pain , then maybe . my body pain isn t that bad , though .","289313":"probably not . i don t have an interest in it .","289314":"it doesn t sway me one way or another .","289315":"idk ? i ve never made it before , lol .","289316":"yes , it s pretty good . i ve only had it on a few occasions , though .","289317":"yeah , but i rarely order from taco bell . when i do , i usually get a veggie power bowl .","289318":"no ? that seems pretty harmless to me .","289319":"my day was all right . i woke up feeling pretty terrible , continued working on freelance assignments , and then went to a doctor s appointment in the afternoon . my friend came over for a few hours and we chatted for a bit . i just heated up some dinner and i m going to shower when i m done .","289320":"occasionally , yes . i ve been binge watching the x files again , haha .","289321":"i ve tried yoga a few times , yes . i always felt good afterwards .","289322":"aw , wow thank you guys for , likes and , followers ! ! ask me more questions in the meantime","289323":"honestly , it s been quite a few years . i believe the last time i spent a few hours or a majority of the day without my phone was years ago when i took a vacation to montauk , new york . i left my phone in the motel room while my boyfriend and i traveled into town to visit various shops and the brewery .","289324":"my answer to this question is a bit similar to the previous question posed to me about intelligence there are many different forms of intelligence , and book smarts is only one type . even if i have a higher level of education than someone else , it doesn t necessarily mean that i m smarter than them .","289325":"quiet bookstores , the docks by the ocean or the bay , and coffee shops .","289326":"my bedroom would have been my first answer , but since i already answered one of your questions with my bedroom as an answer , i ll say that dwelling anywhere in nature is also a happy place of mine .","289327":"not necessarily , but it does make sentences incredibly difficult to read when they re all run on words with no breaks in between , lol . i know plenty of people who don t have a firm grasp on grammar , and there are many different forms of intelligence .","289328":"in most circumstances , it is rude to reject a gift especially if the person has all good intentions for getting you that gift . it s perfectly fine to be grateful in the moment and then perhaps talk to them later on about how you feel as if you don t deserve the gift or that you feel as if you owe them a favor , though . in most cases , they ll be understanding and reassure you that they gave you the gift out of their own free will and you don t owe them anything .","289329":"thanks , dude .","289330":"definitely not . it s been a breath of fresh air living on my own without the stress of being around my parents . i finally gained control of my own life , and the freedom is so liberating .","289331":"thank you by led zeppelin https www . youtube . com watch ? v u z vkpwklq","289332":"hello i ve been better mood wise , not gonna lie . this weekend has been hard for me for a variety of reasons , and i had a psychiatry appointment this afternoon so i was honest with my doctor and told her how i ve been feeling over the past month or so . she ended up increasing the dose of my medications and added a new pill to the mix . still not sure how i feel about it all , but i ll see what happens after i begin taking everything .","289333":"uh , it s a queen sized bed . lol .","289334":"uh . . . it just is ? lmaoo . i don t exactly know the science behind it .","289335":"my bedroom is one of the most peaceful places to me .","289336":"sometimes , if i feel like letting him know how i m feeling .","289337":"i don t lash out at people , no . i have a bad habit of internalizing everything and directing anger towards myself , which results in self destructive behavior .","289338":"in terms of sexism , then yeah men benefit from sexism because men are in a position of power over women . the system helps them , not hurts them like it has done to women over the course of centuries . however , being a human being is multifaceted and it s impossible to say whether someone has it harder than someone else , based on things such as sex , race , orientation , gender , religion , class , ability disability , etc etc . we re all composed of varying factors that both aid us and hurt us , so it s impossible to objectively say if it s easier or harder to be someone else .","289339":"not everyone who is female gets periods , so it wouldn t be an accurate statement . and not every person s period pains are the same some people aren t in pain at all , while other people are in excruciating pain .","289340":"coping with rampant sexism perpetrated by not only men but also the internalized misogyny put forth by people of the same sex .","289341":"i don t generally ask for advice , so it s hard for me to follow bad advice when i don t welcome advice from others in the first place .","289342":"no , it doesn t tempt me at all . i only purchase things when necessary or if i really want them , lol , so even if something is on sale , it doesn t necessarily mean that i need it at that moment . i spend more money in person , but that s attributed to things like bills , gas , food , coffee , etc etc .","289343":"ah , that s interesting . this is assuming , of course , that i actually drink alcohol . which i do , but it s not wise to assume that everyone is interested in drinking .","289344":"as my bio indicates , i am years old .","289345":"yes , i believe everyone is learning and growing from the day they re born until the day they die .","289346":"i m quite aware . thank you for raising awareness of this dilemma .","289347":"i don t remember , i purchased the television like two years ago .","289348":"it s a samsung smart tv . not sure what the model is or anything .","289349":"definitely not , lmaoo .","289350":"i don t really know most of them well enough to consider whether or not they re stupid , lol . we don t work together on most projects on the contrary , most people have their own projects that they work on , so our paths never coincide .","289351":"i don t like being around people most of the time . being around others drains my energy

understanding of punctuation is astonishing . regardless , i m not pregnant . i m just fat .","289354":"i have a habit of thinking too deeply about the things going on in my life and then succumbing

but thank you for asking regardless .","289360":". . . wait , are you literally asking me this for real ? lmaooo . oh my goodness please , find another method by which to practice medicine than by asking complete strangers on the internet to literally marry you . this is beyond redic .","289361":"i simply would feel uncomfortable agreeing to such a proposition . there are more productive ways to help others if they require help , such as redirecting them to resources and other methods of aid . i wouldn t want to compromise my own freedom and happiness .","289362":"no , i wouldn t be willing to do that for someone .","289363":"hello do you have a question ?","289364":"either baseball or football , i could imagine .","289365":"i don t really have much intention to return to art , tbh . i m a writer most of all , and writing is much more therapeutic to me than art ever was . thank you , though i really appreciate your words ! !","289366":"i didn t have the passion for it anymore , and i also didn t have the time anymore . after i graduated from high school and went to college , i focused all of my attention on creative writing . then things slowly started going downhill in my personal life , i eventually moved states , and i picked up a full time job outside of attending college classes . there simply was no time left .","289367":"no , i m not a person who

day and new years day , and i honestly have no idea what i ll be doing , lmaoo . i haven t had an entire week off from work in literally years .","289369":"when i was a teenager , i was very much more into art and painting than i am today . i appreciate good art these days , but back in the early s , i painted and drew prolifically and was very much involved in the art scene . i was also much more interested in music back in those times compared to today . although i still love music and listen to it every day , when i was a teenager i was addicted to linkin park s music and lived and breathed their music and influence in my every day life . i read up on their history and life stories , joined forums , made friends through their website , etc etc .","289370":"i believe that some people s personality traits coincide with the traits of their zodiac sign , but it isn t a universal thing . there will always be people who won t match up to what their zodiac sign says they should be , so i don t really place much value in astrology .","289371":"it depends on how the relationship with that ex ended , and how close i am to that ex today . if there s any doubt that it may be awkward for me to attend the wedding since my ex will be there , then i probably wouldn t go . however , if my ex and i are on good terms i . e . talking , then i see no reason why i shouldn t go to celebrate the occasion .","289372":"yes , i love cold pillows .","289373":"not really , no . i m not really looking forward to thanksgiving this year because it s going to be with my family , and they ve been insufferable since i moved out .","289374":"it s very difficult for me to trust people . i don t trust others right off the bat , and it takes a while for me to get to a point with a person where i can genuinely say that i trust them .","289375":"they re usually shows that i ve seen a hundred times before , lol . if i m doing something and need background noise and i don t feel like putting on music , then i ll put on a few episodes of the x files , how i met your mother , supernatural , ghost adventures , bones , etc etc .","289376":"if i m in a bad mood , there normally isn t much i can do to make myself feel better . i usually just ride it out until the next day . with respect to that , sleep sometimes gets rid of the bad mood to some degree .","289377":"i don t ever go shopping on black friday . i would rather not deal with the ridiculous crowds of people . i prefer waiting until cyber monday instead , that way i can shop from the comfort of my own home .","289378":"i never thought about it that way before , tbh . i ll have to do some more research on contemporary racism and how it manifests itself .","289379":"i m honestly not sure , lol . i haven t weighed myself in months .","289380":"yes , i wholeheartedly agree with you . racism is still very common and seen every day , unfortunately . however , it certainly isn t as commonplace as it used to be decades ago during the early to mid th century .","289381":"yes , i m currently in a relationship .","289382":"i was saying that if you guys want to poke fun at my weight , then at least be consistent with what you re all pointing out , haha . i just thought it was amusing that two different people thought two utterly different , conflicting things .","289383":"i never tried before . i wouldn t be able to make it from scratch , that s for certain .","289384":"yeah , i can make simple desserts like cupcakes , muffins , and cookies . lmaoo .","289385":"london , madrid , rome , moscow , and mykonos .","289386":"i haven t exercised in a while , but i used to walk on the treadmill at least times per week .","289387":"sometimes , but it depends on what was going on in my life at the time . in high school and parts of college , i did procrastinate a lot . however , towards the end of my college years , i learned time management and how to effectively complete my assignments with the little time i had without cramming them in towards the end .","289388":"uh , no ? lmaoo . you can see photos of me in my profile pictures on here , and i also post photos of myself occasionally when i feel like it .","289389":"i used to totally be a night owl stay up late every night , but these days i m more of a morning person . i get most of my chores work done in the morning so that i can relax by the time the afternoon comes .","289390":"no . honestly , my airbags should have gone off when i got into one of my first big accidents , but for some reason they didn t .","289391":"my wallet , car keys , house keys , phone , and vape .","289392":"people have told me that i look like heather matarazzo and or lady gaga .","289393":"the furthest i ve been from new york has been to austin , texas . i went there for a video game convention back in , and austin was a beautiful city ! ! i enjoyed the time i spent there a lot , everyone was super friendly and it was a very quirky , unique place

certainly never want to be in one .","289397":"askfm is for asking answering questions , not necessarily for conversation . if you have a question , feel free to ask it .","289398":"nothing out of the ordinary , tbh . i got home from work a little while ago , ate dinner , took my medication , and now i m relaxing with a beer while answering askfm questions . i had quite a few piled up in my inbox ,

scalding hot , relaxing shower tonight . i accomplished that goal now i feel a lot better rejuvenated , almost .","289417":"i ve been fine . i ve been going through a lot of stress lately , so yesterday i was barely on social media and went to sleep really early around pm , which is early for me . yesterday was also pretty busy i worked , went to therapy , visited my parents , and then ran an errand . i didn t get home until pm . i skipped dinner and ended up watching half an episode of television and falling asleep .","289418":"i don t have an opinion , it isn t something i particularly care about . if someone wants to be a sugar daddy mama baby , then they have the freedom to do so .","289419":"rarely ever , if at all .","289420":"yeah , i just don t know how much i m going to have to spend .","289421":"yes , they were married when i was conceived and born .","289422":"i m basically an open book ! ! however , my favorite topics are mental health , video games , writing , literature , television , animals , cosmetics , art , and photography .","289423":"no , i haven t even thought about shopping for christmas yet . i ve been so preoccupied with other things lately , and paying my bills and rent and such , that i haven t sat down yet to make a budget for the holidays .","289424":"i don t really know what you mean by the only one . if you re talking about previous generations , then i do believe that this upcoming generation is more cognizant of what s racist and what s not racist in society , and are also more apt to point out racism in every day life . in previous generations , racism was very commonplace .","289425":"i lent my roommate before he left to go to work tonight .","289426":"lately , i ve been nothing short of exhausted so my favorite hobbies these days have been watching television and sleeping . i ve also been writing here and there , mostly short non fictional flash pieces and poetry , but it only happens perhaps once per week or so .","289427":"i ve never worn a watch in my entire life , lmaoo . i dislike watches or pretty much anything on my wrists , with the exception of hair ties and whatnot .","289428":"yes , i believe that a lot of people have the capacity to change and grow apart from their oppressive problematic views . if they recognize that what they believe is wrong and actively work on bettering themselves to be more inclusive , then they can eventually get to a stage where they re not racist sexist etc etc . anymore . obviously it s quite difficult , especially if that person was raised in an environment where being racist , for example , was ingrained in them from a very young age . but i still believe it s possible . humans are entirely capable of growing and adapting themselves .","289429":"just because i didn t call it out when it happened doesn t mean i m not watering racism down or anything i literally wasn t even online , lmaoo . to expect everyone to be picture perfect is unrealistic . people are going to slip up every now and again , and as long as they re aware that it was wrong and will try better in the future , there isn t much else for them to do . i didn t brush ninegdxfour off and say that what she said was fine , obviously .","289430":"without a shadow of a doubt , yes . however , i m hesitant to accept anyone else to be in the same position based on the current people who are also in office .","289431":"everyone is problematic to some degree . as long as you re aware that it was a racist thing to say and you ll try to be more cognizant of it in the future , then there isn t much else you can do , lol . i agree , the only reason why people send this sh t out about other people is just to start drama .","289432":"probably this one . it looks feels the most like myself , whoever that may be .","289433":"i ve never liked the taste of celery .","289434":"i know that i should wash them before wearing them , but usually i don t . lmaoo .","289435":"well , it s pm so my day is basically over , lol . i just have to take a shower and then i ll go to bed afterwards . my day has been all right , though . my morning was pretty standard making coffee , getting breakfast , packing my lunch , etc etc . work was also fairly normal and expected , and then i went home and had pad thai for dinner . i just cracked open a beer and i m catching up on the questions in my inbox rn .","289436":"i woke up around am this morning , and i was absolutely exhausted . i wound up hitting snooze twice until am , and then i got ready to start my day .","289437":"i knew there were hearing about impeachment , but i haven t read up on the results of them or anything .","289438":"? ? ? i wasn t aware that ninegdxfour said anything racist . like i said , i haven t been on askfm since a few days ago .","289439":"i don t have an exact time , it ranges every night . i usually go to bed anywhere between pm and am .","289440":"no , i ve never wanted to do karaoke before . i ve been to a few karaoke bars before , but i always sat back and watched . my singing voice is terrible and embarrassing .","289441":"i love halloween time the holiday itself , as well as the general atmosphere of chilly weather and crisp air . i love when it s colder outside .","289442":"i was not aware that there was drama on askfm . i wasn t answering questions yesterday .","289443":"i would rather be composted and have my remains buried beneath a tree or compressed into a seed that will eventually grow into a tree .","289444":"definitely not , lol . however , i did have a few extreme couponers who visited my store when i worked in retail .","289445":"no , i don t believe in karma . i don t believe that good people always have good things coming to them and bad people get what they deserve , because normally the opposite happens . good people tend to suffer greatly while bad people get away with whatever wrongdoing they did .","289446":"hello please don t call me dear , i don t appreciate nicknames like that . however , i m fine . i m just relaxing after a stressful two days with a beer and calming music , and i m catching up on answering questions in my inbox .","289447":"no . having s x is only fleeting feelings of euphoria derived from endorphins , which dissipates after a brief period of time . genuine happiness is much deeper and more complex .","289448":"yes , i try to use coupons whenever possible and buy things that are on sale .","289449":"no , i ve never had physical therapy before . the only therapy i ve ever gone to was psychotherapy .","289450":"i turned years old in .","289451":"yes , i eat caesar salads on occasion . i also enjoy spinach salads with mushrooms .","289452":"aw , thank you","289453":"no . i struggle with major depressive disorder .","289454":"passionate , impulsive and unstable .","289455":"no , i absolutely hate math . i was great at algebra and calculus while i was in school , but i didn t like it at all .","289456":"i treated myself to a peppermint mocha latte the other morning while going to work .","289457":"you evidently didn t read my answer . . . . and the maturity level and general personality of my future child . obviously it would depend on how that child behaves on a regular basis .","289458":"washing my boyfriend s truck was the biggest thing i ve ever washed , lmaoo . i couldn t even reach the roof of the car , so he ended up doing that while i worked on the parts lower to the ground .","289459":"definitely not as often as i should , lol . during the summer , i ll wash my car maybe once every two months . i ve taken my car to the car wash once or twice during the winter to get the salt stains off of the body , too .","289460":"no , i don t like watches and i don t really like the feeling of things on my wrist , like watches or bracelets . the only thing i ever have on my wrist is a hair band .","289461":"i don t clean my jewelry . the only time my jewelry gets clean is when i shower with a necklace on , haha .","289462":"i ll wipe it down with a lysol wipe on occasion , especially when i begin thinking too deeply of how much bacteria is probably on my phone . lmaoo .","289463":"i don t really have much of a fashion style if anything , it s casual . during the autumn and winter months , i just wear tank tops , cardigans , skinny jeans , and boots . i also have a lot of hoodies , lol .","289464":"cont . . . i get my eyebrows or nails done . i don t know , like there is this part of me that is protecting myself . could be fear or intuition , or both . i m constantly getting so anxious and these thoughts are making me feel so restless . i want to be vulnerable with them and share stuff but this person in my head holds me back . i always relied on my intuition and they are almost always right and something just tells me i can t fully trust them . i want to be able to be vulnerable or share stuff but i . . . can t . i can t be like that . and i really don t like that about myself , but my childhood probably contributes to this . and it doesn t help that my mother just told me to not trust them so much because we always need to keep a part of ourselves secret so people won t take advantage of us . my mother s intuition is always right about people and i know i shouldn t be doubting my best friend . but i don t know . i m so lost so confused , don t know who to trust . i only feel this way about them but not about my other friend . so this makes me even more suspicious of them and time believing this is my intuition . this honestly makes me want to cut them off like right now but i m so so confused . i just keep thinking they are putting on a really good act and acting like they are my best friend but deep down they are laughing , always wanting information out of my mouth so they can use it against me . my doctor says this is related to bpd . please help . not sure if you can relate . tbh , i can sorta relate but this happens between me and most people i consider friends , not just one person in particular . i m a very paranoid sort of person so i m constantly questioning other people s motives and whether or not they re actually my friend or they just feel bad for me and put up with me because they re afraid of what i would do otherwise . it s so isolating , and as a result , i cut people off without warning . what has your doctor therapist whoever said that may help with these emotions you re feeling ? because i m basically in the same boat , i don t really know how to actively help however , i do completely understand where you re coming from .","289465":"i m very selective about who i follow . i believe i only follow maybe people right now . i tend to follow people who have interesting answers and get asked unique questions . i don t really like when people have one worded answers , so i usually avoid accounts like that . most of the people i follow are very intelligent and or have amusing and witty responses .","289466":"i have a love of and fascination with conspiracy theories , urban legends , and ghost stories . most of the things i watch on television have to do with those as well as true crime .","289467":"there are some people who exist in this world who are incapable of feeling strong emotion for one reason or another , and tbh it s usually indicative of an underlying mental or developmental illness . the trait of not understanding , feeling , or showing emotion is called alexithymia .","289468":"my boyfriend has had the most positive influence on me . he s honestly been my rock and most solid system of support over the years , and he has also inspired me to be the best version of myself . he motivates me to do better in my own life .","289469":"it depends on the subject matter of the movie game and the maturity level and general personality of my future child . if i believe that it s something they can handle maturely , then i would allow them to take part in the movie game and probably under my supervision as well .","289470":"probably one of the pieces of jewelry my boyfriend bought me a few years ago for my birthday , or christmas , or valentine s day i honestly don t remember which holiday . they always have sentimental meanings behind them .","289471":"yes , i ve had a few experiences . the most prominent experience was when i was a teenager and i played with a ouija board with one of my old friends . we both ended up seeing some weird , white shadow y figure dart from one room at the end of the hallway to another room .","289472":"i believe exercising is very important , but unfortunately i don t take part in it as often as i probably should .","289473":"i have been alive for , days .","289474":"sometimes , yes ! ! especially if i m looking forward to doing something with him , like if we re going on a vacation together , or when he does particularly heartfelt things for me .","289475":"tbh , i haven t played video games in a few weeks . the last game i played was skyrim , though . it s one of those immortal games that leaves me wanting more every time i play , even though i ve already been playing it for six years .","289476":"thank you ! ! it was actually yesterday but i m just getting to most of these messages now , haha .","289477":"i m interested in my boyfriend .","289478":"i wouldn t exactly call that spoiling me , lol .","289479":"aw , thank you ! !","289480":"thank you so much","289481":"thank you ! !","289482":"? ? ? you don t need to have sex with a person to find them sexually attractive , lol .","289483":"i m not drinking hard at all , haha . i have work tomorrow morning .","289484":"haha , thank you . i m not exactly partying hard rn , i m just drinking amaretto and writing .","289485":"thank you ! !","289486":"thank you ! ! i appreciate it","289487":"i only saw my boyfriend thus far , and he gave me a harry potter water thermos , a beautiful candle , and a bottle of disaronno .","289488":"thank you ! !","289489":"i don t have confidence , lol . i just simply don t care and i don t have the energy to wake up in the morning to do makeup before going to work , where i hardly interact with humans and stare at a computer screen for eight hours straight .","289490":"i wear my glasses to work , but i seldom ever wear makeup .","289491":"no , i don t believe in destiny or karma . i believe life is a series of coincidences and lucky breaks .","289492":"i honestly don t know . every year has its ups and downs .","289493":"it s a trait , yeah it s a method of manipulation in order to convince you to stay with him . based on that alone , he sounds like a sh tty person and you do deserve better than to be guilt tripped into remaining with a person because they don t think you can do anything better than him .","289494":"i haven t worn contacts since high school , but yes that used to happen to me too when i wore contacts . i eventually switched to just wearing glasses because of similar things happening , especially in terms of staring at a computer screen all day .","289495":"points of authority remix by linkin park off of the reanimation album . https www . youtube . com watch ? v kx cvdfda","289496":"well , happy early birthday ! ! that makes two of us , haha . i just turned years old today .","289497":"yes , there is a lot that i wish i did that i ended up not doing or not realizing i could have done something but after it was already too late .","289498":"i received two happy birthday messages one seven minutes ago , and one four minutes ago . i didn t respond to either of them yet .","289499":"lol . that s wonderful that apparently no one believes in non binary genders , but regardless , that doesn t change my gender .","289500":". . . wut . lmaoo . i changed my name from spoopleigh to leigh because it isn t halloween season anymore .","289501":"we would likely go into new york city and visit the museum of natural history , the museum of modern art , the metropolitan museum of art , and the museum of s x .","289502":"i would rather have the perfect face , tbh . having a perfect body is nice and all , but i would rather be more content with my face as opposed to having an ideal body . at the moment , i find my face more attractive than my actual body .","289503":"considering i m overweight haven t worked out in a few months , i would consider myself more brainy than brawny .","289504":"probably not , tbh . my friends are all sarcastic b stards and would probably choose something horrible , lol .","289505":"laying down in bed , listening to music , and having a glass of wine before drifting off to sleep .","289506":"dude , i literally just logged on five minutes ago . lol . i ll change my bio eventually .","289507":"hello today is my birthday , and it s been a pretty decent day ! ! i m in a relaxed , tranquil mood rn and i m fairly content . i m drinking some disaronno and i have a candle lit , and i m about to put on some music .","289508":"aw , thank you ! ! i m feeling pretty good rn . i m exhausted from a long day at work , but my boyfriend came over for a few hours and gave me some gifts which were really sweet , and now i m just relaxing in bed .","289509":"i don t really order from either place , but mcdonalds coffee is pretty good .","289510":"no , i m not curious . i m bisexual , lol .","289511":"like hot cups of coffee early in the morning . positive reinforcement . cuddles with my boyfriend . relaxing with a glass of wine at the end of the night . listening to calming music . dislikes traffic while driving to and from work . micro management from coworkers bosses . encouragement for any sort of oppression , i . e . homophobia , transphobia , racism , sexism , etc etc . burning food on the stove . being late to work .","289512":"? ? ? are you asking how many likes i have ?","289513":"i don t know what either of those mean .","289514":"i seldom get sick . the seasons are changing , so it also isn t unusual for me to get a little sick around this time of year .","289515":"i think i m getting sick . i have sinus congestion , my stomach is killing me , and my lymph nodes are swollen , ugh . i ve been drinking ginger tea all afternoon to quell this gross feeling . y all should send me questions","289516":"that s really unhealthy for him to be saying that to you , tbh . ideally , he should understand your concerns and try to make you more comfortable and secure in the relationship regardless of how rational or irrational your fears are . you re certainly not crazy .","289517":"no . i have no interest in buying high end name brand clothing . i would much rather spend that money paying off my debts , getting tattoos , going to various concerts and other events , traveling , etc etc .","289518":"no , i don t love her romantically . we dated years ago .","289519":"not yet , no . i m turning years old tomorrow .","289520":"apparently so , lol . there is such a thing as drinking responsibly , and there are myriad people who are in their s , s , s , and s who drink responsibly .","289521":"i don t know if she was my first love because we were young , but regardless , the first person i developed strong feelings for was my best friend .","289522":"it isn t normal , no however , it is very common . if you re thinking this , then you should bring these feelings up to your boyfriend so you two can discuss them .","289523":"? ? ? it s unfortunate that alcohol is normalized in society , and i m quite aware of that , but it isn t out of the ordinary for people my age to go out and drink . most of the demographic at the places i go to are people my age older . also god forbid i go out and have a few drinks to celebrate my birthday , lmaoo .","289524":"i haven t been to burger king in so long , lol . but the last time i went there , i ordered a spicy crispy chicken sandwich without mayonnaise ."}}
