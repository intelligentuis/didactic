(Picture above) then i started eating kelp or sea moss everyday and my body weight leveled out again to its natural weight, which is below 100 pounds. So really honestly, its not my standards but im just going by how my body feels. & if i literally feel like im carrying a water balloon everywhere i go, i gained way to much weight.\n  \n  Ive also never eat more than my body needs. I have this switch in my brain that goes, \u201cthats enough, youre a lazy fuck\u201d ?\n  \n  Also, been studying how over eating and our new modern lifestyle is actually damaging to us on a chromosome level which is what causes increased speed in aging and weight gain.\n  ","606980":"\n  Awh, thats so sweet.\n  \n  You dont have to speak english normally to do that, but i get what you\u2019re saying ?\n  ","606981":"\n  With this logic, you shouldnt be concerned with my standards i hold for myself.

He put a gun to someones head because of me but he would tell you the one thing i always did was be honest about how i feel. Didn\u2019t change shit for him, he\u2019s still in love with me.
