   what do you think about parents who post on social media about their children’s bad behavior with the intent to humiliate them but excuse it as “tough love” by teaching them a lesson? what do you think about people saying parents of this magnitude has a god like complex?
  ","
  i'm not a parent at all, but i think it's wrong for parents to willingly humiliate their children as a means of discipline. it's extremely childish and demeaning, in my eyes. the child won't grow up to respect you as both a parent and a human being. in order to properly discipline a child, there has to be communication -- not humiliation.
  
  i don't really know if it's akin to having a god like complex, but it's definitely an ignorant way to parent a child.

   just last week, a woman was fatally shot and killed from a stray bullet during a struggle between a drug dealer in a security guard on bourbon street.

what precautions do you think the city could take to prevent future fatalities such as this from occurring?
  ","
  getting down to the root of the problem, which is drug trafficking -- police need to crack down on the drugs being distributed in the streets, as well as provide more health care options for addicts who feel like they need help but don't know where to look, or don't have the resources to get treatment. supply and demand is a large component of drug trades, and if there's less demand for the drugs on the street, then dealers will have a hard time maintaining their clientele.

   victoria’s secret recently has spoken about shutting down 50+ of its stores and a lot of feedback is saying they’re losing money cuz their usual demographic focuses more on thinner women. 

thoughts?
  ","
  i don't know much about the event besides seeing headlines for it on facebook. but victoria's secret is notorious for discriminating again people who aren't conventionally attractive, who aren't thin, and who aren't cisgender (and i think something happened with them regarding POC but i don't remember).
  
  it makes sense why they aren't making any money these days. i still buy from the company because i still fit into their clothing, strangely enough, but a lot of people are disgusted by what they represent and don't want to endorse a company like that.

413031,"
   Should people who are part of the LGBT+ community be allowed to adopt children? Why or why not?
  ","
  yes, they absolutely should. someone's sexual orientation or gender doesn't determine their parenting skill, and children deserve to have loving homes regardless of what their parents are.
  
  there are so many inadequate heterosexual homes that foster or adopt children, it doesn't make sense that people who are gay or trans can't adopt as long as they have an adequate home and can provide for the child.

   recently it was talked about on one of our local radio stations that schools were thinking about providing rooms specifically for students to privately vape. but it was also never stated if they meant high-schools or colleges. 

what is your opinion on this?
  ","
  ... are you kidding me ??
  
  i think that's ridiculous. smoking a vape is essentially the same thing as smoking a cigarette, and people shouldn't be accommodated that deeply for their vice when they can clearly just go outside for five minutes. smokers aren't given an extra room to smoke in, so why should vapers be treated any differently ??

   Do you think that inequality in America is deliberately perpetuated by those in power or is it simply an unintended consequence of the system?
  ","
  i believe it's both. some people in power profit off of the marginalization of others, while other forms of inequality is an inevitable consequence of the way the government works.
  "
413046,"
   Do you see America as being an egalitarian society?
  ","
  LOL, definitely not. there's too much inequality in the united states for it to be such a society.
  "
413047,"
   I understand that but doesn't power always remain with the individual because they get to decide their own happiness.  Like, as long as you have shelter, food and clothing, you can still be happy?
  ","
  realistically, yeah. but there are a lot of people who equate happiness with wealth in a superficial way. however, at the same time, wealth *can* be equated to happiness because a lot of people may be more at ease if they didn't have financial struggles to deal with on a regular basis.
  "
413048,"
   How does power relate to wealth?
  ","
  the more money you have = the more power you have, in a general sense. or vice versa. people with a lot of power, especially in the corporate and political worlds, have massive amounts of wealth.
  "
413049,"
   Why do some people want to keep accumulating wealth when they already have more than enough to make ends meet?
  ","
  because they're greedy & ruled by money. a lot of people only see dollar signs instead of focusing their attention on the relationships they create in life, and the power associated with wealth rules them.

   Do you see animal inter communication as being a type of language even though we can't understand it?
  ","
  yeah, animals of all species have their own brand of language much like humans express different languages depending on which part of the world they occupy.
  "
413052,"
   Do you see language as being a technology?
  ","
  to an extent, yes. language is a tool used by people of all cultures, and even in animals, to express ideas and further our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. it's also constantly improving and evolving.
  
  not to mention the fact that programming language is a technology in itself.
  "
413053,"
   How far back have you researched where language actually started?
  ","
  i don't remember. i graduated from college six years ago.
  "
413054,"
   What sort of things did you learn from your bachelors degree compared to someone who hasn't done such a degree?
  ","
  my bachelor's degree was in communications and professional writing, so i learned grammar & rhetoric in a very intense manner that isn't touched upon in high school, how to communicate effectively within a group via oral communication classes, how to design and format various media with adobe programs, and other things having to do with business communications.
  
  i also minored in english literature, so i studied a lot of classic literature and developed a greater understanding of where language comes from and how it's evolved over the years in terms of literary techniques and styles. i also majored in creative writing for one year, so i was taught how to formally structure a paragraph depending on your audience and the 'do's and don'ts' of writing fiction and non-fiction.

   What economic investments do you see as being valuable?
  ","
  certain stocks, i would assume. i know absolutely nothing about economics, though.

   Would you say that you have a high level of education?
  ","
  not really, no. i only have a bachelor's degree.
  "
413057,"
   How do you define Love?
  ","
  love is a feeling of unconditional infatuation with a person, where you tend to care about their well being more than you care about your own at times, and you consistently want what's best for them before your own needs. their existence in your life is meaningful to you & you feel the most like yourself around them, the best version of yourself that you can be.
  "
413058,"
   Do you think that it's ever possible to have a totally unbiased opinion?
  ","
  not really, no. our opinions are undoubtedly influenced by those around us, whether it's from our friends and family or the media in general. even if our opinion is truly our own, it was influenced in some way through a particular source which led us to come to that conclusion to begin with.
  "
413059,"
   Do you think that the richest people in society should be taxed at a higher rate than ordinary people?
  ","
  i'm not really sure what my opinion is on this question. even if people of lower financial statuses are taxed at the same percentage as those of higher financial statuses, more money is being taxed from the wealthy because the amount taken out of their wealth will be larger due to the percentage amount.
  
  however, at the same time, i also believe that it's important to distinguish the discrepancies between people of higher and lower classes when it comes to taxes, because often those of lower classes cannot afford to get as much tax taken out as they currently do, which further leads to the disconnection between the 99% and the 1%.
  "
413060,"
   Do you think it's becoming more difficult to know what news is fake and what news is real?
  ","
  no, i don't believe it's becoming more difficult. as long as you're fact-checking your sources and reading articles from multiple news publications, then you can get a general idea of current events from a mostly unbiased perspective.
  "
413061,"
   You're on a first date with someone and they keep mentioning their ex, is this a positive or a negative for you? Do you think it's great that they're so open & learned so much from their last relationship or do you think that they seem to not be over their ex & they're thinking about them a lot r/n?
  ","
  i think it all depends on in what context they're mentioning their ex. if they're complaining about the things they used to do or keep comparing their current date to their ex, then it may be an indication that they're still thinking about them or may not be completely over them. however, if they *do* mention that they learned certain things from their previous relationship, it may be seen as a good thing because that's an indication that they have moved on and are willing to open the next chapter of their life.
  "
413062,"
   Is a 17 year old girl responsible for falling prey to the advances of a 27 year old man and getting pregnant?
  ","
  no, not in my opinion. a 17 year old girl is still a minor, and it isn't her fault that she was groomed and taken advantage of by someone 10 years older than her. the adult in this situation should know better than to pursue someone who's a minor, and they're the one at fault for their predatory behavior.
  "
413063,"
   if you threaten to beat someone, is it still considered aggression?
  ","
  yeah, that's aggressive behavior regardless of whether it's verbal or physical.
  "
413064,"
   What to do when your family wont let you move out and interfere with any chance at independence?
  ","
  if you're an adult, you're under no obligation to listen to your family in terms of you moving out and leading an independent lifestyle. they're going to have to accept the fact that you're your own person, and you need to live your life according to your own terms.
  
  i know it may be difficult to stand up to your family, but you owe it to yourself to move on with your life and start a new chapter.
  "
413065,"
   Does world history fascinate you?
  ","
  somewhat, yeah. i'm not as interested in world history as i used to be when i was in high school (i took an AP european history course), but it's still something that interests me from time to time. especially the world war II era and other events like the french revolution or the renaissance period.
  "
413066,"
   Can teenagers do botox if they have wrinkles on their forehead?

  "
413067,"
   When was the last time you were sabotaged and what happened? (This can be self sabotage or someone else sabotaging you)
  ","
  i self-sabotage more than i'm sabotaged by other people, and it mainly has to do with the use of substances, i.e. drugs & alcohol. i don't have much self control, and often it puts me in difficult positions.
  
  the last time i suppose i self-sabotaged was a few days ago when i went out to celebrate my promotion. i got really drunk and i don't remember half of the night, which has always been so embarrassing for me. and even though i keep telling myself that i should ease up, i always give in.
  "
413068,"
   if you were a videoblogger, what would your videos be about?

  "
413069,"
   Would you rather be the funniest person in the room ? Or the most intelligent?
  ","
  i would rather be the most intelligent person in the room, but only really if that meant that you weren't intelligent if you were the funniest person. i value intelligence and education highly, and while it's wonderful to have a sense of humor, you can only go so far with humor in terms of interpersonal relationships.
  "
413070,"

   Who in your eyes are the perfect fictional couple and why do you think so?
  ","
  even though you mentioned gomez & morticia addams already, i'm going to have to repeat that because they're my all-time *favorite* fictional couple !!
  
  their love is so surreal, intimate, and real. i've always admired the connection they had, as well as the darkness associated with them, because it very much reminds me of my relationship with my boyfriend (lol).

413073,"
   Do you think it's fair that a small minority of the population can own 90% of all the wealth?

  i'm doing well -- i just got home from work, which was very productive because i managed to finished all of the tasks i laid out for myself last night & then worked on completing more of a spreadsheet for the program i'm administrating.
  
  after work, i stopped by dunkin and picked up an iced coffee (even though it's freezing outside, lol), and now i'm just sitting down and relaxing at home. i may go back out and run some errands tonight in light of whatever snowstorm is supposed to happen this weekend, but it isn't a priority.

   does it matter to you that your significant other eating habits are like yours?
what if one person ate healthy most of the time and the other ate junk a lot?
  ","
  someone else's eating habits don't matter much to me, as long as they're not completely unhealthy to the point where it's damaging to their body. i want what's best for them and their health, so if i see that they're eating junk food and other unhealthy items *all* the time, then i would perhaps raise the concern of what it's doing to their body.
  "
413077,"
   Do you think America is a plutocracy?

  ","
  you would have to google this, i don't personally know the answer to this. i could imagine it being incredibly difficult to get permission to publish fanfiction, though. that's basically their brand on the line and there will inevitably be people who will read the book and think it's canon when it actually isn't.

   she said she was ""gay"" for a 17 yr old, gay implies sexual or physical attraction. if a 25 yr old man said he has the ""hots"" for a 17 yr old he would be lynched.
  ","
  no, being ""gay"" for someone is generally used as a term to mean idolizing or just being obsessed with them in general. it doesn't have an automatic sexual undertone to it unless you make it that way.
  
  having the ""hots"" for someone, on the other hand, *is* a sexualized term. lol i can't believe i have to explain this lingo, usually it's the other way around for me.

   To those of you who have used CBD in the past, regardless of the form it came in, what did you use it for? Did it work and how did it affect you?
  ","
  i've never used straight CBD before, but i've heard it works wonders with anxiety. i've been thinking about researching some products online that i can ingest orally or even use as an oil since my anxiety has been acting up lately.
  
  i also know someone who has some sort of respiratory problems, i don't remember the name of the disorder he has. but he needs one of those breathing machines because it was getting so bad. however, he used a CBD ointment and applied it every night and it helped him to breathe a lot better.

   Have you ever participated in a medical trial (of any kind) ? If not, would you consider it?

  i've never participated in a medical trial before, but i have considered it in the past. a local university put an advertisement on the radio regarding a clinical trial they were conducting with a new medication for depression, and thought about giving them a call, but i thought about it and didn't really want to screw up the medication regimen i already have because idk if that experimental medication would even work for me to begin with.

   I know someone who said he can't have a daughter because he's not sensitive enough thoughts on that?
  ","
  i don't really have any thoughts on the matter because i don't know the person you're talking about. however, being a parent requires a certain degree of instinct where you feel a natural inclination toward caring for a child, and if someone doesn't feel that instinct or express empathy toward others, then they may not be suitable for parenthood.
  
  at the same time, however, parenthood *does* change people into more expressive, sensitive individuals sometimes. they develop a natural bond with their baby and it becomes natural from there. so it goes on an entirely individualized basis.

  at the same time, i like being spontaneous because i can easily text a friend and ask what they're doing in a few hours and go from there. at that point, i know that i want to do something, but at the same time, i also become disappointed if no one is available, lol.

   do you think all these streaming services is taking away from the authenticity of dvd’s? does it really make a difference to you or do you prefer to be able to be included in the most updated technology?
  ","
  i don't really care so much to be up to date with new technology, but i do prefer streaming services like netflix & hulu over owning dvds. blu-rays go for $20-30 each, but you can pay $12-15 per month for a subscription service and watch whatever they offer as many times as you want.
  
  there are some movies that i want to see that aren't offered in subscription services, but i can always rent them on demand for like $5 instead of going out and buying the dvd without knowing if i'll like the movie or not.

  uh, don't put off the advanced oral communications class (if you have to take one) as much as i did -- i was so afraid to take that class that i ended up putting it off until my final semester, even though i needed the class to graduate, lmao. it's better to take it early and get it out of the way, especially on top of the stress of every other advanced class you have to take as a senior.
  
  also, try finding an internship !! communications is a great field because it's versatile so you can find anything from social media marketing to business management to writing & publishing, etc etc. my advisor helped find me one, so you can probably inquire within your department. internships are wonderful for your resume.

   What's your opinion on body positivity? Do you think it's for everyone or just people who are considered conventionally unattractive? Do you strive to be body positive?
  ","
  i think body positivity is for everyone, because everyone has their own struggles regarding their bodies and their own self image in general, regardless of how conventionally attractive they are.
  
  however, i do believe there's a distinct difference between promoting body positivity and the whole ""fat acceptance"" movement. obviously it's good to be positive about your body, but if you're obese, then that's a health concern that needs to be addressed, whether it's through eating healthier food, exercising, taking supplements, etc etc. some people are disillusioned when it comes to obesity because of the body positivity movement, but good health is something we all should strive towards.

  it depends on how you actually felt when you were drinking, lol. you can throw up after one drink, it doesn't necessarily mean you were drunk. it just means the alcohol didn't mix well in your body. i've vomited after having two drinks before even though i wasn't drunk at all, it just didn't sit well in my stomach at the time.

   What is your opinion of love? Is it permissible for them to do what they want, or are there red lines that they shouldnt skip?
  ","
  with any sort of relationship, platonic or romantic, there should be loyalty and respect between everyone involved. that includes lines that people shouldn't cross, which varies from person to person. a person is free to do what they want within a certain boundary, i.e. if a couple is monogamous then it's crossing a line if someone is sleeping with somebody else.
  
  however, it's permissable to a point -- if one partner is preventing their significant other from doing things like dressing how they want or going out with their friends, then that's controlling and manipulative behavior.

  YES. this happens to me a lot with random memes on facebook or twitter that are like, ""you were alive in the 90s if you remember this show,"" and it's a screenshot of a really old children's show. it brings back vague memories because it feels so familiar, and it's so bizarre.

  also, it happened a lot with people trying to scam the system or steal things. i confronted a person trying to steal a whole cart of items, so when they left the cart in the aisle and walked out the door, i quickly grabbed it and placed it behind the registers. when the next group of people came in looking for the cart, they were confounded because it was gone. lmao.

  as for the children portion of the question, i believe it isn't irresponsible -- as long as she's taking proper care of her children and giving them the lives they deserve. at that point, it doesn't matter who the fathers are, what matters truly is whether or not she's being a proper mother and taking care of her children accordingly.

  no, i don't believe that's a good idea. scare tactics such as those often aren't effective, and subjecting teenagers to that sort of experience may make their impulses worse instead of better.

   Is it worthy to be in love to a person you loved, even if you are too distant apart?
  ","
  it depends entirely on the situation, i believe. sometimes it's worthwhile to love a person although there's distance between you, while other times the cons outweigh the pros & you're better off finding a partner who is closer to you. everyone has a different way of loving someone else, and often distance is a determining factor.

  no, my physical pain isn't for no particular reason -- i mostly experience back pain, which is due solely to the fact that i work in an office & i'm sitting down for eight hours per day.
  
  as for mental pain, there has always been a reason behind that. if i'm hurting emotionally, it's usually because someone hurt my feelings and i never got closure from it. the only mental thing that happens spontaneously is my anxiety. there's usually no rhyme or reason to my anxiety attacks.

  i'm a strong debater on online platforms, but not so much in person. i stumble over my words and it's difficult for me to express myself verbally. however, in writing, i can put up strong arguments and counterpoints, and i also like to do research prior to stating an opinion on something.
  
  i do separate my emotions from my debates, though. debates, ideally, should be logically-based, as well as based on scientific evidence and factual support. there's no room for emotions in those contexts.

  i honestly believe it should be around 12-13 years old, because at that age, you fully know what you're doing and the ramifications of your actions. however, i also believe it does go on a case-by-case basis and it depends entirely on the situation itself and how severe the ab*se is.

  yeah, a few months ago i reached out to an old friend -- someone i used to talk to online for many years, but we stopped contact because we eventually just drifted apart when i went to college.
  
  now we talk every few weeks or so, just to catch up and tell each other what's going on in our lives. she also likes reading my essays and poetry, so i'll send them to her whenever i've written something new to get her input.

  it's a good quality to be persistent in a general sense, but it's *not* a good quality if you're trying to pursue a person and you simply won't take ""no"" for an answer. that's not persistence at that point, that's just being entitled and privileged.
  
  if someone says ""no"" when you ask them out, then leave them alone. they clearly don't want to go out with you, and if you're consistently vying for their attention, it gets irritating and overwhelming. some people simply cannot handle rejection.

   Do you think it's never to late everyone can change
  ","
  i believe that most people have the capacity to change. however, not everyone does, and some people are in far too deep in their own toxic ways that they'll never realize their own behavior, even if it's pointed out to them time and time again.
  
  sometimes it *is* too late, and that's the way life goes. not everyone is willing to wait for someone to change, and tbh, most people don't deserve to be forced to wait on someone like that.

  yeah, absolutely. as long as both partners are open to communication and willing to compromise on things like any other relationship, then there shouldn't really be an issue.
  "
413466,"
   Controversial relationship topics: When a couple move in together and one already has a pet, should the partner moving in take on the responsibility of caring for that pet?
  ","
  i don't believe that the person moving in should be directly and solely responsible, considering the pet is owned by the other person. however, it isn't unreasonable for them to take care of that pet in their partner's absence, because they're living in that space just as much as their partner is now. it should be a joint effort.
  "
413467,"
   Controversial relationship topics: Do you think it's possible to have opposing political beliefs and yet have a healthy relationship with one another?
  ","
  it's definitely possible, yes. some people simply don't place much importance on political beliefs because it doesn't directly affect their relationship, especially if those beliefs aren't typically seen as radical or extreme.
  
  a lot of people obviously can't be in a relationship with someone if their beliefs strictly oppose their own, especially if a person is pro-life or something, but it ultimately depends on the couple's dynamics and what they can compromise on.
  "
413468,"
   Controversial relationship topics: Are sex and intimacy the same thing?
  ","
  no, sex and intimacy are not the same things. intimacy is a feeling of being deeply connected to a person, which doesn't necessarily have to involve physical affection. sex can be a physical display of that intimacy, however, if those people are both consenting to that type of expression of intimacy.
  "
413469,"
   Controversial relationship topics: Is using a partner's toothbrush disgusting or sweet?

  no, that's hella gross, in my opinion. even though you share bodily fluids with the person you're dating anyway, you're basically picking up their dental bacteria by using their toothbrush and rubbing it all over your mouth and gums. it isn't sanitary.
  "
413470,"
   Is asking someone's parents for permission to propose to their child more respectful or disrespectful in your opinion?
  ","
  it's traditional for a lot of families to value the partner asking the parents' permission to marry their child, so in that vein, it can be seen as more respectful -- especially if both partners are family oriented and believe in those sorts of traditions.
  
  however, if someone wasn't close to their family or didn't believe in such a tradition, but their partner asked their parents' permission and were turned down, then i think it would be disrespectful to the child if the partner decided not to marry them based solely on their parents' wishes. if that makes sense, haha.
  
  personally speaking, it doesn't matter to me either way. i'm not close to my family and i wouldn't feel disrespected if my boyfriend asked me to marry him without consulting my parents first. after all, it's ultimately our decision.
  "
413471,"
   If someone you were romantically interested in brought up astrological signs on a date with you, would it be a turn on or a turn off? Would it matter if they brought it up humourously or seriously?
  ","
  it wouldn't sway me either way -- as long as they're not judging me solely based on my astrological sign, then i see nothing wrong with being interested in astrology. i have plenty of friends who fully believe in astrology and whatnot.
  
  i.e. if a prospective partner suddenly didn't want to date me anymore because they found out i was a scorpio, then that would be pretty disappointing. then again, it also wouldn't bother me very much because i wouldn't want to date a person to begin with if they didn't want to get to know me before judging me first.
  "
413472,"
   How often is too often for a partner to call or text you when you don't live together?
  ","
  i think it ultimately depends on the couple themselves, because it ranges depending on each person's needs.
  
  when my boyfriend and i don't see each other, we usually talk on the phone once or twice per day for 10-20 minutes each. we don't really text each other, though, because my boyfriend is terrible at texting and it's just easier to talk on the phone. this is what works for my relationship, though.
  "

   Baby gender reveal parties. At these parties expecting parents usually release either blue or pink helium balloons from a box to reveal whether the baby is a boy or a girl. What's your opinion on these parties?
  ","
  i see nothing wrong with gender reveals. it's literally just to announce the sex of your baby, and the fact that there are some strong opinions *against* gender reveals is a little ridiculous and overbearing.
  
  when children are babies, they have no concept of gender. so it's normal for parents to raise them according to their sex unless that child indicates that they feel otherwise somewhere down the line.

  i used to deal with that when i worked in retail -- i had some coworkers who were on a lower level than me in terms of promotions, and i was technically their manager if the assistant store manager or regular store manager weren't available. they would take it upon themselves to make decisions that should have gone by me first for approval, and they wouldn't communicate what they did to *anyone* so there was miscommunication within the store, which was difficult to handle.
  
  thankfully, it isn't something i've had to deal with working in office environments. granted, i've never really been in a supervisory position with these office jobs, but it isn't something i really notice. if it happens, it doesn't happen around me, lol.

   Do you believe in love at first sight?
  ","
  no, love at first sight doesn't exist. love is a deep, intimate connection you develop with a person over time. you cannot know if you love a person or not by simply meeting them for the first time. in those instances, the attraction you're feeling is simply lust.

  my coworker told me it was national ""drink wine"" day !! when i initially looked it up, national wine day is actually in may. but apparently national ""drink wine"" day is different. i think americans just want any excuse to be validated while they drown themselves in alcohol.
  
  regardless ... uh, yeah. i bought a bottle of wine after work. lmao.
  "
413492,"

413493,"

  ","
  that's not stupid at all, that's actually a really great thing that you seldom drink alcohol. most alcohol is absolutely terrible for you anyway, with the exception of perhaps a glass of red wine per night (allegedly).
  
  i've personally never been a fan of whiskey, scotch, bourbon, etc etc. it tastes too gross to me.

  i haven't had it in a long time, though. perhaps i'll pick a bottle up one of these days, it's definitely a good winter/night-time drink.
  "
413496,"
   Do you like to being busy all day?
  ","
  i like being busy for most of the day, but definitely not *all* day. i need some down time each day to collect my thoughts, relax, and recoup from the day. for me, that normally happens late at night when i have no responsibilities left to worry about for the evening.

  no, i don't have any plans for the summer. if anything, i'll be traveling to local places and perhaps spending a weekend here and there, so it isn't something i need to plan too far in advance.

413498,"
   Lads who act oveally manly saying I'm a man such and such is that off putting to you

  LOL. yeah, it shows how fragile their sense of masculinity is, because they're clearly insecure in themselves if they feel the need to constantly broadcast that they're a ""real man,"" or something along those lines.
  
  i don't have time in my life for people who think too much into masculinity versus femininity or feed into false stereotypes of what a ""real man"" or ""real woman"" should be.
  "
413499,"
   Do you think someone needs to be in their family to be apart of their family
  ","
  no, not at all. family isn't strictly by blood -- you can be seen as a part of someone's family even without being related to them if your relationship is close enough.
  
  my boyfriend's family is going on an extended vacation next year and they included me in their excursion, so i texted my boyfriend's step-mother sometime last week thanking her for including me, and she said, ""no need, you're family !!""
  
  i've been so close with his family for so long that they basically consider me part of the family now too, even though we're not engaged or anything, lol.

413511,"

  i would rather do exercises on my own as opposed to in a group, although it does motivate me more when i have someone there with me, such as my best friend or my boyfriend.

  ","
  my best friend and i couldn't coordinate our schedules anymore because she started working extra hours at work, so it discouraged me from returning to the gym because i didn't want to go alone.

  "
413655,"
   Online threats don’t scare you???

  it depends on the subject matter. it's easier for people to make me think twice about my opinion if i'm uneducated on something, since in those cases i'm willing to understand different sides of an issue. however, in cases where my opinion on something is firm, then nothing can change my mind.

  i don't really know much about hazing because neither of the colleges i went to had sororities or fraternities (that i'm aware of, lol). however, i do know that some hazing rituals are actually incredibly harmful, embarrassing, or dangerous, which doesn't make it sound worth joining the club, in my opinion.
  
  people in the clubs claim that they're doing it because it means they value their participation, or something along those lines, and it makes them closer in the long run. but i honestly don't believe you can care about someone while watching them endure such dangerous and bizarre hazing rituals. it's contradictory.

   If someone told you on your first date together that they're in love with you, how would you react? Is it cute or creepy? Is it insulting because they don't know you yet? Give your opinion.
  ","
  i would be a little alarmed, to say the least, because if they claim that they're in love with you solely based on *one* date, then they clearly must have created some fantasy of you that they're basing those feelings off of, instead of getting to know you over time.
  
  it's somewhat of a red flag and it can be seen as obsessive behavior. especially if they're looking at you and seeing only what they want to see instead of seeing you for how you actually are. they're creating an intimate connection over a fantasy of you, and that's not healthy at all.
  "
413682,"
   Do you personally differentiate between ""I love you"" and ""I'm in love with you""? Are they the same thing to you or do they mean different things? Why?
  ","
  to me personally, there's a remarkable difference between ""i love you"" and ""i'm in love with you.""
  
  the former saying can be applied both romantically *and* platonically because it's just an expression indicating your love and appreciation for a person, whether it's your partner, friends, or family. the latter, on the other hand, signifies a deep, intimate connection you feel towards someone on a romantic level.

  ","
  depends ultimately on my mood that day. sometimes i'm incredibly proud of the person i am, while other times i'm very disappointed in myself and believe i could do so much better than how i'm doing. i'm never really neutral on myself, it's either one extreme or the other, which can be overwhelming at times.

   After hours of editing, do you ever understand the desire of the avant-gardists to break through the sterility of formal writing?
  ","
  not really, no. i understand that everyone has a different style, however. one part of editing that's interesting to me is that each writer has a different voice and style, so it's important to respect those styles while still maintaining formality and conforming to the AP and in-house styles.
  
  also, i write creatively in my free time so that breaks up a lot of the monotony as well.
  "

   What about when the 2 terms connected by the ampersand are linked in the narrative flow (e.g. ""drinking & driving,"" ""husband & wife"")?

  it still isn't seen as formal, so no. the only times we're instructed to use ampersands are when they're included in the official names of organizations.
  "
413708,"

  no, that's not a formal style and i don't think it's encouraged in AP style. not unless it's the official name of an organization, like most law firms.

   Is your fear of abandonment rational or irrational?
  ","
  it's mostly irrational, especially considering my greatest fear in particular is my boyfriend leaving me. he's never given any notion that he would ever do such a thing, but it's still something i fear every day.
  "
413710,"
   Abandoned by people in what way do you mean?
  ","
  leaving me, i.e. ceasing contact with me with no discernable reason whatsoever to where i can't get closure. i become extremely attached to my friends and if they don't talk to me or respond to my messages, i assume they're angry with me or don't want anything to do with me, and i freak out.

  no, but i do fear abandonment.
  "
413713,"
   Do you ever falling love with people you can't have? Eheh
  ","
  that basically defined my entire teenagehood. well, i wouldn't necessarily say i fell in love with them, but i was infatuated with a lot of different people growing up and they never reciprocated those feelings.
  "
413714,"
   Have you ever run away from love because you were afraid of being hurt by losing it?
  ","
  no, i always craved love because i never felt like i received it adequately growing up, so i constantly sought after people (with failure, of course).
  "
413715,"
   Are you a materialist?
  ","
  somewhat, but not so much anymore. i still appreciate my simple pleasures, like coffee and cigarettes, but i value human interaction and having experiences moreso now than ever.

413716,"
   But what you do have doesn't last so what's the point of having it?
  ","
  you don't know for certain how long things will last, so the best thing you can do with any scenario is to appreciate it for what it's worth in the present moment and value it's existence in your life.
  "
413717,"
   Would you have chosen to not be born if that was a choice for you before you were born?
  ","
  i'm not entirely sure. i don't know what exists outside of ""life,"" and while i've struggled immensely in this life i've been given, i've also experienced genuine happiness and love as well. i've gotten over the whole ""i wish i was never born"" thought because i've learned to appreciate what i *do* have.

  no. nobody's face is perfectly symmetrical.
  "
413719,"
   Does a person have to have a life purpose in order to have a meaningful life?

  i don't necessarily think so, no. most people live their lives without finding a purpose that suits them, but that doesn't mean that their life is meaningless. you can still have a fulfilling, meaningful life without knowing what your purpose is.
  "
413720,"
   What did you buy for him? Do you always exchange gifts?

  "
413721,"
   Are you basically a sensitive kind of person?

  it ultimately depends on my mood, because sometimes i'm extremely sensitive while other times i'm a cold hearted b*tch, lmao.
  "
413722,"
   Do you have your own personal ideology?
  ","
  sorta, but it's more like a mantra -- ""if you're going through hell, keep going.""
  
  basically meaning that if you encounter struggles in your life, the best thing you can do is continue living and making the best out of your situation. most experiences are temporary, and while it's okay to feel discouraged, you shouldn't allow the situation to break you down.

  if you really want to express strong apathy, you would say ""i couldn't care less.""
  
  that implies that you basically have no f*cks left to give -- meanwhile, ""i could care less"" means that while you don't care, there's still a part of you that does and you have a few f*cks to give left within you.

   I'm from the UK I hear loads of stereotypes stuff about the USA. Because you're from the USA  what stereotypes stuff have you heard about the UK
  ","
  the only stereotypes i can recall right now are that people from the UK are supposed to have horrible teeth & drink tea basically all the time, LOL.

   How long should you wait until a relationship until you say I love you how long did you wait until you said it in your relationship
  ","
  it goes on an individualized basis, i believe. some people say it sooner than others, it all depends on the relationship dynamics and how comfortable you feel with your partner.
  
  i don't remember when i first told my boyfriend i loved him, LOL. that's going back 9-10 years ago, but it was probably in an appropriate time and setting considering we're still together & i didn't scare him away.
  "
413792,"
   What social media do you have
  ","
  askfm (obviously), facebook, instagram, twitter, snapchat, tumblr, and tellonym.
  "
413793,"
   Has anyone ever written you a love letter
  ","
  yes, my boyfriend writes me letters occasionally on special holidays !! he'll either include it inside of a card or write me a letter that goes alongside whatever gift he bought me. i've always adored classic displays of romance like that.
  "
413794,"
   Are bad teeth a deal breaker when you are dating someone?
  ","
  only if they don't take care of their teeth or have proper hygiene. people can't exactly help the way their teeth grow in, but if they're not brushing and flossing every day, then that's gross.
  "
413795,"
   Do you know everything about your bf/husband
  ","
  i'm sure i don't know everything there is to know about him. humans are incredibly complex, multifaceted creatures, and it's near impossible to know every single, little thing about an individual, regardless of how close you are to them.
  "
413796,"
   What do u do in ur spare time?
  ","
  lately i've been spending my spare time watching netflix before bed. i only really have 2-3 hours of time to myself per day, so in those hours, i just want to relax and recoup.
  "
413797,"
   What was your least favorite subject in school?
  ","
  i disliked gym class, as well as basically any math class i was in. i'm pretty sure i hated calculus, but i don't remember at this point.
  "
413798,"
   Do you journal every day? Or own a diary?
  ","
  i have a mindfulness journal with daily prompts, but i haven't written in it in a few weeks. it's an extremely helpful journal, though. it allows you to focus on the present moment and be thoughtful of what's going on in the now, as opposed to dwelling too much on the past or future.
  "
413799,"
   Are you trying to lose weight?
  ","
  not actively, at the moment. my boyfriend said that he'll start going to the gym with me, though, so that gives me more motivation to actually hop onto the whole ""fitness"" thing.
  "
413800,"
   Hows everyone night or day going? 

Hugs
  ","
  my day went all right -- nothing significant happened, it was an average work day. it felt like the day dragged, though. time wasn't going fast enough.
  
  i got home not too long ago & now i'm just planning on relaxing and getting an early night's rest.

  it's all good !! thanks for understanding.
  "
413802,"
   Were you ever in any AP classes for writing in high school? And were you always advanced in comparison to your peers, or did you start out relatively ""average"" but then gradually gained more written knowledge that grew into your talent today?
  ","
  yeah, i was in a lot of AP classes when i was in high school, actually. although i did take AP literature and AP grammar as well.
  
  i don't remember what my skill level used to be compared to my peers because i don't remember my really old writings, but i do know that i scored in the 99th percentile on the writing portion of the SAT, if that counts for anything.
  "
413803,"
   Do you have a tumblr? If so what is it. I enjoy following new people :)
  ","
  i do, but it's an anonymous tumblr and i don't like giving my url out publicly. it's mainly a venting blog.

413804,"
   this is probably one of my favorite pictures of you, i don't know what it is but something about it makes you look so adorable and flattering
  ","
  AW, this is so cute !! thank you, lovely ~~
  "
413805,"
   What are you really good at?
  ","
  my only skill is in writing, haha. i can describe nearly anything via the written word and i've always had an advanced understanding of what flows well.
  "
413806,"
   my point was you don't live in a vaccum. you're influenced by ""fashion statements/fashion""
  ","
  probably to some degree, sure. i just don't pay conscious attention to what's trending. i do things because i want to do them, usually out of impulse if i'm being honest, lmao.
  "
413807,"
   so has most of humanity? unnatural colors have been popular for the last few years etc
  ","
  i agree with you. that doesn't mean my hair is a fashion statement, though. lol.

413808,"
   Basically about 3 weeks ago I got my eyes tested because I had my first driving lesson the doctors said I'm fine. When I went for my lesson I failed the reading the licence plates so I couldn't have my lesson. I went back to the doctors and they retested me and said I'm fine but clearly not any idea
  ","
  obviously your eyes aren't fine because you failed the visual portion of the lesson. i would find a new eye doctor if i was in your position. it's not bad to get a second opinion, and it's going to help you in the long run.
  "
413809,"
   How are you at giving advice i got ìnto a little weird situation don't know what to do nothing serious thou
  ","
  i can try giving you advice, but i can't guarantee anything.
  "
413810,"
   Did your fish die
  ","
  yeah. :// he died about a month ago. i had him for over a year, my boyfriend couldn't believe he lived for as long as he did considering corycats from pet stores have a short lifespan.

  i don't have any pets atm, so here's a selfie of me at the bar last week.

413812,"
   Why your father? Is he nice?
  ","
  yes, he's a genuinely good person who has struggled with his own demons. he did some sh*tty things in the past, but through therapy, i learned that it was a coping mechanism for him in an effort to deal with my mother. since then, i'm empathized with him more, especially considering he's recently been more understanding and forgiving of my feelings.
  "
413813,"
   How’s your relationship with your parents? Are you closer to your father or mother?
  ","
  me and my parents co-exist, but that's the extent of our relationship. i don't really speak to them with casual conversation, it's always been on a need-to-know basis.
  
  i'm not close with either of them exactly, but i do empathize with my father more.
  "
413814,"
   Whats the most expensive thing you've ever broken? ?
  ","
  i broke part of the screen on my ipad within the first few months of having it, if that counts. it still works, but it still has this horrendous crack across the entire screen.
  "
413815,"
   In your opinion, what act would definitely make someone a bad person?
  ","
  a bad person, in my eyes, is someone who intentionally hurts other people with no remorse because of their own selfish needs -- usually extreme examples, like p*dophiles, m*rderers, and other ab*sers.
  "
413816,"
   What was the last nice thing you did for yourself?
  ","
  i treated myself to a caramel macchiatto on lunch today. i needed the extra boost & it was the perfect drink to get in light of the weather this afternoon.
  "
413817,"
   What's up?
  ","
  nothing really. i just got home from work, which i'm really thankful for because the weather has been absolutely horrible today and i was worried about getting into a car accident on the way home.
  
  it's been snowing, sleeting, and raining since 10am so everything is really slippery.
  "
413818,"
   If you celebrate it, do you have any plans for Valentines? :3 Are you spending it with a loved one, or having a treat yourself day? :D (staif) <3
  ","
  i don't believe i'm seeing my boyfriend on valentine's day because he's working late that night, but we'll probably see each other the following night !!
  
  we don't usually do much anyway. we treat each other to a small gift or two, but that's pretty much it. we don't need a holiday to tell us to appreciate each other.
  "
413819,"
   Use this to brag about yourself or something good that happened recently. Umm I lost 8 pounds.. But I’m still fat though.But it’s ok I’ll get there
  ","
  a client e-mailed my supervisor to tell her that whoever wrote her online feature was a wonderful writer & she was pleased with the work.
  
  i was the writer. :')) that made my week last week.
  "
413820,"
   Have you ever reconnected with an old friend? How was it?
  ","
  yeah, i reconnected with a friend i used to talk to when i was in middle and high school because i had questions about my past. we haven't talked regularly since then, but we do message each other perhaps once a month or so to catch up.
  "
413821,"
   wtf are you talking about? fashion statements don't just appeal to fhe general public and your hair changes are obviously influenced by fashion trends
  ","
  my hair is influenced by a fashion trend ?? that's news to me, rofl. i've been shaving and coloring my hair for years now.
  "
413822,"

  i have a hyundai accent.

  non-binary. lol.

413824,"
   Last time you donated some money?
  ","
  i think i donated money to a friend's gofundme a few months ago. i don't remember when it was exactly.
  "
413825,"
   But you change your hair color frequently.  Isn't that making a fashion statement?
  ","
  not really, no. i'm not doing it on purpose to appease others, i'm doing it for myself. if i wanted to make a fashion statement then i would have done something that appealed to the general public.
  "
413826,"
   Why do you have to maintain shaved portions of your head?
  ","
  uh, so that they remain shaved. lol. my hair grows fast and i don't want to shave it out just yet.
  "
413827,"
   Do you actually love someone ???
  ","
  yes, i love my boyfriend.
  "
413828,"
   I'm very confused, what is non-binary? Is it the same as transgender or different?
  ","
  it's under the trans umbrella, yes !! it basically means that you don't identify as either of the gender binaries (man or woman).
  "
413829,"
   What’s your opinion on women who do that whole make your own gender up thing such as
   
    @bornofsaltandsmoke
   
   and
   
    @urlsareshittbh
   
   and
   
    @poetalunam
   
   ?
  ","
  looking at the responses to this question, it looks like anon's intention totally backfired. LOL.
  
  who cares. someone else's gender doesn't affect your life, trans people shouldn't be demonized just for existing.
  "
413830,"
   What's the last thing you did for someone out of kindness?
  ","
  allowed a friend to vent to me about a personal problem they've been having and offered them my advice. it's been spanned out over the course of like two days since we've been texting about this problem, but i'm always here for my friends if they need support.
  "
413831,"
   Does this annoy you? People who can't mind their own buiness does that annoy you?
  ","
  i'm sure it annoys everyone to some degree.
  "
413832,"
   Do you have any frenemies

  no ?? why would i be friends with someone who doesn't like me or vice versa. lol.
  "
413833,"
   ""You"" is a series about a stereotypically attractive, dangerous stalker named Joe who's capable of devastating things. If you've seen it, what's your opinion on the fans who want to be with Joe and want Joe to stalk them?! Are you one of those fans? Do you think they missed the point of the show?
  ","
  that's honestly terrifying that people look at that character and say to themselves, ""that's my ideal partner."" they're blinded by the romanticization of similar characters to him, where instead of focusing on the terrible things they did, they genuinely believe that they're doing it out of unconditional love.
  
  it's dangerous, especially if those fans are young and think that his behavior in the show is okay. that might lead them to pursue similar real-life relationships in the future.
  "
413834,"
   Are you good at organising things? Do you think you'd excel in a job as an Events Manager or even a Wedding Planner?? ??
  ","
  even though the idea completely overwhelms me, i actually do enjoy planning events and vacations and whatnot. i used to do most of the planning when my boyfriend and i would go on vacation, either just the two of us or with friends, and i genuinely enjoyed making a small notebook of dates, times, finances, etc etc.
  
  right now, my boyfriend, myself, and his family are planning a massive vacation for next year, which makes me really excited. i'm also a bit nervous because a lot of preparation is involved, but it's going to be *so* worth it.
  "
413835,"
   What is something you really love to do in your free time? ?
  ","
  uh, sleep. LOL.
  
  other than that, i enjoy relaxing with a cup of coffee while talking to my boyfriend or a close friend. sometimes i'll also grab a drink with a friend at night if i feel like socializing for a change, but otherwise, i'm content with laying down and watching television or playing video games by myself.
  "
413836,"
   Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
  ","
  i'm in a relationship, so i suppose my boyfriend is technically my date. but we're not actually doing anything for valentine's day. he's working late that night, so i probably won't be able to see him until the following night.
  "
413837,"
   Do you read classic literature?
  ","
  i read classic literature when i was in college, considering i was an english literature minor, but since graduating, i haven't read any of the classics.
  "
413838,"
   Why not just cis straight men. Why white men..
  ","
  idk, the anon decided to throw ""white"" into the question. i just answered accordingly, lol.
  "
413839,"
   Did you guys miss my questions? 

Have you ever took a week long absence from here or other sites?
  ","
  i was honestly concerned because i noticed you weren't answering questions, and then i saw your name that said you were on a hiatus. LOL.
  
  i took a year off of askfm quite a few years ago because i needed to focus more on my education, it was while i was finishing up college. other than that, i haven't really taken any complete breaks from social media.
  "
413840,"
   Did you enjoy the weekend?
  ","
  my weekend was pretty good, besides the whole medication fiasco (which was *just* resolved, so i can rest easy now).
  
  i spent the majority of the weekend working and spending time with my boyfriend, so i have no complaints. spending time with my favorite person *and* getting extra money ?? yes pls.
  "
413841,"
   What's your favourite colour? ??

  it really depends on my mood, but lately i've been into dark blue, turquoise, sea green, etc etc.
  "
413842,"
   What work are you putting off for later?
  ","
  i finished all of my work for the day !! :'))
  
  the only things i'm planning on doing for the rest of the night are curling up into a blanket burrito, watching television, and sleeping.

  "
413844,"
   What was your first concert? How old were you? What year was it?

  my first concert was a conglomeration of artists from a radio station -- the only people i remember being there are shaggy and lisa marie presley, lol.

   Quick Don McClean story: I was at a cocktail reception for the owner of a large corporation I once worked for. Lots of memorabilia there and he owned a spiral notebook page with the original lyrics to ""American Pie"" written in pencil by McClean himself. Coolest thing I think I've ever seen :)
  ","
  ah, that's awesome !! i love seeing memorabilia like that, it's partially the reason why i like going to the hard rock cafe whenever i go into manhattan, even though it's a super touristy place.
  "
413846,"
   What's your mood like atm?
  ","
  i'm in a decent mood, actually. :')) i'm listening to all of the songs my boyfriend and i listened to last night when we were hanging out and relaxing, and it brings me peace.

  "
413849,"
   What are your thoughts on straight, cis white men?
  ","
  it's difficult to have a single thought that encompasses an entire group of people with different values and ideas.
  
  a staggering number of straight, cis white men are incredibly ignorant, but obviously that doesn't mean *all* men who are straight, cis, and white behave that way.
  "
413850,"
   Do you see your hair as a fashion accessory?
  ","
  not really, no. my hair is just hair -- something that i can customize to make me feel the most like ""myself,"" much like how someone accumulates tattoos on their body. i like changing my hair color often because i get tired of having the same color for too long.
  "
413851,"
   Do you wear Vans?If so do you prefer the laces or the slip ons?
  ","
  i used to wear the slip-on checkered vans in high school -- mostly because i was a scene kid, which was honestly horrifying.

  both, haha. he's a cisgender man.

   Lately, people(mostly women) have been shaving their face to apply makeup better & more smoothly. It's been a trend that's catching on. People(mostly men) have also been shaving their legs for the first time just to see how good it feels on new bed sheets. Have you ever done either of these things?
  ","
  i've never shaved my face for the purpose of applying makeup, no. i wax my upper lip and eyebrows though.
  
  as for my legs, you're lucky if i shave my legs at all, lmao. i do admit, having shaved legs feels nice on satin sheets, but it's way too much effort to shave when it's only going to grow back in within the next day.
  "
413854,"

   To whom are your audio and video recordings open?
  ","
  i don't have any audio recordings on my phone. i have a few videos, but they're all of my boyfriend's pets, so it isn't something that would be of interest to anyone else besides us.

  "
413857,"
   Do you use food discount coupons when you buy food
  ","
  yes, i try to use any coupons i can find, which are normally in the weekly flyers that come with the newspaper. you can also find some helpful coupons online as well that you just have to print out and clip.
  
  i splurged on some chapstick and a valentine's day card for my boyfriend tonight because i had a $7 extrabucks from CVS, LOL.
  "
413858,"

  everything has been wonderful, actually. we're in the process of planning a massive family vacation next year. :'))
  "
413859,"
   Should your gf/bf challenge you
  ","
  i believe that certain extents of challenging your partner is healthy in a relationship, yes. ideally, your partner should inspire and motivate you to be a better version of yourself, which also includes calling you out on your bullsh*t if you're making excuses in an attempt to not do something.
  "
413860,"
   Do you live with your parents?
  ","
  yeah, i live with my parents at the moment.
  "
413861,"
   What is favourite pick me up when you're sad
  ","
  the best thing for me when i'm sad or depressed is to be around my boyfriend. he knows how to make me feel better without overstepping boundaries, and he understands that it's often the smaller things that have a tendency to give me hope, like forehead kisses or waking me up to a freshly made cup of coffee or allowing me to sleep in if i need a day to sleep.
  "
413862,"
   Look wise do you look like your mother or father?
  ","
  i can see both of them within myself, actually. i have my father's nose and mouth, but i have my mother's eyes. i inherited the short (as in height) gene from my mother's side of the family, but i have the analytical nature and some psychological issues that also stem from my father's side.
  "
413863,"
   Do you try to change your external appearance much?
  ","
  the only thing about my external appearance that i change often is my hair. i usually color it every 4-5 months or so, and i have to maintain the shaved portions of my head as well.
  "
413864,"

  i'm doing well !! i had a very productive day today, and i even ran errands after work and *finally* got a call back from my doctor regarding my anxiety medication.

  "
413865,"
   Do you hate flossing? If not often do you floss?

  i don't mind flossing because it feels better when i'm done. i floss once per day.

413871,"
   are you centrism or conservative? why?
  ","
  i'm definitely not conservative, haha. if anything, i'm between centrist and leftist. my beliefs align with those ideals the most.
  "
413872,"
   In England a “bird” usually means a woman, not a pnis, though I guess it could be a regional dialect. But “bird” is very common slang across the UK, and people talking about “my bird” are definitely more likely to be talking about their girlfriend. I’ve never heard it used for pnis here myself.
  ","
  perhaps it is more of a specific regional thing, like the other anon said they heard of it referred to a penis as well.
  
  i mean... i've always just called it a penis. or a d*ck, haha.
  "
413873,"
   Thoughts on ddlg and cg/l?

  my favorite food is sushi, and lately i haven't been all that interested in pasta. it all tastes the same to me.
  
  tonight, i'm having chicken parm and salad with my boyfriend and his family.

  HAHA. it makes me wonder why strangers on the internet are curious about my boyfriend's penis.
  "
413876,"
   this person may not be from america, not sure if it's just me but i'm from england and a lot of ppl here call a pnis a ""bird"" as slang haha
  ","
  probably !! that's what i was thinking, it's interesting how each region of the world has it's own slang terms.
  "
413877,"
   how do you react when someone says your behaviour is like a stuck up person?
  ","
  if that personally happened to me, then i would simply shrug it off and be reminded that their opinion isn't necessarily factual. i would perhaps ask them why they thought that way and take that into consideration, but if it's totally false, then there isn't much else you can do.
  "
413878,"
   what color is your pee?
  ","
  this sounds like a fetish question. i'll never understand how certain people have urine fetishes, it makes no sense to me. it's literally bodily waste.

  me too. the woman in HR has had her own host of medical issues, and there are a lot of people in my office who deal with mental health issues (including my immediate boss, whom i've spoken to multiple times about my problems). so i think that she's more sympathetic than anything else because she knows what it's like to be struggling.
  
  i've never used FMLA before, but i do have the paperwork in case anything does happen. i was out of work for about a week with my last job when i was first diagnosed because i was very s*icidal, but that job was fine with just a doctor's note excusing me from working for the week.

  i don't know if there was any silver lining associated with it besides the lesson that i need to take better care of myself. thankfully, my company was completely understanding of what i went through and offered their help if needed, and HR even said that it's good that i knew to leave work because i have to take care of myself first and foremost.

   Last year the law here changed regarding transporting a dog in the car. The dog now must be restrained by a seatbelt, or put in the boot section with a guard. Failure to comply invalidates one’s insurance and can lead to a £2,500 fine. What’s your opinion on this new rule?
  ","
  it sounds like the rule is meant to keep dogs safe in the car, which is something i fully support. there are so many people who travel with their dogs in their laps or unrestrained in the backseat, which can lead to a lot of distractions and possible accidents.
  
  i've never traveled with my own dog in the car, but when my boyfriend and i are transporting his dog to places like to get groomed or going to the vet, we usually have him on the leash in the backseat with a cover over the seats that prevents him from climbing into the front seat. thankfully, his dog behaves really well in the car and just lays down the entire time, so it isn't something we had to worry about.

  ","
  i think dreams are either randomized or they're reflections of our subconscious. sometimes dreams can be meaningful, but there are also dreams which are utterly meaningless, which makes dream interpretation tricky.
  
  i think most of my dreams are meaningless, but i've also had a few dreams that did indicate i was stressed out or upset (like the climbing up a hill or teeth falling out ones). i also used to have frequent nightmares which were very graphic, and i think those were also indications of my stress levels too.

  it was the best decision i honestly could have ever made. his family *still* talks about how helpful i was & how grateful they are that i was home to help them during that time, because no one else in their lives stepped up to help at all. and that was nine years ago.
  
  sometimes even the simplest decisions can make a huge impact on people. returning home meant the world to him and his family, even though they didn't expect me to make that leap, and i put myself in a better headspace because it prompted me to mature and be responsible. i would have gone down a darker road, i expect, had i stayed in massachusetts.
  "
413985,"
   if you dont mind me asking, why did you come back?
  ","
  it was really complicated, so there were multiple reasons. the first reason was that i was severely depressed my first year of college, and i ended up failing the same class two semesters in a row (which was unheard of for me, considering i got straight As in high school). the second reason was that my boyfriend's mother passed away, among other things going wrong with his family, so i felt the need to be closer to him to help him and his family during that hard part of their lives.
  
  it was overall a better, healthier decision for me. i flourished when i returned home, and i was also able to remain close with my boyfriend and his family and help them out whenever they needed it during that transition phase, among other things.

  talking on the phone has always given me terrible anxiety. it's difficult for me to explain things verbally to begin with, but over the phone makes it 10x worse for some reason.
  
  i.e. i had a phone at my last job and sometimes i would have to speak to clients about their cases. which always gave me either horrible anxiety or a full-blown panic attack. i dreaded going to work each day because of not only the general stress of the job, but also because of the possibility of having to talk to clients on the phone. they were never pleasant experiences either.
  "
413989,"
   How do you feel about taking on the phone? And what about video chatting?
  ","
  i only talk to my boyfriend on the phone -- i prefer that over texting because he's terrible at texting back, and it's easier to have a conversation verbally than through text.

   Sapiosxual is a term used to describe someone attracted primarily to intelligence and educated people. Does this apply to you? Would you date a sapiosxual?

  i've always rolled my eyes at all of these weird orientations that have popped up recently, because i feel as if people are trying to slap the ""queer"" label onto something that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with being gay. sapios*xual is one of them.
  
  most people are attracted to intelligence to begin with, so it's not out of the ordinary for people to look at someone and find them more attractive because they're either educated or highly intelligent. while education is indeed a privilege, you don't necessarily have to have a formal education in order to be intelligent either. sometimes it just comes naturally.

   What do you think of adults aged 30 who still live with their parents? Do you think parents should kick them out?
  ","
  it entirely depends on the reason why they're home to begin with. if they're not motivated and aren't actively working or going to school or anything, then i think the parents need to be strict with them and help them get their sh*t straightened out.
  
  however, if they're actively working, or going to school, and generally trying to do what they can to make the most out of their life, then i see no reason for them to be kicked out. most of the time, people of that age don't *want* to live at home but they don't have any other choice, whether it's for personal, medical, or financial reasons.

  i believe it means that if we get our heart broken, it does take us a bit of time to come to terms with the heartbreak and open ourselves up to the possibility of meeting someone new. however, our view on love is indefinitely changed from that experience, and we're constantly being shaped by our experiences with love, whether it's romantic or platonic.

  this sorta coincides with my last answer regarding toxic masculinity, actually. the whole point of the commercial is to challenge toxic masculinity and give examples as to how men in general can improve, especially in terms of teaching their children how to behave instead of brushing off problematic behavior as ""boys will be boys.""
  
  instead, people have misinterpreted the commercial to be an attack on men as a whole, and like i stated in my previous answer, it seems as if the only people who are offended by the commercial are those who feed into toxic masculinity because they're been so brainwashed by it over the years.

   What sort of impression do you get from someone who says ""not all *insert type of person*""?

  i think it entirely depends on the context it's in. because there are some instances where it's factually correct to say ""not all x do y."" it's a simple fact of life, but there are also moments where people say that phrase as a means of backing themselves up if they're not making a valid point or they're using it as a scapegoat.
  
  i.e. ""not all men."" when men become combative when people critique toxic masculinity, sometimes the whole ""not all men"" thing comes up. however, it's fully evident that it isn't all men who behave that way. however, the problem arises when there's such a societal expectation for men to behave in a specific way and *that's* what we're focusing on. the people who get offended by that are usually the ones who are feeding into those stereotypes.

  -- i don't support the use of puberty blockers on children who are transgender. there's not enough research done on the subject & puberty blockers can be detrimental to a child's development.
  
  -- climate change/global warming is a real threat to the existence of this planet. i can't believe this is actually an unpopular opinion these days, but there are surprisingly a lot of people who don't think climate change is real.
  
  -- minimum wage needs to be raised in order to meet the standard of living for each respective region. the minimum wage is not a livable wage anymore.
  
  -- drinking alcohol every day is *not* healthy, and the glamorization of alcohol abvse in american culture (and some other cultures around the world) is damaging. people are in denial about their alcoholism because it's socially acceptable to drink every night.
  
  -- i don't support the self-diagnosis of mental illnesses other than simple depression and anxiety. if you think you might have x disorder, then do everything in your power to see a physician. if you cannot see a physician, then do not claim to have that disorder.

  i don't personally believe so. just because you don't feel sexual attraction doesn't mean you're queer or part of the lgbtq+ community. it's lack of a sexual attraction, not a sexual attraction that deviates from what's been socially acceptable.
  
  if you want to really get into it and talk about romantic orientations, and if an ace person has romantic attractions to people that selects them for inclusion in the community, then maybe they do belong there. however, i've never given much credit to such micro-attractions because i don't personally feel like there should be a need to label *everything*.

  i think it still has a use, yeah. you can describe people's behaviors and personalities without applying mental illness to the equation. behavioral psychology is really just the study of why people behave the way they do, what factors in their environments and genetics influences that, and what we can do to cope with or reverse behaviors. sometimes it has nothing to do with mental illness, and we need both behavioral and clinical psychologists to differentiate the difference.

   2. I feel that people who argue that it doesn't exist just re-invent the definition to include a systemic discrimination component to the actual definition, & I don't feel that it's right to modify a definition to fit our beliefs. But maybe I'm wrong and I want to understand. Can you explain please?
  ","
  definitions aren't absolute. they may have existed to define an ideology at one point in time, but like all other forms of linguistics, definitions change as society changes. language is constantly evolving, so we have to change our definitions of things as society evolves.
  
  from my understanding of it, racism refers to the systemic oppression of races -- which doesn't include white folk, because in most cases of history, white people were the ones who were performing the oppressing, not being oppressed themselves. that's why racism refers to the oppression of races other than white. obviously white people still face discrimination, but those are isolated incidents compared to the grand scheme of things.

  i think it depends on a lot of factors, not solely the fact that they're raising their child to eat vegetarian food. it also has to do with whether or not they're open to the child exploring other tastes if they express the desire to do so, how strict they are with food intake, etc etc. that changes whether or not it can be a positive or a negative thing.

  i'm sure you already got this answer multiple times, but the first character that comes to mind is hermione granger from the harry potter series. in the books, she's described as a generally unattractive, mousy girl with kinky brown hair, and the series is focused on her intelligence as opposed to her looks. there's one point where she transforms so much during a formal occasion that the entire rest of the characters are shocked that it's her.

   Have you ever worked retail? If so, what's the silliest question you've ever been asked?
  ","
  i worked retail for four years when i was a bit younger. i don't really remember what the silliest question was, but i do remember a lot of customers getting irrationally angry over the fact that we didn't take expired coupons or coupons that weren't for the items they purchased. some people even told us they left the coupons at home, but still wanted us to apply them anyway. it was ridiculous.

  a criminal who blends in with everyone else is scarier, in my opinion. they're usually calm, collected, and intelligent. you can't imagine them committing the crimes they've committed, but they have that beast within them locked behind closed doors and can release it whenever they feel like it.

  in general, i don't usually care about what tattoos people get as long as it makes them happy. however, face tattoos are a really risky move for obvious reasons and the only redeeming factors are if the tattoos are done well.

   another issue with the glamorizarion of alcohol is that people from adults to teens alike believe that you need alcohol to have fun. being severely hungover and not even remembering what you did the night before is considered proof you had a good night. drinking is almost expected of you now.

   Same here. Irish drinking culture is awful! In Ireland and the UK we even have reality TV shows where the gaurds/cops are followed by a camera crew so they can film drunken people getting arrested and the outcome of their arrest etc. Entertaining to say the least, but still awful.
  ","
  sounds like the show cops in the united states, LOL. it's ridiculous.
  
  the main issue i have with binge drinking and the culture surrounding alcohol in general is that it gives off the impression that drinking in excess on a regular basis is somehow normal and safe. it isn't glamorous to drink every night, especially considering most people don't know how to only stick to one drink. it's caused a lot of confusion with my own alcohol consumption because for a long time, i thought my consumption wasn't an issue. it wasn't until i started drinking in excess 3-4 times per week that i realized it was problematic.
  "
414453,"
   No, in France wine is mostly just a cultural thing and they have one glass with dinner as opposed to binge drinking, thank goodness. So the split in age is mostly to get them used to alcohol before they drink stronger alcohol.

  i somewhat agree, but i also disagree at the same time -- if that makes sense. i think anything that's militant is generally bad because it's extremism, and most people who are militant wind up being extremely ignorant, close-minded, and unwilling to accept viewpoints that are contrary to their own.
  
  that being said, i also believe that antifascism is obviously better than fascism. i don't really know what a militant antifascist would look like because all you're really advocating for is the disassembling of a government which reigns supreme.

   “locks only keep honest people out”. what do you think of this saying ? do you think with this being applied, that locking your car and front door is pointless ?
  ","
  i disagree with the statement. on a metaphorical level, it can refer to the idea that people who are cautious to trust others are only closed off to people who are honest or willing to help them. however, coming from personal experience, it's somewhat of a good thing to be hesitant to trust people because you simply do not know their intentions. there are honest people out there, sure, but there are also others who only wish to harm you. the honest people will understand your need for privacy.

  strangely enough, the show ""you"" moved me and made me critically think about a lot of different things. i was also inspired by beck's passion for writing and she definitely encapsulated the feelings of being a writer who wants to pursue their passion but also feels the need to gain new experiences in order to write something.

   Everyone needs something different in a relationship & we're forever growing as people. 5yrs ago I needed someone fun,loyal,lively. Now I need someone who will push me to succeed, is honest & emotionally mature, is spontaneous & responsible. What do you need out of a relationship when you're in one?
  ","
  my relationship has certainly been interesting because we've been together for 10 years. when we were both 17/18 years old, we needed something completely different out of our relationship than what we need now. back then, we needed someone who was fun, spontaneous to the point of impulsivity, full of passion, and always willing to take on a challenge, no matter how risky it would be.
  
  since we've matured, our needs have also matured and what we used to need eventually disappeared and re-appeared as newer, more responsible necessities. emotional maturity, loyalty, a willingness to work hard to earn a living, diligence, responsibility, and holding the idea that we must move on from our past to pursue a better future.

  ","
  ugh, yeah -- i agree with that opinion. it's disgusting how middle aged people will find it somehow okay to maintain an interest in people who are either underage or just barely adults. even though it's legally okay once they turn 18, it's still a red flag for abvse.
  
  most people who are much older than their partners like that (i'm talking about people who are under 20 dating people 35+) are dating them for the power play and the fact that they can easily take advantage of them.
  "
414465,"
   In France, it's legal for 16year olds to drink beer and wine. Whereas spirits and liquor are only legal when 18 and above. What's your opinion on the legal age for alcohol consumption being split like this?
  ","
  that's interesting -- i never knew that before. i don't really see the reason why there's such a split because they all get you drunk either way, but i'm also basing this off of the american idolization/normalization of alcohol abvse since it's all i've ever known. i'm sure alcohol consumption isn't glamorized as much in other countries as it is in the united states.

  this is an incredibly vague message, so i don't really have a concise idea as to how to help you. if you did something wrong that put a bad spotlight on you, the best thing you can do is own up to your mistake and vow to never do it again, as well as take the appropriate actions to right that mistake to the best of your ability.
  
  management likes seeing people take responsibility for their actions, it shows commitment as well as maturity. in some cases, they might not care but it's better to err on the safe side rather than do nothing about it.

  lust is a physical attraction you have towards someone upon meeting them. lust is superficial and is expressed through carnal desires.
  
  love, on the other hand, runs much deeper than lust. love is when you know of a person's flaws and still cherish their existence in your life. love is being able to say that you would take a bullet for someone if it meant saving their life. love is believing in the best in a person and helping them work towards becoming the best version of themselves they can be.

  i have this one friend whom i've forgiven way too much in the past & i think it's time to distance myself from him and eventually end the friendship.
  
  he's a good person by heart, but he's selfish and doesn't think for himself. i just found out he's been backstabbing my boyfriend & spreading his business without his consent, and that's not okay at all. not to mention the fact that he owed me money in the past and still tries to pull fast ones on me despite the fact that i gave him the benefit of the doubt and forgave him the first time.
  
  i'm tired of it, and he's also screwed over my boyfriend too many times to count. i'm not going to sit here and continue to be friends with him when he's hurt my boyfriend so much. he never learns his lesson & every time he says he'll change, he goes back to his old ways. there's only so much we can take.

   Society over the years has formed a list of things that ""influence people to do wrong"" for example black clothing, enjoying the occult, dark movies, violent video games, bdsm, metal music, having body mods. What do you think influences people to do wrong? Do you think any of these things are linked?
  ","
  most of those interests aren't linked to bad or violent behavior, such as violent video games, BDSM, metal music or having body modifications. in that, they don't directly cause bad behavior and they're not going to turn a person from a law-abiding citizen into a criminal.
  
  however, i do believe that people who are inherently bad or violent do have a tendency to lean towards violence in the media because it can be seen as an outlet for their aggression. they often fantasize about violence and the media is the only socially acceptable way for them to maintain their interests without them going out and doing those behaviors themselves.

  i don't think veganism is the future because there are still *so* many people who either cannot sustain a vegan diet or simply don't want to. i think it's wonderful that there are so many vegetarian and vegan options out now though, it's a lot healthier than eating meat and dairy products all the time.

  aw, thank you ~~
  
  2019 is going rather well, actually. i've been quite productive and i even wrote a short story/essay/thing within the past two weeks that i finished today. i just need to proofread it a few more times and see if there are any ways to improve it.

  i used to meditate when i was younger, or at least *try* to meditate, but i only successfully did it a few times. my mind is usually racing and it's difficult for me to calm down and get into that sort of mindset, especially with my anxiety.

   I just made the hardest decision of my life I broke up with someone that I love and I broke their heart. I broke up with them because I knew it’s gonna work. Anyone have tips on how to be happy? I just want to cry. If you don’t have anything nice to say just delete it. Thanks for listening
  ","
  i'm sorry you're feeling this way. i assume you meant that it *wasn't* going to work. however, any breakup hurts both people involved, but eventually the pain does get easier to cope with as long as you have support.
  
  if you need to cry, then cry -- there's nothing wrong with it. crying releases endorphins which makes you feel better.
  "
414761,"
   I guess I was upset when I told them that. But honestly, they could’ve explained and I would’ve listened bc I cared. But it seemed like they never really cared. They never even apologized. But it’s okay. :)
  ","
  telling you that they'll make it up to you is somewhat an apology. however, i don't know the situation because i don't know who you or your friend are, so i can only base my answers off of what you've given me.
  
  regardless, i believe it's something you two should discuss considering you obviously still care.

  honestly, i doubt they'll talk to you about it because the way you responded *was* a bit insensitive and gives off the impression that you don't care. even though they were rude, they told you that they would make it up to you, but you brushed it off.

  i think it depends on the individual. ironically, i recently had another anon post in my inbox about how they feel terrible about their physical appearance and prefer how they look through snapchat.
  
  i do have to admit, most of my selfies are taken through snapchat because it clears up my skin and thins out my face. however, i already have low self esteem to begin with, so idk if it really has an effect on it at all.

  on a regular day where i feel motivated, i'll usually do laundry and clean. i also run errands sometimes early in the morning if i need to pick anything up from the store. however, if i'm exhausted or not feeling up to anything, then i usually just stay home and catch up on sleep.

   What is your opinion on the new abortion law?
  ","
  for those who don't know, the new abortion law in new york state says that people can have an abortion after 24 weeks if the mother's health is at mortal risk.
  
  i 100 percent support the new law. doctors have been persecuted in the past for saving people's lives by aborting after 24 weeks, and this law ensures that the mother's well being and safety is taken seriously.
  "

   Winter spam. W for wind. Ever had times where you went out and it is super windy? With the wind making it worse. Do you try to avoid this?

  it's normally fairly windy where i live as it is, and the wind factor around my office building is absolutely ridiculous.
  
  there's really no way to avoid the wind, so i usually just endure it.
  "
414807,"
   N for nature. What does it look like for where you live in the winter time?

  it's normally gray and very windy, and occasionally we get snowstorms where we get anywhere between 3-24 inches of snow, depending on how severe the storm is.
  "
414808,"
   I for ice. How do you feel about icy conditions?

  they absolutely terrify me because i'm always forced to drive in icy weather. this past monday was really icy, it dropped down to 8 degrees fahrenheit during the day, which made for slippery roads because it had rained the previous day.
  "
414809,"
   T for time. When does it get dark for you?

  around 4:45-5:00pm these days. i can't wait until the spring, when i can actually drive home from work in daylight instead of pitch darkness.
  "
414810,"
   Are we all have a fun Wednesday?
  ","
  my wednesday wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't great either. i couldn't get out of bed on time this morning, but i still ended up arriving to work before 9am, which was a relief.
  
  work dragged, but i had a good lunch with my coworkers, which broke the day up nicely. i've only been home for about an hour, and i'm planning on doing absolutely nothing tonight.
  "
414811,"
   Is there anything about your physical appearance you want to change?
  ","
  yes, i wish i had a more defined jawline, since i absolutely hate how i look when you view me from the side. i wish i was skinnier as well.
  "
414812,"
   How can you improve your hygiene?
  ","
  to improve my hygiene, perhaps i could brush my teeth twice per day instead of once per day and floss more often. other than that, my hygiene is pretty well-managed. i'm so paranoid about looking dirty or smelling bad, so i always make sure that my hair looks clean and that i have some sort of pleasant scent on.
  "
414813,"
   Do you always know how to describe the taste of your food? Would you be able to if you ate something new and different?
  ","
  it's difficult for me to describe the taste of food, especially verbally as i've always had a hard time expressing my thoughts and feelings verbally.
  
  i'm not really all that interested in food to begin with, so it also has never been something that has occurred to me.
  "
414814,"
   Would say January has been a great month so far for you?
  ","
  january has flown by, honestly. i don't recall much of what i've done in january at all -- all i've been doing is working, and occasionally seeing a friend or two and my boyfriend on a regular basis.
  
  however, this past monday was a wonderful day & it was the most fun i've had in a really long time. my boyfriend and his friends and i all got together, and we ended up playing video games and poker together until 2am.
  "
414815,"
   What do you like to do? What makes you who you are?
  ","
  my hobbies include writing, reading, browsing the internet (lol), playing video games, watching television shows & documentaries, hanging out with friends, and painting.
  
  i don't know if these hobbies make me who i am, although they are a large part of who i am. and it's easier for me to identify with material objects and interests as opposed to ideas and personality traits.
  "
414816,"
   When is the last time you isolated yourself? 


That sounded dirty to me...
  ","
  LOL.
  
  the last time i isolated myself was tonight, actually. i'm currently shut away in my room, drinking coffee and listening to music and drowning out the sounds of my household. i don't want to bother with anyone, i just want to be left alone in the quietness.
  "
414817,"
   Will you ever stop seeking new adventures?
  ","
  i certainly hope not. i'm not quite as adventurous as i used to be, but i still have a passion for seeking new experiences as they help me learn and evolve as a human.
  "
414818,"
   Why are you so hard on yourself?
  ","
  i'm hard on myself because i know i can do better than how i'm currently doing. i can work harder than how i'm currently working. i can put more effort into my appearance, i can take more time looking after my health, and i can be more productive if i sacrificed a few things in my life.
  
  i'm hard on myself because i deserve to be hard on myself, because you cannot improve without looking at yourself critically.
  "
414819,"
   Why do you want to transition to vegetarian eventually?
  ","
  i believe it would help me eat healthier food, and i rarely eat meat products to begin with as it is. i already transitioned to black bean & veggie burgers instead of beef burgers.
  "
414820,"
   Do you stay positive in bad circumstances?
  ","
  not generally, no. i have the tendency to be rather pessimistic, especially in light of terrible circumstances. i always expect the worst to happen, and when something bad does happen, i become very overwhelmed.
  "
414821,"
   Do you eat meat?
  ","
  yes, i eat meat occasionally. i'm not vegetarian or vegan, although i would like to transition to vegetarianism eventually.
  "
414822,"
   What was the last thing you succeed at?
  ","
  i surpassed my expected number of completed assignments this morning, which was a pleasant surprise and made me proud of myself. i was expecting to complete between 7-8 at the most, but i managed to write 11 narratives within four hours.
  "
414823,"
   Are you infatuated with power? What is power to you? Are you powerful?
  ","
  i have no interest in obtaining power, and i'm not a powerful person by any means. i know how to be a leader when it's warranted, but it isn't a position i'm comfortable being in sometimes because i'm afraid of ab*sing my power & privilege.
  "
414824,"
   Are you a patient person? Or does it vary depending on the circumstances?
  ","
  most of the time, i'm a very patient person. i'm willing to work with other people and give them the benefit of the doubt if they're learning something new or don't understand a concept or action.
  
  however, sometimes i can be rather impatient. it mostly happens with myself because my mind works faster than my body can handle, and often i become frustrated with myself because i'm not moving as fast or as efficiently as i want to be.
  "
414825,"
   Are you more honest to yourself or to others?
  ","
  i'm more honest to others than i am to myself. it's difficult for me to be honest with myself with certain subjects because the truth can be hard to swallow.
  "
414826,"
   What do you think is the most common complaint people in your country have?
  ","
  i don't know about the country as a whole, but the most common complaint in my region is that rent and mortgages are extremely expensive. it's difficult for people to live independently because an average ranch-styled home is $500k on average, and rent for a one-bedroom apartment varies between $1.2k and $1.5k.
  "
414827,"
   If your young child wanted to be transgender, would you allow them to go on hormones and transition?
  ","
  i can't really make that determination at the moment because i simply don't know how puberty blockers & hormones will be 5-10 years down the line. as they are now, puberty blockers are mostly detrimental to a child's development so there is a lot of controversy regarding giving children under the age of 16-18 hormones. i would be hesitant to say yes because i don't know how it would affect their health, but obviously i would be 100 percent supportive of their need to transition.
  "
414828,"
   How many chances do you need? / When was the last time you've got another chance?
  ","
  i've been given a lot more chances that i realistically shouldn't have been given in the first place. i have a tendency to screw up a lot, act selfishly, become distant, etc etc. my boyfriend knows how to call out my behavior when it warrants correction, but he has also given me a lot of second, third, and fourth chances when i really didn't deserve them.
  "
414829,"
   Will you be playing lis 2 new episode tomorrow?
  ","
  AH, YES. well -- maybe not tomorrow, but definitely over the weekend. :'))
  "
414830,"
   In your opinion what keeps the spark alive in a relationship?
  ","
  i believe it varies from relationship to relationship, since everyone has different qualities which are attractive to their partner.
  
  personally speaking, what has kept the spark alive in my relationship is our ability to have genuine fun together, where we can sit down and talk & joke around and laugh until tears are rolling down our faces.
  
  we also go out together occasionally, where we'll either go bowling or go to a brewery, etc etc. making memories and experiencing is what keeps my relationship alive, and we've become not only partners but also best friends.
  "
414831,"
   Do you think white lies are bad?
  ","
  it depends on the lie itself, since it's difficult to give a blanket statement regarding *all* white lies since they all range in subject and severity.

  "
414834,"
   What kind of games do you play?
  ","
  i play video games on the xbox one, and most of the games i play are first person shooters or open world RPGs.
  
  my favorite game atm is fallout 76, but i also love the rest of the fallout series, the elder scrolls series, the assassin's creed series, the tomb raider series, the bioshock collection, life is strange, the wolf among us, the walking dead, etc etc.
  "
414835,"
   What would you love to create?
  ","
  ideally, i would love to create a novel or a book of short stories & poetry. it's something that has always been a goal of mine ever since i was a teenager. within the past year, i have been writing more frequently, which i believe is a step in the right direction.
  "
414836,"
   Where have you been stuck?
  ","
  most recently, i was stuck in traffic. LOL. it took me nearly an hour to get home from work today.
  
  however, in a more metaphorical sense, i was stuck when i graduated from college & had no idea what profession i wanted to pursue. i ended up working retail for an additional year after graduating because i didn't know what sort of career i wanted, and eventually i began looking for jobs that had to do with writing and editing.
  "
414837,"
   When you shouldn't wait?
  ","
  you shouldn't wait to take an opportunity that may present itself in rare, or once-in-a-lifetime, occasions. our lives on this earth are short and fleeting, and we should take advantage of unique opportunities that provide growth, fun, and experience.
  "
414838,"
   Where would you look for heaven?/How do you imagine a day in heaven?
  ","
  i don't believe in heaven. however, for the sake of answering this question, i'll pretend that it exists to me.
  
  if i were to (somehow) go to heaven, it would probably be filled with things that bring me peace, people who enriched my life prior to their passing, and a general sense of tranquility and well being.
  "
414839,"
   What stunned you?
  ","
  i was stunned when i saw linkin park perform live in concert for the first time. i ended up sobbing towards the end of the show because of how moving it was. i've seen them at least 3 times in concert since then, and every show was magical, fantastic, and heartfelt.
  "
414840,"
   What do you think about too friendly people? Do those exist?
  ","
  yeah, i believe that there are some people out there who are *too* friendly -- to the point where their kindness is often taken advantage of and they become hurt as a result. in some cases, people who are too friendly don't know how to say ""no,"" which results in them getting stuck in awkward situations.
  "
414841,"

  peppermint, lavender, sage, yellow and pink roses, and sunflowers.

  "
414850,"
   When you're sad, what do you do?

  honestly, i usually just try to sleep it off these days. when i'm sad, it normally turns into depression where i have no motivation or will to live, so i wind up sleeping all day.

   Good ways to get girls to notice you more
  ","
  just be yourself & the right person will come along. you shouldn't feel then need to be something you're not in order to attract a person's attention, and if that happens, then they've become attracted to a version of you that's a facade, which isn't healthy.
  
  just continue living your life to the best of your ability and remain true to yourself.

  ","
  gender dysphoria is in the DSM-V but it isn't classified as a disorder in itself, which is why they changed it from ""gender identity disorder"" to ""gender dysphoria.""
  
  the new name seeks to remove the stigma associated with the condition and provide greater understanding, although a lot of people in the trans community think it should be declassified entirely.

414993,"
   Do you think falling in love with someone’s personality will automatically make their looks more attractive to you?
  ","
  i definitely think so. you start to appreciate their physical qualities and notice things you didn't notice before.
  
  same concept as when you either fall out of love with someone or don't like someone anymore. sometimes they become less physically attractive.

   What do you class as an interesting and an uninteresting fact about yourself? Stuck about what is interesting fact about myself
  ","
  i think an interesting fact would perhaps be something that people wouldn't expect about you, or maybe it's a controversial opinion that you hold or something that's relatively uncommon.
  
  whereas an uninteresting fact would be something that's commonplace and boring.
  "
415005,"

  -- i have a boyfriend, with whom i've been in a relationship for nearly 10 years.
  
  -- i currently have blue hair & half my head is shaved.
  
  -- my favorite genres of music are alternative rock, nu metal, hip hop, and instrumentals (video game/movie soundtracks).
  "
415006,"
   is it normal/ok to miss old relationships if you are currently happy in relationship?
  ","
  i think it's normal, but i also don't believe that it's okay. if you're missing a past relationship, then you're clearly not entirely happy with your current relationship. if you were happy then you wouldn't have a reason to miss an old relationship at all.
  "
415007,"
   Do you apologize for things that are not your fault to keep the peace?
  ","
  i used to in the past, but not anymore. i'm not going to take responsibility or blame for something that wasn't my fault because i don't want to give that person the satisfaction of knowing that they can control me.
  "
415008,"
   Are you hard on yourself l or you often give yourself credit?
  ","
  i'm normally incredibly hard on myself because it's the only way i can keep myself motivated. it's great if i accomplish something, but in what ways can i make it better ?? i'm not at the top of my game, and there are always methods for improvement.
  "
415009,"
   if someone says something negative about the LGBTQ community, will you voice your opinion and confront them?
  ","
  probably not, unless they were directly speaking to me about it. i'm not going to come out of the woodworks to a complete stranger and tell them my opinion on the lgbtq+ community.
  "
415010,"
   Which do you like more your bf’s look or personality?
  ","
  i like them both equally. he's very attractive to me, but his personality is what has kept us together for so long. he's such a humorous, understanding, hard-working, and creative person, and i've always admired him over the years.
  "
415011,"
   When is it acceptable to voice your judgement?
  ","
  it's acceptable to voice judgment when the person you're speaking with asks for your opinion. i believe it's unacceptable (in most cases) to judge something or voice your opinions on things if someone isn't explicitly asking, unless that person is in danger or something similar.
  "
415012,"
   Do you consider yourself to be a strong person? Why or why not?
  ","
  i never used to think i was strong, but over the course of many years and through attending a lot of therapy sessions, i've realized my strength.
  
  i endured a lot of things growing up, and although i have struggled -- and continue to struggle -- enduring those circumstances have only been a testament to my strength because i've managed to not succumb to my past and i've tried to live a successful life in spite of my mental health bringing me down.
  "
415013,"
   Tell me something interesting about yourself?
  ","
  when i was a child, i used to read the dictionary for fun.

415014,"

  i'm not hypocritical, as far as i'm aware.
  "
415015,"
   psychiatrists never talk to me enough to diagnose me, they only talk about my meds and im not sure kf thats normal? we only meet for like 10 mins at most
  ","
  that's normal, but not all psychiatrists are like that. there's one psychiatrist in the office i go to who only sees patients for 10-15 minutes at most just to refill medication, and i've never personally been a fan of that.
  
  you might be better off trying to find a different psychiatrist, especially if you want to discuss diagnoses and get to the root of your mental health instead of just being on medication for your current symptoms. there *are* psychiatrists out there who are willing to work with you on that, you just have to find them.
  "
415016,"
   Besides your country, which is the next best country in the world?

   What’s the highest temperature in your region in summer? Does it get hot?

  it's normal for temperatures to hover in the 80s (fahrenheit), but it's gotten into the 90s before as well.
  "
415018,"
   Does coffee keep you awake?
  ","
  sometimes, it does !! i've noticed that it wakes me up in the morning, but it relaxes me in the evening. i can easily go to bed after drinking a cup of coffee & it won't affect me, lol.
  "
415019,"
   did u have an idea that u had bpd before u got diagnosed? and who diagnosed u?
  ","
  yeah, i thought i had BPD prior to my diagnosis because i had done a lot of research online regarding different mental illnesses and everything about BPD resonated with me on a very deep level. originally, i thought i had depersonalization/derealization disorder, but over the course of many years, BPD stood out more because it touched upon everything from my emotions to my behavior.
  
  i was diagnosed by my former psychiatrist (she since retired) after seeing her for almost a year. i miss her a lot, because she allowed me to talk about my feelings and my past and we discussed how my upbringing influenced my current behavioral trends. the psychiatrist i have now isn't so great and i've been thinking about finding a new one.

  ","
  i used to ride the bus in the mornings & then walk home from school in the afternoons.
  "
415022,"
   What would your dream date be like?
  ","
  i'm relatively easy-going, so i've never had a ""dream date"" -- any time that i spend with my boyfriend is time that i cherish, and our dates in the past have ranged from going out to dinner and the movies, to walking around and taking photos in the park, to taking a spontaneous road trip.
  "
415023,"
   What does Catch 22 mean?
  ","
  a catch 22 is a situation in which there is no logical escape due to conflicting or contradictory circumstances or rules.
  
  i.e. the whole idea of ""you have to have money in order to make money"" is a catch 22, because if you don't have money in the first place, it's difficult to make money since you don't have the money required to make that money in the first place.
  "
415024,"
   What's your favorite thing to do when it's raining outside? Hugs

  cuddle up with my boyfriend while watching a movie or watching him play video games, while drinking coffee or tea.
  "
415025,"
   Do you believe everyone is beautiful?
  ","
  no, not at all. there are a lot of people i don't find attractive, and there are also people who have ugly personalities as well.
  "
415026,"
   why like someone like Chester Bennington who ended his life? Same with Kurt Cobain. They get all this admiration and stuff but ended their lives leaving devastation. Not good role models
  ","
  i already explained why chester was a big influence in my life (unless you didn't see that post). even though he passed away, he still had an enormous influence on my life and taught me how to cope with what i was enduring in the past. his struggle with his own demons made me feel less alone at the time, and just because he completed s*icide doesn't mean he wasn't a good role model for me.
  "
415027,"
   Not to sound bogus cause I am trying to understand because I feel I am bipolar just never had a true diagnosis but is it possible that I can get diagnosed, have it acknowledged and learn skills of coping so I’m not dependent on medications??

   Diff. anon but was wondering: Have you ever cut ties with anyone because you were scared of hurting them? I have read many people with diagnosed BDP say they've felt this way.

   What's the difference between emotions and feelings?

  according to the reliable internet, apparently the distinct difference between emotions & feelings is that emotions are event-driven, while feelings are learned behaviors that are triggered by an external event.

   Can we become friends ?
  ","
  friendship doesn't happen upon request. it normally happens naturally, not by a person asking someone else ""can we become friends?"" or anything.

  it depends on my mood !! sometimes i use french vanilla creamer, while other times i take it with one scoop of stevia and a splash of half-n-half (although lately i've been using sweet cream).
  
  as for tea, i usually drink different flavored green teas, but when i drink english breakfast or earl grey tea, i like one scoop of sugar and a small splash of milk.

  ","
  THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY. this week went horridly slow, and i'm looking forward to staying home for two days straight, lmao (with the exception of seeing my boyfriend tomorrow night).
  
  my only plans are to drink a lot of coffee, do laundry, finish my freelance assignments, and finish my personal essay.
  "
415072,"
   What is your best question to get to know someone?
  ","
  when i want to get to know someone, i ask them what their passions and ambitions are. you can learn a lot about a person by noticing what they're passionate about and what they want to succeed at in their life.
  "
415073,"
   What are you looking forward to about this year the most?
  ","
  there isn't anything i'm really looking forward to because i don't have anything planned in the future.

  ","
  i only ever drank it as a child, and i don't remember if i liked the taste or not.
  "
415075,"
   Do you prefer Twitter or Facebook?
  ","
  facebook, solely because i get most of my memes from there and people interact with me more on facebook compared to twitter. twitter is good for my random thoughts, but hardly anyone follows me and only close friends like my tweets.

  hello -- do you have a question ??
  "
415077,"
   When did you last do art ? X

  i'm assuming you mean painting, drawing, etc etc. if so, then i honestly can't remember the last time i painted or drew. it's been months.
  "
415078,"
   What is your definition of honesty?
  ","
  honesty is the ability to be forthright and sincere with both yourself and those around you, lacking fabrications.
  "
415079,"
   What does respect mean to you?
  ","
  respect is having admiration or appreciation of an individual due to the content of their character, their positive attributes, their contributions to their community, and/or their opinions.
  "
415080,"
   How would you describe yourself?
  ","
  at my worst, i'm impulsive, self-sabotaging, keen to giving into my compulsions, and bitter.
  
  at my best, i'm creative, compassionate, open-minded, and empathetic.
  "
415081,"
   Have you ever been stuck in a situation where you had to be around someone you dislike?What happened?
  ","
  yes, it happens quite often to me, unfortunately. usually it had to do with work where i would have no choice but to work with a person i didn't like, but i would obviously remain civil with them in order to be more efficient.

415082,"
   May I mention something?
  ","
  well, yeah. you're anonymous so it's not as if you have anything to lose.
  "
415083,"
   What makes you happy?

  my boyfriend's smile and laughter, spending time with my boyfriend, relaxing with a cup of coffee after work, having my first cigarette of the day, catching up with friends over a few drinks, having a productive day at work, writing something i'm proud of, smelling snow in the air, having a bonfire with friends, and lighting candles.
  "
415084,"
   Do you prefer the park or the beach?
  ","
  i prefer the park over the beach. i dislike the beach most of the time, it's too hot and i don't like going into the water anyway. the only reason why i would go to the beach is to drink beer and get a suntan.
  
  the park, on the other hand, is one of my favorite places. there are so many parks in my region and they're all beautiful. i used to bring my camera and take a lot of photos of nature.
  "
415085,"
   its more important now than ever. currently the US government is shut down, and airports are working with less and less TSA security, among other looming disasters.
  ","
  i wholeheartedly agree. also, apparently the government isn't doing as many inspections on food items due to the shutdown, so we have to be extra cautious about the food we buy.
  "
415086,"
   Are you short tempered?
  ","
  no, quite the opposite actually. i have a lot of patience and nothing really pushes me to anger unless a person attacks a close friend of mine or my boyfriend.

415087,"
   When did you last cry?
  ","
  last week, i believe. i don't remember the reason why, although sometimes it happens without real reason.

  i'm interested in politics, but i'm definitely not an invested in it as i was in the past. i like to remain up to date, though.
  "
415089,"
   Have you ever run away from school lessons?
  ","
  i never skipped classes when i was in high school, but i skipped classes occasionally when i was in college. most of the time, it was because i had assignments and papers to finish and didn't have enough time during the day to complete them.

  "
415093,"
   Do you trust people easily
  ","
  no, i don't trust people easily at all. i'm very hesitant to trust people and i don't trust others until they prove their loyalty to me or give me a reason to trust them.
  "
415094,"
   Do you like music?
  ","
  yes, i'm quite passionate about music. music has helped me when no one else was there to support me, and it makes me feel utterly alive.

  "
415099,"
   How's work going?

   Why do you like Chester Bennington so much?

  his impact upon my life was so great when i was a teenager that i owe my life to him. i struggled through a lot when i was much younger, and linkin park's music and his writing and perspectives on things really inspired me to keep holding on. he fueled my creativity and allowed me to write out my feelings instead of keeping them within it. it kept me sane.

  i enjoy pizza sometimes, sure. i usually have a grandma or margherita slice.
  "
415185,"
   Are you online often?
  ","
  i feel like this is a strange question to ask, considering how these days, everyone owns a smartphone -- so technically speaking, everyone is *always* online, it's just a matter of whether or not someone is looking at their phone.
  "
415186,"
   Do you play any instruments?

  no, i don't play any instruments currently. when i was a teenager, i enjoyed playing the guitar and the keyboards, and i even owned a ukulele for a brief period of time. but i haven't been interested in creating music in years.

  tbh pride isn't really something i've ever wanted to attend. i like looking at people's pictures, but walking around in a crowd full of people makes me extremely anxious, so i don't think i would enjoy it.

415217,"
   Are tattoos addictive?
  ","
  not in the literal sense of addiction, but generally speaking, yes -- they can be addictive depending on your personality. for people like me, once you get one tattoo, it's difficult to see yourself with *only* one tattoo, so you start planning more and more.
  "
415218,"

  they ranged anywhere from $100-500 each, but that's because they're all different sizes and i've gone to four separate tattoo artists to get them done.

  as i mentioned earlier, i have seven tattoos. they're on my shoulder blades, my upper arm and forearm, my ribcage, my thigh, the back of my calf, and my ankle.

   Would you ever adopt kitty cats or puppies?

  yes, in a heartbeat. when i move into my own house/apartment, i'm adopting an animal. although tbh i would probably be more inclined to adopt an older dog because there are so many older dogs left in shelters waiting to be adopted.

  i can't remember the last time i actually hugged a tree, if i ever have at all.
  "
415234,"
   Are you a loyal person?

  yes, i'm an immensely loyal person. i don't make friends very easily, but i'm loyal to the ones i do have. i think loyalty is one of the most important things you can contribute to any form of relationship.

  "
415239,"

  i usually buy the big jugs of starbucks black iced coffee & make it my own way -- usually with three pumps of vanilla sweetener and a splash of cream.
  
  as for hot coffee, it depends on my mood. sometimes i take it with a scoop of stevia and cream, while other times i prefer it without sweetener at all.
  "
415243,"
   Why are you twisting words instead of admitting your are wrong? Such a white entitled thing to do. It was never just about doctorates. Your own words ""thousands of people of color who are immensely successful with medical degrees, doctorates, etc""
  ","
  uh, i did admit i was wrong -- it was the second question in this thread where an anon mentioned it was probably millions & i said ""that's probably more accurate.""
  
  this entire thread was about success pertaining to doctorates, so idk where you got the assumption from that there was an underlying issue there.

  no, i'm not a hugger at all. i only hug my boyfriend and my best friend.

  as far as i'm aware, no one that i talk to from askfm is transphobic.

415247,"
   can you be friends with someone who hates trans?
  ","
  no. that's transphobic, and i wouldn't want to be friends with someone who's transphobic.
  "
415248,"
   what if their wrong or mean
  ","
  well i wouldn't be civil with a person if they were intentionally being mean to me. i would just cut them out of my life in that situation.
  
  i also think there's a difference between being wrong and simply having a different opinion. you aren't necessarily wrong if your opinion differs from someone else's, but there are some opinions which *are* based on false information, which would make them wrong.
  "
415249,"
   Would change if someone told you “you are rude”?
  ","
  depends on a variety of factors, i.e. who's telling me i'm rude, the tone of their voice, what we're talking about, etc etc. it would be different with every scenario.
  "
415250,"
   Can you be civil with someone who has different views with you?

  well yeah, that's part of being a civilized adult. as long as you respect each other's opinion, even if you don't necessarily agree with them, then that's all you can do.

   gillette has come under fire after releasing a commercial that draws on the #metoo movement to challenge ""toxic masculinity,"" urging men to be better. it covers bullying, sxxual harassment, and toxic male stereotypes. many people are claiming the commercial demonizes men. what are your thoughts?
  ","
  all right, so i just watched the commercial.
  
  to my understanding, the commercial doesn't demonize men at all. it's simply bringing to light the injustices that have been done upon other people by men, creating this culture of toxic masculinity that exists today. it doesn't say *all* men do this, which is exemplified by the fact that there were men who were breaking up fights, stopping their friends from chasing after girls, etc etc.
  
  it's setting a good example for younger boys and young adults to open their eyes as to what acceptable versus unacceptable behavior is. ""boys will be boys"" is not an acceptable phrase to use anymore because there should be no excuse for violence or harassment, and those behaviors need to be corrected.
  
  there's so much pressure on men to act and behave a certain way that gillette is trying to break that pressure and point out that certain things are *not* okay, and we should educate the future generations accordingly.
  "
415252,"
   What do you all think about the coins and the wallet thing seeing whose on top in your country or friends list? Hugs

  sometimes i feel as if askfm is implementing these changes in an attempt to start competition between users, lmao.
  
  first they revealed how many followers everyone had, and now they're posting up how many coins people have and stacking users against each other, both within their friends list and within their countries.
  
  seems like some sort of marketing tool to make people answer more questions & be more active on the site.
  "
415253,"
   How would you deal with a friend who’s racist? I really enjoy the company but their racist remarks towards others make me uncomfortable. Could a person a change? I tried talking to them but they still make their remarks

  if my friend turned out to be racist and continuously made racist remarks without attempting to understand why their thoughts/behavior is wrong, then i wouldn't be their friend anymore.
  "
415254,"
   What's fake to you?
  ","
  to me personally, being fake is when a person isn't being their genuine, true self. whether that's because they're putting on a facade in front of other people or they're in a state of denial about who they truly are.

   I never liked driving either, during the short time I did while I was (unsuccessfully) learning. Most people I know found that unusual, as my friends all seemed to like it. People often saw it as strange, and a disadvantage, that I didn’t. Is there a stigma about not driving/not liking it in the US?
  ","
  there's somewhat of a stigma, but it only really applies to places outside of big cities (i.e. boston, new york city, los angeles) where it's difficult to get somewhere if you don't drive. where i live, you pretty much *need* to drive everywhere, or else you'll wind up spending too much money on taxis and ubers and trains.
  
  in bigger cities, there's less of a need for driving because everything is basically in walking distance or there are subways and buses.

415269,"
   Do I have to spell it out? Fuk you white ppl are amazing. In the world you only said ""thousands"" implying not many at all. If you can't see that I give up.

  i can see how you would think that if you were to compare it to a global scale, but obviously i didn't mean ""not many at all"" considering the context it was in.
  
  also, i don't even know how many people even have a doctorate -- regardless of race. i don't personally know anyone who has a doctorate (even my personal doctor doesn't have an MD), so i don't really think saying ""thousands"" instead of ""millions"" isn't a big stretch.

   What social stigma does society need to get over? :3 (mini spam, staif) <3
  ","
  society needs to get over the stigma associated with having a complex mental illness, i.e. personality disorders, dissociative disorders, psychotic disorders, etc etc. due to misunderstanding of mental health in the past and the perpetration of stigma carried out by the media, people with complex mental disorders are often viewed as dangerous, manipulative, attention-seeking, and weak.
  
  in reality, people with those illnesses are often more of a danger to themselves than other people.

  technically speaking, my mental illnesses make me ""crazy.""
  
  tbh i don't really like the use of that word at all -- it only adds to the stigma associated with mental illnesses, especially with respect to disorders that include psychosis. there's such a bad connotation when it comes to the term ""crazy"" and it's been harmful toward people who struggle with their mental health.

   In the show Dexter & the movie Split, psychiatrists says that they believe that people with ASPD & DID are more evolved than people without & that people with DID are nearly supernatural. What's your opinion on this? Is it wrong to glamourize the result of trauma? Do you agree with their opinions?
  ","
  there's nothing supernatural or evolutionary about having a severe mental illness. having disorders such as ASPD and DID simply mean that you've been subjected to intense, prolong abuse from a very young age to the point where you've developed a longstanding personality disorder (ASPD) or a fracturing identity in an effort to protect yourself (DID).
  
  i've never seen either dexter or split, but i've heard that split was incredibly ableist and demonized people with DID by portraying them as these violent creatures, when in reality, people with DID and other severe disorders are more of a threat to themselves than other people.

415386,"
   Whats important for you and why?
  ","
  my boyfriend is important to me -- he's perhaps one of the most important things in my life, besides my career. writing is also extremely important to me, as well as coffee, my friends, music, video games, my mental health, and video games.
  "

   How often will you wear something before you wash it?Example a pair of jeans or a coat?
  ","
  i wash my hoodies, tee shirts, blouses, and other shirts after wearing it only once. i wash my jeans after wearing them perhaps three or four times (although four is kinda pushing it). i hardly ever wash coats, though.
  "
415388,"
   On what you would spend all your money?
  ","
  if i had the option, i would choose not to spend money at all, lol. however, i prefer spending money on experiences as opposed to material items, such as vacations, concerts, tattoos, etc etc.
  "

   How to /almost never/ forget?
  ","
  considering i have a terrible memory, i've found that writing things down and taking photographs are great ways of remembering events, people, etc etc. i used to keep a journal, and i always take photos whenever i'm out because i like cherishing the memories i create with my friends and boyfriend.
  "
415392,"
   What do you think others think of you? Do you care?
  ","
  i don't really know what other people think of me because i've never cared to ask, sans obvious people such as my boyfriend. i would hope that most people would think of me as a compassionate, knowledgeable individual, but i'm 100 percent positive that there are also plenty of people who hate me.

  no, i've never heard of that before.
  "
415394,"
   Can you manipulate? What do you think of manipulation?
  ","
  i've unfortunately manipulated people in the past, and i was horribly good at it too. i regret those decisions because i'm sure i hurt a lot of people, but at the time, i simply didn't care.
  
  manipulation is a terrible thing to do to a person and it's a form of emotional abvse, especially if you do it to a friend or partner.
  "
415395,"
   What would you draw or write with coloured chalk if a lot people would see it afterwards?
  ","
  i would write ""if you're going through hell, keep going.""

415396,"
   Who and why you want to meet?
  ","
  i met chester bennington once when i was 11/12 years old. however, i wish i could have met him again before he passed away. he was such a profound influence on me during my teenage years, and if it wasn't for him and his music, i likely wouldn't be alive today. i would thank him for all he's done for me over the years.
  "
415397,"
   What kind of colors would describe your current mood?
  ","
  i suppose green. i have a candle lit that's currently green and it smells like clover, moss, and pipe tobacco (it's supposed to resemble the shire). it calms me down.

415398,"
   If you could have the choice of seeing in the future or the choice of changing something like a regret into something better which would you choose? Hugs
  ","
  i wouldn't want to see into the future. that would probably give me too much anxiety, and i would rather live my life in the present moment as opposed to constantly thinking about the future.
  
  in that respect, i would rather change a former regret into something better.
  "
415399,"
   If you could read anyone's mind who would it be and why? Hugs

  i don't think i would want to read anyone's mind tbh. people don't say everything they think for a reason, and it would make me too paranoid if i knew everything that someone was thinking.

  we usually just serve them as is, but we like to put a variety of ingredients inside of them so they taste yummy. like garlic potatoes, cheese, chopped meat, and tuna. not all in the same ones obviously but we'll mix the potatoes and meat in one empanada.

  "
415427,"
   ?are you where you want to be in life?
  ","
  not really, no. ideally, i would love to be living on my own or with my boyfriend, making money through freelance writing (although i don't mind my job at all), and caring for a bunch of pets.
  "
415428,"
   ?what do you think has changed about you since you have grown up?
  ","
  i've learned to be more mindful and live in the present moment instead of focusing too much on the past or the future. i've learned to be more grateful and express my appreciation for my boyfriend and close friends, and i've also learned that it's important to take time for yourself.
  "
415429,"
   ?where is your favorite place to go grocery shopping? what’s on your shopping list?
  ","
  i like shopping at stop & shop. they have a lot of all natural, organic foods that are generally low in price. my mother controls the food that comes into the house, so it's usually obvious things like milk, bread, and eggs, as well as k cups, chopped meat, pork, veggie burgers, frozen french fries, veggie chips and straws, oatmeal, pasta, etc etc.

  ","
  i never wanted to be a parent when i was younger because i disliked children. even these days, i'm still unsure of whether or not i want to be a parent.
  
  i would foster or adopt a child if i decide i wanted children and, for some reason, couldn't have any. there are a lot of older children and teenagers in the system who deserve a loving home.
  "
415435,"
   ?what news channel do you prefer?
  ","
  there's a local news channel for my region, which usually has a lot of local news as well as national/global news. however, i generally don't watch the news -- i usually read articles on google news to get my information.
  "
415436,"
   ?have you ever crashed a vehicle?

  "
415437,"
   ?what do you plan on using your tax return for?
  ","
  i don't know if i'll even get much back this year for my taxes -- i was doing a lot of freelance work for a while which is untaxed per week & you pay back on taxes at the end of the year, so i wouldn't be surprised if i end up owing the IRS money.

  "
415440,"
   ?do you miss being a child/teenager?
  ","
  i don't remember my childhood. however, i don't miss being a teenager at all. my memories of being a teenager are nothing but bad memories, and i was severely depressed & svicidal most of the time.
  "
415441,"
   ?what errand/chore do you hate the most?
  ","
  i absolutely hate cleaning the bathroom. our bathroom is small, thankfully, but i use a cleaner mixed with bleach and the smell makes me so dizzy because of the fact that my bathroom is so small and we don't have ventilation in there.
  "
415442,"
   ?what do you really want to be known for?
  ","
  i want to be known for my writing, overall. i've been trying to write more in an attempt to get my name out there once i'm happy with what i've written, because you simply can't get published if you don't perfect your craft.
  "
415443,"
   ? thoughts on gas prices right now?

  my student loans. it's my most expensive bill.

  yeah, the area i live in frequently experiences nor'easters. it's generally a really bad snow storm where there's high winds, zero visibility, and anywhere between 6-24 inches of snow (if not more). we've had state of emergencies declared before as a result.

  my sunday has been going well so far. i've done really nothing besides drink coffee, listen to music, and work on some writing.
  "
415457,"
   Should Religion be banned?
  ","
  no. although religion has its flaws and brings out the worst in people at times, it's also a coping mechanism for others and that shouldn't be taken away from them.
  "
415458,"
   What is something everyone else seems to like that you just can't get yourself into?
  ","
  i'm not sure. i don't really know what everyone else likes at the moment, especially considering groups of people are interested in things in phases. i don't care enough to follow those trends.
  "
415459,"
   Do people on ask affect your mood?
  ","
  generally, no. however, i am friends with a few people from askfm so when they write me with either accomplishments or struggles, then i totally empathize with them & that affects my mood.
  "
415460,"
   What do you do when someone doesn’t care about your feelings?
  ","
  there isn't much i can do in that circumstance, so i just move on. you can't expect everyone to care about you or your feelings, and if someone simply doesn't care, then they're not important enough to be in your life at all.
  "
415461,"
   Did you enjoy your weekend?
  ","
  i haven't done much this weekend at all, and it's not even noon on sunday yet. yesterday, i spent most of my time sleeping and i played video games for a few hours.
  
  this morning has been more productive -- alongside drinking coffee, listening to music, and answering questions on askfm, i've also been writing. :'))
  "
415462,"
   Have you ever fought over a guy?
  ","
  i don't believe i've ever fought someone over a guy, no. when i was in high school, i generally liked people who didn't reciprocate those feelings, so it was never an issue that came up.
  "
415463,"
   Do you enjoy philosophical questions?
  ","
  sometimes, but it ultimately depends on my mood. i'm more tolerant some days to philosophical questions than other days. at the moment, i really don't feel like crunching my brain to answer philosophical questions, though.
  "
415464,"
   What do you normally eat for breakfast?

   this isn't the same person but i actually answered a really similar question to this one in my online school a year or so ago. most of us said yes or were neutral like you but one of my closest friends said something along the lines of most likely not, because regardless of hitler, the ""seeds"" --
  ","
  (cont) of oppression have already been planted and have been growing for centuries, regardless of him, and the further back in history you go, generally the less open to change people are. unlike a good portion of the world today, most of those people unfortunately grew up with oppressive beliefs and to suggest otherwise would be ludicrous. if hitler fought for justice as opposed to oppression, he may not have even been elected as president because we are all so afraid of change and so stuck on punishment that we choose to go with punishable sameness than justified change. also, even if hitler did end up becoming president, the rest of the world most likely would not agree with their version of building the country back up. world war ii could very well be the war on equality as opposed to the war on jews. it was obviously much well said than this but it's always stuck with me. it really makes you think.
  
  --
  
  wow, thank you so much for sending this in !! that really does make you think and your friend's thoughts are absolutely true to a degree. i never thought about it that way before.

  "
415467,"
   In what ways do you think the school system needs to be reformed, if at all, and why?
  ","
  i answered a question similar to this yesterday, i believe.
  
  in short, i think there should be more push for better sex education in schools regarding sex itself, the idea of consent, birth control, infertility, STDs/STIs, etc etc. i also believe that schools should introduce a mental wellness class that discusses depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, including how to effectively cope with negative feelings and reach out for help when you need it.
  "
415468,"
   Do you like Korn?Whats your favorite song by them?

  korn is one of my favorite bands, actually !! i like their ""issues"" album overall, but my favorite song by them might be ""falling away from me.""

415469,"
   Given how influential Hitler was, for not only Germany but the world, how do you think the world may have been different had he not had the beliefs that he did -- for example, if he fought for justice, as opposed to oppression? Do you think the world would be as discriminative today?
  ","
  that's a difficult question to answer, considering how influential hitler was when it came to antisemitism and the outcome of world war II as a whole. there's such a domino effect when talking about hitler's regime that it's almost impossible to really fathom how the world would be if he either did not exist or fought for justice instead of oppression.

   ? What period of history was your favorite to learn about? If you don’t like history, what is your favorite thing to learn about?

  "
415479,"
   What kind of details do you notice? / What do you notice that others often dont?
  ","
  i tend to notice people's changes in expression, even when it's just fleeting. when people are disappointed but they're too afraid to speak their feelings, or when they're angry and they're trying to suppress it.
  
  the other night, i noticed there was a feud going on between two girls at the bar over this one man who was giving them both attention. neither of my friends realized that there was friction between the two girls, but i picked up on the subtle hints and cues between them. i thought it was interesting from a bystander's perspective.

  most people i know seem more motivated when the weather is beautiful & sunny outside. however, i've always been more inspired when the weather is gray & dark, or when it's raining. i don't know why it inspires me more, but i always feel more like ""myself"" when the weather isn't at its best.
  "
415481,"
   There's a saying,  "" The more you know, the more you dont know.""

What's your understanding of it? And is there a boundary for curiosity?
  ","
  the more knowledge you have, the more you realize that knowledge is limitless and there will always be things you don't know. i've noticed that most ignorant people seem to think they know *everything* while those who are more educated or intelligent realize that there will always be more to learn.
  
  i don't think there will ever be a boundary for curiosity, no. no matter how much we think we know, there will always be more for us to educate ourselves on.

  it's been the same in the united states, actually -- so far, this winter has been incredibly mild (we only got one bout of snow right before thanksgiving), but everyone has been getting sick left and right. there have been the measles outbreaks, as well as the flu, which have hospitalized a lot of people & i think a few people have died from it as well.
  
  i don't think i've managed to avoid getting sick because i think i'm sick rn, lmao. i've had congestion, sneezing, coughing, etc etc., for the past month at least. thankfully it isn't anything worse than that, though.

   Do you prefer a beach destination, or something in the mountains? Which is more peaceful to you? :3
  ","
  the mountains have always been much more peaceful to me, as well as inspiring. when i lived in massachusetts, i lived in a region of the state where there were a lot of trees and mountains and hills, the college was situated right in the midst of a mountain range. it was honestly so inspiring for my writing, and i would often sneak out onto the roof of one of the lecture halls and watch the sun rise over the mountains if i was having a bad day.

  social media is both brilliant and toxic, depending on how you use it and who you choose to follow. on the one hand, social media can be a great educational tool and it's amazing how fast news travels via social media. there's really no reason for people *not* to be abreast of developments in current events.
  
  however, at the same time, it can be problematic if you associate yourself or follow the wrong crowd, and herd mentality definitely has the tendency to develop over time. on askfm especially, there has always been this pressure to believe in certain things & act certain ways in order to fit in with the crowd you're following to vie for their attention, and sometimes people feed off of each other too much to the point where it can be unhealthy.

  even though i was never a fan of physical education, i still think it's important to keep those classes in schools just for the sake of giving children a reason to run around and play sports for 30-40 minutes. everyone needs to be physically active, minus those with physical disabilities and such, and it's healthy to implement physical education in order to keep kids active.

   Do you think feminism do more bad than good and why?

  depends on what subtype of feminism you're talking about. white feminism is absolutely horrid and has done worse things for women in general, and as a result of the new wave feminism movement, many people simply don't take feminism seriously anymore since its viewed these days as a trend.
  
  intersectional feminism is great in theory, but again -- it's become a trend, which is terrible considering people have been spreading misinformation regarding intersectional feminism ever since it got on the popular radar.
  
  feminism used to be so radical, revolutionary, and good for implementing change in the past, i.e. the 1960s-80s. but these days, not so much. people are more apt to sit behind their keyboard and spew misinformation as opposed to being proactive with their ""activism"" and trying to advocate on behalf of women.

  i suppose it depends on her intentions. is she flirting with you because she likes you, or are her actions done unconsciously because it's simply part of who she is ?? some people are just naturally flirty and they have no real motive behind how they're acting, it's simply just the way they are.

   How would time tracking influence your activities? Would you do them faster? Would you stress more?
  ","
  i already track the time it takes for me to complete activities at work, and it's a bit of a source of inspiration for me to work more quickly and efficiently. i have to fill out a timesheet every day of the work i completed each hour, so it's a good challenge for me to see how much i can do in one day and compare it to previous days.

  i really can't think of any job where you aren't obligated to keep some sort of calendar. even with freelance jobs, you have deadlines to keep in mind even if you aren't necessarily commuting to an office every day, and deadlines are calendar dates in themselves.

  yes, i believe that people can change out of love. when you're truly in love with someone and that feeling is reciprocated, then you can be inspired to change your bad/toxic behaviors and habits in an effort to make yourself a better individual. we're constantly evolving as humans as it is, and experiencing love can be the fuel that triggers change.

  i think they have a grave misunderstanding of the services that planned parenthood actually provides, ranging from birth control and STD/STI testing to things such as pap smears, cancer screenings, hormone therapy and infertility treatment.
  
  if someone believes that a medical service shouldn't be funded when a large majority of their services include the aforementioned things, then i can only assume that individual doesn't want people with uteruses to obtain proper medical care.

  no, i don't think i'm more mature than other people my age. i'd say that my maturity level equals out to the same as other people in my age bracket (i.e. 25-30 years old).
  
  age can define one's maturity to a degree, but it can also be based on life experiences and the idea that a person may have been forced to ""grow up"" at a younger age than some of their peers. when i was younger, i would have said that i was more mature than my peers because i didn't have a genuine childhood, but these days, i would say i'm more or less the same maturity as everyone else.

  a more in-depth reporting/blocking system would really do askfm wonders. often people who are undeserving of being reported or banned get reported & banned, and those who are complete nuisances and break every single rule/guideline somehow can still make accounts. i think askfm should implement an IP ban.

  i don't need positive reinforcement, but i do enjoy it when it comes from certain people (my boyfriend, close friends, and my boss). sometimes it's nice to feel validated and know that you're doing a good job.

  i would go back to school and study either psychology or sociology. when i was in college, i debated on changing my major to sociology because i enjoyed the subject so much.
  
  as for which college, i really have no idea. probably somewhere like brown university or columbia university.
  "
415682,"
   Do you guys use Snapchat? If so, do you keep streaks? How many Snapchat views do you typically get?

  yeah, i use snapchat. i don't usually get streaks because i don't send people snaps every day, and i don't add things to my story either.

  a call center representative or a sales representative. basically any job where i have to talk to people for a living.

   What does non binary mean to you, how do you explain that to someone?

  non-binary simply means you're not one of the binaries of gender (man or woman). your gender is somewhere on the spectrum, but you don't exclusively identify as either a man or a woman.

  "
415711,"

  ","
  no, probably not. like scuba diving, it's never been something that i've been interested in doing.

  ","
  sometimes i am, yeah. it depends entirely on my mood that day, though.
  "
415713,"
   Would you like to try scuba diving?
  ","
  it isn't really something i've ever been interested in doing.
  "
415714,"
   Do you see yourself as having any worth at all in society?
  ","
  i already said that i have no importance to society, so no.
  "
415715,"
   How to seek freedom?
  ","
  step out of your comfort zone & do something you've always wanted to do but were previously afraid. take responsible risks if you know that there's a chance of a better outcome, and even if you fail, be content with the knowledge that at least you tried. scrap the dirt off your knees and try again, or approach it in a different manner.
  "
415716,"
   Who do you see as having significance in society?
  ","
  people who make a genuine difference in the world, i.e. scientists, professors and teachers, politicians (even though most of them don't have positive significance), attorneys, etc etc.
  "
415717,"
   What do you mean by you're not important?
  ","
  it's a pretty self-evident statement. i'm not important means that i'm not of any significance to society.
  "
415718,"
   How many of you can 100% honestly say that your opinion of someone you do like/get along with would NOT change if you found out they like/support things you strongly dislike/hate? I’m mostly referring to political views but interpret this however you please.
  ","
  my opinion of someone would change if i found out that they supported something that i was vehemently against, especially in cases where they don't support lgbtq+ rights, women's rights, people of color, etc etc. if a found out that a friend of mine was racist or sexist or whatever, then i would probably stop being friends with them.
  "
415719,"
   When its /not/ worth to be scared?
  ","
  it isn't worth it to be afraid when what you have to do will change you or your situation for the better. it's justified to be afraid of big changes and there's nothing wrong with it (in fact, it's expected in most cases), but it isn't worth holding yourself back in fear. you'll be better off in the long run.
  "
415720,"
   Are you spontaneous or you like to plan ahead?
  ","
  i'm spontaneous, especially since i don't know how i'm going to feel about a plan in the future. i tend to ask friends if they want to hang out a few hours before actually hanging out, if they happen to be available that night.
  "
415721,"
   What was the last 'nice' thing you did for yourself?
  ","
  i treated myself to an iced coffee when i got home from work because it makes me feel better when i have a bad day.
  "
415722,"
   Do you judge your position in society by comparing yourself to others?
  ","
  i don't have a position in society and i'm not important, so this question doesn't exactly apply to me.
  "
415723,"
   Do you think that everyone has inherent worth and dignity?
  ","
  not everyone, no. most people do, though.
  "
415724,"
   Is your body also your mind and how do you know the difference?
  ","
  the mind is different from the body, in my perspective at least. however, the mind can have effects on the body -- i.e., my anxiety causes me a lot of digestive problems, and then there are the obvious physical symptoms of anxiety attacks and panic attacks.
  "
415725,"
   If a friend asked you to borrow some money what would you say?
  ","
  i would ask them how much money and when could they pay me back.
  "
415726,"
   What became worse over time?
  ","
  my anxiety has been acting up again for some reason. i don't know if it's because there are some stressors in my life these days or because i need a stronger dose of anti-anxiety medication, though. i've been on the same dosage for a while, and it wouldn't surprise me if my body simply got used to it.
  "
415727,"
   Have you made changes yet in this new year? It doesn’t have to be something big
  ","
  i've started eating healthier again, i.e. more vegetables instead of carbs, fish instead of red meat, and less dairy.
  "
415728,"
   What’s something positive you tell yourself when everything seems to be wrong?
  ","
  when everything seems to be going wrong, i try to rationalize it to myself by saying that at least the only thing that can happen now is for things to get better. when you're at rock bottom, the only way you can go is up.
  "
415729,"
   When and where do you like to hideaway?
  ","
  my bedroom or my boyfriend's house. whenever i go over his house, it feels like a small vacation because i'm away from my family and i'm free to do whatever i want to do. even though my bedroom is somewhat of an escape for me as well, i'm constantly being interrupted.
  "
415730,"
   What lays unused/not being used?
  ","
  lately, my fish tank is not being used. ever since my fish died, i haven't decided on whether or not i want to have more fish, so i've just been maintaining the tank until i make a decision.
  "
415731,"
   Strange question
  ","
  i agree. they had a follow up question, but i deleted it.
  "
415732,"
   What made you anxious?
  ","
  probably a combination of the stress associated with the new material i'm learning at work, my exhaustion because i didn't sleep well last night, and my mind racing because that's generally how my brain behaves. sometimes there isn't necessarily a reason behind anxiety either. i often have bouts of anxiety with no real reason behind it at all.
  "
415733,"
   Are you a creative person?
  ","
  i used to be extremely creative in that i would always be drawing, painting, writing, doing photography, etc etc. these days, i haven't had the time or motivation to really delve into those hobbies, although i have been trying to write every day.
  "
415734,"
   Hopeful for what?
  ","
  hopeful for the future, mainly. i don't hold quite a pessimistic outlook on myself or my future, whereas when i feel hopeless, i feel as if there's no point in anything i'm doing, my future is bleak, and that i don't deserve to live.
  "
415735,"
   Ever tasted blood?
  ","
  yeah, i've tasted blood before.
  "
415736,"
   Did you have a fun day?
  ","
  no, my day was difficult and aggravating. my anxiety started acting up after lunch, and i didn't have any of my anti-anxiety pills on me, so i couldn't focus on my work and i started getting extremely overwhelmed. i ended up leaving an hour early because i felt awful.
  "
415737,"
   Have you ever watch it?
  ","
  i used to watch toonami on adult swim when i was much younger, but that was pretty much it.
  "
415738,"
   Who/What could spoil your day?
  ","
  my family members severely alter my mood and can really ruin my day if something happens or someone berates or yells at me, especially if it's through text message in the middle of the day when i'm not even home.
  
  it happens at least twice a month, unfortunately.
  "
415739,"
   How do you determine if your life is going ok?
  ","
  when my life is going okay, my mental health is a lot better. i don't experience much anxiety and my depression doesn't flare up as often. i find myself feeling motivated and hopeful as opposed to hopeless and exhausted.
  "
415740,"
   are you usually afraid of the dark?
  ","
  not really, no. sometimes my mind is too active & it makes me paranoid, but i do sleep better in the darkness.
  "
415741,"
   What do you use/consume too much?
  ","
  i drink way too much coffee, it's probably pretty unhealthy.
  "
415742,"
   who are you when no one's watching?
  ","
  i'm the same person that i am when people *are* watching, although perhaps a bit more sloppy and lazy. i see no reason to put on a facade in front of other people, it seems exhausting.
  "
415743,"
   When you were in grammar school did you play the recorder in music class?
  ","
  lol, i believe i did.
  "
415744,"
   Is it easy for you to adapt to work after weekends/holidays?
  ","
  somewhat, yeah. sometimes it's difficult for me to find motivation in the morning, but eventually i get back into the routine.
  "
415745,"
   Do you watch anime?
  ","
  no, i don't watch anime.
  "
415746,"
   do you and your bf share everything?
  ","
  nah, not everything. i tell him about what i do at work sometimes, but i don't bother telling him my conversations with my coworkers or anything like that. i don't tell him about most things regarding askfm either. occasionally, i'll tell him about a funny interaction or ask his opinion on a question if it makes me think, but that's it.
  "
415747,"
   Are you more of a movie or book person? Why? 
Assuming that the book and movie are about the same thing.
  ","
  i've always been more of a book person. in most cases, i prefer the book over the movie especially since movie adaptations of books often leave out crucial information or alter timelines.
  "
415748,"
   How often do you do things for yourself?
  ","
  i try to do at least one small thing for myself every day, whether that's simply sitting down with a cup of coffee & quietly listening to music in order to relax, or treating myself to one of my favorite treats.
  "
415749,"
   Do you get along better with males or females? Why?
  ","
  it depends entirely on the individual. it's difficult to really class people based on sex because everyone's personalities are so different. i think my friend clint is pretty equal in regards to males versus females.
  "
415750,"
   What do you want to change within yourself to be happier?
  ","
  my physical appearance, mostly. i would also enjoy if i didn't take what people in my life say closely to heart, because often i can act irrationally in response to things and think too deeply into what they might mean.
  "
415751,"
   Do you believe that you should talk about EVERY little thing with your partner or are some things better to keep to yourself?
  ","
  you're under no obligation to tell your partner every single, little thing going on in your life. while that works for some people, it definitely doesn't work for everyone & i can understand some people wanting to keep certain things to themselves that not even their partner knows about.
  "
415752,"
   you should get a hobby
  ","
  i have plenty of hobbies, lol. god forbid i feel like answering questions on askfm when i'm home from work.

415756,"
   Have you ever known someone online for years but have never seen their face or heard their voice?

  yes !! that pretty much defined my early internet days -- i would talk to people on message boards and wouldn't know what they looked like until years later when we all migrated to another social media site, i.e. myspace or facebook.
  "
415757,"
   Can you easily choose ONE favourite song?
  ","
  one all-time favorite song ?? no.
  
  however, i've been listening to ""hallucinogenics"" by matt maeson nonstop, so i suppose that's my *current* favorite song.

  ","
  it's been fairly low these days tbh.
  "
415759,"
   Do you value someones attention more if you are the only one receiving it?
  ","
  the only people's attention i truly value are the attentions of my boyfriend and close friends. i don't really care for the attention of anyone else, and quite frankly, sometimes it does irritate me if someone is trying to get my attention and i don't care for them.
  "
415760,"
   One more questions✌ ""How's life treating you""?
  ","
  i have no complaints at the moment, which is a nice change from the usual. i've had a lot more motivation these days compared to the past few years, and i actually have a semi-positive outlook for the future. there are some things i wish i could change, but right now, they're mostly out of my control so the only thing i can really do is ride it out and take each day as it comes.
  "
415761,"
   What kind of houses/rooms do you like?
  ","
  i prefer rustic or industrial-styled homes -- a lot of wood, piping, brown and mahogany colors, etc etc. i also love big bay windows and natural lighting, as well as skylights, and fireplaces.
  "
415762,"
   What's the last thing you laughed about till you cried?
  ","
  i don't remember what it was that i was laughing about, but it happened last night. lmao. i just remember laughing to the point where it made my abdomen hurt & tears were welling up in my eyes.
  "
415763,"
   Would you like to build/design your own house?
  ","
  it personally makes no difference to me, but considering my boyfriend is a handyman, that's essentially his lifelong dream. he always discusses what sorts of rooms he wants, what he wants in those rooms, blueprints for the house, where he'll put his fish tanks and lizard tanks, etc etc.
  
  because of that, i've always envisioned us buying an old home and basically reworking it little by little.
  "
415764,"
   What is the first thing you do when you're bored?
  ","
  check up on social media, i.e. instagram, askfm, and twitter usually. if nothing is going on there, then i'll usually put netflix on and watch something in the meantime. i also play video games when i'm bored too.
  "
415765,"
   Is your page active? Do you get questions everyday?
  ","
  my page is fairly active, yes. i always wake up to at least 10 questions, and i get a few here & there throughout the day as well. this evening has actually been incredibly active, for some weird reason.
  "
415766,"
   Do you get a lot of hate?
  ","
  i used to a lot in the past, but not so much anymore. i never respond to anon hate, so i assume that whoever used to send it to me just got tired of getting no response out of me, so they stopped.
  "
415767,"

  no, i have no reason to disable anonymous questions. if i did, then my inbox would be bone-dry all the time, lol.
  "

   In your opinion in there a set age for wearing braces. I’m soo anxious and worried what will people at work think of me, my 30 birthday is in a few months.
  ","
  there's definitely *not* an age limit for wearing braces !! one of my friends who's 28 years old just got her braces taken off after wearing them for 2-3 years. she shared your anxiety when she was about to get them because of the whole age thing, but the truth is, if it's something you either want or need to do, then it shouldn't matter how old you are.
  
  she became *so* much more confident in herself throughout the process, and eventually the fear and anxiety wore off. i'm sure the same will happen to you. :'))

   What features attracts your attention when you see a stranger? Do you look more into the way someones dressed or into their facial features?
  ","
  i tend to notice facial features more often -- high cheekbones, jutting jawlines, sharp brow bones, piercing eyes, etc etc. i also tend to notice a person's hair first & foremost, the way it's colored and styled.

   What do you think of men who searching for women to date on ask?
  ","
  i think it's silly, considering askfm isn't a dating website. they would probably have better luck on tinder, grindr, plentyoffish, okcupid, match, etc etc.
  
  there are a lot of different options out there for people who desire a relationship, and i never understood why some people would choose askfm when it isn't even remotely close to a dating site.

   Do you think the LGBT community can do more to accommodate black people and trans? I feel like a small, but loud minority have made it quite an exclusive space, and are militant about it
  ","
  yeah, there's still so much discrimination against black & trans people in the lgbtq+ community !! lgbtq+ representation is primarily white-washed, i've noticed, and there isn't adequate representation of trans or non-binary individuals in the community either, to the point where there's erasure from cisgender or white folks -- especially on social media.
  
  a lot of people like to preach that they're all for equal rights, etc etc., but they neglect to bring up the complexities of discrimination that occur against people of color and trans individuals.
  "
415793,"
   What is something you have to do to fall asleep?

415794,"
   What is the point of being alive when in the end you're just going to die?
  ","
  to create a life that's worth living up until the moment we perish. we're here on earth for one reason or another (and that reason differs with each person), so the best thing we can do in any circumstance is learn to take this life to our advantage and do something that makes it worthwhile.
  "
415795,"
   Do you think LGBT+ is right to accept them?
  ","
  of course. people in the lgbtq+ community are deserving of equal respect and compassion, and just because they're not heterosexual doesn't mean that they're inferior to those who are.
  
  people in the lgbtq+ community have a long history of being oppressed & disrespected, and i would certainly hope that in 2019 that discrimination will end against them.

  that only happens to me sometimes -- usually by the time sunday night rolls around, i'm mentally prepared for work again on monday morning.
  
  i remember feeling horrible & anxious when i worked my last job, though. i always dreaded going into that job, especially on monday mornings because i would have to spend the entire morning catching up on emails and phonecalls from the weekend. i was so stressed out, and it was a nightmare for me.

  i agree. that doesn't mean that rvpe wouldn't happen if a male couldn't get an erection, though. if they want to exert power and control over another individual in the form of rvpe, if they couldn't use their body parts, then they would likely find other sources.

  no. rvpe occurs out of a need for power & control, it isn't usually solely out of a sxxual desire. men rvpe others as a means of exerting power over that individual.

  everyone (with the exception of a few select kinds of individuals) deserves basic respect and decency. obviously if a person is being disrespectful or discriminatory towards another, they should be corrected. but the way you phrased this insinuates that *everyone* who is trans, gay, or female, etc etc., are discriminatory, which obviously isn't the case.

  you brought up some really good points !! i can't copy/paste on my phone but i did read all of your messages.
  
  i can understand it being complicated if the surrogate develops a connection with the child, because that can often happen even if the person thinks previously that they won't be emotionally involved. pregnancy alters your hormones so pretty much anything can happen in that regard, regardless of the legal documents involved in the case too.

  yes, i believe vaccinations should legally be mandatory. they're necessary for the survival of children, and it's extremely irresponsible to not vaccinate your children because even if they don't get sick, they can pass on those symptoms to children who are too young to get the necessary vaccinations. it's dangerous for everyone involved, and anti-vaxx parents are partially the reasons why there have been such an outbreak of what used to be rare diseases in children.

  i get scared when i'm going into the garage to take the garbage out because it's so dark in there, lmao. i run to turn on the lights, because i still have that childish fear of someone or something hiding in the garage that will attack me.

  that sounds like a ""you"" problem, not a ""me"" problem.

   Are you creative with making usernames or coming up with nicknames?
  ","
  i've had way too many usernames over the past 15 years, so i guess i have been creative with them, lol.
  "
415885,"
   Do you hold grudges over little things? For example you weren’t invited to a party or someone not replying back to you.
  ","
  sometimes, i do. they're not so much grudges as much as they are temporary feelings of dislike, though. they don't last very long & i can go from disliking a friend for not texting me back or inviting me somewhere, to later on, talking to them as if nothing happened a few days later out of needing the social interaction.
  "
415886,"
   Do you make up your own traditions in your family?
  ","
  no, my family doesn't have any traditions.
  "
415887,"
   Why though?
  ","
  it just isn't something my family buys, and i'm not the biggest fan of the taste anyway.

  i prefer blueberries, raspberries, peaches, and bananas.
  
  there aren't really any fruits i dislike, i just prefer the above ones over others. the fruit i probably dislike the most is blackberries, though. they just taste bitter to me.

   Would you rather have a boss who can be a jerk but knows his job and is always available if you need help or the boss who’s cool and relaxed but you can’t ever find him when you need them or they don’t know how to do certain tasks?
  ","
  i would always prefer the former as opposed to the latter option. most of the time, bosses can be jerks because of the immense pressure on them to have tasks done in a timely manner and with efficiency, and sometimes their higher-ups have unrealistic expectations. if that boss is a jerk but is also readily available to you at all times and willing to help, then that's a really good compromise.
  "
415892,"
   A breakup will never be a mutual agreement. One party will always be affected more by the break up and hurt.
  ","
  a breakup can be a mutual agreement while still being hurtful to both parties, which is normally the case. i've seen relationships where they broke up due to the understanding that they weren't in the right time frame to pursue their relationship further, and they ended up getting back together after a few years.
  "
415893,"
   Does sleep deprivation counts as self harm? What weird self harm ways do you know?
  ","
  no, sleep deprivation is not a method of self harm.
  
  self harm is clearly defined in the DSM-IV and DSM-V as the intentional, direct injuring of the body without having svicidal intentions. this includes c*tting, burning, scratching or hitting. it used to include skin-picking & hair-pulling, but i don't think these classify as traditional methods of self harm anymore.
  "
415894,"

415895,"
   Do you tend to listen to music when you are free doing nothing or busy working/doing chores?
  ","
  yes !! i'm pretty much *always* listening to music, except for when i'm at work (music distracts me when i'm working). however, when it comes to doing household chores or just being lazy at home, i'm normally listening to music all the time.
  "
415896,"
   How can someone be “right” if they willingly break up with you and hurt you? If they truly love you they will wait.
  ","
  if they're okay with hurting you, then they're probably not the right person, no. i was referring more to relationships where the breakup is a mutual agreement because they're not at the right moment of their lives to successfully pursue that relationship -- this is seen pretty often when people are attending college in different places.
  
  i understand waiting for that person, but i also understand breaking up temporarily so that each person can experience their lives and the people in their lives as it happens. just because you break up with someone also doesn't necessarily mean that they're never going to be in your life anymore, either.
  "
415897,"

415899,"
   watching people’s stories make me sad and jealous. It’s hard for me to not compare myself to their perfect life. do you ever feel the same?
  ","
  i get those same feelings sometimes, yeah. however, you have to remember that nobody's life is *perfect* and people choose to only post about their successes and good times as opposed to their struggles. even so, sometimes it can be difficult to really watch those successes because they seem so much more poignant than our successes (even if objectively that isn't the case), so i totally understand where you're coming from.
  "
415900,"
   What’s new in your life? Did 2019 bring something yet?
  ","
  surprisingly, yes !! the second day of the year, my boss called me over to her desk to help set me up and train me on the administrative duties of one of the programs my company offers to their members.
  
  it's something she's been wanting to train me on for a while, but hasn't had the chance to because she's been so busy with everything else. so on wednesday, we sat down and discussed my responsibilities within the program and she gave me a bunch of assignments to complete for the rest of the week. i ended up finishing all of the outstanding orders from 2018 between wednesday and friday.
  "
415901,"
   how come you have a lot of questions?
  ","
  probably because i used the QOTD last night to post ""anyone have any questions ??"" to invite people to ask me things, and then i ended up falling asleep shortly thereafter. lmao.
  "
415902,"
   What’s your fav social media and why?
  ","
  askfm & instagram.
  
  i like askfm because i find the questions people ask me to be interesting, and it also gives me the opportunity to educate people about topics such as mental health. i also like reading my friends' answers.
  
  instagram, i mainly use for IG stories and posting photos occasionally. it helps me keep in contact with some of my coworkers as well, and it's interesting to have that sneak peek of insight into another person's life when you view their stories.
  "
415903,"
   When you talk do you go straight to the point or do you try to shift the conversation slowly?
  ","
  i usually just go straight to the point, personally. however, it's not as if it's random because it's usually related to the initial conversation, lol. i'm very honest and open with my friends & boyfriend during conversations, so i have no issue with asking a question or something.
  "
415904,"
   What do you know about drugs? Is it better to know more or less about them?
  ","
  i know a fairly decent amount of information about drugs due to my own personal experiences with them.
  
  i think it's better to have an in-depth understanding of drugs as opposed to being ignorant about them, because you simply don't know who in your life may be struggling with addiction and requires help. if you understand drugs and how they work, it'll be easier to help that person rather than if you had no idea about drugs whatsoever.
  "
415905,"
   How are you leigh?
  ","
  i'm doing well -- i woke up not too long ago (yes, even though it's noon ...), so now i'm just having my first cup of coffee for the day and checking up on social media. i found a lot of questions in my inbox, so i decided to hop on my laptop to answer them faster instead of wasting my phone's battery.
  "
415906,"
   Can you still love someone but break up with them?
  ","
  yes, i believe so. this coincides partially with my last answer regarding relationships, but if you and your partner don't have the same ideas in regards to the future to the point where you feel you must break up in order to progress further in your life, then it's completely possible for you to still love that person and vice versa while ending the relationship.
  
  in addition, i always found it interesting that some people can be the ""right"" person for each other, but they're simply at the wrong point in their lives to pursue that relationship.
  "
415907,"
   Have you ever been forced into having a conversation with your family or people you share a house with due to the Wi-Fi going down? ? Was it very forced and awkward or did you find out you had alot in common?? ?
  ","
  LOL, YES. the electricity for the entire block went down a few months ago, so we really couldn't do anything for a few hours until the power came back on.
  
  i ended up sitting with my parents and having really awkward, estranged conversation with them, which was absolutely terrible. i still had 4G on my phone so i could technically still use the internet, but i didn't want to waste my battery so i didn't use it at all.
  "
415908,"
   when you shop do you check the date?
  ","
  yeah, i always check the date when i shop for food.
  "
415909,"
   What do you do when the path you want to carve isn’t the same as the one you love?
  ","
  if you and your partner don't have the same ideas in mind in terms of your future, then there isn't really much you *can* do, unfortunately. your relationship may be great in the present moment, but that doesn't mean things won't see friction in the future when it comes to ideas such as marriage or having a family.
  
  at that point, it might be best for you two to break up in order to find someone else who better fits those interests.

  "
415911,"
   Are you uptight about expired food/beauty products?

  food products, yes. it isn't worth the risk of getting sick if something says it's expired, with the exception of some items if they still look/smell/taste fine. i won't f*ck with dairy products, though.
  
  beauty products, not so much. i've been using the same concealer for two years, and it's been perfectly fine for me, lol.
  "
415912,"
   How do you think - what do you need to do to become popular in ask.fm ? ??

  i suppose just remaining active on the site -- asking questions, answering questions, liking other people's answers, making polls, etc etc.
  "
415913,"
   Do you always read the reviews before buying a product?
  ","
  for the most part, yes. especially when it comes to buying things off of amazon. there are so many similar products that it's difficult to really determine which one is the best one, so the review section is extremely helpful in that regard.

  "
415958,"
   thats not true, even a little girl in elementary school knows what girls are ""supposed to look and act like"" and she could say i dont want to look or act like that, it doesnt mean she is non-binary.
  ","
  for some people, it could very much mean so. there's a separation between gender and rebelling against societal expectations. personally speaking, i wanted to be a boy for much of my earlier life, even my parents have told me stories of me wanting to be a boy and dressing as a boy and not doing certain things because boys didn't do those things.
  
  it's different. and i understand that because you're not non-binary or trans, that you may not understand it completely. however, that doesn't mean that you can't respect people still even if you disagree with them.
  "
415959,"
   in labeling yourself as non-binary, you are submitting yourself to the societal norm that ""a woman must look and act a certain way, and since you dont, you're not a woman"". you are unintentionally supporting the very concept you are against.
  ","
  considering i've never been a woman, this doesn't apply to me. i haven't been comfortable identifying as a woman or a girl my entire life, even before i was aware of the traditional societal expectations that are placed upon women. it's only been within the past three years that i discovered what non-binary meant, and before that, i just used the term genderfluid.
  "
415960,"
   non-binary was just a feminist term used to attack the traditional gender role of a woman. they wanted to be so anti-traditional woman that they stopped identifying as woman altogether. they later realized that uh, you can be a woman without fitting to any societal norms.
  ","
  thank you, i'm quite aware of the whole societal norms concept.
  "
415961,"
   all your feminist friends stopped identifying as non binary. you should follow their suits
  ","
  i'm happy that they discovered who they truly are, as it takes a lot of self realization to really figure out things that are so integral to your sense of self.
  
  that doesn't change my gender, though. just because a few people i know realized they weren't non-binary doesn't mean that i'm not.
  "
415962,"

  you have to have communication in your relationship -- sit her down and tell her how you honestly feel, how it's affecting you, and how you feel like things used to be fun but aren't much anymore. perhaps you two can come to a compromise regarding how to liven up your relationship again.

  no, white people can be subjected to discrimination, but not racism. racism is a system of oppression characterized by decades, if not centuries, of harm, and white people were often the people doing the oppressing, not being a victim to the oppression.

  the worst way to study, from my experience, is by cramming the material in the day before the exam. it's information overload and there's a great chance of you not remembering crucial information.

   Compared to you I am a pedo apologist. You think a pedo that has never done anything wrong and says he would never do anything wrong and it appears that he won't take any action should still have life in prison? And by the way just because something is a crime doesn't always mean it's wrong
  ","
  ... did you really just insinuate that being attracted to children isn't wrong ??
  
  oh boy. all right, i'mma just leave this here. my case has been closed.
  "
416092,"
   Diff anon, a non offending pedo being denied help due to someone being unaccepting doesn't mean they deserve life in jail. They deserve help.
  ","
  i already posted my opinion on that stance a few answers ago. in short, non-offending p*dophiles are at high risk of acting on their thoughts and the rate in which p*dophilia is ""cured"" is significantly low.
  
  for the safety of everyone involved, prison is the only answer in my eyes.
  "
416093,"
   ""you're messed up and they're messed up""

.....how are you gonna equate BPD, depression, and anxiety to literally wanting to m*lest kids lmfao wtf. People with those disorders are most at risk themselves, NOT other people.
  ","
  that's exactly what i was thinking. people with mood disorders or personality disorders (among others) are often the victims of sxxual abvse themselves. to compare depression/anxiety/BPD/psychosis/whatever with p*dophilia is unfounded.
  "
416094,"
   Yeah kinda like your existence. You're messed and they're messed up they didn't choose it just like you didn't choose it
  ","
  you're sounding like a p*do apologist, and if this continues, then i'm discontinuing this discussion.
  
  in simple terms, you can't compare p*dophilia with other disorders because it's literally a criminal offense.
  "
416095,"
   What if someone becomes that way because of prior ab*se?
  ","
  it makes no difference to me. if you're attracted to children, then you can rot in prison regardless of whether or not you've acted on your thoughts or why you developed that attraction to begin with. it's inherently wrong, immoral, and disgusting.
  "
416096,"
   What do you consider a pedo? We're taking about people attracted to kids under 12 right?
  ","
  according to scientific reports, p*dophilia is attraction to prepubescent children, so i'm assuming there isn't a concrete age.
  "
416097,"
   Don t you think there's a lot of pedophiles that never do anything wrong?
  ","
  the fact that they're a p*dophile automatically means that their very existence is wrong.
  "
416098,"
   I see where ur coming from but that would be somewhat irrational because u can't jail for thought crimes. It's like jailing someone for thinking about stealing but never doing it.
  ","
  ... you can't compare stealing something to someone being attracted to children.
  "
416099,"
   Don't u think non offending p*dos should be given help ? It's a paraphilic disorder recognized by the DSM-5
  ","
  p*dophiles rarely seek professional treatment for their attraction because they either don't believe that what they're thinking is wrong, or if they do know it's wrong, they're less likely to report their thoughts to a professional in fear of imprisonment, considering it's a criminal offense.
  
  that being said, the rate in which p*dophiles actually ""recover"" from their attraction is significantly low. they're better off just being thrown in jail, in my opinion, so that they're not given any opportunity to act on their desires.

  "
416104,"

  no. being mentally ill doesn't excuse you from acting out on problematic or toxic behavior. you don't get a pass just because you're mentally ill. you still know right from wrong.
  "
416105,"

  ","
  yes -- i believe that p*dophiles are inherently bad people even if they never acted out on their fantasies.

   Do you ever feel like you're a bad person?
  ","
  i've done some pretty terrible things, but i'm not an inherently bad person.
  "
416107,"
   But if no one was telling you that you have a mental illness then you wouldn't know you had one is what I'm saying.  Maybe your'e the healthy one and all those telling you that you're mentally ill are the mentally ill ones?
  ","
  i've known i've been mentally ill since i was 11 years old. i didn't start seeking formal treatment until i was 24 years old.
  
  so no -- my conclusions weren't based on what people told me, those diagnoses were established after i discussed my ongoing symptoms with a professional for several appointments.
  "
416108,"
   Are you saying that bad people aren't mentally ill in some way?
  ","
  it's impossible to conclude that *all* people in a group are one way or another -- life isn't black & white like that. while there are some people who are genuinely terrible people who probably do struggle with unresolved mental health issues, that doesn't infer that everyone who is a bad person must have a mental illness.
  "
416109,"
   So by your logic, there is no such thing as mental illness, yeah?
  ","
  where have i ever suggested that mental illness doesn't exist. lmfao.
  
  did you forget that i'm in ongoing treatment for my own mental illnesses ??
  "
416110,"
   I mean, does a guy who lies pathologically all the time and who is a megalomaniac and a misogynist and who can be a president of a country suffer from mental illness?
  ","
  like i said earlier, it's wrong to armchair diagnosis a person without conducting a formal psychiatric evaluation on them. there have been concerns about trump's mental health in the past, but considering no one who made those claims ever met trump or are likely not even mental health practitioners, then their claims are unfounded.
  
  it's easy to point at a """"bad"""" person and attribute their behavior to mental illness, but that only adds to the stigma surrounding mental health. there are simply people out there who are genuinely bad people and that has nothing to do with mental illness.
  "
416111,"
   No, you have misunderstood my intent.  If anything, I'm suggesting that some societal groups who are deemed to be normal and who pathologise mental illness are themselves potentially mentally ill by what they believe.
  ","
  i don't think it's really correct to assume that someone automatically has a mental illness solely because they believe in god. it's also wrong to armchair diagnosis people without actually knowing them or performing a formal psychiatric evaluation individually.
  "
416112,"
   What spectrum do you mean?  I don't understand that

  btw these questions are leaning toward the ableist end of the spectrum, fyi.
  "
416115,"
   Why are schizophrenics seen as being pathological when people who believe in and talk to God aren't?
  ","
  schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by changes in genetic composition and chemical imbalances that lend themselves to some of the primary symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, etc etc.
  
  people who think they can talk to god or have seen """"visions"""" from god aren't normally mentally ill or have those specific chemical compositions. that's why disorders like schizophrenia are medical conditions, while believing in god is just religious belief.

  not recently, no. most of my friendships dwindle away over time, i don't necessarily have falling outs with them for a specific reason. we just stop talking as time goes on until we don't talk anymore.

  ","
  physically -- my back hurts and i'm congested, but otherwise i'm okay. i also have a nasty cough, but i'm assuming i have a cold so that's to be expected.
  
  mentally -- i'm actually doing well lately. today i have this profound motivation to clean everything, which is unheard of for me because i struggle with motivation most of all but today it's nonexistent. i haven't felt depressed in a month or two, and while my anxiety has been acting up due to the weather and stuff, it's definitely manageable. i even decreased my therapy sessions from once per week to once every two weeks.

  i wouldn't date someone who's considered a boy, period. i'm also in a relationship, so i have no intentions on dating anyone else.

  ideally, i would want it to be smaller & more rustic/whimsical. homemade center pieces and goodies, an alter surrounded by flowers, and somewhere preferably outdoors.
  
  however, it's a bit unrealistic due to how big our families are -- most likely, we'll have it in a moderately fancy catering hall with a dance floor and an open bar, but i would still want it to be woodsy feeling with homemade pieces and flowers.

  my relationship doesn't make me feel claustrophobic ; in fact, quite the opposite. his encouragement & support have given me the freedom to truly be myself, and he's helped me learn about myself over the past 10 years.

   PA's supreme court ruled friday moms who use illegal drugs while pregnant cannot be considered perpetrators of child abxse. the supreme court's main opinion said the law's definition of a child does not include fetuses or unborn children under the child protective services law. thoughts?!
  ","
  if you're pregnant with the intent of having that child, then i believe that using illegal drugs *should* be grounds for child abvse. it doesn't matter if the legal definition of a child doesn't include unborn fetuses at that point because the mother has full intent of bringing that pregnancy to fruitation and birthing the baby.
  
  studies have shown that using illegal drugs during pregnancy can lead to myriad illnesses in newborns, including FAS, low birth weight, birth defects, etc etc. those can be directly attributed to the mother's use of illicit substances during pregnancy, and it's wild to be how that *wouldnt* be considered some form of abvse or neglect.
  
  however, despite all of that, i still believe that the mothers deserve professional treatment regarding substance abvse and rehabilitation. the safety of the child is the most important thing and rehabilitation of the mother is integral to giving the child the best possible life they can lead.

  it depends entirely on the relationship and the individual. some people are more open about their pasts while others prefer to keep it private.
  
  it seems that a lot of people like to wait a little bit to get to know their partner first before asking about their past sexual history, depending on comfort levels. there's also the idea of ""what's in the past is in the past"" and it doesn't matter anymore. so if you want to ask your partner about their history, then that's entirely up to you.

   what are your thoughts on women who feel that other women owe their bodies to their partner for just being in a relationship with them and it’s necessary for them to meet their partners needs no matter what they’re going through in order to keep them faithful? 
-(if this makes sense)-
  ","
  i disagree with the concept that women *owe* their partners sex -- people's bodies, regardless of their gender, are theirs and theirs alone. sex is not an obligation in a relationship, and sex also doesn't guarantee that a partner won't be unfaithful either.
  
  everyone's relationship is different, and some place more emphasis on sex than others. in cases where someone expects a lot of sex, then yeah -- they might look elsewhere if their needs aren't being satisfied (ideally they should talk to their partner first, but we all know a lot of people would rather cheat than do that). however, that's between those two people and other people's opinions on an individual relationship are meaningless.

   I know you mean well but this is so wrong. I don't say ""yes"" every time I have s+x with my partner.

Consent is important but not blk&white
  ","
  i agree with you -- that's why i said something along the lines of ""saying yes at first and then saying no"" and everything else in that answer.
  
  i don't give my boyfriend a resounding ""yes"" either sometimes, but it's a mutual agreement and he knows that if i hesitate, say yes and then say no after a while, or don't give him a straight answer, then it's also a ""no"" and not consent.

  choking kinks are consensual, so it's completely different. you're consenting to that activity and couples have a safe word to ensure safety.

  ","
  the best thing you can honestly do is overcome that initial fear and hang out with them -- you'll get more comfortable over time. the anxiety really does suck but you'll feel better once you're with them.

416646,"

416647,"
   Why do you think DDLG is disgusting can you elaborate?

  you're essentially pretending to be a child and putting it in a sxxual context -- not to mention the fact that it makes light of inc*st and other trauma that some people go through and creates a kink out of people's trauma. it's gross.

  ","
  i'm sorry you're feeling this way -- i've been in the same boat myself, although with mental illness not physical illness. i know how horrible and isolating it feels to get so low that you contemplate ending your life.
  
  have you tried seeking professional counseling to help you handle your thoughts ?? physical health undoubtedly affects mental health and its always healthy to pursue mental health treatment especially if you think you're in danger.
  "
416649,"
   Are you a cheapskate
  ","
  no, i like to save money on things but i'm not stingy or greedy when it comes to my money. you can always earn more, the way i see it, and it's worth spending money on experiences and things that make you happy as long as it won't be damaging to you.

416650,"
   What is most valuable for you during the holidays?

  you're not obligated to be friends with anyone. if someone is giving you a bad vibe then you have to do what you need to preserve yourself and protect yourself. whether that means telling them you can't be friends, ignoring and blocking them, etc etc. it depends on the situation.

416837,"
   white people are not oppressed and are not denied basic human rights just for being white. the definition of ‘racism’ is pretty ambiguous, it’s not always literal. also, whites only experience discrimination (stereotypes) whereas POC are racially profiled. just know, reverse racism is a myth.

  i honestly just don't think you're understanding where i'm coming from, which is understandable. sometimes things sound more logical in my head compared to when i try to write them down. i'm simply trying to make the distinction to you of the difference between racism and discrimination.
  
  ideally, those should be outcomes of both of those situations. however, it makes me wonder if the black person on trial would be given the death sentence as opposed to a life sentence because of the bias involved in the criminal justice system.

   If black on white crime is racially motivated, would that not be racist in your view? 


There isn't really an issue with changing the definition of the word racism, if that's what it means to you. But I will ask why you do this?
  ","
  the definition of words do change over time, and there's nothing wrong with that. while in the past it may have also applied to white people, but further studies into racism as a whole have revealed that it's a system of oppression, much like sexism. white people have never been oppressed due to their race, which is why they can't experience racism.
  
  obviously white people do face discrimination because of a number of things, race included, but the racism is fundamentally different than discrimination.

  i can eat cold pizza, but i don't really enjoy it. it's usually hangover food for me tbh, especially since i'm too lazy at that point to heat it in the microwave for a minute, lol.

   How does the law discriminate against colored people? How does it work in white people's favor? People of color have equal rights. Moreover, this just isn't how racism works. If you dislike or favor a race over others, that's racism.
  ","
  people of color may have equal rights as it pertains to written law, such as having voting rights, but often that isn't how the law is interpreted in court. there's a lot of bias in the justice system regarding people of color, particularly black people, and often people who commit the same crimes who are white end up getting lesser sentences.
  
  regarding your second statement, discrimination is favoring one thing (in this case race) over the other. racism, on the other hand, is a system of oppression based upon a person's race that basically isn't white.

  ","
  i don't know your friend, nor do i know you, so i have no clue if his messages even ""mean"" something at all. if he's not responding to you, he could simply be busy.

   Do you agree that it’s racist to punish a White man and assume he’s guilty without even giving him a fair trial?

   Has anyone ever come to you when they felt like giving up? How would comfort them?

  i've had a few people come to me when they've been struggling, both online and in real life. how i comfort them depends entirely on their situation and how they currently feel, because those factors dictate what i say to them, how i say it, etc etc.
  
  generally speaking, i allow them to vent as much as they need to. i also encourage them to seek professional help in the form of therapy if that's something they agree that they should do in order to help sort out their issues. i encourage them to seek creative outlets, i.e. writing out their feelings, music, working out, etc etc. i also remind them that they've come this far and they can overcome anything they set their mind to.

  ","
  that's really difficult to really process because honestly, i don't know how i would feel about that either. depending on the relationship, there sometimes needs to be at least some level of physical attraction -- however, there are also some people who don't place any value in physical attraction at all and only base their attraction solely on personality.

416927,"
   how has medication helped you? i was put on a mood stabilizer and im not even sure how medications work and im kind of wary on starting to become ""dependent"" on it.
  ","
  scientifically-speaking, medication changes the way hormones and chemicals react in your brain which relate to levels of serotonin, dopamine, etc etc. mood stabilizers target specific molecules, from my understanding, that aid in the stabilization of severe mood swings.
  
  it takes 1-2 weeks for most psychiatric medications to begin working, including mood stabilizers. personally speaking, i'm on a mood stabilizer, antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and antipsychotic. they all target different symptoms that i experience, so as a result, my moods are significantly less severe, my depressions aren't as low, my anxiety isn't terrible, i rarely experience panic attacks, and my paranoia has diminished greatly.
  
  you can't become dependent on medications that aren't narcotics. if you ever want to stop taking them, you can simply wean off of them with the guidance of your doctor and you won't experience any negative side effects.
  "

   Everyone has their own way in categorizing people; in this case, good and bad people. How you categorize them?

  i think people are good or bad depending upon their intentions. if they have conventionally bad intentions, such as to hurt other people, then i would consider them an overall bad person. however, if your intentions are good at heart and you want to help others -- even if that help may be misguided -- then i would still consider you a good person.
  
  there are also a lot of gray areas to take into account because life isn't simply black and white, good and bad, etc etc. someone may simultaneously display both good and bad intentions, or they may want to act on their bad thoughts but quell their temptations because it's socially taboo.

  being sxxually abvsive is a different mindset than being physically or verbally abvsive because in the case of sxxual abvse, you're literally attracted to children, and that's something that's incredibly difficult to change -- if it can even be changed at all. in rare cases, sxxual abvsers may be able to look back on their behavior and realize it was wrong and want to change, but that doesn't change their attraction.

   why is bpd so stigmatized???? there are ""worse"" disorders
  ","
  BPD is one of the most misunderstood personality disorders, although nearly all of them are stigmatized to a degree (especially ASPD). however, BPD ranges in severity, much like most other mental illnesses -- and it's also one with the highest mortality rates.
  
  idk why it's stigmatized to begin with, probably because those who are diagnosed with BPD or suspected of having BPD are deemed to be ""manipulative"" in light of their self destructive tendencies, but it only hurts the survivor even more in the long run.
  "
416997,"
   what about sxxual abxsers? cuz in my opinion, some abxse is worse than others. emotional and physical abxse, while still awful don't get me wrong, is still a lot more forgivable than sxxual abxse and i feel like they shouldn't be given the chance to change in that situation.
  ","
  i don't think abvse is a competition -- regardless of whether it's physical, verbal, or sxxual abvse, it's still abvse and deserves punishment through imprisonment.
  
  whether or not something is forgivable, that's entirely up to the survivor. there's no right or wrong way for a survivor to learn how to effectively cope with their abvse, and some survivors choose to forgive their abvsers while others don't -- and that's perfectly okay. every case of abvse is individualized and unique, which is why it's impossible to really say that *all* abvsers can be forgiven or can be changed.

417095,"
   Do you study and do your assignments last minute? If not then how do keep on top of things?
  ","
  when i was in school, i seldom studied -- it was always easy for me to retain material through listening in class and taking notes, and often i would rewrite my notes when i was on a break or at home to make them more organized, which led to further understanding of the material.
  
  i never really completed assignments last minute, though. if there was one thing college taught me, it was to do assignments as soon as possible because you don't know when things would pile up and become overwhelming. it also made me feel a lot better when i got assignments done early.
  "

  i prefer learning in a classroom, although admittedly i've never taken online classes before so i honestly don't know how i would do with learning at home.
  
  i think i would get too distracted at home, though. when i'm in a classroom, i'm there for the intended purpose and it's easier to get into the mindset of education when you're in that sort of environment.

417099,"
   If your other half did something that upset you, and continued to do it even after you told her it upsets you, how would you feel?

  that would upset me a lot because it means they're not respecting your feelings. if you told them that something they're doing is hurting you, then ideally they should try their best to stop that behavior out of respect for you.
  
  this is really vague though, and it ultimately depends on the specific circumstance. also if she's cognizant of whether or not she's actually doing that behavior. sometimes people aren't aware of their actions and need a hard reality check before they understand the implications of their actions.

   How to help someone with low self esteem? My sister and my boyfriend both have this problem and I've been reading some articles over the net about this matter, but I'd like to ask you as well Leigh.
  ","
  just support them in their endeavors -- if they express uncertainty about something, remind them of how valuable they are and capable of doing anything they set their mind to, and remind them of their successes in the past.
  
  it's difficult to really help people who have low self esteem because the problem comes from within, and it's mostly a solitary journey. people gain self esteem over time with confidence and self-actualization, but it helps when you have friends/family/etc. to support you along the way and recognize your true nature and potential.

417108,"
   What is the formula of happiness?

  everyone's formula for happiness is different depending on what they like & what makes them most comfortable.

  sorta along the same lines, but just because you have a college education doesn't guarantee that you'll get a good job or that all jobs are automatically ""better"" than jobs you can get without a degree. going back to my best friend who's a store manager -- she earns a salary, i don't. she earns more than i do, and she doesn't have a college education.
  
  things aren't always cut and dry like society wants you to believe. it's unfortunately drilled into our skulls that we *must* get a college education or else we won't go far in life, but that couldn't be further from the truth. there are so many different paths a person can take.

  honestly, i'll never understand these anons' obsession with your life (or anyone's life in general). it makes me wonder how horribly insecure they are about their own lives, education, job prospects, families, etc etc. obviously their acting out means something, and it usually stems from the fact that they're unhappy about their own lives -- so they take that aggression out on other people.

  there's nothing wrong with hourly waged jobs -- most jobs these days are paid hourly, unless you work for a corporation and have at least a bachelor's degree, but even so, not all corporations pay their employees a salary either.
  
  sometimes a salary can be a bad thing, which is the way i've always rationalized it to myself -- even though you're guaranteed x amount of dollars per week, that also means that you won't get paid any extra for overtime. if you're paid on an hourly basis, you get paid extra if you go over 40 hours per week.

  that includes myself as well. today, there was an email chain sent out to thousands of schools & corporations saying that there was a bomb in the building and to pay someone in bitcoin so that it won't detonate. my company didn't receive the email itself, but we did receive a warning from HR saying what it was, and i read it for two minutes, shook my head, and deleted the email. that's a bit scary to me.

  everyone has different strengths, and it's fundamentally wrong to judge a person based on something that isn't one of their strengths and make an overall judgment on that person because of that one facet of who they are. just because someone isn't good at one specific thing doesn't mean that they're not excellent at other things, and to judge a person wholly on that one area is doing them a disservice.

   Are parents ultimately responsible for the behavior or actions of their children?At what age does the blame shift to the child and not the parent?
  ","
  parents are responsible for setting a good example for their children and teaching them right vs. wrong from an early age. the way you behave as a parent or adult reflects entirely on your child, and they'll learn from your ways in some form or another. if a child misbehaves, then often it's a reflection of either the way the child was raised or what they witnessed growing up, and that is partially the parents' fault. acting out at a very young age is an indication of an unhappy home life.
  
  however, when the child gets older, the blame does shift from the parents more onto the individual child -- i would say teenage years would be around the time that the teenager's actions don't necessarily reflect the way they're raised, although there is still a strong positive correlation between a dysfunctional home life & the teenager acting out.

   my grandmother is on SSI and she barely receives enough for her bills + medication and they literally gave her $12 in food stamps cuz her income was “”too much”” then decided to shut it off altogether cuz again, it was too much. disability is honestly a joke imo.
  ","
  i agree, but sometimes it's also the only option people have. and the thing about SSD/SSI is that they're so hard to actually receive unless you have a condition that meets a listing or you have substantial medical evidence, it's such a small percentage of people who actually win their cases.

417251,"
   not to mention, claiming disability can take up to 2 years or more. realistically speaking, my bf is supposed to be on disability, but they were only going to give him $400 a month and that’s not even close enough to live off of for anyone with bills.
  ","
  you're exactly right. the timeline to obtain disability benefits can take up to 3-4 years depending on which circuit you're in. that's assuming you were denied upon the initial application stage and had to wait for a hearing.
  
  even so, the supplemental income is so low that its exactly what it sounds like -- supplemental. often those who receive disability benefits also are on medicare, food stamps, etc etc.
  "

   mentally disabled people cannot be that productive at work and may cause company loss. look at yourself and how many times you call out of work
  ","
  that's not true at all. there are millions of people who have mental illness and are able to succeed in a work environment.
  
  when i was untreated, i called out of work often. however, since i've been in treatment and have made progress with my mental health, i rarely call out of work. that doesn't mean my mental illnesses miraculously disappeared, though. i just learned to handle them better with the help of therapy and medication.
  
  in addition, the technical definition of disability, in legal terms, is a physical or mental condition that precludes you from sustaining work activity. if someone is disabled due to mental illness, then yeah -- they won't be able to work. that's when disability benefits come into play.

  inequality is bad because it puts people in positions that are undeserving, especially when it comes to those who have already struggled with oppression for centuries.

  i'm certain they actually believe it. all of the racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/ableist people i've come across actually believe that people are inferior to them or weaker individuals because they're a different race, sex, sexuality, or gender than them. there are people out there who genuinely believe that those with physical or mental disabilities aren't deserving of equal compassion or understanding.

417265,"
   Which areas in American society is inequality getting better?
  ","
  i think most areas in general, but like i said, it all depends on your perspective. things like racism, women's rights, lgbt rights, and mental health awareness are shedding more light and becoming better, but at the same time, there is also injustice related to all of them due to various stigmas, systems of oppression, and cases of violence.

  they were likely raised in an environment that was racist and adopted those views around them.

   Is inequality increasing in American society?
  ","
  depends on what kind of inequality you're talking about, and which perspective you look at it from. in some areas, inequality is more prevalent, but in other areas, it's getting better.
  
  i.e. racism in america. obviously things are a lot better than they were 50 years ago, but there has still been so much injustice, racism, and inequality the past 5-10 years that it's impossible to overlook. there's still a hell of a lot of racism in today's society.

  i don't know if i would necessarily break up with them immediately, but i would definitely have an issue with a relationship if my significant other started using their mental health issues as an excuse to be manipulative, cruel, or vindictive.
  
  like i stated in my previous answer, i believe people have the capability to change. but if my significant other doesn't believe that their behavior is wrong, and they're not receptive to conversations regarding the topic, then i may consider breaking up with them. especially if they start being cruel or manipulative towards me.

   Do you think empathy can be taught? Why/why not?
  ","
  i'm not entirely sure. for the most part, empathy is an innate trait from my experience, and if someone doesn't experience empathy, they're usually so disconnected from that emotion (and usually for such a long time) that it seems impossible to develop a sense of empathy.
  
  at the same time, however, i also believe people can change if they recognize their behavior or feelings are toxic, problematic, hurtful, etc etc., and take the necessary steps to resolve their problems and actively work toward being a better person.

   Complete: I wish I wasn't...
  ","
  i wish i wasn't mentally ill sometimes. my anxiety prevents me from doing ordinary, daily tasks sometimes, which puts strain on my relationships with my family and friends because sometimes i'm too anxious to even leave my house because of my fear of driving.
  
  in regards to BPD, my mood swings are exhausting and vary within a matter of minutes to hours, and they're never consistent. they've gotten remarkably better since i started taking a mood stabilizer, but it still exists to a degree. in addition, i'm also extremely sensitive to what people say to me, especially my loved ones, and i automatically assume they hate me if they express even a hint of disappointment or disagreement with me.

  i'm sorry you went through this, friend. it's difficult when a parent berates you like that because they're supposed to look out for you and advocate for you, not belittle you and alienate you.

  i think it entirely depends on the couple. your friend's relationship may seem fast to an outsider, but perhaps they do have a wild chemistry that makes their progression make sense to them because they connect on such an intimate level.
  
  i've also known some people who moved fast in relationships, but again, it all depends on the relationship itself as there's no universal way of determining milestones in relationships. some people take longer than others, but as long as both people are comfortable with their progression and it feels right to them, then that's all that really matters.

  lust and love are two different entities. lust can be described as a strong s*xual desire for someone, while love doesn't necessarily have any connection with sex at all. most of the time, love occurs without interference from lust.

   pull out works lol just like being on the pill of course there are risks but it works
  ","
  just because you've been lucky with the pull out method doesn't mean it works. people can still get pregnant from pre-c*m so there's just as much of a risk there than if someone didn't pull out. the pill is around 99% effective, while pulling out definitely is not. there's a reason no doctors recommend it as an effective means of birth control.

   opinion on people who use pull out as birth control?
  ","
  the pull out method is ineffective, and those who actually use it as their only means of birth control don't have a genuine understanding of sex and pregnancy.
  
  you can still get pregnant by pulling out. you can get pregnant even if the male doesn't finish. there's still viable sperm in pre-c*m and i've known people who got pregnant off of it.

  it depends entirely on the relationship. some people break up over that while others stay in the relationship but work out some sort of compromise.

  "
417581,"
   Do you think it'd be fair for your bf to break up with you if he was unsatisfied?

  i would be upset, but also understanding -- if sex is a component of your relationship and you two can't compromise on something that works in the bedroom, then i think it would be valid to split with your partner in an effort to find someone with which you're more compatible.
  
  sex isn't everything in a relationship, but it is important to some, if not most, people. and if sex is important to you then you need a partner who's on the same page as you.

  ","
  she isn't rejecting you & her intentions aren't selfish by any means. you shouldn't feel obligated to have sex if you're not in the mood, and considering her low sex drive, it's difficult to really get in the mood to have sex. to have sex when you don't want to is practically rxpe.
  
  i understand the situation is frustrating, but she isn't doing this purposely and i can guarantee that she wishes her sex drive was higher. talk to her about this if it's upsetting you, and maybe you two can find a solution.

  contrary to what family means to me, friends mean the world to me. they've been more of a family to me than my family itself, and i'm so grateful for the friendships i've developed over the years.
  
  ideally, friends should be loyal to you (and vice versa), be willing to help you when you're struggling, and be a source of comfort and escape when too much is going on. your friends shouldn't sugarcoat things to make you happy & be real with you, and you don't need to talk every day to maintain a friendship. you also have to understand that everyone is living their own life and it doesn't mean the friendship is weak at all.

  depends on the context. if it's uncalled for on somewhere like social media where grammar doesn't really matter, it might be construed as rude -- especially if it's out of the blue.

  no, i definitely don't think it's ok for a 15 year old to be with, let alone married to, a 40 year old.
  
  regardless of how mature the teenager thinks they are, they're still a child. they're not emotionally or physically mature enough to be with an adult, and its a classic case of emotional manipulation on the adult's part. those children are being groomed.
  
  i don't have to go into the reasons why a 40 year old shouldn't be with a child, that explains itself. that's pxdophilia and anyone who is attracted to a child should be in prison indefinitely.

   YouTubers who make videos on true crime cases, Do you think they're doing good or doing wrong? Many think that they're doing good due to spreading awareness and many think they're doing wrong due to it 'being disrespectful'. What do you think and why? Do you think it differs case to case?

  i only watch the true crime episodes put out by buzzfeed unsolved, but i think they're incredibly informative.

   Has your childhood experiences contributed to your impulsivity?

  lmao.
  
  for as long as i could remember, yes. i've always been the type to do things on a whim, whether it's something as simple as cutting my hair or something more severe. even though i'm medicated now, i still have episodes of erratic impulsivity when it comes to drinking.

417787,"

  when i was 19-20 years old ?? for the most part, yeah. those were the partying stages of my life and everyone knew not to fuck with me.
  "
417788,"
   Impulsive in what way do you mean?
  ","
  usually my impulsive episodes mean i'm cutting myself, threatening to kill myself, drinking to the point where i'm blacking or putting myself in danger, or getting so high that i don't know where i am or who i'm with.
  "
417789,"
   If you could stay the same age forever, what age would you stay at?

417796,"
   In your opinion, how do you know you're in love with someone? Is it instant? Gradual? What makes you fall for someone?

  i think it's gradual, personally. you have to put the time in to get to truly know someone, otherwise you're falling in love with the idea of them and not who they actually are.

Do you think mentally ill people who have depression or ptsd or who are just extremely suicidal should be allowed assisted suicide?

  no, i don't support that. people who are svicidal aren't terminally ill and there are treatment modalities to dramatically increase the value of life for people who are contemplating svicide.
  
  i think assisted svicide should only be used in cases of severe terminal illness, where a person has a determinable amount of time to live.

  no, i don't believe in soul mates -- at least not in the traditional sense. i believe that there are dozens of people with which someone can be compatible completely, not just one person. i also believe that it isn't always in a romantic context either.

  i know it isn't the most wild day, but it's something that makes me incredibly happy.
  "
417829,"
   So how do you know your seretonin levels are low if they can't be measured?
  ","
  because i benefit from antidepressants, which target serotonin & dopamine levels and ""even them out"" so to speak. therapy alone wouldn't help me, i need psychiatric medication.
  "
417830,"
   Yes I have, and like everyday. But he keeps being distant and keeps ignoring me everytime. That's why I didn't know what to, he's not giving me any opportunity.
  ","
  i'm sorry that you guys are going through this. :/ that sounds like a difficult situation, especially if he's constantly blocking you out and isolating himself. that isn't healthy either.
  
  if i was in that position, i would honestly keep trying. don't bother him every day because that can be overwhelming and don't suffocate him, but send him messages telling him that you support him and that you're always there for him. he can talk to you when he's ready and you're not going to leave, that sort of thing. hopefully he'll come around.

  ","
  i mainly do overtime at work (which isn't exactly overtime, it's just me doing work for the company at home on weekends), but my prime motivation behind that is to make money.
  
  i always feel guilty about taking sick days, though. even though i have a doctor's note excusing absences due to mental illness, i'm still terrified they're going to fire me one day even though i only take off perhaps one day per month for legitimate reasons.
  "
417839,"
   How have you been feeling these days?

  it depends entirely on the day at this point. yesterday, i felt terrible, and today, i feel a bit better but my anxiety has been skyrocketing. the weather doesn't help at all in this case either.
  "
417840,"
   Do you seek revenge? Let’s say your partner cheated on you, would you cheat on them too?
  ","
  no, i wouldn't cheat on him if he ended up cheating on me. it doesn't help the situation at all, and if such an event were to happen, i would just leave. revenge in such a manner only hurts everyone involved even more and further complicates things.

  i eat healthy most of the time, and my diet mainly consists of lean meats for protein, a lot of vegetables, and a small serving of carbs with dinner meals. i also drink water and green tea often.

   Have you ever worked a customer service job, where you've been treated as subhuman because of the job you do? Was it one of those places where management expected you to adopt an 'Customer is always right' mentality? Has working such jobs given you a misanthropic attitude towards the human species?
  ","
  i worked in retail in various customer service positions for many years when I was younger, and every day a customer would basically treat me as if i wasn't a human being with feelings and a life. i've been brought to tears and had panic attacks due to those experiences.
  
  management mostly abided by the worker, although we did try the whole ""customer is always right"" thing as much as we could via legalities and policies. i was cynical about the human race before working in retail, but those experiences probably made it much worse, lol.

417917,"
   Leigh, what’s new in your life in the several months since we last talked? Ask me things as well.
  ","
  nothing new has really happened -- i've just been working a lot, seeing friends, etc etc. my birthday just passed (on the 18th), so i celebrated with my boyfriend and some friends, and i spent thanksgiving at my boyfriend's house with his family, which was really fun.
  
  i've been feeling more motivated too, which is a nice change. the past year has been difficult in regards to my mental health, but i'm steadily stabilizing myself as long as i remember to take my medication every day.
  "

  i mainly watch achievement hunter, rooster teeth, markiplier, chilledchaos, videogamedunkey, and seananners (when he was still active).
  "
417919,"
   What has been the worst advice you have been given?
  ","
  ""you can't love someone else if you don't love yourself first.""
  
  i used to believe in it, sadly enough. i didn't think i was capable of truly loving another human being because i didn't love myself. over time, i realized that it was mainly a power trip for the person who told this to me, and i learned that people are fully capable of loving another person even if they still have issues within themselves.
  
  in addition, the idea of a person not being able to love someone else if they don't love themselves is harmful to people who struggle with self worth because it makes them further believe that they're not worthy of love either.
  "
417920,"
   How adventurous are you? Don't have to be going out on trips, it can be being adventurous inside your mind.
  ","
  i would say that i'm fairly adventurous. i'm not afraid to take risks, and occasionally i'll dive out of my comfort zone, especially if i know something is only temporary. in addition, i like garnering new experiences because i believe life should be composed of great experiences.
  "
417921,"
   How of often do you try to find new ideas to do in your spare time?
  ","
  tbh i work best with a routine, so my daily/weekly routine seldom changes. my days consist of coffee, work, checking up on social media, video games, and occasionally reading and writing.
  
  here and there, my routine is punctuated with events, such as going out with friends, but i generally stick to the same things.
  "
417922,"
   Do you believe people can be changed?
  ","
  i believe that people can change, yes -- however, they have to 1) recognize that their behavior was hurtful and problematic, and 2) genuinely want to make a difference within themselves.
  
  unfortunately, a lot of people can't change because they're too stubborn or proud to admit that they were wrong. nevertheless, there are definitely people out there who have the capacity to change.

   Are you known to be romantic amongst your friends? Like do you show affection in public
  ","
  no, i don't show affection in public toward my friends ... i don't really show affection to them in private, either. i'll tell my friends that i'm thankful for their friendship, but that's the extent of it. i feel uncomfortable showing physical affection.
  "
417977,"
   What do you think should happen to people who make false claims, like the women with the Bret Kavanaugh case.

  people who make false accusations should be met with discipline -- perhaps not as severely as people who actually do the offense, but there should be some form of punishment involved.

417978,"
   What does a female seek in a man?

  there's nothing in a man that will complete a woman, so the answer is nothing. women are whole human beings and don't need the validation of men to survive & thrive.

417979,"
   Are you romantic?
  ","
  i have tendencies to be pretty romantic, yes !! i prefer staying inside, having deep conversations, and connecting intimately with my partner as opposed to going out somewhere. i really value sentimental thoughts and gifts more than anything else.

  "
417983,"
   Which is easier for you to be heart broken or break a heart?
  ","
  i feel things too deeply, so i feel as if breaking someone else's heart would personally be easier for me. i have a tendency to ruminate on things for a long time, and normally if i'm breaking a person's heart, i've already disconnected from them emotionally so it wouldn't hurt me as much as if i got my heart broken.
  "
417984,"
   Do you like talkative people or do you find them annoying?
  ","
  it depends on their personality. i have a friend who's pretty talkative, but she's also fun to talk to so it doesn't bother me at all.

  i went to bed around 1:30am and woke up at 8:30am.

  however, i will say this in a general sense -- you have to remember that you did break up for a reason, and unless you have reasonable cause to believe that the relationship will be different now, the turnout may end up being the same. most of the time, it isn't worth it to return to your exes because you both might be hurt again in the long run.

   What is the meaning of happiness!!????
  ","
  happiness is a state of contentment and joy that an individual feels, whether it's temporarily or on a long term basis. happiness is also subjective, meaning that its meaning depends entirely on the individual, and different things make different people happy.

   How often are you re-asked your own question/s?

  i don't ask questions anymore, so never.

418013,"
   Everyone has flaws, it's what makes us human.

  i wholeheartedly agree. that doesn't really change how i view a person who has significantly wronged me, however. if someone does something terribly wrong to myself or someone else, then i don't see anything redeeming about them anymore.

  no, quite the opposite. ever since he took office, more and more racist, sexist,homophobic, transphobic, etc etc. people are coming out and being more open with their hatred -- because trump has, whether knowingly or not, made it a safer place for these ignorant people to exist and express their hatred.

  ","
  it depends on the circumstance. some people have easy lives while other people have harder lives. it isn't really a universal thing.
  "
418016,"
   So basically you see the best in people until you realize that they're only human (not perfect) then all you can see is their mistakes?
  ","
  in a way, yeah -- although when i say that they've done something wrong, it isn't usually something as easy as a silly mistake. it usually happens when they've made a big mistake or have wronged someone (whether it's myself or someone i know), and then all i can see in them are their flaws, which are unforgiving.

   Hi , I was thinking about that question and your answer.  It made me wonder then, do you think then that when people blow up and act terribly its a choice, and cant just be accepted as ""that's just me""?
  ","
  there's a certain etiquette you need to follow when you're working with the general public, particularly in retail or food service positions, and unfortunately saying ""that's just me"" in response to something you might have done that offends a customer won't fly with management and may risk your job.
  
  personally speaking, if a customer is acting irrationally and heated and making personal offenses toward the workers, then it's forgiveable to defend yourself against the customer. you have to remind others that you're human too. but that doesn't give anyone permission to personally criticize a customer because then you're acting just as poorly as the customer is.
  "
418038,"
   Do you ever see your friends who work in retail or wherever, being nice to customers and laugh because you know that's not the real them? ?
  ","
  I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME LOL.
  
  especially considering my background in retail. i worked in retail for four years, and i dealt with hundreds of customers per week and i strangely never lost my cool. however, i'm actually pretty quick to anger and things irritate me easily, so whenever someone saw me deal with an irate customer, they would be confused as to how i was still so nice to them.
  
  same thing with my boyfriend. he's a very blunt, honest, no bullshit sort of person but he's been working in retail for years now, particularly in positions where he needs to put the customers' priorities first. it always amazes me that he hasn't snapped yet.

  if i want to make a new resolution, then realistically i can start it at any time. waiting for the new year is just giving yourself an excuse to postpone the changes you need to make. if you really set your mind to making a change, there's nothing stopping you from beginning those changes now.

   What are the qualities in boys you put in the friendzone?
  ","
  technically, all of the men in my life are in the ""friendzone"" because i'm in a relationship already.
  
  the ""friendzone"" is just a bullsh*t excuse that men give when a woman rejects their advances, though. there's really no ""friendzone,"" you just have to learn to accept the meaning of no if someone doesn't want to date you.

   Have you ever had to deal with death, whether it’s a person or a pet? How did you handle it?
  ","
  unfortunately, i've had to deal with death often in my life, referring to both people and animals.
  
  i put up a strong front at the wake and funeral services, but i have a tendency to break down in private after everything has calmed down. the last time i witnessed a death, i didn't cry in the waiting room because i felt like i had to be a source of strength for everyone else, but as soon as we got home, i broke down.

   Do you prefer real or fake/artificial flowers?
  ","
  i don't have a preference. i don't really like receiving flowers as a gift, even though i do appreciate the sentiment behind them. artificial flowers obviously last longer, but real flowers are usually prettier. it doesn't much matter to me.

  no, i don't. i don't generally like xmas as a holiday, but i *do* enjoy buying and giving people gifts to open on the holidays.
  
  i haven't even started xmas shopping yet, though. i need to pay off some of my credit cards, and then i'll probably start shopping in 1-2 weeks.

   Is it grammatically incorrect to say ""I like to meet people that share the same interests""? Someone said it is and i should replace ""that"" with ""who"". English isn't my first language, I'm still learning and I appreciate when people correct me, it helps me improve.
  ","
  the person you asked is correct -- you're referring to the people in that construction, so it should go ""...who share the same interests.""
  
  if the noun you were referring to was a thing, you could use ""that."" i.e. ""i like to collect toys that remind me of my childhood.""

  thanksgiving is less than a week away, & i have no clue what i'm doing, lmaoo.
  
  there's an 85 percent chance i'm seeing my boyfriend's family this year, though. last year, we ate dinner at my house, so it's only fair for us to see his family this year. we just don't know if the rest of his family is going to be around.

418330,"
   Why don't you identify as a feminist anymore?
  ","
  there's a lot of disregard for new wave feminists in online communities, and i don't feel comfortable adhering the label of ""feminist"" to myself because unfortunately people didn't take me seriously when i prefaced my opinions with the idea that i was a feminist. white and liberal feminism is pretty much the face of feminism these days, and their core beliefs don't define what i believe or what i am. i don't want to associate myself with that form of the movement.
  
  i still have many of the same beliefs as i did when i labeled myself as an intersectional feminist, but i just don't throw the label around anymore.
  "
418331,"
   Is money everything in a relationship between a bf and gf or husband and wife
  ","
  absolutely not. if your relationship is based exclusively on money, then your relationship is empty and foundation-less. there's so much more that goes into relationships than how each partner handles their finances. in my opinion, it's pretty shallow to date someone *solely* because they make a lot of money.

   Have you had a good life you think
  ","
  i don't recall my childhood, so i can't objectively say whether or not that part of my life was good or bad. i simply can't remember anything prior to the age of 11/12.
  
  my teenagehood was extremely difficult, and if it wasn't for the support of two specific friends, i wouldn't have survived. i endured a lot of abvse, which has even altered my behavior as an adult.
  
  after the age of 20 and beyond, my life has been substantially better. i've had good opportunities and i've worked my a*s off to make money and obtain a good education. i have a good job and an amazing support system, and things can only look up from here.

  "
418337,"
   Is it more important to love or be loved?
  ","
  i think they're equally important in different ways. it's important to love because love inspires us and gives us reason to continually grow, and it's often our love for others that motivates us to continue pushing forward.
  
  however, it's also important to be loved because we deserve to feel loved, cared for, and appreciated -- especially if we're going through a particularly hard time. support, validation, and unconditional love are integral to a person's development.
