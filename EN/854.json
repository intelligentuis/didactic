biggest interest . it wasnt until i was like that my life took a different direction . christina my oldest sister wanted to be in a band but it wasnt working out with her friends . my mom has a degree in music and vocals so we were all taught how to sing from a very young age . originally . . . . it was just me and amy and christina who started a band at the time but it didnt really take off at first . in that when my mom suggested we just started a band as a sibling group since our schedules were all the same and we lived together . the band consisted of our brother michael , christina , katherine , lisa , amy and me . dani was to little at the time to join . we all took musical theater as well so we knew the basically foundations and kinda picked up on playing instruments the further we went . our grandmother used to book us gigs at nursing homes as well at the time . when danielle was a little bit older she joimed the band and michael eventually backed out from being a member but still helps with the sound and technically things for our concerts and what not today . growing up i wasnt really motivated or focused on actually being a singer and it took a long conversation with christina to actually get me to stay motivated and focused on music . i just thought it was never going to work out but then kath suggested we post a cover on youtube of party in the head which went viral at the time . . . and left us shook . . . so we kept doing more and more which more views kept coming . . . etc . you can read more about it . . . but i think i really realized that i wanted to be a singer around the age of when i decided to go to college and realized i was basically wasting my time because i already had a career that i had since i was . . . and i m just doing extra work for basically nothing . . . and was really stressed out . there were times when i wanted to quit the band but thank god we took therapy sessions and we are all in a good place now . . .","790300":"she had

based on who i like love date or even am friends with . being told if i m girlfriend that he is a cheater , and hes going to cheat on me and hurt me just the same as the others . i really think its messed up . i have feelings to , and he always been my entire world amd has always meant alot to me even when we were just friends . so for people to come after me because i choose to love him is wrong . i never once have been disrespected by him or even hurt by him . when i was down he was the first one to check on me and ask if i was okay . he was always there to talk to and lean on when i do desperately needed it . . . . so its really wrong you guys believe a tea page just literally digs and digs for one little thing to cause drama out of . the other girls involved love the drama . . . other ones had no clue about it . . . but were directly out into these allegations even though there was literally nothing said on their behalf . y all just want to believe a drama tea page instead of the actual person or an ex girlfriend that loves the attention and making up stuff for clout . the other ex said it was ages ago meaning it may or may not have been that person you assume is a cheater . and just because they no longer follow eachother doesnt necessarily mean the claims are true . it could be just to get away from the drama or try to just let it fade over time . no one really knows . but it literally hurts recievinf those messages saying if i m him girlfriend hes going to do the same thing to me . another topic that s super annoying , the roadies . . . . some of them not all . . . . but give the other guy a break hes been through a lot as well with allegations being thrown at him to basically having to adjust to not having a member he spent tons of time with leave and another one joining shortly after . . . i know how i felt when lisa was home sick and we were on tour and ahe wasnt rhere beside me i literally was wanting to cry every second . . . but the nonstop hate and disrespect towards all of them need to stop . they work so hard to try to give everyone what they want and expect to make them happy the best they can . . . and going to a show that they have worked so hard on to do and just try to make it a grest fun night for everyone and being a total fake is wrong . literally calling yourself a roadie . the boys may or may not have made a mistake , but theyre humans , we all make mistakes get over it . but if you re just going to their shows , listening to their music etc . just to pull up and allegation about them cheating on and change the lyrics to the song you are not a true roadie because a true roadie would not even think about pulling that card . and if that is your intention and you still are calling yoirself a true roadie i advise not to go a show , listen to their music , or even mention their names because the boys do not deserve any of this or to be loved by fake fans or any negativity . they deserve happiness and love","790490":"then out of the girls its christina me katherine dani lisa me amy ? ? maybe christina me lisa and christina dani katherine","790491":"no i was gonna say langela who ? ! ? don t know her","790492":"not sure

the church or a place that has clean water . so i was super cautious when it came to this and even took the precaution . but i ended up falling really sick when we came back to the usa and i went to

was inspired to write the song which also kinda ties in with how she was feeling at the time . acid rain i wrote about a boy who was just way to toxic and eventually broke my heart and no matter what

which is why so many people are the way they are because everyone assumes they know what that person is going through or theyre ignorant like you and push them way to far that they actually hurt themselves ! ! its not a flipping joke . depression , mental illness , bullying all these factors into self harm and insecurities . instead of being rude and ignorant and telling people the world would be better without them in it or theyre freaks because of what they do why not show some kindness , support and love ? why not even try to see her perpective of life ? im nkt saying self harming is definitely the answer but neither is sending hate to someone you don t exactly know personally . i m so sorry alot of you recieve such hurtful rude comments like this . . . and if you ever need someone to talk to i m always here to listen and help . i hope things get better and you can be happy once again . never be afraid to ask for help at your darkest times because there are a lot of

it s causing you to hyper focus on something important that s coming up so you can be prepared . rather than not being stressed , i try to just put it into perspective . how important is this really ? and why does it seem like such a big deal ? what really matters to me ? when i put whatever i m stressed about in context with the rest of my life , i m able to tone it down a few notches , but usually am still at least a little bit stressed if it s something important to me .","790829":"why are a bunch of foreign people which seem like they are russian on the leaderboard ? ? for the usa ?
