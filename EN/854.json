Y'all can lie all you want but as soon as one of their \"people that they claim they are\" come forward and expose their relationship suddenly that person they're \"dating\" disappears and their focus is on who the person been talking to the entire time. Kian let's pull all the receipts up k... Because I know kian Personally unlike you guys. Back in 2011, Kian Lawley was rumored dating Jenn McAllister. The rumors swirled around when he tweeted I Love You to her in his Twitter account in August 2011. The two went out for a couple of years and then broke up.\n  \n  According to rumors, Jenn\u2019s friend, Andrea Russett was responsible for their breakup. Andrea Russett is also an actor and YouTuber like her. After Kian met Andrea, they started hanging out. They also did a lot of collaborative videos on their channel. The duo began dating each other back in 2013 and decided to go separate ways in June 2014. Fans came to know about their break up through her social media. She made a public announcement on Twitter that the pair were no longer together. The fans were devastated to hear the news, but they were happy to know that they were still friends. Following the break up with Andrea, Kian started hooking up with Alexandria Schneck. She posted a screenshot of her messages with him in which he complimented her tattoos. After that, she posted a picture of them together lying in bed on her snapchat.\n  \n  It wasn\u2019t confirmed what happened between Kian and Alexandria, but the two suddenly stopped seeing each other. In late 2016, Kian started dating model, Meredith Mickelson. Their relationship with each other wasn\u2019t confirmed until her sister went on social media to talk about how her sister was a better girlfriend to him than Andrea.\n  \n  Before Kian, Meredith was in a relationship with Ethan Dolan. Kian and Meredith started dating in 2016. Their relationship was criticized as she was underage. In October, she posted a photo of them kissing in New York City. In April 2017, the couple decided to call it quits and went their separate ways. The two hasn\u2019t been in touch since then.\n  \n  Kian Lawley is currently in a relationship with his girlfriend, Ayla Woodruff. They have been together since early 2019 and are still blissfully in a relationship!! Kian was single for those time periods and olivia o brien and him never dated the end\n  ","917058":"\n  LOML\n  ","917059":"\n  Milk then cereal\n  ","917060":"\n  Awe I would try to help if u needed\n  ","917061":"\n  Thats good, still having writers block?\n  ","917062":"\n  Summerrr\n  ","917063":"\n  A shout out feature?\n  ","917064":"\n  Yours?\n  ","917065":"\n  Gotta come here\n  ","917066":"\n  Cupid\n  ","917067":"\n  Mhm\n  ","917068":"\n  I gotta give u something though\n  ","917069":"\n  Its going good\n  ","917070":"\n  Cal someone to have them excorted from the premises\n  ","917071":"\n  Its fine I'm okay for now x\n  ","917072":"\n  My relationship\n  ","917073":"\n  No I don't....
