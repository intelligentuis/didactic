everytime we tried to talk or work things out it would always result in am argument and none of us were ever satisfied or truly happy . and i ve come to the realization that no matter how much effort or whatever you put into something that you re not always going to get exactly what you want . and that s what was going on . i was inlove with him but he didnt feel the same way about me anymore and he moved on while i was still holding onto something that wasnt meant to be . and i m glad he found someone who he loves and they love him back . eventually i ll find my forever person or someone who i love just as much and get the same respect and that back . somethings just aren t meant to be or isnt the right time and i think for me and tristen although i loved him it just wasnt the right time or place and who knows what may happen in the future . i have no hard feelings towards him at all and wish him the best . but right now i m focused on myself . my career and doing what i want to and having a path i want to follow along . i m totally fine with us being friends or just checking on eachother but i dont see us being together ever again","760809":"ofc","760810":"what about
