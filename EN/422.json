and licking his fingers clean .","391170":"they also said that veganism is a lifestyle but everything that they said , just shows the political side of it instead","391171":"i don t believe so","391172":"plant based foods including fruit , vegetables , grains , beans , nuts , and seeds . vitamin d and d from lichen are vegan alternatives . cant have grains , beans with doing keto . fruit

intake i can t have oats i d get sick of smoothie bowls chia seeds and flax wouldn t cut it for me we have i mention alternatives and you go off lol i m losing weight is the only thing i mentioned .

.","391173":"how old are you ?","391174":"i love animals . there s also other ways of helping . i really don t see how i could do vegan and keto together . i don t like tempah , i can t have honey ,

like what would i eat ? urlsareshittbh they make great vegan meals but at the same time i m like can t have that either lol also can t afford to buy all meat , cheese and other alternatives . good for

amount of time then do something else , come back to more studying . it s good to take breaks take notes , study from old tests if possible if it s a lot of reading , make a goal on how many pages to read over . break , more reading have the room be quiet or some low soothing music if its not a distraction review everything right before taking the exam so its fresh in your mind being tired
