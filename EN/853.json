Being sisters, we share a lot but we still fight our own battles. One struggle we all have in common is the journey of finding true self-love, compassion and self-worth. All five of us have struggled to find this. It\u2019s not something you easily gain, but just like any other relationship, your relationship with you is built in small actions on a daily basis. How would you treat a friend or a person you loved? How would you talk to them? What would you do for them to show your love? Love is about the little things: choosing to speak with compassion instead of criticism. Giving yourself the time you need to rest and recover. Choosing to see the good in yourself and believe you deserve to be loved. These are the small, daily actions that create self-love. #youreworthit\n  \n  \ud83d\udcf8\n  \n   @acaciaevans\n  \n","916036":"\n  Probably considering we opened a concert for them, went to a event that nick was at, met them backstage, went to a concert and got noticed for a cover\n  ","916037":"\n  Just cleaning and trying to figure some thing out\n  ","916038":"\n  I am\n  ","916039":"\n  Yeah I know...
