Today you're turning 26, 6 years ago I met you the first time and didn't realize the impact you would leave on my life or how close we would eventually come. I was young, very young and touring europe for probably the first time of my life but also dealing with a heartbreak that I thought would never heal completely. But something during those first few months started to change that. Even though it was eventually rye who I met. You grasped my attention at the right moment and we got to know eachother and become closer. You just knew right away how to make me smile, make me laugh and just over all knew me and actually understood without judgement.   Over time you became my best friend who I shared everything with, and i didn't realize i was falling in love with you as well during those moments. Our relationship wasn't always perfect, and we had our moments of arguments and avoidance from time to time but after everything had calmed down. We found our ways back into each others life. And we both knew that no matter how hard we tried, we could never fully escape from eachothers lives and we would somehow always be connected. Maybe it was just the world telling us that we were special who really knows? But one thing I am for certain is I love you \ud83d\udc9c so happy birthday Ands!!
