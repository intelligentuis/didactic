The CS program (my intended major) at my university is super competitive and I already applied once and didn't get in and I can reapply, but honestly don't think I will get in with the grades I have.... I applied to a different school to transfer to and got in, but now the campus is closed so I can't check out the school... It's a few hours from home and I don't really like living at home, although I also have problems w\/ sadness and anxiety and being far away might make things harder to handle, idk... I would be far from my dr & counselor, for example. I thought about maybe trying an online school instead, but some say that employers aren't as likely to hire you then and also that would mean I have to stay at home... + The school I'm at now is known for their very good CS program, so I am worried about what opportunities I might lose by leaving the school. I'm afraid that if I go to this new school tho, the sadness and anxiety will just follow me there and finding\/making friends will be as difficult as it was at my current school, and all this will mess up my school life there too like it did here, and nothing will get better and I will feel even more isolated cus I'm in a foreign town. Rn, I'm taking a quarter off, but I have to decide if I'm gonna try this new university or not by May and it's just not a decision I feel prepared to make bc idk how things will be for me by August...at this rate, it doesn't feel like things will be any better by then and I don't wanna be struggling there as much as I did here...\n  ","944990":"\n  thank you for your kindness \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\u2764\ufe0f It's a lot, honestly.

I would rather be dead then consistently a failure like rn. How come some people can do so much wrong, but then still get to be happy and successful like nothing happened. How come some people get to naturally be the society's version of attractive, smart, pretty, fit or whatever, while others don't? Some people are set up to succeed more or easier than others.

I can't believe there's any kind of God or higher existance when I notice all this, no matter how hard I try, bc then that makes me feel as if that spirit is biased and doesn't care for me and many others, and that's just messed up.

Because of this, it's unethical for anyone to be telling others who to love and which loving is \"right\" and which is \"wrong,\" or discriminating against people who don't love who you think they should. Love is just love, there's nothing more to it. It can't hurt nobody, love is not danger, love is not from a rule book.... It's just love.
