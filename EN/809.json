I get cyber bullied and get shit about it from classmates. For example: i went to the pride center and as I was walking home I got called a \"Queer\" by just walking. Our pride center has been vandalized.\n  \n  So yes it isn't as popular as you think actually. People still do not like it. My parents and others including. Kids are still disowned and thrown out of the house, others commit suicide, ect.\n  ","868118":"\n  Well my bio literally says \"I'm taken.\" The amount of thirsty people I get on the daily, yeah imma be rude. I don't want anyone but my boyfriend. So\n  ","868119":"\n  Okay here's the deal:\n  \n  For years people who aren't straight have been silenced.

I was not allowed to be myself as we were pressed into a dress code of collared shirt, khaki pants, belt, close toed shoes, no weird hair, no shorts, dresses had to be collared, skirts went past knees, ect. So yeah when I realized I was pans I was immediately treated like shit by teachers and students alike. So now I can finally be myself and I am proud of my identity.\n  \n  So yes I did get upset when you literally disrespected my identity. That's like going up to a trans person and saying \"why are you so passionate about being trans? I'm straight and I am not that passionate for ffs\" that is literally disregarding someones IDENTITY. What you did was not right.\n  ","868120":"\n  Hi\n  ","868121":"\n  Daily questions? I don't do daily questions.

Not everyone is straight and not everyone had the same events and such as you. So you do need to grow up and you are an idiot by not acknowledging the differences. You shouldn't assume and all you're doing is making yourself seem like a bigger asshole.\n  \n  And I QUOTED you.
