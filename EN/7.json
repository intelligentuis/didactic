I knew they would of reopened either way but I still went for it, I wanted to try something different with the kiddo to see if it changed anything..maybe it was worth it and worked..\n  ","7670":"\n  I think depowering him is the best move but..*Reaper sighs* ..are you really that afraid of losing him?\n  ","7671":"\n  Love..*Reaper sighs*..okay..fine.. it actually wasn't from Socket though.. remember when I said the timelines I go reaping in can get dangerous? It happened while we were out.. I was trying to get Socket to do something else besides attacking and killing everyone in sight..thought maybe reaping Souls was a better alternative..that way he can still kind of kill things but in a good way, well..while he was busy reaping the monsters I told him to do, I had a couple problems with the locals.. *Reaper moves his robe aside slightly so Genos able to see his chest was covered in bl\u0153d* they kinda reopened the wounds I had from Cross.. and added onto them..\n  \n  *Geno is probably going to get scared whenever Reaper goes out reaping now lol*\n  ","7672":"\n  Yeah..I'm kinda surprised you of all people remembered that, you usually forget everything\n  ","7673":"\n  Sh-t..*Reaper now realizes he let that slip* Nothing Love, it's not that big of a deal, I just need some sleep and I'll be fine..\n  ","7674":"\n  How do you know about Inks job? *That honestly shocked Reaper since well, not all monsters or humans in their multiverse are, you know, self aware?*\n  ","7675":"\n  Geno..*Reaper sighs* Okay..... you got me, you have a point.. but I'll be okay now Love, my injury isn't as serious as yours--*he just admitted to being injured*\n  ","7676":"\n  Kiddo, I'm not saying he can't live I'm saying that I can't make it so he can live forever, I know he'll be weaker without his magic but I don't know how much weaker..he could still be strong enough to overpower you and dust everyone in sight..

A god? Don't make me laugh kiddo, just cause you look a little different than the other kiddos doesn't make you a God..wait what do you mean we..?\n  ","7697":"\n  ..*Reaper raises a non existent eyebrow* ..Why would a kiddo like you wanna greet Death?

I only did that when I had Hatred.. and that was out of my control.. even if it's \"boring\" to you, is having the whole world against you worth it?\n  \n  *it's confirmed by Renrink Reaper subconsciously locked away his emotions so he wouldn't get his feelings hurt anymore, that's why he comes off as cold and heartless even though he really isn't, it just took someone like Geno to get him to open up and show his feelings which confused Reaper since he's had his feelings locked away so long he doesn't know how to express them, and he has the same phobia as Error with being touched by strangers, only Reaper doesn't go to the extreme like Error does and can tolerate it better than he can, for example if you were to hug Error he would blast your arms off, if you hug Reaper, he'll be very uncomfortable but he won't murder you for it, I randomly found this out by browsing tumblr*\n  ","7714":"\n  I'm already happily married~\n  ","7715":"\n  Hey!

I thought he could use a break away from me.. *Reaper rubs his arm* a anon told me I was gonna cause him to fall down..actually a few told me that..so I'm keeping my distance for a bit.. at least until I know he's okay.. I need to ketchup on my reaping anyway..I've been really slacking off, more than usual..\n  ","8165":"\n  I doubt it but..maybe he actually feels bad about it and doesn't want you around so he can't hurt you again.. that's what I'd do anyway.. I'm sort of doing that right now.. *Reaper sighed* I went off reaping so Geno has a break away from me..\n  ","8166":"\n  Sounds to me like your lonely, but they can't help it, Dream has Nightmare on his tail and kiddos to take care of and Error.. he's just a d-che.. heII, he pepper sprayed me the other day, sure I might of deserved it but damn..\n  ","8167":"\n  ..You said that once before, when Holo had captured me..

What are you doing here?\n  ","8173":"\n  *Reaper scoots Zo out of their room and shuts the door, leaving Geno with Goth* tell me this then..what's a stranger doing here knocking on Deaths door? It better be damn important..\n  ","8174":"\n  That's how me and Geno started out, not in a cave but he started living at my house with me and traveled with me..same thing your both doing, pretty soon I'll hear that you both got married~ *He winks*\n  ","8175":"\n  Who the heII are you..? *Reaper was really shocked to see such a tall alien in their room*\n  ","8176":"\n  ..*Reaper teleports them both back home, setting Geno down on their bed*...\n  ","8177":"\n  He's not falling down!

A date sound good? I don't think anything is here to ruin it this time\n  \n  *Aside from the fact your nearly blind--*\n  \n  SHUT UP MOD!! I SAID NOTHING WILL RUIN IT THIS TIME!!\n  ","8182":"\n  *Reaper then clinks Geno on his cheek* The only reason I'm better is cause you made me better, I wouldn't be like this without you Love.. if you didn't convince me to come clean about my Hatred and everything.. I dunno what would of happened.. *The multiverse would have eventually been destroyed, probably*\n  ","8183":"\n  ..I..I dunno..guess I'm just used to being responsible for that kind of stuff happening..*Reaper then looks away from Geno*\n  ","8184":"\n  *Reaper looked confused for a moment*\n  \n  You talking about what happened earlier? I didn't think you overheard that.. you really think I didn't do anything?\n  \n  *he sounds shocked, it was unbelievable for him to hear that Geno or anyone really, wouldn't think he was responsible for that*\n  ","8185":"\n  *Anon Geno went anon lol*\n  \n  *Reaper blushed bright blue, he really didn't expect this*\n  \n  ..Uh..it's.. really not that bad Love, I'm fine but..it's really adorable your that worried about me *he then lays his skull on top of Genos* I don't want you worrying yourself to Death though.. so don't do it too much..\n  ","8186":"\n  *Lol**Reaper just smirks* I think you do, you turned as red as a tomato when I said you both were dating~\n  ","8187":"\n  Do I look like a kid to you? *Reaper gives you a glare with his scythe in his hands*\n  ","8188":"\n  Aw come on Love, eye can see you just fine *he winks* besides my eyes were already damaged anyway, it's not like this will hurt them any *You erased his memory of the anon telling him about your eyesight..just to end up tattling on yourself..your a idiot sometimes*\n  \n  ..sh-t..\n  ","8189":"\n  When I get the chance I will, I think Wendall and Wendy are off on a date or something right now *Reaper shrugs*\n  ","8190":"\n  *Reaper then sighs, he could tell under all that anger, Geno was really worried and avoiding the question wasn't going to help his worrying*\n  \n  ..Okay, okay.. it might of had something to do with what Error did but it shouldn't last long, I'll be back to normal soon, don't worry Love, we can still have fun~\n  ","8191":"\n  ..Those were pillows?

Can I just reap them?\n  ","8205":"\n  Well he was fighting me to let him go with his friend and making up sh-t about the world ending if he doesnt go, so..yeah.. pretty sure he wanted to, whoever it is must be pretty important to him, anyway how about we go get Gothy? I might need you to be my eyes for a bit..so you'll have to tell me where I'm going\n  \n  *Geno will find out on his own later*\n  ","8206":"\n  I forgot someone was actually dumb enough to ask that.. *probably because you reaped them right after they asked* okay, nothing is dumber to ask than that one\n  ","8207":"\n  *Reaper just bursts into laughter at the question, he almost falls over from laughing too much* I've had a lot of people ask me stupid sh-t but THIS has to be the dumbest one!\n  ","8208":"\n  *Reaper had blushed bright blue, Geno caught him by surprise again* Uh.. r-right, forgot about Gothy.. um..Love?

I can take a fight Love.. let me kick his a$$!\n  ","8213":"\n  Genos permanently injured, he can't help it! I'm surprised he can do half the stuff he does as is! I think it's amazing he can do anything while like that and you shouldn't complain about helping your own brother when he needs it! If you think your more \"magically and physically\" fit than us, your wrong! I bet if you were as injured as Geno is and had to deal with all the fights we have, including the anons, Cross and had to take care of 5 kids on top of it, you couldn't do it!

It can instantly kill anyone and anything that it comes in contact with, with a few exceptions..if you don't have a Soul or your technically already dead, it can't kill you\n  ","8231":"\n  Maybe that's why we get along *he winks* we both have Death on our hands, anyway, since there's nothing going on, how would you like to join us on vacation? It's been a while since you've seen Geno right?\n  ","8232":"\n  If it is then I guess we're old fashioned, I'd follow my Love all the way to the graveyard~\n  ","8233":"\n  Aw but Loovve..*Reaper pouts* fine..I know I can't talk you out of it..\n  ","8234":"\n  Uh..what is it Love?
