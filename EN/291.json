nyu , though .","269307":"i m bisexual .","269308":"i ve been writing as a hobby since i was a pre teen , but i ve been writing professionally since .","269309":"the only things i like that taste like

mood to play for a while . talking to my coworker about video games .","269312":"this would require me to be happy in the first place , lol .","269313":"no , it s just a stereotype .","269314":"sing well .","269315":"it does , especially in terms of pharmacy and pretty much most health care professionals . i pick up different psychiatric medications per month , so it doesn t bother me what the techs might think which they likely don t think anything at all considering how many people pick up different meds per day .","269316":"depends on my mood . most of the time , i like being alone but occasionally i ll crave social interaction .","269317":"no , cashiers literally don t care about what people are buying , lol . the only thing they care about are getting the skus to scan quickly

.","269330":"nah , i ve never been into the whole game design thing . however , i think it would be amazing to write the plot or dialogue of a narrative video game .","269331":"i think i discovered ashnikko this year ? i don t remember , but regardless , her music is fire .","269332":"any of my triggers being set off , whether it s mild or severe .","269333":"i like saving my money , but not for anything in particular . i just feel more comfortable with having some money on the side in case of an emergency .","269334":"i agree also helps spread our names out there so we can get more questions overall .","269335":"lol . me too , it s a bit wild . i m actually getting decent answers to the shout outs too most of the time .","269336":"i honestly have no idea . i wasn t even hungry for lunch today .","269337":"yeah , they finally got back to me and restored my vip status yesterday after i e mailed them again and stated that several others users i ve spoken to were experiencing the same issue . i m taking a screenshot this week too , just to be safe . rofl .","269338":"same ! ! it probably has to do with the glitch askfm experienced earlier this week when a lot of people s vip statuses were taken away because they allegedly didn t complete their tasks . i get the feeling that those shout outs from last week and weeks prior are being sent out now because they may not have been sent out when we initially asked them ? idk .","269339":"i wish there was such a thing as a christmas break for me , lmaoo .","269340":"i m pretty good at saving money i have a savings account that i deposit money into every month or two . i also allocate part of my paychecks to bills each week and keep track of my finances on my phone so i know how much wiggle room i have most weeks .","269341":"a person s daily attitude will tell you more about them than their physical attributes ever will . people can give off a certain look , but it won t erase who they actually are .","269342":"i m actually doing pretty well for a change . i m not looking forward to seeing my family on sunday , but other than that , i don t have many qualms rn .","269343":"yeah , i d get a jaw lift to give myself a defined jawline , liposuction , and top surgery .","269344":"guinness is probably one of the few beers that i absolutely cannot stand , lol .","269345":"askfm has been weird it

been answered .","269346":"working with this candle lit to ease my anxiety .","269347":"i like hot chocolate , but not eggnog really .","269348":"yes , i adore my alone time .","269349":"obviously , yeah . just because someone is another sex from you doesn t mean you cannot forge a friendship with that person .","269350":"somewhat , but at the same time , not really . i like a lot of attention in relationships , but i also require a lot of alone time as well .","269351":"no , i don t involve myself in gossip . i m not a teenager .","269352":"lol , wtf . i would expect them to hunt me , considering i would be a viable source of food .","269353":"not anything that s out of the ordinary .","269354":"the only thing i ve done so far today is work , lol . i ve been working since am it s

.","269360":"yeah , i like her music .","269361":"i don t like the scent being inside the house .","269362":"my roommate s ex girlfriend hated pretty much everyone who came into contact with him , especially if they were women . she used to have severe self esteem issues and felt that every woman was a threat . as a result , she forbid him to talk to most of his friends . in that circumstance , the only thing i could do was message him and ask how he s doing , because i knew how difficult it was to leave a situation like that . eventually he found a way out .","269363":"though the responsibilities assigned to me through work .","269364":"if you want to live , then live for yourself friends and family may be important , but it isn t as important as your own relationship with yourself .","269365":"definitely not , lol . i was outside when i smoked . vaping thc is different , but if i have actual bud , then i ll smoke outside .","269366":"i don t , personally . a few of my friends play though .","269367":"my birthday isn t until late next year .","269368":"it sounds familiar , but idk if i watched it .","269369":"my favorite animals are wolves .","269370":"i honestly have zero idea , but it wouldn t surprise me if it can .","269371":"that s really funny you ask this , because i just came inside from taking a few hits off a bowl , lmaoo . no , it just relaxes me . depending on the strain , sometimes i m even productive .","269372":"for the anon i was talking to earlier last of us won game of the year ! !","269373":"yeah , it kinda came out of nowhere but i m also comfortable answering it because it used to happen to me a lot , lol .","269374":"i usually have mental breakdowns and have panic attacks , breakdowns , anger episodes , etc etc . it doesn t happen very often anymore since i ve been on psychiatric medication .","269375":"pasta , probably .","269376":"honestly ? avocado toast , lol . sometimes i crave it so much .","269377":"hello do you have a question ?","269378":"nah , that isn t my preferred game type . i ve seen a lot of gameplay though , particularly from my friends who stream on twitch .","269379":"i ate pasta and now i m overloaded with carbs .","269380":"i like instagram , but i don t post very often .","269381":"i like subway and moe s the best , if those count as fast food .","269382":"i m actually doing pretty well today . it s been a productive day at work thus far i m clocking out in around minutes , i did some chores around the house on my break , and i m looking forward to relaxing with a few beers that i bought tonight after i eat dinner .","269383":"nah , that takes the fun out of it all .","269384":"apparently i breathe with my mouth open , but i don t snore . lmaoo .","269385":"it s still thursday where i live , but i m thankful tomorrow is friday","269386":"i ve been receiving loads of shout outs ever since i turned the shout out option back on . other than that , not really .","269387":"i think it s a bit counter productive to put the shopping tab where the notifications button used to be . it also took me a while to figure out how to post new photos too , rofl .","269388":"depends on his personality . that being said , most people are skinnier than me , taller than me , and stronger than me . lol .","269389":"i browse it daily , but i don t post daily .","269390":"aw , thank you ! !","269391":"last time i checked , my name isn t celine .","269392":"i normally distract myself through my job , considering i work around hours per day and pick up freelance work on the weekends . i also distract myself through television shows , movies , music , and video games .","269393":"being wrapped up in a blanket on my bed watching a television series that i love .","269394":"i made scrambled eggs and bacon on a toasted english muffin this morning , lol . here s a photo of avocado toast with over easy eggs that i made a few months ago . i don t normally take photos of food .","269395":"it s probably been about sunny and cloudy when it s daytime . yesterday was very cloudy and gray with a small bit of snow , but today it s bright and sunny .","269396":"lately , it s been reaper by have mercy . https youtu . be hhgncbyoykw","269397":"i like wap but that s pretty much it , lol .","269398":"sitting down and relaxing on my lunch break . i just vacuumed the floors and wiped down the counters , and i still have minutes left of my break .","269399":"i understand this feeling all too well it s normal to not feel depression as heavily when you re busy with something such as work , because it keeps your mind distracted . when you have nothing to distract yourself with , that can be when the heaviness sets in . that s why i try to keep myself busy , tbh . it doesn t mean you re faking depression , it s just a mask for the depression . i still advise you seek professional help regardless if that s something you re able to do .","269400":"somewhat , although i didn t expect to be in quite the position i m in today . i still do want to be a published author , though .","269401":"i like whatever that person is most comfortable with . if a woman enjoys wearing lashes , nails , extensions , etc etc . , then she should do what makes her happy without fear of judgment .","269402":"no , not at all . people have to give me a reason to trust them before i begin trusting them .","269403":"i used to be prior to flying for the first time . i first flew on a plane in when i went to texas for a gaming convention

straight razor all of your legs .","269408":"lmao , why would i shave my legs for a complete stranger on the internet ? other people s bodies should not concern you .","269409":"gaming soundtracks comprise of perhaps of the music i listen to regularly . the elder scrolls soundtracks oblivion and skyrim are among my favorites , and i also really enjoy the soundtracks to the halo series , destiny , and assassin s creed valhalla .","269410":"it went fine , thanks for asking . my family just had a quick , regular dinner and i went home with a few dessert items .","269411":"i haven t shaved my legs in months . there s really no reason to do so .","269412":"i listen to some rap music , yeah .","269413":"i m an omnivore i eat meat although lately it s been rare and i have no issues with discussing vegetarianism or veganism , or any other type of lifestyle . however , i don t really know much about plant based lifestyles so my knowledge is pretty limited .","269414":"i turned a few

celebrity has posted on their verified social media accounts that they also use askfm , it s safe to say that they don t use askfm . there are a number of accounts posing as celebrities , pretty much all of them are fake and just doing so for attention .","269422":"i m fairly certain that most celebrities do not have an askfm account .","269423":"he s apparently a musician , but i ve never heard his music before .","269424":"i haven t used skype in years , haha .","269425":"i ve become more of a morning person over the past few years . i like getting up early and being productive

migraines when i use cool compresses , lay in a dark and quiet room , and try to relax my breathing . they re the most painful types of headaches though , so mostly time helps as long as you can control your emotions . crying makes them so much worse .","269474":"anywhere between hours .","269475":"yeah , that s where i did the majority of my homework and papers .","269476":"chocolate chip

.","269512":"les miserables sweeney todd .","269513":"low , as always .","269514":"no . my trauma shouldn t have happened because it altered the chemistry in my brain , made me develop loads of

.","269548":"just the normal s icidal thoughts and urges to hurt myself . whenever she asks me about it all , i panic and convince her they re just passive thoughts , not active , when in reality they re pretty damn active . i can t afford a hospital stay , though . both financially and also in terms of my job . sometimes i think i need a week in the hospital because my mental health gets that bad , but there s too much to risk by doing so .","269549":"yeah , i m crossing my fingers that they can restore it . not that it s a big deal or anything , but i did enjoy the extra questions i was receiving based on being vip .","269550":"that awkward moment when you reveal a bit too much to your therapist and then you re terrified they re going to hospitalize you . fun times .","269551":"ah , okay . i e mailed askfm because i was confused , and then i got the weekly status email this afternoon saying i didn t fulfill all of the requirements even though i definitely did . the representative

about it .","269821":"people aren t lesser than or wanting of sympathy for having a disability , regardless of what that disability is . the fact that able bodied people treat disabled people differently is demeaning . mental disabilities are just as debilitating as physical disabilities , especially considering many mental illnesses manifest themselves as physical symptoms too . the amount of ableism is society today , worldwide , is absolutely ridiculous , which is why i ve always been an advocate of disability rights . it s so difficult for people to obtain disability benefits from the government for absurd reasons .","269822":"definitely not , lol . you can see that in all of my profile photos .","269823":"probably around or so , ranging from sandals and sneakers to various sized boots .","269824":"i m fairly health conscious , but i also don t restrict myself from eating what i want or crave . the only unhealthy foods i don t eat are most fast food things

.","269828":"this is going to sound terrible , but m rder . i ve just always been interested in seeing how it feels .","269829":"yeah , although it wasn t so much a breakup as it was just distancing

bring easy things like plates , napkins , utensils , soda and iced tea , etc etc .","269843":"i ve already found my calling , so the logical answer would be to find a soul mate . however , i don t believe in the idea of a person having only one soul mate at all i believe there are multiple people with whom we connect on an intimate level , and it doesn t necessarily have to be in a romantic context either .","269844":"i like open questions , but i also accept plenty of anonymous questions too depending on what is being asked . it doesn t much matter to me if someone is anonymous or not what does matter is the content . as for questions , i prefer personalized questions regarding my life , hobbies , career , education , relationships , etc etc . i also like talking about mental

entirely sure .","269864":"i prefer to answer questions .","269865":"you can use your coins to buy a promotion through askfm , and they ll promote your answer to other users .","269866":"ah yes , because our own concerns about our makeup is obviously more important than protecting ourselves and others against a deadly pandemic . you want things to return to a level of normalcy ? continue wearing a mask and social distancing .","269867":"hello do you have a question ?","269868":"it isn t so much a test as it is an evaluation through discussion of symptoms from past through present .
