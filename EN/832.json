problems have come up that would ve been easy to push away with all the distractions of normal life . i have spent many nights between the hours of am and am crying and trying to sort myself out . the biggest thing i m learning is to come to terms with the truths of myself and my life . bad things happen . we make bad choices . we have demons we don t want to have . but if it happened it happened , and ruminating on how it shouldn t have happened or you should ve done something differently only prolongs your own mental torture . it s okay that it happened . i made it through . i got stronger because of it . yeah in a perfect world it shouldn t have happened , but this world is far from perfect and this is what we have to deal with . the past can t hurt you anymore . it s gone . it s over . all you can do is accept it , learn from it , make better choices this time , or just walk in confidence knowing that if it happens again , you know how to handle it . life truly is a tragedy , but all the best stories are .","769857":"i used to be in musical theater and do plays also we ve done a hsm mashup , pitch perfect and two originals single on valentines day , and new year new
