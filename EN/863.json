We have done a short comedy webseries called summer with cimorelli with awesomeness tv and a real life webseries about our move to Tennessee and trying to find our place in a new town called \"life as cimorelli\" and even had parts in a movie called, \"hope springs eternal\". We also have met the jonas brothers, opened a show for them as well, but lisa would probably cry again aha\n  ","926622":"\n  I dont have any\n  ","926623":"\n  Im obsessed with her new album. Theres a few songs of hers that wasnt my cup of tea but overall 95% of her music is good. Like i wasnt a huge fan of blank space or her more darker trend\n  ","926624":"\n  Going to reanswer this, since i feel way better and can actually sit down and focus instead of trying to do three things at once. They are human. We make mistakes. Even the leaders of our countries have made mistakes and our role models because nothing in life is perfect, but what we jhst consider to be \"good enough\". The boys are still young ranging from mid 20s down to 18-19. They are still learning who they want to be and what they want to do and their message. Which can take years to figure out and tons of experimenting. Trust me i know. Im 21  it took us two years to figure out our style and to find our voice after being let down by the la music industry. It took us years to find out what our passion and purpose was. Growing up in the spotlight isnt easy as well as you may think it is. Youre under the spotlight 24\/7, you dont get to be a \"normal kid\" because your life now revolves around impressing others such as the fans, the labels, the managers and partnerships. You dont have time to go out and play with friends in the mud and live out your reckless side by racing eachother down the street on your bike. You don't have the freedom to say certain things like a kid would because it will backfire and be held over your head for years ..for example look at the paul brothers probably the most hated youtubers there is idk. But jake does stuff that is dumb and reckless and the media and that hold it over his head for years and call him a bad person for just doing something he thought was fun or cool. So think about the guys ... They dont get to live out their childhood or have fun like everyone else does because this is their lives now and they are always in the spotlight being watched on every move they make... Because no one has the respect to just let them be happy and have fun and do what they love. You guys criticize everything they do because you dont \"agree with it\". You dont want them to make mistakes like a normal human being does and learn from   it. Or you dont even sit down and think for a second what they deal with on a day to day basis or how they feel. You think you know their personal lives like the alphabet and get upset when they decide to keep things personal because you guys intrude on it. You guys dont respect how hard they work for you, to put on a show, to put out music, to even try their hardest to atleast make you guys hapoy. But youre to focus on who they hang out with, who their girlfriends are, what they done in their past, them vaping, them being rude because they mightve had a hard day. You guys never take their feelings into consideration. Another thing is they spend so much time away from their families 99% of the time and only see  them a few times out of the year you guys never think that maybe theyre homesick as well? Cba i love these boys so much. And if you cant take their feelings into consideration then you dont deserve to be in the fandom. Comparing a person to   another is just wrong on another topic.

She told us we could sit wherever, and she will take our order for the drinks (pop,water,juuce etc.) And our server will be with us in a minute. The girl was super polite and professional. The server i dont have much postive feedback on. She acted like she didnt even want to work, in the back talking the entire time, and then what made me mad was the other girl who helped us earlier seen a old couple walk in and told them they could sit wherever they want as the place wasnt that busy. The server walked out and told them she will be with them in a second but rilled her eyes and said in a very snotty way \"or not\". Then when my mother  went to go pay after we had finished eating  the server once again was very unprofessional by having a snotty attitude about taking the coupon off. My mom didnt tip her because of the way she was acting. She also didnt do her job like she should have, leaving the other girl to take care of the customers or having to call her out if HER customers needed something.
