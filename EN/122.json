attachment to it at all , and i don t care about gifts or christmas dinner or any of that . i really enjoy seeing the bright lights and decorations , i like the carols , i love decorating the tree i have pretty good childhood memories from xmas if nothing else , because hardly anyone is a total asshole at christmas at least , not in my family which is super surprising . maybe that s it maybe i love the time of year leading up to xmas so much because it was the only time i have good , normal , happy memories from being a kid .","112852":"thank you , and yes ofc","112853":"i would love a average sized house like , br . bath or whatever that sits in a clearing at the end of a longish , curving driveway through the woods . i d have an acre or two where i grew various herbs and flowers to distill into oils , as well as bee hives . i d learn to make soap , and have a work shed with big sinks and counters . for the living part of the house , i think i lean more towards the whatever , that s cute , put it there school of decorating nowadays though in the past i was much more particular about color themes and shit . i want bright colors and kitsch and cat friendly and comfort . i have a ton of art that i ve either done or purchased everywhere now , so that would still be the case . i d have lots of natural sunlight , and a cozy patio in the back with a fire pit . it would probably be here in washington , somewhere surrounded by trees with a view of a snow capped mountain . it would be out of town a bit , but not far enough to not have city water sewage and good internet .","112854":"sure , it s definitely important . especially intimacy . i can t see a relationship working for very long without the trust and openness that comes from being intimate with someone , even if sex isn t a part of that equation . as far as sex goes , it s a need we all have though some more than others . experience is so not important . not stressing out and being honest and genuine are what make sex more enjoyable , not time tested moves .","112855":"cinnamon , peppermint , cloved orange , cider , a baking virginia ham , bloody mary mix . my paternal grandfather s girlfriend after my grandmother passed , miss essie as we called her , always has a big christmas party on christmas eve that lasts all day long , and cooks a ham and everyone brings a little something and gets drunk . there was often hot cider or some sort of kid safe spiced hot drink for us as well . her house was always decorated for christmas year round , which is something my grandmother started when my dad was a kid and all of their close friends picked up in her honor . it s one of the reasons i love xmas trees so much , as everyone on my dad s side growing up except for my dad , but he does go all out at actual xmas time had their tree up all year and just changed out decorations . anyway , a lot of her decorating included those cinnamon brooms and pine cones , so her little house had a lot of cinnamon and food smells . those were good times , i am sad i didn t keep in better touch with that group .","112856":"chinese food buffet , and yeah probably lol .","112857":"the man is to blame , he is the person who made a commitment to someone else , not the woman . if it were my relationship , i would probably have some questions but overall would be pretty okay . i have a hard time agreeing with the whole concept of marriage meaning ownership of my sexuality , and honestly feel like i d do better in a poly relationship , but my husband isn t comfortable with that at this time . if he were to find someone else , i d be overall glad that he realized that someone else might meet some of his needs better than i can , and that that s alright with me .","112858":"end , begin , all the same . big change . sometimes good . sometimes bad .","112859":"i hate being wrong and will fight it until everyone hates my guts . debate feels like attacks , and i panic and defend . i have weird triggers and childhood ptsd . i m working on it admitting when i m wrong i think i m getting better at it .","112860":"i ve been thinking about this a lot lately because i have a ton of essential oils i purchased for my diffuser and i love experimenting with different combinations . it would definitely have a frankincense base , with some spicy layers , maybe peppermint , clove , and ginger . the top note would be jasmine , with maybe a teeeny tiny bit of tangerine . the bottle would be glass , with a sturdy base that cats can t knock over . a gradient of dark orange to yellow from bottom to top maybe ? spray bottle . reasonably priced but only sold in specific boutiques .","112861":"i think i use intellect and instinct together more than either one separately .","112862":"it doesn t matter , not even a little bit . i ve dated both people with large amounts of previous partners and no previous partners at all . sex is sex . it s really weird to me how our society treats it , it s a natural part of life not a magical ritual .","112863":"i mean , i m a pretty good cook . i make whatever . i m best at cooking meats , soups , stews , roasts , casseroles , main courses . desserts have never really been my thing .","112864":"i guess gold , or a palette of gold with warm reds and deep maroons . i think i associate these colors with love partially because they are sort of valentine y colors and it s socially ingrained , and partially because those are colors i would associate with warmth and treasure , and love is both .","112865":"i have no idea . probably on the corner of the bed while changing sheets .","112866":"i don t have any good advice for this , but i ll list how i met people i went out with more than once or twice as an adult , in case that helps at least , what i can remember gallery opening through a mutual friend at a party literally ran into on street corner while not paying attention library walked past him in a diner window a few times running errands on foot , he came out and asked me out for ice cream internet gaming goth y little hole in the wall coffee shop swing dance instructor karaoke bar co worker another co worker my husband was that last co worker . i guess the thing to learn here is dates can be found everywhere , just do the things you like to do and expand your social circles in ways you re comfortable doing so . i didn t go into any of these situations expecting to meet someone . good luck !","112867":"my desk , with both xmas tree light options shown","112868":"i had never heard of this until you brought it up . i m not going to dig too deep , i have triggers about missing persons cases .","112869":"i ve never come across anything that i couldn t get in the us either directly or at least through an import store of some sort .","112870":"not as a life achievement , certainly . i think there s been a recent shift as far as what is perceived as the timeline of adulthood that we ve always been told to adhere to college , marriage , house , family , etc . the economic climate , the amount of schooling required for so many of the desirable jobs , more acceptance of different family definitions , and so many other things have made renting or taking home ownership at a different pace than before the new norm . personally i still want to own a home one day , but mainly because i want a yard or a little bit of land to buffer me from other people s noise , a chance to customize things to how i like them , and some beehives .","112871":"probably not . he is an extreme procrastinator , and i feel like that would be his undoing pretty quickly .","112872":"i ve been to a couple , and in fact went to the thanksgiving buffet at the kennedy school this past thanksgiving which was my first time going to that particular mcmenamin s , it was very nice . i didn t get a chance to soak in the pools , but some homeless folks asked me on my way out to the car if i had so i guess that s a thing most people that look like me go there to do p maybe one day . the other ones i ve been to were small pubs , i can t remember which locations . the food is very good , and if it didn t require travel to alaska , i d consider the mcmeniman passport challenge .","112873":"i would just like a good hug , and it really doesn t matter so much with who as long as they are not stinky or scary","112874":"i mostly agree , but there are always exceptions . if you re comfortable standing up against a problem and saying or doing something and it won t put you in danger to do so , then yes absolutely be proactive . however there are certain situations where someone might be in danger if they do or say something and in those cases obviously safety comes first .","112875":"lullaby in birdland , girl from ipenema , please don t talk about me when i m gone , black coffee , other random jazz standards . sometimes i ll throw in some joni mitchell . no my voice

friday online purchases that i m fairly enamored with , including a bright pink raincoat and don t tell my husband ! a very long scarf that looks like a slice of pizza that i plan to put in his xmas

teicher tei shi , ian anderson of jethro tull , joni mitchell , jeff buckley , and lady gaga .","112886":"in the mood i ve been in most of today , i d choose people who were unable to reproduce . if i had to choose for realsies , i guess i d choose an equal amount of healthy and reproductively sound and willing young adults from each region of the world , making sure that all were well versed in the stories and heritage of their region s people so that they could passed down and recorded . each person would need to be willing and able to survive under whatever conditions , and there would probably be tests devised to measure those sorts of things in the screening process . it feels so clinical and gross thinking about this . i would definitely not choose myself . my genes do not need to be carried on to a new world of humankind .","112887":"well , we ve established i like emmitt otter , but other favorites include scrooged , elf , muppet s christmas carol , and a charlie brown christmas . sometimes i will pull out my copy of santa claus conquers the martians . my husband always wants to watch die hard or gremlins .","112888":"haha i should have one , right ? i m old enough for sure and i definitely like femme pop lately but during the time they were popular , i was pretty exclusively listening to punk , new wave , and classic rock . i only know two of their songs and i m not especially attached to either .","112889":"an allisonberry","112890":"i m pretty anxious myself , so i might not be the best advice giver on this . i m actually in the middle of a medical roller coaster trying to figure out why my cortisol levels are so high adrenaline hormone in some areas of my body but not others , and all these other symptoms are presenting and i guess severe anxiety and mood swings are part of the dealio while i wait for yet another specialist to call and schedule with me next is a neurologist . before all this , i managed it somewhat well but still not really really well . i have a xanax prescription and a medical marijuana recommend but weed is really the only thing that helps . and a good cry . and yoga when i m able . none of them are absolute though . there are a few other types of non benzo anti anxiety things a doctor can prescribe , i know a lot of people find relief with buspar . my best advice is talk to your doc , do some exercise if you re able , make time to feel your feelings , self care self care self care , and smoke weed everyday p","112891":"i feel like i barely talk out loud lately , past a couple of hours in the evenings . i don t recall cussing in my head very much , but i m sure i do it . probably a lot . i m just not really conscious of my thoughts as words always ? oh god now i m sitting here trying to overthink this and it s getting weird i m too high for this mess lol","112892":"owls , all of em . i have a large collection of weird owl stuff . something about them has always appealed to me , they re such strange and distinct birds .","112893":"queen allison of the pinetrees","112894":"i suppose it s a saying meant to state than when the man of the house gets home , he s the king . which is gross . my mother always used to scream at me that there could only be one queen in a castle , as she felt like i didn t give her enough deference . it seems to be just another shitty saying giving the head of the household some semblance of power in this crap world .","112895":"people around here move in and out so quick i don t really get to know anyone . i know a little bit about the horrorshow next door but only because she opens her loud , squealing maw to complain about just about anything any of the neighbors upstairs do and i ve protected my own interests should she decide to come after me by finding out her name and keeping an eye on her facebook she posts everything as public so now i have screenshots of her seven cats for blackmail purposes we re only allowed to have , yes i know i have , but

kid we still had access to track players and i had the rumors track cartridge o o probably my two favorite fleetwood mac songs are both stevie songs , and are both on the st album rhiannon and landslide . i do like stevie nicks solo career as well , maybe slightly more than fleetwood mac times , but still , i wouldn t like , want to listen to her all the time , just once in a while . i like the songs nightbird and stand back the most .","112898":"hrmmmm here s songs that i ve enjoyed recently good mistake by mr little jeans holiest by glass animals ft . tei shi kill v maim by grimes war on women by yacht magazine by caroline smith","112899":"to be honest i m not especially familiar with many of the vampire universes at this point . i never read anne rice s novels or the twilight books . typical dracula type lore seems to have too many ways to die . the buffyverse would mean some messed up forehead wrinkle action , and not being able to be in sunlight , tru blood vamps can t do the sunlight thing either plus have the realllllly gory , sticky deaths . . . . but that might be okay if i had a faerie hanging around to let me sip on . i guess i d have to pick the new ahs vamps , even though i don t know much about them yet they don t morph into fanged wrinkle heads , they can enjoy limited amounts of sunlight , and while they seem to be able to be immortal , they re not invincible so that seems like a good thing to know after a few thousand years or whatever when things are just atrociously awful and boring .","112900":"if a problem comes along , you must whip it","112901":"like many of the others i ve seen answer your question so far , i d want to establish some sort of wealth or at least set things up so that i could accrue wealth , by whatever means necessary . living forever is going to be quite expensive . while doing that , the time would likely be passed learning , exploring , finding ways to enrich my now endless life . i d want to keep it hidden from people , except maybe a very select few . i feel like there would be too much risk of abduction and experimentation . then again , maybe once i d done everything i feel i could do in the world , i ought to donate myself to select scientific communities to study , maybe whatever it is that makes me immortal could help cure something in mortals , who knows . i mean , unless i m a vampire . then i m gonna spend it drinking people s blood and scaring teens and shit . also , this is my , th answer yayayayay","112902":"i had a snoopy plush toy that my grandmother bought for me when we were in the mall when i was still stroller aged . she says we walked past it and i didn t say a word , just reached out to it like it was the only thing i could see anymore and when she picked it up and handed it to me , i hugged it and didn t want to let go . so snoopy and i were besties for years . i still have him in storage , though his ears , nose , arms , legs , and tail have all been re sewn about a zillion times and he s quite grey now . now , i dunno , i guess my pc internet access really . sitting here at my desk is a good portion of my time lately , either because of creative work or playing games or hanging out or whatever .","112903":"this question is hitting really hard tonight . things have been rough with my closest friend , at a time where i m physically and

. yes , , will be in january","112909":"it was it follows , but that s not important . what s important is that earlier i took a nap and in that nap i had a dream that i was going to the theater to see a sequel to emmit otter s jugband christmas .","112910":"has been sort of a nightmare hellride to be honest . like , i thought was bad but then came . i had hopes , things seemed like they were looking up , and then i just started getting sicker and sicker and now i m in the never ending medical mystery tour , from specialist to specialist , being told i may have a brain tumor , then being told that s fine but i may have a neurological disorder or possibly something wrong with an ovary and i don t even know my tests are all over the place . good things that happened in i got a lot of creative work done , although game making is on hold again as both myself and my partner are having major personal issues currently . my sister is pregnant with another healthy boy . made new friends

don t know that true love exists , or at least in the there s one person out there for everyone ! sense . i don t believe in soulmates , i believe in soul groups in a way , in that i think it s

impact . barring that , i always think i d like to volunteer at an animal shelter but then i remember how much poop cleaning is probably involved lol .","112917":"mental illness . the stigma against the mentally ill is dangerous and heartbreaking . i try to always stay very open about what i m going through because i am able to without too much of a tax on my well being . i think it s important to make it seem more normal and socially acceptable to ask for help when you need it , to talk about what you re going through without being scared of harsh judgement . as far as taboo and should remain that way , i m not sure . as far as why topics are taboo , it s because we are emotional and judgmental beings terrified of being alienated from each other but desperate to exclude others so we can continue to feel included .","112918":"misogyny , racism , general hatefulness or sometimes , just because i have no interest in their answers . i do not unfollow people often , but i don t choose to follow new people often either .","112919":"i almost never remember to eat lunch , to be honest . when i do , it s generally a protein bar or an egg sandwich .","112920":"i had a terrible childhood . my mother is a high functioning , untreated narcissist with borderline personality disorder . my earliest memories mostly include myself as barely a toddler , or , climbing across my crib to the dresser and then down so i could go feed myself breakfast because mom wouldn t be rolling out of bed for several hours . from the time my parents divorced at age until my ex stepfather moved in , i have no memories of my mother past seeing her chain smoke while talking to her girlfriends on the phone . hbo and mtv were basically my only companions until my baby sister was old enough to join me in our neglect . once she was older , i was responsible for her as well . i was the th grader packing our lunches and making sure we had our homework and were ready for school . i was also the th grader wearing stiletto heels to walk to school with colors of eye shadow piled on because i had no mom to look at me and say wtf you can t wear that . when i was , my mom and ex stepdad had a son , and things changed slightly but only because he got all freaked out over shit finally once it applied to his real kid . at that point , i became the scapegoat . my brother the baby was the golden child and my sister avoided conflict and attention as much as possible by keeping her head down and doing whatever mom said , essentially forcing her to pretend she was my mother at that age to appease my mother playing softball even though she hated it , having boyfriends at the skating rink , all the same shit that was important to my mother as a teen . i was in constant conflict with her because i d spent a decade being the adult of the house and i wasn t keen on suddenly being told what to do , especially by someone who so clearly had no fucking idea what she was doing . she approved of literally nothing i did , picking fights literally just to make me cry . none of my friends were good enough , all of my teachers were out to get me she hated for me to have a relationship with anyone else besides her because this woman who barely fucking looked at me most of my childhood suddenly was jealous and mad that i didn t want to be her bff and number one daughter . her neglect possibly lead to sexual abuse by one of her boyfriends . i ve had flashbacks but i have nothing to go on . and the parties . no year old should have to wake up and carefully step over strange men on the floor passed out . i remember trying to pour some rare and tasty orange juice from the fridge only to realize it had vodka in it after a sip . anyway all of this culminated in me not speaking to her anymore and not having a relationship with my now total sociopath , woman beating half brother , or his dad who got a divorce like or years ago or some mess . i would love to have had a real mom . i used to daydream about my mom s friend cam being my mom instead .","112921":"pro tip fancy vocabulary choices don t suddenly make you sound intelligent , especially when you are unable to string

absolutely not pick up a hitchhiker , there s no way that would ever feel safe for me .","112923":"right now i m so terrified of death that i wasn t going to answer this . i want to live , desperately

s not something that i m particularly interested in or feel any connection to now . i want to get a small tribute to loglady catherine coulson on my right arm , but i haven t finalized a sketch . i d also love to get a back piece having to do with owls but there s no way i could afford something like that anytime soon . i m very high risk for breast cancer , so i ve been trying to consider what i

president is important enough to be worthy of assassination .","112930":"i do not , i don t really have any objects to hide . sorry for the boring answer lol . however when my sister and i were little , we lived in an apartment for a little while that had some woods and a swamp behind it in virginia . we dug out little holes behind the roots and in the clay dirt of an old uprooted tree and kept toys and stuff in there until one of the mean neighborhood boys found our stash and dumped all of our treasures in the swamp .","112931":"i m imagining that this is donald trump clicking anon , making a list to give the nsa or whatever .","112932":"i m pro porn as long as it s consensual and exploitation free .","112933":"all of them are scary but i guess i d pick sky diving because i fear falling slightly less than i fear being underwater for very long and with bungee jumping you have to fall bounce a lot but with sky diving you only fall once , and it s slowed by a parachute so you can see the view if all goes well . at least i assume . i probably wouldn t do any of these things .","112934":"i m lucky to have loved many . love feels like growing a new limb that then detaches and becomes a person in it s own right , who you then meet at a later date and realize that you can t imagine life without that you can feel the pains they feel that you want to share everything with and when they re gone , it feels again like you ve been severed apart except now , you re hyper aware of the part missing .","112935":"i ve done this before , or at least very close to this i won a trip to lake tahoe last new year s and only had days to figure everything out . normally i would accept , but currently i cannot because of medical things .","112936":"i don t click links from anons , ever , for any reason , soz .","112937":"why can t you hear a pterodactyl go to the bathroom ? because the p is silent .","112938":"i ve never had any especially strong desire to go to another country , past the vague i want to see new things ! dealie . if i had to choose , i d maybe pick england ? a lot of my ancestry is from there , it would be neat to maybe see some of the places ancestors of mine lived and make a christmas out of it , all days . i d bring my husband and his parents , sister , brother in law , and nephews and their families my sister and her family , my dad and stepmother . i d love to have a big christmas morning in front of a big , pretty tree and open gifts and eat brunch together .","112939":"i m glad you re feeling better sorry i couldn t think up more questions , i ve been going through some shit too . self harm as part of ocd ? i m sure it s possible , i don t have any experience with that personally but there are a lot of things affected by it certainly . one of my ocd sub types is compulsive skin picking disorder , but it s not done as a form of self harm at all , but because i m compulsively trying to smooth out rough spots as a form of contamination ocd . if you are harming yourself in order to feel something , or to punish yourself , sometimes that also falls into personality disorder categories , or possibly bipolar behavior . i recently read a book called stop walking on eggshells about having loved ones with borderline personality disorder , and i know self harm is one of the common symptoms of bpd . it s an interesting read if you re into that sort of thing . sure , it s something to worry about . but is worrying about it going to make you obsess over it more ? is it something maybe to just be mindful of and consider carefully ? next time , think about why you re doing it . consider what sensation you particularly want to feel . can it be duplicated in a less damaging way ? i have a friend who crushes ice cubes in his hands rather than punching himself . i remember someone in one of my college classes who snapped a thick rubber band against her wrist when she wanted to cut . hope your progress continues , and good luck","112940":"no

wrapping presents ! i did it professionally during and after college while working as a visual merchandiser first at a small gift card jewelry dance supply shop near my college and then after i left school as the visual merchandising asst . manager at a huge tourist attraction state funded artisan and craft showcase in west virginia . as far as tags and bows , it honestly depends on what i have on hand . i like to add ribbons for sure .","112943":"i can t think of one book or documentary that changed the way i thought any more than any others . i m not incredibly changeable , but i think that any well done presentation of an idea might get gears moving towards change of thought in a small way . i try to learn from everything .","112944":"i bought a men s weatherproof brand flannel

visit on weekends when he could i was in massachusetts at the time . his birthday was upcoming and we were celebrating his birthday early unexpectedly because he had thought he wouldn t be able to come down and then could at the last minute or something but anyway i thought it would be nice to give him a sexy massage and bought some nice smelling oils and thought oh , i could put this in this thin , cheap glass bowl with a tealight candle underneath and warm it a bit , that totally won t be a disaster so of course right as we re nekkid and i go to reach for the heated oil the bowl shattered everywhere and sliced up the birthday boy pretty bad i jumped back and avoided getting cut not like , serious bad , but i can laugh about it now bad . then i cried a lot because i felt like

deals with relationship ends differently .","112951":"this is hard to answer , because i ve been in love several times and each time was very different . the only consistent thing was that i knew it was love because i never questioned it . i just accepted it as true . lust , i don t know much about these days . it s definitely not as lasting as love , but sometimes just as fierce . i still love people i no longer feel lust for .","112952":"i was and my friend s older brother was having a graduation party at his house so i walked down there with my sister and brother to have a hotdog and say hi or whatever but i ended up chatting with this guy who had just graduated from my high school who i sort of knew and we ended up taking a walk around the block and it started raining and he kissed me in the rain , standing in someone else s yard . i don t remember anything about the kiss itself . i ended up dating that guy very briefly because my mother for whatever reason encouraged me to date adults as a young teen but i ended up breaking his heart before anything was very serious .","112953":"i m going to go with hootie and the sunshine band on this one .","112954":"so so so often , with

like that , prince julio . nah , i never give a fake name , mostly just because i ve been saying the same thing for so long that it just comes out of my mouth in those situations . . . campbell . like the soup .","112959":"this is tough because i so rarely watch movies but some movies are so important to me and they are all over the place . i guess if i was choosing for the potential new movies that might come out in future years , i d pick horror . i enjoy horror movies and would hate to miss new ones . i d really miss the mad max movies and muppet froud everything and plenty of dark comedies .","112960":"a brick or a firetruck","112961":"always with the male domination questions it s not a funny troll anymore . i m not even mad . i m uncomfortable , but that s the main goal of

would rather talk to animals . i ve heard what men have to say .","112963":"yeahhhhh , i tend to think along the same lines as you on this stuff , marty . the attacks in paris were absolutely atrocious . . . . just like all of the other attacks in all of the other less white , less western countries . as far as this pianist and other shit like it it reminds me of when i was an etsy seller and every time there was a devastating event , you d see other sellers popping up tribute items in their shops claiming to send some minuscule percentage to some charity or what not but clearly the

togethers , i enjoyed cooking big meals . i m not much of a baker or dessert maker , but sometimes i d make peanut butter cookies or banana bread or one time i made baklava . in general though i ve been tasked with main dishes , soups , or casseroles , which i m much more confidant about . now , it s just me and my husband mostly so we ve been in the habit of going to restaurants for the holidays .","112971":"i m someone who feels guilt inappropriately . i feel cripplingly guilty over things i have zero control over . it rarely has anything to do with anything i ve actually done . normally , i m okay with the choices i make and feel that i am morally good though maybe that doesn t always line up with other s ideas of that or whatever . i don t generally feel too guilty over my actions , i guess , unless they were a bad choice that i didn t think through thoroughly . however , i ll feel so anxiously guilty over the fact that one of my cats batted at a cabinet door at am and it was kind of loud and a neighbor might have heard that i won t be able to make eye contact for a week .","112972":"pretty messed up .","112973":"sure . nothing major . we ll leave it at that lol . i

shrink .","112976":"my self care comforts include oversized men s flannel shirts , peppermint tea , my overpriced polk wireless headphones playing a spotify playlist i created specifically for calming me down , and weed . if none of that helps , then xanax and sleep . i love hugs , but i hate being clung to . so i guess i prefer my own space , but will happily accept small breaks from my own space . i am terrible at comforting others i feel , though i dunno . i just try to be honest , genuine , and actively listen .","112977":"i think it s absolutely ridiculous . i had a friend at one time who spent several years in a federal prison for being homeless and stealing toiletries . his third strike was for speed stick deodorant .","112978":"yeah , it shows that the american justice system hates people of color . i ve known a lot of criminals strangely enough , and most of them were white and served much less time for worse crimes than the african americans i know who have also been incarcerated .","112979":"i do my best to and if i don t , it has nothing to do with how they appear but maybe their tone or the vibe they put off . if someone is aggressive from the start and seems like an uncaring person , i ll probably start off on the wrong foot with them . sometimes i m pretty unfair in that way . i admit freely that my mood weighs in a lot on how charming i am when i meet someone new . i do try to control that though","112980":"i have a lot of anxiety and panic issues , that i m being told now are likely caused by this tumor on my pituitary gland so maybe that will change after we get this shit sorted but for the meantime , i m basically on the verge of an adrenaline imbalance at all times and can get realllllly angry for basically nothing . the questions most likely to trigger that fury are . questions about motherhood assuming that i m fertile or a parent i am not on either count , and it makes me really mad as a feminist when i feel like women are reduced to maiden , mother , or crone roles and disregarded otherwise . women are more than their opinions on babies or their ability to breed . . as with the maiden , mother , crone statement , i also absolutely detest questions about virginity or any very personal sexual questions . that s no one s business unless we know each other very well or are having a conversation about that specifically and privately . . i hate being asked things that don t have anything to do with my thoughts or opinions on something but instead want me to basically act as google for the asker . i m not google . as far as things i may have answered before but wouldn t now i can t think of anything . i ve always been pretty touchy about the same sorts of things .","112981":"ooof . i haven t even started thinking about gifts yet . we really don t buy them for anyone other than the little kid nephews and niece and sometimes something small for each other but even that gets put aside some years . my concern at christmas time is always more about sending cards and getting the tree up past that , i m like , whatever . i think my oldest nephew wants ninja turtle stuff lately his soon to be brother needs newborn clothes , and my niece i have no idea , i don t talk to her parents so we ll probably just send whatever i find that looks cute . ideally , of course , i d have tons of money and buy gifts for everyone i care about and i love to choose things for people but with my medical bills always and only having one steady income , it just can t happen . if i had a nice house with a big kitchen and room for people to stay , i d love to host a big christmas party where people could stay overnight and there would be food and games and time spent together , preferably somewhere with a nice mountain or forest view maybe i d cook a big roast , a virginia ham , and a tofurky with all sorts of sides and desserts . i have no idea what i would want for christmas gifts for myself . i guess a slanket .","112982":"glance at phone to see what i m up against , pee , brush teeth , try to make sense of at least my bangs and push the rest back in a bun , grab a ginger ale to take my meds

.","112986":"like , practically all of them","112987":"we celebrate mildly , in that we do generally dress nice and go to a special dinner somewhere or other , but i don t decorate or go all out or anything . thanksgiving is kind of just the holiday that has to happen so that i can finally dig out my christmas ornaments because although i m not christian and have no real religious or spiritual ties to christmas i m really really into the lights and tree decorating .","112988":"we were driving across town a couple of weeks ago and saw a high speed police chase that resulted in the guy being chased losing control , bouncing into the median , and then bouncing from there to the other direction into the treeline . he was only mildly injured and no one else was hit , it was pretty miraculous because he was all over the place .","112989":"i walked out of the theater for the hitchhiker s guide movie . i can t even pick one thing that was bad , because literally everything was bad . from the opening musical dolphin number to how terrible the acting was . . . . . ugh . ugh , ugh , ugh .","112990":"i do work best under pressure , but only without distraction . i haven t had a hard deadline

for . then they bring you pizza and promise you shit until you come out and get shot at . or at least this is what i ve learned from tv .","112996":"wait what ? ! where is this hour kfc and why isn t it close to me ? and to lock in the hostages , of course .","112997":"lately i worry that i am attracted to people who provide very specific negative behaviors to fit a pattern in my life caused by a negligent mother , so that s kinda weird i guess . otherwise , usually we have some things in common , some things not , i guess . i don t recall ever having been very attracted to someone who had nothing or little in common with me .","112998":"i m not a mother and therefore don t have answers for that sort of question . i choose not to discuss my sexual life almost ever . anything else usually is fine .","112999":"i walked past someone at a craft store a few weeks ago that smelled just like grape bonkers used to smell and it really brought back some overly sweet memories .","113000":"psh acting like you don t know what the new labron hoots look like . you re just jealous .","113001":"i will forgive a million different grammar errors and i m certainly no grammar expert

on a little neighborhood river walk a couple of towns over from me . i don t remember how we ended up over there but i thought it was neat there were lots of little artsy things along the path , including a mosaic in a underpass with a local native story that i completely can t recall right now , and other strange sculptural pieces here and there . all of this begins in a parking lot for a blanket manufacturer wool mill which is also a bit strange . i dunno , washington is weird . it probably is alien communications lol .","113003":"in person , i m going to say something without hesitation . they said that mess in public and they deserve to be held accountable for it . online as you already know hahaha sorry there s a possibility i ll stick my nose in but only if i m super triggered . in the case in particular this q references , i waited until the two asshats were both kinda of given the are you joking right now ? ! ? ! comment from you , cause i figured at that point you were not having their shit anymore , either , and i was there to not only express my anger but also to back you up . usually , i keep my mouth shut on other people s facebook posts . i have a friend who always has terrible racists on her posts , but she is in a position where they are family or whatnot and often approaches their comments in a way that indicates that she s trying to just keep things from escalating so i wouldn t ever comment on her posts because obviously that would escalate things . i personally don t like drama on my page , and have blocked people for trying to debate my opinion with me uninvited , but if it was for whatever reason not caught and deleted by me first and a friend jumped in to back up my opinion or whatever for me , i would be okay with that . usually i let it go , but in rare cases , i just fly in there like a tornado of fists . shrug","113004":"well , my sister s family with my two young nephews live in ms as well so this is pretty disturbing news . i m not sure how to fix it . i ve not been very interested in politics until more recently , to be honest . i mean , i d say through education but apparently that s not even being adequately funded . it s going to take extreme action of some sort i just don t know what would be the best course of action and what the risks vs . rewards would be .","113005":"i can t think of any personal memories , but one of my exes has a really great one . he was riding his scooter in the parking lot of some music venue that huey was going to be playing at back in the s , when my ex was around or so . the band saw him , and came out to ask his mom if they could ride the scooter too . so i guess they all the band and my ex as a year old goofed off and took turns riding his scooter

teachers who were especially influencing , people online i ve found particularly interesting , etc . just a big mix of people who all left an impression for one reason or another .","113007":"i wasn t able to find this video , but just from what i ve gathered from the question and others answers , yes i believe the teacher crossed a line . i have no idea what the fight was about , how bad the fight was , etc . not having seen the video or having been there , so maybe the teacher felt they had no other choice in order to protect the other students before police or security or whatever could arrive , but even so it should have been done non violently .","113008":"my two most well liked posts tied at likes are a . gif of the rock wearing a fanny pack and an answer about emojis where i said

thought into had so little likes , but que sera , sera .","113009":"i think there must be something out there , but whether they are wild men or a type of primate or a separate thing altogether , i

basically everywhere . . . maybe","113010":"this happens every time i draw . it can happen occasionally while reading or playing a game , but it always happens when i m making art . it s why i prefer

whatever is one that definitely scares me haha . i know there s a billion variations of this urban legend and it s pretty unlikely that there s truth to it , or at least it s a case of extreme hyperbole but it still is one of those things i occasionally remember and get grossed out about . i m always interested in different variations of the sasquatch legends myths folktales .","113014":"i believe that there is much we do not know and can t explain . i ve had tons of personal experiences but i ve found it never matters what evidence you present , people are either going to believe you

things in the woods .","113015":"my grandmother had tons of old appalachian old wive s tales to tell when we were growing up , certainly . most seemed to indicate that you d either have generalized bad luck for however many years , someone was thinking about you , or you were going to receive a letter or gift . i don t believe in any of them , but i still think about them every time a situation comes up that involves one ear ringing , itchy palm , walk under a ladder , etc etc . i occasionally make up my own superstitions and then follow those , but that has less to do with reality or belief and more to do with obsessive and compulsive behaviors p","113016":"i always joke that i don t run for anything , even zombies so if they re fast , then i m in trouble . if there were an apocalyptic

incident . beginning in my mid teens , i have attracted that type of person . . i have nothing against anyone s faith or religious practices , and that includes the new agey set , but it s not really something i have much faith in myself . nowadays , i stay more vigilant about noticing what s going on around me so i can shut down mentally and use body language to discourage strangers approaching me about odd things but it still happens once in a blue moon . the palmist story is one of the few that really left a bad taste in my mouth , rather than just leaving me startled or amused like the others . i saw him a few bars down in louisville , ky while i stepped outside to smoke a cigarette at a karaoke bar on bardstown rd . about years ago . i had recently been diagnosed with unexplained infertility , after spending several years seeing specialist after specialist who couldn t determine what specifically was causing my reproductive system to give me so much trouble . anyway , a friend of ours uncle or aunt or someone owned a karaoke bar and i met a friend of mine and her mother out there with jon to blow off some steam . he was like , ish , skinny , pale , with intense eyes , longish blonde hair , and glasses . he kept trying to make eye contact , and he skeeved me out so i stubbed out my cigarette and went back in , walking immediately past my friends toward the back of the bar to use the restroom . when i came back out , he was sitting at the table with my friends and husband . i don t know how he knew who i was with . it was thankfully my turn up , so i sang whatever it was i had picked , and came back to my table . he was still there . he had read my friend and her mom s palms , and they were tipsy and thought it was funny and insisted i let him do mine . i gave in and handed over my hand kind in a kinda bitchy way . he had definitely crossed way too many lines already . he grabbed it and his hand was really cold . he traced a few lines with his finger and i yanked my hand back . he stood up , eyes wide , big dumb fucking smile on his face , and said you re gonna have a boy ! i was seething . i tossed back the rest of my beer , slammed the bottle down , wiped my mouth , stood up calmly while he s just still all elated , looking at me waiting for me to rejoice , and i told him to get the fuck away from me and never fucking come back . i had tears in my eyes . i told jon we were leaving . his face fell as it dawned on him that i wasn t celebrating and was like i didn t say that to be mean , i know you don t think you re going to but you re going to have a boy and that s what s supposed to happen . i left and it has bugged me since and yes i m still child free","113018":"waste more of it . i always feel rushed as it is now , and i know i have plenty of time to do things . i just can t get myself motivated to do them , or don t feel well enough , or planned my preparation time poorly , or was distracted by something out of my

it s really only because it s such a raw album and i think harnesses the best of both cale and reed . sister ray is iconic imo . that s not to say i dislike other albums i do enjoy the self titled album most for specific songs ferryboat bill is prob my favorite , but i think white light white heat has a more cohesive sound overall . the s t w nico i ll listen to once in a blue moon but all i hear is warhol s influence which i m not in love with .","113036":"i have it set to randomly select from a pool of about images and it changes every hour , but here s what it is now the rest are

anxiety . that leaves me most days with the choice of taking xanax instead and being unable to work because zombie , or just pushing through the waves of panic , which hasn t been easy . i m not sure

, i ll be a tree .","113064":"i was convinced i was straight until i was , despite a lifetime of major and intense crushes on both men and women . so i guess what i m saying is , it s entirely possible to have no clue what your sexuality is without really going inward and exploring those questions with an open mind . i grew up with an abusive mother who very vocally hated lesbians she has no problem with gay men just lesbians and i guess i just internalized that and was afraid of my attraction to women and accepted that i was attracted to men too and that was good enough .","113065":"i

there are a lot of great things in this world , even if it s hard to see that now . i recently heard of a service that i really loved the idea of , though i ve not personally used it . it s a crisis line that communicates in text messages , for those of us who have anxiety about talking on the phone . if that sounds like something that might help you out , i encourage you to use it , at the very least to find out what options might be available to you locally if you decide to seek medical help for your depression . it s http www . crisistextline . org get help now i take cymbalta an anti depressant and some prescription supplements for depression , and it worked really well for me . i ve cycled through tons of different medications to find one that worked , and sadly that is normal but it is worth it . it is such a relief to be able to reconsider things like goals again , and have thoughts that aren t centered about how i would kill myself in each current situation . i have also seen therapists in the past . each of these options or both together can really really help control depression , if those are options you can afford and access . the link i posted up their could be a valuable tool for finding low cost options too , i m sure , as they are trained to help . anyway , this is long . thank you for reaching out to me . you made the first and hardest step . next is

that i can pinpoint specific traits past obvious ones like be kind to other people and animals or don t be a complete douche canoe , i rely on gut feelings about people very heavily so you could be

definitely done this , and have lost jobs because of it . mental health has never really been something that any of my previous employers understood well at the time , with the exception of one shop

mostly a sort of painterly pixel style with the exception of the in game cards , which are a little more detailed . when i do art for myself , generally it s either just doodling on my tablet or

vitamins , over the counter drugs , over the counter vitamins , and cannabis . i don t mess with anything past that , unless things like diffusing oils because the smell of certain things helps me

listing . a year and a half of medication switching brought on about lbs . more than i expected , and for the first time since maybe puberty i ve been unfamiliar with my body in some ways like , i don t translate my size change mentally very well . i feel awkward , and a bit dysphoric . i m hoping now that i m on stable medications again , i will be able to lose some of it . crossing my swollen fingers . the reason for the med changes were that my anti depressants plateaued and before i had a handle on that , i suffered some traumatic medical news that ended up triggering some psychotic behavior i have ocd and episodic schizophrenia in addition to my major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder , as well as post traumatic stress disorder anyway it s been a hell of a year for me and my psychiatrist because nothing was working and the side effects were all intense and it was just a nightmare of ups and downs . during these sorts of psychological events , you end up needing huge amounts of time to just sort of go inward and re assess who you are . or at least , i do . during my inward phase , i admitted to myself that the only reason i ve never been able to let myself believe that i am attracted to other genders is because my mother s intense hatred for lesbians has had me terrified to disappoint her in yet another way . even though i tell myself i don t care about her opinions . even though i ve not spoken to her in years . so , that happened . i came out at age as a bisexual . but right after that , i started having some reoccurring dreams that i ve had throughout my life at different stages , in which i dream normal day to day sort of situations for me except i am male . i started really thinking about these and sort of obsessing about and tearing apart my feelings and making comparisons and realized that i really understood where the idea of gender fluidity comes from , because i can see myself at different times relating differently , or on a different scale to one gender or another throughout my life and i m comfortable with that . i still feel that i identify as a woman , but i decided to go ahead and change that bi announcement to pansexual instead because it felt like a more accurate description of how i newly felt about gender . also , my hair looks way better than it did last year . so basically , many changes .","113184":"i have a thing for large , crooked , or otherwise prominent interesting noses . my favorite feature of my husband s is his nose dimple . like nearly everyone else already answered , also , i do enjoy a good set of teeth with personality . every time i move and change dentists , i have to explain over again that i m not interested in braces , i ve grown to like my large , crooked teeth . i hate when i see someone restricting their smiles because they are uncomfortable with their teeth , it makes me want to just be nice to them and tell them dumb jokes forever until they have a good open mouthed toothy smile .","113185":"i must not follow a lot of dramatic people , i didn t realize that there was drama","113186":"hmmmmmm there are so many good breads and cheeses . breads and

bruh so honestly , you re not going to get a good answer out of me , this shit annoys me .","113189":"depends on the severity of the omitted truth i guess . does omitting it cause harm or destroy

horseshit , questions that aren t actual questions but just statements about my body , questions about sexual acts . . . those are the main ones . but then there are also other less obvious things i really wish people would stop asking , like anything involving children or parenting . please take me the fuck off your mommies lists i am soooo not interested in that mess . also , the really really tech y super philosopher paragraph answer required questions aren t really my cup of tea . i visit this site for entertainment in general whether to ask , read , or answer , and having to write a thesis paper isn t fun or relaxing . i do like silly questions , general questions , hypothetical questoins , questions about myself or my work or interests , etc . basically anything else aside from the above annoying ones are a ok .","113208":"i suppose the most meaningful ones to me are ones about things i consider strengths in myself , because it s especially nice to feel like someone noticed

something to do because i wasn t getting out of the house much at the time otherwise , and a woman came in to return something , i don t remember what it was . i was polite , we were chatting in a friendly manner , everything was going just like a normal transaction , and she mentions in passing that her daughter wants to go to art school . i say oh , that s awesome ! i went to art school as well . and this previously average polite woman without even changing her facial expression or anything smiles at me and lilts gosh , and look how fucking accomplished you are now , working customer service for a store , and at your age . i was stunned . i hadn t finished her transaction , so i canceled it and told her to get the fuck out of my store and then took my break . i didn t stay with the company much longer because i couldn t handle how terrible people can be .","113224":"my uncle served time for repeat duis . i had a friend years ago who went to prison for stealing a stick of

don t feel very romantic lately , and my honeymoon was nearly a dozen years ago and wasn t what dreams were made out of lol . we only had days off from work , so we ended up just going to cape fear , nc to stay on the beach for nights . it was april , and as is typical for april , it was cold and raining the entire time . i had my labret pierced then , but we were so exhausted after the wedding that we slept like the dead and i woke up at some point in pain with my husband s arm thrown over my face while he snored he tore my piercing . so there was that . we ate some good food and laughed about how bad everything was , though , so it s all good .","113228":"i m not exactly sure and i ve got more questions to burn through so i m not going to zillow it for confirmation but i ll guess that it s probably around , . i think this area is affordable . i ve lived in places that were way more affordable and way less affordable than here . when i shop i have a bad habit of not price checking items unless they re incredibly frivolous purchases , so i ve not noticed anything in particular . there was definitely a difference between prices of the same items at the same stores between the east coast and the west coast , but i expected that .","113229":"i occasionally have these big ideas for painting series that i end up never finishing and barely beginning but they always require research , and every time this happens i tell myself i m going to go back and learn even more about each of these topics past just what i particularly needed for the paintings and then i never do because of either time restraints , loss of interest , or forgetfulness . so far , these things have included gnosticism , mythology concerning persephone , native american north and south mythology concerning owls , worldwide mythology concerning sasquatch type creatures , catholic martyrs and saints who are female , and more !","113230":"i m always willing to entertain most ideas at least for a moment , but i can t think of any conspiracy theory in particular that i really subscribe to . i jokingly talk about reptilians and grays and sasquatch and can be a little bit paranoid about the government s extent of power on occasion i guess lol . the most ridiculous conspiracy theories are probably the ones declaring that all of these pop stars are illuminati .","113231":"eh , i m not really sure what i think about this to be honest . on one hand i can see their point , certainly it seems impossible to us and completely illogical to accept that regular human beings accomplished these things but on the other hand , who are we to judge what the people of that time are capable of ? why do we always assume that earlier humans were less intelligent than modern man ?","113232":"i do believe in ets , mainly just because it seems like if life was able to form here on earth , surely the same could happen on one of the other bazillion planets . so sure , there s a

now , so i have lists of chores that need to be done before we leave , lists of what to pack , lists of items not to forget , lists of chargers and toiletries and things to pick up from the store tomorrow . i have a white board in the kitchen with a cleaning schedule and a magnet marker that i can move down the list to indicate what day of the week it is and therefore what chores are due . i m not always the best at keeping up with everything , but it is all fairly organized .","113240":"it s important for children to have the vocabulary for their own anatomy , and to not feel uncomfortable speaking about it to their caregivers . i think it s perfectly fine to have funny names for things or whatever , my nephew misheard my sister s lesson on anatomy as a toddler and thought his nipples were meatballs for a while , which was adorable . . . however , a kid needs to be able to communicate clearly and with seriousness what their body concerns are whether that s to a doctor or a parent or whatever .","113241":"i do not . i ve been in a monogamous relationship for a dozen years though , so i mean , it can be done . for some , it s enough and they have a partner who provides every single one of their needs and who they provide every need for . for the average human , i think we rely more on small self made communities to fill out needs whether that s through friendship or flirtations or professional relationships or whatever . i don t see anything wrong with that . i know that with my illnesses , i am often a poor partner and i have asked my husband to please find someone to be close to for his sake and for mine , so i could feel like the guy i love is being fully cared for , but he s not really comfortable with that idea at this time .","113242":"lol because anything that feels good must be awful . some people deal in blacks and whites , some people stay in a grey area . when you believe in extremes heaven , hell god , satan good , bad then you feel like everything unexpectedly pleasurable must have an equally terrible counter .","113243":"i really don t know how to answer tbh . in some ways , yes absolutely it s great that like minded people can easily meet and safely discuss whatever it is they re into , but then you have shit like child pornographers exchanging footage in chat rooms or whatnot which obviously needs to be broken up . like everything , the internet is neither wholly good or bad .","113244":"no more than they are currently , no . little kids shouldn t be able to walk into a porn store , but i have nothing against sexually explicit materials produced by and for consensual adults existing more or less censorship free .","113245":"i don t mind slang , i just don t understand it anymore and i m now a crochety old lady i guess . i like bright colors and clean lines , but more artsy or kitsch than contemporary . the expressionists are my favorite painters , for the dramatic lines and focus on color and emotion . i enjoy when personality comes out in imperfect , bright , bold ways whether it s art , fashion , or design .","113246":"there have been times where less favorable slang terms have been used in private conversation with a partner and it s made me feel a bit devalued , i guess . but in general , i love slang , the worse the better .","113247":"i will not have children . i was uncomfortable talking about these things with my mom , but luckily i didn t have to often since mostly when these things came up it meant a trip to the library and me looking shit up on my own .","113248":"i m too old to know exactly what this means . i assume it s shortened from aesthetically pleasing but i never know what the fuck people are trying to say using the term aesthetic on tumblr or whatever . half

very specific mood for me to be romantic . mostly , i m more just like , a comfortable pal who sometimes is kinda sexy . lol . i m never comfortable talking about things like this , it leads to too many weird anons .","113259":"i ve said it before , but it never actually means that . it s just a polite way to say i don t want to discuss this with you . most people care about at least an issue or

crisis and they come to me they came to me because i am a comforting presence . i want to be like to be a comfort to people i care about when i am able . . i love that when things get really bad scary

, a big owl ring , and ruffled pink and yellow socks .","113272":"i took piano lessons as a kid and tried to learn guitar twice as a young adult but the problem each time was my tiny baby hands that can t stretch a full octave or reach all of the strings comfortably . i m really honestly considering learning to play the ukulele because i think it would suit my small hands .","113273":"currently , probably tarboush on se hawthorne in portland . everyone around here seems to have really strong opinions about lebanese food and i haven t tried some of the more popular places , but having grown up with lebanese food , i can say that this tiny little restaurant has the most authentic lebanese food i ve had anywhere besides my aunt alice s kitchen .","113274":"i ve been having a hard time coming up with an answer for this because i guess at this stage of my life i m just not very romantic but then i remembered our hamster kostya . about years ago , i found a hamster running away from a feral cat near the apartment dumpster and took him in . i had cats at the time , so i just kept a watch on things and kept his cage in a very secure place . after a while , i noticed that during ball time where i let him run around the living room in his plastic ball while jon and i sat on the sofa , he would go look for my cat rin every single time . i started paying more attention and apparently rin and kostya had a really close bond . she checked up on him frequently , kept the other cats away , liked to cuddle while he was in his ball , it was adorable then , as hamsters do , he died . he died in my hands , we had no idea how old he was when we found him but his teeth were very long , so i m sure it was just the end . he was wheezing and pooping and as i held him and cleaned him he just stopped being alive . rin mourned for months . slept curled up in the exact place his cage had been . perked up and investigated anything that still had a lingering smell of him . it was heartbreaking . rin really really loved that hamster .","113275":"i would take ayahuasca , but here in my home since i m not going to be punished for having illegal and super hard to get black market drugs here

skipping and this time not reading anything currently infertile , but lemme take a shot at here . i m not sure what a fulfilled life entails , or even where the lines would be drawn on material things if it was attainable . i would assume free time is the most important part of having a fulfilled life , so the bare minimum amount of things i could handle and still feel like my entire life wasn t dedicated to chores and drudgery would be running water modern plumbing , modern kitchen options stove , microwave , fridge , freezer , coffee maker , dishes flatware glassware cookware seem like ones i would be frustrated to be without , internet access and a way to access it , and of course an adequate amount of food , proper shelter , a place to rest , and basic toiletries . i guess then the extras i feel are fundamental to my lifestyle would be convenience foods , decent computer set up and fast internet , tools for art , small appliances electric griddle , toaster , crock pot , specialty skin care products and make up and things like that rather than the basics , and decorative and comfort items for my home . i m sure i m missing a lot .","113277":"i grew up with hunters and continue to have friends who hunt for sport . when it s done legally , within specific times and areas , and only for specific game that is over populated and can be used for food , then i m all for

article these days . i like mostly fiction , particularly the classics , historical fiction , occasionally fantasy or horror when i do read . my favorite book is demien by hermann hesse , just because it s very short and emotional and has meant a lot of different things to me over the years . i like a lot of hesse s other books as well . the most recent series i ve read was a fantasy trilogy that was really good . it s not like , new or anything , but i think it came out in the s anyway the first in the series is sabriel , i can t remember the offical trilogy name . i think the other books were liriel and abhorsen but i don t know if i spelled them right .","113279":"i could list words i just don t like , but it would be more fun to watch people have to create a new name for a well known object , so i m going to eliminate the word leg .","113280":"i used to always enjoy abstracted figure study type things , but lately when i ve drawn for me it s been birds . specifically the

new experiences motivate me to a small extent , in a vague need for exploration sort of way . love is always a motivator . kindness . being in tune with myself . i think i can be a motivating force ,

my husband s job in two weeks , time to get rolling . i use apartment listings online , then check google for neighborhood statistics , then check for reviews on apartmentratings . com . if i can find one that meets my needs , is in a good neighborhood , and has good reviews , then i call and reserve an apartment . money is always an issue of course , but we ve been lucky enough to have moving

do either .","113318":"i ve only broken bones not counting my toes , because it seems like i break a toe once every years , though there have been a bajillion strains , sprains , dislocations , tendons snapping , etc . because i am clumsy and unlucky . the bones i have broken in order are left index finger , which i broke being startled mid flip on a jungle gym and falling in an especially awkward way at a friends house in nd grade . right wrist , which i broke being reckless on a pile of fence posts because kid . th grade . some rib , because who knows with ribs . it wasn t worth our ridiculous co pay at the time for me to bother with x rays when unless i punctured an organ or something bonkers the result was going to be rest and try not to do anything that might prevent things

mentor , or friend comes to mind , i ve been quite good at gathering very bright people in my life . i know many smartest people . i m not sure what it is about some people i consider more intelligent or smart than others , but it s just an instinctual feeling for me i guess . some people grasp concepts easier than others . some people are able to see the bigger picture and make choices based on the good of all better than others . some people have more specialized knowledge than others . when you meet those people , something about them just seems brighter .","113320":"intelligence is defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills . i agree with the standard definition but might add that it s the ability to solve problems with the tools you have . i don t know that i d say there are different types of intelligence . maybe different kinds of ways to be smart about things . some people are smart in a has collected a ton of knowledge and applies that to their lives way , some people are smart in a used logic and creativity to survive way , etc . i don t know what i possess , really . the reason i was studied as a kid was because my iq was high but my problem solving didn t follow the same patterns as other people with similarly high iqs . when i was , i had multiple psychotic manifestations present themselves , which made problem solving more difficult because panic was introduced in many cases . i don t feel intelligent most of the time . i feel lost .","113321":"my only professionally administered iq test s were done during a series of studies that were performed on me in st grade . at that time , it was recorded as a general . however , iq lowers over time , and i ve had plenty of time pass since first grade lol . the internet tests i ve taken have varied wildly numerically but still placed me in a super genius or genius range . nah , i don t think the online tests are accurate , but not just because they re online tests i think iq is a pretty inaccurate measurement of intelligence .","113322":"i think i give pretty good advice i m absolutely terrible at taking good advice though .","113323":"i try not to cuss around

philosopher named pistorius who teaches him that every man s true calling is only to arrive at himself . i consider that a lot , especially lately as i ve been struggling back up from a fall into the pit of trauma memories , depression , and anxiety fueled issues . you learn so much about yourself in those sorts of situations , sometimes it s even quite shocking . arriving at the doorstep of who you really are and being comfortable with who you see when the door opens is something a lot of people shy away from doing or are unable to do , but it s what we re meant to do . or something . i am so tired right now .","113339":"music is quite important to me , but i m no music snob , and i don t like or dislike people based on their music preferences . music is more of a personal enjoyment thing , and i ve always connected certain times of my life with certain mixes of bands . i don t know that i could pick one most meaningful musician . i don t think i could even pick one musician per life stage that was more meaningful than others . it s about emotion and mood and memory and it s more of a living playlist that is my favorite rather than any one part of that .","113340":"i really kinda just enjoy letting travel situations happen as they happen , without a specific goal . like , i won a trip to lake tahoe last winter , and we had an amazing time but i would never have considered tahoe a place i especially wanted to visit prior to that . we wanted to see more of the us , and when my husband relocated from va to wa , we got to drive from ocean to ocean practically and see a huge chunk of states . my husband won a week in vegas once , and though we don t really drink or gamble we had a great time . travel just sort of happens for us . we only really plan local ish things , day trips and the like . i suppose part of me wants to go to brazil because of some family history , and england , but not so much that i d say it s something i consider extremely meaningful .","113341":"i have been in a couple , and they were the sort of drunken biker bar bathroom brawls that don t really have a winner but sure , i totally won . past that my early s were a pile of shit , the only fights i ve been in were having a knife pulled on me in middle school by michelle matthews in the art closet with her two sidekicks backing her up and being so full of herself that she didn t notice when i took the knife out of her hand and then threatened them with it and then tattled cause , nerd , a few situations in elementary school where girls would tell me to meet after school to fight and then i d show up and no one would be there but of course they told everyone they kicked my ass the next day , and a pretty terrible relationship where i was physically and sexually abused and he was an enormous fucking german i couldn t fight back against .","113342":"a pair of lime green running shorts and a grey tank top with bugs on it .","113343":"i love the idea of a seed vault the many mothers with their bag of seeds are one of my favorite parts of the new mad max movie , and here in portland , we have a rose test garden that was created similarly to protect hybrid and rare european species of rose during world war i in case of destruction . i feel like probably we already have genome data on file somewhere secretly for as many species as they ve been able to recently document , it just seems like the sort of thing some govt . or another would have started on by now , right ? shrug . maybe i expect too much from our governments secret programs lol .","113344":"oh , plenty of it is appealing . i used to be quite a heavy drinker in my early s . i love fru fru cocktails and a good cider but what i don t like is the sick , queasy feeling that comes with drinking , or the panic when i can t operate at my full capacity . i prefer smoking weed , where i can control my state of mind a bit better and not feel sick to my stomach a few hours later .","113345":"i don t really know . i m a middle income college drop out who doesn t drink , but it has nothing to do with my education level or income . . . i can afford to drink , but i choose not to

touch . i feel like being able to enjoy music , even unfamiliar music on weird instruments , would transfer over to alien species if they were able to hear feel it in a similar capacity as we can , or even in a different capacity but one that allowed for at least recognizing patterns and finding enjoyment in that after all , plants can enjoy music according to studies , so why not aliens ?","113350":"kind of . i am someone who definitely relies on gut reactions and first impressions when it comes to other people nowadays , which does mean that there are people i ve come across that i

blinds a little bit so that fresh air can blow in while we sleep .","113352":"i m allergic to penicillin , kiwis , mangoes , pet dander , most grass and tree pollens , and basically anything that brushes up against my skin including wind because i have this condition called dermatographism where my skin produces too much histamine when it s triggered and it s triggered by anxiety , and my anxiety is high , so i have to take an anti histamine every morning or else the sleeve of my shirt will cause a chain reaction ending with my arms and legs covered in welts or something equally ridiculous and annoying .","113353":"it feels like most of the people i talk to for a lengthy amount of time are the sort of people you just sort of have this on going conversation with anywhere from few minute to few day pauses , you know ? like i don t remember one especially long recent conversation , but i feel like i ve been in very long ongoing conversations with some people for years .","113354":"i think it s pretty common for not everyone to get along all the time , like having that uncle that irritates you or being angry at a sibling for a bit , but i have a mother and a brother i haven t spoken to or seen in over years and i don t think that s common . i attempted to befriend my brother s girlfriend on social media so that i could at least have some sort of relationship with

on her . my first grade teacher mrs . smith fought to get me into the gifted program because even though my iq is wayyyyy up there my mother was a hard sell on anything that meant she might have to put more effort in as a parental figure . because of mrs . smith , i was able to get an education more catered to my abilities . from there , i had mostly good teachers , a few stand outs mrs . sutton was a science teacher in middle school , mrs . french was a liberal arts teacher in th grade , until high school when i began attending governor s school for the arts , and spend the next years with a group of amazing teachers with three particularly who really saw into me and had hearts big enough to offer me the support and structure i desperately needed virginia van horn , peter thurston , jon petruchyk . from there , it was college , with another two teachers who really went the distance thorpe feidt and jen hilton . i kept in touch sporadically with thorpe , a few years with peter and jen , but not in ages jon sadly has passed , i m friends with virginia on facebook in the same aquaintance y way i am with a lot of other people i wish i had stayed more in touch with . however , they all

to live a relatively normal life , i can be pretty pro medication . however . i ve also spent years trying to find the right medication combinations to treat my illnesses and am still trying to sort out a good anti anxiety so i m well aware how scary and over the top some of the pills and side effects can be . not every prescription medication is created equal , and many can be quite dangerous . does that negate their necessity ? nah . it just sucks that there s such a wide variance of things that can go wrong when you really need something to go right . as for pharmaceutical companies , i think it really depends on the doctor hospital . when i lived on the east coast , i felt like more of my doctors were just throwing whatever cool new pill they were being sold on by reps that day at me , and it really sucked . i don t know if i just had particularly shitty doctors , or if they were just overworked , or what . since moving here , i ve noticed that my doctors have really been very good about staying up to date on research and a more holistic approach i . e . this pill might help , but it will aggravate this other ailment , so it s not going to be a good match instead of just prescribing whatever without worrying about how it ll affect everything else so i don t feel like pill companies have as much of an influence here . re answered to correct a typo","113367":"my

, but i ve never registered as a party member or anything . i do like bernie sanders though . recently i received a survey in the mail from the democratic party and i filled out the bits about my thoughts on certain platform issues , but i left the ones about my personal involvement with the party blank because i ve never identified as a dem and haven t voted for a democratic president i don t

making sure that i am not lying to myself or falling into a delusional cycle pretty vigilantly because of my tendency to fall into schizoaffective behaviors in times of depression and anxiety . it s a

i m going to be able to handle the content anyway . so yeah . i guess i don t have a favorite . that s not an open invite for every white boy with a youtube channel to add me on twitter and dm me links repeatedly until you finally give up , i ve had plenty of those already .","113397":"lowe s , because we had a pretty serious incident there several months ago and i have no idea if it was ever taken care of because their way of dealing with me was to be rude as fuck for the span of three weeks and tell me over and over that it would be handled internally . for all i know a man who tried to diminish my husband with gendered insults and slurs and then physically threatened me when he was alone with me later while calling me a bitch could be the store manager now . they refused to tell me what the outcome of their internal investigation was , so i refuse to set foot in another of their stores and so do my friends . lowe s hates women .","113398":"my husband works on sundays so it s like any other day of the week for me . mostly i do chores and mess around on the internet .","113399":"well , i already had dinner which was a number at carl s jr fast food and now i m very full . it s not what i would have chosen if i could have had anything i wanted , but i m not sure what that would be either because it s hard to think of food when i m not hungry lol . probably something middle

fix me the eff up or what","113406":"shrug . i guess i ve never really felt very patriotic , other than a sort of vague appreciation for living conditions here versus places that have it worse . it s kind of like sports but with nations , people getting all rabid acting over their team , so infatuated that they can t accept that other teams are pretty okay too .","113407":"i know she had a brand

know i personally am way more dependent on it than i want to be but i m lonely and depressed and it s all i ve got . maybe we re worse as a whole for it . maybe it s better to connect . i m not sure . i haven t really thought about the long term i just know that sometimes it s nice to be noticed by someone else on social media , it makes things feel less lonely . more often than not , though , i m just reaching out aimlessly and the people i m reaching for are oblivious don t care .","113412":"i would but it would be really hard . maybe that s what i need right now . someone pay me , to have to give up social media so i can buy a house and be creative and productive with my time .","113413":"once i decide to go to bed , i do a quick sweep of the apartment to grab any dirty dishes or whatever floating around , turn out lights , lock doors , check the cats water bowl , pee , brush teeth , apply deodorant , apply lip balm , and then lay there for a few minutes before conking out

of the things someone who seeks to raise their vibration might do and i assure you that although i smoke a ton of weed and have my astrology signs tattooed on my back like a good little woo woo i m not that person .","113419":"i don t even want to answer this because if i go one way someone else will be a passive aggressive jerk to me today about being too self righteous and i can t mentally handle it . if i go the other way i ll just feel like shit for not addressing the elephant in the room and i can t mentally handle that either . so whatever .","113420":"sometime last fall there was a magnetic storm big enough that we were supposed to be able to see the aurora borealis from here , so we drove out into gifford pichot natl . forest area and found a good spot up in the mountains to

peaceful fuck yeah , that s cool sort of reaction .","113423":"if you mean the documentary that i just found while googling to make sure this wasn t a band name , i have not seen it . if you mean the passage of time in general , i don t know what there really is to think about it . it just is . it happens . we re affected by it at the same rate for different amounts of time . sometimes it really sucks how fast or slow it seems . sometimes i feel old as fuck . sometimes i realize there s still a lot more time out there for me if all goes well .","113424":"i have no idea what this is in reference to or really what you re even trying to say but i ll agree that asses can be nice ?","113425":"no , probably not . if i get divorced for any reason i don t think i m going to be in a big

the other end of the bar , there s this guy with a big orange head . just kind of sitting there , mooning into his drink . so the man asks the bartender , say , what s up with the guy with the big orange head ? and the bartender says , it s an interesting story . buy him a drink and maybe he ll tell it to you . so the man walks over and introduces himself and offers to buy a round . the guy with the big orange head says , yeah , i ll bet you want to know the story , huh ? to which the man replies , sure , if you don t mind . the man with the big orange head sighs and says , you know , i ve gone over it in my mind a million times . basically , it s like this i was walking along the beach one day , when i stubbed my toe on something . i looked down , and there was an antique brass lamp . i picked it up and dusted it off a little when all of a sudden this enormous genie pops out ! the genie thundered , you have released me from my ten thousand year imprisonment , and i am in your debt . i will grant you three wishes as a token of my gratitude . the man at the bar is agape . the guy with the big orange head continues so i said , wow , okay . well , my first wish is to be fantastically wealthy . the genie says , your wish is granted . and all of a sudden i have rings on my fingers and a crown on my head , and my wallet is full of money and a dozen atm cards and the deed to a mansion in the hills i mean , i was loaded ! so i said , amazing ! okay , for my next wish , i want to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world . the genie says , your wish is granted . and the ocean parts , and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress , and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there . it was incredible . the genie booms , you have one wish remaining . the man with the big orange head pauses and sips his beer . he says , now , you know , this may be where i went wrong . i wished for a big orange head . i copied and pasted this from a joke site , because it s long and i m lazy , but it usually makes me laugh at any rate","113434":"i don t give a shit about morpheus , the matrix , or that meme set up in

nothing , and god isn t real . . . but you re a capricorn , so if you don t get straight a s you re getting your ass beat . my two only tattoos are from when i was , and i had my astrology signs done . i have rejected all of that in the years since , but it s still hard to not check my horoscope sometimes just for a bit of comfort , i guess . for this particular natal chart interpretation , i m going to read through and put the traits it mentions in true and not true categories true want to feel useful and effective , realistic , lonely , reserved , resourceful , strong sense of responsibility , deadpan humor , dependable , loyal , quiet , strong willed , doesn t take orders well , highly intelligent , fair , offended by rage , trustworthy , open minded , depressed ,

passionate about de stigmatizing mental illness . i am passionate about art being necessary in the community . i am passionate about social justice , being kind to those you can afford to be kind to , the importance of quiet reflection , the oxford comma , and how adorable owls are . life is given meaning through the connections we make , our ability to learn , and the truths we collect about ourselves as we pass through life . i m not doing anything towards anything lately . i m just trying to balance out .","113448":"nope . i have been of a different religion than every single one of my major relationship partners and only one of them ever tried to force me to convert . . . and hey guess what , he s also the one who forced me to do other traumatic things ! people who can t accept

i could choose .","113450":"i think traveling across the country to live without having ever been here before was brave enough for this lifetime . i miss enough people often enough as it is , i wouldn

themselves","113453":"it s probably easier to do that , sure , but i don t seem to be able to operate that way . my sister does if she can spin something to be a positive thing , or convince herself that there s a sunny side , she ll do it , and she seems mostly happy except in spurts when it builds up too much so it must work for her . for me personally it s always been easier to just be open . it might scare some people away or make some people uncomfortable but at the same time it clears out those without empathy or kindness in them quickly so the people i do end up spending time with are generally good , understanding people who aren t going to get grossed out when i m ugly crying because something triggered me on a bad day .","113454":"thank you for asking , lydia , because this is certainly one of the many mental health disorders that people like to make light of and i hope it s just ignorance and not purposeful ableism . the main thing i wish more people understood is that there are many many different possible types of obsessive compulsive disorder . there are type names that try to act as an umbrella over all of the possible manifestations of ocd , but they don t catch all of them . those types are checking , hoarding , ruminating , and contamination . most people are somewhat familiar with hoarding type ocd because of tv or whatever . contamination type is another ocd type that most people have at least a vague understanding of . this type covers ocd behaviors like hand washing , organization , extreme fears of germs , fear of public toliets , refusal to participate in hand shaking , fear of touching door knobs with bare hands , etc . something most people are not aware of is that this can also mean mental contamination , where the person with ocd feels contaminated for less obvious reasons . this could be because of abuse or molestation , breaking rules of strict religious beliefs , etc . where the person feels defective or unclean and continuously tries to find ways to physically clean off the emotional contamination . checking ocd covers things like compulsively checking locks , knobs , alarms , stove tops , lights , safety checks etc . but it can also mean checking relationship statuses compulsively are you mad at me ? do you still love me ? etc checking on the safety of loved ones , checking information you ve read over and over because of fear that you won t remember , checking and double checking memories or past stories to make sure they are real , and infinite other possibilities involving doubting your ability to do something correctly whether it s keeping your home protected or being a good spouse or whatever else . rumination ocd is also sometimes called intrusive thought ocd . rumination ocd leaves a person obsessing over a specific train of thought . that thought could be literally anything bad things happening to the people you love specific times in history theological questions superstitious beliefs etc . some examples would be being afraid to interact with children because you re afraid you ll accidentally injure them , constantly tallying your sins and worrying that you ll never be good enough in god s eyes , believing that stepping on cracks in a sidewalk will literally hurt your mother and worrying over any you accidentally step on for long periods of time , being absolutely convinced that your partner is cheating on you with no proof and letting it run your life . most people with ocd suffer from several different manifestations , and that can change over time . some people with ocd can remain symptom free for long periods of time , and have them triggered again by depression or anxiety or for no reason at all . i m running out of characters so that ll have to do","113455":"my opinion is that people should do wtf they want to with their own bodies , though i do think it s considerate to stay clean and hygienic if you re going to be intimate with someone . i have nothing against body hair on another person . i remember feeling shamed when a partner suggested i shave everything down there a million years ago . i find i disagree with most any of society s expectations if they have to do with a person s individual choice on a private and petty matter like how to groom body hair . i personally shave pits , legs , and genitals , pluck my eyebrows and a couple of chin hairs , and use a depilatory cream on my upper lip but it s less for appearance and more because i have ocd and that often for me manifests in compulsive skin picking and it s way worse if i feel certain textures of hair along skin areas i expect to be smooth .","113456":"i thought they already decided it would be harriet tubman ?","113457":"basically everything i do is uncool

a very delicate balance to keep me from the darker sides of my depression . i take a snri , thyroid hormones , prescription level folic acid if i were to buy drugstore folic acid as a replacement , i d be going through about a bottle of pills a day , and i smoke marijuana daily . i m in regular contact with my team of doctors . right now , this is what it takes to fight off the depression enough that i can rationalize through my issues and survive it . i m working on finding the right balance for the anxiety now . here s the thing though . i ve tried half a dozen ish times . to end it . twice , i came really fucking close . i remember those times . there wasn t a peaceful feeling and my loved ones in the light . there was the soul crushing feeling that everything was wrong and i had to get back . there was emotional pain that i can t even describe . it felt like i was ripping my spiritual body apart trying to cling to the physical because on every level of existence , i had made a mistake . maybe that s just my own brain s chemical reaction to death . but i ve talked to a few people who ve experienced the same . we re not meant to go that way .","113461":"be quiet and draw your

stop since he got home today . i m excited for tacoma , but also been excited for it so not that much of a change . i hear there s been a lot of diversity on stage this year , so that s great . . . .

where i grew up and lived most of my life , but when i was back east it wasn t unusual for my husband and i to have dinner with one of my exes and their date here and there as friends . i would prefer all of my relationships have worked out this way minus one person but sometimes things just aren t salvageable . i have a lot of faith in the concept of soul groups and reincarnation , to a degree , though it s not something i like to talk about here . i will say that when i feel a very strong connection to someone i do try my best to keep that connection open in some way even after romantic

back to the living . but really i don t know you anon but i hope you re okay .","113492":"i hate to be such a stoner but i think the last time i felt like mind blown was while touring a buddy s legal

family history of each hybrid , it s medical properties , it s pros and cons , and the cloning and growing itself hydroponics and hand watering , drying , just everything . it s such an intense process but the result is really amazing weed with government approval , so shrug .","113493":"the art history classes i had through the years focused pretty heavily on the renaissance and then again on the years between the two world wars , so i guess those two periods . or at least , an extremely euro centric knowledge of those periods . however . my memory is crappy and sometimes , i feel like

in any way connected to or a part of the tattoo body mod community or anything , so i am just talking from my perceptions here that there s been a pretty steady change since the early aughts away from impulse tattoos in any old shop on the bad side of town while drinking with your buddies to a more refined experience overall . potential clients are more likely to research not only the shop but the artist they ll be working with , and build a relationship with them over each piece . i mean , i m sure there are still regrettable tattoos being had at sketchy places , but overall it seems like it s become definitely more of a creative and well planned process .","113501":"my second job ever was working in a piercing studio jewelry store . i ve had my labret pierced but took it out years ago

, or maybe save for a house . if i were able to get a house , i d really like to plant a big garden of herbs and flowers that can be distilled down for essential oils to sell use rosemary , basil , peppermint , spearmint , chamomile , lavender . if i have enough land yard , i d like to grow extra chamomile because there s a small but steady market for dried flowers around here for the tea

. i had a bad childhood and strings of terrible luck in both health and relationships throughout my younger years . my health continues to suck . i wanted to be an artist when i grew up . i didn t think i d ever actually grow up . adulthood has been a series of long stretches of pretending i ve known what i was doing speckled with times where mental illness held me down in one way or another .

owl figurine he has warm fuzzy memories about his aiya . i hope my sister remembers me as the big sister who would get stung in the swimming pool by scooping up and protecting her from floating wasps

daily life , and my anxiety reaches levels that cause major physical health concerns . second on that list are people who insist that i m too young to have the medical conditions i do . yeah , most women don t have to have mammograms until they are , but i have had and i m . my age doesn t matter to the three tumors , category mass , and countless cysts making their home in my breasts that need monitoring . telling me i m too young doesn t make the problems go away . yes , most women don t need to worry about brittle bones until after menopause , but osteomalacia affects many younger adults . telling me i m not old enough just serves to make me feel even more broken and fragile . the only major health concern of mine currently that i never get told i m too young for is having sacro iliac joint dysfunction , because i guess anyone of any age can mess up their back . what is helpful is not making a big deal out of things . i look normal . i do normal things . i have normal emotions and

actually a little disappointed that selfies and cosplayers are my most popular pics , i have been to so many beautiful places in the past few years and a lot of those photos didn t get the love they deserved lol .","113618":"i was a shitty garbage punk rock teen in the mid late s so green jelly , obviously .","113619":"i feel frustrated pretty often , actually . i have a lot of medical limitations that keep me from being able to do everything i feel i should be able to do , as well as a lot of mental baggage that makes me think there are walls standing in my way when there might not be . i deal with it through medication and taking breaks , which is to say my method of dealing with frustration is pretty hit or miss .","113620":"my freshman year of college roommate and i found a set of old golf clubs and a bag of kinda gross apples while on a walk in the middle of the winter in massachusetts . the only place cleared close by to have any fun was our own parking lot , so we were golfing apples into a snow drift but a few most smashed open somewhere in between and a few bounced on ice and hit things so we got yelled at but it was probably the only fun i ever had outdoors in a mass . winter .","113621":"it s an owl s head on the front of a locket . i bought it on etsy ages ago from this seller https www . etsy . com shop birdznbeez but it doesn t look like she has

interested in that at least one or two people in the inner circle don t know about , i m pretty open . i guess there are a few things that maybe not everyone i m close to knows as far as what i m interested in , even if a couple do . those things would be beekeeping and one day being a beekeeper , learning how to make essential oils from home grown flowers herbs , rollerskating , wanting to learn coding , women , smoking cannabis . . . . i can t think of anything else . at my age , nothing is that shocking to anyone i don t think , or i expect it won t be so i don t bother bringing things up unless it comes up .","113625":"a picture someone on tumblr took from the air of a dick shaped crop circle . i m not proud at how much i laughed , but in my defense i m pretty high .","113626":"i feel like this is a good question in a string of good questions that for whatever reason i m completely unprepared to answer and don t have really knowledge on the subject whatsoever but rather than let it rot in my unanswered questions bin i ll just say , hrm , good question , i m not really sure . looks like some other people i follow received your question too and had very thoughtful answers , though .","113627":"a guy from a little over thousand years ago who had some good advice about treating each other better and was punished for it .","113628":"i just hope things get better than they ve been .","113629":"i m not currently employed .","113630":"firstly , i m not sure what her age is , but if she s a minor then talk to your guardian . that s the number one thing you need to do so that they can take action to help protect her . if she s an adult , and especially if she lives with the boyfriend and is being abused , then it s a bit tougher . try not to get frustrated with her unwillingness to talk or her insistence that she doesn t need any help , it s possible that she is afraid that it s her fault , that she deserves the abuse , that she ll be killed or hurt worse if anyone finds out , or any number of other fear and trauma induced reasoning that might not seem logical to you but it s how she s surviving . what you can do is let her know that you want to help her in any way you can , and that she is important and loved and has other options . if you have a family and friends that are close who also have concerns or have voiced the opinion that they fear that she is being abused , then maybe some sort of intervention focusing on how she has a support net to catch her no matter what could be a good idea ? but really , i don t know what to tell you . i ve been in her situation but i had no help or support so i know how important that can be . start keeping notes on what you notice as far as bruises , strange behavior , illegal activity on his part , etc . anything that could be helpful in a case against him if it comes to that . sadly and disgustingly , the police won t do shit for just bruises . they ll want extremely clear and incriminating proof of abuse . . . hospitalization , video of him hurting her , eye witnesses , etc . good luck , sorry i m not the best help in the world , i m certainly no expert on this or anyone who can do much for you","113631":"i guess i d go into survival mode and figure something out , or at least i like to think i would . maybe i d accidentally get eaten by a bear or something . maybe i d give up out of loneliness . i like to think i wouldn t try to take my own life because i ve been there before and it s always ended up with my last conscious thoughts before being revived being ones of sheer regret and panic because i d changed my mind .","113632":"hmmm . maybe ? i don t like small spaces though so i d be a terrible assistant since the only illusion i can think of right now that isn t essentially a lady in a box is the bullet catch .","113633":"brilliant but troubled .","113634":"everything reminds you of the person you re in love with , and every reminder of that person makes you feel warm and happy and like you have a place in the world .","113635":"i ve touched on it before , but my childhood was not that great . i was the oldest child of a narcissistic mother , who was the product of an abusive childhood as the oldest child of a narcissistic father . i served the role of golden grand child to my grandfather , while being the hated scapegoat to my mother . i learned to read at age and was really advanced as a kid , even as far as being part of some weird top secret iq study in st and nd grade and then going to a specialized academically gifted school from nd to th grade i switched to an art school in th grade . but while technically i m a super genius or whatever , it s in areas that people don t normally score as high during testing ? like , i m super smart in things like spatial reasoning but will fail horribly if you put an advanced math equation in front of me . so i ve always felt kind of dumb because while i was still smart by most standards , i wasn t what my mother and grandfather expected me to be . from him , i felt like i constantly let him down . when he was let down , i received extra abuse from my mother , who was always ready to cut me down as much as possible anyway because i look like my dad and not her . this taught me to never be proud of my accomplishments unless i had my grandfather s approval and therefore , my mother s acceptance . it s honestly taken years and years of my adult life trying to reverse that . i try to let myself feel proud of small things , even cooking a decent meal , getting my chores done before the afternoon is finished , etc just to try to make up for all of the times i put my all into something as a kid and it wasn t enough .","113636":"i really hope so but i don t know . i teeter on the edge of hopeful and having no faith in humanity .","113637":"since it says any i ll assume that this means past or present . . . i wanna be on the muppet show . i don t care what role or in what capacity .","113638":"haha probably not anymore , i have a messed up back .","113639":"i m not a big fan of sports . like , i enjoy playing them sometimes , i was in the tennis club in middle school and i used to play pick up softball , volleyball , disc golf , soccer , and capture the flag games in college when i could and the weather was nice , but i haaaaaaate watching other people play sports and i have this kind of dread associated with sports because of elementary school bullies who always picked me last for being a nerd even though i wasn t even that bad at whatever we were playing , so i just sort of became apathetic to trying or caring anymore . that was sort of an unnecessarily long and rambling answer , sorry lol .","113640":"by gathering at balls and parties where they could focus on the social niceties and pretend that women and minorities weren t being treated as sub human . also , card games parlor games were pretty big i think .","113641":"surprisingly not really . i ll burn , don t get me wrong , but i also tan very easily and quickly i just choose not to because i ve had a malignant mole removed before and cancer is scary","113642":"nah , love is simple . what we do with it , how we react to it , the lies we tell ourselves about it , and the restrictions we believe in or set up for ourselves because of it are what s complicated .","113643":"nah the two oldest turned in april though and felt like a good milestone to be really silly about it . packed little tissue paper gift with catnip and treats and toys and everything . they were pretty bothered

i ve had emotional reactions to art . i ve cried , laughed , felt repulsed . i threw up in a trashcan at the dali museum in florida ! when i saw my favorite kokoschka painting in boston , i literally fell to my knees . i ve always had a strong love of fine arts , having attended various art schools from th through th grade and then an art college .","113647":"the moment they create something with artistic intent , i guess .","113648":"questions like these make me feel like i m going to aggravate both the very religious and the very anti religion . i am never very forward with my religious thoughts usually because it just isn t very important to me to debate or talk my thoughts out on the subject , it s a personal thing and i loathe being judged for that . but , i m interested in this question tonight so i ll answer . god is who we make of them . if you believe god is dead , then they are dead . if i believe god is a vague collection of strange energies that may or may not influence us in any way then god is a vague collection of strange energies that may or may not influence us in any way . i believe in god in that i believe that many of us need rituals and codes and a feeling of connection . that god is never going to be the same for you as it is for me , or for that guy over there , or whatever . i guess basically i m saying sure , god is dead . but god is alive too . god is whatever and nothing .","113649":"i feel like i used to have more opinions about this , but honestly i have no idea what s happening with education nowadays as i do not have children and

because my crappy sofa hurts my dysfunctional si joints and i m too broke to replace it .","113659":"i m a romantic in that i m usually hopeful , i try to see good in people , and i enjoy sentiment and intimacy , but i think it s rarely as pure or concentrated as it once was . lately i feel doubt and cynicism about people and issues and relationships more frequently than i did when i was younger

beautiful everything in the pacific nw is . wa , or , and northern ca are astonishingly gorgeous . the wild cold pacific , the deserts , the forests and rain forests , the snow capped volcanoes , the ferns and moss and wildlife this is really the prettiest place i ve ever lived . here s a photo i took in wenatchee national forest , wa . the creek is called devil s creek . i pulled over to the side of a road to take this like two years ago .","113672":"an empty early morning ocean beach or deep in the woods . when i lived in virginia beach i would wake up at am a few times a week during the summer and drive down to sandbridge beach before the parking attendant got there free parking yay and watch the sunrise . i d sort of snooze for an hour and then take a swim and then go home . it was peaceful . i was usually the only person around other than morning joggers . i don t live close enough to the ocean for that sort of thing anymore , and the pacific is much colder than the jet streamed atlantic . now , i enjoy being in the woods , just walking and being quiet .","113673":"i wasn t engaged before we got married , so all we wear are plain silver bands . so there s that , and i have piercings in each ear the bottom lobe holes i change out to go with outfits but the remaining three in each ear hold a tiny assortment of silver owls , stars , and hoops . i generally wear a silver and labradorite cabochon ring unless i m dressing up for a particular reason and it doesn t fit in . i have a few other rings i switch in and out occasionally but not lately . i used to always wear a little silver necklace with an abstract owl charm on it but lately my skin has felt to sensitive to deal with it .","113674":"observing how different their personalities are . rin is our dominant girl who likes to demand special treatment and talk back . kyo is daddy s boy and is afraid of everything . mimi is the bumbling brave kitty who wants to be in the middle of everything . sometimes they get along , sometimes they don t . kyo and mimi often challenge rin for the head cat position and fail . rin likes rodents squirrels but hates birds . kyo guards the hall bathroom from strangers because for some reason he s determined that that belongs to my husband only . mimi begs for table scraps like a puppy . they re all ridiculous .","113675":"i do not watch have not read this

important , and the right age is , i dunno , like years before puberty even thinks about beginning ? kids need to know what s going on with their bodies . early sex ed should probably focus on anatomy and what changes to expect . i feel like by the time they re late pre teens , like , they should have a clear understanding of what stds are and how serious some can be , should already understand how and why their bodies work , how a baby is made , and what contraceptives are available .","113679":"i d feel safer with guns in the hands of the average citizen more than i do with guns in the hands of our police force . i am undecided on the gun control issue . i enjoy target shooting . i have hunters in my family . everyone i grew up with s families had guns , and we all are just fine . however , gun violence is pretty serious . i don t really know what the solution or the happy medium is .","113680":"yes , i absolutely think that animal testing is justified in major medical research situations . for cosmetics and skin care ? not so much .","113681":"no , i m not a supporter of the death penalty . i say that knowing full well that there are people out there who are evil to their very core . people who in all honesty probably should be sentenced in such a way . people who have done unthinkable things . they re still people , though and it s still murder .","113682":"it s strange , because i was raised in a predominantly atheist household with a bit of woo woo astrology weirdness thrown in , so the concept of heaven and hell and that sort of afterlife belief was really foreign to me . my family did not believe in any sort of afterlife at all , and that always gave me some degree of anxiety so i avoided really thinking about it for a good portion of my life . i guess , if i have to pinpoint what i believe , it s probably more along the lines of reincarnation , except without the nirvana heaven like end goal . just maybe information and energy passed on somehow . i identify as agnostic mainly because i really don t have any clear answers about what i really believe , i just feel sort of gut feeling led on these things whether that s for my own comfort or whether that s my personal truth or what .","113683":"like i kind of don t even want to say this because i feel like it ll just bring on abuse i don t have time or need for , but i ll answer anyway . i found the matrix to be boring and predictable . strictly as a movie showcasing action and effects , it could have been okay , but the movie took itself soooo seriously with this pseudo intellectual crap and blech .","113684":"the first time i had indian food . i don t remember the name of the restaurant but i was i believe and my friend justin and i were in richmond va and stopped to eat . we had vegetable pakota , saag gosht , and mango lassis . it might not have even been amazing food , but the flavors and spices and everything about it was so good to me . still one of my favorite cuisines for sure .","113685":"i only saw the first saw and part of the second one and that was approx . a million years ago . i may be totally wrong , but didn t the victims all have some sort of crime they got away with and were paying for from this vigilante psychopath with a puppet ? i guess i would try to play judge myself . find out what the man did as his unforgivable crime . weigh it against my own . if he was like , a child abuser or a rapist or something , hell yeah his dick is coming off . if he did something really really awful against another person , probably he gets cut . otherwise , then he s no worse than me so i guess goodbye foot .","113686":"honestly , i don t know if i do or not ! i haven t been since i was a kid . i have ocd and while it stays treated when my meds are balanced out sometimes i do have issues with feeling or seeing things on my skin that i perceive as dirty so that might be an issue . my husband definitely wants to save up for camping gear since we live in such a great place for it , so i hope we ll get to try it out sometime in the not so distant future . deleted and re answered because i m half asleep and made an annoying typo","113687":"other than going to pax prime we haven t really planned anything for this year to look forward too , and i sort of look forward to that but at the same time . . . . ehhh . social anxiety and gators . so i

most recently are neverending nightmares , sentris , nuclear throne , off peak , skyrim , pokemon shuffle . i m watching a friend stream h z right now but i don t think i d necessarily enjoy that one . the next game i want to play is fallout . i skipped a lot of the consoles most gamers grew up with because of a busy high school and college life , but i grew up with atari favorite game yars revenge and nes shadowgate was my favorite nes , and of course mario after college i messed around with some console games but really it s been mostly pc games since then . so basically , the short answer is all of em , potentially , unless it s console only .","113693":"it won t be saturday for me for another . hours , but i assume tomorrow i ll be doing about what i do every saturday cleaning

black jellybean since they re my favorite , but my mother likes them so that won t work p i guess my answer instead is any type of ginger candy , because i eat it a lot . switching meds so frequently for the past year has caused a lot of random nausea and stomach probs so it s good to have around . i like the taste , too . . . spicy , but comforting and classic at the same time .","113702":"i can t narrow it down to one favorite artist . i love basically the entire german expressionism movement the best . i can tell you my favorite painting , though , and that is two nudes lovers by oskar

old and grumpy .","113705":"i m aware of trends as much as any one else is without trying too hard when suddenly everyone i see is wearing something that they weren t wearing last week , then it s

cancer and passed , mimi is with us now mimi being short of mikan . we had a hamster named kostya , so to be fair to the cats i should probably name any other rodents with russian names as well . we ve not had a dog yet , but will probably adopt an adult dog when we re able so they generally have names already .","113713":"i know it sounds like a cop out answer but i really can t decide . i know

every hour or hours or whatever you set it up to do , so i actually use about backgrounds mostly owls that change once an hour i ve been using the app for three separate phones now , and the only time i ve ever run into an issue with it was when i tried to use a live wallpaper , so i don t know about that mess .","113725":"i was lucky enough to have two mentors , one in high school and one in college . both were male . both were much older . both were artists . both were good enough to keep the relationship between us as mentor student until i left the schools they were associated with . both then took a bizarre turn . the first sent me love letters with gifts and jewelry beginning several years after i graduated , but since he sent them to my mother s address and not my college address she of course read and kept them , and freaked the fuck out i probably would have to to be honest , but i still hate that she read my shit . the second was less creepy and more of just a straight forward explanation that he divorced his wife who was one of many wives because she wasn t cool with his sex addiction , and now that we were peers i should come by and visit . i declined and we just never really talked anymore . on a positive note , both gave me several years of learning that i was lucky to have . both gave me confidence and strength and made me feel supported in my endeavors , which is something my mother never did . point of my rambling is mentors can disappoint the fuck out of you , no matter how much you look up to someone that someone is still a human being with flaws .","113726":"i worked in a piercing studio from to . in a military town . there are so many piercings i used to want but in just that short amount of time in the studio i cleaned up vomit

i ve eaten recently . i just made this sound so complicated .","113733":"omg enough with the baby voice , i m not a cutie wootie little fluffy butt , i m a grown ass animal","113734":"not regularly , but i have in the past and probably will again one day . the games i have on my ipad currently are mtg , draw something , french girls , blendoku , alpaca evolution , and crossy road . i finished alpaca evolution at . i haven t started crossy road but it s by the same dev who made goty blaze it so i m sure it s a win . blendoku is a great game but you really need to have perfect or close to perfect color acuity . i want to start playing french girls more , because i need to practice drawing more . the android games i have on my phone currently are flappy doge and wold of goo . i have not started world of goo , and i dl d flappy doge because it was really funny to me at the time .","113735":"no one , at least , i don t think i do . i got mad at vine for some reason when it first came out and although i can t even remember why , i uninstalled it and haven t thought about it much since because instagram ended up coming out with a similar feature anyway .","113736":"there are plenty of things i really hate paying for , but still do so begrudgingly things i wish i could refuse to pay for and still have access to education . water . medicine . . . stupid things i wish i didn t have to need buy i definitely do need and it makes me mad that i have to spend money on them ugly support bras for my tumor sacks , toilet paper , pads tampons , basic hygiene items . i pay for it all though , and just grumble .","113737":"i m not sure who my favorite actor is . i don t watch a ton of movies lately and no one really springs to mind . . . oh wait , except for kyle maclachlan . so there . agent cooper is my favorite actor . musician . . . . the opposite problem is happening here , i can think of a trillion but i have no idea who to narrow it down to . generally i ll answer best band of all time ? with the pixies , so i guess maybe frank black black francis is in the running for favorite musician ? along with joni mitchell , jeff buckley , mark mothersbraugh , lady gaga . . . . i dunno . that s more or less my answer i guess .","113738":"probably . i feel like that s where we re heading , right ? we ve begun privatizing space travel , seems like trying to get to and either occupy or mine other planets and asteroids and such is the next step . i lean towards believing that there are humanoids on other planets somewhere already if that counts .","113739":"no !","113740":"i dunno , i guess honey mustard or something vingar y","113741":"one at a time barely .","113742":"sometime between pm and am","113743":"i try my best not to appropriate too much from other cultures , and that includes this cutesy hipster pc nightmare . i saw a woman i respect very much , ijeoma oluo ijeomaoluo on twitter deflect this question once by replacing the problematic spirit animal with a nerdier but infinitely more acceptable patronus , so we ll do that . my patronus would be a great horned owl bubo virginianus here s one that s had it with people stealing spirit animal from the cultures where it actually means something sacred .","113744":"the not peanut butter way .","113745":"keep trying to learn , i guess . i feel like there s much i don t know lately .","113746":"one , and i ve not bothered to learn which remote even turns it on . i only really watch shows via netflix or amazon and i only do that really with my husband when we eat dinner at home which is probably a bad habit but that s what we ve done for years .","113747":"i m not sure i really have friends .","113748":"i don t think i m especially selective , but then again i guess most of the books i ve read have been recommended in one way or another either by someone i know saying hey you should read this or someone i respect listing their favorites or something else . so maybe that is the case . but then again , someone recommended catch to me , so . . . . shrug .","113749":"if it s non fiction , i don t feel bad about only reading parts , but as far as fiction goes i will almost always finish the book . the one exception to this out of the hundreds of books i ve read was catch by joseph heller . i know several people who say this is their all time favorite book and i cannot understand how . i found it soooooo boring and hard to lose myself in because of the way it s narrated . don t think i even made it halfway .","113750":"brave .","113751":"anglerfish because the females of the species are bad ass sharp toothed monsters with bio luminescent lures and the males of the species are tiny little parasites that have to cling to the females to survive .","113752":"enough is enough translates roughly to rawwwr grrr grawl rawwwr in brownbear . be very careful of your pronunciation , though , because it is very easy to accidentally say fight me motherfucker","113753":"other people . and spiders .","113754":"bees . one of my serious goals in life is to buy an acre or two and keep bees .","113755":"i really try to be polite and kind as much as possible , but i also have some social anxiety so occasionally it comes across weird or my timing is stupid . . . . but as far as a specific example , i took public transit into portland yesterday with my husband , and on one of the trains a young homeless couple got on and sat across from us carrying all of their clothes and everything in their arms . i didn t have any cash or food or anything but i remembered i did have one of those nylon bags from ikea that fold up and expand out to a large shopper bag in my purse so i tried to give it to the girl to carry some of the clothes in but she seemed really embarrassed and turned it down then i was embarrassed but nah , it was intended to be kind gesture and it was her right to do whatever so it s all good .","113756":"so much that my biology lab partner spread a rumor that i was a vampire because i was pale , had goth friends , and slept during the day . through all of high school , though , i was also attending a second high school that was focused on fine arts , so i d have to go to regular hs in the mornings , rush to catch a bus downtown , take college art courses until like pm , and then bus home . that meant two schools worth of homework , and i was also working hours a week once i turned , so i needed those school naps .","113757":"i am trying to draw all of the backyard feeder birds for my region i think there s like , or so . i have finished . i have no real reason for doing this other than i felt like it one day and now i m just trying to see it through lol .","113758":"i think some social scientist someone or other said last year or the year before that the number is around , but i tend to have smaller groups of friends so i dunno .","113759":"i had skin cancer on my butt and it left a tiny scar on my otherwise perfect butt so fuck the sun . i need bigger guns .","113760":"everyone i know is cute as hell","113761":"if my feet are cold , sure . i like those half toe toe socks that have the grippy things on the bottom , for yoga or whatever , because sleeping in them keeps your feet warm but your toe nailbeds dry .","113762":"one of my three cats , kyo , even though he didn t deserve it because he was on the kitchen counter .","113763":"i m in the middle of re reading demian by hermann hesse . the last book i completed was . . . . um . . . either a user s manual for procreate or holly green s video game cookbook which can be purchased here https itunes . apple . com us book fry scores id ? mt","113764":"i don t know ! i love a lot of veggies ! but the hands down worst vegetable is a bell pepper , blech","113765":"thank you","113766":"letting pain get in the way of progress more often than i should .","113767":"i got a christmas card from yoko ono in . my mom dated the bassist of some shitty one hit wonder band from the s called head east briefly when i was a kid . headbutted wesley willis in . have met tons of musicians and artists and writers briefly via this or that . but i m not close to anyone famous .","113768":"if you mean like , do i have that disorder that makes me crave and eat weird things , then the answer is no . if you mean like , accidentally ingesting a little piece of wrapper or whatever , then the answer is probably yes . if you mean something else , then probably not ? i m old and un hip so if that s a drug reference i didn t get it .","113769":"a very distressed street woman stopped me and a friend once in the mid s to beg for our help stopping them from eating the children for breakfast . i don t know who they are . or why they couldn t eat cheerios like everyone else . at any rate i was like , , so i didn t really know what to do and just hustled away after muttering some sympathetic sounding things .","113770":". . . and i wish i felt well enough to focus on games more . but whatevs it s honestly strange to me that my twitter persona is expected to be like , all games all the time by most of you . i started to make games with a friend , but several really terrible things happened and kinda fucked us both over and that s not happening now . i play games , i grew up with games , and i love games and i have literally been doing so since most of my followers were even born . so yeah , i will post about games sometimes , and i follow a lot of game makers or other people in the industry but i also follow a lot of local government tweeters and pro cannabis tweeters and people i know irl , and just random other shit , and none of those other facets of my twitter life ever reach out and say i wish you would tweet about smoking pot more or whatever , you know ? but if i don t tweet about games , i hemorrhage followers . it s strange . i ll try , just because i do care about gaming but i mean , give me a break . i just started thyroid meds and my world is kind of shaky and sweaty and nauseous and i m not really feeling most things right now .","113771":"pulp fiction soundtrack was one of the last things i bought on cassette before cds took over , and i played it so many times it broke .","113772":"i really just like all cheeses . i am a fan of cheese . i ve been to the tillamook cheese factory like , times since i ve moved to the portland area . it s sad probably how much i like cheese .","113773":"no","113774":"less than i would like . growing up i read constantly , now i m lucky if i read or books a year ."}}
