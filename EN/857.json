I heard about you for years, but never who you actually were till two years ago. At first I thought you would never even be interested in even. Being friends with me yet alone a relationship because we were total opposites. After seeing what you been through, I just wanted you to get treated the way you deserved to be, after seeing you broken, hurt and devastated over and over again. I decided to aim for the buses and take the risk of getting to know you and spend one on one quality time together. I became the friend who never wanted to leave your side and just wanted to try my hardest to put even a smile on my face, and the more we got closer and the more we became friends I quickly fell for you. I was scared, I wanted to run and I didn't want to get in way to deep insane there was no escape. I had my walls built up and a lock on my heart for everyone to keep out as I have been healing from previous committed relationships myself and heartbroken over and over again as well. I didn't want to trust, but you came in like a bullet and made sure that if I was falling you were going to be there to catch me. We started dating around the end of September and have made so many memories together, ones I'll forever cherish as time passes. And so far you have kept your promise, I fell for you and you were right there to catch me. I wasnt really expecting an engagement anytime soon. But then two days ago you got down on your knees and grabbed my hand, asking if I'll forever be yours. I said yes and here we are today. I'm thankful for you, thankful that a guy so amazing like you came into my life at the most unexpected time. A time when I thought I had everything figured out and I could manage everything on my own. Thank you for being here when I'm feeling down, being a shoulder to cry on and for always cheering me on and supporting me through the good and the bad.   I love you and ian so much and always will.

And its heartbreaking we know, but sisterhood comes first and we will always be sisters. This wasnt a rushed decision and nothing bad happened. She just wanted something different and we are glad she has been with us for the 10 years as she has done so much and impacted everyone in a positive way. No its not because of her husband this is something she has wanted for a long time. And we supoort her choice and will support her through it. However so much will change, and there will be a blank space and a missing puzzle piece. But Dani will still be involved with the cimfam, either randomly appearing in videos or supporting the new music, or cheering us on from the crowds. We didnt force her or kick her out of the band. And the door will always be open for her to come back if she wants. But the band is not leaving, we are going into 2020 as a five piece. Kinda like it was when we first started youtube then added our brother Michael in for a while then Dani joined in. ...
