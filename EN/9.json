I don't want you going anywhere in the house except the living room and kitchen..okay?\n  ","9777":"\n  *Reaper however didn't know that, he actually began panicking and started calling out for Geno* Love..!? LOVE!!\n  ","9778":"\n  *Lol okay*\n  \n  *Reaper sighed* Okay..as long as you don't say anything about this place..you can stay.. and you can only go in the living room and the kitchen, that's it.. the rest of the house is off limits..\n  \n  *he chuckled a bit* So anyway, you actually liked being chased by the Grim Reaper? You have some problems kiddo\n  ","9779":"\n  *Reaper rubbed his eye sockets as he looked around, he noticed the IV hooked to his Soul and noticed the note hanging off the IV, he pulls down the note and reads it* Love.. *he sighed but he was smiling* I better go find my Tsundere..I hope he didn't go exploring the house.. Oh sh-t! Am I on the couch!? *Reaper quickly moves off the couch but why was he freaked out about that? It makes no sense.. why doesn't he want anyone to look around the house? There must be a lot he's kept secret*\n  ","9780":"\n  *They're cute cX*\n  ","9781":"\n  *Reaper blushed a bit before lifting Genos chin up and clinking him on the teeth, aw*\n  \n  I love you\n  ","9782":"\n  I-it's nothing Love, I was just..thinking about something, anyway *Reaper then nuzzled his Tsundere*\n  ","9783":"\n  *Reaper had gone silent, he wasn't sure he should let Geno he didn't fully recover his magic though he might find out later on if Reaper uses his magic anytime soon*\n  \n  ...\n  ","9784":"\n  *Reaper couldn't help but smile from hearing that* Love.. no matter what, as long as you want to stick around..Death will always follow you\n  ","9785":"\n  He says he snuck inside my hood to escape a cat called Chips ..so guess that explains..*Reaper sighed* as long as he keeps this place a secret  I won't need to make sushi\n  ","9786":"\n  *Reaper then gets up so he can pull Geno into a hug* ..Love..\n  ","9787":"\n  I wasn't inside her garden though.. I was just outside of her house ..I'm not allowed inside the garden because of how our magic is the opposite of eachother.. I could destroy her garden on accident just by entering there or her magic will affect me and do damage..we don't know exactly what would happen but none of the Gods want to risk it\n  ","9788":"\n  You mean that cat? I'm guessing that's why you decided to hide in my hood\n  \n  *Reaper just sighed*\n  \n  ..Just don't go telling this everyone..but let's just say the reason I act so crazy sometimes is because..I have some kind of illness.. a few people already found out about it when I tried keeping it secret..so I might as well just say it.. I'm normally like this when it doesn't act up\n  \n  *Reaper chuckled a bit* You sure you don't want me trying to reap you? I thought you were having fun\n  ","9789":"\n  I don't know..*Reaper wasn't happy about hearing any of this either but would Geno be happier if he was at Lifes? He couldn't help but question it now*.. ..\n  \n  ..You wouldn't get to see me, Sorell or Goth anymore but the other kiddos could still see you and everyone else.. reapers aren't allowed in Lifes garden.. but mortals are allowed..and any of the other Gods ..but reapers can't..\n  ","9790":"\n  You..did..!? *Reaper facepalmed* Damn it.. just don't tell anyone about the place we're in.. it's secret, okay?\n  \n  ..And..it doesn't matter how I've been.. how you been..?\n  \n  *is Fish going to be surprised Reaper is oddly nice right now?*\n  ","9791":"\n  ..*Reaper sighed* Love..\n  ","9792":"\n  *Reaper was startled, how did Fish even get there!?

I have a idea what it might of been about but..\n  ","9797":"\n  *Reaper just shakes his skull* How about I remind you then? Before that anon decided to give me poisoned coffee we were spending time together *he wraps a arm around Geno before heading towards that house they were at..Reaper despised the place but he figured it's probably safer to talk inside than outside though he tensed up once they were inside* \"F-ck it.. there's really no other safe place to go..it's either I put up with this place or be out in the open and risk Geno getting hurt again..\" *he thought to himself* We could sit in here and just talk?

At least let me free so I can have a more fair fight..\n  ","10147":"\n  *Reaper was shocked he was suddenly paralyzed..but that doesn't mean you stopped him from attacking, more chains appear and wrap around Cross, this time they were glowing red meaning Reapers Hatred was starting to take over, his Hatred makes his attacks more powerful but the more it takes over..the less control he has over it..*\n  \n  *The chains pin Cross down as a blaster fires at him*\n  ","10148":"\n  *Reaper had used his wings to quickly shield himself from the blast* How about instead of using the kid as your backup, you actually fight me one on one?

YOU LOOK HALF DEAD!!\n  \n  *They then take Geno into another room and even go as far as duct taping bandages to his skull and try sticking him in a full body cast lol*\n  ","10423":"\n  *Shockingly once Geno had brought him back the doctors seemed panicked and right away picked up Reaper and headed off, that was odd, they usually avoid him like the plague, maybe he hasn't told this hospital he was the Grim Reaper yet otherwise they definitely wouldn't be helping him although after they took Reaper, once getting a good look at Geno, they begin to freak out*\n  \n  Dr: OMG HOW ARE YOU ALIVE!? We should of helped you first!! GET THE BANDAGES!! *they begin wrapping Geno in bandages like he's a mummy*\n  ","10424":"\n  *Reaper had left his hospital room the other day when he noticed Geno wasn't there beside him but he really shouldn't have been up and moving around just yet, now he was just laying on the ground outside*\n  \n  ..Ngh...\n  ","10425":"\n  ..Love? *Reaper looks back over at where he heard Genos voice and saw his Tsundere was back beside him and lays his skull on Genos lap*..mngh...\n  ","10426":"\n  *Reaper peers down from his hospital bed but he was pretty disoriented and not very awake*\n  \n  ..Geno..?
