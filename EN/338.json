it s good so far ! ! i got a free coffee from starbucks this morning and work hasn t been too stressful so far so i m hoping the rest of the day goes just as well .","312670":"i suppose that s one way

the best birthday messages i ve ever received , lmao . thank you , mysterious stranger ! ! ?","312672":"no , actually ! ! this one s name is meeko ! ! he s really cute , but he barks a lot , which

misunderstood you . no , i don t think that s internalized homophobia . unfortunately , saying that s gay to mean something bad has become such an instinctive thing for some people that they don t realize the implications of the phrase . however , if you recognize that the phrase is inherently wrong and try to avoid using it , then you re perfectly fine .","312676":"idk if i m understanding you right . . . are you asking if it s homophobic to call yourself gay if you re gay ? ? i m confused .","312677":"lol idk if this was a typo or not , but i m turning tomorrow .","312678":"hazelnut

who work for social security shouldn t have fucking jobs . the mistakes they make when they deny disabled people their benefits is absolutely appalling . i just wrote a page brief about one judge s decision and ripped this guy a new asshole because he didn t follow any procedural rules . i m so angry .","312681":"it s wrong to ask a complete stranger what their weight is , regardless of their gender . it s insensitive .","312682":"that isn t something i want to do . my party days are far behind me , i have no interest in seeing people who don t care about me , getting belligerently drunk , or being surrounded by crowds of strangers .","312683":"i actually forgot that i had it recorded so i was able to catch up last night after you sent me that message ! ! it was definitely interesting , idk how i feel about it yet . this season was a lot different from every other season so i need a day or so to swallow it lol .","312684":"i know he wanted to put security cameras around mosques , but i didn t know he wanted to register muslims . that s fucking ridiculous . if this is true then he s insinuating that every muslim is a suspect . smh","312685":"my best friend your best friend","312686":"personally , no . psychosis is a mental illness that has no correlation with the way a person loves other people . you can have a psychotic disorder and have a healthy romantic relationship , or you can have a psychotic disorder and be involved in unhealthy relationships . i d go out on a limb and suggest that perhaps there are some hormonal imbalances that are indicative of the two , but that doesn t imply causation . it s not something i m familiar with , at any rate .","312687":"i suppose in hypothetical works of art or fiction , it can be beautiful . not the act of shame itself , but perhaps the symbolism behind it . for example , when cersei was shamed in game of thrones , she was stripped naked , insulted by civilians , had things thrown at her , all while the clergy peacefully walked beside her , chanting the word shame . the act , in itself , is grotesque and shameful . watching it makes you feel sick inside . but the symbolism behind why she was being shamed , what it did to her , how it was the one time the audience saw cersei in a vulnerable state of mind i think that was beautiful .","312688":"self awareness . you re aware of what you re doing to yourself , so it prevents you from becoming completely immersed into whatever state of mind you re trying to be in . it s much easier to follow someone else s lead , knowing that they ll be there in case something goes awry that s out of your control .","312689":"i used to do that a lot when i was younger i d do stupid , reckless , and illegal things for the thrill of it , just to see if i could get away with it . and of the time , i did . thankfully lakocis wasn t a cop back then when we were on askfm , or else i d be screwed . ?","312690":"fight me , mothafucka . candy crash is fuckin

worth of meds for me , which is great because now whenever i go on a trip , i don t have to lug my prescription bottles around ! !","312693":"female . for future reference , this isn t a nice question

.","312702":"that s my secret i don t have one .","312703":"mainly my moods , how my medication is working , my symptoms , my symptoms that are chemical versus behavioral , etc . i ve also talked to her about other psychological stuff and my own theories about how i behave the way i do , and she gives me feedback . i also take the phq and beck inventory questionnaire every time i have an appointment with her , so she can track how my moods have been .","312704":"you don t get diagnosed in therapy at least the way my facility is run . i ve never talked to my therapist about any diagnoses before . i mainly talk to her about my past , coming to terms with how it s made me feel , how my past is reflected in my present behavior , trying to do positive self talk , being mindful of yourself , etc .","312705":"what oh my god i fucking love you .","312706":"this is the biggest crock of shit i ve ever heard .","312707":"no ? it s not ok to shame anyone for their choices regarding their own body , regardless of who they are .","312708":"hello , i m trans .","312709":"ok peter griffin . ?","312710":"probably not . there s nothing likeable about me and the majority of the questions i receive are hate mail .","312711":"my coworkers were literally holding doors open for me as i ran into the building because it s pouring outside and i am drenched from head to toe oh my god .","312712":"i need validation and closure regarding my past and how it s affected my present . i need to unlearn bad habits and adopt healthier coping mechanisms and positive self talk

good feminist yourself , you would at least be aware of someone s pronouns . secondly , you obviously have never visited my page before if you think i pander to men lol . i ve been in a committed relationship for years with the same person , i couldn t give two shits about what people thought of me . third , you re giving me shit because i posted a photo of my skyrim character and i said she was attractive . are you shitting me right now ? lmao .","312725":"i really can t tell if you re fucking with me or if you re legitimately serious . i m an intersectional feminist . i talk about feminism of the time on my askfm page . i take active stances against injustice , i donate to charitable causes , and i work with disadvantaged groups . if you seriously , honest to god think that i m some sort of mra antifeminist trash , then holy shit you have no clue who i am , hahah .","312726":"honey , you re on my askfm page . i can t exactly fuck off on my own page . and i wasn t aware that

screenshot and forgot to attach it . i ll post it below . my brain is shot .","312739":"i just placed an order with a merchant online who s just starting out her business selling clothing the best

to the point where i distanced myself from her because it was so emotionally draining just to be friends with her . i started ignoring her calls and texts after a while . she actually called me again last night , and i knew why because she had previously ranted on facebook about what a hard time she s been having with her boyfriend . i m just sick of being people s go to when they re in trouble , meanwhile they couldn t give two shits about me .","312748":"in no particular order , i m just listing based on what s coming up first on my account . saving private ryan . the princess bride .

ableist , makes absolutely zero sense , and further stigmatizes taboo subjects just for that entertainment factor . there are some seasons like asylum and freak show that i absolutely hated .","312756":"no . i think we need a total overhaul of the system , honestly . our current political state is extremely corrupt and the citizens aren t being represented properly .","312757":"you mean

have . this absolutely terrifies me .","312764":"idk anyone who disagrees with trump and is violent . . . it s actually ironic because someone who supported trump was actually one who threatened to do physical harm to me last night , lol .","312765":"those who are uneducated rarely see anything wrong with their statements or actions they place the blame on others . those who are educated know when to apologize for their actions and have a more worldly view of things , and they recognize when they perhaps don t know things . the most ironic thing about the past few days is that while i ve simply been stating my opinion , i ve gotten nothing but backlash and personal attacks from people who disagree with me .","312766":"people have the freedom to protest what they want to protest . i don t see what the big issue is , especially when their protests aren t personally affecting your life .","312767":"what makes you think that trump doesn t . . . ? i never said i supported many of clinton s

one week .","312778":"you re lucky i just got them done last week .","312779":"we have no choice but to give him a chance , unfortunately . that s the scary part there s no going back . the only intelligent thing about him is that he s been able to convince a majority of america that he s going to do great things for this country , preying on their insecurities and inciting them with words of violence . he does a terrific job at portraying an image that he s going to say and do a lot without actually saying or doing anything at all .","312780":"what lmao . how the fuck . . . ?","312781":"i haven t checked my phone in hours , and i logged into troll messages , telling me that i m hypocritical , a liar , authoritarian , and a liberal freak . what lives do you all have to relentlessly

same way as you ? grow the fuck up .","312782":"i am currently living in what you call affordable suburbs . anything less expensive than where i am now would be governmental housing .","312783":"it s sad that there s this stereotype about long islanders that they re all wealthy , because that s the furthest from the truth . there are wealthy people who live in the hamptons and on the north shore ,

we will not stand here and allow our government to do whatever they please when the time comes and i expect it will come soon , we will prove our strength in numbers . we will love each other and

, people will have the finances to actually afford those items . as opposed to now , where prices are so inflated and people aren t properly compensated to afford those items at all .","312790":"exactly this . minimum wage is supposed to be a liveable wage , and people cannot live off of what minimum wage is right now due to the inflation of prices everywhere else .","312791":"i wish i had the privilege to not understand how his policies would affect underprivileged groups . many people will have their rights taken away from them , and many more are already afraid to face the public due to the heightened sense of violence surrounding this nation due to this decision .","312792":"of course low self esteem , lack of validation in their own life , and a sense of entitlement . they likely didn t receive adequate care and attention growing up , so they lash out in one of the few ways they can with no repurcussions .","312793":"people are angry . people protest . they know that their actions won t impeach trump when he enters office , but it gives people a sense of purpose and solidarity when they come together with like minded people to fight for a cause they believe

.","312798":"i think i m going to refrain from using the internet for the next few hours . my heart hurts too much . seeing all of these people suffering from this decision is so painful . there are muslims afraid to leave their houses in hijab . there are trans kids afraid to go to school and face their peers . there are trans adults afraid to present how they want to present in fear of being attacked . people are crying and yelling and protesting , and nobody sees anything wrong with that ? i need to take a step back and reflect . i m losing hope fast and it isn t healthy for me right now

mean","312802":"i highly doubt it . who are the people who end up doing a lot of construction work that isn t part of a union ? oh that s right , illegal immigrants .","312803":"basically in trump s mind . . . muslim isis . which couldn t be further from the truth . he s talked about instituting surveillance on muslim mosques and other places muslim people frequent . there will be stricter policies on muslims entering or exciting the country . he s literally infringing on privacy laws because he doesn t trust islam .","312804":"no , i honestly can t even listen to the guy speak . i ll read what he said when i get home , but i can t listen to him talk because he gets under my skin so badly .","312805":"only time will tell .","312806":"trump actually used to be a lot more liberal in the past than he is now .","312807":"i don t have the time , energy , or mental strength to join a physical protest . i have way too much shit going on in my life . for now , i ll safely protest from the comfort of my own home where i know i won t be attacked .","312808":"go online and do your research on the things trump has said and done in the past . his entire persona is a contradiction . he has never remained consistent in his beliefs , and because of that , it s hard to determine what he actually believes . i was briefly skimming through his wikipedia page earlier today and going through the sources , and the stuff written there makes me sick to my stomach . not to mention the things pence believes as well .","312809":"statistics showed that he could have possibly won against trump in a landslide . however , statistics also estimated that clinton would have won the election and that didn t turn out to be true either .","312810":"if clinton rigged the elections , then

friends , friends . ?","312812":"literally if everyone who had a protest vote gave their vote to clinton , she would have won . instead , they relied on bs third party candidates who have no realistic

to stay married . but who knows .","312814":"i m not being dramatic . i m simply regurgitating the information i ve read online about his beliefs and pence s beliefs . trump has the option to appoint new supreme court justices . i won t be surprised if they overturn marriage equality .","312815":"no , my immediate response was anger . anger and resentment . i m still angry .","312816":"i love you , bee . ? no need for apologies . this will undoubtedly affect everyone , not just the us . i m terrified of the months and years to come with respect to international affairs .","312817":"trump has a remarkable history of saying one thing and then contradicting himself months later . if he was pro lgbt , he wouldn t have taken on pence as a vp . they don t believe in marriage equality or even civil unions .","312818":"i m not saying clinton was a perfect candidate , because she s not . i would have preferred bernie , personally . however , she at least has had experience in politics for most of her life , knows what she is talking about , and is a lot less radical than trump . if you re going to talk about war , then i don t see how you can t think that trump is anti war . he wants more nuclear weaponry . he believes that torture methods like waterboarding should be more severe . and he doesn t even respect veterans .","312819":"as a fellow new yorker , i can affirm that the majority of new yorkers especially in the metro areas hate his guts and everything he stands for . i m happy that new york is a blue state .","312820":"hello , i m also biologically female , part of the lgbt community , and mentally ill .","312821":"i didn t say he wanted to deport all mexicans and muslims , lol . i clearly said illegal immigrants .","312822":"i support hard working people who have built the foundations of this country . trump s idea of a mass deportation of illegal mexican immigrants and muslims is going to cause our society to plummet both economically and socially . there will be riots .","312823":"the presidency is based on the electoral college votes . the first one to obtain electoral votes wins overall .","312824":"once trump deports all of the illegal immigrants and makes it impossible for them to apply for citizenship or a work visa , watch how fast this economy will crumble .","312825":"potentially , yes .","312826":"senate , house of representatives , and the presidency . and eventually the supreme court , as well , once trump elects his judges .","312827":"no doubt , by a landslide .","312828":"unfortunately , that s how america s democracy works clinton won the popular vote , but trump won the electoral college vote . in addition , all three branches of government are now republican so the whole checks and balances deal doesn t seem too convincing anymore , lol .","312829":"trump and pence are against literally everything that i stand for . my life , and the lives of my friends and loved ones , will be in danger because they do not fit the mold of trump s perfect citizen . i voted for clinton , although i do not like her , because she was the only way this country wouldn t succumb to a trump presidency . well now look at us .","312830":"anon you have no right to speak , you didn t vote ! me hello , i did vote anon lol stop bragging about voting get fucked seriously ? this country is screwed .","312831":"have you not been on my page in the last two days ? i voted yesterday morning , lmao .","312832":"not outright , but i wouldn t be surprised . https thinkprogress . org trump pence transgender students aa ee cdb . l vzmne","312833":"i don t think so . not unless the votes have been miraculously counted wrong , or something to that effect . idk i ve never heard of or happening , if that can even happen at all .","312834":"like , electroshock therapy and borderline torture and brainwash gay kids into being straight .","312835":"no , he doesn t enter office until january , .","312836":"think of it this way if trump gets assassinated , who will take over his position ? pence . is that really the person you want following in trump s footsteps ?","312837":"oh my god . guys , obama is still the president right now . he will be until january , . trump won t take office until next year .","312838":"i m terrified for my country . for the women , people of color , disabled , mentally ill , muslims , and the lgbt community . so many of our rights are going to be taken away . and with all three branches of government being republican now , only time will tell what will happen . i m honestly scared and this is worsening my mental health so much .","312839":"realistically , both . he s a supporter of increased border security and increased measures for people to obtain citizenship , which isn t necessarily bad on paper . but the context in which he applies those methods of thinking is rooted in xenophobia . he has made false assumptions about immigrants and has showed blatant display of racism , which shouldn t be ignored . for a person in a position of leadership to have and advocate for those views , that only encourages the people beneath him to think and act the same way .","312840":"if trump is assassinated , that means pence will have more power because he s the vp . and , if anything , pence is a lot more horrifying of an individual than trump is .","312841":"i don t think there s one simple cause . . . it s likely everything combined . people simply want to point fingers instead of realizing what their candidate has done . most of trump s supporters that i ve spoken to literally have nothing else to say except she s a war criminal and used a private email server . even though its been investigated a million times . there are people on my fb who now don t trust the fbi because of the whole stupid email thing , meanwhile . . . they trust trump ? a person who has openly insulted women , mocked a disabled person , wants to convert gay kids into being straight , thinks abortions are evil , doesn t have a lick of political experience , wants more guns in america , and believes people should have more nuclear weapons ? people are blind to the horrors that will unfold . perhaps they re retaliating against having a black president , or they don t like clinton because she s a woman , or another reason entirely . i have no clue . all i know is that we re fucked .","312842":"that s what i ve been saying all along . protest votes do literally nothing to help the current state of affairs . while people were voting third party to save their own morality , others were voting democratic because they knew that people s lives will be on the line .","312843":"i just woke up thinking last night was just a bad dream , and then felt my chest crash and plummet after realizing that it was , indeed , real . my heart hurts .","312844":"new york voted for clinton .","312845":"all three branches of the government are now republican , so things look pretty bleak .","312846":"the fact that you and people like you believe that this fear is just a running joke i hope you enjoy that privilege while it lasts . people are literally going to be fearing for their life under a trump presidency because their basic human rights will be stolen .","312847":"exactly ! ! it isn t just the us that s affected , everyone is affected . and when you have the majority of other countries swaying a certain way and sharing their fear with american citizens , then a mistake has been made . idk what government entity thinks it s a great idea to literally promote racism , sexism , misogyny , homophobia , and transphobia , but it s all fucking bullshit and this country is a damn fucking joke .","312848":"america has to realize that they have a genuine problem on their hands when most of its citizens are literally terrified of a person becoming president . this isn t normal . this isn t what a democracy is supposed to be .","312849":"trump clinton although i keep seeing different stats . either way , trump is in the lead .","312850":"i just found out i m screaming this isn t the end though , so keep your fingers crossed ! !","312851":"trust me , this has nothing to do with you and to do with the current election crisis . i need to calm my nerves , hahah .","312852":"it s ok ! ! i have twitter notifications being sent to my phone in real time so i keep getting texted all of the updated statistics .","312853":"according to shaun king , the current votes are trump clinton there s still a lot of states left to be counted , though .","312854":"right now i m debating on what s going to hurt worse in the morning an inevitable hangover or election heartache .","312855":"clinton just took virginia , and i m hoping that she ll take california too it s largely a liberal state . there s still hope .","312856":"ily too friend . i m so broken and disheartened by all of this right now . fuck this , dude .","312857":"my anxiety is literally through the roof right now . does anyone realize what a trump presidency could mean for the future of this country . does nobody give a shit about human rights .","312858":"trump is currently leading in the popular vote and electoral college , and i m not gonna lie , i m starting to worry .","312859":"so i have this one coworker who has been calling my interoffice phone the last two days , talking about the election and trump and clinton . which would be fine if she wasn t shoving her trump vote down my throat every fucking time . i did all of my research this weekend , trump seems to line up best with my beliefs and clinton is a liar . i can t trust her or the fbi . what the fuck is wrong with you . after the conversation ended , i accidentally slammed my phone down and my cubicle buddy next to me was looking at me like , o o . . . are you okay . . . ? ? no , i m not oh fucking kay cue mcr memes . how in the hell can you justify that slimy cheesepuff to me when i ve repeatedly told you that i did not like him . don t fucking call me and tell me you and your whole family voted for him . the sole reason why i voted this morning was to invalidate your damn vote karyn .","312860":"idk i m not that worried actually . maybe i m just in denial though lol .","312861":"people who can t normally vote on election day can either vote with the board of elections or submit an absentee ballot .","312862":"i see someone is applying their sat words to real life situations .","312863":"? ? ?","312864":"idk . i know it s illegal to take a picture of your ballot , your vote could potentially be cast out if they find out who you are .","312865":"i ve always been a big fan of the app up until recently the fact that the newest update shuffles images and doesn t list them in chronological order really bothers me , i end up missing a lot of people s posts .","312866":"today s the only day to vote for most people , unless they re disabled or otherwise couldn t have voted today at all . polling places in the us are only open today , my polling place is actually open from am pm surprisingly .","312867":"i am , i m actually debating on leaving my house early this morning it s am and i don t have to be at work until am or waiting until i m done with work and therapy around pm . i think i may just leave early and get it over with so i don t have to worry about it for the rest of the day lol .","312868":"there s literally no such thing , but all right then .","312869":"supernatural , parks and rec , criminal minds .

at work . but if anon is trying to prove a point , they re doing a shit job at it lol .","312873":"if he was bothered by me tagging him in that answer , he would have told me and i would have taken it down . while i m sure he appreciates the sentiment , i don t think liam needs anyone looking out for him lol . cc lakocis","312874":"i apologize that you ve had bad experiences with feminism . i actually know a lot of men who support feminism and have helped spread education and awareness of the movement , though . it isn t all bad .","312875":"intersectional feminism doesn t focus solely on women , actually it focuses on oppressed groups as a whole , trans individuals , and the negative impact society has on men and the unrealistic expectations placed on men that have arose out of the oppression of women .","312876":"yet here i am , alive and thriving .","312877":"so i just went through my inbox and deleted at least trolls attempts at questions from today and last night alone . so

incite drama between askfm members , sxxually based questions , pvrn , and anything else that isn t a question ! ! it will be deleted ! ! ?","312878":"the mocking tone of this message is simply aggravating and only reaffirms my belief that women aren t taken seriously in a gaming context . women consist of or more , according to some studies of all those who play video games , although most wouldn t necessarily consider themselves to be gamers .","312879":"they re all bs , in my honest opinion . think of it this way a student body is composed of dozens of student who learn concepts and ideas in a variety of different ways . some people learn hands on , other people prefer lectures , and some need a mixture of the two . no two people learn the same way . and because of this , there s no way to adequately test a person s intelligence on an objective scale especially when the same test is given to the same dozens of students . just because a student gets a bad grade on a written exam doesn t mean they re a bad student . they could actually be incredibly intelligent just not in the way that standard public schools see what intelligence is . these days , most schools solely teach for the rest and this leaves behind dozens of students who require more hands on lessons . not because they re stupid , but because they simply grasp ideas using different criteria . so imo , standardized tests like the sat are a poor evaluation of a student s potential . it s a shame so much emphasis is placed on it .","312880":"i know , right ? depressed writer , isolated themself from others , used to drown their sorrows in alcohol , and flees from real life problems by escaping into the arts . i m a walking shakespearian tragedy .","312881":"i just got home from work and i m so excited to make a cup of tea and play skyrim .","312882":"i welcome them with open arms .","312883":"ohh , ok . i just looked it up , seems like it applies more to multiplayer fps games like call of duty and battlefield ? i don t play games like that so it doesn t really apply to me lol . if anything , when i do quests with friends in games like destiny which is the only game i m comfortable playing multiplayer , i m the idiot wandering around and making sure all of the collectibles are collected , hahahah .","312884":"this statement reminds me of this post i reblogged on fb the other day , because it s me .","312885":"idk what taking the piss means , but i personally liked it a lot better than new vegas . idk why people get so angry when others are happy with the way a game is designed . who cares . the purpose of gaming is to have fun .","312886":"definitely skyrim , for sure . in my opinion , it s one of the most visually pleasing video games that i ve ever personally played . allegedly no man s sky is also an aesthetically pleasing game , but i ve never played it myself .","312887":"that moment when you almost accidentally send your nudes to the group chat instead of to the person whom it was intended .","312888":"it s a game that you have to buy it s made by bethesda softworks , a very big gaming company . you can play it on either the xbox , playstation , or the pc . it s honestly my all time favorite game , i ve spent months exploring the wilderness and doing quests and just getting lost in the stories . it s basically a fantasy open world rpg game , you can choose the type of fighter you are magic , two handed , one handed , archery , etc and the plot is pretty intricate depending on the choices you make . i d suggest to google it because anything i describe won t suffice lol .","312889":"do i look like the expert on the history of the fallout universe ? lmao . i liked what they stood for and their storyline was interesting . i grew attached to the characters .","312890":"lol i did a lot of stupid shit as a teenager that i d never touch these days particularly , drugs and a lot of the reckless behavior i took part in when i was younger .","312891":"sometimes , yeah . i actually tried these really good kettle chips the other day , they were baked with avocado oil and then had some sort of lime ranch flavoring on top of them . they were really good .","312892":"considering it seems as if it s been studied somewhat by historians and there s quite a few articles about it online , it seems as if it s a legitimate thing . to be quite frank , this is a concept i m not very familiar with , though , so i can t say much on the topic .","312893":"this is the most counter productive message i ve ever seen , lmao . the reason why there s so much disparity between white people and poc is because of racial segregation . you can t solve racial problems by dividing people due to their race , that will only worsen relations and reaffirm the antiquated thought process of racism in people s minds . if you want to help the blm movement , then focus on the idea that black people are treated differently because of their race and confront it head on . don t fucking cast it aside because that s how we got to this shitty point in society to begin with .","312894":"uh . . . i don t really know what you mean ? depends on the movie , i suppose . sometimes it needs to be historically accurate , even if that means settling for racist or sexist standards because that s how life was life back in the day . for example , in the mafia iii game , they had a preface that stated , please be advised that the racial segregation and slurs used in this game are a reflection of its time and not a belief of the creators of the game , it s meant to be historically accurate blah blah blah . but if the character they re talking about is meant to be a certain ethnicity and they chose a white person for that role anyway , then yeah i see a problem with that . there s no reason why they couldn t choose a just as competent actor of the same race .","312895":"the chilly , cold weather . snowfall and how everything appears clearer outside after its snowed . cozy nights by the heater , covered in blankets , and drinking hot cocoa . white peppermint mocha lattes . seeing the looks on people s faces when they open a gift i ve given them . holiday pay ! ! tax season .","312896":"i wouldn t necessarily say it s ableist , but it s pretty counterproductive . . . i know it s supposed to help raise awareness for sh and promote understanding , but the only thing people do is draw a stupid semicolon on their wrists without even talking about it , and then claiming that they re a good person by contributing to the cause . it s more of a trend than anything at this point , which makes somewhat of a mockery out of sh . if you really wanna help people who suffer from sh and mental illness , then promote funding for mental health research , destigmatize illnesses using words and research , and correct your friends and family if they say something insensitive or ableist . the meaning behind the semicolon project is good , but i feel like a lot of people go about it the wrong way or do so to make themselves feel better instead of to actually help others .","312897":"australia ! ! i ve always wanted to go there for mostly aesthetic reasons it looks pretty but now i have a friend who lives there and i d love to visit them .","312898":"probably because he knows that its clinton vs trump , and clinton is clearly the only logical option we have . also if the senate has a more liberal turnout due to a democratic nomination , bernie can actually be part of it and establish influence himself .","312899":"buckling under the pressure of others . . . ? it s not as if voting third party or writing in someone else means that you re trying to go against the grain most of the time , it s because that person doesn t like the republican or democratic candidate like in this instance . however , a third party has never won the presidential election mostly due to the electoral college which is out of the hands of the public , nor has a write in . if the goal is to keep trump out of office , then doing either of the above isn t helping anyone unfortunately .","312900":"aw cool i m pretty easy going . . . perhaps stuff pertaining to video games , mental illness , and or cosmetics ?","312901":"this is insinuating that those who are mentally ill are inherently violent and cannot be trusted with weapons stop it with that mindset , it s statistically wrong and unsettling .","312902":"i usually don t use my phone at all while i m driving using your phone while driving is actually a crime in new york , whether it s talking on the phone or obviously texting . i ve talked on the phone before , but i usually place the phone on my dashboard and put it on speaker so i still have both hands on the wheel . and if i need to do something like change a song , i ll do it when i m sitting at a red light . the risks involved are way too great for me to do something like text while driving , especially if it can wait until i m home . my mother always gets angry with me because she tends to text me while i m on the road , asking me to run an errand for her . obviously i don t get it until i m already home , and she hits me with , well maybe you should look at your phone ! uh no thanks , i d rather not get into a horrific car accident smh .","312903":"this is going to sound silly considering i m turning in less than two weeks but today , i stepped out of my comfort zone by going to a local deli and ordering cold cuts for my family . for someone like me , this is weird and uncharacteristic of me . i usually have terrible social anxiety to the point where i m terrified of talking to cashiers , ordering food , asking for help , etc . i m even afraid to answer the door for the pizza guy , at times . but lately my anxiety , in general , has been a lot better and i ve actually run a lot of errands over the past few weeks with no issues at all ! ! it s a huge load off of my shoulders tbh .","312904":"i know you have good intentions for sending this to me to aid in the conversation , but please try to refrain from sending me this sort of thing . this is obviously a really personal topic to me and sometimes i m not comfortable talking about it .","312905":"if someone is in my inbox saying they re threatening od , then i m going to believe them . i wish i was fortunate enough to wrongly assume that svicide attempts were uncommon .","312906":"please go to a hospital . and if this is a joke i swear to fucking god i ll deactivate because i don t need people mocking svicide on my page

becomes a mother , they can t have fun anymore in a responsible manner .","312923":"it s literally the same as taking a gel pen to your upper eyelid and hoping for the best . i ve had some good trials

this earth .","312925":"not necessarily . they have the same meaning attached to them , it s just a matter of personal preference . one word doesn t have any precedence over the other with respect to maturity .","312926":"shout out to colourpop for making my eyes look sick as hell . ?","312927":"according to historians , sociology professors , civil rights activists , etc . if you don t believe me , then that s fine . no use in trying to argue with me about it though when i m steadfast in my reliance upon these conclusions . i m honestly getting a bit tired of being personally attacked due to this issue , so if you don t have anything productive to add to this conversation , i think we can simply agree to disagree .","312928":"racist , no . discriminatory , obviously . racism is a system of oppression , and white people have benefitted from it for hundreds of years . the concept of the word racism is a reflection of that oppression , so while a bunch of people saying that white people are genetically inferior is obviously wrong , it isn t by definition racist .","312929":"likely because i keep on attempting to explain a very simple fact to you , and you re either refusing to believe it or you re just trolling me , lol . i can only say the same thing in so many different ways to try to have you understand what i m discussing .","312930":"i never said that people of color couldn t be racist towards other people of color . again . . . putting words into my mouth . as for white people , obviously we can t experience racism but we can certainly be discriminated against due to our race . discrimination and racism are two different things , though .","312931":"i never said anything about people dying at the hands of police , so i don t know what sort of misinformation i m allegedly spreading . i m literally stating that racism is alive and well in the us , and those who are white don t have to worry about a lot of the same things people of color have to worry about on a regular basis .","312932":"why did i even answer the first question smh .","312933":"i never said that a white person is automatically an oppressor solely due to being white , so i would appreciate it if you could stop putting words into my mouth . looking at the state of the world right now , it would be naive to say that those who are white experience the same racial indifferences as what people of color face on a daily basis solely due to their race . for example , i got pulled over by a cop a few months ago for speeding and i wasn t afraid . with what s been happening in the world lately , could i have felt the same if i was a person of color ?","312934":"that s the difference between dictionary definitions and sociological definitions , though . the meanings of words change as society progresses . what s written in a dictionary is static , and dictionary definitions don t take into consideration the societal implications of the words . theoretically , racial privilege can be removed if we fight to make people aware of it and , in turn , take steps to dismantle it . unfortunately , i don t see trust happening anytime soon , though .","312935":"privilege is multifaceted , so this isn t really one of those yes or no answers . people who are white are privileged due to their race , because people of color have been oppressed by those who are white over the course of the centuries . people of color are still oppressed due to their race , unfortunately . however , obviously a person s race isn t the only aspect of who they are . . . you can experience oppression if you re gay , or trans , or of a certain ethnicity , or of a certain religion , or of a certain economic class , if you re mentally ill , if you re physically disabled , etc . you can simultaneously benefit from racial privilege while experiencing oppression and discrimination due to something else about who you are . as for bias , bias is taught . anyone can be biased against anyone else if that s how they were raised and they aren t given an opportunity , or want to take an opportunity , to unlearn that bias .","312936":"why do you keep insisting my name is jess .","312937":"the amount of ignorance i receive in my inbox literally confounds me .","312938":"idk how to really answer this qhestion without repeating myself or stating the obvious . transgender people are more likely to be victims of abvse , assault , violence , etc etc . simply because they re transgender , because unfortunately transgender people aren t yet accepted in society and are looked upon as less than human , as wrong or vile , as sinful , as immature or foolish , as attention seeking , and the list goes on . we re not accepted in society for who we are , which places most transgender people in vulnerable positions .","312939":"i m really fucking sick and tired of transgender people being made to look like fools because of those who won t take the time to properly educate themselves on the scientific prospects of sex and gender . the average lifespan of a transgender person is years old . transgender people have an alarmingly higher rate of svicide compared to cisgender people . nearly of transgender people report experiencing discrimination in the world place . transgender people are more susceptible to being the victim of police violence and anti lgbt homicide . the sad part is i could rattle off every statistic on the planet about transgender people , and you re still going to walk away from this conversation thinking that transgender people aren t human beings .","312940":"fuck no . i am not equipped to handle children .","312941":"it was all right . my house key broke this morning while trying to lock my front door . so that upset me right from the beginning . work itself was generally boring . however , there s a lawyer that i work with i m technically considered his assistant since he travels and i m his go to person if he needs things from the office or has instructions for development and he s been totally unresponsive for the past week despite me emailing him and calling him regarding his cases . it s gotten to the point where some supervisors are involved because we can t develop cases properly because he isn t answering my questions . i went to dunkin donuts on lunch and was excited for an iced tea but they fucked it up and it tasted like liquor without the burn of alcohol . i ve been feeling really empty the entire rest of the day . i canceled plans with my best friend because i wasn t up to it , even though she went wedding dress shopping and wanted to show me stuff . idk my moods have been all over the place and its so exhausting . now i m playing skyrim and i m probably going to watch the new episode of ahs soon .","312942":"spending a year of my life not knowing every night whether someone close to me was alive or dead , living every moment in fear of losing them and developing extremely unhealthy coping mechanisms to handle those emotions . enduring abvse as a child and not realizing the severity of what it actually was until i was much older , because i always assumed that was the normal way kids grew up . subsequently feeling ostracized from my peers because i had nobody i could relate to or trust . and , thereafter , coping with the fact that its affected literally every aspect of who i am to the point where its fractured my very concept of myself . surviving svicide and living with the long term psychological and physical repurcussions that follow me to this very day chronically wishing i was dead . i always survived because it was my instinct to survive , i was constantly in a state of fight or flight and i knew that if i stopped moving , then i would turn into something worse than death . now that i m older and understanding how severely these things affected me , i m taking the steps i need to receive professional help and try to develop healthy coping skills .","312943":"so i just caught up with last week s episode of ahs and holy fucking shit , the carnage is incredible .","312944":"i have unintentionally accumulated an extensive collection of coffee mugs because i always buy one whenever i go somewhere new or interesting .","312945":"ok ignore the fact that i was obviously crying but my eyes look so pretty and it makes me hap","312946":"sorry , i didn t realize that women spent their hard earned money on clothing and jewelry and makeup just to impress their partners , when of the time , their partners won t be able to tell the difference between matte or satin lipstick and wedges versus heels . let people dress how they want to dress . if their partner feels threatened when they wear sexy clothing then that says a lot about their trust in their relationship .","312947":"a concept flirting that is harmless and done for fun rather than in an effort to actually get somewhere with that person . i don t particularly agree with whatever analogy you posted up there because that makes it seem as if flirting is teasing , but i do believe that its ok to flirt occasionally as long as you re open with your partner about the exchanges . it s harmless .","312948":"why wouldn t i ? people should have the freedom to express their religion as long as it doesn t hurt anyone . hijabs don t hurt anyone .","312949":"you re an idiot who clearly can t read because morgan never said that . stop sending around people s links to create falsified drama . it s unfitting .","312950":"i d probably ignore him , like i do with

of really fucking stupid decisions . ?","312952":"no , i can exist without it . it s just convenient for when i m bored however , i am happy with the friends i have made here and , if i ever

credit for lol .","312955":"it s honestly not a huge deal because thankfully my mom was home , but if i was alone , i would have been pissed because that basically means i couldn t have gone to work to watch an unprotected house lol . i had to use pliers to take the broken bits out of the lock lmao .","312956":"my life is a fucking joke lol","312957":"you re right , this is a dumb question

female , deserve to be treated right in a relationship setting . in this respect , people do not necessarily have to do something to warrant that because we should naturally treat other human beings with respect , by default . it isn t too far fetched to say that everyone deserves a partner who loves them wholeheartedly and supports them . if you respect yourself then you won t feel obligated to settle for a person who obviously doesn t respect you in return . as for the whole you never hear guys telling other guys that they deserve a good girlfriend i m calling bull on that hahaha , maybe it s simply because the men in my life are all open minded people , but it isn t uncommon to hear them say that their friend deserves a girlfriend better than x because she treats him like shit , etc etc

are not automatically healthy if you have a vegetarian diet or choose a vegan lifestyle . you can be vegan vegetarian but still partake in unhealthy eating habits , which means that those who are non meat eaters are not automatically healthier than their meat eating counterparts ! ! if you are vegetarian vegan and you take the proper steps to ensure that you re getting all of your supplements then yes , that s healthy . however , that being said , obviously not everyone has that opportunity or access to healthy vegan vegetarian food choices , which can be extremely restricting to some people , causing them to actually be unhealthier than if they chose a meat inclusive diet . not everyone can be vegan or vegetarian , for a plethora of reasons medical illnesses , allergies , mental illnesses such as eating disorders , socioeconomic reasons lack of access or lack of funds to healthy vegan or vegetarian options , etc . in the same vein , it s important to realize that people can simultaneously advocate for animal rights while eating meat because not everyone s bodies are suited for that sort of restrictive diet and we can do this by buying cruelty free products , recycling , and other environmental friendly actions . end rant","312968":"i have friends who are have been in polyamorous relationships , and i support them . as long as everyone in the partnership is happy ,

illnesses can absolutely be disabling . being disabled means that your medical impairments hinder you from being able to hold a regular job , or if you can hold a regular job , you ll need accommodations . for as many physical disabilities i handle on a daily basis , there are just as many people with mental disabilities and obviously often a combination of the two because debilitating depression often occurs secondary to chronic illnesses . as for when people ask what disability does x have ? or thinks that mental illnesses are fun or interesting , those are obviously really

that s so wrong of her to say . when we have depression or anxiety or more complex disorders that don t necessarily correlate with trauma , that doesn t mean that it isn t as difficult for some people to regulate their moods . and obviously if you re in counseling to begin with , you re already looking to get help with that . and who s to say that you arent already trying to make that choice ? she shouldn t have said that at all , that s extremely discouraging . i m sorry that happened to you .","313032":"idk anything about her perspectives , but from the little i ve read online , she seems to

catered to performing jobs in positions of power . i m not saying throw the men out of office that s illogical , ridiculous , and counterproductive . however , society needs to change the fact that women are pressured from a young age to portray a certain image and engage in gender based roles , to think about themselves in terms of their sex as opposed to their passions and skills . there would

drinks are delicious .","313115":"i support the notion of blm . i see no contradiction here .","313116":"i m talking about people who advocate for blm as a whole a lot of rhetoric i see online is all fuck the police sort of stuff . and yeah while you have every right to hate the police if you have a personal vendetta against them due to horrible experiences , i don t really think it s rational to blame the entire group of them as a whole . it s more so the institution of law enforcement , aka the government , then the idea of the police in general if that makes sense . i don t blame black people at all for being upset lol that s why i support blm in general and recognize that a lot of social media advocates seem to go a little off base when it comes to their advocating .","313117":"mob mentality is pretty much psychological conditioning of following the crowd if a lot of people think a particular way , then you re more apt to think the same way as well . if misinformation is spread , then that s a lot of people who are preaching about the wrong thing or portraying a situation in a false light .","313118":"allow me to elaborate then . by crying wolf , i mean that there s a lot of emphasize online placed on misinformation the idea of cherry picking evidence to suit a particular bias and simultaneously ignoring other evidence that may go against what they believe . a lot of situations that i ve seen recently have been in support of justice brought to people to whom justice was brought while ignoring other stories that didn t get the attention they deserved . the idea of hating all law enforcement is , in my opinion , radical because the large majority of law enforcement do their job that they re supposed to do . unfortunately , there will always be bad seeds mixed in , and what needs to be emphasized should be the proper punishments placed on those cops who fuck up instead of giving them paid leave and the whole yards . i feel like a lot of blm these days is about hating law enforcement as a whole , rather than fighting to bring justice to those who have been wrongly killed or acquitted .","313119":"good in theory , terrible in practice . the movement started off strong with a sound emphasis placed on bringing justice to those who have been wrongfully killed by law enforcement who did not receive the proper repurcussions . but due to things like mob mentality , people have seemed to lost touch with the initial reason for the movement itself and has basically cried wolf .","313120":"the grammar in this question makes me cringe .","313121":"yeah my

personally speaking who has ever enforced their religious beliefs onto anyone else . logically speaking , islam has such a terrible reputation in the world today , so why would a person try to promote that , knowing that they may be viewed poorly as a result ? it s ironic think about how many times the catholic church has inappropriately pushed their religious agenda on the general public , meanwhile nobody bats an eye .","313132":"my best friend she s one of the strongest people i know , she puts the needs of others before herself , and she s worked from the bottom up to where she is today . she s one of the most humble people i know , and i respect her so much simply due to her personality , her work ethic , and who she is overall as a person . like she just came straight from work to bring me ginger tea bags . we were supposed to hang out tonight but i canceled on her because of my withdrawal symptoms , so she swung by and dropped off ginger tea to help my nausea . i feel so grateful .","313133":"so basically my timeline was like this pristiq mg to start , then i was bumped up to mg . . . i was on that for a few months and it wasn t doing it , so she told me to go back to the mg and to supplement that with seroquel mg . i took the seroquel for days and it made me feel like shit , so i stopped taking it . then when i saw my pdoc again , she told me to stop taking the pristiq and started me on prozac . i ve been on that mg day for the past days and tomorrow i ll start with mg . but the two days in between where i wasn t taking the pristiq fucked me royally . i hate myself so much lmao . i woke up this morning and i was happy because my head felt clearer , but my vertigo is slowly coming back and i just vomited from nausea and yeah . i m so exhausted and angry

mine are unpopular .","313136":"i like the fact that feminism is multifaceted , so regardless of how much you think you know about a subject , there will always be another perspective from which to consider the topic and it promotes personal growth and education . i try to use feminism to educate others , but i acknowledge that feminism has been given a terrible name due to the radical ideas of third wave feminism . so people unfortunately don t take me seriously if i approach them as a feminist or throw the word feminism into my explanations .","313137":"any sort of moldy yellow , goldish

had to write a brief in support of a client who i found out , halfway through the assignment , was a child mxlestor and was imprisoned for only years due to his actions . and i was sitting there helping him obtain disability benefits , because that s my job and probably couldn t have asked for the brief to be reassigned because of how uncomfortable it made me . i don t want to fucking help

was just released from prison for sxxually abxsing children . ugh .","313146":"this is the biggest pile of bullshit ever . people s cards aren t dealt with any sort of preconceived thought with respect to what we can and cannot mentally handle . what happens to us is completely randomized , people are given a shitty deck of cards to deal with , and the only thing we can do is attempt to sort

to talk to someone like a coworker and attempt to develop a friendship with them , it basically backfires in my face . me having pre existing friends before my mental health took a turn for the worst

that may be your opinion with respect to your own potential relationships or marriages , it isn t your place to pass judgement on other people who are clearly happy with their lives .","313158":"i

models , etc .","313163":"the term crazy has been used to demonize the mentally ill for decades portraying those with mental illnesses as generally bad people who are violent , manipulative , selfish , etc . it reinforces the erroneous stereotype that people with mental disorders are somehow responsible for their disorders , are less human than those who are neurotypical , or aren t worthy of the same rights . just don t use it . there s a million adjectives you could use to describe a person or an event , why settle on a word that has been utilized to continuously hurt people ?","313164":"sex

parents house despise the fact that i have a toxic relationship with them . considering this is doing more damage to me than good , i don t understand how that would constitute as selfish . my options at the present moment are to continue living with a roof over my head but be subjected to toxic relations , or be homeless . this isn t a selfish decision .","313172":"being fascinated by a topic

we ve survived going from paycheck to paycheck . everything that i currently own is something that i ve worked hard to obtain .","313174":"these aren t necessarily unpopular but they need to be said you are not under any obligation to tell your story or explain your scars . you do not owe the world anything for the experiences you ve survived . your story and your body are not forums of discussion for others to pluck like a field of weeds . just because you have revealed a small portion of yourself does not mean you are under any obligation to confess the rest of your story . fuck anyone who says otherwise . you are under no contract to remain in contact with family who has not treated you the way you are supposed to be treated . releasing yourself from toxicity is part of the healing process , and anyone who attempts to guilt you into staying is part of the problem and not worth your time . it is ok to detach yourself from toxic family members and you are not obligated to remain civil simply because of blood ties .","313175":"i don t generally have a go to order , it depends on what i m in the mood to have . starbucks either a green tea latte w soy milk , flat white ,

.","313177":"unfortunately , the topic of rxpe is severely misunderstood in society so i agree with the general idea that you re talking about . sxxual assault against men isn t taken seriously in our society due to the false assumption that men , in general , always want sex thereby making it harder for law officials and healthcare providers to believe in assault victims who are men

totally wrong and intolerant lol .","313186":"depends on how much you re willing to dish out .","313187":"i don t think support is the right term here . in comparing trump to clinton , she s the lesser of two evils . she has a plethora of experience in politics , she s respectful and calculated in her mannerisms , and she knows when and when not to provide her opinion . the same can t be said about trump . yes , they both have horrible skeletons in their closet , but when it comes down to thinking about the future of this country and what risks and decisions will have to be taken the idea of a trump guided system will undoubtedly be poorly executed , impulsive , and premature . he will prompt a nuclear arms race . he will not be willing to diffuse a situation when it needs to be diffused . i m literally scared for the future of this country under a trump dictatorship because democracy won t exist anymore . so no . . . people don t necessarily support clinton in the way you probably assume , they simply recognize the better of two shitty options .","313188":"i struggle with the same irrational fear literally if someone laughs around me , i assume they re making fun of me . i overthink people s statements and conclude that they either feel sorry for me or they re faking their concern towards me in an attempt to ridicule me . if i get up and walk down the hall , i assume people are staring at me . and if people are even looking in my direction , i assume something is wrong with my face or my clothing and it makes me self conscious . it isn t necessarily a normal thing to feel , but it is extremely common it s a side effect of low self esteem and probably anxiety , because this is a big problem of mine when it comes to my social anxiety . i ve been going to therapy to help myself understand these fears and overcome them . if you can do so , i would suggest the same to you . cbt is designed to help people acknowledge these unhealthy thought patterns , recognize the root of the problem , and work towards developing healthier ways of thinking . by working with a therapist you get along with and feel comfortable around , you ll learn to dismantle your negative thought patterns and promote a sense of well being .","313189":"rofl it s honestly fine , i m really happy that i m at least able to help you ! !","313190":"idk on the one hand we should be open minded obviously , yes , and realize that people who are racist and sexist and all of those lovely things are that way because that s how they were raised . however that doesn t mean that we re supposed to sit back and allow them to spew their problematic thoughts all over the place especially if those people are in positions of power and authority . everyone will obviously have their own opinions regardless of what people say , yeah . but idk i wouldn t consider it to be open minded if we just let those people have their way because that s so detrimental to society in so many ways .","313191":"look at the last photo i just posted and the fact that there are more stuffed animals on the bed than there is room for people to sleep on the bed .","313192":"this giant hound

the classroom for any reason other than your own enjoyment of the subject you can leave when you want , especially if you feel unsafe , and just inform the professor later on that the conversation was affecting you in that way . i understand your fear , i was kinda the same way before i entered college too . but you re going to be ok .","313195":"i got your second message ! ! you asked if you were being dramatic no , not at all . trump is honestly a disgusting individual , his perspectives on mental illness and women and race are deplorable and for someone with that mentality to be placed in such a high position of power is honestly terrifying . all of the progress we ve made in the last years would be gone . while disadvantaged and marginalized groups still don t have equal rights , they do have some rights , and under trump , it s likely that all of this progress would be undermined and we d end up going backwards not forwards . at this point it isn t just politics and it isn t just having an opinion , because for someone to defend trump for what he s done and said proves that they re part of the problem . being racist or sexist or ableist isn t an opinion , it s a personality flaw and something like that dictates how you carry yourself or live your life . so no , you re not being dramatic . you re being rational , tbh . it s normal to have such a strong reaction to these things because he isn t just one person , this is reflected in a large part of the public s eyes .","313196":"tbh i would feel weird writing stereotypes about my mental illnesses because right now , i m only diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder . while there is stigma attached to those disorders , there s a hell of a lot more attached to other mood disorders ,

full story , but from my understanding , he posted a series of videos online which included his refusal to use proper pronouns for transgender individuals . like i said , i don t know the full story , but i think that perspective alone is extremely bigoted . someone else s gender has no impact on your daily life , so it makes no sense for a person to actively advocate against and refuse to use someone s pronouns even when asked . to you , their gender may mean nothing but obviously to that person , their gender is their sense of identity and is their world . so for a person to refuse to

continuously messaging someone expecting them to answer when they re offline , etc etc . i suppose it s somewhat important to me , because i believe that most people deserve basic respect and a

warming , personal freedoms in social reform , common core and other education iniatives , domestic terrorism , healthcare , etc . however . . . while i recognize that politics is important , i don t

also depends on why they have no money either whether it s due to unfortunate circumstances , or conversely , whether it s due to sheer laziness or not wanting to find a job . this sort of question

t be following you . thanks for the follow , though .","313299":"if you place importance on sex , then yes . . . however , not all relationships place importance on sex and it s important to understand that relationships work on varying levels of dynamic . what s important to your relationship may be meaningless to another , and vice versa .","313300":"my day to day life is fairly boring these days . if you asked me this question five years ago , oh man you would have been very entertained lol . i have a full time job where i work monday through friday from am pm . i m in a long term relationship , but my boyfriend s work hours can be hectic at times , especially when he lands side work on top of his regular job . we try to see each other at least three times per week , but sometimes it s only once or twice depending on the circumstances . we normally just hang at home since we re usually exhausted , but sometimes we ll grab food or go to the bar . i also have a best friend who s getting married october . we don t see each other very often , but lately i ve been trying to hang out with her more so we can focus on wedding planning . we found a new coffee shop in town , so i expect we ll be spending a lot of nights there brainstorming ! ! the rest of my time is spent at doctors appointments and therapy . i ve been seeing my pdoc every weeks , and i was in therapy every weeks as well it s supposed to be weekly but it s expensive . when i use social media , it s normally in between all of these things which is why you mostly see me on askfm on the weekends and intermittently during the week .","313301":"i know plenty of people who have been in successful open relationships . if you trust your partner s and establish a strong foundation of communication , i believe it can be useful for a lot of people especially in instances where perhaps someone is hypersexual but their partner has a travelling job , like one couple i know . i personally wouldn t be able to do so myself because i have a tendency to be somewhat co dependent on my partners , and i wouldn t like the concept of sharing because i am always afraid of my partners leaving me for someone better . but i won t knock the concept of open relationships for others because i ve seen relationships where they ve worked .","313302":"i really don t understand how you re making these assumptions about people you clearly don t know when you sent that post out as a mass message on askfm , lol . thank you for pointing out an actor s discrepancy during a time when blm is in full swing . but it s unrealistic for you to expect a band of people to boycott a television show because of one livejournal post from over a year ago on a topic that s been settled for ages . i m all for calling out problematic behavior , but you can t simply focus on one situation while simultaneously ignoring the rest . looking at situations objectively is important in prioritizing what to call attention to .","313303":"he said something that s been interpreted as racist yes , i agree . however , i m looking at the situation objectively . he acknowledged the post and clarified the situation . i m sure he apologized for it as well , but that livejournal post failed to post it i m assuming either to suit it s own cause or simply because he had not done so yet . in addition , he s done a vast array of charitable work for people from all walks of life with no personal benefit to himself . if you weigh out the factors involved in misha collins life , it s easy to see that he s a charitable human being who made one mistake . to boycott a television show for that is a bit foolish , especially considering all of the other actors and actresses on that show who also run charity organizations , donate money to relief causes , raise awareness for important issues , etc .","313304":"why are you sending out something that s been said , done with , and taken care of that s from over a year ago ? ? idk as much about misha collins at least not as much as wincestdestiel or aribackup lol but based on his history of charitable efforts , time spent helping other people in need , and sacrifice to others , he doesn t seem like he s anything close to being a racist . lay it to rest , friend .","313305":"because the government doesn t want its schools being taught that the very establishment of north america as a european colony in the name of patriotism has been a big , fat lie . they really should name it indigenous people s day so that we can recognize the native lives who were lost that day and the concurrent rxpe , pillage , enslavement , and genocide of native americans . but teaching that to children is apparently too much , even though children have a much greater sense of understanding of foreign concepts than adults do .","313306":"in order to change genders , i would need a gender at a starting point from which to change , lol . so the answer is no .","313307":"this actually reminds me of something i saw on facebook regarding the term dude being a gendered greeting versus a gender neutral term . i ve always considered it to be gender neutral because i would always refer to someone as dude regardless of their gender . but recently , it seems it has offended people due to their culture growing up and that term expressing more masculine than feminine associations . linguistics is interesting .","313308":"i m not a huge fan of multiplayer games , tbh . then only game i m comfortable playing with a multiplayer server is destiny lol . every other multiplayer game i ve played has been on a private server because people are assholes online .","313309":"i understand that it stems from a branch of gaming culture , but me not hearing the term

bowels of the internet .","313311":"i see . idk , coming out as trans or as gay or basically everything else that isn t aligned with our society has both its benefits and its risks . sometimes people who come out end up losing their friends and family , because they don t support them . sometimes it puts them in danger because there are some people who will resort to violent means to hurt people who are trans or gay . so while , yes , it is great to celebrate when a trans or gay friend comes out to the public so they can be accepted as who they truly are , they re also taking tremendous risks as well .","313312":"i d think so , yeah . it basically insinuates that people who suffer from addiction have similar traits or fall under the same demographics , which is presumptuous because drug addiction can look like anyone . in addition , drug addiction is a mental condition by itself in the dsm v and can present co morbid with other mental illnesses .","313313":"why are you answering your own self imposed question . . . in my own inbox . . . ? ? people never cease to amaze me .","313314":"i ve always interpreted it as a devious face , not something that denotes sadness or anything . thanks for the concern , though .","313315":"so it appears that my is being spread for those who have received it , i apologize that someone thought they were clever enough to spread my page around the internet in such a foolish manner . if you receive it , please delete it and don t feed into their attempts to ridicule me . in addition , this is a good example of people attempting to talk over transgender people with respect to their rights . my pronouns aren t for anyone else to decide , which is why i ve conveniently placed them in my bio for everyone to see . the fact that they re purposely putting my identity out for debate is a bit redundant . hope everyone has a good day . ?","313316":"this is pretty typical of the us public education program growing up , we were actually taught that christopher columbus was a good man who discovered america and happily made peace with the native americans , etc etc . this point of view lasted from toddler age up until my graduation from high school . i was never taught the reality of what columbus and his crew did to the native americans . myself and my classmates were never formally educated on the mass genocide of native americans through slaughter and by the introduction of foreign disease . we were all left blindsided in the attempt to shield us from what truly happened so that our sense of patriotism remained intact . so these days , columbus day is a damn joke of a holiday . government businesses are given the day off from work to celebrate , but i personally don t find the celebration of mass genocide to be particularly cheerful . stop giving columbus credit for something he never did . stop praising him for finding america and start recognizing the brutality that was inflicted upon the native people . start calling it indigenous people s day as a reminder of all whom we ve lost , and start spreading awareness of the small numbers of americans who exist today who are native . native americans experience an absurd amount of oppression and ridicule on a daily basis , and this isn t recognized enough in society .","313317":"aw lol thank you ! !","313318":"the past months or so , it s been incredibly hard for me to wake up . i don t get much restorative sleep , and most of my sleep is in rem sleep so whenever i wake up , i feel as if i haven t slept at all . i don t normally hit snooze at all though , because i know that if i do , i m not getting out of bed at all that day . for instance , last night i passed out around midnight and i didn t crawl out of bed until maybe pm . it s not even pm and its still hard for me to keep my eyes open .","313319":"people disregarding it or refusing to accept it as fact because they believe that they know better than myself about what my own gender is .","313320":"of trump supporters are actually more dense than trump himself , and it makes me cringe whenever i find one in my inbox . their rationale when it comes to defending his statements makes absolutely no sense .","313321":"i really hope this doesn t get flagged down , but this meme actually made me laugh my ass off gasp in shock ohh my goddd . ?","313322":"modern day i think it s third wave ? feminism can go one of two ways it s full of objective facts and focuses on the oppression of unrepresented minority groups with a plethora of credible resources or it s full of misinformation due to the concept of a mob mentality and advocates tend to strive for attention as opposed to the genuine representation of legitimate social , economic , legal , and cultural problems . while social media has been incredibly useful in helping information and movements spread like wildfire , it can also have the adverse effect when misinformation and uneducated ideas are spread just as fast . a lot of people fail to fact check their sources or choose to rely on sources that aren t known for their credibility .","313323":"i agree , yes . nothing physiologically changes when a person has sex for the first time , so the notion that a person becomes different after sex is purely cultural in nature . in most western cultures , a woman specifically can be seen as prude or timid if she s chosen not to have sex for the first time even when she s as young as preteen years and men also face discrimination from their peers if they re found that they haven t engaged in sex . it s all based on the oversexualization of our culture and how most ideas revolve around the idea of sex , unfortunately .","313324":"i don t even ask people questions .","313325":"if a mother is drinking while she s pregnant and she plans on bringing that pregnancy to term , then the child will likely have a plethora of medical problems if it isn t miscarried . i don t really understand the confusion here . . . people who are pro choice aren t anti pregnancy or something . but if you re an expecting mother and you want to give birth to a child , then don t potentially ruin that child s life by drinking during pregnancy . that s so irresponsible .","313326":"a fetus doesn t have the neurological development to feel pain , or have any feelings whatsoever . . . it s merely a parasite

pregnant and wants to bring the pregnancy to term , why in the hell would someone want to screw that up ? being pro choice means that you respect a person s choice regarding what they want to do with their pregnancy , whether it s wanted or unwanted .","313328":"pregnant women shouldn t drink anywhere . that s extremely harmful to the fetus .","313329":". . . you aren t required to drink if you go

sickening that people still support him after knowing how he feels towards women .","313331":"i agree . cisgender men do face a lot of discrimination , which is also unfair and deserves attention too .","313332":"damn , talk about assumptions and accusations . i m responsible with my drinking . regardless of how much i drink , i m always aware of my surroundings . the fact that i drank at this event means i was comfortable with the crowd i was around . most of them were teenagers to young adults , and this community is the type of community to go out of their way to help you if you re not in a good place . for example before the show , we were waiting out in the pouring rain for the doors to open . i went to step over a dislodged brick , tripped over it , and fell into a puddle . at least people ran over to ask if i was ok and if you ve ever been to ny , you know that s rare . also , it s a seated event . we were all sitting in the floor area , in the balconies , around the stage , around the bar , etc . it s a highly esteemed ballroom , so there were security guards every feet . so before you go out of your way to attempt to troll a stranger on the internet , at least know what the hell you re talking about . lmao .","313333":"hell no . i have more self respect than to actively support a person who is undeniably racist , sexist , and completely uneducated on foreign

perspectives when relaying information hi fox news .","313352":"wow that s a name i haven t heard in years lol .","313353":"that s pretty hypocritical . being pro choice means you respect a person s decision to make choices regarding their own body i . e . abortion . it s the understanding that you cannot legally force a person to undergo a medical procedure without their consent . in that same vein , why would a man be forced to be neutered if it s against his choice ? i understand its a difficult concept to swallow , but bodily autonomy doesn t only apply where you see fit . plus , this doesn t take into account the abortions a person may have for reasons other than being sxxually assaulted .","313354":"no . i m pro choice and i would get an abortion if the situation called for it .","313355":"autobiographical sketches , psychological thrillers , fantasy , and dramas having to do with mental illness , addiction , death , etc .","313356":"seeing the clowns is a high possibility where i live because a group of them have been going from town to town and terrorizing high schools , and the police still haven t narrowed down who s behind them yet . my old high school was put on lock down one day last week because someone in a clown costume with a weapon was spotted across the street . i probably wouldn t do anything . it wouldn t surprise me if i graduated high school with these assholes because my class was a fucking joke lmao .","313357":"opinions aren t objective , and being open minded is also somewhat of a subjective assessment as well . if you don t know who i am , then how could you conversely say that i m narrow minded without a frame of reference ? this makes no sense .","313358":"my self perception is a wee bit more credible than an anonymous stranger who evidently has no clue who i am .","313359":"yeah that s pretty racist .","313360":"it sounds like a good idea in theory , but i don t know much about them tbh . they would do the same thing as dash cameras do , and its always good to have something objective like a video to rely on as extra evidence .","313361":"she s a human being with children , feelings , and emotions whose life was threatened at gunpoint . you don t have to like someone to feel empathy for her in that situation . her being rich or famous doesn t invalidate her experience , and its disgusting that people are

research foundation you had the option of adding , , or to the end of the transaction , or nothing at all . there was one customer i ll never forget , i asked if he would like to donate to st . jude s and he snapped at me , fuck no , they should be donating money to me . i was so mad and in shock tbh .","313364":"what reason would i have to lie ? ? unlike you , i m a mature adult and if i did say

haven t seen the movie though .","313368":"my boyfriend . he s not only my partner , but also my best friend . i don t feel afraid to ever tell him anything that s on my mind , he s incredibly open minded and honest , and he challenges me to make myself into the best version of myself . on the days i self isolate and can t get out of bed , he drags me out and motivates me to start moving again . i m so grateful that he puts up with me .","313369":"i prefer psychological thrillers anti hero action films and silly comedies .","313370":"obviously i believe in it , lol . censorship is important because some material can be harmful to people .","313371":"serotonin .","313372":"i enjoyed college because i enjoyed learning and valued the classes i was taking . however , i often feel like i never had a genuine college experience because i mostly took night classes and spent a large part of my week at work . i commuted to school and had a part time job , so i rarely had much time for socialization . . . and when i did , i didn t exactly partake in smart activities ahah .","313373":"i ve smoked cuban cigars as well as cigarellos . i used to love smoking the wine flavored black and

.","313381":"maybe it s only been a week then . i have a really terrible concept of time . either way , i did talk to someone on here about this video briefly .","313382":"don t you think that people should know and care though ? ? why would a person be comfortable living in willful ignorance when the reality of the world is vastly different than what they choose to believe ? ?","313383":"transgender people aren t obscure though ? ? idk what argument you re trying to make .","313384":"until it directly affects them , they don t . then they think their whole relationship has been compromised , lmao .","313385":"yes , i m under the trans umbrella . i m agender .","313386":"idk why people would feel the urge to bring a weapon with them to places they know they won t need it like to the grocery store or something . sure , it may make them feel safe but tbh the idea of me walking around a shopping center not knowing who could potentially hurt me is incredibly frightening .","313387":"seriously lol why the fuck are we either treated like less than dirt or , conversely , novelty items to place on someone s shelf of being a good person ? ? i m sick of it .","313388":"nope , this is reality . you re welcome to check in whenever you d like .","313389":"i m sure she would never want to date you either .","313390":"i support donald trump . you ? slams head into wall","313391":"none ? ? the fuck .","313392":"idk i just always assumed that people thought new yorkers were angry which isn t far from the truth tbh .","313393":"looks at profile picture nope , absolutely hate flannel shirts . most uncomfortable clothing ever . do not recommend .","313394":"because i don t remember ? ? i can t remember anything about my life before i was like years old . and the flashes of moments that i do remember , idk if they re even real memories or scenarios my brain has imagined to fill in the blanks .","313395":"i don t really send out questions like a spam or anything it was just a question i had in mind so i decided to send it to those i followed to get their input . sorry ! !","313396":"i agree . people are ridiculed for being thin , being curvy , being overweight , having disabilities , etc . society is so quick to judge a person by what they look like that they completely overlook who that person is . it s sickening . there are so many double standards when it comes to the media and marketing and how men and women should look that they re compromised even when they re great at their job .","313397":"i support the blm movement because racism is basically an epidemic in this country , and its resulting in a lot of poc being killed discriminated against ridiculed against unjustly . while i think that sometimes the movement has gone a bit overboard i . e . people have now jumped to assumptions regarding some situations without looking at the facts of the case , i still support the intention of the movement . that being said , i don t think it takes away from other issues of oppression marginalized groups . saying that blm doesn t mean that no other lives matter , which is a big misconception . you can simultaneously advocate for blm and recognize that there are other important issues to also address like islamphobia , lgbt discrimination , ableism , antisemitism , sexism , etc .","313398":"there s a big difference between supporting our veterans and supporting our government s decision to engage in warfare . i disagree with the government of the time with respect to invading other countries in war for their alleged benefit . i m pretty anti military in that regard because i feel that our country escalates situations and makes other under privileged communities worse . at the same time , i respect the troops who are forcibly sent to those places and risk their lives . i respect veterans who have found themselves making terrible life or death decisions and have witnessed death on a daily basis . i advocate for the awareness of veteran health rights because all too often , veterans are homeless and can t get the proper medical treatment they need in the aftermath of their tours .","313399":"someone s overreacting a bit . i said that people who supported trump were idiotic . if you don t support trump , then idk why you re taking offense to my statement .","313400":"people who don t use blinkers . people who decide to change lanes right in front of me even though there s no one behind me . people who text and drive . people who talk on the phone with one hand and drive with the other hand . people who decide to make a quick right and cut me off as i m clearly driving down the road . i hate trucks . taxi drivers are literally the rudest fucking drivers i ve ever met . people who ride me purposely . watch me as i go as slow as possible and brake intermittently . i can play that game too . after work i always get stuck behind a school bus at least once a week and it takes me forever to get home , oh my god .","313401":"i don t have a youtube channel for videos , no . i have one to watch videos but i don t really upload any of my own .","313402":"i agree , like there are people who are legitimately suffering because they re trans and nobody is helping them . the whole otherkin shit makes legitimate gender issues look like a joke .","313403":"hate is taught , not bred . if you grow up in an environment where racist or sexist or discriminatory concepts reign free , then you may also exhibit those same thoughts .","313404":"happy first day of halloween . ? ?","313405":"gags until i m six feet under","313406":"my boyfriend actually loves when i mess around with my hair , lol . regardless , it s just hair . who gives a shit . it s a means of self expression . if he didn t like the things i ve done to my hair , he would have dumped me years ago when i showed up to his prom with a bleach white pixie cut .","313407":"guys i made my hair do the thing .","313408":"well then . so my nails are almost long enough to be made into claws . ?","313409":"well now i know you definitely don t know me , lmfao .","313410":"? ? you re the one who believes sex is the same as gender , dude . you can t argue logic when you can t properly define two distinct concepts of being .","313411":"do you feel special now that you believe you have infiltrated the feminist base with your lackluster wit and worn out taglines .","313412":"if people are referring to other relationships as perfect , i can only imagine that they re viewing that relationship solely from the exterior . perfection doesn t exist it s an illusion . everyone has problems and flaws , and every relationship will experience ups and downs . if a couple seems too good to be true , well it probably is lol .","313413":"lmao what . i m like the unhealthiest person i know .","313414":"idk what kind of benefit you would get out of staying in a long term relationship with someone you didn t love . . . at that point , you re just cheating yourself out of finding someone you can fall in love with and be happy with .","313415":"i ve fallen in love with my boyfriend countless times . human relationships are constantly evolving and growing , and every stage of our lives we endure erupt another flame within me .","313416":"i do , actually .","313417":"i ve never cheated on anyone . if i fell out of love with my boyfriend which i doubt will ever happen , i would simply talk to him about my feelings instead of betraying his trust .","313418":"i can t be friends with someone who s

describe me and he said quirky and adorable so there ya go .","313426":"aw lol why , the subject matter ? ? i can understand why you d feel that way tbh , a lot of their cases are gruesome and they don t hold back much when filming bodies .","313427":"because it s the only way ignorant people can justify why they believe the economy sucks . it s easier to deflect blame onto someone else in this case a minority group smh than to admit your own system of capitalism has flaws which is no surprise .","313428":"i didn t know she supported that . i honestly can t trust a word she says , though , so no doubt she ll say that she supports paid maternity and paternity leave and do absolutely nothing about it .","313429":"and then those same girls are the ones who are rxped and murdered simply

how wrong hilary is and how he thinks stop and frisk is a great idea .","313445":"everything . it s literally everything that comes out of his mouth .","313446":"yes , it is ! !","313447":"i disagree with the death penalty . i think it s hypocritical and barbaric to kill someone as a method of punishment for them doing the same thing . it isn t fiscally appropriate to keep prisoners on death row , and sometimes these same prisoners end up being found innocent years later . solitary confinement is more appropriate , in my opinion . sitting alone with nothing but your thoughts and no human interaction can be punishment enough for most people .","313448":"i believe that its the government s job to take care of its citizens , so the money that is being allocated through taxes should be benefitting those in our society who are unable to provide for their basic needs food , shelter , water , heathcare , etc . as for tuition , i support greatly reduced tuition for public universities because the price of obtaining a higher education is atrocious at the moment . students end up being in debt for most of their lives , and the money they make with their subsequent jobs ends up going towards paying off that debt , making it even harder for them to adjust to the price of living in our society .","313449":"the way that i see it , freedom of expression means that you have the right to express your support in the way your government is running the country , as well as the right to express your distaste for it as well . when it comes to personal freedoms , you can t selectively pick and choose between notions that support your cause and then criticizing notions that criticize it . not standing for the pledge or not reciting the pledge is your personal choice , and the reason why we have that freedom to choose is because of these amendments .","313450":"there should definitely be stricter laws regarding the process of purchasing a gun nationwide . while some criminal undoubtedly will find some way to get one by illegal means , it would definitely deter a lot of people knowing that they would have to go through that process . i still think everyone should have a right to protect themselves and their family , though . one family owning a handgun for emergency purposes isn t too extreme in my opinion , but it shouldn t go any further than that . nobody needs automatic assault weapons .","313451":"yes , you caught me .","313452":"considering i know people who have done so , yes . it takes a lot of determination and a strong will to remain sober , but for some people it s not impossible .","313453":"ask me this years ago , i would have said hell yes . these days , i m uncomfortable with the idea . . . between my mental state and the medication i m on ,

friend to get ready to buy supplies for my hair , so i did some bomb ass makeup .","313460":"i understand that . . . but my answer remains the same lol .","313461":"on the surface , yes . obviously it depends on the individual though . . . the us is made up of a myriad of people of different cultural backgrounds so often the culture of the us is simply a conglomerate of all of these cultures combined .","313462":"or how about abortions remain legal because they re safe , effective , and life saving medical procedures .","313463":"i know that sometimes psychological evaluations are necessary for some surgeries , but the way the question was worded made it sound like people who were transgender had a mental illness for feeling as such .","313464":"in that case , no . you were invited to take part in their festivities which is perfectly fine","313465":"why would you celebrate a holiday that holds no cultural significance to you ? ?","313466":"i have , actually ! ! it was an incredibly good show and i can t wait for season two .","313467":"omfg , nooo . . . i absolutely hate my middle name and i wish it didn t exist .","313468":"this is honestly the first i ve heard about

government healthcare systems and other financial aid systems . granted i believe that there should be better distribution of the money for example , not towards war efforts smh but our taxes are supposed to aid the country as a whole .","313471":"lol i wish . no , i simply don t face certain discriminations solely because i m white . unfortunately , people of color are oppressed in today s society and discriminated against so unjustly that it puts those who are white on a higher pedestal simple due to their race .","313472":"things that are perhaps too personal for me to discuss , such as my sex life , my past history of abuse , crime related incidents in my life , etc . there s a difference between being honest and incriminating yourself . while i m honest online of the time , there are simply topics that i will refuse to discuss .","313473":"parks and rec . ?","313474":"i ve always had an acute sense of hearing , particularly towards music . i like how i m able to

like a bitch . so i told him , there s nothing wrong with ray , you re just acting like an asshole . he looked genuinely shocked , like no one has ever called him out before ? ? but he was silent the

younger ones are probably more up on what s going on especially with everyone coming out as transgender i m sure there s a lot of people who need someone more understanding . and i stood there for a minute internally screaming like how does she know i m trans wtf but idk if she actually meant it that way or not . then again when i came out to my best friend when i thought i was genderfluid , she was like . . . i ve known that for years dude , you didn t ? ?","313483":"lmao i recently did this on twitter ig . chloe from life is strange , nancy from the craft , and tyrion from game of thrones

fucking long text message saying how she wants to sit down and talk with me about my emotions and feelings and what s wrong with me . i m so fucking irritated now . did you ever stop to think that maybe just maybe you re the root of all of my problems ? you re a narcissistic , overbearing person who is the bane of my existence and no , making yourself out to be a good person will not magically

their life despite all of the obstacles against him . they ve been through hell and back again , but they don t let their experiences discourage them from chasing their dreams . that s so inspiring to me .","313531":"that awkward moment when you say a word too much and question how to even say it anymore lmao .","313532":"this is the shittiest collage i ve ever made , but i follow too many people

.","313546":"hi mister potato head","313547":"i agree somewhat at that age , it may be premature for a couple to live together especially since its such a transitional age for most young adults . while every relationship will have its successes and pitfalls , i believe that moving in together at such a young age would enforce a lot of responsibilities onto young people that they perhaps aren t quite ready for , on top of the other extraneous relationship stresses . i lived with my boyfriend when we were younger , and tbh it actually made our relationship a bit worse because we suffocated one another and we were too young to really know how to handle that kind of responsibility . after i moved out , our relationship got a lot better and we learned from the experience .","313548":"lol

comes a close second , but lately art has been more frustrating rather than cathartic , haha .","313555":"if they re doing it purposely just to manipulate your feelings , then that s a pretty dick move . but if they don t realize they re sending mixed signals to someone , then they re not a bad person . they just need to be told that you have feelings for them and that the way they behave is giving you false hope .","313556":"genetics ? ? everyone on my mother s side is pretty short too . my cousin is only or so . and one of my cousins on my dad s side is also short despite the rest of

there s little we can do to stop it . there was an explosion in manhattan last night from a man made explosive device , and they found another one a few blocks down that had not yet been detonated , made similarly to the explosive that caused all of the death and chaos during the boston marathon . perhaps its scary to me because it s so close to home , but it just reiterates my fear that nowhere

because i m worthy enough to accept treatment and find happiness .","313566":"i agree that teachers are very underpaid for the work they do their jobs aren t just a to job , most teachers are awake at the crack of dawn and stay up late into the night grading papers , offering extra help to students , talking with parents , creating lesson plans , etc . being a teacher is probably one of the most mentally straining jobs there are , and they definitely don t get paid enough for the work they do and for the impact they can have on their students . many teachers are literally life changing forces in a student s life .","313567":"idk if i feel like laughing or crying right now . my partner s ex just had a gender reveal party because she s pregnant , and my best friend picked her wedding venue
