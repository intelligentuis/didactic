   32-34 B is still beautiful. Beauty is all sizes since it’s inside you that counts. But you do look stunning. And besides, too big is no good either because that’s all people notice and look at. DD bra size for example is just a distraction from the person herself.  You’re still amazing and pretty.

   Where does your self-worth come from?
  ","
  Self-worth is an internal state of being that comes from self-understanding, self-love, and self-acceptance. It's a state that is somewhat timeless and unchanging because it's a direct measure of how you value and regard yourself in spite of what others may say or do.

   Oh you have an LG unit. I have a GE. I have a question. When your unit hits a certain temp does it stop blowing cold air and is just a fan, and then when it ticks up a few degrees it will go back to cold air? Or does it just blow cold air no matter how freezing it gets in your room?
  ","
  if i have my setting on cold i can put it on 60 and it will still be on cold
  "
365606,"
   Also you should consider getting some thick strips of insulation and put it over the side panels. I did that with mine so it's like bricked in and it helps a lot because those side panels really don't do a great job of keeping out the humidity from the outside.

   The past few weeks I've been hanging out with one of my friends.  Last weekend we went to a bar. I can tell he's starting to get feelings for me. I don't want to break his heart, but i just wants to be friends with him. How can i get him to not be hurt when i tell him i only want to be friends?
  ","
  there’s really no way to avoid hurting him cause i’ve been there done that, you just have to casually bring up in conversation you’re not looking for anything romantic and would love to be good friends

   A mirror might look silver because it's usually depicted that way in books or movies. However, it's actually the color of whatever is reflected onto it. A perfect mirror has specular reflection, meaning it reflects all light in a single direction equal to what it receives.

   I mean you just said he is a nice guy who makes you laugh and smile so it would be the same thing even if he was a deadbeat dad so I don’t underStand cause it wouldn’t effect you since he would be treating you the same either way.

  No, it wouldn’t. I used to let my exes abuse me, belittle me, one i almost had a child with and thank GOD i didn’t because karma came around and smacked his ass hard. Everything causes a change in other things so what you’re saying doesn’t line up. End of discussion.

  Also let’s put this into perspective, my little sister grew up not knowing she had a father. She was a product of an affair, he never showed up to court, moved out of state with his WHOLE ASS FAMILY HE ALREADY HAD, i was 12 when she was born, and i raised her as if i was her parent. That “man” came into her life when she was 8 and whisked my best friend away from me. I hate him with everything i am, with his family as well. I have major first hand experience with dead beats and i don’t tolerate that shit never have never will. Any other questions?

  Not many people have it easy, which is what you have to try and understand. I’ve had a chronic disease with no cure for 11 years exactly coming up in 3 weeks, i’ve been through massive loads of horrible trauma that i’ve yet to fully recover from, i could go on but the point is you have to at least try to better your outlook. i’ve attempted to kill myself about 5 times now, and now it’s been a while since the last bc i’m actively trying to find reasons to stay. it’s all how you talk to yourself and control your thoughts.

  I asked you like an hour ago and you said no ._.
  "
367898,"
   And the rest of the others? Lol how do they fit?
  ","
  I answered
  "
367899,"
   Tell you what, if you tell me how all of the people you've named matter to you or not and wether they're important to you. Then I'll reveal myself to you I promise, but you have to be fully honest and say how they all fit.
  ","
  dakota and Jacob fit into the on and off friends, Roberto Shelton and Nathan fit into the making sure I was okay, faith Krista shanda Candice Alison and Amanda fit into the felt like sisters, Joe and Denver fit into the best guy friends that I could laugh about anything with, Zach and Matthew fitinto the bestfriend that ended up the wrong way, Quent fits into the helped me realize I needed to stay alive, Dawson fits into the always made me smile and Austin fits into the guy that always had the best advice. okay?
  "
367900,"
   Haha what if I ak though? Maybe I'm part of that group and they're the ones who don't really matter to you or maybe I'm part of the ones you just named.
  ","
  I mentioned everyone I graduated with
  "
367901,"
   So what about the rest of the ones you've mention as well?
  ","
  how come it matters if you aren't any of those other people? lol
  "
367902,"
   No you did not. That was your last hint, from now on I can no longer give any hints because any further hints could give me away.
  ","
  Okay well that leaves Roy Shelton & Jacob. Roy & I were pretty good friends, I liked talking to him all year. Jacob and I were also pretty good friends, especially for a month or two, then stuff kinda went blah. and Shelton always helped me out but we don't talk anymore so.
  "
367903,"
   Haha maybe maybe not but this is the only way to be sure lol. Because then it allows for you to answer with out any influences that might alter your response. You already know who I am  because I  told you that you mentioned me
  ","
  but did I mention you in my short list?
  "
367904,"
   And Id like to know if Iv made a positive impact or not and wether or not I'm important to you lol
  ","
  if you tell me who you are I will straight up tell you if you have and if you haven't, I don't lie.
  "
367905,"
   Haha still trying to figure me out, yet you never will I can tell you that much.
  ","
  but I wanna freaking know
  "
367906,"
   You said you'd narrow it down, did you narrow it down to people that have made an impact or just someone you had a class with?
  ","
  I narrowed it down to who I think you could be.
  "
367907,"
   So then who the names you just narrows down?
  ","
  sorry what?
  "
367908,"
   are those the names that have made an impact and that you want to keep in your life? Or just people you know but don't care much about?
  ","
  I care about all of them.
  "
367909,"
   Here Ill make it a tad more comforting, you did mention my name in that list earlier.
  ","
  okay I'll narrow it down. Austin, Dakota, Roberto, Zach.
  "
367910,"
   Because I wanna see if you mention me as a person who is important to you, if I told you who i am that would alter your response therefore it wouldn't be from your heart.
  ","
  ok well tbh i really don't remember much from this past year except for a few very very bad memories, with my nerve stuff it wipes my memory so I don't remember many people that helped me out.....
  "
367911,"
   Maybe the only reason it's hard for you to answer is because you know who you've neglected and are afraid to admit it upfront. It's really not too difficult to say who matters and have made an impact and who don't and have not made one in your life.
  ","
  I seriously can't think of anyone I've ""neglected"" oh I left Zach out earlier
  "
367912,"
   Haha yes, but that doesn't mean you have it to me. So now you're back to square one again
  ","
  why can't you tell me who you are? did we date? did we have a thing? we're we just friends? do I barely k ow you?
  "
367913,"
   send a pic of your boobs?
  ","
  no thanks
  "
367914,"
   Haha sometimes we have to answer did cult questions with simple answers. And that's for you to decide if you did mention me or not lol
  ","
  I mean, one class, and we talked, that gives me sixteen thousand options right there. ok at LEAST give me this, do you have my phone number?
  "
367915,"
   Well who is impact and who is just a memory of people
  ","
  I DONT KNOW THIS IS STARTONG TO FEEL LIKE THE MOVIE SAW
  "
367916,"
   are you a virgin
  ","
  yeah
  "
367917,"
   Answer very carefully because You only have one strike life so be wise in how you word your next response lol
  ","
  I don't like this :c did I mention you???
  "
367918,"
   Well there's a reason I'm not giving you any hints haha it's suppose to be anonymous remember lol. And so all those people are just people you remember having a class with or people who actually are apart of your life and have made an impact?
  ","
  some of them are people in my class, some are because impact.
  "
367919,"
   How big are your boobs

  ","
  ok uh, there was Nathan, dakota, Roy, faith, Shelton, shanda Amanda Candice Alison Kelsey, Joe, Austin, Dawson, Quent, Matt, Denver, Krista, Jacob, Roberto and yeah that's all I can think of right now since you won't give me any more hints
  "
367921,"
