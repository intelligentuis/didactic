Enjoy!\u201d\n  ","851926":"\n  \u201cThe ask fm Q & A page answers that but you pretty much got to prove that you are an actual person who run the account and its not off of who your profile picture is on its just that the user name is \/you\/ and that you care and that you are a VIP first before you can be verified.\u201d\n  ","851927":"\n  \u201cNo.. a question is a question and if someone if comfortable answering then let them.\u201d\n  ","851928":"\n  \u201cSmelly feet. My god, I rather have one black or yellow toe or something.. they\u2019re both really bad. I mean, I\u2019m joking I like my toes too.

Like a cup of coke or Pepsi with ice in it and all the bubbles are on the side of the cup is something weirdly good to look at, but I just know its bad for you so I don\u2019t have it. I like its taste but I don\u2019t like it often because its bad for my teeth and body.\u201d\n  ","851938":"\n  \u201cJuly!\u201d \/\/ August!\n  ","851939":"\n  \u201cI didn\u2019t know they were types of waffles, but really waffles are not my thing nor is pancakes I don\u2019t remember the last time I had pancakes or waffles.\u201d\n  ","851940":"\n  \u201cA small kitchen light and one outside security light that\u2019s really dim won\u2019t hurt or like a dim front door light.
