I am lucky to be a fairly talented visual artist, so it wouldn't be fair if I was also a good musical artist lol.\n  ","169645":"\n  I don't go out of my way to listen but I won't be upset if someone else is listening\n  ","169646":"\n  Bears, I guess.

The last book I read was Siddhartha again, last month.\n  ","169653":"\n  I wash my feet.\n  ","169654":"\n  Probably very calmly, actually.  Despite having serious mental illnesses based on anxiety and panic, I do surprisingly well in immediate emergency situations. I would probably keep guard and call the police, do my best not to touch anything, and try to remember anything unusual I noticed near or around the body.\n  \n  Maybe it would be different if I'd never seen dead bodies before, I don't know.\n  ","169655":"\n  my first house was white with black trim, my second home was a tan and brick apartment building with maroon trim, the house I finished out school in was white with blue trim at first that was later painted dark green.\n  ","169656":"\n  I have chronic panic disorder and am panicked multiple times daily. Thankfully I am on beta blockers now that keep my body from going into full panic attack from each instance any longer, so I only have about 1-2 panic attacks a week instead of 12 or so a day.\n  \n  The last moment of panic was about an hour ago when the booth behind us at dinner's waiter was talking so loudly and for so long while using his hands in grand gestures and taking up so much aisle space that I felt intruded on in both a physical and auditory way and it made me panic.\n  ","169657":"\n  Not really, but I do love Easter candy. When I was 4, I had really vivid dreams for a while, and Easter fell into that time period that year. I dreamed that I saw a large pink rabbit- not a cartoon, or a man in a suit, but an actual gigantic rabbit that was also pink- in my house laying eggs. The dream was realistic enough that I believed it and I was really surprised when I found out that the eggs in my basket the next morning were plastic because I'd seen those at the store and it was not what I expected. I believed in the Easter bunny for several years after I stopped believing in Santa Claus for this reason- the dream was just really realistic, I was convinced.\n  ","169658":"\n  I've not heard the saying before but I think that it's probably true for at least some folks.

Conservatives in this country are so blinded by tradition and \"values\" that they can't comprehend anything that seems to oppose that or at least offers a different viewpoint. Compassion and justice are less important to them than the words in a book written by white men with delusions of grandeur. Not that I'm anti-religion, because I absolutely am not- I think that it's comforting to think that there's a God above who looks over us- but if that's the case then I feel pretty strongly that he or she wants us to progress and be good to each other and our communities, not continuously knock down anyone outside of the white cis straight male Christian demographic.\n  \n  It's hard not to think that it's an intelligence thing. I've never been especially impressed by the intelligence of any very conservative citizens. The smartest conservatives I've met were also working for social justice despite their political and religious views.\n  ","169662":"\n  I was at a retro game convention and stressing out because of the crowd, trying to calm down and cool off enough that I could maybe look at vendors again or wait for a turn to play Carnival or Yar's Revenge in the retrocade and Jon decided to go see what the local indie devs were showing and dragged me over there even though I was definitely not calm enough to do so yet. There was a game that was really quite eye-catching called Smooth Operator and I talked to one of the devs for a few moments and she and I played a game- Smooth Op is essentially a kissing simulator, but with style. Kate, the producer, and I got a reallllly high score, meaning our \"kissing\" was really compatible lol. I grabbed her card and followed her on twitter. Over a year later, she's one of my favorite friends.\n  ","169663":"\n  I really try to be. I feel like overall I am a good person, though maybe I fall into selfish panics and anxieties where I'm too weak to help others sometimes. I don't know that that's bad though sometimes I do feel guilty for not being able to do more.\n  ","169664":"\n  having fibrocystic breast disease means I get a heaping helping of both pretty constantly. I'd rather take the pain than the itching. Pain I can smoke or sleep away, the itching is deep and gnawing and hard to appease.\n  ","169665":"\n  nah. Mondays are just another day.\n  ","169666":"\n  I feel like I've blocked all memories of Monopoly playing in my family as traumatic memories lol. I know we had the game, I know we played it, I know it always resulted in tears and fights, I have no idea what the rules are even at this point or really anything other than I hate that game but I do know that I liked playing the shoe.\n  ","169667":"\n  think about what I'm thankful for and try to send out good thoughts to the people I care or cared about.\n  ","169668":"\n  I've only been to a small amount of weddings actually- when you move around as much as I have, you tend to not get long distance invites or whatever. The few I've been to were enjoyable enough, but yeah, the reception is preferred mainly because I like to see how people decorate and also cake.\n  ","169669":"\n  I choose truth.

I played tennis in middle school, and in high school and college I participated in pick-up soccer, softball, and football occasionally just to run off some energy but I'm not much of a sports person past that. I DO like to watch youtube women's MMA fights sometimes, and kind of root for Meisha Tate but that's the closest to watching sports I'll get.\n  ","169673":"\n  self-care. bubble baths, listening to music, coloring, drawing, watching nature shows, watching movies I like, playing my ukulele, stuff like that.\n  ","169674":"\n  I try to get along with most people regardless of age or whatever but I can't seem to let myself feel very close to people under a certain age (older hasn't ever bothered me). There's just a level of maturity that can't be reached without life experience I think and with my anxiety levels as they are I don't have a ton of patience for learners and beginners in my close personal life.\n  ","169675":"\n  a heat gun used to melt wax.

Which is kind of pathetic.\n  \n  So I dunno. Thank you Kate, Brooke, Holly, Elisa, Meg- I love all of you even if we barely talk or whatever I do my best to keep up with your lives via social networks and I appreciate you for making me feel like I have good people in my life even when I don't have many people to actually lean on or whatever because of my own standoffishness or because of other reasons or I dunno. I'm having a terrible day depression-wise but these women are important to me even if that's weird.\n  ","169677":"\n  I have a few stuffed toys here and there, but not really anything past that. I left the majority of my childhood things behind at my mother's, and she's since either given them to my sister for her kids to use or thrown them away. I had some stuff I grabbed to take with me when they moved when I was in high school, but that stuff mostly got left behind when I left Massachusetts and I assume is now garbage though for years it sat in the basement of a store I used to work in back in the late 90s.\n  ","169678":"\n  I don't even have normal goals, much less a bucket list. I can't see myself in the future. I can't imagine myself surviving.\n  ","169679":"\n  I share a couple when I start answering, but don't if there are a lot of questions. For instance I've had a dozen or so questions but only shared like, 3 to twitter? Mainly it's so other people might see them and be like \"Oh yeah, that website exists, I should go check that mess out\"- cause I mean, it's not a fast growing site seemingly, or at least I don't personally know many people who use it here in America.\n  ","169680":"\n  I did not know that, thanks for the heads up\n  ","169681":"\n  nope, because I find the phrase distasteful. We no longer refer to places as \"first world\" or \"third world\" we have developed countries and developing countries, and problems are problems no matter how big or small I refuse to be guilted for my feelings because others have it worse. There's always someone who has it worse but that doesn't mean everyone doing a little better can't be upset about shit sometimes.\n  ","169682":"\n  playing ukulele!\n  ","169683":"\n  it is what it is\n  ","169684":"\n  we considered fostering older children if we ever got a house, but we're still living in a very tiny apartment and I don't know that I'm mentally capable of the stress and dedication involved with my current ailments.\n  ","169685":"\n  I have cats and a husband and 5 nephews (2 little, 3 grown) and 1 half niece (baby) and 2 step nieces (grown) but no children.

Nah, the universe doesn't give a shit of you added to it in a meaningful way or not. In a personal sense? Yeah, probably. I know I personally would hate to die without having made positive changes and meant something to someone. Luckily it's not hard to do.

I weigh over 200 lbs and am not a weakling lol she was half of me. It was just a matter of containing her actions and herding her ass out the door. I really wish we had enough money for a down payment on a house I'm so so so sososososososo sick of apartment living.\n  ","169716":"\n  If it had been tested and results were predictable, then yes I'd probably infect myself with something that causes some minor adaptation., akin to a tattoo or whatever. If it was a new tech that hadn't been tested for at least a decade maybe I'd be a bit cautious about it. I wouldn't want to take chances with something that could cause damage over time or could change things past what the expected results were.\n  ","169717":"\n  I generally go for the catch. I'm one of those people who is hopelessly uncoordinated when coordination is expected yet can catch something flying at me by accident without a second thought.\n  ","169718":"\n  positive thought doesn't cure mental illness and neither does being active. This sort of message always strikes me as absolutely ableist.\n  ","169719":"\n  ooh fun! I recommend anything that has pictures you think you'll enjoy coloring, but I personally especially like books that only print pictures on one side of the paper so that you don't  have to worry about ink and markers bleeding through and messing up another page- those that do that AND have perforated edges so you can easily tear them out are my favorite book features. Being left-handed, being able to tear the page out to work on helps me out a lot. Mandala books are very popular, as are patterns and animal and plant designs, but there are coloring books of all sorts out there.

I was most afraid of the giant spider that lived on the roof and would come down to cover the house with it's shadowy legs at night, the guillotine blades that would chop off any body part unfortunate enough to hang over the edge of the bed while I slept, and the shadow man who watched.\n  ","169724":"\n  As for continuing, I hope indie games with non-traditional subject matter and game play keep happening, games feel more like art to me now than they ever have. I was glad to see a few movies recently that didn't rely on women only to fill a romantic role (Fury Road and Force Awakens being my favorite, like everyone else) so that's something I would love to see more of.\n  \n  I wanna squish autotune in pop songs.\n  ","169725":"\n  I could see that being a thing for sure, but nah, it was slow for me before the toggle and it remains slow after lol. I have my core group of people who interact and that's about it.\n  ","169726":"\n  The only fiction book I didn't finish once started was Catch 22 by Joseph Heller. I found it so utterly slow and boring that I couldn't finish.  Maybe I should give it another try one day, but I mean, I struggled through like, James Joyce and finished and couldn't bother with Catch 22 so that's some serious shit.\n  ","169727":"\n  any answer I could honestly give is much too graphic, personal, and traumatic to share for a qotd\n  ","169728":"\n  This is the most difficult question anyone has ever asked me.\n  \n  \"Freebird\"\n  \n  If I leave here tomorrow\n  \n  Would you still remember me?\n  \n  For I must be traveling on now\n  \n  'Cause there's too many places I've got to PEE.\n  \n  But if I stayed here with you, girl,\n  \n  Things just couldn't be the same.\n  \n  'Cause I'm as free as a bird now,\n  \n  And this bird you can not change, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n  \n  And this bird you can not change.\n  \n  And this bird you can not change.\n  \n  Lord knows I can't change.\n  \n  Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah,\n  \n  Though this feeling I can't change.\n  \n  But please don't take it so badly,\n  \n  'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame.\n  \n  But if I stayed here with you, girl,\n  \n  Things just couldn't be the same.\n  \n  'Cause I'm as free as a bird now,\n  \n  And this bird you'll never change, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n  \n  And this bird you cannot change.\n  \n  And this bird you cannot change.\n  \n  Lord knows, I can't change.\n  \n  Lord, help me, I can't change.\n  \n  Lord, I can't change.\n  \n  Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah?\n  \n  (re-answering because I forgot the \"why\" part)\n  \n  because that's what I thought it was growing up and I thought it was reallllly weird that someone talked about peeing in different places in a song and it was (is) hilarious\n  ","169729":"\n  thank you, it's actually been incredibly terrible though.

One thing I struggle with lately is convincing myself that memories aren't \"real\", that they're just my version of things and are viewed differently by others involved. As far as torture, you'd have to have pretty terrible memories consistently for that I suppose, or else be so caught up on past mistakes that you're unable to move forward. My memories aren't mostly torturous, or even half torturous, but some do hurt. Trying to learn to rise above that though.\n  \n  Meanwhile, have you diagnosed us all yet?

For instance if you were to tell me that  worm came out of your ear and granted you three wishes I would respond, \"swut?\"\n  ","169742":"\n  I buy most of my clothes from very cheap places or else second-hand. I haven't ever really been a brand-name person and since most of what I wear are like, men's flannels which are better when they've already been broken in and therefore preferred second hand or else very simple tunics and leggings that can be bought just about anywhere. I have some nicer things that I got on clearance or whatever (a London Fog rain coat trench for under $100 woot!) and because I have joint problems in my toes I do spend a lot on shoes usually but I really could care less about what brands I'm wearing for the most part.\n  ","169743":"\n  I thought I was, I still sort of think I am, but lately I've been doubting how much I should trust my intuition.

Isn't he one of the quintuplets that were on American Horror Story?\n  \n  For the record though, I didn't look up his tattoo but I can tell you that the English folktale of Melusine often depicted her with wings in her true form, even though she was essentially a freshwater mermaid. Of course, she could also look completely human when she wanted as well, and is said to have mothered children with one of the lords of the Plantagenet house, from which I'm descended.....

I don't consider myself really becoming a smoker until I was like, 34 which was after it had already been made legal for recreational use in my state (we'd been legal for medical purposes here since 1998 but I didn't get my medical recommend until after it was legal recreationally)\n  \n  I started when I re-dislocated a sacro-iliac joint in my lower back and was having intense muscle pain, and found that indica strains with a lot of CBD really helped with that. I started experimenting with other strains and found that hybrids containing certain sativa properties, who had a good amount of terpenes, were reallllly helpful for anxiety and staying focused for me, so that's mainly what I smoke nowadays. Much better as-needed panic medication for me than anything else I have in my arsenal, and it's changed my life. I'm able to go out into public more, be social more, attend functions and conventions, travel, all things that I was too anxious to do much of before.

I was the person convincing the teacher I had period cramps basically every day. Looking back, I see the value of encouraging students to learn team work and that exercise should be an important part of one's day. I don't think it has to be exclusive to those who are other-abled, but at least back in the 80s and 90s it certainly was. I think that if educators are able to create a plan that includes everyone, and expectations come away from the whole meeting the presidential fitness award or doing x amount of push-ups or being the best baseball team in the tri-state or whatever and instead focused more on staying healthy and simple calisthenics and team play, it's valuable.\n  ","169847":"\n  I honestly don't know anything about the educational system in my area or country or whatever, I don't have kids and I'm in my late 30s. From what little I've gleamed from other people bitching on facebook or whatnot is that there doesn't seem to be any room for variation, which seems counter-intuitive to learning imo. The schooling I had was so successful because there was plenty of wiggle room to explore ideas and move from subject to subject organically.\n  ","169848":"\n  Well, I'm trying to teach myself to play the ukulele, so that. If I have to pick traditional school subjects, I never took a lot of science or geography classes because my schedule was strictly core credits + art school, so it would be nice to get a chance to learn some of what I missed. Also, language. I was unfortunate in that I was assigned a Spanish 2 and Spanish 3 teacher that I absolutely LOATHED in high school and I didn't retain nearly as much as I would have liked because of it. I grew up listening to Spanish and Portuguese-speaking radio broadcasts with my grandfather so I can understand a lot of it but I can't speak any other languages and I definitely wish I could.\n  ","169849":"\n  I had a series of testers come pull me out of classes as a child to run state and national tests on me- this was like, 1st through 3rd grade.  I don't have my transcripts from the time but I was in the top 1% so that would put my IQ somewhere above 145. From there I was placed in a specialty gifted school, but I transferred out of the academic program in 4th grade to pursue visual art instead (and continued that for the remainder of my school years)\n  ","169850":"\n  hrm- I thought this was a question about how to express love but when I went to answer it it changed to most embarrassing moment, so I guess I'll answer both.\n  \n  1. by being emotionally present and genuine and caring\n  \n  2. I ate something that was spoiled and didn't realize it when I was like, 19- so nearly 20 years ago- but anyway I go to the laundry mat that's like, 4 city blocks away and feel okay doing the laundry and then suddenly DO NOT feel okay and run to the bathroom.... which is locked and out of service. So I decide well, gotta just very carefully and swiftly walk home. This guy I kinda knew stopped to chat about something, small talk, I dunno, I'm trying to be polite but my face is red and I'm sweating and bouncing from one foot to another and this guy just won't stop talking or realize what's happening, just jabbers away and- disaster. I was wearing a very long, very thick velvet skirt and tights, so he still didn't have any clue and KEPT TALKING so finally I just started running, crying, got home, cleaned everything up, and had to walk back shamefully to finish the laundry.\n  ","169851":"\n  Revenge is fueled by anger, pain, envy- it requires the \"wronged\" party to mete out the justice rather than leaving it to a non-passionate third party or \"fate\" or whatever else. Justice steps back and allows the systems in place to work, or at least works towards making sure that those systems work better. It's the fairer, more logical of the two.\n  ","169852":"\n  I wouldn't say \"weak\", as embracing your faults can be quite healthy in some ways- but if your \"inner demons\" include harming others or being uncaring or not ever improving on yourself, then you're probably just doing more damage to yourself and those around you than good. I suppose as with most things, there's a grey area here to consider.\n  ","169853":"\n  Can someone please explain to me why ask is promoting disgusting ableist slurs AGAIN? This girl's probably going to get an inbox full for it, I'd feel sorry for her except for I really just don't.\n  ","169854":"\n  lol nothing that ever saw the rest of the world. My former partner and I had several we were working on over the past 3 years, I'd been attending conferences and making contacts for the past 2 years, we were at a point on our main endeavor where all of the concept work was finished and animations were starting and we were ready to start making videos and blogging and release information and then he was diagnosed with BPD, spiraled out of control, split me off, and destroyed our mutual file share accounts. We had signed several legal documents in the beginning of this mess, and I'm prevented from re-using any of the art I did from his concepts.\n  \n  Anyway all of this came after over a year of constant medical nightmares for me and personal tragedy for him already and the culminating blow-up destroyed me in a lot of ways and now game development is kind of a trigger for me. It's been really important to my therapist that I focus on creating just for myself for the next while, doing simple artistic\/creative things for the joy of it without pressure because with everything that's happened to me and around me in the past 2 years I started basically just falling apart.\n  \n  If I am ever well again, and choose to work on a game, it will likely be solo. I'll just learn to code or whatever and simplify my ideas. I have some basic knowledge of it. I literally put hundreds of hours of my life into projects that are now never going to come to fruition and I don't think I'll ever be able to take that risk- involving someone else-  with a creative endeavor again, art is too much a part of my actual self identity.\n  \n  On the plus side, I don't ever have to attend PAX again.\n  ","169855":"\n  Okay, from now on if I get any repeat questions from people about the following topics, I am instantly just reporting. This EXACT fucking scenario has been presented to me- in the same fucking exact words- either by one individual or multiple anons, and it's ridiculous.

Fuck right off.\n  ","169856":"\n  I like to think that the arguments I get very passionate during are about fairly important things. When people bring silly, childish, pointless shit to me, I might get angry but I'm not really going to fight back or fight for that person or that relationship in any way.\n  \n  For instance, recently a close friend of mine didn't like that I had an opposing view to an article about a woman's response to gendered harassment and he chose to have a total fit and delete me from all of our social networks and then sub-tweet me, attacking my past relationships and me in ways that were just beyond infantile.  I didn't get passionate about it. I mean, okay, I said some angry shit but the main take-away was \"welp, that was fucking pointless\" and I have no regrets or grief over that loss.\n  \n  Fights I've gotten reaaallllly passionate about it's only been because the fight wasn't so ridiculous that it made me stop respecting someone. When I still care, when I still value someone, I'll fight for that relationship. I terribly miss a friend of mine who ended our relationship several months ago, and I would fight for him over and over again if I could.  For now, though, I need healing.\n  ","169857":"\n  Hrmmmm- well, I guess for starters, I use prescribed medications to alter the way my body processes a ton of things- I smoke to control my reactions to side effects from those as well as to ease chronic pain- I keep my mouth shut when I want to scream at people, or else rant and erase, so that's some control over my temper- I listen closely to what my body is telling me so that I can use it's signals to control what I need to start or stop or whatever (for instance, feel full -> stop eating) - I exercise control by making choices, whether it's small like whether or not to smile at a stranger or major like choosing to sign an apartment lease or whatever each decision is a means of taking control over some facet of my life- we have lots of control over a lot of things. Sometimes when I feel out of control it helps to remember that.\n  ","169858":"\n  I've never purposefully been a part of this sort of relationship dynamic.\n  \n  From the outside, maybe because it's easy to confuse dominant with oppressive.\n  ","169859":"\n  Sneeze glitter. It would be annoying for everything to be covered in glitter during allergy season, but I can't imagine it would be even a small fraction of the annoyance of coughing up sputum-covered wet-paper confetti.\n  ","169860":"\n  I mean, I guess every situation and relationship is different, so the dynamic could be harder or more equal or whatever for other people but in my experience, with the amount of mental illness diagnoses I have, and the amount which I'm disabled, I find it pretty hard to believe that anyone close to me could possibly think they suffer more from my illnesses than I do.  I've suffered a lot as a friend or family member to others who are mentally ill, any friend or family member of someone who is mentally ill does, but not even a fraction of the suffering I've survived from my own illnesses.\n  ","169861":"\n  this is Rin and Kyo. they have a little sister, Mimi, not shown.\n  ","169862":"\n  If the habits are similar, then not that long I wouldn't think.

This term was coined not even that long ago as a means of addressing draining relationships, but each relationship is different and the term is so broad and emotionally charged that I really just hate it. One can learn to behave differently. One can be more aware of how they affect others. Vampires are fiction and emotional vampire is some other abusive term to throw around on the internet.\n  ","169864":"\n  Maybe- regardless of what they prefer though, self-diagnosis is dangerous and any medical issue be it psychological or physical needs to be addressed by a professional when possible.\n  ","169865":"\n  Beta blockers and Latuda.

The side effects are horrible but I am crossing my fingers that they'll go away soon.\n  ","169866":"\n  my favorite cuisines lately are probably Lebanese, Portuguese, Indian, and Creole but honestly I also really like a bacon cheeseburger a whole effin' lot.\n  ","169867":"\n  Harold and Maude\n  ","169868":"\n  lol did you make this account specifically just to troll feminists?\n  ","169869":"\n  I had a jawa toy with glowing eyes and I cannot find anything even sort of like it anywhere, I'm almost convinced I imagined it.\n  ","169870":"\n  We get a lot of light rain and mild temps here in the PNW, which means gnats are an issue. I've found that putting an open jar somewhere in a room with a lot of gnats with an inch or two of plain white vinegar and one squirt of Dawn dish soap gets rid of them quickly.\n  \n  They are attracted to the vinegar to drink- and normally, can land on the surface and then fly away- but the Dawn changes the surface tension, so when they land, they sink under the surface and drown- and the vinegar breaks down their bodies so you don't even have to see a bunch of corpses, just sort of a weird sludge in the bottom.\n  \n  Anyway, yeah. I feel like I should have thought of something better than this but seriously, gnats are annoying and this is a quick and cheap solution.\n  ","169871":"\n  it's possible they have mixed up their realities. It's possible that they are just so panicked about defending themselves that they're committed to it. I dunno. I try not to lie about shit.\n  ","169872":"\n  Well I can be a bit of a music snob so I think sometimes people are grossed out by my love of Lady Gaga but really, they can fuck off because she's amazing.\n  \n  I like cookies a lot and I really need to stop\n  \n  eh I dunno. There are tons of things I enjoy but none of them are \"guilty\" pleasures really, I just like what I like.\n  ","169873":"\n  So hi y'all remember that time one of the people I trusted as a close friend freaked out because I didn't agree that pestering women repeatedly for phone numbers after being turned down and given definite negative signals wasn't gross? The guy who also had a crybaby fit because he thinks he's above being problematic despite being a white male in his 40s because he's such a great guy? Well anyway, fuck that shit. Also, he split me off during a crisis time for me, literally during the most difficult and panic-filled time of my adult life so far. So like, I'm on new meds and I'm facing chronic panic disorder instead of generalized anxiety disorder and my health is top priority and if you bring that piece of shit to my attention or plaster it on my wall I'm probably going to have to unfollow you. Just putting that warning out there, I haven't seen it yet but I'm in a really bad spot and I thought about that shit and I'm so disgusted I had to say something.\n  ","169874":"\n  Sure. I guess one could say that people manipulate people constantly without knowing it or meaning to in some cases. Like, say I'm really sad and I want someone to talk to, my gut reaction might be to reach out to a friend and ask how they're doing. It's not a BAD sort of manipulation, but it's an action I took that eventually meets my own needs even if it's harmless enough.\n  ","169875":"\n  mustard, and variations of mustard such as honey mustard or a mustard aioli or whatever. My LEAST favorite condiment is ketchup and even the smell of it grosses me out lol.\n  ","169876":"\n  gah I don't know I have so many dumb pieces of costume jewelry that I'm overly attached too\n  ","169877":"\n  I had a recurring dream all through childhood until probably college age where I was at the base of Jabba the Hut, but he was bigger... several stories taller. I feel so small in the dream, but I am supposed to feel important. He is telling me something crucial, it's of utmost importance that I listen and follow orders precisely or he will kill me and destroy everything. I cant understand his language. His voice booms and I can't decipher anything. I spiral mentally into myself, feeling smaller and smaller. (then wake up screaming)\n  \n  I still have recurring dreams\/night terrors, but they no longer involve Jabba the Hut :P  Now, I have this town I've constructed slowly, centering around a mall, a school, and an apartment high rise. Often the dreams are standard anxiety dreams where I'm late for something or I have to complete some sort of trial in order to be able to do something important or whatever but occasionally, they go WAY dark and I'm being chased by men in suits who intend to take me underneath the mall to a secret government laboratory so I can be tested on.\n  ","169878":"\n  Nahhhhh no worries. I'm old, shit goes wrong. All has been biopsied in the past 2 years and we're Cat. 2 (\"probably benign\") everywhere still. Just a pain in the tits for me is all lol.\n  ","169879":"\n  haha I don't sit around and try these things, these fuckers are full of painful cysts and tumors so I mean- I know how a mammogram machine or the MRI machine fit on there but past that...\n  ","169880":"\n  I'm an animal person.

I'm not much of a destroyer. I'm a reactor, and a fighter, but not a destroyer.\n  ","169882":"\n  Yeah, I suppose I agree mostly. Someone in a really great mood can lift my mood up, and vice versa.\n  ","169883":"\n  basically. my bras are NOT pretty.\n  ","169884":"\n  This is actually some old wive's tale or something- the bra store I go to here in Portland is called \"The Pencil Test\" because apparently there was some old saying for adolescent girls trying to determine if they were old enough for a bra yet that if you could hold a pencil under your breast with no hands then it was time for a bra. I have H cups I could probably hold a box of pencils under there :P\n  ","169885":"\n  I've been thinking about this or something like it more or less off and on since Eternal Sunshine came out, tbh, but at the end of the day I think I want all of the bad as a reminder of challenges completed and trials survived. I have memory issues related to cptsd as it stands, I hate those areas where I'm not sure what happened. I'd rather have what's mine.\n  ","169886":"\n  lol thanks :) The first two dates were alright, for the record. Meanwhile, he lived very close to me so every time I saw him out with other women after that I always made a point to look at their shoes haha.\n  ","169887":"\n  I had gone out with this guy twice, so it was third date time. He was cooking dinner at his place. I get there, first time in his apartment. Everything is like, fluorescent purple. Walls, furniture, etc. The Miss Universe competition was being aired, and he insisted we watch it with 3D glasses on with the sound muted and Bjork playing instead. I was semi okay with this, whatever, I was an art school kid so it wasn't thaaaat strange- but then right after dinner he takes a long hard look at my feet and tells me he needs to take me shoe shopping because my shoes weren't sexually gratifying for him. I noped out. Can't even remember his name now.\n  ","169888":"\n  Today I was blocked and deleted by one of you, and I'd just like to say in defense of myself- since I was so FUCKING rudely denied that- that I won't take white cis hetero male shit from ANYONE I don't care how special you think you are. Don't be gross, and you won't be treated like you're being gross. PS the whole \"I'm such a sad lonely white guy who uses social issues to try to get women and oh I'm so dark and mysterious and look at me with my all black avatar and my darkness name\" shit is SO so so childish and laughable. Like, grow the fuck up.\n  ","169889":"\n  thank you :)\n  ","169890":"\n  I'm having a hard time making sense of this question, which I'm sure is mostly my fault because fever. At any rate, I am the queen of holding on to love too long so I'm probably the worst person to ask.\n  ","169891":"\n  I learned a few days ago that a sea otter has over a million hairs growing per one inch of surface area.\n  ","169892":"\n  the dead don't care.

I don't know why.\n  ","169896":"\n  If I have, it was so long ago I can't remember. I've never really been around many kung-fu-movie fans, and haven't really had much interest on my own. Maybe I'll check it out one day just to do so.\n  ","169897":"\n  Some \"problematic\" favorite franchises of mine have had a redemption recently, so I have no issue with loving the old knowing that the new makes the changes necessary to show that the times have changed (Mad Max, Star Wars).  Otherwise, I try to remember that a lot of the things I love that are problematic are also really old, so there's a certain amount of excusing I do for that I think. James Bond, however, is and always has been a franchise built on womanizing and being \"alpha white male\" so I'm not exactly in love with that mess. It's boring.\n  ","169898":"\n  I usually assume people tell the truth about things, at least for the most part? I don't know. I feel like a lot of you are just looking for the worst in people constantly. I don't operate like that. Unless something is blatantly throwing red flags I tend to trust.\n  ","169899":"\n  fuckin'\n  \n  motherfucking\n  \n  like\n  \n  just\n  \n  so...\n  \n  anyway\n  \n  goddamnit\n  ","169900":"\n  lol but it makes me sad I don't want Mokey to eat spelunker ladies\n  ","169901":"\n  I don't really have a good answer for this because my brain keeps reading it and immediately thinking \"What if the monsters in the movie Descent were Fraggles\" and that's awful and I don't want it to be my answer but here it is being my answer anyway\n  ","169902":"\n  god I hope so\n  ","169903":"\n  Somewhere that gives the opportunity for talking and getting to know one another without being too secluded for the comfort for both involved just in case things get hinky, so I dunno.

Since they tried wings here and basically ruined the chicken wing economy I think they've been sort of unsure about what to do with chicken haha.\n  ","169907":"\n  we do not and now I'm sad.

Most women do have some sort of ejaculate from the skene's gland during orgasm, but for me it's always been more of an \"extra lubricant\" situation, not a squirting situation.\n  ","169911":"\n  I've only seen a couple of episodes, and that was way back in the day.\n  ","169912":"\n  Not really, sorry.\n  ","169913":"\n  this is gross but when I'm really sick or sad but still have an appetite I want McDonald's cheeseburgers. Not the fancy ones, just the little plain single cheeseburgers. Maybe they remind me of visiting my grandma when I was a kid or something. Other comfort foods include tater tots, grilled cheese, and tomato soup.\n  ","169914":"\n  Pancakes. someone please bring me some right now.\n  ","169915":"\n  owls and cats and omg I went to some sea lion caves today and they are smelly and loud but that was one of the coolest things I've ever experienced\n  ","169916":"\n  I have never played any metal gear solid games so I'm not sure what the dealio is. I'm not the biggest fan of penises lately.\n  ","169917":"\n  I've been out of town for the past two days and hadn't paid much attention until now.

Also, I don't drink.\n  ","169924":"\n  I've turned down so many little honors here and there throughout my early teens and twenties because of \"fighting the system\" in some nonsense way or another, including refusing my Mensa acceptance. I regret all of it. Always take the honors, no one really cares anyway and as you get older it's nice to have mementos about your accomplishments.\n  ","169925":"\n  I don't, sorry\n  ","169926":"\n  yes :(\n  ","169927":"\n  I honestly don't know. It seemed like a good way to process thoughts other than the ones that haunt and instead it's become a source of anger and anxiety.\n  ","169928":"\n  This question is meh, just like all you kids using ableist terms like \"cr*zy\" and \"ins*ne\" all the fucking time. How about stop being offensive little shitheads, some of us actually are diagnosed with a lot of mental illnesses and aren't pretending on the internet for attention. Those words are offensive. Hurtful. Triggering.\n  ","169929":"\n  To settle is to be content with ignorance. I try to learn\/ask questions as much as I'm able.\n  ","169930":"\n  Today is the best day ever, for real. Thank you so much, Leigh your kind words were a major blessing this weekend. I think you're pretty awesome, too! Not only for being the first other INFJ I'd known besides me (though now I know Marty's one too) but also for being wise and mature beyond your years and beautiful inside and out.\n  ","169931":"\n  I dunno about athletes but I can tell you who my favorite mathlete is....Millie Kentner\n  ","169932":"\n  I'm afraid my eyesight will be first to go because of some medical issues, but I'd much rather it be my sense of smell. I smoked cigarettes for 15 years off and on- mostly on- quit the first time for a year-ish but couldn't handle the SMELLS of everything and started again to make them less offensive. I did quit again for good 5 and a half years ago though. I apparently have an incredibly sensitive sniffer and smoking cigs dulled it enough that it was \"normal\". I'd rather be overwhelmed by smells than give myself lung cancer though, so meh.\n  ","169933":"\n  I'm having a rough morning as well, but I get to live with these cuties so that's alright. hope things improve for you!\n  ","169934":"\n  Nope. There is no logical reason for it, but I can't do wearable tech, I short it out. I've gone literally through 7 first-gen fitbits, 2 off-brand heart monitors, and 12 fitbit flexs. I wore all of those either on my wrist or clipped to the center of my bra, I can't imagine what would short out if it were actually in the belly of the beast, so to say. I'd be worried about something causing me harm because of malfunction, and I wouldn't expect it would work well anyway.\n  ","169935":"\n  lol awesome! thanks <3\n  ","169936":"\n  I'm not a fan of Tolkien, and while I know I saw the movies at Jon's insistence, I can't remember a single character name right now except Gandolf....so him.\n  ","169937":"\n  I'm schizophrenic. During episodes- which are thankfully very infrequent (though I've been having one since November, it is the first major episode since 2002 so in a way I feel pretty happy about that) I often feel concerned about my level of sanity. I can tell the difference between auditory delusions\/visual hallucinations and reality easily, and once I take my meds and give a bit of rational thought to things I can sort through the paranoia- but a new thing this episode for me is \"losing time\" and THAT is really fucking me up.\n  \n  The tipping point into this episode was a breakup with my former best friend and business partner. I was already having an incredibly hard time with my mental health because of some major physical health concerns and cptsd triggers, but that pushed me over the edge into dangerous territory.\n  \n  My first instance of \"lost time\" concerns him, and that situation. A few weeks ago, I noticed the thumb ring I'd been wearing for over a year- it's one I bought in Utah when I last visited my friend and his family. It reminded me of him, and the trip. I looked at the ring, sighed, and went on with my day but I didn't touch or remove it.\n  \n  The next day, my hand felt strange and I soon realized that the ring was gone. I spent several days in huge frantic spurts looking everywhere for this ring. I do not remember ever removing it. I didn't normally remove it for any reason short of MRIs. But now it's gone. Somewhere in that day's worth of time, I removed it, put it somewhere or threw it away, and then immediately blocked all memories of this. I still don't know where it is, and I've since purchased a new thumb ring to hopefully attach new, healing memories too.\n  \n  That shit fucking scares me though.\n  ","169938":"\n  Maybe for some people? I don't feel that's the case with me at all. I'm not afraid of being offended, I'm afraid of giving others the impression that I'm unlovable or unworthy because I feel unlovable and unworthy. Has nothing to do with fear of offense, more fear of abandonment or dislike. I can see why this is a theory, though, especially for those with panic disorders or who are prone to panic attacks, if being offended causes panic then a fear of anything that could cause another attack is pretty normal.\n  ","169939":"\n  I don't think this is the average person's experience but maybe I'm wrong. This seems more like a personality disorder reaction. I'm obviously no expert- in anything- so maybe I'm the oddball here. At any rate, I don't relate to this so I'm not sure. I want to protect the people I desire, and make them happy.\n  ","169940":"\n  I kinda feel like that's always a low-key responsibility of any empathetic and caring human being to some degree. Maybe not to the point of hyper-vigilance or anything, but I feel like it's important to try to be as helpful and understanding as you can when others come to you with their problems on their journeys forward. When possible, at least, obviously everyone has their dark days where they can't be much help to others because they need to help themselves. I feel like we'd all be a bit better off if we gave honest advice and genuine care to each other.\n  ","169941":"\n  Ha yes I saw your answer and my first thought was \"hell yeah I knew it- fuckin' old white dudes\"\n  \n  You're right, liberty and safety shouldn't be mutually exclusive. Both can exist without having to choose whether to live in a state of freedom or security. You broke it down more thoroughly than I did, my thoughts immediately went to situations where staying safe needs to be the first priority and felt the quote was quite judgy against the oppressed and abused.\n  ","169942":"\n  No, I don't. It sounds like it was written or spoken by an old white man who has no idea what being oppressed feels like. The rest of us do what we need to do to survive.\n  ","169943":"\n  I can't separate these and choose. I want to be a comfort to someone who also comforts me.\n  ","169944":"\n  the terms \"sociopath\" and \"psychopath\" have been used interchangeably more or less since the 1800's and both describe basically the same condition but with varying degrees of severity. Nowadays, these terms are more frequently referred to as Antisocial Personality Disorder. I do not have any of the symptoms of this disorder, but I'm certainly not neuro-typical. So none of these things.\n  ","169945":"\n  I cannot imagine a state of existence where I wouldn't feel judged. I have schizophrenia. major depression, OCD, Complex PTSD, and a panic disorder and all of those things add up to enough anxiety that I'm thoroughly amazed with myself for being as in control as I am. I feel judged by nothing. By memories. Strangers. My cats. Whoever. Whatever. (hopefully we'll get some new meds sorted out at the end of the month to help with this a bit)\n  ","169946":"\n  understanding\n  ","169947":"\n  I have no idea what I want or what the future means for me at this time. I keep doing whatever because the alternative is too hard to think about.\n  ","169948":"\n  An old, favorite flannel with paint stains on the sleeves, because I feel like throughout my life that's sort of ended up being the go-to for comfort. They are soft and warm and ageless.\n  ","169949":"\n  Well I don't really watch them anymore but I was a secret big fan of the Flavor of Love \"reality\" dating shows with Flavor Flav back when they were a thing. There weren't any redeeming qualities really other than being a wellspring of memes for Tumblr.\n  ","169950":"\n  Does anyone else using this site in the English language via Chrome suddenly have (I think) Japanese kanji icons? My social media icons, heart, and settings wheel are all kanji but everything else is still in English. If so, how to fix? I've triple-checked that I'm still set to \"English\" in language settings.\n  ","169951":"\n  It was actually a really decent day. I think finally having an appointment lined up with a therapist (I go tomorrow) instead of the seemingly never-ending waiting list took such a big load off of my shoulders. I can't get in to see my psychiatrist again to change my meds until the 22nd still, but at least I can get something going towards positive change soon.\n  \n  I felt well enough that I was able to finish the stack of intake paperwork and call the insurance company and wash my hair and decide to go out to a restaurant for dinner (waiting for my husband to get home from work now).\n  \n  Extra bonuses, chatted with a few wonderful friends which is always good and got a ring I had ordered for myself as an early birthday gift in the mail.\n  ","169952":"\n  Shoulder pads were a nightmare when I was growing up, I'm so glad I've not had to deal with those since and I pray it stays that way. I also hate high heels, pointy toes, peplum waists, I dunno.Basically if you'd wear it to a cocktail party in 1984 I hope it never come back.\n  \n  PS I LOVE legwarmers lol I don't care if they're never in style again I'll still wear 'em.\n  ","169953":"\n  It was hard re-watching Twin Peaks recently, actually. Not because it was bad, because it was actually probably even better than I remembered, but because while it was a very progressive show for it's time there were still some pretty problematic things said here and there that stuck out to me on most recent viewing.\n  ","169954":"\n  cookies or cheesy type snacks like cheez-its or cheetos or doritos or whatnot.\n  ","169955":"\n  Definitely not the main reason, though surely a reason for some I'm sure. I'm too lazy to bother some days, but more often than that I'm not going anywhere so I don't feel like it's necessary, or I'm having a really good skin day so I only wear mascara or whatever. I'm allergic to a ton of stuff as well, so I don't wear much when I do- at least, not on my face. My eyes or lips I'll do up sometimes but I never really have more on my face than a Korean BB Cream (their requirements are stricter and ingredients are much easier on sensitive skin- the US lets all sorts of nasty chemically stuff sit on the market) and some translucent powder because anything more than that will break me out into hives.\n  ","169956":"\n  Thank you <3 I did need a teeny break but I'm feeling a little better tonight. I had a bit of a break last night and this morning and it ended up being bad enough that I was able to convince the behavioral health place I'm supposed to see a therapist at to get me an emergency appointment Thurs evening so I'm relieved to finally be able to get started with that.\n  ","169957":"\n  Well, the \"five stages of grief\" (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance) seem to be the way I normally go, except maybe with anger and depression being a low-key constant throughout the process. I need to have time to go through all of the stages at my own pace.\n  ","169958":"\n  Went and saw Tei Shi at the Doug Fir in Portland last Fall, she was amazing.\n  ","169959":"\n  You motherfuckers win, I guess. I'm too unstable right now. No more anons. I've reported, blocked, and deleted a lot more than I can fucking handle today.\n  \n  I wish I knew who hated me so much that they would literally put my life in danger like this. I'm having psychotic episodes. I'm unable to see my psychiatrist until the 22nd and there is an up to 3 month waiting list right now to see the new therapist my insurance company wants me to see. I am not functioning well, and in order to maintain at least some functionality I have to remain heavily medicated on meds that only cover some of my symptoms.\n  \n  E, that you? You want me dead now? Already took my work and my hopes and the only support I had, gotta take my life too?\n  \n  If not, then who the fuck? What kind of twisted little shit is after me right now? Is it one or many? I've blocked 4 different anons the past few days.\n  \n  Watch a grown woman melt the fuck down. Know that my hands are shaking violently. Know that my heartbeat is elevated and that my right arm is going numb. My back is spasming. This is what harassment does to someone having a psychotic episode. This is what happens when you keep poking someone with a panic disorder.\n  \n  I don't even hate you. I fucking pity you that you find humor or pleasure in this. What sort of sad, awful existence is that. I'm barely surviving but I'd rather be me than you.\n  ","169960":"\n  I used to really like to paint. I haven't done it in a while, though. I'm not sure why. I want to- I'll get all set up to and then just don't. I've got a lot of shit to work through, hopefully I can speed through this waiting list for the therapist I want to see. (I do still do art, mostly via an iPad but what I really want to do is encaustic paintings and I just feel so petrified about it for some reason)\n  ","169961":"\n  I actually usually do go on weekday mornings if I decide to see something, which does help with the crowds. It definitely doesn't help with the little ones acting up, since around here apparently bringing a 6 month old, a 2 year old, and a 6 year old to an R rated movie is the norm and I've yet to see any movie in this town where there wasn't at least one mom with several inappropriately-aged kids going wild. I've never liked theaters. I keep making exceptions because I want to see things, and then regretting the decision. I'm just done with the whole experience. There's no benefit for me to watch a movie that I already think is way too loud- when the large screen gives me a headache- that I can't get comfortable in because of dirt and distractions- and that I can't pause when I have to pee. Thanks for trying to help though, I know people reallllly love the theater experience but I just do not.\n  ","169962":"\n  Last Thursday night I went to see The Force Awakens, which was amazing. What wasn't amazing was the screaming infant, the talking yuppies, the toddler kicking my back for over an hour, the gross floors, the bad smells... I'm over movie theaters. I may go to one of those \"living room\" style ones, but I am too mentally ill to deal with that much distraction and nonsense when I'm trying to enjoy myself.\n  ","169963":"\n  I guess I'd react first by getting my butt to an urgent care to have it properly removed (don't want any extra wiggly bits left in there accidentally)\n  ","169964":"\n  I regret not blocking more shitty anons.\n  ","169965":"\n  I'm not sure what being disabled has to do with feminism but you can fuck right off anyway.\n  ","169966":"\n  My first celebrity crushes were Tina Turner and David Bowie. My first actual other kid crush was this little boy in my kindergarten class named Corey who had a ton of freckles and bright orange hair. Corey was also good at coloring and we were best buds. I was invited on a play date, and we went to a park near a tennis court so his yuppie mom could play tennis while we played on the playground (this was the 80s, people just left little kids to do shit all the time). I ended up having to use the bathroom and I went and got Corey's mom expecting her to put us in the van and take me to a proper potty but instead she made me huddle behind the van and pee in a jug while she held up a blanket and I was so mortified that I stopped liking Corey because I was afraid I'd have to go on another play date.\n  ","169967":"\n  I finished my first mandala from the coloring book I received for Xmas just before midnight on New Year's Eve. My hands shake and tremor because of various reasons, so it's not perfect but it was nice to put energy into something on paper without any stress or pressure.\n  ","169968":"\n  He kept trying to get into my lap by sneaking up behind me and putting his claws in my elbow so that I'd look at him and invite him up, but when I did, he wouldn't settle in and instead chose to try to knock everything off my desk before turning his attention to pawing at my face\/chin. It's a cute kind of annoying.\n  ","169969":"\n  why the fuck are you bothering me still.\n  \n  I'm nearly 36.\n  \n  I have no interest in your bullshit.\n  \n  There's nothing wrong with a fetish. There is something wrong with coming at someone anonymously with shitty questions and then having a fit over their answers if they don't go the way you hoped. You have no right to continue to bother me after I asked you not to. You are invading my personal boundaries. You are being, in short, an annoying little shit. I'm blocking you now.\n  ","169970":"\n  Hey everyone, look! Another fucking internet asshole who thinks that because he rolled up in here without consent and pestered me over and over about a thing anonymously, I'm comparing his fetish to AIDS. I assume he'll call me Hitler next.\n  ","169971":"\n  okay- 3 questions about feet massages, on a site that literally every fucking user here knows is filled with foot fetishists without any social boundaries.\n  \n  all involving children and a women\/older girl in a dominant position?\n  \n  How about, just don't ask me questions?\n  ","169972":"\n  \"Making\" someone do something is wrong, sure. If it's a silly thing like- an agreement was made or a bet was had and it resulted in foot massages, then shrug. I mean, are guns being held to heads? Are these younger sisters and brothers being blackmailed with information that is going to ruin their adult lives? At the base of it there is a consent issue, no one should be made to do something they are against. But really. This seems like a family thing that probably has more to the story than \"Susie made Tommy and Alice rub her feet against their wills\".\n  ","169973":"\n  I mean, I was the oldest, and I was a brat to my younger sister and brother too sometimes I'm sure- but I didn't  have the luxury of fucking around and making people massage my feet, I was too busy trying to make sure we survived an abusive mother. Like, if this is your biggest concern, then maybe you should just be thankful.\n  \n  But since this is probably just the lead in to another stream of anon foot fetish questions, I'm not sure why I bothered answering anyway.\n  ","169974":"\n  Any variation of \"fuck\".

So I'd have a pile of treats for him and a few smaller piles for his guests (his sisters, Rin and Mimi), and on either side of his pile would also be a plate with a dollop of yogurt and a bowl with fake cheese dust sprinkled generously (the other two cats don't care about those things).\n  \n  We would play chase the laser, try to get the dangly thing out of mom's hands, and roll around in catnip and run fast.

I'll watch a Christmas movie or two this week I'm sure out of obligation- and my husband realllllly wants to go see Star Wars again and take me with him (I didn't go on opening night because of crowds). The last movie I watched was a week or two ago, a New Zealand horror movie called Housebound and it was AMAZING. Also, it definitely cured my recent aversion to special effects gore, so I can maybe try to watch the new Ash and the Evil Dead show with my husband one of these days (previously-recently- I'd been unable to see gore or violence even in entertainment without getting really upset, I've had some major ptsd things happening)\n  ","170020":"\n  When I was a kid in Virginia, a couple of the neighborhood boys got together each December and climbed trees to harvest mistletoe to sell outside of the grocery store for Xmas money, so we always had a little sprig somewhere though I never thought much of it.\n  \n  Now on the other side of the country, I haven't seen any mistletoe and certainly no one has had any to sell me,so I haven't really thought about it at all until you brought it up\n  \n  So I guess the point is I've nothing against it, I just sort of forget it exists as a thing\n  ","170021":"\n  Ursula.

It was alright. The bud quality was extremely good, as is usual from Top Cut (out of Tacoma, WA). It's not my favorite strain but it's a good \"workhorse\" strain for me medicine-wise. It works fast on anxiety and helps me narrow down my train of thought so I can get things done around the house and work on projects. Has a piney taste\/smell to it. High is pretty low-key but it does it's job. Not great for pain, but good enough that I can usually avoid having to take Tylenol or whatever for headaches\/cramps\/backaches. 8\/10 would recommend to a friend.\n  ","170028":"\n  If circuses were taking the same steps as many modern zoos are and working towards a more educational approach that included animals who were being rehabilitated or can't be released into the wild for whatever reasons, then they would be okay.\n  \n  Sadly, at least from what little I'm aware of, most are not.\n  \n  There's nothing wrong with rescuing an animal from a situation that it wouldn't survive in to train it to be a teaching tool for the goal of future conservation and protection of others like it. For instance, the Audubon society near me has an albino barred owl who was rejected by it's mother and would not have made it with it's non-camouflaged coloring.

If that. lol.\n  ","170032":"\n  I'd be a Grey\n  ","170033":"\n  Most of my traditions for the holiday season occur well before the actual holidays.

On Xmas itself, we generally just go eat at a Chinese buffet and call our families.\n  ","170034":"\n  Forgiveness is a big part of loving and respecting someone, I think. However, not everyone's actions are deserving of respect and not everyone is deserving of forgiveness.  I will never be able to forgive my rapist.

I'd seen it before and have seen it since in print, without the same feeling, but standing there in front of it, something about it really grabbed my guts and squeezed. I'd steal it, so I could see it everyday.\n  ","170041":"\n  I don't really have a favorite. I always like to buy flowers in the Summer when my neighborhood farmer's market is going- there is a elderly woman from Portland area who sells bouquets of whatever is in bloom from her (I presume very large) gardens named Mary Cho, and they are always bright, large, varied, and smell amazing. When her grand-kids can help her prepare bouquets, she does a $5 size and a $10 size, so I always buy when she has the $5 available and once in a great while will get a larger one if I have company coming or something.\n  ","170042":"\n  A really awesome owl type creature to be my sidekick\n  ","170043":"\n  I'd commission a Game of Thrones themed tarot deck because you like that show and do tarot.\n  ","170044":"\n  prosthetic foreheads on their real heads\n  ","170045":"\n  Yes!

I like Christmas movies because they are things that my dad and I are both really excited about so it's a bonding thing, maybe? I dunno. My dad wasn't around a ton as a kid because my parents were divorced when I was 3 and my mother limited visitation pretty strictly because she's a Borderline Narcissist so good memories from my childhood with my father are few and far between but not in a way that's anyone but my mother's fault, if that makes sense.\n  ","170048":"\n  In my early 20s I used to pick up after work on Friday and drive 6 hours or so to Atlantic City and just play blackjack and get drunk for hours- sober up- and drive home sometime the next day.

I guess it was just a way to get completely out of myself for a bit.\n  ","170049":"\n  Aliens are more likely because there are infinite planets circling infinite stars so who knows what else is thriving out there... but some of those aliens could be squatch, then, so they're both more likely to exist.

If it's a horror and it's the worst movie ever, then I might still want to watch it if it's bad because of terrible gore effects or being especially surreal or something. Most other genres, I'd probably avoid.\n  ","170051":"\n  Yes, I consider joining cults all the time- I just never decide that it's a good idea to join. The last cult that caught my attention was one started by a band called Yacht. It's actually quite interesting.\n  ","170052":"\n  I have memory blackouts- and one is during a time in college where the only clear memory I have is running across the street to talk to my art history professor and getting into his car. So who knows, I may have dated a professor and just don't remember because trauma.\n  \n  I don't know- as far as the question. I mean, it happens. It always seems gross unless you're one of the people involved, right? I don't really have an opinion.\n  \n  I don't have the emotional reserve to come up with opinions or answers for a lot of these serious topics lately, they just sort of bring me down and raise my anxiety levels.

I have no OTP. I was going to say that maybe this is a millennial thing, but I'm sure people have been hoping for fictional characters to hook up before now, we just didn't have words for it. Maybe it's just that I'm so over romantic relationships being a plot or sub plot that I don't want ANYONE to get shipped, it's so much more refreshing to me to see characters in fictional worlds do things that aren't motivated by love and relationships.\n  ","170061":"\n  Yes. It requires a ton of money, meds, effort, and care to maintain me in my current state.\n  ","170062":"\n  Well I'm fat, so definitely not middle. No one enjoys that. I like the window on short flights and the aisle on long flights.\n  ","170063":"\n  I don't think I'm very patriotic, but I don't hate my country. I don't like the way we do things sometimes, and I don't like how our culture and ignorance looks to the rest of the world, but shrug. Things I love about the US include the National Parks and all of the different and beautiful wild parts of the country- uh- I like some of the people here- I feel safe from war or attacks of that nature, and with the exception of when I lived in an area with a high concentration of navy bases, I always have, so that's probably something I should be thankful for- I dunno. It's not so bad.\n  ","170064":"\n  I like egg drop soup also occasionally, I used to make it but I don't remember what recipe I was using. Anyway- buffet- the one we usually go to makes a really good yellow curry, crab rangoon, and a fried shrimp sushi roll with spicy sauce and I don't remember what else that's their house roll. Those three things I almost always get at that specific place, but if we're talking just in-general sorts of buffets I probably will go for things like chicken with cashew nuts, fried rice, anything with mushrooms, beef and broccoli just to get some greens, and of course an almond cookie for dessert.\n  ","170065":"\n  Only the same lies everyone else tells on those \"personality\" questionnaires with questions like \"Gerald's family is really having a hard time lately, with a sick relative.

If it's like- someone lied about being unable to perform a specific physical task in a job that requires it, and then worsens a pre-existing condition or whatever, then yeah, it's just that person's fault, but when it comes to something like, I dunno- a brain surgeon lies about having the proper schooling and then patients die, then that's also on the hospital that hired him without checking credentials.\n  ","170066":"\n  I show everyone respect the same way- by being as kind and genuine as I am able to be.

Whisper for sure.\n  ","170068":"\n  I don't really know. I don't have any religious attachment to it at all, and I don't care about gifts or Christmas dinner or any of that. I really enjoy seeing the bright lights and decorations, I like the carols, I LOVE decorating the tree- I have pretty good childhood memories from Xmas if nothing else, because hardly anyone is a total asshole at Christmas- at least, not in my family which is super surprising. Maybe that's it- maybe I love the time of year leading up to Xmas so much because it was the only time I have good, normal, happy memories from being a kid.\n  ","170069":"\n  <3 thank you, and yes ofc\n  ","170070":"\n  I guess I ask weird questions and not everyone looooooves that, so if you get questions from me and hate them, just let me know. I have literally no method to who I send shit out to, I just sort of pick people who are around and have shown up in my feed or notifications a lot.\n  \n  I ask the questions I ask because I'm MUCH moire interested in how your brain works in creative situations than what you ate for lunch or whether or not you get mad at the same politics I do. Opinions change, but problem solving imo is a clearer look into who you are.\n  \n  Or, sometimes I just ask shit 'cause I'm high af and I think of something silly.\n  \n  Either way, if you hate that, just stop answering, or let me know, or whatever. Shrug.\n  ","170071":"\n  I would love a average sized house (like, 3 br\/ 2.5 bath or whatever) that sits in a clearing at the end of a longish, curving driveway through the woods. I'd have an acre or two where I grew various herbs and flowers to distill into oils, as well as 2-3 bee hives. I'd learn to make soap, and have a work shed with big sinks and counters.\n  \n  For the living part of the house, I think I lean more towards the \"whatever, that's cute, put it there\" school of decorating nowadays though in the past I was much more particular about color themes and shit. I want bright colors and kitsch and cat-friendly and comfort. I have a ton of art that I've either done or purchased everywhere now, so that would still be the case.\n  \n  I'd have lots of natural sunlight, and a cozy patio in the back with a fire pit. It would probably be here in Washington, somewhere surrounded by trees with a view of a snow-capped mountain. It would be out of town a bit, but not far enough to not have city water\/sewage and good internet.\n  ","170072":"\n  Sure, it's definitely important. Especially intimacy. I can't see a relationship working for very long without the trust and openness that comes from being intimate with someone, even if sex isn't a part of that equation. As far as sex goes, it's a need we all have- though some more than others.\n  \n  Experience is so not important. Not stressing out and being honest and genuine are what make sex more enjoyable, not time-tested moves.\n  ","170073":"\n  Cinnamon, peppermint, cloved orange, cider, a baking Virginia ham, bloody mary mix. My paternal grandfather's girlfriend (after my grandmother passed), Miss Essie as we called her, always has a big Christmas party on Christmas Eve that lasts all day long, and cooks a ham and everyone brings a little something and gets drunk. There was often hot cider or some sort of kid-safe spiced hot drink for us as well. Her house was always decorated for Christmas year-round, which is something my grandmother started when my dad was a kid and all of their close friends picked up in her honor. It's one of the reasons I love Xmas trees so much, as everyone on my dad's side growing up (except for my dad, but he does go all out at actual Xmas time) had their tree up all year and just changed out decorations. Anyway, a lot of her decorating included those cinnamon brooms and pine cones, so her little house had a lot of cinnamon and food smells. Those were good times, I am sad I didn't keep in better touch with that group.\n  ","170074":"\n  Chinese food buffet, and yeah probably lol.\n  ","170075":"\n  The man is to blame, he is the person who made a commitment to someone else, not the woman. If it were MY relationship, I would probably have some questions but overall would be pretty okay. I have a hard time agreeing with the whole concept of marriage meaning ownership of my sexuality, and honestly feel like I'd do better in a poly relationship, but my husband isn't comfortable with that at this time. If he were to find someone else, I'd be overall glad that he realized that someone else might meet some of his needs better than I can, and that that's alright with me.\n  ","170076":"\n  End, begin, all the same. Big change. Sometimes good. Sometimes bad.\n  ","170077":"\n  I hate being wrong and will fight it until everyone hates my guts. Debate feels like attacks, and I panic and defend. I have weird triggers and childhood ptsd. I'm working on it- admitting when I'm wrong- I think I'm getting better at it.\n  ","170078":"\n  I've been thinking about this a lot lately because I have a ton of essential oils I purchased for my diffuser and I love experimenting with different combinations.\n  \n  It would definitely have a frankincense base, with some spicy layers, maybe peppermint, clove, and ginger. The top note would be jasmine, with maybe a teeeny tiny bit of tangerine.\n  \n  The bottle would be glass, with a sturdy base that cats can't knock over. A gradient of dark orange to yellow from bottom to top maybe? Spray bottle. Reasonably priced but only sold in specific boutiques.\n  ","170079":"\n  I think I use intellect and instinct together more than either one separately.\n  ","170080":"\n  It doesn't matter, not even a little bit. I've dated both people with large amounts of previous partners and no previous partners at all. Sex is sex. It's really weird to me how our society treats it, it's a natural part of life not a magical ritual.\n  ","170081":"\n  I mean, I'm a pretty good cook. I make whatever. I'm best at cooking meats, soups, stews, roasts, casseroles, main courses. Desserts have never really been my thing.\n  ","170082":"\n  I guess gold, or a palette of gold with warm reds and deep maroons. I think I associate these colors with love partially because they are sort of Valentine-y colors and it's socially ingrained, and partially because those are colors I would associate with warmth and treasure, and love is both.\n  ","170083":"\n  I have no idea. Probably on the corner of the bed while changing sheets.\n  ","170084":"\n  I don't have any good advice for this, but I'll list how I met people I went out with more than once or twice as an adult, in case that helps (at least, what I can remember):\n  \n  - gallery opening\n  \n  - through a mutual friend at a party\n  \n  - literally ran into on street corner while not paying attention\n  \n  - library\n  \n  - walked past him in a diner window a few times running errands on foot, he came out and asked me out for ice cream\n  \n  - internet gaming\n  \n  - goth-y little hole in the wall coffee shop\n  \n  - swing dance instructor\n  \n  - karaoke bar\n  \n  - co-worker\n  \n  - another co-worker\n  \n  My husband was that last co-worker. I guess the thing to learn here is- dates can be found everywhere, just do the things you like to do and expand your social circles in ways you're comfortable doing so. I didn't go into any of these situations expecting to meet someone. Good luck!\n  ","170085":"\n  my desk, with both Xmas Tree light options shown\n  ","170086":"\n  I had never heard of this until you brought it up.

I think there's been a recent shift as far as what is perceived as the \"timeline of adulthood\" that we've always been told to adhere to (college, marriage, house, family, etc). The economic climate, the amount of schooling required for so many of the desirable jobs, more acceptance of different family definitions, and so many other things have made renting or taking home ownership at a different pace than before the new norm.\n  \n  Personally I still want to own a home one day, but mainly because I want a yard or a little bit of land to buffer me from other people's noise, a chance to customize things to how I like them, and some beehives.\n  ","170089":"\n  Probably not. He is an extreme procrastinator, and I feel like that would be his undoing pretty quickly.\n  ","170090":"\n  I've been to a couple, and in fact went to the Thanksgiving Buffet at the Kennedy School this past Thanksgiving which was my first time going to that particular McMenamin's, it was very nice. I didn't get a chance to soak in the pools, but some homeless folks asked me on my way out to the car if I had so I guess that's a thing most people that look like me go there to do :P  Maybe one day. The other ones I've been to were small pubs, I can't remember which locations. The food is very good, and if it didn't require travel to Alaska, I'd consider the McMeniman Passport Challenge.\n  ","170091":"\n  I would just like a good hug, and it really doesn't matter so much with who as long as they are not stinky or scary\n  ","170092":"\n  I mostly agree, but there are always exceptions. If you're comfortable standing up against a problem and saying or doing something and it won't put you in danger to do so, then yes absolutely be proactive. However there are certain situations where someone might be in danger if they do or say something and in those cases obviously safety comes first.\n  ","170093":"\n  Lullaby in Birdland, Girl from Ipenema, Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone, Black Coffee, other random jazz standards.

Other voices that I've found grab my attention are Boy George, Valerie Teicher\/Tei Shi, Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, Joni Mitchell, Jeff Buckley, and Lady Gaga.\n  ","170104":"\n  In the mood I've been in most of today, I'd choose people who were unable to reproduce.\n  \n  If I had to choose for realsies, I guess I'd choose an equal amount of healthy and reproductively sound and willing young adults from each region of the world, making sure that all were well-versed in the stories and heritage of their region's people so that they could passed down and recorded. Each person would need to be willing and able to survive under whatever conditions, and there would probably be tests devised to measure those sorts of things in the screening process. It feels so clinical and gross thinking about this. I would definitely not choose myself. My genes do not need to be carried on to a new world of humankind.\n  ","170105":"\n  Well, we've established I like Emmitt Otter, but other favorites include: Scrooged, Elf, Muppet's Christmas Carol, and A Charlie Brown Christmas. Sometimes I will pull out my copy of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. My husband always wants to watch Die Hard or Gremlins.\n  ","170106":"\n  haha I SHOULD have one, right? I'm old enough for sure and I definitely like femme pop lately- but during the time they were popular, I was pretty exclusively listening to punk, new wave, and classic rock.

I'm actually in the middle of a medical roller coaster trying to figure out why my cortisol levels are so high (adrenaline hormone) in some areas of my body but not others, and all these other symptoms are presenting and I guess severe anxiety and mood swings are part of the dealio while I wait for yet another specialist to call and schedule with me (next is a neurologist). Before all this, I managed it somewhat well but still not really really well. I have a xanax prescription and a medical marijuana recommend but weed is really the only thing that helps. And a good cry. and yoga when I'm able. None of them are absolute though.  There are a few other types of non-benzo anti-anxiety things a doctor can prescribe, I know a lot of people find relief with Buspar. My best advice is talk to your doc, do some exercise if you're able, make time to feel your feelings, self-care self-care self-care, and smoke weed everyday :P\n  ","170109":"\n  I feel like I barely talk out loud lately, past a couple of hours in the evenings. I don't recall cussing in my head very much, but I'm sure I do it. Probably a lot. I'm just not really conscious of my thoughts as words always? Oh god now I'm sitting here trying to overthink this and it's getting weird I'm too high for this mess lol\n  ","170110":"\n  Owls, all of 'em. I have a large collection of weird owl stuff.

It seems to be just another shitty saying giving the head of the household some semblance of power in this crap world.\n  ","170113":"\n  People around here move in and out so quick I don't really get to know anyone.

I never read Anne Rice's novels or the Twilight books. Typical Dracula-type lore seems to have too many ways to die. The Buffyverse would mean some messed up forehead wrinkle action, and not being able to be in sunlight, Tru Blood vamps can't do the sunlight thing either plus have the realllllly gory, sticky deaths....but that might be okay if I had a faerie hanging around to let me sip on. I guess I'd have to pick the new AHS vamps, even though I don't know much about them yet- they don't morph into fanged wrinkle-heads, they can enjoy limited amounts of sunlight, and while they seem to be able to BE immortal, they're not invincible so that seems like a good thing to know after a few thousand years or whatever when things are just atrociously awful and boring.\n  ","170118":"\n  If a problem comes along, you must whip it\n  ","170119":"\n  Like many of the others I've seen answer your question so far, I'd want to establish some sort of wealth or at least set things up so that I could accrue wealth, by whatever means necessary. Living forever is going to be quite expensive. While doing that, the time would likely be passed learning, exploring, finding ways to enrich my now endless life. I'd want to keep it hidden from people, except maybe a very select few. I feel like there would be too much risk of abduction and experimentation. Then again, maybe once I'd done everything I feel I could do in the world, I ought to donate myself to select scientific communities to study, maybe whatever it is that makes me immortal could help cure something in mortals, who knows.\n  \n  I mean, unless I'm a vampire.

She says we walked past it and I didn't say a word, just reached out to it like it was the only thing I could see anymore and when she picked it up and handed it to me, I hugged it and didn't want to let go. So Snoopy and I were besties for years. I still have him in storage, though his ears, nose, arms, legs, and tail have all been re-sewn about a zillion times and he's quite grey now.\n  \n  Now, I dunno, I guess my PC\/internet access really.

Like, I thought 2014 was bad but then came 2015. I had hopes, things seemed like they were looking up, and then I just started getting sicker and sicker and now I'm in the never-ending medical mystery tour, from specialist to specialist, being told I may have a brain tumor, then being told that's fine but I may have a neurological disorder or possibly something wrong with an ovary and I don't even know my tests are all over the place.\n  \n  Good things that happened in 2015: I got a lot of creative work done, although game making is on hold again as both myself and my partner are having major personal issues currently.

The stigma against the mentally ill is dangerous and heartbreaking. I try to always stay very open about what I'm going through because I am able to without too much of a tax on my well-being.

I do not unfollow people often, but I don't choose to follow new people often either.\n  ","170137":"\n  I almost never remember to eat lunch, to be honest. When I do, it's generally a protein bar or an egg sandwich.\n  ","170138":"\n  I had a terrible childhood. My mother is a high-functioning, untreated Narcissist with Borderline Personality Disorder. My earliest memories mostly include myself as barely a toddler, 2 or 3, climbing across my crib to the dresser and then down so I could go feed myself breakfast because Mom wouldn't be rolling out of bed for several hours. From the time my parents divorced at age 3 until my ex-stepfather moved in, I have no memories of my mother past seeing her chain smoke while talking to her girlfriends on the phone. HBO and MTV were basically my only companions until my baby sister was old enough to join me in our neglect. Once she was older, I was responsible for her as well. I was the 4th grader packing our lunches and making sure we had our homework and were ready for school. I was also the 4th grader wearing stiletto heels to walk to school with 6 colors of eye shadow piled on because I had no mom to look at me and say WTF you can't wear that.\n  \n  When I was 10, my mom and ex-stepdad had a son, and things changed slightly but ONLY because he got all freaked out over shit finally once it applied to his \"real\" kid. At that point, I became the \"scapegoat\". My brother the baby was the \"Golden Child\" and my sister avoided conflict and attention as much as possible by keeping her head down and doing whatever Mom said, essentially forcing her to pretend she was my mother at that age to appease my mother (playing softball even though she hated it, having boyfriends at the skating rink, all the same shit that was important to my mother as a teen).\n  \n  I was in constant conflict with her because I'd spent a decade being the adult of the house and I wasn't keen on suddenly being told what to do, especially by someone who so clearly had no fucking idea what she was doing. She approved of literally nothing I did, picking fights literally just to make me cry. None of my friends were good enough, all of my teachers were out to get me- she hated for me to have a relationship with anyone else besides her because this woman who barely fucking looked at me most of my childhood suddenly was jealous and mad that I didn't want to be her bff and number one daughter.\n  \n  Her neglect possibly lead to sexual abuse by one of her boyfriends. I've had flashbacks but I have nothing to go on. And the parties. No 5 year old should have to wake up and carefully step over strange men on the floor passed out. I remember trying to pour some rare and tasty orange juice from the fridge only to realize it had vodka in it after a sip.\n  \n  Anyway all of this culminated in me not speaking to her anymore and not having a relationship with my (now total sociopath, woman-beating) half-brother, or his dad who got a divorce like 5 or 6 years ago or some mess.\n  \n  I would love to have had a real mom.

I'd love to have a big Christmas morning in front of a big, pretty tree and open gifts and eat brunch together.\n  ","170157":"\n  I'm glad you're feeling better :) Sorry I couldn't think up more questions, I've been going through some shit too.\n  \n  Self harm as part of OCD? I'm sure it's possible, I don't have any experience with that personally but there are a lot of things affected by it certainly. One of my OCD sub-types is Compulsive Skin Picking Disorder, but it's not done as a form of self harm at all, but because I'm compulsively trying to \"smooth\" out rough spots as a form of Contamination OCD.\n  \n  If you are harming yourself in order to feel something, or to punish yourself, sometimes that also falls into personality disorder categories, or possibly bipolar behavior. I recently read a book called \"Stop Walking on Eggshells\" about having loved ones with Borderline Personality Disorder, and I know self harm is one of the common symptoms of BPD. It's an interesting read if you're into that sort of thing.\n  \n  Sure, it's something to worry about. But is worrying about it going to make you obsess over it more? Is it something maybe to just be mindful of and consider carefully? Next time, think about why you're doing it. Consider what sensation you particularly want to feel. Can it be duplicated in a less damaging way? I have a friend who crushes ice cubes in his hands rather than punching himself. I remember someone in one of my college classes who snapped a thick rubber band against her wrist when she wanted to cut.\n  \n  Hope your progress continues, and good luck :)\n  ","170158":"\n  No. You are cared about.\n  ","170159":"\n  I actually really loathe Winter for the most part, but I do enjoy cozy clothes, tall boots, hot beverages, and fireplaces.\n  ","170160":"\n  I think I'm really good at wrapping presents! I did it professionally during and after college while working as a visual merchandiser first at a small gift\/card\/jewelry\/dance supply shop near my college and then after I left school as the visual merchandising asst. manager at a huge tourist attraction state-funded artisan and craft showcase in West Virginia. As far as tags and bows, it honestly depends on what I have on hand. I like to add ribbons for sure.\n  ","170161":"\n  I can't think of one book or documentary that changed the way I thought any more than any others. I'm not incredibly changeable, but I think that any well-done presentation of an idea might get gears moving towards change of thought in a small way. I try to learn from everything.\n  ","170162":"\n  I bought a men's Weatherproof brand flannel shirt with corduroy trim that retails for around $50 for $9 last month, and it's my favorite around-the-house shirt lately.\n  ","170163":"\n  I have a scar on my bottom lip from when I was rollerskating unattended in the street with my toddler fischer-price orange-yellow-blue plastic adjustable skates, tripped on a rock, and fell chin-first into the curb. My tooth went through my bottom lip.\n  \n  I also have a scar on my ass cheek from skin cancer, a scar on my left tit from where they biopsied one of my adenomas and implanted a clip, and some random cat scratch and normal injury scars.\n  ","170164":"\n  Whenever I eat vegetable pakora, especially if it's prepared with bright yellow seasonings, I remember the first time I tried Indian food, on a road trip to Richmond with my bestie at the time Justin. We were 17\/18 and completely ridiculous and had such a good time.\n  ","170165":"\n  weed and internetz\n  ","170166":"\n  When I was 19 I was dating this guy from New Hampshire who would come down and visit on weekends when he could (I was in Massachusetts at the time). His birthday was upcoming and we were celebrating his birthday early unexpectedly because he had thought he wouldn't be able to come down and then could at the last minute or something but ANYWAY I thought it would be nice to give him a sexy massage and bought some nice-smelling oils and thought \"oh, I could put this in this thin, cheap glass bowl with a tealight candle underneath and warm it a bit, that totally won't be a disaster\" so of course right as we're nekkid and I go to reach for the heated oil the bowl shattered EVERYWHERE and sliced up the birthday boy pretty bad (I jumped back and avoided getting cut)- not like, serious bad, but I can laugh about it now bad. Then I cried a lot because I felt like I ruined his birthday and he helped me clean everything up and still stayed the weekend like a fucking champ.\n  ","170167":"\n  Shut down computer, plug in my headphones to charge, turn off the hall light, say the the cats \"Goodnight babies be good\", try to get into the master bedroom before a cat darts in there, brush teeth\/use toilet, take off socks and any outer layers it's too warm for, plug in phone to charge, and then lay in bed praying to a god I don't really believe in- every single night- despite having never been taught to do that in an atheist household growing up. From there it's generally toss and turn 10 min,. pee again (I have Cushing's syndrome and it makes me pee a lot right now) and then sleep like a log for the rest of the night.\n  ","170168":"\n  Whatever feels right. Everyone deals with relationship ends differently.\n  ","170169":"\n  This is hard to answer, because I've been in love several times and each time was very different. The only consistent thing was that I knew it was love because I never questioned it. I just accepted it as true. Lust, I don't know much about these days. It's definitely not as lasting as love, but sometimes just as fierce. I still love people I no longer feel lust for.\n  ","170170":"\n  I was 16 and my friend's older brother was having a graduation party at his house so I walked down there with my sister and brother to have a hotdog and say \"hi\" or whatever but I ended up chatting with this guy who had just graduated from my high school who I sort of knew and we ended up taking a walk around the block- and it started raining- and he kissed me in the rain, standing in someone else's yard. I don't remember anything about the kiss itself. I ended up dating that guy very briefly because my mother for whatever reason encouraged me to date adults as a young teen but I ended up breaking his heart before anything was very serious.\n  ","170171":"\n  I'm going to go with Hootie and the Sunshine Band on this one.\n  ","170172":"\n  So so so often, with a lot of people. I think that being mentally ill leads me to choose relationships and friendships that are a bit unstable sometimes. The love is real when it's there, but things sometimes explode and dissipate.\n  ","170173":"\n  I went through a few months where all I wanted to eat was Texas toast and fried okra.\n  ","170174":"\n  thank you Leigh <3\n  ","170175":"\n  I was really surprised when they were voting  on the \"new 7 wonders\" and the Easter Island statues weren't winners, so I think I'd pick them.

Nah, I never give a fake name, mostly just because I've been saying the same thing for so long that it just comes out of my mouth in those situations... \"Campbell. Like the soup.\"\n  ","170177":"\n  This is tough because I so rarely watch movies but some movies are so important to me and they are all over the place. I guess if I was choosing for the potential new movies that might come out in future years, I'd pick horror. I enjoy horror movies and would hate to miss new ones. I'd really miss the Mad Max movies and Muppet\/Froud everything and plenty of dark comedies.\n  ","170178":"\n  thank you everyone for the nice, distracty questions :)  I'm going to savor them and answer one only when I reallllly need to feel better.

The attacks in Paris were absolutely atrocious....just like all of the other attacks in all of the other less white, less Western countries.\n  \n  As far as this pianist and other shit like it- it reminds me of when I was an etsy seller and every time there was a devastating event, you'd see other sellers popping up \"tribute\" items in their shops claiming to send some minuscule percentage to some charity or what not but clearly the purpose of these items was to cash in on tragedy and get shop traffic.\n  ","170184":"\n  Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Liam Hemsworth, Orlando Bloom\n  ","170185":"\n  me.\n  ","170186":"\n\n   https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pituitary_adenoma\n  \n","170187":"\n  the Realm of the Elderlings\n  ","170188":"\n  oh for fucks sake is this another weird fetish dude\n  ","170189":"\n  Um, nope?\n  ","170190":"\n  When I had family close and we had get-togethers, I enjoyed cooking big meals. I'm not much of a baker or dessert-maker, but sometimes I'd make peanut butter cookies or banana bread or one time I made baklava. In general though I've been tasked with main dishes, soups, or casseroles, which I'm much more confidant about. Now, it's just me and my husband mostly so we've been in the habit of going to restaurants for the holidays.\n  ","170191":"\n  I'm someone who feels guilt inappropriately. I feel cripplingly guilty over things I have zero control over. It rarely has anything to do with anything I've actually done. Normally, I'm okay with the choices I make and feel that I am morally \"good\" though maybe that doesn't always line up with other's ideas of that or whatever. I don't generally feel too guilty over my actions, I guess, unless they were a bad choice that I didn't think through thoroughly. However, I'll feel so anxiously guilty over the fact that one of my cats batted at a cabinet door at 2 am and it was kind of loud and a neighbor might have heard that I won't be able to make eye contact for a week.\n  ","170192":"\n  pretty messed up.\n  ","170193":"\n  Sure.

I have deleted a couple of questions I just didn't have the life experiences to answer, but I assume that's pretty normal for people to do.\n  ","170195":"\n  Absolutely. I would try all other resources first, but if it came down to it, I would do what was necessary for my loved ones and I to not starve. Life is more important than retail shrink.\n  ","170196":"\n  My self-care comforts include oversized men's flannel shirts, peppermint tea, my overpriced polk wireless headphones playing a Spotify playlist I created specifically for calming me down, and weed. If none of that helps, then xanax and sleep.\n  \n  I love hugs, but I hate being clung to. So I guess I prefer my own space, but will happily accept small breaks from my own space. I am terrible at comforting others I feel, though I dunno. I just try to be honest, genuine, and actively listen.\n  ","170197":"\n  I think it's absolutely ridiculous. I had a friend at one time who spent several years in a federal prison for being homeless and stealing toiletries. His third strike was for Speed Stick deodorant.\n  ","170198":"\n  Yeah, it shows that the American justice system hates people of color. I've known a lot of criminals strangely enough, and most of them were white and served MUCH less time for worse crimes than the African Americans I know who have also been incarcerated.\n  ","170199":"\n  I do my best to- and if I don't, it has nothing to do with how they appear but maybe their tone or the vibe they put off. If someone is aggressive from the start and seems like an uncaring person, I'll probably start off on the wrong foot with them. Sometimes I'm pretty unfair in that way. I admit freely that my mood weighs in a lot on how charming I am when I meet someone new. I do try to control that though :(\n  ","170200":"\n  I have a lot of anxiety and panic issues, that I'm being told now are likely caused by this tumor on my pituitary gland so maybe that will change after we get this shit sorted- but- for the meantime, I'm basically on the verge of an adrenaline imbalance at all times and can get realllllly angry for basically nothing.\n  \n  The questions most likely to trigger that fury are: 1. questions about motherhood\/assuming that I'm fertile or a parent- I am not on either count, and it makes me really mad as a feminist when I feel like women are reduced to Maiden, Mother, or Crone roles and disregarded otherwise. Women are more than their opinions on babies or their ability to breed. 2. As with the Maiden, Mother, Crone statement, I also absolutely detest questions about \"virginity\" or any very personal sexual questions. That's no one's business unless we know each other very well or are having a conversation about that specifically- and privately. 3. I hate being asked things that don't have anything to do with my thoughts or opinions on something but instead want me to basically act as google for the asker. I'm not Google.\n  \n  As far as things I may have answered before but wouldn't now- I can't think of anything. I've always been pretty touchy about the same sorts of things.\n  ","170201":"\n  Ooof. I haven't even started thinking about gifts yet. We really don't buy them for anyone other than the little kid nephews and niece and sometimes something small for each other but even that gets put aside some years. My concern at Christmas time is always more about sending cards and getting the tree up- past that, I'm like, whatever. I think my oldest nephew wants ninja turtle stuff lately- his soon-to-be-brother needs newborn clothes, and my niece I have no idea, I don't talk to her parents so we'll probably just send whatever I find that looks cute.\n  \n  Ideally, of course, I'd have tons of money and buy gifts for everyone I care about- and I love to choose things for people- but with my medical bills always and only having one steady income, it just can't happen. If I had a nice house with a big kitchen and room for people to stay, I'd love to host a big Christmas party where people could stay overnight and there would be food and games and time spent together, preferably somewhere with a nice mountain or forest view- maybe I'd cook a big roast, a Virginia ham, and a tofurky with all sorts of sides and desserts. I have no idea what I would want for Christmas gifts for myself. I guess a slanket.\n  ","170202":"\n  glance at phone to see what I'm up against, pee, brush teeth, try to make sense of at least my bangs and push the rest back in a bun, grab a ginger ale to take my meds with, turn on my computer, open all the blinds while it boots up.\n  ","170203":"\n  I embrace social change but fear personal change\n  ","170204":"\n  So in case you all were wondering I asked the left\/right question because I was sitting here high thinking about how it was weird that a do almost everything with my left hand but when it comes to touching my face for whatever reason, it's always the right hand that reacts. Now I'm just interested in how typical handedness and everything-else-edness runs.\n  ","170205":"\n  Sorry, it was just too stressful to now know for sure\n  ","170206":"\n  I didn't want to speculate so I googled it. SPOILER:\n  \n  it stays whatever color it was before going in to the mirrors, unless it gets scared and then it gets darker than that color.\n  ","170207":"\n  like, practically all of them\n  ","170208":"\n  We celebrate mildly, in that we do generally dress nice and go to a special dinner somewhere or other, but I don't decorate or go all out or anything. Thanksgiving is kind of just the holiday that has to happen so that I can finally dig out my Christmas ornaments because although I'm not Christian and have no real religious or spiritual ties to Christmas I'm really really into the lights and tree decorating.\n  ","170209":"\n  We were driving across town a couple of weeks ago and saw a high-speed police chase that resulted in the guy being chased losing control, bouncing into the median, and then bouncing from there to the other direction into the treeline. He was only mildly injured and no one else was hit, it WAS pretty miraculous because he was all over the place.\n  ","170210":"\n  I walked out of the theater for the Hitchhiker's Guide movie. I can't even pick one thing that was bad, because literally everything was bad. From the opening musical dolphin number to how terrible the acting was..... ugh. Ugh, ugh, ugh.\n  ","170211":"\n  I do work best under pressure, but only without distraction. I haven't had a hard deadline in a while, but they're coming, I can smell them. I can't remember the last time I was in an especially pressurized work situation tbh, I haven't held a \"real\" job in a long time.\n  ","170212":"\n  I don't like to use the word \"obsessed\" unless I'm specifically referring to behaviors resulting from having OCD, but I very much enjoy and look forward to new episodes of Steven Universe, Bob's Burgers, Fresh Off the Boat, and American Horror Story: Hotel lately.\n  ","170213":"\n  I'm left-handed, too.  Like Jimi Hendrix. I didn't know what else to say.\n  ","170214":"\n  Sorry Yung Humma, I prefer mine fried.\n  ","170215":"\n  One week seems fair\n  ","170216":"\n  I mean, maybe, but-\n  \n  I mean like if you go try to rob a KFC and it goes bad, you just lock yourself in with the other customers. That's what the locks are for. Then they bring you pizza and promise you shit until you come out and get shot at. Or at least this is what I've learned from TV.\n  ","170217":"\n  Wait what?! Where is this 24 hour KFC and why isn't it close to me?\n  \n  And to lock in the hostages, of course.\n  ","170218":"\n  Lately I worry that I am attracted to people who provide very specific negative behaviors to fit a pattern in my life caused by a negligent mother, so that's kinda weird I guess. Otherwise, usually we have some things in common, some things not, I guess. I don't recall ever having been very attracted to someone who had nothing or little in common with me.\n  ","170219":"\n  I'm not a mother and therefore don't have answers for that sort of question. I choose not to discuss my sexual life almost ever. Anything else usually is fine.\n  ","170220":"\n  I walked past someone at a craft store a few weeks ago that smelled JUST like Grape Bonkers used to smell and it really brought back some (overly sweet) memories.\n  ","170221":"\n  Psh- acting like you don't know what the new LaBron Hoots look like. You're just jealous.\n  ","170222":"\n  I will forgive a million different grammar errors (and I'm certainly no grammar expert), but hearing someone end a question with the word \"at\" makes me feel physically sick. \"Where do you want to meet at?\" \"Where do they live at?\" ughhhh\n  ","170223":"\n  It's a glass and steel sculpture that was on a little neighborhood river walk a couple of towns over from me. I don't remember how we ended up over there but I thought it was neat- there were lots of little artsy things along the path, including a mosaic in a underpass with a local native story that I completely can't recall right now, and other strange sculptural pieces here and there. All of this begins in a parking lot for a blanket manufacturer\/wool mill which is also a bit strange. I dunno, Washington is weird. It probably is alien communications lol.\n  ","170224":"\n  In person, I'm going to say something without hesitation. They said that mess in public and they deserve to be held accountable for it. Online (as you already know hahaha sorry) there's a possibility I'll stick my nose in but only if I'm SUPER triggered. In the case in particular this Q references, I waited until the two asshats were both kinda of given the \"are you joking right now?!?!\" comment from you, 'cause I figured at that point you were not having their shit anymore, either, and I was there to not only express my anger but also to back you up.\n  \n  Usually, I keep my mouth shut on other people's facebook posts. I have a friend who always has terrible racists on her posts, but she is in a position where they are family or whatnot and often approaches their comments in a way that indicates that she's trying to just keep things from escalating- so I wouldn't ever comment on her posts because obviously that would escalate things. I personally don't like drama on my page, and have blocked people for trying to debate my opinion with me uninvited, but if it was for whatever reason not caught and deleted by me first and a friend jumped in to back up my opinion or whatever for me, I would be okay with that. Usually I let it go, but in rare cases, I just fly in there like a tornado of fists.  *shrug*\n  ","170225":"\n  Well, my sister's family- with my two young nephews- live in MS as well so this is pretty disturbing news. I'm not sure how to fix it. I've not been very interested in politics until more recently, to be honest. I mean, I'd say through education but apparently that's not even being adequately funded. It's going to take extreme action of some sort I just don't know what would be the best course of action and what the risks vs. rewards would be.\n  ","170226":"\n  I can't think of any personal memories, but one of my exes has a really great one. He was riding his scooter in the parking lot of some music venue that Huey was going to be playing at back in the 80s, when my ex was around 6 or so. The band saw him, and came out to ask his mom if they could ride the scooter too. So I guess they all - the band and my ex as a 6 year old- goofed off and took turns riding his scooter.\n  ","170227":"\n  I'd love to gather all of the people, past and present, that I've ever found especially interesting (or at least, the kind ones) for a huge weekend party in a nice location where our needs are met extravagantly and I could catch up with people and watch them interact with each other. I don't exclusively mean just people I knew or know well and am friends with- I would love to see teachers who were especially influencing, people online I've found particularly interesting, etc. Just a big mix of people who all left an impression for one reason or another.\n  ","170228":"\n  I wasn't able to find this video, but just from what I've gathered from the question and others' answers, yes I believe the teacher crossed a line. I have no idea what the fight was about, how bad the fight was, etc. not having seen the video or having been there, so maybe the teacher felt they had no other choice in order to protect the other students before police or security or whatever could arrive, but even so it should have been done non-violently.\n  ","170229":"\n  My two most well-liked posts (tied at 9 likes) are a .gif of the Rock wearing a fanny pack and an answer about emojis where I said I wanted a skateboarding owl with a middle finger extended. Basically what I've learned is that you all only like me when I'm being corny. I guess I'm more surprised how many answers I put a lot of thought into had so little likes, but que sera, sera.\n  ","170230":"\n  I think there must be SOMETHING out there, but whether they are \"wild men\" or a type of primate or a separate thing altogether, I don't know. What's especially interesting to me is that just about every region has a similar creature (Oren Pendak, Yeti, Tah tah kle ah, Swamp Ape, Yowie, etc) so whatever they are, they're basically everywhere...maybe :)\n  ","170231":"\n  This happens every time I draw. It can happen occasionally while reading or playing a game, but it always happens when I'm making art. It's why I prefer to set my work time to very late at night, or at least one of the reasons. I can go into my trance-like state without missing phone calls\/texts or being interrupted or whatnot.\n  ","170232":"\n  past traumas\n  ","170233":"\n  tell it to stop that nonsense\n  ","170234":"\n  The one that involves a person traveling somewhere and somehow ends up having a spider or other insect lay eggs in their face\/chest\/mouth\/whatever is one that definitely scares me haha. I know there's a billion variations of this urban legend and it's pretty unlikely that there's truth to it, or at least it's a case of extreme hyperbole but it still is one of those things I occasionally remember and get grossed out about.\n  \n  I'm always interested in different variations of the Sasquatch legends\/myths\/folktales.\n  ","170235":"\n  I believe that there is much we do not know and can't explain. I've had tons of personal experiences but I've found it never matters what evidence you present, people are either going to believe you or they won't. Also, I have delusions during extreme bouts of anxiety and panic sometimes so like, who's going to believe the schizophrenic girl about haunted houses, shadow people,  or strange things in the woods.\n  ","170236":"\n  My grandmother had tons of old Appalachian old wive's tales to tell when we were growing up, certainly. Most seemed to indicate that you'd either have generalized bad luck for however many years, someone was thinking about you, or you were going to receive a letter or gift. I don't believe in any of them, but I still think about them every time a situation comes up that involves one (ear ringing, itchy palm, walk under a ladder, etc etc. )\n  \n  I occasionally make up my own superstitions and then follow those, but that has less to do with reality or belief and more to do with obsessive and compulsive behaviors :P\n  ","170237":"\n  I always joke that I don't run for anything, even zombies- so if they're fast, then I'm in trouble. If there were an apocalyptic event that didn't involve fast zombies, then I think maybe I could. I have no idea what I'd use or how I'd do things, that seems like the sort of situation I'd probably handle best flying by the seat of my pants.\n  ","170238":"\n  I have, unwillingly. A few days back I told about the self-styled shaman who thought I was some sort of prophet or whatever for a while. This wasn't an isolated incident. Beginning in my mid-teens, I have attracted that type of person.. I have nothing AGAINST anyone's faith or religious practices, and that includes the new-agey set, but it's not really something I have much faith in myself. Nowadays, I stay more vigilant about noticing what's going on around me so I can shut down mentally and use body-language to discourage strangers approaching me about odd things but it still happens once in a blue moon.\n  \n  The palmist story is one of the few that really left a bad taste in my mouth, rather than just leaving me startled or amused like the others.\n  \n  I saw him a few bars down in Louisville, KY while I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette at a karaoke bar on Bardstown Rd. about 8 years ago. I had recently been diagnosed with \"unexplained infertility\", after spending several years seeing specialist after specialist who couldn't determine what specifically was causing my reproductive system to give me so much trouble. Anyway, a friend of ours' uncle or aunt or someone owned a karaoke bar and I met a friend of mine and her mother out there with Jon to blow off some steam.\n  \n  He was like, 5'9\"-ish, skinny, pale, with INTENSE eyes, longish blonde hair, and glasses. He kept trying to make eye contact, and he skeeved me out so I stubbed out my cigarette and went back in, walking immediately past my friends toward the back of the bar to use the restroom.\n  \n  When I came back out, he was SITTING AT THE TABLE WITH MY FRIENDS AND HUSBAND. I don't know how he knew who I was with. It was thankfully my turn up, so I sang whatever it was I had picked, and came back to my table. He was still there. He had read my friend and her mom's palms, and they were tipsy and thought it was funny and insisted I let him do mine.\n  \n  I gave in and handed over my hand kind in a kinda bitchy way. He had definitely crossed WAY too many lines already. he grabbed it and his hand was really cold. he traced a few lines with his finger and I yanked my hand back. He stood up, eyes wide, big dumb fucking smile on his face, and said \"you're gonna have a boy!\"\n  \n  I was seething. I tossed back the rest of my beer, slammed the bottle down, wiped my mouth, stood up calmly while he's just still all elated, looking at me waiting for me to rejoice, and I told him to get the fuck away from me and never fucking come back. I had tears in my eyes. I told Jon we were leaving. His face fell as it dawned on him that I wasn't celebrating and was like \"I didn't say that to be mean, I know you don't think you're going to but you're going to have a boy and that's what's supposed to happen\". I left and it has bugged me since (and yes I'm still child-free)\n  ","170239":"\n  Waste more of it. I always feel rushed as it is now, and I know I have plenty of time to do things. I just can't get myself motivated to do them, or don't feel well enough, or planned my preparation time poorly, or was distracted by something out of my control, or whatever. It seems to take me three times longer to do things than others with a better grasp on time management.\n  ","170240":"\n  Conceptually, I think they're kinda gross. I'm not one of those people who gets excited about the realllllllllly weird jelly bean flavors (buttered popcorn and jalapeno are two that cross my mind especially that I am not a fan of). I've not tried the actual commercial version. Since they're made by Jelly Belly, who also makes the aforementioned disgusting flavors, I imagine I'll be on the fence on a few flavors of their Bertie Bott's as well.\n  ","170241":"\n  and I said hey yeah yeah eh eh hey yeah eh I said Hey.

I assume it's a sit-com.\n  ","170245":"\n  oh my goodness I haven't thought about that show in ages. I watched it when it was on, at least the first few seasons. It was pretty funny I guess. I liked the Janitor, and the wife of that one grumpy doctor.\n  ","170246":"\n  eh, I just want to travel. I've only left my country (US) once, and that was for a cruise to the Bahamas so I didn't even need a passport. Now that I live in a state that is on a border, I would really like to at least go into Canada one day but I still need to get that passport situation handled.\n  ","170247":"\n  I don't believe in virginity. Also, you are asking a 35 year old woman who's been married for over a decade.\n  ","170248":"\n  It's a tie between myself and my best friend. We've both gone through horrible traumatic shit (separate things but during the same time frame) in the past nearly 2 years and we're totally kicking ass and coming through the worst of things.\n  ","170249":"\n  Well, I don't locally source my rice so I'm not sure what it's history is, but there's no judgement here as long as it's delicious.\n  \n  I cook jasmine rice in chicken broth, saute some green chiles and tomatos (I am lazy so I use Ro-tel in a can), chicken breast pieces, a finely-diced pickled chipotle pepper (also from a can), some minced garlic, and a few dashes of whatever good hot sauce I have and then mix the rice in really well. It's pretttttty good.\n  ","170250":"\n  Yes, absolutely. I've always had it, but in my earlier years I spent a lot of time doubting my gut impressions. After being proven right in the worst ways possible, I started listening to my intuition more.\n  ","170251":"\n  Mmmm, spinach artichoke dip. I like a lot of the things I cook, but I can't think of anything I \"cant get enough of\" right now, I get sick of things pretty quickly even if they are amazing. If my husband were to choose, he would pick my fried chicken and broccoli casserole, my pot roast, or my dirty rice.\n  ","170252":"\n  Honestly, I don't often assume anyone is as good (or as bad) as everyone says so I'm never really surprised. Don't get me wrong, I love humanity and I absolutely think that people are capable of great, good, loving things- but I also know that humans are grey area beings, not entirely black or white, good or bad.\n  ","170253":"\n  This coming April marks our 12 year anniversary\n  ","170254":"\n  Gee, exist as a mentally ill person, I guess. Super \"crazy\".\n  ","170255":"\n  Take more, take as much as you want, post them everywhere\/anywhere you feel comfortable, and if someone tries to shame you for it, tell them to fuck off.\n  \n  I love selfies. I love seeing people happy with how they look and who they are for a moment. When I'm able to keep my head above the sea of anxiety and self-loathing my mental illnesses saddle me with, I often take selfies of myself because DAMN I FEEL GOOD. Seeing other's answers shaming people for taking\/posting selfies makes my skin crawl so despite having the flu and looking\/feeling like crap, here's a selfie for them.\n  ","170256":"\n  I do, but it's really only because it's such a raw album and- I think- harnesses the best of both Cale and Reed. Sister Ray is iconic imo. That's not to say I dislike other albums- I do enjoy the self titled album most for specific songs (Ferryboat Bill is prob my favorite), but I think White Light\/White Heat has a more cohesive sound overall. The S\/T w Nico I'll listen to once in a blue moon but all I hear is Warhol's influence which I'm not in love with.\n  ","170257":"\n  I have it set to randomly select from a pool of about 25 images and it changes every hour, but here's what it is now (the rest are almost entirely owls, Steven Universe, and Fury Road related)\n  ","170258":"\n  When I was 17-18 and worked in a mall, an adult co-worker of mine, his wife who worked downstairs at Gloria Jean's and their weird little cult group of woo woos decided I was some sort of new age second-coming or whatever that was prophesied by the co-worker who was some sort of self-styled shaman and ANYWAY they never did anything weird to me and I got free coffee so I just let them believe what they wanted. When I moved away to college I never saw or heard from any of them again.\n  ","170259":"\n  lol no prob- and totally it's underrated- I like other songs of hers from different albums better than Artpop songs singularly, but as a whole it's the most cohesive and well done I think. There's only like, 2 songs on that album I skip and one of those is still an amazing song I just hate hearing R.

It's been a bad month for anxiety and panic for me, and since my usual medical grower had a few crops bite the dust this Summer during an unexpected heat wave with a broken swamp cooler, I've been purchasing sub-par medicine which is only adding to the anxiety. That leaves me most days with the choice of taking xanax instead and being unable to work because zombie, or just pushing through the waves of panic, which hasn't been easy. I'm not sure why I'm so keyed up, I'm sure it's a combination of a billion things.\n  \n  My work partner and I decided to lift one of our self-imposed deadlines this week and push things back a bit, though, so that is helping substantially today.\n  ","170267":"\n  For whatever reason, deja-vu experiences for me mostly occur as a response to reading or writing something. Always words. I don't remember any instances, as these things are always fleeting, but I do know they're generally triggered by words.\n  ","170268":"\n  I really do, actually, but only when I am not restricted by budget or space. Currently, we are saving for a trip back East to see our families, so food budget is lower than I prefer... and my kitchen is an awful little apartment galley kitchen, so I don't much love cooking in it.\n  ","170269":"\n  Men need to stand up to other men. All those supposed \"nice guys\" out there need to actually be nice guys and start letting their male friends know that harassment and sexism are unacceptable behaviors, and by setting an example. Our current society's extremely toxic and damaging masculinity teaches boys and men that it's okay to objectify, claim, and harass women, and until the men out there who see how this is very obviously wrong start standing up to their male peers nothing will change.\n  \n  To the others who answered this who blamed women for having breasts? Don't ever fucking contact me.\n  \n  The ones who said nothing can be done? Do you mean to honestly tell me that it's natural, human behavior to sexually harass and threaten women? When was the last time you received a rape threat or unsolicited sexually graphic messages from an unknown woman?\n  ","170270":"\n  1. Concerns about GMOs. Every piece of fruit I've purchased this year probably had genetic modifications done at some point in it's family history, and every piece was delicious.\n  \n  2. The \"War on Terror\".\n  \n  3. Cecil the mutha-effin' Lion\n  ","170271":"\n  1. Human Rights of all sorts, including racism\/sexism\/homophobia\/transphobia\/classism\/ableism as well as worker's rights, fair trade issues, access to medical care, etc.\n  \n  2. finding alternate and sustainable fuel\n  \n  3. environmental protection and conservation\n  ","170272":"\n  Hrmmmm. I feel like there are tons of great things I've found recently and I'm totally blanking on every single thing. I do think itch.io is pretty amazing for fans of indie games as well as fledgling devs looking for jam info. Also my amazon wishlist is pretty amazing (searchable with shehitsback@yahoo.com, I believe)  everyone should know about that! lol.\n  ","170273":"\n  Yeah, this one's sort of silly. I doubt anyone answered with \"no internet\", we are an internet culture. I prefer road trips and boats anyway.\n  ","170274":"\n  Oh, I don't know. I say about anything's okay, but then freak out on people who ask too many \"mommy\" questions or focus on sexuality while anonymous. From YOU, anything probably IS okay, we've been ask folks together for a long time.\n  \n  Obviously the anon spam\/hate\/fetish stuff is unacceptable but apparently I've finally scared most of those folks off.\n  ","170275":"\n  I'm feeling stable, the people closest to me are feeling stable, and enjoyment and peace are found in conversations with each other either online or in person. Maybe a walk through a park or on a short trail through the forest happens. The weather is partly sunny, cool but not cold. I feel rested, and without guilt over things I can't control.\n  ","170276":"\n  I had to google search this lyric. I know it's shocking and unheard of, but despite smoking a lot of weed I only like maybe 4 Grateful Dead songs- three of which are on their most marketable album and one that was a hit during the early days of MTV\n  ","170277":"\n  I haven't watched anything on Netflix recently, actually. Not since I finished Bojack Horseman about a month or so ago. I have phases where I want to watch shows, but they're generally spaced far apart to make room for the phases where I'd rather listen to music or a podcast or whatnot than watch something while I work.\n  ","170278":"\n  Sometimes I consider re-taking my family name, or hyphenating my last names, but there's a certain amount of safety in having an ultra common name like mine. Sometimes as a female on the internet, the little bit of anonymity a too-common name affords is a pretty good thing to have.\n  ","170279":"\n  I imagined a really fat, angry goldfinch\n  ","170280":"\n  (I'll let you decide if I mean smoke weed or watch Steven Universe)\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3X-PUAYFMqk\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","170281":"\n  Okay, first of all-\n  \n  This is the best question of the day I've seen in my almost-a-year here. Thank you for asking one of the truly important questions.\n  \n  Also, Ring of Fire. Duh.\n  ","170282":"\n  thank you, I needed that today\n  ","170283":"\n  My first celebrity crushes were Tina Turner (from watching Beyond the Thunderdome) and David Bowie (from Labyrinth) but I don't recall which movie I saw first so I don't know who was first. I'm not sure why we have them- I don't currently really, except maybe appreciating Adrian Brody's nose. Growing up I always had celebrity crushes. I guess it's just a way to explore relationship and sexuality within the confines of our fantasy worlds without any chance of reality showing up and mucking it up.\n  ","170284":"\n  I really love the idea of those tree seed pods that you have your cremated remains put into, because I've always had such a fondness for trees and forests. I would like for there to be a small, private tree planting ceremony with my ashes, but past that I have no expectations or demands. I hope that the people who loved me will come and share nice memories and have whatever gathering is appropriate and best to help with their grief- I won't care, I'll be a tree.\n  ","170285":"\n  I was convinced I was straight until I was 35, despite a lifetime of major and intense crushes on both men and women. So I guess what I'm saying is, it's entirely possible to have no clue what your sexuality is without really going inward and exploring those questions with an open mind. I grew up with an abusive mother who very vocally hated lesbians (she has no problem with gay men just lesbians) and I guess I just internalized that and was afraid of my attraction to women and accepted that I was attracted to men too and that was good enough.\n  ","170286":"\n  I don't have a favorite place to think. My brain is a pitiful, overworked thing so it no longer differentiates between ideal places to think and otherwise, it just chugs along as best as it can.\n  ","170287":"\n  I'm not exactly sure what you mean by parent ring, but if you mean the gemstone rings for parents with the different colored stones, those represent their children. Each kid's birthstone is on the ring, usually in order of birth so like, if my mom had one which I think she did at one point but didn't wear, it would have a garnet because I was born in Jan., a sapphire because my sister was born in Dec., and another garnet for my brother. If you mean those purity ring things that dads give their daughters, I think they mean that you're in the Bible Belt.\n  ","170288":"\n  I want to get something with an owl and a log on my right inner forearm to commemorate Catherine Coulson\n  ","170289":"\n  I have had ZERO spam\/harassy questions today for the first time in months. It's gorgeous.\n  \n  It's like- I get trolling on some level or another- I don't think it's cool or a great thing to do to someone, but I can understand it sort of.... but it's sooooo tiresome having the same exact type of thing over and over and over and over again. I enjoy some of my anons. I even think some of the questions I delete for one reason or another are funny, even if they also kinda irritate me. But I won't tolerate lack of creativity.\n  ","170290":"\n  Definitely WoW. I played when it first came out for a few years, then lost interest. Took it up again because I had a Burning Crusade beta invite, and played up until I played the Wrath of the Lich King beta. I HATED that expansion, and didn't want to buy it, and hated how much time I was spending on the game, so I stopped playing for a long time... then broke my foot and had nothing better to do and picked it up again and this time, yeah, I had all the zeal I had in the beginning and then some- joined guilds, pvp'd seriously, etc. for a couple more years, and then just stopped. I don't know why. It stopped being fun.\n  ","170291":"\n  yes\n  ","170292":"\n  Here are all of the questions from (I assume) you today, so let me go ahead and address them all at once.\n  \n  1. Fuck you.\n  \n  2. Fuck you.\n  \n  3. Fuck you.\n  \n  4. Fuck you.\n  \n  Now. Should I block you? Or are you going to chill the fuck out? This was a light day, I admit, but I'm in a bad fucking mood and it's sooooo old and tired. I'm sorry that the only way you can speak to a woman is by harassment, it must suck to be such a terrible person.\n  ","170293":"\n  Loglady or Furiosa\n  ","170294":"\n  Followed :)\n  ","170295":"\n  how many cats they have and when I can pet those cats\n  ","170296":"\n  sweet bruh\n  ","170297":"\n  well I mean it's not really a matter of liking it or not, it's the best way to get a consistent texture for smoking your herb\n  ","170298":"\n  I'm currently working on a game that will be released first on mobile. It's early stages, so non-disclosure is the name of the game for right now. I'll talk about it plenty when I can though I'm sure.\n  ","170299":"\n  I have no idea what they have for youths around here because I am not and will not be a parent. I probably wouldn't volunteer for any sort of group\/club thing personally because while I like kids and kids like me, I have a lot of anxiety issues and noise is a trigger for me. Groups of kids on purpose that aren't related to me sounds like a nightmare. If I was absolutely forced to, I would probably do something art related.\n  ","170300":"\n  I've always managed to blurt it out without too much trouble when I felt it.\n  ","170301":"\n  I do not, and to be honest I assume the hurt a lot but I barely remember because that was such a long time ago. Teeth are weird.\n  ","170302":"\n  He's just a cutie. Look at that nose dimple! I'm also a big fan of his friendly eyes\/eyebrows and smile :)\n  ","170303":"\n  Animals, especially friendly ones. Ginger beer. Honeybees. Caring about people. Being cared about. Learning new things. Soft blankets. Forests. Folklore and the stories of other people. Fresh pineapple. Favorite socks. Classic video game arcades. Bakery smells.\n  ","170304":"\n  Nah. It feels like it sometimes though.\n  ","170305":"\n  Yes and No. I believe in it about as much as I believe in a lot of things related to religion and spirituality, which is less of a quantifiable belief and more of a small, wavering but persistent and indescribable feeling.  I don't not believe in karma.\n  ","170306":"\n  I'm sorry to hear that, anon. I do understand what that is like. I know that it's hard to talk about, and I know how sometimes it seems counter-intuitive to expend energy to get help when you don't care about yourself or what happens enough to really want it. I hope you will, though. There are a lot of great things in this world, even if it's hard to see that now.\n  \n  I recently heard of a service that I really loved the idea of, though I've not personally used it. It's a crisis line that communicates in text messages, for those of us who have anxiety about talking on the phone. If that sounds like something that might help you out, I encourage you to use it, at the very least to find out what options might be available to you locally if you decide to seek medical help for your depression. It's:\n  \n\n\n   http:\/\/www.crisistextline.org\/get-help-now\/\n  \n\n  I take Cymbalta (an anti-depressant) and some prescription supplements for depression, and it worked really well for me. I've cycled through tons of different medications to find one that worked, and sadly that is normal but it is worth it. It is such a relief to be able to reconsider things like GOALS again, and have thoughts that aren't centered about how I would kill myself in each current situation. I have also seen therapists in the past. Each of these options- or both together- can really really help control depression, if those are options you can afford and access. The link I posted up their could be a valuable tool for finding low-cost options too, I'm sure, as they are trained to help.\n  \n  Anyway, this is long.\n  \n  Thank you for reaching out to me. You made the first and hardest step. Next is reaching out again to someone with the tools to get you started on recovery. I wish you all of the energy, encouragement, motivation, and care you need to make this happen for yourself.\n  ","170307":"\n  Just thinking about that makes me wanna barf omg\n  \n  Also I had scrolled through tumblr a few min ago and I follow the Binding of Isaac blog I guess and the dev must have had a baby so there was this HUGE FUCKING PHOTO of a placenta and *Blerf*\n  ","170308":"\n  innie\n  ","170309":"\n  I haven't been getting enough protein, so lately I have been trying to eat a lot more of that. Eggs, protein bars, chicken, greek yogurt mainly. When Jon isn't in school we eat terribly. Usually pizza or burgers or something. I also eat a lot of fruit, and lately that's been pears, apples, and pineapples because that's what was on sale.\n  ","170310":"\n  I just deleted 6 from (I assume) the same person and I don't know who it is but they've got a real fucking problem.\n  ","170311":"\n  Fraggle Rock\n  ","170312":"\n  If there was a manservant available to keep you from asking me these same fucking questions over and over then I might hire him.\n  ","170313":"\n  I seem to have a lot of grey, red, teal, and black in my wardrobe but it's not really on purpose. My taste in clothing hasn't changed much since the mid-late 90s. Comfortable layers, menswear mixed in with florals, graphic tees and jeans, boots or mary janes or sneakers.\n  ","170314":"\n  I'm a pretty terrible self-motivator. I bribe myself a lot, like \"well if you finish all your sketches for the day you can eat ice cream\" or \"finish folding the laundry and then it's time to smoke up!\" and that works to a degree but not really. Stuff gets done around here but it's not through motivation so much as habit. My current goal is to start sticking to more of a regular schedule, and I'm getting there.\n  ","170315":"\n  I hadn't heard about this until now so if there's some subtler issues I'm not aware of please forgive me but just based on what you've said I think it's always good to see representation of REAL women in fashion ads. Women of all colors and sizes and backgrounds. So it seems great.\n  ","170316":"\n  coooookies\n  ","170317":"\n  I have binge-watched and I will binge-watch again. Shows I've binge-watched that I can remember currently are: Twin Peaks (twice), Northern Exposure, Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, OITNB, Cowboy Bebop, Seinfeld, Bojack Horseman.\n  ","170318":"\n  I'm not sure what that is, though it sounds like a camera thing. I haven't used a real camera in a long time, just my phone, and it didn't have a setting called \"auto-portrait\" when I checked a bit ago so I dunno. Maybe, probably not. That's my official answer.\n  ","170319":"\n  I'm a seizure tweezer ebeneezer\n  ","170320":"\n  wake up, look at phone, realize it's too early, sleep, wake up every half-hour from that point on until about 9 am, get up, pee, go back to bed, suddenly have amazing sleep with no interruptions until between 11 am and noon, wake up again, pee, brush teeth, grab my sweater if it's chilly, turn on hall lights, grab something to drink, wake up my computer, open the blinds in the office, have a team meeting online for however long and try to wake up at some point within that.\n  ","170321":"\n  I'm working on a video game with a friend, and am doing a good portion of the art for it (and will be managing anyone we add to the project later down the road) so currently, my art is concept sketching and digital art. I went to specialized grade and high schools for general fine arts, and majored in painting\/drawing in college though I was considering a switch to printmaking when I dropped out. Lately, I've been into encaustic painting.\n  ","170322":"\n  google image search honey bee faces and stuff. you know.\n  ","170323":"\n  I do reach out to some people sporadically after a while, and I also have had a few contact me after long periods of time. For the most part, I like hearing from old friends. For those very few relationships that involved abuse or ended extremely badly or what not, yeah, it's triggering and crappy to hear from them- but at the same time, it's a good opportunity to block and move on now that we can kind of DO that. I assume most people probably feel about the same as I do- it's mostly kinda cool to hear from old friends, unless it was a really specific few crap ones.\n  ","170324":"\n  I can't think of anything I've really changed my opinion about completely lately, but I am starting to have some strange doubts and negative gut feelings about a few people in my life including one of my doctors and someone I really cared about so that's left me dealing with a lot of overthinking and opinion examining.\n  ","170325":"\n  anxiousness\n  ","170326":"\n  fall sunsets and the tips of the campfire\n  ","170327":"\n  Not always. I think more it's that we fall in love with the people that reflect traits in ourselves that we either do or do not recognize, but also that have the traits we strive for.\n  ","170328":"\n  Yes I am, and I think it's because it's an anxiety that has controlled parameters, if that makes sense? It's fear I know will (most likely) end after 2 hours and I turn the lights on. I like all kinds. I have a deep fondness and appreciation for unnecessary gore, like in Evil Dead 2 or Dead Alive. I love a good psychological horror like The Shining. I love monsters, slashers, whatever. The Babadook was pretty good. The first Paranormal Activity messed me up reallllly badly. I like horror novels and stuff too, but I honestly just haven't read many past having that same Stephen King and Anne Rice phase everyone had in the early 90s. I don't read as much as I used to these days.\n  \n  As far as other ways, not so much. I have ptsd and generalized anxiety among other things and my adrenaline levels do not regulate themselves very well. If I ever ever even once chose \"flight\" instead of \"fight\" in a panic situation, it might be okay, but I am a fighter lol. I can't go to haunted houses because if I get too startled I just start wailin' on shit. I punched an actor in the jaw when I was like 14 and had to be removed.  Practical jokes against me that involve jump scares and surprises may as well be called \"watch Allison fuckshitup.exe\".\n  ","170329":"\n  I did not do so well :)\n  ","170330":"\n  I've not ever used an alias so much as had different names, nicknames, and screen names\/internet names. I feel like those are different for some reason, I guess because an alias sort of feels like- something you use to hide your identity rather than just being a handle, you know?\n  \n  Anyway.\n  \n  I was an Allison Ledbetter. My childhood nickname was Pinetree, and so I was to some, Pinetree Ledbetter until I was probably 19-ish (well, I'm still Pinetree to some, but that's when I stopped using it so much). I changed my last name to Campbell in 2004. I've been shehitsback most on internet-type things, but have also occasionally used shinobisoup, loglady, dymphna, and owlison.studios. I had planned to make the latter a business name possibly but it really just feels like way too many Allison's are doing similar shit since owls have become so popular so now I'm considering other things.\n  ","170331":"\n  there are a few people I can think of that I'd love to see and give a big hug too.\n  ","170332":"\n  Okay, look.

It irritates when people act like that's weird, or that I *have* to see one or the other. I'm an adult, why is it weird that I don't want to watch movies geared towards children? My childhood wasn't a great one, I have nothing there I want to cling to.\n  \n  I don't think pregnant women should have their own parking spaces and actually it kinda makes me furious.\n  \n  Black jelly beans are my favorite ones. I don't think the yellow Starburst are the worst ones (though I do agree that the pink ones are the best ones).\n  \n  I like Beyond the Thunderdome better than Road Warrior.\n  ","170340":"\n  Why are you asking me this? I genuinely want to know what makes you think I care to do any of these things. Either you are a prolific questioner here (but only on this particular topic), or there are at least a handful of you coming at me with the exact same or similar question on a regular basis.

You're still a ridiculous person asking weird shit of strangers on the internet, regardless.\n  ","170341":"\n  I'm not a picky eater taste-wise, but I have some food sensitivities and allergies that make me feel like I'm picky sometimes. The only thing I can think of right now that I absolutely don't like are bell peppers. Things that my body doesn't like that otherwise I would eat without a problem are squash of any type, mangoes, kiwis, bananas, cauliflower, and shellfish. I still eat most of those things in small amounts occasionally (except the mangoes, can't fuck with those even in small amounts please don't use this information and kill me with mangoes I do take an anti-histamine daily so I'd probably have enough time to get to the ER but I'd be very angry).\n  ","170342":"\n  When I first read about it I cried.

I wish I knew more about Eastern art, art by women, or art from non-white countries, and I'm sure their world history gets ignored in Western teachings as well.

That was about 9 months ago.  I'm not sure what my first non-QotD question was, the first 10 or so questions I answered could be anon or could be QotD it's hard to tell.\n  ","170364":"\n  I went on a cruise to the Bahamas back in 2005 or 06\n  ","170365":"\n  Probably only if I was able to travel in and out daily. I don't like the idea of sleeping in a crowded area, I would feel too vulnerable. Also, I have some contamination issues due to OCD so being in a crowd of dirty people isn't something I feel super comfortable about. I enjoy festivals\/cons\/expos sometimes, but only when I am able to get out and away when I need it.\n  ","170366":"\n  Apparently even when you block someone, you can still see them in your news feed when a friend favorites their answers.

Shyness, preference for non-biased answers, etc.\n  \n  Here's the thing. It's not my fucking responsibility to change because of abuse.

There's a chance that I'd still be allowed some court favor as a Plantagenet descendant, possibly I'd be able to paint under a pseudonym or something with the right connections.\n  ","170372":"\n  I'd love to say something more than \"survival\" but so far, the best thing I've done is be alive despite health and mental illnesses' efforts to take me down. I've managed to survive long enough to find my creative second-wind. Better things are on the horizon.\n  ","170373":"\n  Somebody with a ton of survival skills and experience because I will probably not do to well on my own at least at first. Barring that, someone incredibly high-profile like Beyonce or someone so that I'd know people are out there looking really hard for us.\n  ","170374":"\n  my feeder birds and squirrels keep me entertained on the day-to-day, but nothing is more calming and renewing that a walk in the forest or by the ocean.\n  ","170375":"\n  What if the tea you are currently drinking is poisoned?\n  \n  Then I guess goodbye cruel world because it's delicious.\n  ","170376":"\n  I'm not really sure that I can pinpoint specific traits past obvious ones like \"be kind to other people and animals\" or \"don't be a complete douche canoe\", I rely on gut feelings about people very heavily so you could be the most perfect match for me ever on paper but not pass the instinctual connection possibility test, or the other way around.\n  ","170377":"\n  Bad puns, dad jokes, and this .gif\n  ","170378":"\n  I knew what you meant the first time, anon, but you're being gross so I responded how I wanted.

Mental health has never really been something that any of my previous employers understood well at the time, with the exception of one shop owner way back when I was in college who was way nicer to me than he should have been because I was a terrible employee lol.

The art is mostly a sort of painterly pixel style with the exception of the in-game cards, which are a little more detailed.\n  \n  When I do art for myself, generally it's either just doodling on my tablet or encaustic painting, which is a painting type that uses pigmented wax and can be easily carved into and molded as well as used as a traditional paint.

That's not exactly valuable information, but it's the lesson I've learned the most frequently and the lesson that I'm still always surprised to learn :P\n  ","170389":"\n  I live near Portland, OR, and we have 4 seasons but 3 of those seasons *usually* include light rain (the past year or so have been unusually dry). Summers are beautiful, Sunny, and mild (generally high in the upper 80s F, lows in the 60s F), and everything is green and ripe and amazing.  Spring and Fall are cool, staying between 50 and 70 F usually, but Fall still holds on to that sun for a while if it can while Spring rains nearly constantly. Winter is cold but not extremely cold, with very little snow (though the mountains are heavily snowed on).  I love the climate here.\n  ","170390":"\n  To be honest I'm not sure what is being recognized or not ever. I feel like my sources are all pretty biased, and I'm not the sort of person who always keeps up on the news. Sometimes I do. If I read something and want to know more about it, etc. But I have no idea what the general media puts out there. I hope that #blacklivesmatter is getting the attention it deserves outside of my social media circles.\n  ","170391":"\n  Everything I take or use for medical purposes is prescribed or recommended by one of my team of doctors. This includes prescription drugs, prescription vitamins, over the counter drugs, over the counter vitamins, and cannabis.\n  \n  I don't mess with anything past that, unless things like diffusing oils because the smell of certain things helps me feel calm counts- but I don't really see that as a treatment for anything, just something nice I do for my personal self care.\n  ","170392":"\n  Anyone \"could\" get offended by anything, but in this situation, particularly in America and what has been happening with police brutality\/militarization and the extremely high amount of black people being killed by the police, those offended other races can just sit the hell down and get over themselves. Everyone's life matters, but RIGHT NOW, black lives need to matter more because the way things look, they surely don't matter to the police.\n  ","170393":"\n  They are a bit bigger,hardier, and much sweeter. At least, compared to the blackberries I grew up with in Virginia, which were generally of the boysenberry type and were smaller, darker, and more tart.\n  ","170394":"\n  gosh indeed.\n  ","170395":"\n  I'm gonna tell her unless you promise to stop trying to bait women you don't know into talking about your weird fetish shit anonymously on the internet\n  ","170396":"\n  tell your mom\n  ","170397":"\n  Marionberries, backyard critters, and  Walla Walla onions are tied for favorite.\n  ","170398":"\n  I swallowed my anger and hurt feelings with a friend today because I realized that even though my feelings were still pretty messed up, his past couple of days have been pretty terrible and it would be too much to pile my shit on him too.

Generally once that magma starts roiling it's explode or die trying.\n  ","170399":"\n  I keep telling myself I'm going to stick to a regular yoga routine but that never seems to happen.\n  ","170400":"\n  Nah, not really.\n  ","170401":"\n  It really depends on the person and the relationship. I've gone both ways.\n  ","170402":"\n  Yeah, I think it's just part of being a decent human being to not intentionally offend others. It aggravates the hell out of me when someone tells me to \"choose not to be offended\" or something when I am riled up, I'm not the one who went out of their way to be rude\/cruel. That said, I think it's pretty human to fuck up sometimes.\n  ","170403":"\n  Pretty well, for now. Every once in a while I surprise myself.\n  ","170404":"\n  play video games\n  ","170405":"\n  an owl with rad sunglasses flippin' everyone off before riding into the sunset\n  ","170406":"\n  I have changed so much over the last year in so many ways that I don't know where to begin listing.\n  \n  A year and a half of medication switching brought on about 25 lbs. more than I expected, and for the first time since maybe puberty I've been unfamiliar with my body in some ways- like, I don't translate my size change mentally very well. I feel awkward, and a bit dysphoric. I'm hoping now that I'm on stable medications again, I will be able to lose some of it. Crossing my (swollen) fingers.\n  \n  The reason for the med changes were that my anti-depressants plateaued and before I had a handle on that, I suffered some traumatic medical news that ended up triggering some psychotic behavior (I have OCD and episodic schizophrenia in addition to my major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as post traumatic stress disorder) anyway it's been a hell of a year for me and my psychiatrist because nothing was working and the side effects were all intense and it was just a nightmare of ups and downs.\n  \n  During these sorts of psychological events, you end up needing huge amounts of time to just sort of go inward and re-assess who you are. Or at least, I do. During my inward phase, I admitted to myself that the only reason I've never been able to let myself believe that I am attracted to other genders is because my mother's intense hatred for lesbians has had me terrified to disappoint her in yet another way. Even though I tell myself I don't care about her opinions. Even though I've not spoken to her in years. So, that happened. I came out at age 35 as a bisexual.\n  \n  But right after that, I started having some reoccurring dreams that I've had throughout my life at different stages, in which I dream normal day to day sort of situations for me except I am male. I started really thinking about these and sort of obsessing about and tearing apart my feelings and making comparisons and realized that I really understood where the idea of gender fluidity comes from, because I can see myself at different times relating differently, or on a different \"scale\" to one gender or another throughout my life and I'm comfortable with that. I still feel that I identify as a woman, but I decided to go ahead and change that \"bi\" announcement to \"pansexual\" instead because it felt like a more accurate description of how I newly felt about gender.\n  \n  Also, my hair looks way better than it did last year. So basically, many changes.\n  ","170407":"\n  I have a thing for large, crooked, or otherwise prominent\/interesting noses. My favorite feature of my husband's is his nose-dimple. Like nearly everyone else already answered, also, I do enjoy a good set of \"teeth with personality\". Every time I move and change dentists, I have to explain over again that I'm not interested in braces, I've grown to like my large, crooked teeth. I hate when I see someone restricting their smiles because they are uncomfortable with their teeth, it makes me want to just be nice to them and tell them dumb jokes forever until they have a good open-mouthed toothy smile.\n  ","170408":"\n  I must not follow a lot of dramatic people, I didn't realize that there was drama\n  ","170409":"\n  hmmmmmm- there are so many good breads and cheeses. Breads and cheeses might be among my favorite things. Today I feel like a good hearty multi-grain with maybe some muenster cheese slices would be pretty perfect.\n  ","170410":"\n  the people who put up with my shit\n  ","170411":"\n  You didn't ask me about \"lies of omission\" which I'm pretty sure isn't a thing that exists you asked me if omission of truths are the same as lies. I brushed my fucking teeth earlier and that's the truth but if I fail to announce that to you I'm not lying, I'm just not deciding to tell you something. I'm not on this black and white track for lies or truths or whatever anyway bruh so honestly, you're not going to get a good answer out of me, this shit annoys me.\n  ","170412":"\n  Depends on the severity of the omitted truth I guess. Does omitting it cause harm or destroy trust, or is it just omitted because it's not important enough to divulge?\n  ","170413":"\n  Very. If I don't want to answer something, I just delete it.

They're noisy anyway.\n  ","170424":"\n  I'm in my mid 30s with a ton of medical conditions both physical and mental. I don't believe in hiding who I am, so I'm open with those things. I am not especially forward, I'm generally quite calm, but I have an intense anger streak. I like people individually quite a lot but I'm picky about who I will spend my energy on as I do not ever have much of it. I am sick of white cis hetero bro bullshit in a major way.

But then there are also other less obvious things I really wish people would stop asking, like anything involving children or parenting. Please take me the fuck off your mommies lists I am soooo not interested in that mess. Also, the really really tech-y super philosopher 20 paragraph answer required questions aren't really my cup of tea. I visit this site for entertainment in general- whether to ask, read, or answer, and having to write a thesis paper isn't fun or relaxing.\n  \n  I do like silly questions, general questions, hypothetical questoins, questions about myself or my work or interests, etc. Basically anything else aside from the above annoying ones are a-ok.\n  ","170431":"\n  I suppose the most meaningful ones to me are ones about things I consider strengths in myself, because it's especially nice to feel like someone noticed whatever it is I am currently feeling proud of myself for... but all compliments are nice.

I was polite, we were chatting in a friendly manner, everything was going just like a normal transaction, and she mentions in passing that her daughter wants to go to art school. I say \"Oh, that's awesome! I went to art school as well.\" and this previously average polite woman without even changing her facial expression or anything smiles at me and lilts \"Gosh, and look how fucking accomplished you are now, working customer service for a store, and at your age\". I was stunned. I hadn't finished her transaction, so I canceled it and told her to get the fuck out of my store and then took my break.  I didn't stay with the company much longer because I couldn't handle how terrible people can be.\n  ","170448":"\n  My uncle served time for repeat DUIs. I had a friend years ago who went to prison for stealing a stick of deodorant because of the three strike rule and some previous shoplifting or whatever but like, what actually sent him to jail was a stick of deodorant.

As far as headlines, I think I read on the twitter scanner for my city recently that there was a naked dude dancing in an intersection that had to be removed.\n  ","170449":"\n  I'm not really sure what this is\/means.

I try to make reasonable purchases, and I use grocery coupons sometimes, but when I want something enough to buy it I usually just go ahead and buy it or at least budget for its purchase later.\n  ","170451":"\n  I don't feel very romantic lately, and my honeymoon was nearly a dozen years ago and wasn't what dreams were made out of lol.  We only had 2 days off from work, so we ended up just going to Cape Fear, NC to stay on the beach for 2 nights. It was April, and as is typical for April, it was cold and raining the entire time. I had my labret pierced then, but we were so exhausted after the wedding that we slept like the dead and I woke up at some point in pain with my husband's arm thrown over my face while he snored- he tore my piercing. So there was that.

I think this area is affordable. I've lived in places that were way more affordable and way less affordable than here. When I shop I have a bad habit of not price-checking items unless they're incredibly frivolous purchases, so I've not noticed anything in particular. There was definitely a difference between prices of the same items\/at the same stores between the East coast and the West coast, but I expected that.\n  ","170453":"\n  I occasionally have these big ideas for painting series that I end up never finishing (and barely beginning) but they always require research, and every time this happens I tell myself I'm going to go back and learn even more about each of these topics past just what I particularly needed for the paintings and then I never do because of either time restraints, loss of interest, or forgetfulness. So far, these things have included: Gnosticism, mythology concerning Persephone, Native American (North and South) mythology concerning owls, worldwide mythology concerning sasquatch-type creatures, Catholic martyrs and saints who are female, and more!\n  ","170454":"\n  I'm always willing to entertain most ideas at least for a moment, but I can't think of any conspiracy theory in particular that I really subscribe to. I jokingly talk about reptilians and grays and sasquatch and can be a little bit paranoid about the government's extent of power on occasion I guess lol. The most ridiculous conspiracy theories are probably the ones declaring that all of these pop stars are Illuminati.\n  ","170455":"\n  Eh, I'm not really sure what I think about this to be honest. On one hand I can see their point, certainly it seems impossible to us and completely illogical to accept that regular human beings accomplished these things- but on the other hand, who are we to judge what the people of that time are capable of? Why do we always assume that earlier humans were less intelligent than modern man?\n  ","170456":"\n  I do believe in ETs, mainly just because it seems like if life was able to form here on Earth, surely the same could happen on one of the other bazillion planets.

That sort of acts as the command center. From there, I am a list-maker. I have a running shopping list, and when that list is full enough to warrant a trip to the store, then a new list is made in order of the grocery store layout for a more efficient trip. I'm packing for a trip right now, so I have lists of chores that need to be done before we leave, lists of what to pack, lists of items not to forget, lists of chargers and toiletries and things to pick up from the store tomorrow. I have a white board in the kitchen with a cleaning schedule and a magnet marker that I can move down the list to indicate what day of the week it is (and therefore what chores are due). I'm not always the best at keeping up with everything, but it is all fairly organized.\n  ","170464":"\n  It's important for children to have the vocabulary for their own anatomy, and to not feel uncomfortable speaking about it to their caregivers.  I think it's perfectly fine to have funny names for things or whatever, my nephew misheard my sister's lesson on anatomy as a toddler and thought his nipples were \"meatballs\" for a while, which was adorable... however, a kid needs to be able to communicate clearly and with seriousness what their body concerns are whether that's to a doctor or a parent or whatever.\n  ","170465":"\n  I do not. I've been in a monogamous relationship for a dozen years though, so I mean, it can be done. For some, it's enough and they have a partner who provides every single one of their needs and who they provide every need for. For the average human, I think we rely more on small self-made communities to fill out needs whether that's through friendship or flirtations or professional relationships or whatever. I don't see anything wrong with that. I know that with my illnesses, I am often a poor partner and I have asked my husband to please find someone to be close to for his sake and for mine, so I could feel like the guy I love is being fully cared for, but he's not really comfortable with that idea at this time.\n  ","170466":"\n  lol because anything that feels good must be awful. Some people deal in blacks and whites, some people stay in a grey area. When you believe in extremes (Heaven, Hell; God, Satan; Good, Bad) then you feel like everything unexpectedly pleasurable must have an equally terrible counter.\n  ","170467":"\n  I really don't know how to answer tbh. In some ways, yes absolutely it's great that like-minded people can easily meet and safely discuss whatever it is they're into, but then you have shit like child pornographers exchanging footage in chat rooms or whatnot which obviously needs to be broken up. Like everything, the Internet is neither wholly good or bad.\n  ","170468":"\n  No more than they are currently, no. Little kids shouldn't be able to walk into a porn store, but I have nothing against sexually explicit materials produced by and for consensual adults existing more or less censorship -free.\n  ","170469":"\n  I don't mind slang, I just don't understand it anymore and I'm now a crochety old lady I guess.\n  \n  I like bright colors and clean lines, but more artsy or kitsch than contemporary. The expressionists are my favorite painters, for the dramatic lines and focus on color and emotion. I enjoy when personality comes out in imperfect, bright, bold ways whether it's art, fashion, or design.\n  ","170470":"\n  there have been times where less favorable slang terms have been used in private conversation with a partner and it's made me feel a bit devalued, I guess. But in general, I love slang, the worse the better.\n  ","170471":"\n  I will not have children. I was uncomfortable talking about these things with my mom, but luckily I didn't have to often since mostly when these things came up it meant a trip to the library and me looking shit up on my own.\n  ","170472":"\n  I'm too old to know exactly what this means. I assume it's shortened from \"aesthetically pleasing\"  but I never know what the fuck people are trying to say using the term \"aesthetic\" on tumblr or whatever. Half the time \"aesthetic\" just means \"I'm going to take pictures of my sanrio lipgloss next to some 90s clip art\"\n  \n  So I dunno. What's my style? What do I find attractive? How do I prefer to decorate interiors? What art do I find visually pleasing? Etc.?

Is this in like, a shitty MRA guide on how to bait feminists or something?\n  ","170478":"\n  it was between 2-3 days. I was a sophomore in college, and it was portfolio week which is like, finals week for art school, and I had several part time jobs and some major psychological issues happening and I just didn't have time to sleep. I ended up drinking so much coffee towards the end that I walked to work that final morning and barfed all over the front stoop when I got there. Thankfully, my boss told me to go home and nap, so I was able to shower, get a 4 hour nap, and ace my portfolio reviews.\n  ","170479":"\n  We went to Vegas 4 years ago, that was a really great time. It was probably the biggest vacation we've been on since we've been married. We enjoyed last New Year's in Lake Tahoe, I won tickets to a music festival there. We go on little weekend trips occasionally. I dunno. Every trip has it's pros and cons, and I always enjoy seeing new places.\n  ","170480":"\n  Vogons\n  ","170481":"\n  Any time I'm in the woods or on a long car ride with Jon with good music on the car stereo or lost in my work on a drawing or painting\n  ","170482":"\n  Yeah, I'm pretty nerdy. I own a lot of game and pop-culture-y tee shirts. I wear retro glasses. I adore mary jane style shoes and brightly colored sneakers. I attend gaming conventions, comic conventions, etc. But I'm really not into any of the fandoms at all. People have gotten so - I don't even know how to describe it. \"Involved\". \"rabid\". I just like to enjoy things at my pace, I don't have any desire to learn every trivia fact about every single episode of a thing or whatever, you know what I mean?\n  ","170483":"\n  I don't think I'm a very romantic person, but I'm sure there are certain people who would disagree with me on that. I guess there has to be a very specific bond and I have to be in a very specific mood for me to be romantic. Mostly, I'm more just like, a comfortable pal who sometimes is kinda sexy. lol. I'm never comfortable talking about things like this, it leads to too many weird anons.\n  ","170484":"\n  I've said it before, but it never actually means that. It's just a polite way to say \"I don't want to discuss this with you\". Most people care about at least an issue or two, but for a lot of us, debating it just leads to anger and frustration and it's just not something we like to discuss with certain people or even just people outside of our immediate comfort zone.\n  ","170485":"\n  Just had a barbacoa burrito bowl from Chipotle, that was pretty hearty.\n  ","170486":"\n  I quit smoking cigarettes 5 years ago, after smoking for 15 years. It was hard, but my insurance company provided a coach and a gift card reward after 6 months smoke-free so I did it and never went back.

I've not been having the best relationship with myself lately. Maybe this exercise will help.\n  \n  1. I love that I'm someone that people in my life feel comfortable talking to when they're in need. I often feel very awkward and stand-offish, but I know that when someone is in crisis and they come to me they came to me because I am a comforting presence. I want to be\/like to be a comfort to people I care about when I am able.\n  \n  2. I love that when things get really bad- scary bad- something within me usually clicks for long enough to produce the courage I need to get through it.  In the face of pain and danger I have always had that strong inner me light up and take charge.\n  \n  3. I love that animals like me.\n  ","170492":"\n  gosh that's probably it thanks for putting me in my place anon\n  \n  *eyes roll into the back of my head*\n  ","170493":"\n  Video games, drawing, knitting- I guess those are the big three, though to be honest I've not really had much time or energy for any of them recreationally lately.\n  ","170494":"\n  I actually really liked one ICP song way back in like, 1997, and only because I was going through a Mr. Bungle\/Lords of Acid\/Look at me, I'm so shocking and badass phase at the time ( I was 17) and then this stupid fucking band dressed like goth clowns with a trailer park following shows up out of nowhere and has this ridiculous, offensive on a million levels dating game song (The Neden Game) and I thought it was hi-lar-ious.\n  ","170495":"\n  A part of me thinks I would be a fighter or a revolutionary, but ON the run, so that I could best guide others to safety, because to be perfectly honest- and this is some high level woo woo shit here- \"it was foretold\".  I once worked with a self-proclaimed shaman and he and his wife both convinced themselves that I would be leading people to safety after war devastated our country or some apocalyptic event or some mess. This was in like, 1996-1998, so I wasn't even out of high school yet. They were dead serious though, and treated me like a fucking unicorn.\n  \n  In actuality, I'd probably end up breaking down, going catatonic, and having to be cared for.\n  ","170496":"\n  Had to selfie it in parts. my current favorite outfit is this floral skater dress with teal and red Saucony sneakers, big gold hoop earrings, a layered necklace, a big owl ring, and ruffled pink and yellow socks.\n  ","170497":"\n  I took piano lessons as a kid and tried to learn guitar twice as a young adult but the problem each time was my tiny baby hands that can't stretch a full octave or reach all of the strings comfortably. I'm really honestly considering learning to play the ukulele because I think it would suit my small hands.\n  ","170498":"\n  Currently, probably Tarboush on SE Hawthorne in Portland. Everyone around here seems to have really strong opinions about Lebanese food and I haven't tried some of the more popular places, but having grown up with Lebanese food, I can say that this tiny little restaurant has the most authentic Lebanese food I've had anywhere besides my Aunt Alice's kitchen.\n  ","170499":"\n  I've been having a hard time coming up with an answer for this because I guess at this stage of my life I'm just not very romantic- but then I remembered our hamster Kostya.\n  \n  About 6 years ago, I found a hamster running away from a feral cat near the apartment dumpster and took him in. I had 3 cats at the time, so I just kept a watch on things and kept his cage in a very secure place.\n  \n  After a while, I noticed that during \"ball time\" where I let him run around the living room in his plastic ball while Jon and I sat on the sofa, he would go look for my cat Rin every single time.\n  \n  I started paying more attention and apparently Rin and Kostya had a really close bond. She checked up on him frequently, kept the other cats away, liked to \"cuddle\" while he was in his ball, it was adorable\n  \n  Then, as hamsters do, he died. He died in my hands, we had no idea how old he was when we found him but his teeth were very long, so I'm sure it was just the end. He was wheezing and pooping and as I held him and cleaned him he just stopped being alive.\n  \n  Rin mourned for months. Slept curled up in the exact place his cage had been. Perked up and investigated anything that still had a lingering smell of him. It was heartbreaking. Rin really really loved that hamster.\n  ","170500":"\n  I would take ayahuasca, but here in my home since I'm not going to be punished for having illegal and super hard to get black market drugs here because the idea of going to a retreat somewhere I'm not familiar with skeeves me out. I really want the experience of the drug, but not the experience of the tourist trade.\n  ","170501":"\n  Hi Leigh :) I'm skipping 1 and 2 this time (not reading anything currently; infertile), but lemme take a shot at 3 here.\n  \n  I'm not sure what a fulfilled life entails, or even where the lines would be drawn on material things if it was attainable. I would assume free-time is the most important part of having a fulfilled life, so the bare minimum amount of things I could handle and still feel like my entire life wasn't dedicated to chores and drudgery would be: running water\/modern plumbing, modern kitchen options (stove, microwave, fridge, freezer,  coffee maker, dishes\/flatware\/glassware\/cookware seem like ones I would be frustrated to be without), internet access and a way to access it, and of course an adequate amount of food, proper shelter, a place to rest, and basic toiletries.\n  \n  I guess then the extras I feel are fundamental to my lifestyle would be convenience foods, decent computer set up and fast internet, tools for art, small appliances (electric griddle, toaster, crock pot), specialty skin care products and make up and things like that rather than the basics, and decorative and comfort items for my home. I'm sure I'm missing a lot.\n  ","170502":"\n  I grew up with hunters and continue to have friends who hunt for sport. When it's done legally, within specific times and areas, and only for specific game that is over-populated and can be used for food, then I'm all for it. If it's some rich dude breaking laws in order to thrill-kill an endangered animal, then nah, fuck that noise.\n  ","170503":"\n  I do enjoy reading, but I almost never read anything longer than an article these days. I like mostly fiction, particularly the \"classics\", historical fiction, occasionally fantasy or horror when I do read. My favorite book is Demien by Hermann Hesse, just because it's very short and emotional and has meant a lot of different things to me over the years. I like a lot of Hesse's other books as well. The most recent series I've read was a fantasy trilogy that was really good. It's not like, new or anything, but I think it came out in the 90s- anyway the first in the series is Sabriel, I can't remember the offical trilogy name. I think the other books were Liriel and Abhorsen but I don't know if I spelled them right.\n  ","170504":"\n  I could list words I just don't like, but it would be more fun to watch people have to create a new name for a well known object, so I'm going to eliminate the word \"Leg\".\n  ","170505":"\n  I used to always enjoy abstracted figure study type things, but lately when I've drawn for me it's been birds. Specifically the birds that visit my feeders out back.

It does get pretty dusty back there because cat hair, but I try to keep it pretty clean.\n  ","170510":"\n  I guess new experiences motivate me to a small extent, in a vague need for exploration sort of way. Love is always a motivator. Kindness. Being in tune with myself. I think I can be a motivating force, but I think lately I've been a bit too unstable to be more than a small comfort, not much of a motivator.\n  ","170511":"\n  I have no idea, as I have a soft round belly lol.\n  ","170512":"\n  Welcome, Jody\n  ","170513":"\n  Oh, some ridiculous new technology that my husband will have to have and I will only begrudgingly accept.

Assuming that other women will, were, or are trying to conceive is really really ableist, sexist, and transphobic. Some women can not have children. Some women do not want children. It took me 6 years of therapy to come to terms with my infertility and every time a stranger brings it up casually like it's \"just a girl thang\" I kinda want to throw up.\n  ","170518":"\n  I have no idea.

Probably still was though. :P\n  ","170519":"\n  I've never owned, but I've rented a ton. There have been 9 apartments in the past 15 years. I don't have a tough time nowadays. At first it was terrifying trying to get everything in order, and before I got married dealing with roommates and all of that. Now it's just like - oh shit, we've gotta move for my husband's job in two weeks, time to get rolling. I use apartment listings online, then check google for neighborhood statistics, then check for reviews on apartmentratings.com. If I can find one that meets my needs, is in a good neighborhood, and has good reviews, then I call and reserve an apartment. Money is always an issue of course, but we've been lucky enough to have moving allowances from my husband's job a couple of times or had savings set aside for deposits and such so far.\n  ","170520":"\n  I have a deep love of slang and catch phrases, so my favorite sayings changes pretty often.

It wasn't worth our ridiculous co-pay at the time for me to bother with X-rays when unless I punctured an organ or something bonkers the result was going to be \"rest and try not to do anything that might prevent things from heal correctly\" no matter what.

Some people are smart in a \"has collected a ton of knowledge and applies that to their lives\" way, some people are smart in a \"used logic and creativity to survive\" way, etc.\n  \n  I don't know what I possess, really. The reason I was studied as a kid was because my IQ was high but my problem solving didn't follow the same patterns as other people with similarly high IQs.

The internet tests I've taken have varied wildly numerically but still placed me in a \"super genius\" or \"genius\" range.\n  \n  Nah, I don't think the online tests are accurate, but not just because they're online tests- I think IQ is a pretty inaccurate measurement of intelligence.\n  ","170549":"\n  I think I give pretty good advice- I'm absolutely terrible at TAKING good advice though.\n  ","170550":"\n  I try not to cuss around little kids or my in-laws or whatever but yeah, I've got a potty mouth.

Why would I love you?\n  ","170556":"\n  I don't know who you are\n  ","170557":"\n  well this is quite awkward, anon\n  ","170558":"\n  well thank you.\n  ","170559":"\n  hi\n  ","170560":"\n  this one's pretty cool\n  \n  (source:\n  \n   https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/zombieite\/15379457616)\n  \n","170561":"\n  I had a really great weekend overall, at least as far as my weekends generally go. heard from some old friends and some new friends, got some work done, (mostly) stayed above my anxiety, so it was pretty good. Don't really have one \"best thing\" though.\n  ","170562":"\n  hang out on the internetz and look at dumb memes together\n  ","170563":"\n  I don't know that I could pick just one person. I need so many people lately.\n  ","170564":"\n  I ate breakfast food and a slice of pie for dinner at a local diner with my husband, smoked some platinum girl scout cookie to ease some ovary pain I'm having, and now I'm catching up on the internet :)\n  ","170565":"\n  My favorite book is Demian by Hermann Hesse, and in the middle part of the book, the lead character meets a young musician and philosopher named Pistorius who teaches him that \"every man's true calling is only to arrive at himself\". I consider that a lot, especially lately as I've been struggling back up from a fall into the pit of trauma memories, depression, and anxiety-fueled issues. You learn so much about yourself in those sorts of situations, sometimes it's even quite shocking. Arriving at the doorstep of Who You Really Are and being comfortable with who you see when the door opens is something a lot of people shy away from doing or are unable to do, but it's what we're meant to do. Or something. I am so tired right now.\n  ","170566":"\n  Music is quite important to me, but I'm no music snob, and I don't like or dislike people based on their music preferences. Music is more of a personal enjoyment thing, and I've always connected certain times of my life with certain mixes of bands. I don't know that I could pick one most meaningful musician. I don't think I could even pick one musician per life stage that was more meaningful than others. It's about emotion and mood and memory and it's more of a living playlist that is my \"favorite\" rather than any one part of that.\n  ","170567":"\n  I really kinda just enjoy letting travel situations happen as they happen, without a specific goal. Like, I won a trip to Lake Tahoe last Winter, and we had an amazing time but I would never have considered Tahoe a place I especially wanted to visit prior to that. We wanted to see more of the US, and when my husband relocated from VA to WA, we got to drive from ocean to ocean practically and see a huge chunk of states. My husband won a week in Vegas once, and though we don't really drink or gamble we had a great time. Travel just sort of happens for us. We only really plan local-ish things, day trips and the like. I suppose part of me wants to go to Brazil because of some family history, and England, but not so much that I'd say it's something I consider extremely meaningful.\n  ","170568":"\n  I have been in a couple, and they were the sort of drunken biker bar bathroom brawls that don't really have a winner (but sure, I totally won). Past that (my early 20's were a pile of shit), the only fights I've been in were having a knife pulled on me in middle school by Michelle Matthews in the art closet with her two sidekicks backing her up and being so full of herself that she didn't notice when I took the knife out of her hand and then threatened THEM with it (and then tattled 'cause, nerd), a few situations in elementary school where girls would tell me to meet after school to fight and then I'd show up and no one would be there (but of course they told everyone they kicked my ass the next day), and a pretty terrible relationship where I was physically and sexually abused and he was an enormous fucking German I couldn't fight back against.\n  ","170569":"\n  a pair of lime green running shorts and a grey tank top with bugs on it.\n  ","170570":"\n  I love the idea of a seed-vault- the Many Mothers with their bag of seeds are one of my favorite parts of the new Mad Max movie,  and here in Portland, we have a rose test garden that was created similarly to protect hybrid and rare European species of rose during World War I in case of destruction. I feel like probably we already have genome data on file somewhere secretly for as many species as they've been able to recently document, it just seems like the sort of thing SOME govt. or another would have started on by now, right? shrug. Maybe I expect too much from our governments' secret programs lol.\n  ","170571":"\n  Oh, plenty of it is appealing. I used to be quite a heavy drinker in my early 20s. I love fru-fru cocktails and a good cider- but what I don't like is the sick, queasy feeling that comes with drinking, or the panic when I can't operate at my full capacity. I prefer smoking weed, where I can control my state of mind a bit better and not feel sick to my stomach a few hours later.\n  ","170572":"\n  I don't really know. I'm a middle-income college drop out who doesn't drink, but it has nothing to do with my education level or income...I can afford to drink, but I choose not to. I think it's kinda gross. I know people who drink a lot from low income, low education situations as well as the opposite. shrug.\n  ","170573":"\n  I just want to live. Some days I don't feel like I'm going to for very much longer.\n  ","170574":"\n  Eh, he's not an asshat he's important to me but I just get to a point where if one more unsolicited conflicting opinion is mansplained to me I want to start reaching into peoples faces and yanking eyeballs out.\n  ","170575":"\n  Cecil the Lions fucking head.\n  ","170576":"\n  Well, I reckon it depends on if they have the same senses as us, or at least sound and touch. I feel like being able to enjoy music, even unfamiliar music on weird instruments, would transfer over to alien species if they were able to hear\/feel it in a similar capacity as we can, or even in a different capacity but one that allowed for at least recognizing patterns and finding enjoyment in that- after all, plants can enjoy music according to studies, so why not aliens?\n  ","170577":"\n  Kind of. I am someone who definitely relies on gut reactions and first impressions when it comes to other people nowadays, which does mean that there are people I've come across that I've instantly felt a connection to or had emotions for one way or another. Maybe not anything as strong as love? Close. A definite precursor to love.\n  ","170578":"\n  This time of year, I open the blinds a little bit so that fresh air can blow in while we sleep.\n  ","170579":"\n  I'm allergic to penicillin, kiwis, mangoes, pet dander, most grass and tree pollens, and basically anything that brushes up against my skin (including wind) because I have this condition called dermatographism where my skin produces too much histamine when it's triggered- and it's triggered by anxiety, and my anxiety is high, so I have to take an anti-histamine every morning or else the sleeve of my shirt will cause a chain reaction ending with my arms and legs covered in welts or something equally ridiculous and annoying.\n  ","170580":"\n  It feels like most of the people I talk to for a lengthy amount of time are the sort of people you just sort of have this on-going conversation with anywhere from few minute to few day pauses, you know? Like I don't remember one especially long recent conversation, but I feel like I've been in very long ongoing conversations with some people for years.\n  ","170581":"\n  I think it's pretty common for not everyone to get along all the time, like having that uncle that irritates you or being angry at a sibling for a bit, but I have a mother and a brother I haven't spoken to or seen in over 3 years and I don't think that's common. I attempted to befriend my brother's girlfriend on social media so that I could at least have some sort of relationship with my newborn niece but that ended quickly- so I have a niece I'll probably never know now, too, which I hope is uncommon because it sucks.\n  ","170582":"\n  Me, but with better metabolism and more motivation. And flight.\n  ","170583":"\n  One of my cats was in power-cleaning mode and tilted right off the side of the chair she was sitting on after an especially dramatic swipe behind her ears (she's fine)\n  ","170584":"\n  We mostly hate each other and barely speak.\n  ","170585":"\n  My ideal pizza would have black olives, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and anchovies- but honestly I'll eat and enjoy most toppings as long as there aren't bell peppers (the taste just overwhelms the whole pizza for me) and I really have to be in a specific mood for pineapple\n  ","170586":"\n  Nah and I assume I never will- but I've definitely seen some good places for him to live if he does live around here :)  Sometimes I send out a mental \"hey what's up\" when I'm in the woods just in case lol.\n  ","170587":"\n  Nah. Maybe Internet-Sorta-Known-But-Respected-And-Left-Alone-From-Most-Of-The-Negativity-That-Comes-With-Being-Internet-Famous-And-Female. That would be okay.\n  ","170588":"\n  Maru all day every day. I would trade two of my cats for one Maru. Just kidding. Maybe.\n  ","170589":"\n  I'm pretty convinced Hillary's a Reptilian.\n  ","170590":"\n  I was so lucky in the teacher lottery. I can't think of a single one that made the most impact because so many did, and in positive ways (I did have one especially shitty one, but boo on her). My first grade teacher Mrs. Smith fought to get me into the gifted program because even though my IQ is wayyyyy up there my mother was a hard sell on anything that meant she might have to put more effort in as a parental figure. Because of Mrs. Smith, I was able to get an education more catered to my abilities. From there, I had mostly good teachers, a few stand-outs (Mrs. Sutton was a science teacher in middle school, Mrs. French was a liberal arts teacher in 6th grade), until high school when I began attending governor's school for the arts, and spend the next 4 years with a group of amazing teachers with three particularly who really saw into me and had hearts big enough to offer me the support and structure I desperately needed (Virginia Van Horn, Peter Thurston, Jon Petruchyk). From there, it was college, with another two teachers who really went the distance (Thorpe Feidt and Jen Hilton). I kept in touch sporadically with Thorpe,a few years with Peter and Jen, but not in ages- Jon sadly has passed, I'm friends with Virginia on facebook in the same aquaintance-y way I am with a lot of other people I wish I had stayed more \"in-touch\" with.  However, they all were so important to me at the times they were in my life, and I owe a lot to each of them.\n  ","170591":"\n  \"men's rights\" is nothing\n  ","170592":"\n  As someone who depends very heavily on medications in order to live a relatively \"normal\" life, I can be pretty pro-medication. HOWEVER. I've also spent years trying to find the right medication combinations to treat my illnesses (and am still trying to sort out a good anti-anxiety) so I'm well aware how scary and over-the-top some of the pills and side effects can be. Not every prescription medication is created equal, and many can be quite dangerous. Does that negate their necessity? Nah. It just sucks that there's such a wide variance of things that can go wrong when you really need something to go right. As for pharmaceutical companies, I think it really depends on the doctor\/hospital. When I lived on the East coast, I felt like more of my doctors were just throwing whatever cool new pill they were being sold on by reps that day at me, and it really sucked. I don't know if I just had particularly shitty doctors, or if they were just overworked, or what. Since moving here, I've noticed that my doctors have really been very good about staying up to date on research and a more holistic approach (i.e.- \"this pill might help, but it will aggravate this other ailment, so it's not going to be a good match\" instead of just prescribing whatever without worrying about how it'll affect everything else) so I don't feel like pill companies have as much of an influence here. (re-answered to correct a typo)\n  ","170593":"\n  my favorite coffee mug was clean and ready to use this morning\n  ","170594":"\n  It really depends on the situation and how I'm feeling, to be honest...and whether or not there are \"victims\" resulting from the moral dilemma. I do my best not to hurt others. I care a lot less about things that don't affect other people.\n  ","170595":"\n  Pie is superior\n  ","170596":"\n  Occasionally. I usually order a subway club with the bread with cheese on it, pepper jack cheese, spinach, pickles, double black olives, tomato, and the chipotle mayo.\n  ","170597":"\n  soft tacos\n  ","170598":"\n  I suppose you're right. Probably also a toothbrush would be good. So- a good knife, a toothbrush, and 3 towels.\n  ","170599":"\n  Five towels\n  ","170600":"\n  I have hugged a cow and if there was a nice cow here looking huggable I might hug a cow again\n  ","170601":"\n  I'm sure I would have, but in ways other than community, culture, language, I'm not sure how. I guess if my family was different than my current one there would be some major changes. My mom and her brother and parents lived in Brazil for a decade before moving back to the states, and my stepmother lived in Japan as a child so I feel like I've been raised with at least some global awareness which maybe would be more pronounced if I grew up somewhere other than America.\n  ","170602":"\n  alright kids, I'm just going to block any further fetish questioners. GTFO of here with this shit day in and day out. Would you want your wife or mother or daughter to have to fucking CONSTANTLY be questioned by shitstain anons about their disgusting fetish shit every time they log online? Stop being a horrible person.\n  ","170603":"\n  I don't normally care too much about presidential elections, to be honest. I always vote, and I generally like one candidate more than the others, but I've never registered as a party member or anything. I do like Bernie Sanders though. Recently I received a survey in the mail from the Democratic party and I filled out the bits about my thoughts on certain platform issues, but I left the ones about my personal involvement with the party blank because I've never identified as a Dem and haven't voted for a Democratic president I don't think ever. I did write across the top in bold though that although I don't care for the party, I really liked Bernie so yay.\n  ","170604":"\n  I have to be very careful about questioning my truths and making sure that I am not lying to myself or falling into a delusional cycle pretty vigilantly because of my tendency to fall into schizoaffective behaviors in times of depression and anxiety. It's a weakness that many have abused me with- it's super easy to gaslight someone and diminish their self-worth when they already question literally everything.\n  ","170605":"\n  I feel like I don't really watch a lot of tv compared to most people, and yet I had like, a dozen immediate responses fly into mind when I read this question. I guess I'm more of a tv junky than I thought. My all-time favorite shows are Twin Peaks, M*A*S*H, the Muppet Show, Nip\/Tuck, Northern Exposure, X-files. Lately, I've really enjoyed OITNB, Steven Universe, Bob's Burgers, Fresh of the Boat.\n  ","170606":"\n  I always loved late Summer and early Fall the best, but as I've gotten older and with all of the medications I'm on I can't handle the heat like I used to. I still hate the cold, but I don't love the hot weather so much anymore either.\n  "}}
