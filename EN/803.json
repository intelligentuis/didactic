Nothing better than a chill weekend, right? \u208a\u02da.\u0f04 I'm spending mine just the same.\n  \n  Well, kinda. I had a few chore type things to finish today, and I do have a few minuscule tasks to do while I'm out tomorrow. And I might also bathe the dogs some time after that! But otherwise I'm doing myself a favor and relaxing.\n  \n  Well that's my weekend in a nutshell. Have you got any plans for yours?\n  ","861606":"\n  Oh no it's not really about spoilers or anything for me, it's basically just a personal nitpick with watching things \"authentically\". Like uhh in the intended order? If that makes sense? It kind of sounds like I'm describing avoiding spoilers KFJFFNNR but. Idk how to explain it \ud83d\ude02\n  \n  Also I just looked up where to watch it! It appears as though it used to be on Netflix, since there's a title webpage for it. But it leads to an error. I might be able to watch it on prime video, since I have a free prime membership. But I'm not sure since I don't really use Amazon typically to begin with. I'll find it somehow either way.\n  ","861607":"\n  I'm not too bad, thank you for asking! How about yourself? \ud83c\udf1f\n  ","861608":"\n  I think I'd rather watch it when it comes up in the movie. :3 I'm gonna look up where I can watch it! I really appreciate the rec, I don't watch many movies so it's always good to have pointers of what to watch.\n  ","861609":"\n  I would love to fill a swimming pool with plastic (or foam) balls, like a ball pit! I've always wanted to play in a ball pit; I never got the chance as a kid. But it'd be cool to have a gigantic ball pit.\n  ","861610":"\n  That was a wild story from start to finish \ud83d\ude33 Also that's an interesting genre mashup. Is it an older movie? I swear I've never heard of it because I feel like if I did I'd at least remember that \ud83d\ude02\n  ","861611":"\n  Yep! I've played 2 and 3 the most, I think. But I have also played 4 a little bit. The original Sims title, however, is too much of a pain for me to sit and play \ud83d\ude2d\n  ","861612":"\n  AAA thank you sm!!

It's how weak we become to everything as we age that scares me.\n  ","861620":"\n  I don't really drink, but even if I did I wouldn't go for it. Beer just tastes rancid imo.\n  ","861621":"\n  My absolute dream job is to work as a freelance artist.\n  ","861622":"\n  I really wish k\u00a1nk obsessed anons wouldn't talk to strangers as if everyone is just blatantly into their k\u00a1nk. Seriously, stop pushing this sh\u00a1t on other people. I'm not entertaining your wack\u0105ss k\u00a1nk!\n  ","861623":"\n  I LOVE STAIRS!! So long as I'm not carrying a bunch of stuff up 'em. I like to do this lil thing where I skip \/ hop up steps. I skip a stair in between as I dash upwards. It's like a fun little mini game!! Plus it works out the thighs and ham strings, so why not?\n  ","861624":"\n  No. Even when I'm sick, how disgusted I am by puke makes my body lock up and try to stop it. I couldn't physically induce it even if I wanted to \u2014 which I *do not*.\n  ","861625":"\n  When I see an answer I really like, I'll give rewards!\n  ","861626":"\n  I'll like the posts I like the answers to, when I see them! I don't always make time to look at answers though, which I've been trying to work on this last week.\n  ","861627":"\n  Usually I read answers via my notifications and the feed, not necessarily going after any specific users. I only follow people whose answers I wanna see anyways.\n  ","861628":"\n  Both are really pretty colors, and I love both! But I'd have to go for pink.\n  ","861629":"\n  Dump him.\n  ","861630":"\n  There's almost nothing more relaxing to me than a hot cup of mint tea!\n  ","861631":"\n  I don't have any primary sources of inspiration currently, in terms of specific people. But there is plenty of things I see from my day to day life that fill me with inspiration! Photography and art, primarily.\n  ","861632":"\n  I dislike spicy food! I've always wanted to be able to handle spicy foods, but unfortunately they don't do me any good.\n  ","861633":"\n  I never left work to \"go back\" in the first place unfortunately. \ud83d\ude1e I've been working through this whole pandemic. My habits as a germophobe have been keeping me in good health!\n  ","861634":"\n  No, I never have!\n  ","861635":"\n  Hearing distant noises on an otherwise silent night. At about half past midnight last night, there was some really unsettling noises off in the distance that are hard to describe.\n  \n  There was a couple of really heavy slams, and for the next ten minutes on and off there was uhh,, screeching?? It was really high pitched. It all sounded so far off that we couldn't tell which direction it was coming from. And eventually, everything fell silent.\n  ","861636":"\n  Thank you sm!! Bless you for always being around to spread positivity. You deserve all of the light you shine to be reflected right back. Have a wonderful Friday and a great weekend! Stay safe and in good health. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf80\n  ","861637":"\n  NO :( and it makes me so fckin upset because I really wanted to like it. Fruits, spices, what's not to like..?\n  \n  It Tastes Gawd Awful. AWFUL. I have tried a few different kinds but I gave up. They taste wack asf to me. I don't really even like alcohol to begin with though, so that may also be part of it. I don't really drink.\n  ","861638":"\n  Nope. Actually I'm waiting to text my ex this weekend to see if I can drop his stuff off lmao. So to reiterate euuuuh.. nope!\n  ","861639":"\n  Much, MUCH too expensive. New consoles have been \"too expensive\" for generations now, in my eyes. And all of that cost for significantly weaker hardware and software. And neither of those are exactly modifiable.\n  \n  A good gaming PC has quite the expense to swallow, sure. But I'd much rather set myself up on a payment plan for a beefy upgradable pre-build (or heII just the parts for building my own). It's better than tossing $500 out the window on something that will continually lose usability once the next one comes out.\n  \n  A good gaming PC (and one with upgradable parts) promises support for games of the past, present, and future. I'll take that over a console any day. It's just so much more worth it!\n  ","861640":"\n  I'M?? \ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc95 Me? Cute? Thank you sm, you have no idea how much this made me smile!\n  \n  Also, I fully support you doing what you're comfortable with. I mean I don't bite or anything, but if you feel more comfortable saying so on anon then I fully understand. \ud83c\udf1f\u2601\ufe0f\ud83d\udc97\n  ","861641":"\n  If I was Santa Claus for a day, I'd want to bring gifts to children in need, who could use some cheer. I would want to bring presents to children's hospitals, as well as to shelters and group homes.\n  ","861642":"\n  While I'm sure plenty of people have given you valid enough reason to feel that way, it's important to not be beside ourselves with anger.\n  \n  You should never let the pain people put you through change the goodness in you. Don't let people of the past dim your light. Don't let negative experiences blind you from the goodness to come!\n  \n  There's plenty of good people out there who aren't \"full of cr\u0105p\", who will care about you with full sincerity. Just because you haven't found them yet, doesn't mean cr\u0105ppy people is all there is. Have hope and patience.\n  ","861643":"\n  I'd vote rose gold. Decorating your room around a special interest is pretty cool, but interests can change! It'd suck to put so much work into redecorating and then eventually not be into the other two anymore. But that's just my two cents!\n  ","861644":"\n  I tend to prefer figuring out things for myself on most things. Because who's best to find a solution to a problem than someone who's standing right in the middle of it, right? But there is times where I have asked for advice and taken it. It really depends on the personal sensitivity of the situation.\n  ","861645":"\n  Not too bad! I feel like the day is flying by, but other than that I'm doing alright. It's been a really good day otherwise so far.\n  ","861646":"\n  idk, I guess you should go ask him\n  ","861647":"\n  I have quite a few! But the top favs are pretty much at a tie between \"angelcore\" and \"webcore\".\n  \n  Since I really can't decide, here's an old web gif of an angel!\n  ","861648":"\n  If I recall, $25 or so with insurance! It's kind of been a while though, so I don't wholly recall.\n  ","861649":"\n  It's nice to hear back from you too!! I've been looking out for your response :3 also NICEEEE! I haven't been on my PC in a minute, so I haven't even touched steam much. I could definitely afford to have some game time.\n  ","861650":"\n  Ice cream cone!! Snow cones are pretty good, but the flavor can tend to run out of it. That can make it hard to finish eating! Also snow cones are the best if eaten before melting. That's awful to a slow eater like me. ( \u0a6d\u232f\u1dc4\u03c9\u232f\u1dc5 ).\uff61\n  ","861651":"\n  I'll typically go for ice cream that's smooth rather than chunky. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE me my cookies and cream ice cream. But I'm usually only craving it when I want something more indulgent. Typically, I prefer the smooth stuff. \ud83c\udf66\n  ","861652":"\n  I've always preferred dogs! I grew up with dogs as pets, and never really had a pet cat before taking care of Salem. I just feel like I'm more used to dogs and their behaviors.\n  ","861653":"\n  idk who this is, I'm so lost \ud83d\ude14\n  ","861654":"\n  I got your other ask about this, but I'm not sure I know who you're referring to? I just searched the name in the search bar and I can't seem to find a main account. Could you drop an @? I won't post it.\n  ","861655":"\n  Oh, only every morning for me. \ud83d\ude14\n  \n  I really wish I could stop that from happening.\n  ","861656":"\n  I tend to prefer red much more than blue.\n  ","861657":"\n  I unfortunately do suffer from rly bad anxiety when it comes to going to the dentist :(\n  \n  But it mostly just comes with the fact that I have pretty bad anxiety overall. I'm prone to it.\n  ","861658":"\n  I got this three hours ago, at 10am. It was Tuesday for me \ud83d\ude14\n  ","861659":"\n  I don't have one.\n  \n  Also, I have no preferences one way or the other!\n  ","861660":"\n  I'd like to learn how to do martial arts some day! It's always been in the back of my mind to want to learn.\n  ","861661":"\n  nope! though I recognize the name, I have never seen it.\n  ","861662":"\n  I've gotta be honest, I'd feel really weird about that! It's almost as if they don't want you associated with their friends? But then, I don't get the specific thing with them wanting you to post about them. It doesn't really make sense, but it also doesn't feel quote quite right.\n  ","861663":"\n  You're on anon tho,,\n  ","861664":"\n  No worries! Have a nice day \uf895\n  ","861665":"\n  I thought this was a really sweet and thoughtful message, but the last part caught me off guard. (\u02c6 \u058a \u02c6\u0665)\n  \n  I'm not sure who the \"her\" is that you're referring to!\n  ","861666":"\n  feelings?\n  \n  a cold?\n  \n  a disease??\n  \n  I'm not sure, I'm pretty stumped on this one!\n  ","861667":"\n  Don't worry about it! I'm not upset.\n  ","861668":"\n  \ua4b0\u1421\u3063\u00b7\u032b \u2014\uff61 \u1421\ua4b1 \u22b9 * . \u272b\n  ","861669":"\n  For me, it's usually a nay. I only like olives in very specific ways, like in homestyle Puerto Rican rice or beef empanadas! But also, I have to be in the mood to have them. Sometimes the flavor of them really bothers me.\n  ","861670":"\n  That's My Melody; she's a Sanrio character!\n  ","861671":"\n  It'd be pretty nice to have a figure of one of Hatsune Miku's holiday modules as an ornament!\n  ","861672":"\n  OHHH okay gotcha. Well, I think it's an interesting idea for catering. I'm sure it'd super shock any party guest to come into the room and find a sub sandwich as long as the table before them \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n  ","861673":"\n  I love chili! Mild only, though. I don't do well with spicy foods.\n  \n  I can't wait to learn how to make home made chili some day...\n  ","861674":"\n  Nope, I had no idea that was a thing until you brought it to my attention! Where could you even get one of those? At most, I've seen people order catering from Subway with those plastic dishes full of personal size sandwiches.\n  ","861675":"\n  If I learned it from another person? Oh, absolutely. There's few things worse than someone who is two-faced and backstabbing. I'd have to let that friend know that their other friend was talking to me about them, and precisely what they said.\n  \n  If it's just something I happened upon, however.. it's not up to me to call it out. Secrets are made to be secrets for a reason. If I accidentally found out something personal that I should have, I'd rather keep hush. It feels like the most respectful thing to do, if I found something out on accident. Unless that secret puts that friend in danger, anyways.\n  ","861676":"\n  NOPE that's a new one to me. If you can still see it, I'd take a screenshot and send it to staffs' email. Explain to them what happened.\n  \n  They seem to have been having a LOT of technical issues lately.\n  ","861677":"\n  I'll send some your way! \u208a\u02da.\u0f04\n  ","861678":"\n  I think the last time I got sick was when I got the flu. I believe that was some time last year! In my adult life, I find myself rarely ever getting sick. I'm really conscious of germs, and I keep myself and my more \"germy\" environments very clean.\n  \n  Also, I have been this big of a germophobe since long before the pandemic, so it's not like I feel much different. The only new thing I'm doing that I wasn't already is wearing a mask!\n  ","861679":"\n  My phone, primarily! It used to be my brush (because I have super SUPER long hair). But I don't even carry a bag on me anymore most of the time, so it stays in the car. My phone is always on my person, though!\n  ","861680":"\n  That's actually called \"poIyamory\" \u2014 and yes, I support it! There's absolutely nothing wrong with healthy poIyamorous relationships. And when I say healthy, I mean two key important things:\n  \n  * {Everyone is in the know} \u2014 Complete transparency. Being involved with people behind the backs of everyone you're seeing is NOT poIyamory; it is cheating. It's important that everyone you're seeing knows up-front what your intentions are.\n  \n  * {Everyone agrees and consents} \u2014 Everyone involved knows that you are poIyamorous, and that you are seeing other people, AND everyone is fully okay with that.  Be communicative and honest.\n  \n  As an example, I am poIyamorous actually. And my partner is monogamous. We have talked about my want to explore other relationships, and together we have agreed on it! We have our own specific terms of Do's and Don'ts that work best for the well-being of our relationship. And it's about as easy-peasy as that!\n  \n  Everyone is different though. If you yourself are in a relationship with someone who is monogamous and doesn't want a poIyamorous partner.. it's for the better to end that relationship. Limiting yourself will only make you unhappy, which makes your partner unhappy. And going behind your partner's back despite them not wanting the relationship to be that way is just as bad, if not worse.\n  \n  Anyways. Yes, I support poIyamory. Because just like with monogamous relationships, they can be healthy OR unhealthy. It all depends on compatability and communication!\n  ","861681":"\n  If I had to only pick one foreign language to learn, it would be Japanese. I've always had an interest in learning it!\n  \n  But besides that, I do plan on traveling overseas some day. It's my life long dream to experience the richness of different cultures. And I'd hate to stumble around ignorantly on my dream journey, so it's an absolute must that I learn it.\n  ","861682":"\n  I did, yeah! And I refollowed :3\n  ","861683":"\n  HERE IT IS! Yeah sorry I missed this; I kinda forgot about the button that temporarily hides shoutouts. I didn't realize how much direct stuff has been buried by them!!\n  \n  Anyways, thank you so much for taking the time to wish me well. My Sunday went okay, but I hope yours went even better!! :3 Tell me how it went some time, if you can.\n  ","861684":"\n  Oh no, I didn't! :O Unfortunately my inbox has been getting spammed with A LOT of asks since I've started leaving anon on. The biggest culprit of it all right now is shoutouts. I'll look through my inbox to try and find it!\n  ","861685":"\n  Support her hustle, because that's her business. And also ask her for some tips, because working your body like that for a living is an active talent. I find it honestly impressive, and I wish I had it in me to have as much confidence as that!\n  \n  Seriously, we need to stop overreacting about s\u0119xwork. It's just a different kind of job that you don't understand! Nothing less, nothing more. It Is A Job. It brings money to the table. It pays bills. And these people out here doing that work are risking their personal safety day in and day out for a living. That deserves respect.\n  \n  I'm tired of the sheer amount of people that'll w\u0105nk to s\u0119xworkers with one hand, and point in anger and judgment at them with the other. It's both moronic AND ironic.\n  ","861686":"\n  \u208d\u1421\u3063 \u032b-\u1421\u208e\u141d nope! \u2741\u208a\u02da.\u0f04\n  ","861687":"\n  I do!

But me and\n  \n   @chicken_teriyaki\n  \n  take care of a stray cat that roams the neighborhood, and we've named him Salem. Even though he doesn't live with us, we buy him necessities and leisurely stuff as though he's our own. We feed him, buy toys for him, bought him a bed, buy him treats and catnip.. stuff like that!\n  \n  But yeah! It really does sound like you had a busy weekend back then (I'm srry ur ask got buried in my inbox fkjdjdjd). But I hope it wasn't a bad or stressful one. Hey at least you got some game time in!

But generally, if I see a message notification I try to be on it within ten minutes!\n  \n  As for your second question, I don't feel like it's fair to be impatient with people who aren't replying \"fast enough\" to your liking. It's selfish, and shows a lack of care (and general understanding) for the other person's situation. It's unrealistic to expect someone's continuous availability.

Ableism for both physical and mental disabilities is alive and rampant, and the lack of proper education and attention on the topic doesn't help. But here's some helpful things I think everyone should keep in mind \/ think about \/ exercise:\n  \n  .\u200e\u02d6\u066d \u2729 Disabled persons do not want you to treat them differently for their disability. They want to be treated like everyone else: with human decency and respect. (Some of my points ahead will show what I mean)\n  \n\n  .\u200e\u02d6\u066d \u2729 Maintain eye contact when you talk. People with physical disabilities will feel uncomfortable and self conscious if you gawk at the equipment that assists them. Avoid putting visual attention on their equipment unless they ask.\n  \n  .\u200e\u02d6\u066d \u2729 Do not be patronizing with your interactions. Do not do \"baby talk\" or use pet names. This kind of treatment is humiliating, even if you mean well.\n  \n  .\u200e\u02d6\u066d \u2729 Avoid showing pity \/ treating disabled people as if they are victims. Again even if you mean well, it is degrading.\n  \n  .\u200e\u02d6\u066d \u2729 Always be mindful of your language when you speak about disabilities, and persons with a lack thereof. Examples: Do not call a person a \"cripple\" or call them \"deformed\" \u2014 terms like this are offensive and make disabled people feel abnormal. Do not refer to non disabled people as \"normal\" or \"healthy\" \u2014 it implies something is \"wrong\" with disabled persons. Using \"non disabled\" or \"able-bodied\" is fine.\n  \n  .\u200e\u02d6\u066d \u2729 NEVER physically assist unless you are asked to, most especially with their assisting equipment and their bodies. Do not (without permission): push a person's wheelchair, physically lift them, or touch their equipment.\n  \n  .\u200e\u02d6\u066d \u2729 Do NOT mess with service dogs. They are on duty, meaning that distractions away from their duties assisting a person around is dangerous to their handler.\n  ","861850":"\n  Oh, is this the new way we're doing scam now? Ask.fm?

Now to answer your question.. I can do both!! But I tend to prefer iced. I think the cold of it and the bitterness go pretty well together.

I'm not going to allow myself to potentially die just because \"UUUuu boo hoo masks aren't comfortable\". You know what's really uncomfortable? The concept of getting sick with the illness that everyone is now afraid of, being quarantined from loved ones while your body fights like heII for your survival, and waiting through tremendously awful sickness to see if you'll even survive. THAT'S really uncomfortable.

But I would love recommendations for full books, as I want to do much more reading in the near future.\n  \n  * drawing - It's not something I do often anymore because of a lack of inspiration. But I used to draw all of the time, and still quite enjoy it! My primary method for creating art was pixel art, because I find it to be really charming.\n  \n  * cooking - Mostly experimentally!! I have only a few recipes down pat that I know how to make well. Like tacos, for instance.\n  \n  * creating small ascii - I like to make kaomoji (like unicode faces, such as ( \u0665\u02f6\u2a4c \u2a4a\u2a4c)\u0b68\u055e\u055e which I made recently), animals, and sometimes small bio \/ drop down layouts for Vent.\n  \n  * biking - This is one I haven't done in a while, because the last time I did someone came into the yard and stole it. I've been hesitant to take it back out since we took it back!! Plus crime rates are really high here this year, But I really have been itching to go on a bike ride.\n  \n  * nature walking - Almost nothing brings on more peace and calm than a good walk through a thicket of woods! But it's also fun to me, because I get to see new plants to take pictures of. And if I'm lucky, maybe even some wildlife.\n  \n  * taking pictures - I like to take pictures of plants and animals!

I love taking care of them!\n  \n  * singing - MOSTLY by myself. I've only sung to and around a couple of people.

The only promises that are broken, are ones that have exceptions based on unforeseeable (and most often unfortunate) occurrences.\n  \n  An example of this is, \"I promise I'll always be here for you\". This is a promise that I make to people I love and care about, with the best intentions. An unforeseeable occurrence that would waive this promise, is if that person were being crappy and I had to cut them off.\n  \n  Barring anything bad happening that would stop me from keeping a promise..

It said that I listened to it 165 times. \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\ude33\n  \n  Also I wanted to say, I only made an account with Spotify this year.

Yeah right >~< it's not for me!\n  \n  Best: Flavored solidifying shell!!! Cherry, banana, butterscotch, chocolate, peanut butter.. these come in a lot of flavors, but they're my favorite ice cream topping. When you get ice cream from a place they usually dip it in the solidifying shell, but when you do it yourself there's bottles you can buy to pour it on. Either way.. SO GOOD. SO SIMPLE.

Living forever sounds perfect, actually. I mean imagine actually having ALL of time in the world. My life would be timeless, so I would feel less pressure to do everything I want to do. I can space things out and find more time to relax! Also in terms of time, there's the fact that I'll be able to observe generation after generation to come. See the development of society, and technology, and architecture.. just SO MANY THINGS! Also, I'll be able to witness the end of the world. Which I know is grim, but..

You don't know the person besides their exterior, or their appearance. You don't know their story, personality, hardships, quips and quirks; n o t h i n g.

I'm not sure about achieving long hair growth other than patience though!! Anyways, here's what I do know in terms of having healthy hair:\n  \n  * NEVER was your hair with water that's too warm. Hot water can cause damage to the fibers of our hair, and it's the most common cause of hair breakage. Try using lukewarm \/ cool water.\n  \n  * Ensure you're using shampoo and conditioner, not 2-in-1! Picking a shampoo and conditioner set that works with our hair type is essential for increasing the health of your hair. Using shortcut products like 2-in-1 doesnt nourish and protect our strands, nor does it get it properly cleaned.\n  \n  * Don't wash your hair nightly! Make sure to have \"skip nights\" \u2014 nights where you won't wash your hair at all. I usually wash one day, then skip the next, and wash the day after. Following that pattern doesn't stress out our strands! Excessive washing can cause breakage.\n  ","862160":"\n  Drawing! I have lost a lot of my talent over the years that I've neglected to entertain it. But when I do get the chance to sit down with some motivation to be creative, I have a relatively good time.\n  ","862161":"\n  If I had to choose, I'd definitely choose to be venomous.

I think that separating oneself from any situation to be alone for a little while can be healing. Even if nothing is happening to cause you to isolate yourself, it's still generally humbling and healing. You get to know yourself, and become familiar with your feelings, and you get to understand your wants and what makes you happy better! It can be nice to be alone sometimes because it leaves us really thinking.\n  \n  Of course there's times where we need others, and we should seek that if that's the case.

Go on a hike or traverse through the woods.. just really calming, humbling activities.\n  ","862292":"\n  The concept of a Halloween themed family gathering was brought to me, and I did highly consider it. But right now my county is in emergency watch for going into level 4 (highest rank) risk for COVID. And studies have shown that small gatherings ESPECIALLY amongst other households of your family is what is causing much more spread than what was originally thought.

I can't jeopardize my life just for that.\n  ","862293":"\n  Thank you, you as well! And have a good day today too. When you sent this in yesterday, I was getting some stuff done at the dentist.

I came to the realization that I had not been giving myself enough patience and care, and I've been treating my wellbeing as something that can be put off. I've been putting my wellbeing last.\n  \n  So, I can say with confidence, that I've made massive strides in self care!

I feel what's worse is what brings you more pain directly.\n  ","862312":"\n  The.. I guess just the realization that there's so many major life choices that are being left all up to me.

I feel like I heard about him on YouTube years ago from some list channel. From what I've heard and read on him, he only ever assisted people with suicide when they were in severely poor health \/ terminally ill.

I don't have a wishlist, and I don't have any expectancies of anyone to get me anything. All I want for the holidays is to be able to spend time with those I love. And I'd love for there to be no more death around the holidays. I just want time to spend cherishing those that I care for.\n  ","862326":"\n  I love to expand my music library as much as possible! It's nice to be able to hear what other people enjoy for that reason, but also because you get to know a personal part of them!\n  ","862327":"\n  I would, yeah! Staff has already sent me something saying they're waiting for me to send out a verification video! I have to set aside the time to actually do it, but I'm planning on doing it by Monday. Wouldn't wanna email them on the weekend and have it get buried while they're not checking emails!\n  \n  I want my account verified just because! It lets people know that I'm a genuine person. On an app full of catfish and fake profiles claiming to be celebrities, it'd be nice to be wholly confirmed so that people don't assume I'm someone I'm not.\n  ","862328":"\n  Nope! This kind of piggy-backs off of my previous answer buuut the point is just the same: It would be a fat waste of my valuable time. I wouldn't ever want to stay with someone who I believe would be genuinely toxic for me. If a person can't treat other people right, then they shouldn't be getting into relationships. And they certainly don't deserve to be in one with me.\n  \n  But this should go without saying (generally speaking) : It can be hard for people in abusive relationships to see just how bad the abuse really is. Because like you said, it's wholly possible to get used to it. It's wholly possible to be convinced that THATS what you have, and that's what you'll always have. It's wholly possible to be manipulated into believing so many good things surrounding an abuser because these toxic monsters are so good at what they do: being bad.\n  \n  So please don't use my answer as a \"gotcha\" for anyone who is in an abusive relationship, or to ridicule anyone who is stuck in one. That would be absolutely unfair and downright sickening. People who are enduring toxicity from a partner or abuse need support, patience, and guidance. Not ridicule. If you know a loved one who is going through this, be supportive. Be kind. Be the light they need to be able to see in the world.\n  ","862329":"\n  No, and I really don't see how that's possible! I enter relationships and stay in relationships because of genuine interest. I find those who my heart wants to love and cherish to be always worth my time. But I wouldn't ever put in that kind of time for someone I don't really have interest in.\n  \n  Why? Well, because it's a waste of my time of course! I value my time, and wouldn't ever waste it on anyone I don't like. Not for any reason. Being in a relationship with a person I don't really like would be quite the massive inconvenience.\n  ","862330":"\n  YES OF COURSE! Onions and garlic are really tasty parts of anything they're in! They add a little bit of interesting flavor to whatever they go with. I'd never eat them raw, but.. I love them when they're prepared right! I feel that same way with most vegetables actually.\n  ","862331":"\n  Nah. I mean I probably wouldn't even get the opportunity to have to choose on this moral quandary, even. That's because I push all of my enemies far enough from me that I wouldn't be there to witness them in need. Or witness them at all to begin with, rather.\n  \n  Well, either way! I wouldn't really care to stress myself over people who are crappy. It wouldn't be worth my time or energy to, because I know the people who I hate, hate me plenty enough back to never do the same. It's best that way.\n  ","862332":"\n  Only every single day! I miss my partner (\ud83c\udf40) immensely every day since our visit ended.

There's so many tasty recipes involving pumpkin that it knocks apple and apple cider flavors out of the park.\n  ","862356":"\n  I think that if my life were in chapters, the current chapter would be titled.. \"Two Sides To Every Coin\". I want to leave it at that; vague and up to interpretation.\n  ","862357":"\n  We do this because it's hard to skew our focus towards the future, when stressful things are right in front of us. As \"little\" as those things might be, it's hard to move past them when we're in the moment.\n  ","862358":"\n  I want my legacy to be a story of living life to the fullest, loving to the fullest, and leaving my mark behind in the form of creativity and art.\n  ","862359":"\n  I have, once. When I was growing up, I changed my interests and my style to try and \"fit in\" with my sister. It was so stupid looking back on it, because it's not like it mattered anyways. She just isn't a good person, and it didn't take me too long to realize that I shouldn't change myself for anyone's sake, let alone hers.\n  ","862360":"\n  No particular thing. Rather, I miss something unattainable: the lack of responsibility. As we all age there's more we have to become responsible for. Bills, for one. The pressure to self sustain is another one. There's so much to miss about my childhood, but I mostly miss being more carefree.\n  ","862361":"\n  The very first thing I think of when I wake up is checking the time. So I'll grab my phone and check it! Depending on what I see, I either roll on out of bed or go right back to sleep.\n  ","862362":"\n  MILK. When you're done cracking your eggs into a bowl, before whisking, add a splash of milk! It makes your eggs turn out REALLY fluffy and soft.\n  ","862363":"\n  Usually, no! I mean if it's brisk enough outside I'll wear a jacket, but that's about it! Other than that, in winter I'll wear a coat and boots that layer over my pants.\n  ","862364":"\n  Now, I've been doing my best to skew my perspective on the world's populous as a whole to be more positive. I can have a bad habit of getting cynical about people, and I've made so much progress in that!\n  \n  And then.. 2020. This year happened, covid hit the states, and I've been more cynical towards people because honestly? It's true. The pandemic has brought out the worst in people, and brought the worst people out!\n  ","862365":"\n  HEYYY I never ignore questions! Rather, I make paces through my ask box and answer the ones I feel like I can get to at that time. I still have asks from three months ago that I've yet to get to.. A lot of my reasons for skipping around are that, and I want to dedicate proper time to thoroughly answer thought provoking questions. I'd hate to just shove out answers that weren't interesting, just for the sake of \"answering\" them! It'd take the fun out of it for everyone involved. If I'm to engage with the community on this app, I want to be sure I have the dedicated time to do it right on a case by case basis.\n  \n  {side note, I also seldom EVER delete asks. if you send me your username, I'll scroll through and find your asks and answer a couple.}\n  ","862366":"\n  Hi there! How's it going?\n  ","862367":"\n  UMM I don't know what zorbing even is! Never heard of the term until I read this. So my answer to the first question is definitely No.\n  \n  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022\n  \n  OKAY so I looked it up, and here's what I found: \"Zorbing (also known as globe-riding, sphereing, orbing) is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb, typically made of transparent plastic. Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope but can also be done on a level surface, permitting more rider control.\"\n  \n  SOo basically.. Riding a human sized hamster ball?? YEAH I'M IN, I'd do it in a heartbeat if I could. That sounds so fun!\n  ","862368":"\n  HONESTY. I'm not talking about the bastardized definition of it, where people seem to think being bluntly rude equates to honesty. I mean the REAL meaning of honesty: being expressive about their thoughts and feelings, being openly communicative, letting others know what's *really* going on with them, not lying just because it's \"easier\". I could go on but I think the picture is painted proper. Honesty is desirable in anyone I intend on speaking with, regardless of intention.\n  ","862369":"\n  I loathe the concept of being dirty or covered in germs, so I would have to go without internet.\n  ","862370":"\n  Actually, none that I can remember! When I cook I make sure to be really focused on the whole process. I have a tendency to be a bit of a perfectionist with it. Maybe I've had some small hiccups once or twice, but none that actually significantly affected my meal! Not to my memory anyhow.\n  ","862371":"\n  When you sent this, I believe it was raining! Right now it's just kind of chilly; brisk. Earlier this morning I could see my breath it was so cold! But now it's just a mix of sunshine and brisk air.\n  ","862372":"\n  There actually was one other that started up, but I am pretty sure the website ceased to exist not too long after it was put up.. It was called bloffy! And you could theme your profile in similar ways to how you could on Old \"GOOD\" MySpace. I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure it's gone, at least I thought it was the last I checked.. Bummer.\n  \n  But yeah! I have to agree with your side note! Carrd is really confusing to work with. It took me ages to figure out how to set up mine and even then, I only set up a \"basic\" looking site on there. It's something that I'd imagine takes a lot of time to really work with and get accustomed to!\n  ","862373":"\n  There's actually a lot that I like to do when it rains, but I primarily have two halves of me that favor certain activities over others. Half of me wants to favor drinking tea and reading in pure, blissful silence (other than the rain pitter-pattering against the house) \u2014 then half of me wants to run around outside and just feel it wash over me. No one's usually going around outside when it rains so the hyper active part of me craves spinning around in my backyard, judgment free, just enjoying having fun in peace.\n  ","862374":"\n  I love to photograph moments in nature. Especially animals and critters if and when possible! I love taking pictures and videos of my local neighborhood squirrels.\n  ","862375":"\n  Chicken paprikash!\n  ","862376":"\n  I like them, yeah! As with anything, the berry related flavors are my favorite. I want to expand and try more than I've had though.. maybe from more \"authentic\" locations. Maybe then I could see a little better into why people seem so crazy about boba drinks!\n  ","862377":"\n  I hope you sleep well!! Getting good rest is MAD important \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc49\n  ","862378":"\n  Being able to see someone special again.

It's always worthwhile to be patient for loved ones who don't live close to us!\n  ","862379":"\n  IMMEDIATELY, I'd like to be able to make a 3D wooden animal sculpture. Preferably, a squirrel! But I might not be able to get over the fact that I can't accurately depict their fluffy tails.

No thanks.\n  ","862384":"\n  Strawberry Pound Cake, from Bath & Body Works! They have all of my favorite scents, from soaps to sprays! I have a pretty large collection of their products actually. Their products smell so good you could almost eat them.. (\u0e51 ; \ufe43 ; \u0e51)\n  ","862385":"\n  Earlier when you sent this, I was having a tough time. I was trying to keep two dogs who seemed to have gotten out of their yard from getting hit by passing cars. They were just wandering around outside my house, and I had to crouch on the side of the road and keep them company.\n  \n   @chicken_teriyaki\n  \n  posted a picture of them on this neighborhood report app he has, and we called animal control to report their whereabouts. They went down the alley across the way and didn't come back out! Anyways that was all very stressful.\n  \n  Right now as I'm answering this, I'm.. hmm I guess I'm okay! A little bit tired but otherwise fine. Thank you for asking, I really appreciate it! How are you holding up?\n  ","862386":"\n  HEYYY good taste, good taste! Tiramisu is a very savory dessert. It's been my favorite ever since I first tried it. Do you have any place you prefer to get it at?\n  ","862387":"\n  Then let's!! \u0669(\u0e51\u275b\u30ef\u275b\u0e51)\u0648\u273f\u22c6. I definitely wouldn't mind if you spammed my inbox with stuff. Hit me up any time!

There's a lot of desserts (and regular food dishes too) that you can just visibly tell are made with the utmost effort and love, and I'm all about that! The creation of food is an art in of itself that I really like to appreciate. And that I can only hope to achieve some day. Plus, some pictures of desserts are just.. visually satisfying. Like if something looks really soft, or has a beautiful array of colors, it's just really appealing!\n  ","862390":"\n  Thank you so much, that means a lot! How's life been treating you? I hope you've been well, but if not lmk! I'm around to listen \ud83c\udf38\n  ","862391":"\n  Initially I thought, \"Yeah why not, that doesn't sound too bad\". I do like candy corn, and I *do* like chocolate. It sounded like an interesting combination!\n  \n  Then I thought about how tooth-achingly SWEET candy corn is already. Adding chocolate to it would make every piece a missile aimed right at the nerves of my teeth. OOF.. might have to pass.\n  \n  Chocolate covered apples don't sound the worst, though! But I'd most likely just prefer caramel apples.\n  ","862392":"\n  OH! Thank you sm! (* ,,^ \u30ee ^,,)\u2730*\uff61\n  ","862393":"\n  Here's my current top three favorites!

I just looked up a specific type, and it looks like Rosa 'Mister Lincoln' is what I have in mind. Here's a snippet of a description about it from its Wiki:\n  \n  \"Rosa 'Mister Lincoln', also known as 'Mr. Lincoln', is a dark red Hybrid tea rose cultivar.\"\n  \n  The color is very eye catching!\n  ","862395":"\n  I'd just avoid them. I'm a relatively non confrontational person, so long as I can help it. Besides! If someone doesn't like me, that's 110% not my problem; it's their problem. I live to please no one else but myself! Senseless negativity and spite is never worth the time, effort, or attention.\n  ","862396":"\n  I don't watch too many movies to begin with actually, so I don't have a favorite franchise for horror! But I'm always open to suggestions if you have any. I'm pretty open minded to try just about anything!\n  ","862397":"\n  Oh goodness I ABSOLUTELY LOVE pumpkin pie! It's a really cozy dessert. I've unfortunately never had the privilege of making it myself, but I've always wanted to learn how. Desserts that involve pumpkin are pretty much the best part of autumn! Pumpkin pie, pumpkin roll, pumpkin spiced drinks.. I'm hungry now.\n  \n  Anyways, I've only ever had pumpkin pie pre-made and frozen to be baked. And the warming smell it fills the house with is phenomenal. The only thing I'd imagine could beat that, is smelling a pumpkin pie you created Yourself! Some day, some day..\n  ","862398":"\n  September was a month that was full of pain for me, but it was also a month full of learning and self development. So I have to say, over the last month I've lost some but definitely won some too! It's not been all that bad. I'm striving to have October be a much better month. So far, so good!\n  ","862399":"\n  I truthfully believe that the going gets easier over time! Whether or not it's part of us \"getting used to it\" is totally situational, but I for the most part hold the belief that things just get better. There is so much good in the world to experience to keep stuck in the mindset that things won't ever change!\n  \n  I used to struggle a lot with shifting this mentality around, but it was over the passage of time that I was able to. I don't think it was from getting used to my problems, though. I think that more or less, I got into the \"it gets better\" mindset by surviving through all of my struggles. Getting through those troubles made me stronger, more aware, and more level headed so that I might cope. And now that I'm better at coping, I have the ability to strive for better. It just takes time.\n  ","862400":"\n  Nope! I've always had android OS phones. I personally find Apple's product pricing to leave much to be desired. Way too expensive for what you get, in my honest opinion.\n  ","862401":"\n  Actually I remember learning some time ago in high school that it was originally made to show status. If I recall correctly, it was worn as a symbol of importance and higher wealth.\n  ","862402":"\n  Definitely immortality. At first I wanted to say \"endless supply of cash\", but that means not a thing in comparison to Living Forever. Being able to experience so many great things for all eternity: sunrise, sunset, the change of seasons, love, technological development, scientific development.. I'll take all of that over infinite money any day! Plus, with infinite time to experience the world, I would feel much less pressure. I'd be able to exist comfortably, with much less stress. That has more value to me than masses of wealth.\n  ","862403":"\n  I let it dry on its own. Which I know is technically not the best thing for your hair.. but my hair goes down almost to the backs of my knees. I'd be spending at least an hour on blowdrying my hair if I wanted to go that route.\n  ","862404":"\n  I don't fully believe in either, no. A big part of me wants to, but I guess I've just never had any sort of reading to be able to experience any truth behind them.\n  ","862405":"\n  Today, you don't have to go to work. That's right, A MONDAY OFF! Take advantage of this gracious opportunity, and use this free time to take care of yourself. You deserve it. Last week you worked really hard, so let's start this week off at a snails pace. Be more focused on yourself.\n  ","862406":"\n  Not very often at all! I'd like to be more bold with the changes I make and when, but change is tough for me. I mean, my natural color is the color I have currently. I last dyed my hair innn.. like.. 7th grade? Maybe? The last major alteration I made to my hairstyle is when \ud83c\udf40 bleached my bang tips!\n  ","862407":"\n  1. Favorite movie: Coraline\n  \n  2. Favorite show: Beastars\n  \n  3.

Here's one that I just downloaded today.\n  ","862409":"\n  My favorite thing to do in the fall is hike around wooded areas and observe the way nature is taking to the change of the seasons! I like to see the changing of the trees, and watch animals prepare for the colder months to come. At least, that's what comes to mind for outdoor activity.\n  \n  Much more boOoring, indoors... I like to brew seasonal hot teas, read, snuggle up in blankets, play games, ehh etc etc. You get the picture. The cold makes me want to burrow in where it's warm most of the time! But the beginning of fall is absolutely crucial for outdoor activity. The sight of the leaves changing is the best part of it!\n  ","862410":"\n  Hmm.. I don't have any particular favorite language! Not for speaking or hearing. Though in favor for *learning* I think I'd like to learn how to speak French, or Japanese!\n  ","862411":"\n  oh god kokichi turn around monokuma going to kill you oh no he has airpods in oh god oh fuck\n  ","862412":"\n  An important part of coping in hard times is first understanding this: pain and suffering do not correlate to who we are as people. A lot of people find themselves in such deep hurt that they spiral down a path of taking it out on themselves. Holding the belief that one simply \"must have earned it\" to be going through hard times is an example of this.\n  \n  I promise, no matter how much agony you're shouldering, it's not a punishment. It's not happening because you did something wrong. In truth, bad things happen to everyone, good or bad. It's important to understand that it's all a part of life. Life is full of ups and downs, and unfortunately we all sometimes go through those downs! Some of us go through it harder than others, but all the same it's not a direct stab at us from the universe when it happens.\n  \n  Unfortunately there's no real \"how\" or \"why\" answer to satisfy this question. What matters is that we don't take it out on ourselves or others, and that we do our best to keep moving forward. I hope you find healing soon.\n  ","862413":"\n  I feel like a lot of people have a bad habit of doing that to try and dissolve tension. I've let a few people I talk to know before, \"That's a little weird\". They usually say something along the lines of how they don't know how to appropriately approach things, and they don't know what to say. But they have to know and understand that it's not a healthy way of communicating, and learn how to drop it. Habits like that don't allow you to develop your social skills.\n  ","862414":"\n  Honestly? A hot mug of mint herbal tea! It's something that always makes me feel extremely relaxed.\n  ","862415":"\n  I've had bad internet provider experience no matter who I get service from! It's primarily because no contract plans are cared the less about. We get dished out the poorer end of any kind of service, because we aren't signing our money away by contract. I've had it the worst with AT&T and Verizon thus far.\n  ","862416":"\n  I've never gone to any parties that I've actually wanted to go to, like with friends or whatever. I've only really ever gone to ones with family, and those I leave as soon as I can. I get people'd out pretty fast unfort. Working on getting better at that though! But 2020 has certainly hampered that progress..\n  ","862417":"\n  I've got to be honest and tell them about it. Genuinely, most of the time if a friend or someone you know is being annoying they usually aren't aware of it. So I use an honest, but kind approach for *friends* particularly. \"Hey, you're doing (X) and it's a little upsetting. Can you tone it down a little?\" \u2014 something like that! Have never had a problem with that.\n  \n  If, however, it's a total stranger being irritating.. they are usually doing it on purpose. I'm not afraid of being a little more blunt. Not harsh, not brutal: just *blunt*. Forward. These people are usually in surprise that someone as soft in appearance as me can be that way so that usually ends it. If by chance they continue, I hope they enjoy being ignored. They're not worth the time or energy of even being recognized beyond that point.\n  ","862418":"\n  My favorite season is spring! It's when plant life begins anew, there's plenty of relaxing bedtime rain, and the temperatures are a gentle and tolerable warmth. Also more critters start coming out in the spring (like squirrels and such) so that's always a plus! I'm also a spring baby, so maaaybe I'm born with a little bit of bias..? Hm, well! Either way. SPRING!\u02d6\u273f\n  ","862419":"\n  You're absolutely right! Only hoping things look up from here.\n  ","862420":"\n  Talking in front of groups of people is definitely not my strongsuit. Performing, doing speeches, or presenting had always been something I would struggle with all throughout my academic life. I tend to get super anxious with a ton of people watching me.\n  ","862421":"\n  Instantaneously, Joel from Vinesauce\n  ","862422":"\n  I've never seen a ghost, no! But I have had a small handful of physical paranormal experiences.\n  \n  At most, I've seen weird stuff out of the corners of my eyes when there's poor lighting. Or when I'm sleep deprived. But I've never actually laid my eyes on a spiritual entity!\n  ","862423":"\n  I get right into my routine! Brushing teeth, using the restroom, going down to wash \/ exfoliate my face.. then I come back up and moisturize before actually starting my day.\u22c6\u273f\n  ","862424":"\n  I'm not sure who specifically you're referring to! I assume \ud83c\udf40, since I talked about going to visit him in August..? So I'll just answer off of that assumption!\n  \n  I would go and re visit him, and re experience every single day I spent with him over and over again if I could. I play over the memories we shared in my head all of the time.. Needless to say, I hold no regrets whatsoever towards spending that time off of work to meet him in person. I love and cherish him, and would love to do it all over again.\n  ","862425":"\n  Ohh, nice! Is there anything there that you'd be looking forward to? Like, is there family there? Or is it just a place that fascinates you?\n  ","862426":"\n  Generally uncomfortable, I'd think. For eating, all around if  were to watch me I'd have a hard time not saying something about it. I can get really self conscious about the way I look when I'm eating. I'd worry that I'm.. I don't know! Looking gross? Making a mess?\n  \n  If one of my  specifically were watching me sleep, I'd think it was cute. And it might make me feel pretty good about myself, because I don't ever usually find myself to be all that appealing after sleep. But if I woke up to see one of their smiling faces, I'd feel pretty happy. Sheepish and shy, but happy.\n  ","862427":"\n  Feel free to spam me with questions any time!\n  ","862428":"\n  I'd go for tangerines! At least based off of what I've read.. I have never had an actual tangerine. But after what I just learned, they sound overall more palatable than oranges.\n  \n  They're sweeter than oranges, have less acidic contents, shorter aftertaste, and are \"more flavorful\" according to this one blog post. That sounds right up my alley!\n  ","862429":"\n  I'm not familiar with the name unfortunately. What genre does he create in?\n  ","862430":"\n  Actually, yeah! I noticed that I have a weird preference towards my left side. I don't necessarily think the other side is \"bad\", per se. But I definitely have a preference of turning to show my left side.\n  ","862431":"\n  The texture of most baked fruits really bothers me! Most especially apple. The taste of apple pie is incredible, but I can never get past the texture of the apple slices to actually enjoy it.\n  ","862432":"\n  People around my neighborhood really don't care about the pandemic. There's still parties up the street every single weekend. I live in a relatively bad area though, so it comes to me as no surprise that no one knows how to act amongst all of.. this.\n  ","862433":"\n  I don't have an \"official\" garden or anything like that unfortunately! But just recently I did go out back and plant some surprise lily bulbs with\n  \n   @chicken_teriyaki\n  \n  ! They won't grow until next year, so it's pretty much just a waiting game.\n  \n  If I had it my way, if it were physically possible, I would have a massive garden full of all sorts of things. One area for flowers, and another for fruits and veggies!\n  \n  {image attached is not mine; it's to show what type of lily we planted}\n  ","862434":"\n  Not that I can ever recall! Maybe during winter if I wanted to play outside, I'd have to wear a couple of layers of socks or a hoodie under my coat. But nothing unreasonable, I don't think.\n  ","862435":"\n  Plastic surgery is not for me. I don't (personally) like the concept of getting my natural appearance altered artificially. The thought of someone sculpting me with tools and flesh and fat makes me.. a little ill. I already sometimes don't recognize myself when I do simple new things with my hair, or wear different clothes. That can sometimes make me dissociative alone. So I couldn't imagine what going through plastic surgery would do to me mentally.\n  \n  HOWEVER, however. I do support anyone who feels that they want to explore getting surgically done up! It's your body, and your life, and ultimately your decision. People should be allowed to do with their bodies as they want, so long as it's nothing seriously harmful to them.\n  ","862436":"\n  I would say so, yes! I'm in a really good mood today. It's Friday, it's beautiful outside, I feel well rested.. nothing to not be happy about!\u273f\uf895\n  ","862437":"\n  I don't have kids, and I am adamant on staying that way. And hell, I've been adamant on that even since I WAS a kid myself! The concept of having kids, whether through conceiving or through adoption is not at all appealing to me. Having kids doesn't line up with any of my ideals in life. And I'd never bring a child into my world, which is a world I've not built around the concept of them and their future.\n  ","862438":"\n  \u2601\ufe0f\ud83d\udca9\u2b50\n  ","862439":"\n  Hmm.. nah, I'm good.

There's near endless videos and pictures online of all the neat things that are overseas. From something as simple as completely new flavors of typical candy we have in the US, to vending machines for cakes and pizzas! Well I guess I'm only focusing on the food aspect.. there's a great many stores, cafes, hotels, and more that I'd love to see as well.\n  ","862441":"\n  I am dating! And not currently searching.\n  ","862442":"\n  It's hard to 100% believe in forces that directly alter our realities; I continously have a back and forth about this within myself. I feel.. maybe that I don't believe in destiny and karma in their root definitions.\n  \n  Like, karma is supposed to be something good or bad happening as a *direct result* of a prior action, right? And I mean not something as simple as someone committing crimes and getting the \"karma\" of being arrested. I mean that's more predictable. I'm talking more or less two completely unrelated scenarios happening.\n  \n  For example, someone breaks a heart. They get their heart broken in the future. Can we really believe that that's the universe's punishment? It sounds all too.. coincidental. I think the concept of karma, or people \"getting what they've earned\" is a comforting one.

It's easiest for me to learn how to do something if I watch it done first!\n  ","862445":"\n  Women's shoes (especially fancy \/ \"dress\" shoes) are often created with the most impractical design. They're not made to accommodate the wearer for much activity other that swift, smooth, elegant footsteps. Most particularly, the type of shoes Cinderella was wearing.\n  \n  They're referred to as \"slippers\" because that's what they do: slip. They aren't made with an ankle or over-the-foot strap, solely for the convenience of being able to \"slip\" the shoes on and off. That being said, it'd be easy to lose one in fast paced activity, such as when she was running. Sucker just *pop*! Slipped right off. There's nothing to keep it in place!\n  ","862446":"\n  I am, absolutely! \ud83c\udf41\ud83c\udf83 I feel like I've been waiting the whole year for these muggy hot temps to roll on out of here!! But finally, fall is here to stay and I'm actually pretty excited to embrace these cooler temperatures. Gives me more comfortable means to snuggle up in blankets!!\n  \n  Plus, it's pretty calming to be able to go outside every day and see the leaves change yet another shade as they fall. Fall is a month where a lot of nature dies and I'm not always hype about it.

Yes I do, and I have loved it ever since I watched it when I was a kid. Being an adult on the internet, I have seen almost nothing but hate for it. And I never was able to understand that!\n  \n  It was a really funny movie with plenty of catchy songs, memorable quotes, and good messages. What's terrible about any of that? I loved that movie and loved it still when I rewatched it a few months ago!\n  ","862454":"\n  One of the simplest things that make me happy is spending some time in my own backyard.

The concept that we absolutely *have to* forgive and forget \"in order to heal\" is incredibly toxic. No one should have to put themselves at risk for being hurt again just to be \"the better person\". The most healing thing one can do is forget our enemies to begin with. They are unimportant. It's better for an individuals personal health to move forward instead of looking back; to strive for better.\n  ","862456":"\n  It kind of does, doesn't it? It seriously looks straight out of a cartoon! Also I wish this was my house \ud83d\ude33 \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48 unfortunately this is just a picture of a house I stumbled upon.

Corona cases are increasing in my state, and these freaking dumb dumbs I work around aren't wearing masks. So basically I have to avoid working in the section they occupy until they all leave, for my health and safety. It's hard to plan around them when I don't know their schedules.\n  ","862458":"\n  I keep getting stuck on what is most desirable to me in a house.

I have a really hard time with pepperoni, unfortunately.. I have traveled a long journey with it. I hated it, then I tolerated it for years.. then I went straight back into hating it.

Meanwhile, if it's on a Supreme, it's usually super small pieces that are easy to remove before baking.

Inanimate objects are physically incapable of being in control of us. The only thing that manipulates what we do and how long we do something is attachment and addiction. The device itself isn't controlling us. It isn't forcing us to use it. It isn't holding us hostage. When someone gets really into using their tech, it's either because they're attached to their networks or they thrive from whatever they get out of it. When something gives you a grand amount of satisfaction, often like nothing else could, it's hard to put down. That's where the loss of control comes in: solely within the individual.\n  \n  SO basically, this notion that our devices control us absolves responsibility of the individual. It instead puts blame on the device for how much we use it. It's important to move the focal point to Ourselves. And if necessary, make adjustments on just how reliant we are on these devices.\n  ","862464":"\n  After since April ended, time (from my perspective) has been flying by SCARY FAST.

I don't really get too picky about this because it's such a minute detail on someone. When it comes to the person's I love, all that matters in their eyes is that I'm able to see how much love there is behind them. I love being able to see how a person feels through looking into their eyes, no matter what the color.\n  \n  Though if you're asking what eye color the recipient has, well.. I have blue eyes!\n  ","862472":"\n  I think it really all depends! There is some people who put more work into their vehicle than others. There's most people, who stick with their stock setup and appearance on their vehicles. Primarily because it's often seen as a financial luxury to go all out on revamping your car. Those people you can't really tell much about! Not financial status, not much of anything!\n  \n  However, if I see a chrome painted car with tinted windows and colored LED lights I'm gonna think \"wow, they must have a lot of money, they must be really well off, they must be passionate about their appearance and the vibes they give off\". But I don't think I can read a person much further than that, just based off of their vehicle alone.\n  ","862473":"\n  Right now it's 8pm on the dot- NOPE. Scratch that, 8:01pm.

I'm gonna be honest, I'm a little lost feeling. Long story short, my supervisor (who is thrice my age i-hi-hiiIF that matters) is starting rumors about me to other coworkers.

Pizza bagels are so good but RRRRRRR it's always feels like they get really rough around the edges super easy. But pizza rolls are always bangin', even if you did accidentally overcook them. You can just scoop up the spilled out pizza guts with the shell and all's still good. Nothing is lost.\n  ","862477":"\n  I don't actively observe either sports, but I do appreciate the the precision and techniques used in boxing!

I couldn't even tell you what it said because I genuinely don't remember. That was so long ago..\n  ","862481":"\n  From a moralistic standpoint, I don't really agree with it. I feel like it absolves the home owner of personal responsibility from their own messes. As someone who has worked in cleaning, I have seen this firsthand.\n  \n  Essentially, once a person knows they have someone to come in and magically poof away the mess, they feel careless and free to be piggish. Messes are a problem of the past to these people. They act more careless with their very own spaces because they know they no longer have to. They're paying someone else to care, after all. Basically that's the kind of attitude these people who pay for personal cleaning services seem to carry.\n  \n  I just feel like it's important for a person to be responsible for what they've done. Like, why make a mess for someone else to fix? So long as you're physically able, I think you (not personal, I mean general \"you\") should clean your own messes. It keeps you active, and in healthy mindsets. It keeps you from becoming a slob that is reliant on helping hands to do work for you.\n  ","862482":"\n  I am too!

If you keep on sprinkling in lies everywhere instead of the truth, you (general) may even begin to have a hard time telling what's real and what's fabricated.

You'll have a lot of mess to clean up later if you fabricate every other thing..\n  ","862525":"\n  In my opinion (or I should say my experiences), it's easier to recover from hurtful words than it is from being physically hurt.

To be honest I make myself hungry too. I'm actually about to be eating soon thankfully. I hope you've had something to eat today!!\n  ","862535":"\n  I'm glad you do! There's something oddly satisfying to me about images that are perfectly cut out from their background. Maybe it's that? I know that's primarily my reason for posting so many. (\u201e\u275b \u058a \u275b\u201e) I hoard a lot of pngs (transparent images) to form polls into some time. It's kind of fun to see who all likes what!\n  ","862536":"\n  OHH I think I know what you're talking about. \u2014 I just looked it up, yep! The black bags of popcorn, kind of potato chip bag sized. I've only ever had white cheddar and I love it. I didn't even know there was other flavors!\n  ","862537":"\n  Nope! It's never really been a concern for me. I know some people are allergic to certain kinds of materials, or have generally sensitive skin to some types.

We've not done much to decorate the house for holidays since then..!\n  \n  But I do want to set up some Halloween themed lights in my bedroom at the very least.\n  ","862541":"\n  No, I really don't think so. I find peace and calm in the truth. The only reason people who don't know the truth about something are blissful, is because they have yet to find the truth. Once they do, their whole world can collapse.\n  ","862542":"\n  Nope, it's not something that's for me! I don't like the idea of making something bite a hook and get it painfully stabbed into its mouth just to pull it out where it can't breathe and oggle it. And I know that there's fish friendly bobbers but still. EHHH it's not for me.\n  ","862543":"\n  Criminals are made. There's a lot of psychologically challenging events a lot of criminals go through before they start committing crimes. I don't say that in any way to pity criminals or justify their actions, by the way. It's just the most typical case scenario.\n  ","862544":"\n  \"Talk shit about me; I'm gonna find where you live and I'll clip through your house.

Turn them off, and you will no longer receive notifications for those.\n  ","862551":"\n  I'm not sending you polls. I never send anyone any kind of thing I post on here. I post them and move on.\n  \n  If you are, however, referring to you getting *notifications* that I have posted polls, there's a switch in the notification settings to turn those off.\n  ","862552":"\n  DEFINITELY a poisonous snake. You know, wolves are actually freaking GIGANTIC.. idk what happened or how I thought this, but for most of my life I thought they were much smaller than they actually are. They're very large animals, and plus? They move in packs. I'd be dead for sure if I ran into a wolf.\n  \n  But with a snake, with its size, I feel like it'd be much easier to survive an encounter. Running isn't recommended if you're super close, but if necessary one would be easy to sling away or kill. At least much easier than it would be to defend yourself against wolves.\n  ","862553":"\n  Death of loved ones, including the animals I care for. I don't need any more loss this year; hell NOOO, no thank you. Though I suppose that's more of a perpetual anxious worry than a fear.. hm.\n  \n  Something that I'm really afraid of is sleep paralysis. I've only ever had it a couple of times, very briefly. And they can be some of the most terrifying things to experience in a tired state.\n  ","862554":"\n  I have and will continue to always promise my friends a place to be listened to, understood, and loved. Even if I don't get back to them right away, my inbox is a few taps away. I always want my friends to feel like they have someone they can come to. That's incredibly important to me.\n  ","862555":"\n  I will always trust my friends more than my parents. It's the way it has always been, because my friends have always been much more reliable and caring.\n  ","862556":"\n  You should never share anyone's...\n  \n  \u22c6 phone number\n  \n  \u22c6 address\n  \n  \u22c6 full legal name\n  \n  \u22c6 secrets\n  \n  \u22c6 trauma\n  \n  \u22c6 personal feelings \/ events\n  \n  \u22c6 embarrassing facts\n  \n  Aaaaand I mean basically anything they wouldn't put out there themselves. It's important to know boundaries and not overstep. If someone confides in you for personal things, don't take advantage of that. Trust cannot be easily earned back as easily as it can be taken away.\n  ","862557":"\n  Full offense? Too bad, I don't care. This is my profile. I get to do with it what *I* want. What you want sincerely has the same level of significance as a grain of sand to me.\n  \n  And considering the next question you sent in, you don't even deserve the chance to participate.\n  \n  I'm not going to free an hour of my valuable time just because some homunculus on anon wants free jack off material.\n  \n  Bottom line, my profile, my life, my time, my rules. You saying you \"wanna\" means not a single thing to me. Goodbye.\n  ","862558":"\n  I've seen a few other users take on similar concepts, and I've definitely considered it. One I remember seeing on a few profiles is \"honesty week\", which actually might work better for me instead. If I'm going to host something for the userbase to engage with, I want to be sure the amount of time is fair! An hour is much too short for both myself and anyone who wants to participate. I want to be sure I'll have the time to get back to every question participating in that, just so no one feels \"left out\" if that makes sense.\n  \n  Basically, I'm considering setting up \"honesty week\" instead of \"honesty hour\" to really maximize engagement with the community!\n  \n  When I do figure out how I want to set it up, I'll make an announcement post on the weekend prior. And if anyone misses that post, I'll have my display name set up to remind anyone who comes to my profile what's going on. So do keep a look out!\n  \n  \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 I'll absolutely work on this soon now that I see there's some interest in me doing it too. I might even start it this upcoming Monday! Anyways, thanks for letting me know.\n  ","862559":"\n  Posting this because it's very solid advice. Don't keep things \/ hobbies \/ people around that will limit you from your full potential and full happiness.\n  ","862560":"\n  Yes, and no. Or, rather.. yes and THEN for most people there's a stopping point in that maturing. Allow me to explain.\n  \n  The more we age, the more we are able to experience! Relationships, exploration, individuality, independence, you name it. We gain a lot of knew knowledge with new experiences. And most life changing experiences happen as we age through adulthood. But for a lot of people there's a stunt in their mental growth and maturity when they reach a certain point. It can be a lack of willingness to do new things, or a level of comfort with where a person is at. Or, a complete disinterest in working on things that make us better.\n  \n  UGH I could have put this more simply I think, and when I re-read your question I keep thinking I'm going about this the wrong way. My bad! I think what I'm trying to say is: yes, you do mature a lot more as you age. But there's a lot of people who aren't willing to be mature about certain things about themselves in order to *keep* maturing.\n  ","862561":"\n  I've only recently heard of Blackish, but I don't know anything about it. And I never really sat and watched America's Got Talent, but I've seen snippets. But since I've not ever avidly watched either, I don't think I can answer with much more than this.\n  ","862562":"\n  We find comfort in self assurance. The concept of being utterly wrong can make some people spiral, because they most cling to what they believe in. And for those people, in the end, who are they without their beliefs?\n  \n  I think that many people are just afraid of being wrong. Whether that's from trauma or just wanting to feel confident in the \"knowledge\" they've found (or something else entirely) is totally dependant on the person.\n  ","862563":"\n  I don't care for sports one way or the other. Never really interested me!\n  ","862564":"\n  This is gonna be a sucky answer, so sorry in advance! But my high school couldn't really afford to provide its student body with any real extracurricular activities.\n  ","862565":"\n  Not to be cheesy or anything. But all I want for Christmas is to be able to spend more relaxed quality time with those I love. This year has been full of so much death and loss (emotional loss, physical loss, financial loss, just.. loss of all kinds). I just want to be able to spend the holidays cherishing who I still have. And hopefully being cherished back. I want to spend time with my partners, my friends, my pets, my neighborhood squirrels.. basically all of the life left that I cherish in this world is what I want this Christmas.\n  ","862566":"\n  In my area, there's still a lot of precautions being enforced, and thousands upon thousands of people here have still been out of a job. Along with that, many still haven't been able to receive compensation from the state. Plenty of people going poor. I haven't kept up on how many cases there's been here for a while so I'm not sure actually of the current state of the virus here.. but we are still in an extremely precautionary state. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely see why. It's just dreadful that so many people are being sank into poverty..\n  ","862567":"\n  OKAY. Oh my God. Let me tell you, I'm actually ecstatic that you sent me this. I'm going to be honest, I thought that I had fever dreamed that movie existing. I watched it when I was probaby.. 6? 7? 8? And I completely forgot the title of it, so I genuinely thought the movie was a part of my overactive child imagination. But when I read the title in your ask, IT HIT ME! THAT MOVIE UUUUGH.\n  \n  My favorite ghost was the woman who was covered in lacerations, carrying a knife, surrounded in whispers (if I remember correctly). I don't remember if she had a name so  lemme look into this for a second. (doo dee doo doing some research) THE ANGRY PRINCESS!! Ah, yes. One of my first bisexual awakenings; I had something of a crush on her. I also just really felt for her backstory and felt bad for her. I might not have wholly understood or resonated with her, considering I was a literal child who PROBABLY shouldn't have been allowed to watch this movie. But anyways. Yeah. Wow that unlocked a lot of memories.\n  ","862568":"\n  Hmm.. I usually don't crave anything particularly weird! I have pretty standard tastes in food. Or so I think..?\n  \n  Well, actually when I think about it, one thing people say is weird is how I like my favorite Subway sandwich. I usually get a chicken bacon ranch, on toasted wheat bread (just a little crispy). Inside, I get ranch, mustard, red onion, and pickles. I haven't eaten Subway in.. oh shit I don't think I've eaten there at ALL this year! But I just remembered the almost disgusted looks the person making my sandwich would give. One person even asked me and\n  \n   @chicken_teriyaki\n  \n  (he'd get virtually the same thing, but with different veggies) \"is it even good that way\".\n  ","862569":"\n  I remember being asked this one a while ago, and my answer was \"I don't ever watch musicals\". BUT.. since then, I have officially watched exactly ONE musical, and it's the only musical I need to watch. Cats (the original stage musical, not the 2019 film) is that musical. I loved the songs, I loved the choreography, I loved the costume designs (especially the design for Rum Tum Tugger). I watched it when I was in Maine in August visiting my partner (\ud83c\udf40)! I fell in love with it. I don't exactly seek out musicals, because they're not my thing. But I don't at all regret watching Cats.\n  ","862570":"\n  I followed you back! Thanks for sending a bunch of questions by the way. Hope you have a good day!! \u2741\n  ","862571":"\n  I don't know who that is,,\n  ","862572":"\n  YES!! I was just talking to\n  \n   @chicken_teriyaki\n  \n  about this earlier. I keep on making more and more haphazard typing errors. I think it has to do with the fact that my nails are shorter right now, and my typing methods I'm usually used to aren't exactly working with my keyboard.. I might need to change the spacing in my keyboard until my thumb nails at least grow back in a lil more.\n  ","862573":"\n  HAHAHA none \ud83d\ude10 I don't really like them. But I'm rather responsive to being offered a square of tiramisu, if that counts.\n  ","862574":"\n  I'm most likely not going to wear it out, but I have several costumes to choose from! I could be a cat, I could be an angel, I could be a lil devil.. There's plenty to choose from. And I haven't even gotten to wear any of these yet past trying them on.\n  ","862575":"\n  I don't feel like there's any kind of secret to having healthy and happy partnerships! I just feel like there's things that are common knowledge that too many of us neglect. And whether or not that's a lack of care or a lack of interest is dependant on the person neglecting their love and love life.\n  \n  I think that what you need for a happy and healthy partnership (or partnerships) is finding a person you really connect with. An honest connection truly helps all that other good stuff that a relationship needs to flourish, come naturally! These needs are: love, compassion, care, kindness, understanding, and trust! These things can't be forced. If there's no honest connection first, there's no sense in the rest.\n  ","862576":"\n  My dreams are often so sporadic and \"out there\" that it's really hard to break down into a list exactly what's joggin' up in the ole noggin' while I sleep. But I can try and find some general themes that are common in my dreams:\n  \n  * animals (my dogs and the neighborhood squirrels)\n  \n  * relationships\n  \n  * things I'm anxious about during consciousness\n  \n  * general fears\n  \n  * general hopes and aspirations\n  \n  * games and shows I like\n  \n  At the moment I'm struggling to think of anything else that commonly is a theme of my dreams. But I feel like it's really normal for a lot of people to have dreams like those.\n  ","862577":"\n  I have three siblings, and I'm the youngest. I want to talk about my eldest sibling because honestly? She's pretty cool. We aren't terribly close, but she had helped me through a lot when I was discovering myself and exploring my identity. She was the only person in my family who sat and talked to me and tried to relate to me. Also, she's really helpful and caring. When the pandemic reached our state, she sewed everyone in our family custom face masks!\n  ","862578":"\n  I've gotta pass on this one. There's nothing wrong with your question, I just don't like to dig things up that were already resolved! I try not to dwell too much on things I've already healed from.

We both found some really cool brand new (original tags included) clothes at insanely discounted prices.\n  \n  Sunday, we went to Home Depot and got some trowels to plant our surprise lily bulbs with! We're going to plant them soon, and they'll lay dormant in the earth until next year.\n  \n  That's all I can really remember that stands out the most. It was a packed weekend with lots of time spent out and about. But you know?

And as long as a person keeps on exploring new things, and new possibilities, I truly believe there's no stop in growth.

It was my very first anime. I caught sight of it on Toonami via Adult Swim around 5am (and I remember that was its time slot back then) when tiny child me woke up in the middle of the night.

From what I looked through in my results, their personality analysis is relatively accurate. I have always heard of this \"personality type\" stuff but never gave too much of a look into it.

Staff changed the coin earning game to make it much more of a challenge. You used to be able to earn +5 per every direct question of yours that someone asked you. Now the only ways to earn coins is by people gifting you them, you watching ads, or you buy them (with real money, which I'd NEVER recommend).
