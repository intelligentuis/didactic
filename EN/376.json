toxic friendships are just friendships that bring out the worst in you or don't serve you to some capacity. ab*sive friendships, on the other hand, are ... well, ab*sive. an ab*sive friendship is usually always toxic, but a toxic friendship doesn't necessarily mean it's ab*sive.\n  ","403465":"\n  i've been in toxic friendships, but not ab*sive friendships. i think like any other sort of ab*sive relationship it's going to be incredibly difficult to release yourself from them, but it may be easier with a support system backing you up and helping you.\n  ","403466":"\n  unless they totally ghost you, then no. not responding to your text isn't ghosting you ... and you should be having this conversation in person, not over text message.\n  ","403467":"\n  like i said, that's something you would have to ask them outright. it could mean different things to different people. you won't know their intentions unless you ask them.\n  ","403468":"\n  that sounds like they want to break up, but that's something you would have to ask them outright.\n  ","403469":"\n  their perception of my feelings and how i actually feel would be two different things in that scenario. it wouldn't be reason to break up, but i would ask them why they felt such a way and what i could do to ease their mind. it could be possible that perhaps i was taking advantage of the relationship or taking the relationship for granted without realizing it, and that i should do more to show my love and appreciation.\n  ","403470":"\n  i'm five feet tall.\n  ","403471":"\n  -- if someone isn't putting the same effort into a friendship\/relationship as you, then perhaps it isn't worth continuing. you should respect yourself enough to know if someone is taking advantage of you.\n  \n  -- life is unfair and things will happen that you don't deserve to happen to you. it's best to simply deal with these situations because if you question them relentlessly, you'll never come to terms with what happened or move forward.\n  \n  -- your own happiness and tranquility is important and you shouldn't invest time or energy into things or people that do not serve you. take time out of each day for self care and understand that you can only do so much in one day.\n  ","403472":"\n  one thing comes to mind, but it's too personal and terrible to really discuss on askfm. it happened many years ago, though, and sometimes i still feel regret.\n  ","403473":"\n  eh, for the most part. there are some things i'm totally irrational about thanks to mental illness, but it's gotten a lot better over the years.\n  ","403474":"\n  i received bad news on friday, but it isn't anything i can't handle at the moment. other than that, i don't really know what has shaken me recently. i try to approach situations from a calm and collected standpoint.\n  ","403475":"\n  there isn't really much you can do in that situation, unfortunately. if a person is unwell, they have to want help in order to truly better themselves. you can't force someone to seek professional help if they themselves are not ready to admit that they need help. it has to be on a voluntary basis.\n  ","403476":"\n  uh, there's only two but okay. lmaoo.\n  ","403477":"\n  yeah, i would never pursue someone if they were racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, etc etc.\n  ","403478":"\n  i don't know what it is you're referring to. can you be more specific?\n  ","403479":"\n  personality is more important to me. basing your attraction of someone off of their looks can only take you so far in a relationship, because your chemistry ultimately depends on how well your personalities mesh together.\n  ","403480":"\n  i had an inkling that i had certain disorders, but i never outright said that i *did* have those disorders until i was professionally diagnosed.\n  ","403481":"\n  that's partially a reason why i stopped using tumblr and trying to be part of the mental health community on there, tbh. not only did people romanticize mental illness but there was also so much misinformation being shared and people self-diagnosing without even wanting to seek professional help for their so-called \"diagnoses.\"\n  ","403482":"\n  without a doubt, yes. there's still a lot of stigma associated with mental illness (and mental health in general).\n  ","403483":"\n  been cleaning, organizing, and packing all afternoon. i'm legit exhausted & there's so much still left to do. ?\n  ","403484":"\n  tbh probably not. i don't have the time to create a costume and i definitely don't have the money to

but i'm also lazy and don't care very much.\n  ","403491":"\n  i don't wear those either, haha. most of my shirts are loose and the only \"tight\" things i prohably wear are leggings and skinny jeans.\n  ","403492":"\n  yeah, this happens with most boots that i try on tbh. they're usually too tall and hit somewhere around my knee, which can be uncomfortable.\n  ","403493":"\n  i don't like wearing outfits that are revealing or show too much skin. it isn't my style.\n  ","403494":"\n  to a certain degree, yes. i wasn't very comfortable in the outfit though.\n  ","403495":"\n  at the

the first time my job made me angry (well not the job itself, but one particular person i work with).\n  \n  i ended up talking to my supervisor about the situation because my coworker was essentially undermining her authority and disrespecting her and she has the right to know what's going on.\n  ","403505":"\n  the front facing camera is usually always in focus.\n  ","403506":"\n  yeah, the whole company votes.\n  ","403507":"\n  well, that would fall under the category of being dishonest. that's a problem then.\n  ","403508":"\n  depends on what he's saying to his ex, lol. if he's still being romantic with his ex or leading her on in any way then yeah -- that's unfair to both the new girlfriend as well as his ex.\n  \n  but if he's still friends with his ex because they didn't leave on bad terms, then i don't personally see the problem with him talking to his ex. it would only become an issue, i believe, if he's skipping out on quality time with his girlfriend to talk to or hang out with his ex or generally being dishonest.\n  ","403509":"\n  there will always be certain things of which we're unsure, and we may never know the true answers to them. it's just part of life.\n  ","403510":"\n  sounds like a natural progression to me.\n  ","403511":"\n  i do feel needed by some people in my life, all in different ways and some in bad ways and others in good ways. for those who express a need to have me in their life because my presence enriches it, then that makes me feel comforted and loved.\n  \n  i think whether it's good or bad to be needed ultimately depends on the type of need it is and your existing relationship with that person.\n  ","403512":"\n  like i said, communication is key. if you need to know the answer to something and if you're close to the person in that way then it's best to ask them.\n  ","403513":"\n  correct me if i'm wrong, but i was under the impression that a rebound relationship was one in which someone enters in the effort to make another person jealous.\n  \n  even if the man wanted to end the relationship in order to pursue someone else, if he's not doing it solely to make his ex jealous then i don't think it qualifies as a \"rebound.\" he's just being honest with his feelings.\n  ","403514":"\n  you could probably ask them about their feelings if you're close to this person in that way. regardless, it probably isn't any of your business to begin with, lol.\n  ","403515":"\n  long island pizza and bagels.\n  ","403516":"\n  depends on the individual, because it could go either way depending on the nature of both the previous and current relationship. some people have the capacity to be interested in others shortly after a breakup while others don't, so there isn't really a \"right\" answer to this question.\n  ","403517":"\n  yeah, they were mostly unhealthy thought patterns related to food. i used to deny myself food when i thought i didn't deserve to even eat because of something that i did that day, or i wouldn't allow myself to eat or drink something unless i accomplished something else in my life.\n  ","403518":"\n  this defines nearly half of the social gatherings with my family. they're supposed to be joyous occasions, but it normally gets very awkward and tense very fast.\n  ","403519":"\n  yes, there are perhaps one of two people who i wish were not in my life at the moment. i normally have no qualms with cutting people off or distancing myself, but these cases are a bit complicated unfortunately.\n  ","403520":"\n  in terms of atmosphere, i think tumblr is one of the worst out there. there are a lot of toxic cultures on tumblr who encourage problematic and negative thinking, as well as tons of misinformation, and it can really f*ck with the minds of the young, impressionable people who use that site.\n  ","403521":"\n  there's nothing wrong with a woman in a relationship hugging her male friends. if that's something that you as a partner would make a big deal over, then you need to look within yourself and figure out why you're so insecure about your relationship and find out how to remedy it.\n  ","403522":"\n  i would normally ask \"do you have a question?\" but i get the feeling that this isn't one of those cases.\n  ","403523":"\n  yeah, most people in my office are kind and try to make small conversation here and there, including my managers. most people are pretty easygoing, which i'm thankful for because it makes for a positive work environment.\n  ","403524":"\n  it depends on the day. some days, there is no reason and i see no reason to keep fighting. other days, i survive for the sake of others. sometimes i survive for myself. and then there are other times i survive because i believe in that moment that i deserve to see future moments of my life where i'm genuinely happy.\n  ","403525":"\n  driving home from work this evening. a song was on the radio that i could really relate to, and it really got me in my feels.\n  ","403526":"\n  i sometimes forget to take my medication in the morning because i'm in such a rush to get out of the house, ugh.\n  ","403527":"\n  depends on what the job being offered to me is. if i know it's something i'll absolutely hate then i would much rather choose to do something i liked with lesser pay. however, there's also nothing stopping most people from doing both (i.e. having a job to pay the bills and then doing what you loved on the side).\n  ","403528":"\n  i don't really follow any people who actively ask questions, but some people with good answers who are on most days are ;\n  \n

high boots.\n  ","403548":"\n  uh, you're anonymous. therefore, you're not even my friend. furthermore, i'm already in a relationship.\n  ","403549":"\n  it's a stereotype that most people don't get along with their step-mothers.\n  ","403550":"\n  it isn't something necessary for me to know, so if that's something they would want to share with me, that's their decision alone. someone's past doesn't necessarily reflect their present or their future.\n  ","403551":"\n  no, i'm not sure there's many people who prefer loneliness over anything else. there's a difference between solitude and loneliness and loneliness is a negative feeling. you can be alone without feeling lonely.\n  ","403552":"\n  i was talking to my therapist last week and i said \"flesh start\" instead of \"fresh

most of my clothing as well.\n  ","403555":"\n  i don't necessarily think it's bad, because if you have a good relationship with your family then they also can be your friend. but i would certainly need other people besides my family in my life, personally speaking.\n  ","403556":"\n  nah, i wouldn't want to be polyamorous because it would probably make me insecure, knowing that my loved one has more than one love in their life aside from me. i also don't have the capacity to love more than one person at once.\n  \n  i don't really have strong opinions about polyamorous people -- as long as

have a child, but it depends on the nature of how they forced the child. if they were yelling at the child then i would fire the babysitter.\n  ","403572":"\n  it's only happened on rare occasions, but no -- it doesn't upset him if i tell him he's acting irrationally. he prefers me to be honest with him in order to keep him grounded, and i wouldn't want to encourage irrational or bad behavior when i know that he can look at situations from a calmer perspective.\n  ","403573":"\n  he's a very difficult person to cheer up because when he's upset or angry, he feels it completely and it's all he can think about. however, i find it's best to just discuss his feelings with him and try to rationalize whatever he is feeling. he sometimes asks if his emotions are valid or if he's overreacting and i'm always honest with him.\n  \n  then i offer to play video games with him, which usually makes him feel better, lol.\n  ","403574":"\n  yes, his mood definitely affects me (although it happens with everyone i'm around). if he's upset about something, then i become upset also, and when he's very happy, then i feel totally euphoric.\n  ","403575":"\n  on the rare occasion, yes -- i've said no. usually it happens whenever i'm too mentally or physically exhausted to do something, i can't bring myself to get out of bed, or i'm just generally feeling unwell.\n  ","403576":"\n  no. i

said i preferred reading stories. i was a prolific reader and i have dozens upon dozens of books that i can't bring myself to donate. these days, however, i like watching stories on television because my attention span has greatly dwindled over the years.\n  ","403579":"\n  yeah, i definitely think so. i've already seen advertisements for video games on television.\n  ","403580":"\n  i mean, spamming someone with videos would just annoy them more than anything else and they probably wouldn't even watch the videos or read the articles. it's better to talk to them one-on-one.\n

emailed support and explained the situation, and they thankfully gave me my account back.\n  ","403582":"\n  there's so much stigma against men who have mental health problems, moreso than the stigma against women most of the time. due to toxic masculinity, men are conditioned from an early age to suppress their emotions and not talk about their feelings, otherwise they're considered \"weak.\" it's honestly a terrible thing to do for yourself health-wise and can lead to more problems in the future.\n  \n  one idea that can help is to simply talk about this stigma more and encourage the men in your life that it's okay to show emotions, it's okay to discuss feelings, and if they're struggling with mental illness, it's valid to seek help and there's nothing wrong with that. there's such a high rate of s*icide among men in today's society that something needs to be done, it's seldom talked about.\n  ","403583":"\n  to preface this, i will say that it's very difficult to change someone's mind about racism if they're racist themselves. often times, they were raised in a racist environment and their feelings toward people of other races is ingrained in them from a young age.\n  \n  one of the best ways to try, however, is to simply educate them. present them with facts and figures, point out their harmful views\/opinions, and reiterate that you do care about them but you don't want them to be hateful towards others simply because of their race.\n  ","403584":"\n  in a little over a week, i'll *finally* be moving out of my parents' house into my own house with two roommates. it hasn't happened yet, but i already know it will be the best thing to happen to me because i'll finally be able to heal from years of ab*se and move forward with my life.\n  ","403585":"\n  i care too much about people who don't seem to reciprocate the same feelings towards me.\n  ","403586":"\n  ultimately, my goal in life is to be content with myself and content with my life, attaining a level of

mental health\/mental illness. even though we as a society have improved somewhat with our perception of mental health, there is still so much progress that we need to do in order to take mental health seriously.\n  ","403610":"\n  good morning -- do you have a question?\n  ","403611":"\n  somewhere between an 8 and a 9. i'm quite concerned about climate change\/global warming, mostly because most other people who are in actual positions of authority seem to think it's a hoax, and i'm relying my faith in activists like greta thunberg and others to actually raise awareness to the right people and using their voice to convince others to implement change.\n  ","403612":"\n  i think so, yeah. it's all about setting boundaries with other people. while being cautious around others may be necessary for our own self-preservation, you can simultaneously trust someone just enough for them to do what they need to do while setting boundaries and keeping distance with them as well.\n  ","403613":"\n  everyone agrees with that too, especially my boyfriend and my best friend and my therapist. they all say this is going to probably be the best thing for my mental health at this rate and perhaps i can finally begin to heal.\n  \n  i'm sorry you've dealt with ab*se too and that you can't move out yet, but you should always keep your eyes on that goal because it *will* happen eventually and you'll be much happier and freer as a result. that's what has always driven me, the idea of freedom.\n  ","403614":"\n  i feel the same way as you, and i honestly believe that one of the better ways to go about the situation would be to wait until they have a clearer mind and then perhaps talk to them about your honest feelings. sometimes people have to \"sleep on it\" in order to feel rational and calm again, and also sometimes it only adds fuel to the fire when you're being honest with someone in the heat of the moment because they may construe it as you criticizing or invalidating them.\n  ","403615":"\n  this is perhaps one of the sweetest messages i've ever received. thank you so much !! while there are still a lot of struggles with my life rn, i also believe that i've improved somewhat over the past year especially with respect to work and my personal life (i.e. finally moving out and quitting smoking).\n  \n  i hope that moving out will finally provide me with a clean slate and i can only improve more from there. i need a sense of independence and not being restrained by my family, and it's going to be amazing to finally live my life without judgment from my family and doing things that i actually want to do without kickback.\n  ","403616":"\n  yes, i'm sure everyone does this from time to time. for example, displaying empathy for a person just to save face when you know that they're overreacting or being irrational, particularly if you know they'll just get more upset if you express that they're acting so. there's a time and a place for everything, and sometimes people need reassurance instead of the blunt, honest truth from time to time.\n  ","403617":"\n  i agree with this for the most part !! however, i think that all relationships come with some degree of stress because everyone will have struggles and challenges that they will have to overcome. you're experiencing life with that person by your side, so there will no doubt be times when there's miscommunication and you get stressed or angry with each other. what matters is that you both communicate with each other effectively and resolve issues.\n  ","403618":"\n  at work, i was initially a stand-in for the administrator of the magazine project while she was out on maternity leave. it was my temporary responsibility, but after she said she wasn't returning to work, it became my full-time responsibility. i've done everything for the latest edition of the magazine, from writing the actual articles to organizing the pages to corresponding with clients regarding their content to proofreading all 186 pages multiple times.\n  \n  when the final layout was revealed before we put the magazine online, my supervisor emailed me and said that she was immensely proud of me for not only taking on the responsibility with dedication, but for carrying on the torch and excelling with it. she said she was impressed with my ability to juggle both the writing aspects and editorial aspects of the project to create a nearly flawess edition and that i surpassed all expectations.\n  \n  i still have the email because i like reading it from time to time, lmaoo. it's a source of pride for me and keeps me going when i'm doubting myself.\n  ","403619":"\n  art in general, i.e. painting and drawing. i was a great artist when i was a teenager, but because i stopped doing art, my abilities have dwindled greatly.\n  ","403620":"\n  right now, i truly need some peace of mind and\/or a chance to start my life from a fresh slate. i'm hoping moving into the new house will provide me with that opportunity.\n  ","403621":"\n  i believe i'm pretty okay with what people know about me in general. i'm an open book for the most part, and i've always been open about my life because i would like to help others who are perhaps struggling with the same things that i've struggled with in the past.\n  ","403622":"\n  i believe my talents are pretty known by at least one or two people, considering i don't have many talents at all.\n  ","403623":"\n  eh, this is a complicated question because while it may be construed as shallow, i also understand it to some degree. in a relationship, there must be emotional chemistry as well as physical chemistry (if you're a s*xual type of person) and feelings should be reciprocated evenly. if you're not physically attracted to someone, then the relationship may not work out in the long run.\n  ","403624":"\n  the only thing that comes to mind is that i grind my teeth sometimes at night, which irritates my boyfriend because sometimes it prevents him from sleeping, lol.\n  ","403625":"\n  i suppose my biggest responsibility is the project i administer to at work, which is the magazine project. every day comes with different challenges, but because i feel dedicated and proud of the work i do, it comes easily to me so there's really not much i do to \"deal with it,\" so to speak.\n  \n  however, i do believe it's important to not take your work home with you, for lack of a better phrase. meaning, it's useless to stress about work when you're not at work, and you should only dedicate your time thinking about your job when you're actually there.\n  ","403626":"\n  unstable, creative, and ambitious.\n  ","403627":"\n  i trust my boyfriend with my life, yes.\n

months ago.\n  ","403630":"\n  tomorrow will be one month since i quit smoking cigarettes !! :'))\n  ","403631":"\n  to some degree, yes. i always try to put 110% into the work that i do, and i'm not satisfied with something until i feel as if there isn't any possible way i could improve it more. i also feel hesitant collaborating with other people because i can't trust them to do a good job, so in the past, i always hated doing group projects in school\/college.\n  ","403632":"\n  no, my parents are perhaps the only exception. i don't forgive them, but i don't hold a grudge against them either. i've accepted the fact that what happened to me has happened, but forgiving them for what they've done would be equivalent to me essentially telling myself that it was okay or acceptable, and i don't believe that to be true at all.\n  ","403633":"\n  for me personally, it depends entirely on the situation because every circumstance is different. most times, i do try to forgive & forget, but there will always be some situations where forgiveness isn't warranted or expected, and you simply cannot give the person another chance to redeem themselves.\n  ","403634":"\n  loneliness doesn't necessarily mean that you're physically alone -- you could be surrounded by people but still feel lonely because it's an internal feeling of isolation and sometimes hopelessness. it's a feeling of despair, where you feel disconnected from others and solitary in your thoughts. simply being alone, on the other hand, isn't necessarily a negative thing and a lot of people do enjoy their time away from other people.\n  \n  i don't really believe that comfort with being alone has any correlation with the capacity to love, although it may have ties with self-love as you're expressing a comfort with being by yourself and doing things in accordance with your own needs and desires.\n  \n  personally speaking, if i'm feeling lonely then i try to figure out why it is i'm feeling that way and also reach out to either discuss those feelings or at least distract myself from feeling lonely. i rarely get lonely these days, though, particularly because i feel like there's always something for me to do and i have a strong support system.\n  ","403635":"\n  idk, i guess a client could choose to sue us ... that would be one of the worse things that could happen in my profession.\n  ","403636":"\n  life in general, but moreso my family than anything else. now that it's less than two weeks until i move out, it feels as though my family is trying even harder to engage me and convince me to stay home by indirectly showing me how much they rely on me for everyday tasks. it's almost as if they're trying to make me feel guilty for leaving, and it's incredibly tiresome.\n  ","403637":"\n  i don't really know what i'm waiting for, tbh. i feel like i am waiting for something, but i really have no clue what it could be. there's always this feeling of something impending and that i won't know what it is until it eventually happens.\n  ","403638":"\n  honestly, i don't care enough to hold grudges anymore. it just ends up hurting me in the end, and it does nothing to the other individual, so why would i hold onto negative emotions when the only person it affects is me?\n  ","403639":"\n  i haven't used birth control in many years, lol. after the patch, i swore off the idea of using hormonal contraceptives.\n  ","403640":"\n  i apologized via email to my coworker for a bunch of last-minute revisions i had to give to her this week, haha. she's one of our office's graphic designers and she creates the layouts of most of our publications, and there have been so many little but significant changes that needed to be made over the past two days alone.\n  ","403641":"\n  i understand your frustration. unfortunately, there isn't much we can physically *do* to deter our loves ones from resorting to dr*gs or alcohol and whatnot, we can simply offer them tips and advice so that if they do decide to try them out, they'll have the knowledge they need to be responsible and safe.\n  \n  it's ultimately their decision, especially considering they're adults at the age of 18. but hopefully they do have the sense to be safe and not bite off more than they can chew if they decide to try dr*gs.\n  ","403642":"\n  it's considerate to offer money in order to chip in for gas, but it's not as if you're being forced to do so.\n  ","403643":"\n  i was not awake when you sent this to me, no.\n  ","403644":"\n  aw, thank you !! :'))\n  \n  my day was fine, rather slow actually. however, i found out that my office will be closed between christmas day & new years' day, which is very exciting. i've never had an entire week off from work before.\n  ","403645":"\n  yes, i was on birth control for quite a few years when i was younger beginning at the age of 17. my experience was mostly negative, tbh. i was on the pill first, and it caused weight gain and triggered my depression to worsen (which is actually very common but people seldom talk about it).\n  \n  after i was tired of the pill, i switched to the patch. the patch honestly wasn't much better & it significantly lowered my libido, which sorta ... defeats the purpose.\n  \n  however -- don't let this deter you, because everyone's bodies are different and just because i had mostly negative experiences doesn't mean that you will too. unfortunately, you won't really know how your body reacts until you try it first.\n  ","403646":"\n  life has been hectic, but good. i'm wrapping up the latest edition of the magazine at work (after *several* hiccups along the way, almoo) so that should be up and running by next week.\n  \n  i'm also continuing with packing for moving day, which is in less than two weeks. i got all of my bedroom furniture delivered, so now i just need to gather the remainder of my things.\n  \n  the only downside of everything is that i haven't seen my boyfriend in a week because we've both been so busy. :\/\n  ","403647":"\n  i've never been to a music festival before, and tbh i've never really had a desire to go. too many people, too much sweating, no room to walk or breathe, etc etc.\n  ","403648":"\n  my best friend's bachelorette party & then her wedding !! those were both amazing memories.\n  ","403649":"\n  i'm not sure if it works that way, lol. i know some people are comfortable with multiple pronouns, but you would have to ask that individual person what they use because everyone is different.\n  ","403650":"\n  depends on the situation. i'm hesitant to say yes to these types of questions because i simply don't know what's going to be asked.\n  ","403651":"\n  i don't believe it should be punishable by law, but it's most definitely disrespectful to refuse to use someone's correct pronouns.\n  ","403652":"\n  i have a picture of my boyfriend and i in a frame, two pop figurines (one of dogmeat from fallout 4 and

personal peace and acceptance within myself. to be content with myself and my life.\n  ","403686":"\n  over the years, i've learned to become more persistent and vocal about my goals and needs. i used to be quite timid in the past, but i realized that i wouldn't get anywhere if i was too afraid to speak out. when something is bothering me, i communicate. things have appeared much clearer ever since i made that transition.\n  \n  however, some things haven't changed very much. i'm still anxious as all hell when out in public, particularly in crowded places, and i avoid stores as much as i can. i

absolutely appropriate.\n  ","403697":"\n  i've had my struggles in life, much like anyone else, so i don't believe my life has been quite easy or kind to me. even in the present day when things are seemingly better, there is always *something* that happens that puts a damper on my outlook, as if i can never catch a break.\n  \n  i am quite exhausted, but my only option right now is to trudge onward.\n  ","403698":"\n  thankfully, i'm not very clumsy at all and i've only ever broken things on rare occasions. there was one time i almost dropped my ipad, though, and it slammed into the

develop through the meshing of your personalities.\n  ","403701":"\n  i never understood why random people think that this line of questioning is appropriate. not only is it incredibly invasive and vile, but you also wouldn't act this way around a total stranger in real life -- so why do the same thing on the internet?\n  ","403702":"\n  my answer is still no, lmaoo. i have zero desire to be

their life has played out, or their environment. people also have a tendency to attack things that they do not understand, especially if they were raised in a household that had a very strict, narrow perspective on certain issues and didn't allow the children to express themselves adequately.\n  ","403719":"\n  yes, i am still learning about who i am. i think most people learn more about themselves as they get older, because we're constantly evolving and adapting to our environments.\n  ","403720":"\n  not generally, no. i don't want people to worry incessantly about me, especially considering my s*icidal thoughts are usually passive, not active. i often feel hopeless & like dying, but i wouldn't act upon it.\n  ","403721":"\n  i'm not skeptical about them, but i've never

","403724":"\n  i honestly don't know. i think it's wrong for a person to tell a complete stranger that they're going to hurt\/off themselves because it places the responsibility on the other person, and no one should feel responsible for keeping someone alive like that. especially someone like me who already struggles significantly with my own mental health and s*icidal thoughts.\n

help to because i'm wary of putting my name out there in association with someone if i don't think they're a good worker.\n  ","403727":"\n  i don't usually feel vulnerable. because i'm open about my feelings and my life, it means i'm comfortable discussing them and it doesn't put me in a vulnerable position.\n  ","403728":"\n  i don't really get embarrassed, on my own behalf or other people's

\"complex\" with matters that are analytically-driven, complicated, and\/or difficult, with multiple steps and layers. on the other hand, i equate \"deep\" to matters that perhaps delve psychologically into things, have multiple meanings behind them, and are symbolic.\n  ","403733":"\n  i'm quite relaxed and serene rn. there were so few people on the road driving home from work

drinking it & listening to quiet music.\n  ","403734":"\n  it's okay to sit down and rest. it's okay to take a day off of work or school every once in a while if you're feeling burnt out. your body is telling you to slow down, and it's perfectly okay to listen. in our driven society, everyone is always running at full speed and we need to understand that it's normal and healthy to slow down or even stop temporarily.\n  ","403735":"\n  there's really nothing that can help when i'm in a depressive episode, but i do let people like my boyfriend or close friends know when i'm feeling that way just so that they're aware. i don't pretend that i'm fine except for when i'm at work, i try not to allow my personal feelings dictate my work style.\n  ","403736":"\n  nah, people are allowed to like what

an hour, so the children were screaming the entire time.\n  \n  now the children are gone, and the construction workers seem to have taken a break or maybe are done ... so perhaps i'll finally be able to finish my assignment. lmaoo.\n  ","403745":"\n  well, for one -- i don't believe i even want children to begin with. secondly, other people aren't dumb for having children, lol. if they're a good parent, then who cares.\n  ","403746":"\n  this is true, i was only basing it off of my understanding of new york's age of consent, which i believe is 17. i don't know what most other states are.\n

i'm sure.\n  ","403750":"\n  no, i'm drinking coffee.\n  ","403751":"\n  i've surprisingly never felt the need to take a break from social media over the years, tbh. social media is more of a way for me to relax and escape from my everyday life, as well as vent and connect with other like-minded individuals.\n  \n  the more that i think about it, if anything the only social media site that was harmful to me was probably tumblr because i followed blogs that were enabling and i noticed it kept me in an unhealthy frame of mind. i haven't used tumblr in over a year, though.\n  ","403752":"\n  i can't really fathom an \"ending\" to begin with, so i can't make a determination as to whether our ending will be happy or unhappy.\n  ","403753":"\n  their food tastes bad to me, lol. they're too greasy and every time i've had any sort of fast food lately, it's irritated my stomach.\n  ","403754":"\n  i can't stop thinking about moving out in two weeks.\n  ","403755":"\n  some happy endings do

just easier and i like the variety of different soaps you can buy from places like bath & body works. although, lemon-scented soap is perhaps one of my favorites.\n  ","403760":"\n  i like soaps with light fragrances, nothing that's too perfume-y or overpowering.\n  ","403761":"\n  i'm in a relationship.\n  ","403762":"\n  enforce much stricter gun regulations in the united states, and ensure that

","403764":"\n  no, i drive everywhere i go.\n  ","403765":"\n  most of the time, the generic brand of products work and\/or taste just as well as the name brand of the same thing, so i buy the generic version since it's usually much cheaper.\n  ","403766":"\n  i'm sure i have at some point, but it's never been made explicitly clear to me.\n  ","403767":"\n  i could be better, but i also could be much worse as well. i don't feel as angry as i did yesterday, but that's always apt to change as the day goes on.\n  ","403768":"\n  i don't know what websites you're looking at, but the gender neutral dolls that i just saw were of both white people and people of color.\n  \n  as an aside, i think it would also be great if they expanded the gender neutral options to disabled people as well.\n  ","403769":"\n  eh, for the most part i believe that you can simultaneously enjoy something that's \"problematic\" while also pointing out that said thing or person is problematic.\n  \n  however, cancel culture has also progressed now to the point where it's a bit ridiculous. i heard on the radio the other day that a reporter investigated a person who was doing a charitable deed and found tweets from when this person was 16 years old where he exhibited racist views, and so the reporter publicized it and suddenly the person's endorsements were taken back -- just because of a few tweets he sent when he was a dumb teenager.\n  \n  in instances like that, i think cancel culture is ridiculous because we're *all* done problematic things in our lives. we're no better than anyone else.\n  ","403770":"\n  from my understanding, i don't think intersex is considered a third sex because it's more of a genetic abnormality that ranges in characteristics of either male or female internal and\/or external parts and functions. for example, an intersex person may have both female and male gonads or a different range of chromosomes, and their sex hormones may differ from what's typically seen in those who are male or who are female.\n  ","403771":"\n  i'm usually fairly blunt and honest, so i've never had a reason to really be passive aggressive.\n  ","403772":"\n  i just looked it up briefly because i never heard about it before, but they seem to be a terrific idea. it's always good to have more inclusive representation, particularly when it involves children, and i like that they're being mindful of children whose gender identity doesn't align with what's stereotypically seen as \"typical\" in today's world.\n  ","403773":"\n  i honestly don't understand the fear that people have of trans people, it truly gives a new level to the term \"transphobia.\" you wouldn't be able to distinguish if the person next to you is trans or cis, and it makes me wonder if this is a genuine concern for cis people that they're afraid they're sharing the bathroom with trans folks.\n  \n  i agree that there should be more gender neutral bathrooms, it would simply make things easier for people, especially those trans people who honestly do not know which bathroom is \"best suited\" towards them.\n  ","403774":"\n  i understand your concern, but it's focused in the wrong places. a large majority of trans people aren't out to hurt other people, and the bigger threat to children would be cis people going out of their way to hurt them. a trans woman using her correct bathroom isn't an indication that she's out to hurt a child, because that's very discriminatory and transphobic to assume so.\n  \n  in the event that ab*se would take place, a simple bathroom sign wouldn't deter a criminal from doing what they want to do. it's not as if a p*do is going to look at the women's bathroom sign & say \"well this is the women's room, i can't go in there.\" lmao.\n  ","403775":"\n  i don't have a daughter. i don't really see how someone's stature and muscles have anything to do with their gender, either way.\n  \n  you sound overly concerned with what's in other people's pants, like what i just described. it's a bit bewildering.\n  ","403776":"\n  no one asked me about that, so why would i address it? that usually only happens with cis people anyway, a lot of cis people have a very unhealthy concern with what's in other people's pants.\n  ","403777":"\n  whatever bathroom they're most comfortable using.\n  ","403778":"\n  sounds like they've just moved on with their life, tbh. it's incredibly common to not keep in touch with people from school or work after you've moved on to something else, you're not going to remain friends with everyone you come across in life.\n  ","403779":"\n  yeah, i think it's important for parents to encourage their children to chase their dreams and if they work hard enough, then they can achieve whatever they set their mind to. however, this is also coming with the understanding that failure is inevitable and you shouldn't be deterred from your goals if you fail the first few times.\n  ","403780":"\n  i really have no idea, lol. i do know that if someone wants to commit a crime then they're probably going to find a way to do it one way or another, though.\n  ","403781":"\n  trans men go to the mens' room & trans women go to the womens' room.\n  ","403782":"\n  considering they're both capable adults, they're more than capable of cleaning up after themselves, lol.\n  ","403783":"\n  no, i've only driven small cars.\n  ","403784":"\n  i honestly have no idea. i never asked them.\n  ","403785":"\n  i've only ever video called my boyfriend once on snapchat, lol.\n  ","403786":"\n  no, i was never taught how to ride a bike.\n  ","403787":"\n  nope, i could never be involved in a profession like that.\n  ","403788":"\n  the name sounds familiar, but i don't think i know who that is.\n  ","403789":"\n

mind seeing a select few of my coworkers outside of work, although i've only ever hung out with two of them on the weekends.\n  ","403795":"\n  i finished most of my work and grabbed dinner with my coworker. i just got home a little while ago.\n  ","403796":"\n  yeah, i listen to the radio every morning and evening on my drive to and from work.\n  ","403797":"\n  of course, it's on the radio all the time.\n  ","403798":"\n  i'm all right. i just tried caribbean food for the first time & it was really good.\n  ","403799":"\n  a few people come to mind, people in my life who have passed away mostly.\n  ","403800":"\n  yeah, a few things have happened today which have really gotten under my skin and bothered me. i thought i would feel better if i took a nap & then restarted with a fresh perspective, but i've been feeling dreadful ever since i woke back up.\n  ","403801":"\n  i don't particularly believe that i'm a strong person (mentally, at least ... although physically, i'm very weak too).\n  ","403802":"\n  i can barely get out of bed rn, let alone leave the house and go to the gym. i appreciate the sentiment though.\n  ","403803":"\n  i just said, it's because i have zero motivation. lol.\n  \n  i'm honestly just sad and frustrated and angry. i just took a nap and all of these emotions came flooding back and i feel terrible all over again.\n  ","403804":"\n  you can choose which one you want, i believe. i think i purchased the 1 TB Xbox one console a few years ago.\n  ","403805":"\n  no, i've never been prescribed xanax before.\n  ","403806":"\n  i'm laying in bed, and i have a few things i need to do but no motivation to actually get up and do them.\n  ","403807":"\n  i'm sure i've had energy drinks that had ginseng as an ingredient.\n  ","403808":"\n  i don't remember much anymore. they all have meshed into one giant blob, at this point,\n  ","403809":"\n  i don't have the slightest idea.\n  ","403810":"\n  as far as i'm aware, some people still probably use it.\n  ","403811":"\n  unstable, creative, driven.\n  ","403812":"\n  cold cuts, probably.\n  ","403813":"\n  i never saw the purpose of slut shaming because someone else's sex life isn't your business, lol. if someone decides to have casual sex, then that's their decision. if it doesn't personally affect you, then i don't really see the reason to waste time and energy on it.\n  ","403814":"\n  i think it's generally a terrible idea, obviously. if you're with someone and you don't want to be with them anymore, you should have the maturity to talk to them about your feelings instead of going behind their back and cheat on them with someone else.\n  ","403815":"\n  you have to remember that it was your decision & your decision alone -- not theirs. you have control over what you do with your body, and something as personal as abortion isn't up to the decision of anyone else besides yourself.\n  \n  if someone is judging you for having an abortion, then it doesn't matter what they think at the end of the day. you did what was best for yourself at this time, and that's all that matters.\n  ","403816":"\n  i'm in a relationship, yes. even if i was single, that wouldn't mean that i was available.\n  ","403817":"\n  that's great if you want to day-drink as long as you're responsible about it. i won't be participating, though.\n  ","403818":"\n  no, i rarely ever day drink unless it's a very special occasion.\n  ","403819":"\n  i have zero clue as to what you're talking about.\n  ","403820":"\n  no, but i've been listening to video game soundtracks a lot lately.\n  ","403821":"\n  i have no idea what you're referring to.\n  ","403822":"\n  i answered this same exact question earlier this morning. however, to sum it up -- i prefer to plan things, but not very far in advance. most of my current plans have been rather spontaneous, being devised and then enacted within the same day.\n  \n  as for my weekend plans, i've been working all morning and i'm also planning on cleaning, doing laundry, and packing later today. i'm probably going to do the same thing tomorrow as well.\n  ","403823":"\n  like, do you mean talking to them and making sure they're okay or just checking up on them on social media?\n  \n  i think it depends on the situation. if you two ended on good terms, then it isn't unreasonable to talk every once in a while. however, this also comes with the risk of complicating emotions again or resurfacing feelings, which gets confusing. missing your ex is normal, unfortunately, but you don't want to hold them back or hold yourself back especially when you know you both can be happier without each other.\n  ","403824":"\n  no. nobody is perfect, we're all humans.\n  ","403825":"\n  i agree with you. if you apologize without admitting fault and without changing your behavior, then the apology is meaningless.\n  \n  you're misunderstanding me, though. when i was younger, i was fully convinced that situations that were not in my control were still my fault. apologies were demanded out of me, and because i was convinced that i was in the wrong, i berated myself and apologized profusely. it's taken me years to understand that those situations were not my fault.\n  ","403826":"\n  i like answering questions, especially when people feel comfortable enough with me to ask me for advice. i also enjoy reading my friends' answers and getting to know them better.\n  ","403827":"\n  i've found other people attractive, but i've never been romantically interested in anyone else while dating my boyfriend.\n  ","403828":"\n  kudos for trying to make sense, lol.\n  ","403829":"\n  quite the opposite, actually. when i apologize, i mean every single aspect of that apology, even when i'm not wrong. it's taken me years to realize that i wasn't actually wrong in those scenarios.\n  ","403830":"\n  this makes absolutely zero sense. kudos for trying, though?\n  ","403831":"\n  you're absolutely correct, i've ascended straight from hell itself.\n  ","403832":"\n  unfortunately, yes. i've been conditioned into apologizing for situations that weren't my fault to simply put an end to the situation entirely because i knew that if i fought back, it would just make things more difficult, even if i knew i wasn't in the wrong.\n  \n  i've gotten much better at standing up for myself over recent years, but i still have that apologizing behavior instilled in me, and my first instinct to pretty much anything is to apologize profusely.\n  ","403833":"\n  talk to your parents about the situation so that they can sit down with the other children's parents and school administrators to find a solution to the problem.\n  ","403834":"\n  i honestly don't remember, i'm sure i've had plenty of weird arguments with anons over the years, though. lmaoo.\n  ","403835":"\n  it's easy to hide aspects of your personality in-person as well. a person will only reveal about themselves what's most comfortable to them, whether that's online or in person. and i personally believe that everyone is a wee bit different in person compared to online anyway, simply because there's a slight disconnect between how someone can express themselves through text versus expressing themselves verbally.\n  ","403836":"\n  you don't need to meet a person face-to-face in order to love them. when you talk to someone often and get to know their personality, their interests, their opinions, and just in general how you two connect together, that isn't something only reserved for people who meet IRL.\n  \n  i love many of my online friends and i care about them deeply. just because i haven't met them face-to-face doesn't make my love for them less valid.\n  ","403837":"\n  well, as a friend -- yes. we don't talk that often anymore, but we do talk via snapchat occasionally.\n  ","403838":"\n  the \"best age\" depends entirely on the individual, as well as the couple, and there isn't really an ideal age that can be universal for everyone. for some people, it's in their early 20s. for others, it's not until much later in their lives.\n  \n  really, the best age to marry is the age where you feel most comfortable with your partner and can envision and look forward to spending the rest of your life with that person.\n  ","403839":"\n  yes. when i was a teenager, i had an online friend who i talked to every afternoon after school. we began talking when i was in middle school, and i didn't actually meet her in person until my first year of college. we grew to become best friends and i genuinely loved her, even though we didn't meet in person until years later.\n  ","403840":"\n  i was very jealous in the past of my friends whose lives seemed more \"put together\" than mine was, but eventually i realized that most people put up facades to give off the impression that they're stable when they're really not. you simply don't know what someone else is actually going through so it's useless to judge.\n  ","403841":"\n  lottery tickets. i've never purchased lotto before and i've never seen the point in playing lotto because there's a high probability that you'll never win, and often it's just a waste of money.\n  ","403842":"\n  uh, are you talking about me or the anon? lmaoo.\n  \n  if you're referring to me, then quite obviously this is not true considering i do love many people.\n  ","403843":"\n  i love them all equally. when you're in love with someone, their looks and personality and intelligence sorta mesh into one entire entity and you love them for everything that they are, not just parts of them.\n  ","403844":"\n  all of the above.\n  ","403845":"\n  i don't make grammatical mistakes very often on social media, although my use of grammar on social media is quite different from my use of grammar when i'm writing professionally, lol.\n  ","403846":"\n  waking up super early in the morning on the weekend when no one else is awake, making a cup of coffee, and

writing, both poetry and prose, is arguably the only skill i have, lmaoo. i've always prided myself on my ability to write and it's been my saving grace in a variety of instances.\n  ","403848":"\n  i've played a VR game once in my life, and it made me physically nauseous and dizzy so i couldn't continue playing it.\n  ","403849":"\n  i'm more apt to pick brains over physical beauty, particularly because beauty only goes skin-deep and it isn't an indication of how your relationship with a person will play out. you create chemistry with someone over how well you two relate, your shared interests, etc etc., and that isn't something dictated by beauty standards.\n  ","403850":"\n  i believe i would rather continue my life as it currently is. starting over means risking the chance of even worse things to happen, and i'm currently in a position that i wouldn't want to risk losing.\n  ","403851":"\n  i'm hesitant to say yes because i'm very critical about poetry and writing in general, so more than likely i'll probably hurt your feelings. i would rather avoid that.\n  ","403852":"\n  no, i'm fairly non-confrontational and i like to resolve situations quickly. if someone is so dedicated to fighting back and proving me wrong, then it says a lot more about them than it ever would about me. having the last word isn't necessary and you need to focus more on your own peace of mind than anything else.\n  ","403853":"\n  one of the most fun days i've had in recent years was my best friend's bachelorette party. we went out east to a wine-tasting tour on a big bus with only a few other guests, and everything was all-inclusive. we visited three different vineyards, one of which was technically members-only but they allowed us in anyway, and then the following morning, we went to the spa.\n  \n  i was with my best friend and the other woman in her bridal party, it was just the three of us and it was a lot of fun. :'))\n  ","403854":"\n  -- sunrises and sunsets.\n  \n

simply don't know how i'll be feeling on a particular day if i plan for something, say a week in advance. i could very much be into the plan the day we made it, but when that day comes, i could be feeling totally different.\n  \n  most of my plans are rather spontaneous these days anyway, usually happening within the same night as discussed. occasionally i'll text a friend or a friend will text me and ask if i'm available that same night, and then we might do something.\n  ","403861":"\n  of course it's possible. just because you deeply love someone doesn't necessarily mean that it's a healthy relationship, and also relationships are a two-way street. you may love and care for someone deeply, but if they don't feel the same towards you, then a reasonable thing to do would be to break-up.\n  ","403862":"\n  i've always wanted to color it like a sea green. :'))\n  \n  idk why i haven't done it yet tbh, but perhaps i'll try it soon.\n  ","403863":"\n  the last time i had a home-cooked meal was two nights ago, it was brown rice with veggies and steak. i ate take-out (well, delivery) last night from a local hero joint. i don't remember the last time i ate fast food tbh, but i believe it was wendy's. i like their chicken sandwiches.\n  ","403864":"\n  i seldom ask myself philosophical questions these days, simply because i either don't have the time to worry about stuff like that or because the topic in itself is meaningless.\n  ","403865":"\n  online, people assume i'm younger than i actually am and that i'm much taller than i actually am, lol.\n  \n  IRL,

give people attention much more often than i receive attention. tbh, i'm constantly checking up on my friends and i text a few people almost every day. sometimes i feel weird that i'm the one who

people there, so i'm probably not going to go.\n  \n  my other plans just include working on freelance assignments for my job, cleaning, and packing.\n  ","403875":"\n  my day wasn't anything spectacular. i woke up around 7:30am, worked for eight hours, and then came home. i've been home for about an hour & i'm just treating myself to an iced coffee because my commute was over an hour long. :\/\n  ","403876":"\n  i'm not a fan of trump, but i'm even less of a fan of the people who could potentially take over his position if he is impeached.\n  ","403877":"\n  yes, she made a new

much less creative now than i was in my formative years, mostly because i don't have much time to dedicate to writing creatively anymore.\n  ","403889":"\n  definitely not, haha. the idea of me being

They always say a joke is a joke and that I have no sense of humour or take things too seriously. I know no one should joke about r*pe, but then for Other stuffs I\u2019m beginning to think whether I\u2019m too sensitive or serious? I don\u2019t get along well with people my age because it seems like I don\u2019t find any humour in their \u201cjokes\u201d. I am funny, and I can make people laugh without bringing all that in, but they can\u2019t see it. :(\n  \n  --\n  \n  tbh, it sounds like you're hanging out with the completely wrong crowd of people. you're absolutely right in that jokes about mental illness, the lgbt+ community, and s*xual assault are very wrong. it's detrimental to those communities to use trauma and typical mental health symptoms as \"jokes\" or to portray them in a light where people don't take it seriously.\n  \n  i don't really think you're being too sensitive, because stuff like that bothers me too.\n  ","403897":"\n  they meant aesthetic, lol.\n  \n  like, your aesthetic is kinda like a theme or a vibe you give off with a social media presence. it's easier to have an aesthetic with social media pages like twitter, instagram, or tumblr. not so much askfm, but i suppose it is still possible with the answers you give and pictures you post.\n  ","403898":"\n  (cont) ... opposite. This is the reason why I am always very wary or cautious to be honest! Well I\u2019m not arguing or anything, just would like another perspective or something!\n  \n  --\n  \n  i totally understand. my close friends don't really have disordered eating habits (well, one of them does but it's a bit borderline and complicated), so when they're trying to lose weight, it definitely is in a healthy manner.\n  \n  those are just my close friends, though. i don't really like placing judgment on people with whom i'm not close because like you said, you don't really know their intentions, what they're doing, etc etc. if someone comes up to me and brings it up first, then perhaps i'll congratulate them. but otherwise, i don't say anything.\n  ","403899":"\n  i don't think i would use either of those terms to describe the idea of treating other people better than

however, over the past few years it's really presented itself to me and i had to make a lot of choices that were albeit difficult, but necessary for my own happiness and progress. it's terrifying to step forward into something and you don't know how it will turn out, but you also cannot stay put because then nothing changes.\n  ","403926":"\n  yes, quite a few times. my gut instinct generally

can feel their \"vibe,\" for lack of a better word.\n  ","403927":"\n  i've always thought that the way i could make the most impact on this world was by advocating for mental health awareness on social media because of the way you can reach thousands of people with just one post. i try to talk about mental health and illness whenever it's appropriate & the opportunity presents itself because mental health is stigmatized & more people need to talk about it.\n  ","403928":"\n  i used to have a real, genuine fear of change -- not like small changes like hair styles or colors, but major changes like job changes, lifestyle changes, etc etc.\n  \n  over time, i realized that my life wouldn't improve unless i took that daring step forward into the unknown. i couldn't hide within myself for my entire life because that only hinders progress.\n  ","403929":"\n  yeah, there have been several major turning points in my life. after my freshman year of college, i had to decide whether to continue in massachusetts or return home. when my mental health became bad three years ago, i had to decide whether to d*e or seek help. when my old job filed for bankruptcy, i had to decide whether to stick it through or find a new job. when the opportunity presented itself for me to move into a new house, i had to decide whether to stay home or take the leap and sign the lease.\n

the age of 12 or 13, a child should know how to cook basic meals. if there's ever an emergency where a child needs to cook because a parent is absent, it's important for them to know how to at least

better part of 5 or 6 years at this point, and the people i've talked to on this site have definitely opened my eyes to a lot of things, such as politics, mental health awareness, trans and lgbt+ rights, etc etc. i have quite a few people to thank for that, and most of them i also have added on other social media because i enjoy their presence.\n  \n  i've also met a select few people from

people are just naturally introverted or extroverted, or at least somewhere in between. no doubt, their traits may have also been influenced by environmental factors growing up, in which a person is conditioned into behaving a certain way out of fear. but for the most part, i believe it's something innate to a human being.\n  ","404112":"\n  i much prefer to be alone when i'm not feeling great mentally. i also have a tendency to self-isolate anyway, because i don't want to burden people with my sadness or feel as if they're obligated to help me.\n  ","404113":"\n  i don't really think it's necessary to let them down easy, if all they do is lie to you. they don't deserve to be let down easy because chances are, they know what they're doing to you and they simply don't care. for most

health, the prison system, true crime, and the environment.\n  ","404140":"\n  it's a parent's job to ensure that their chil(ren) are attending school and doing their best to ensure their education. if a child is skipping class and the parents know about it and don't care, then that's negligent.\n  ","404141":"\n  if my child has a job, then clearly they're over the age of 16 so i feel as if standard \"punishments\" would be a bit outdated. i would question them and ask why they got fired and simply talk to them, it's not as if i would ground them or something because that doesn't help the situation at all. but i would definitely sit down and have a serious talk about the matter because jobs are important and i would want my child to have a good work ethic.\n  ","404142":"\n  i'm going to be honest with you -- he sounds like he's *very* insecure himself. asking for photos of what you're doing throughout the day is a bit much, and i understand that perhaps he doesn't feel like he can trust you entirely, but i feel like he's taking things too far.\n  \n  you're perfectly valid in not wanting to send full body shots if you dislike your body, and honestly i don't see any reason why he wants to see that anyway when you've clearly sent him other photos of yourself. the fact that he's being so impatient with this makes me wonder if he has another motive behind it (but that's just me, i'm a paranoid person by nature).\n  \n  it's obviously up to you if you want to continue your friendship\/relationship with him. but if he's going to keep acting like this towards you, then that's very toxic and unhealthy.\n  ","404143":"\n  i participated last year, yeah. i bought a cheap wood elf costume off of amazon, lol.\n  ","404144":"\n  three of my coworkers and i take breaks at the same time, and out of all of us, only one of them smokes cigarettes. the rest of us vape. it doesn't make me want a cigarette, though.\n  ","404145":"\n  UGH, YES. honestly, for me the best thing in the world was waking up on a saturday morning with a hot cup of coffee and a cigarette outside on my back patio. it was my reason for getting out of bed in the morning.\n  \n  i actually tested myself two days after quitting by going to the bar with a friend and seeing if i could last drinking alcohol without having a cigarette. i didn't have anything on me except my vape, and i timed my vape breaks to four minutes (and i think i only took two vape breaks).\n  ","404146":"\n  i would be hella disappointed in myself if i did.\n  ","404147":"\n  it depends on the individual, i think. some people function better if they quit gradually or with a smoking cessation aid while others quit cold turkey.\n  ","404148":"\n  quitting cigarettes has honestly made me SO FREAKING HUNGRY. i didn't think it was true that people got hungrier when they quit, but for a solid 5-6 days, i was insatiable. that's why a lot of people gain weight when they quit smoking, since smoking does suppress the appetite.\n  ","404149":"\n  money, lmaoo. most of my problems could be solved if i had more money, sadly enough. i *think* i'll have enough to get by once i start renting, but we'll see.\n  ","404150":"\n  i don't feel like a boss, but i certainly feel much better both physically and mentally.\n  ","404151":"\n  it was abruptly, but i've been vaping in the meantime. i just stopped buying cigarettes two sundays ago after i smoked the last of my pack and switched to vaping instead.\n  ","404152":"\n  don't get me wrong, i was making excuses for a long ass time. i simply didn't want to quit, but eventually i realized how much it was harming me and how much money i was wasting on it.\n  \n  my boyfriend recently quit too, and i figured if he could quit smoking two packs of cigarettes per day then i can quit as well.\n  ","404153":"\n  i mean, it's askfm. i'm not really here to have conversations, lol.\n  ","404154":"\n  i didn't want to feel terrible anymore, in a physical sense. i was coughing up my lungs every morning, for example. i also wanted to save money because i smoked a pack a day and cigarettes run around $10\/pack where i live.\n  ","404155":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","404156":"\n  i quit smoking almost two weeks ago.\n  ","404157":"\n  i'm cold towards most people in my life, and i love my boyfriend & close friends to an extreme.\n

have bits of ukraine, ireland, austrian, and english in me.\n  ","404160":"\n  absolutely. teachers are overworked and underpaid.\n  ","404161":"\n  probably not. my office has a costume contest every year but i don't think i want to participate this year.\n  ","404162":"\n  kudos to you for quoting me verbatim, rofl. it doesn't happen often enough for me to put into my bio, it isn't something i

LOL.\n  \n  in all honesty, it depends on who the person is and the relationship you have with that person already. it varies wildly so there's really no universal answer to this question.\n  ","404168":"\n  i mean, teachers are obviously within their rights to send students to detention and in-school and out-of-school suspension. i don't see what other forms of \"punishment\" there could be.\n  ","404169":"\n  no, i would never work in new york city. i wouldn't be able to handle the commute.\n  ","404170":"\n  i've trained new hires before, it was part of the job. i was neither tough nor lenient for the most part. i told them what i expected, but i also took my time with them and allowed them the comfort to ask any and all questions.\n  ","404171":"\n  i'm working non-stop all day, aside from my two 15-minute breaks and my lunch break. i don't talk to anyone because i'm too busy with my daily tasks, and i'm always trying to put in 110% every day. i've always been extremely meticulous.\n  ","404172":"\n  i didn't really do anything specific. i just kept getting promoted because my boss recognized my work ethic and noticed that i was efficient with not only helping customers but also keeping track of orders and learning things quickly. i started out as a cashier, then went on to become a photo technician, photo supervisor, and pharmacy technician.\n  ","404173":"\n  no, there was one office for everyone. i worked in a drug store when i was in management.\n  ","404174":"\n  no, definitely not. i worked in retail for four years of my life, and i encountered a lot of customers who were wholeheartedly wrong.\n  ","404175":"\n  poor customer service can be defined in many ways, but for me personally, i consider customer service to be poor when you can clearly tell that the representative isn't putting any effort into actually helping you and just want the conversation to be over with. they may be a bit rude or seem hesitant to help, and in some cases, they may make your situation worse.\n  ","404176":"\n  no, bosses don't owe anyone anything, especially if the termination is within the three month probation period. most people don't particularly care about what's better for their employees or not -- not saying it's right, it's just the honest truth.\n  ","404177":"\n  my plans for autumn don't differ much from the rest of the year, haha. moving day is in a little over three weeks, i still have to obtain my passport for the cruise in february, and i want to definitely visit the wineries out east at least once this fall.\n  ","404178":"\n  it all depends on what their opinions are, and there's a large difference between having an opinion and expressing a viewpoint that's oppressive toward others. personally speaking, i wouldn't be able to remain friends with someone if they expressed views aligning with sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia or ableism (just to name a few).\n  ","404179":"\n  -- my favorite flower is yellow roses.\n  \n  -- my favorite season is autumn.\n  \n  -- my favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough.\n  \n  -- my favorite gemstone is either mystic fire topaz or white opal.\n  \n  -- my favorite hot beverage is coffee.\n  ","404180":"\n  personally speaking, yes -- my present is much better than my past for many reasons. i'm constantly striving to improve myself and my relationships, meanwhile in the past i had no ambition or drive whatsoever. i was overcome with emotions related to trauma; however, over time i've learned to accept what had happened to me and do my best to move on in spite of how it has affected me.\n  ","404181":"\n  i've definitely matured a lot over the past few years, both emotionally and in terms of my behavioral responses to stimuli in my life. i used to be very obsessive, neurotic, immature, insecure, and always looking for an escape from my pain. i would get drunk and high all the time, and i was generally just wasting my life away.\n  \n  these days, i don't really get high anymore except on very rare occasions. i only drink once per week and i don't get blackout drunk anymore like i used to. i've calmed down a lot and i don't obsess over things anymore, and i've learned how to accept situations and let them go for my own peace of mind.\n  ","404182":"\n  coral that can be found in the ocean that people can also grow in salt water tanks are either aggressive or peaceful organisms. i knew that regular fish are characterized as being docile, semi-aggressive and aggressive, but i didn't know that coral that those traits as well until this morning.\n  ","404183":"\n  i receive repetitive questions on an average basis, particularly questions that ask how old i am, where i live, what my job is, etc etc. (everything that's already in my bio, lol.)\n  \n  ideally, i would love to be asked more questions about mental health and illness, my hobbies in general (i.e. video games, writing, painting, photography), my relationships, my career & education, and my opinions on controversial topics.\n  ","404184":"\n  in terms of relationships, yes. there have been a lot of people who i had a crush on but i knew i could never date them.\n  ","404185":"\n  eh, neither? i tend to be more of a realist than anything else. i'm not very optimistic because i don't like to be disappointed, but i'm also not pessimistic because pessimism only hinders growth.\n  ","404186":"\n  it isn't really unusual, but i've slept in my car before.\n  ","404187":"\n  emotional stability, financial stability, and interpersonal stability within my friendships\/relationships.\n  ","404188":"\n  i don't talk out loud to myself very often unless i'm playing video games or driving, lol. i talk to myself within my head all the time, though.\n  ","404189":"\n  ugh, their food is disgusting.\n  ","404190":"\n  any sort of math, particularly algebra and calculus. i knew i was going to pursue a career in english,

me, because that only leads to worse behavior and danger down the road.\n  \n  kids are going to do what they want one way or another, so i can only hope that if i have children that they'll feel comfortable enough to come to me because they wouldn't fear my reaction.\n  ","404216":"\n  my loved ones abandoning me, particularly my boyfriend. it's irrational because he constantly reassures me

either, especially when it comes to our daily life or our opinions.\n  ","404244":"\n  i'm never around small children so i honestly have zero idea of how to interact or talk to them when i *am* around them. i'm ridiculously awkward.\n  ","404245":"\n  does fox mulder count ?!\n  ","404246":"\n  i say \"knew.\"\n  \n  please don't tell me you're trying to start drama over grammar.

now i'm just waiting until my therapy appointment.\n  ","404250":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","404251":"\n  this is probably the most random answer anyone has sent me, rofl. what was the point of sending me this.\n  ","404252":"\n  no, they're chewed down with chipped nail polish. nothing great looking.\n  ","404253":"\n  yeah, i still play video games.\n  ","404254":"\n  if i was, then i wouldn't have answered it.\n  ","404255":"\n  i don't believe i did, but i honestly don't remember.\n  ","404256":"\n  yeah, a few times in the past. it's been quite a few years though.\n

failed the first try, but passed on the second attempt.\n  ","404260":"\n  depends on what the question is, but sure.\n  ","404261":"\n  having a salary would be nice, LOL. but i worked in management when i worked in retail, there's no way in hell i'm ever going back to that.\n  ","404262":"\n  yeah, that's pretty much how i used to work. now i'm not in a management position anymore, which i'm absolutely fine with. it was stressful and i wasn't getting paid nearly enough for what i used to do.\n  ","404263":"\n  i basically used to tell them to suck it up, lmaoo. no one likes working, but a job is a job. you're not going to like the tasks given to you, but they must be done. to neglect the task at hand is going to negatively affect every other operation.\n  ","404264":"\n  i've supervised people in the past, and although initially i was uncomfortable with managing others, i slowly became more confident in my role and liked delegating tasks to people and watching my employees succeed.\n  ","404265":"\n  i believe it's better to be forthcoming and tell them outright that they didn't get the job, tbh. escorting someone out of the building without indicating why is a bit harsh, unless they were acting out in some way.\n  ","404266":"\n  i would feel bad for them, but it wouldn't change my mind.\n  ","404267":"\n  aw, thank you. i really appreciate that.\n

a manager should be strict but also understanding. if a manager is simply strict and will not understand each person's individual situation, then yes -- that definitely turns people off and severely lowers morale.\n  ","404272":"\n  thanks, me too.\n  ","404273":"\n  yes, the very least they can do is tell their employee the underlying reason behind why. people rely on their hours for money obviously, and when hours get cut, it can really hinder someone.\n  ","404274":"\n  i would be strict, but i don't think i would be unreasonable. however, if someone is chronically late or they're using their cell phone so much that it's impeding on their work, then yeah i would definitely call attention to that and bring up the issue to HR.\n  \n  you have to keep in mind that we're all human, we make mistakes, and no one is perfect. if someone doesn't normally use their phone, but you notice that they're on their phone a lot one day, then they likely have a justifiable reason behind it. same with being late or being absent from work.\n  ","404275":"\n  not in my current company, no. first, i wouldn't want to dethrone my current supervisor because she's amazing, and second, the management position for my department deals mostly with upper management & i ain't about that life.\n  ","404276":"\n  uh, like regular garlic? yes.\n  ","404277":"\n  thank you !! it isn't really

happened to me way too many times to count. :\/ particularly with my family.\n  ","404287":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry.\n  ","404288":"\n  i don't really understand what you're talking about.\n  ","404289":"\n  no, i don't generally notice who gives me likes unless they go through my entire page and like 10+ answers in a row. even so, i don't check out their page.\n

uncomfortable.\n  ","404291":"\n  where was i angry? i was just telling anon to cut the sh*t. i don't like when people idolize me, it makes me uncomfortable.\n  ","404292":"\n  yeah, it was pretty exciting when i learned that my office building has an entire cafeteria in it, lmao. my favorite part is that they serve starbucks coffee.\n  ","404293":"\n  well, the cafeteria serves pizza. the cafeteria is open for everyone for works in the office building, it isn't just my company there.\n  \n  also, drop the bullsh*t. it isn't cute.\n  ","404294":"\n  i don't really care what other people do with their hair or bodies.\n  ","404295":"\n  i got a slice of pizza from the cafeteria at work, if that counts.\n  ","404296":"\n  because of the implication that one partner is reverting back to a childlike, innocent state in order to fulfill a sexual desire. it's concerning and uncomfortable.\n  ","404297":"\n  yes, i've been with the same stylist for about a year now. she's the one who's been coloring my hair purple, pink, blue, and orange. she's so talented.\n  ","404298":"\n  aw, thank you !!\n  ","404299":"\n  LOL. it was an impulsive decision, but i've been very happy with it.\n  ","404300":"\n  i honestly don't remember exactly how. i started smoking my freshman year of college, i think it was due to stress and my roommate smoked at the time too. i just picked up the habit.\n  ","404301":"\n  that's why i said it's inconclusive. vaping has only been around really for 11-12 years, i think.\n  ","404302":"\n  it's pretty inconclusive. all of the news reports about people dying from vaping actually had THC oil in their system, not just the regular nicotine vapes. so people are misunderstanding that left & right and assuming all vaping is bad.\n  \n  vaping is a much better alternative, particularly for those quitting cigarettes. there aren't nearly as many chemicals, toxins, and carcinogens if you compare them to cigarettes from my understanding, and you can choose the level of nicotine and steadily decrease as you go.\n  ","404303":"\n  i feel that, man. i smoked since i was 17 years old, initially it wasn't many but then i gradually increased to smoking a pack a day. the calming factor deterred me too, that was a main reason why i didn't quit sooner.\n  \n  however, i've been vaping here and there instead of smoking cigarettes as a transitional thing, and it's been helping a lot.\n  ","404304":"\n  i'm fine, feeling much more stable today than i felt the past two or so days. i still have a lot of freelance work to do, but i stupidly just keep scrolling through social media.\n  ","404305":"\n  it's free for android phones. you'll have to look it up and see in the app store.\n  ","404306":"\n  it's called quit tracker.\n  ","404307":"\n

having campfires, receiving positive reinforcement re: my writing and ability to work, forehead kisses, and writing something i'm proud of.\n  ","404309":"\n  i wasn't popular by any means, so i was somewhat of an outsider. however, people still knew who i was because of my artistic background & i was actually voted \"most artistic\" of my graduating class.\n  ","404310":"\n  emotional\/spiritual pain is much harder for me to deal with. i can handle physical pain just fine because i know most pain is temporary, but because i feel emotions so deeply, i can be in emotional pain for weeks on end with no relief in sight.\n  ","404311":"\n  the show it's always sunny in philadelphia. regardless of how i'm feeling, that show always has me cracking up.\n  ","404312":"\n  i'm going to answer this in terms of writing, since i don't really draw or paint much anymore. however, my artistic voice in my writing and sense of style has been developed over the course of like two decades, since i've been writing from a very young age. what has helped me hone my voice is the adoption and experimentation of other writers' voices over time. when i was a teenager, i would read books and try to implement the author's voice into my own writing, and then branch off from there.\n  \n  even now, it's something i actively work towards. although i have a more refined sense of style and voice in my writing as an adult, i do question it sometimes and editing your work is more important than writing the first draft itself.\n  ","404313":"\n  let go of things that don't serve you. above all else, your top priority in life should be your own health and wellness, and it becomes toxic to hold onto negative feelings and people, as it hinders your own progress. there's nothing wrong with letting go of people who perhaps once served you in the past, but don't anymore. not everyone is meant to be in our lives indefinitely.\n  ","404314":"\n  my day has been fine, considering i've only been awake

the house today.\n  ","404315":"\n  it's genetic, actually. my father's side of the family has always had really thick hair (it's the italian side of me).\n  ","404316":"\n  why would i turn off anon? that would eliminate half of my question base, rofl.\n  ","404317":"\n  people are not obligated to date someone simply because they're interested in them. if you're not interested in dating a person, then you have every right to turn down the date, regardless of the reason why.\n  \n  also ... the \"friendzone\" isn't actually a real thing.\n  ","404318":"\n  they don't bother me, tbh. if they're too insecure and cowardly to hide behind anon, then why should i invest my own time and emotions into their responses? it's pointless and wasted energy.\n  ","404319":"\n  i don't remember his first reaction, that was so many years ago. but yes, he did know and actively did try to help me stop.\n  ","404320":"\n  i never said i had an eating disorder. i said that i have disordered eating -- big difference between the two.\n  ","404321":"\n  they probably didn't know and\/or care because that was only one month after i was born, so they were probably preoccupied with taking care of me and my brother.\n  ","404322":"\n  i've screwed up my metabolism because i only usually eat once, sometimes twice, per day on most days -- especially when i'm going through some sort of emotional crisis. there's no routine to my eating habits, and i fluctuate between not eating anything at all and then binge eating.\n  ","404323":"\n  actually, yes. i seldom talk about this because i know the topic is very triggering for some people, but if it wasn't for him, i wouldn't have had the motivation to stop SHing. he showed me that he gave a sh*t, meanwhile others didn't, and my interest in him gave me a reason to recover.\n  ","404324":"\n  yes, we met when i was 16 years old. i didn't stop SHing until i was 17 or 18 years old.\n  ","404325":"\n  yes, i am a 1991 baby.\n  ","404326":"\n  i wouldn't have started engaging in SH when i was 11 years old. it destroyed the entirety of my teenage years,\n  ","404327":"\n  i believe i have, yes.\n  ","404328":"\n  yeah, it's ridiculous. especially those trending videos where people literally purchase food items and then throw them out to show that they're gross. smh.\n  ","404329":"\n  i didn't hear about that, i don't know if that would necessarily make headlines in the united states because similar things happen here all the time.\n  ","404330":"\n  yes, i gained like 50 pounds over the past two years.\n  ","404331":"\n  occasionally, yes.\n

tried a pair or two on, but they never fit me quite right because they're usually *way* too big for me. i'm very short, lol.\n  ","404340":"\n  i don't believe they should be completely free, but they *should* definitely be way more affordable. pads, tampons, and sanitary wipes should be less expensive than they are now, and not taxed at all. in addition, things like glasses and contacts and eye examinations all fall under health care, and health care in general should be far less expensive than it actually is. honestly, half of the reason why i haven't seen my eye doctor in almost four years is because the cost of the examination and cost of my glasses and lenses is way too pricey.\n  ","404341":"\n  uh, i think around 40 hours? it wasn't terribly long, but it was long enough to the point

my best to be a good friend, and i would like to think that i am. i care about my friends' well beings more than i care about my own.\n  ","404349":"\n  people have said i resembled her. i just explained this, lol.\n  ","404350":"\n  i suppose any of the necklaces my boyfriend has bought me over the years. they're very sentimental to me.\n  ","404351":"\n  no, i almost never wear hats. if

advocate for mental health awareness, and i enjoy educating people on misconceptions of mental illnesses.\n  ","404354":"\n  graduating from college. i went from failing two classes my freshman year

expectations.\n  ","404355":"\n  (cont) ... Etc? My psychiatrist says it\u2019s normal for people with BPD to feel this way but it still hurts me so. I feel bad for distrusting them but my heart and brain says I can never fully trust anyone. It\u2019s exhausting and frustrating to know that the only people you can talk about your deepest feelings are Yourself and the people on internet that don\u2019t know your identity because that\u2019s the best way to protect yourself.\n  \n  --\n  \n  i understand how you feel. honestly, i don't believe they're \"doomed to fail\" or anything extreme like that, but nevertheless, you do need to work on the underlying causes of your distrust in people and work on bettering your relationships. you're only hurting yourself in the long run because a lack of trust isolates you, particularly in relationships where you should feel comfortable trusting a close friend or partner.\n  \n  you mentioned a psychiatrist, but do you see a therapist? i believe therapy would be helpful if you don't currently have counseling.\n  ","404356":"\n  snapchat selfies from last february ;\n  ","404357":"\n  i went to a comedy show last year to see dan soder, and he had me laughing so hard i

it's right or okay. most people deserve to be with someone with whom their feelings are shared. a relationship is not balanced or healthy if someone feels stronger than the other, i.e. one partner being romantically involved but the other not being romantically involved. if you're not attracted to your partner romantically, then that's a conversation that you two need to have. you shouldn't settle for your partner if you don't love them on a romantic level, that's unfair to both of you.\n  ","404362":"\n  i believe that's completely unacceptable. you should be compensated for the hours you provide to your work, regardless of whether or not a mistake was made. we're only human and mistakes are bound to happen (lord knows i've made a hell of a lot of mistakes during my career).\n  \n  if a mistake is bad enough, then obviously that warrants an HR visit, a write-up, a stern talking-to, or even termination. but to take that out of a worker's weekly wages is a bit extreme, imo. people need money to survive, and most people live paycheck-to-paycheck.\n  ","404363":"\n  thanks, my dude ~~\n  ","404364":"\n  yikes, sorry it took me three days to respond !! i have so many questions in

in particular just for answering her question honestly.\n  \n  in addition, just because someone supports an idea or thinks that it might be interesting doesn't necessarily mean that those ideas or events are going to even happen. relationships are a two-way street, and obviously she's quite uncomfortable with the prospect of that event happening -- therefore, it would never actually happen since there needs to be consent from both sides. like i said, i understand why she would be bothered by the *idea* of it, but in practical terms, there's nothing to be upset over because it won't actually happen.\n  \n  i hope this makes sense. lmaoo.\n  ","404365":"\n  i don't support the death penalty. even though i know there are such things as \"lawful killing\" and \"unlawful killing,\" i

discourage you from asking someone out on a date if you're interested in them.\n  ","404375":"\n  i'm going to be quite frank -- i don't eat lunch most days. on the weekends, i simply don't get hungry so i only eat a late breakfast and then dinner. on the weekdays during work, i'm so caught up in my work that i forget to eat.\n  \n  i would much rather have a light snack than an actual lunch,

don't really remember much about how my hometown was when i was a kid, but from my understanding, the entire area in general has become much more dangerous. it wasn't unheard of for kids to play in the streets and walk or bike to their friends' houses, even approaching the night time. i used to walk home from high school all the time without thinking twice about it.\n  \n  these days, that's rare. you don't see children playing outside in the streets anymore unless a parent is with them. you don't see anyone walking outside anymore. i don't know if it's simply because times have changed or also in recognition of the danger that has increased in the area, ranging from things like robberies and break-ins to drunk drivers and whatnot.\n  ","404377":"\n  it would be lovely if the boss of

innately is. no one chooses their sexual orientation.\n  \n  we have both been in relationships with men and women in the past, and it does not bother either of us (and ideally, it shouldn't bother anyone at all). to be bothered by someone's past sexual history if they were with the same sex or gender is pretty homophobic.\n  ","404388":"\n  yeah, i would say that's classist of you to believe. someone's work or income level isn't an indication of who they are as an individual, and simply speaking, some people have more privilege than others especially in terms of professional opportunities. a pizza delivery driver deserves just as much respect as a doctor, not only because their profession does *not* define them, but also because you simply do not know the path someone's life has taken for them to get to that point.\n  \n  the pizza delivery driver could actually be working 3 jobs to keep their family afloat, and you simply would not know it. the doctor could have experienced privilege their entire life and fell into their profession because they were graciously provided a loan and didn't have much trouble affording their career path.\n  \n  not to mention, it's *so* much more difficult now to afford proper schooling than it ever was in the past. people used to be able to work a summer job and afford college the following semester ; these days, that's literally impossible. so all of these things have to be taken into account before you pass judgment on someone for having an entry-level or minimum wage job.\n  ","404389":"\n  yes, i very much have experienced the same thing re: my own mental illnesses too. it's difficult coming to terms with the fact that *you* may be the toxic\/problematic one, even if those behaviors do stem from having mental illness. however, just because we're mentally ill doesn't mean that our toxic behavior is justified, and we need to be held accountable for ourselves just like anyone else.\n  ","404390":"\n  i purchase most things from amazon. i don't shop online much anymore unless i need something that's difficult to find in stores.\n  ","404391":"\n  this is one of those gray area ordeals, unfortunately. generally speaking, it's wrong to ditch people simply because they're mentally ill. *however*, if that person's mental illness is causing them to act out in toxic behaviors and they're not taking responsibility for their actions or thoughts, then they should be held accountable regardless of whatever illness they have.\n  \n  generally speaking, mental illness is not an excuse for poor behavior. if your friend who is mentally ill is incessantly negative and it drains everyone around her, then perhaps she does need to be spoken to about perhaps seeking help (or seeking more intensive help if she's already in treatment). there's a difference between being depressed and trying to live life to the best of your ability, and being depressed and not putting any effort into making your situations better.\n  ","404392":"\n  yeah, that's only happened to me on a handful of times but it does anger me greatly. it's very disrespectful.\n  ","404393":"\n  emotional fortitude\/strength, assertiveness

their calls anymore.\n  ","404396":"\n  if the tip for the delivery person is figured into the total, then i guess you're not obligated to tip them on top of that. however, every time my family has had groceries delivered to the house, we tip the delivery person in cash because it isn't guaranteed that they'll actually see that prefigured tip in their pocket.\n  ","404397":"\n  that's disgusting. that's literally incest, lol.\n  ","404398":"\n  i mean, i honestly would apologize if i was in your position. it doesn't necessarily matter if you believe the portrait is accurate to a

the bank to deposit or withdraw money, i wouldn't have a problem doing so.\n  ","404405":"\n  neither. i grew up middle class, so while we did have enough money to get by and weren't technically poor, we also were not rich by any means either.\n  ","404406":"\n  oh my ... you are quite confused, my friend.\n  \n  non-binary is a gender identity. it essentially means that i do not identify as either of the gender binaries (\"man\" and \"woman\"), my gender exists in between. it's part of the transgender spectrum.\n  \n  your gender identity is not correlated with your sexual orientation. you can be trans or non-binary and be heterosexual, or homosexual, or bisexual, etc etc. personally speaking, i *am* bisexual but it doesn't have anything to do with my gender.\n  \n  to address the third part of your message -- no, being bisexual does not affect my current relationship. it isn't a personal indication that my partner \"cannot please\" me, bisexual simply means that i find more than 2
