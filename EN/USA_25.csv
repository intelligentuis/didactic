  not anytime soon? I can't predict the future though. If both of my accounts got banned I doubt I'd make another. If ALL of the people I currently follow left then I'd consider leaving. But honestly, it's a good brain exercise and bit of entertainment for me so here I stay

  I'm not really sure. some reasons I suspect mania are: hyperfocus on art/being productive, disorganized thoughts (Which is really more of a schizophrenia thing though), Small delusions about trauma-inspired things (for instance I tried to convince my husband that my cat was dying but I think after his inspection and logical conclusions that I was just worried about death), tons of nervous energy
  
  some reason I doubt it's mania are: my sleep schedule and appetite are not affected at all, there are no lows or swings
  
  so as you can see I'm conflicted. I don't mind the experience but the thought disorder is difficult to deal with like I have to make lists to communicate out loud right now because I can't focus on words right.

  ","
  there is a practical reason for me- I wear overalls a lot. Like I think I have 5 pairs. I don't own any fully long sleeved shirts to go under the overalls, so it's always a tee or a tank. So I'm left with two choices- wear a sweater over the overalls, and then have to take that sweater off every time I need to use the bathroom, or wear arm warmers and have ease of use.

  when i was 19 a local gallery offered me a one-woman show, which is a HUGE deal and was a very rare honor for someone at that age. Unfortunately, I was in the middle of a complete and total schizophrenic meltdown that was getting ready to ruin my entire life. I got so nervous about the show that I just like- moved away and didn't tell the gallery. It wasn't the reason I moved, I had to to get help, but I was just so completely overwhelmed I couldn't even DEAL with things.

  my favorites lately tend to be action movies. I love for instance star wars, mad max, and fast and furious movies. I also like ""art house"" type movies, the sort of thing I would have seen in film class. I like a good horror but I'm particular about it. I get tired of the mental illness tropes in this particular genre.

   Describe your favorite room in your house. Why is it your favorite? What would you change about it?
  ","
  well, I guess the great room but technically I have a favorite PART of the great room, which is a little dining nook and where I've built my office. It's my favorite because this is where I work and hang out, I have two desks and a buffet-style shelving unit that I use as a third desk and storage, one desk has my computer and two monitors, the other desk has my paint and easels, the storage shelves hold my knitting yarn and other art supplies. The cats like to hang out here and there's a heating vent right next to my chair so it's always cozy.
  
  There's a nook in this area that I used to have Bubo's bird cage in, and since it was a quite large cage the space is pretty empty now. For my birthday my husband said I could buy a new armchair and lamp to put there, to make a little reading nook in Bubo's honor. I'm working on a painting to place over the chair now. This will soon be my favorite part of the house

  ","
  as a kid, I like music from the 50s and 60s. as a teen I listened to boomer rock, punk, and 90s alt. In college, I listened to pretty much all of that, plus emo. As an adult, I mainly listen to indietronica/electro pop, with some 90s alt thrown in for nostalgia.

  I rescued a hamster years back and my oldest cat ended up really loving that baby. I'd put him in his plastic ball and let him run around while I was doing stuff in the living room and he'd immediately look for Rin and they'd hang out together (He was safe in his big ball) I'd often find Rin laying on her side asleep with her little buddy snuggled up next to her in his ball

  Proud Boys are very prominent here, and on nextdoor . com  people will go so far out of their way to defend them and act like they are protecting the community, which is obviously false they've shot at protestors and are terrorizing the community with guns and militant behavior

  so we had chores as a kid, but the goal in assigning them wasn't to teach us life skills, but rather to do the things my mom didn't enjoy doing herself. She didn't mind doing laundry, so I was NEVER shown how to do laundry growing up. I was an expert at cleaning a bathroom, though.

  I'm a white woman. I'm not ""woke"" I never have a single time claimed to be ""woke"" I don't even use the term ""woke""- AND IF YOU ARE WHITE, which you likely are because literally who else would be this creepy and ridiculous- you need to get it out of your vocab, too.

I'm not teaching anyone anything. I'm not in the public eye, I am not a politician. I'm a Gen X white woman who isn't a piece of garbage fire- like you.
