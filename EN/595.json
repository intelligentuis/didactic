They found a device they said \"was out of this world\" that somehow makes the pyramid contact the sky. Then there was a device that made the prism into a sphere for the same reason (idk the scientific reason) there was messages all over the walls, like as if theyve come back to the pyramids.. one message was saying soon the star gods will return. Other messages were harder to read, but the pieces they gathered were their plans. The being in the tomb wasnt a human. And under the tomb was a hidden room called \"the tomb of knowledge\" the scientist got so freaked out they closed up everything sealed it all and said no one should be allowed in there ever.
