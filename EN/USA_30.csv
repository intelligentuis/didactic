   That's great. See I actually have BPD and I haven't been diagnosed with ASPD. I've just been told that I had a lot of ASPD tendencies years ago but at that time my fp(BPD term) did infact have ASPD so I think I was mimicking her and lost my own personality for a while.

  I'm familiar,  my mother, ex partner, and several friends have BPD. I tend to have an ""fp"" too sometimes because of learned behavior. The only personality disorder that's been considered for me though wasd avoidant, but I didn't meet all the criteria (I have a way strong sense of self mainly)

  yeah it's really awful.It's kinda why I tell everyone who'll listen basically that I have schizophrenia to break up stigma and face any questions head on to clear it up.
  "
161019,"
   Need to clear something about my ASPD q. I used ""sociopath""&""psychopath"" bc those are what Shane uses in the documentary. I also thought most wouldn't know much about ASPD and I wouldn't get as interesting answers w/o those words. Psychiatrists have questioned in the past whether I have ASPD or not.
  ","
  word I wasn't worried about it I know you're not an ableist.

  ","
  no never. I also sleep 12 hours a night on average though so I definitely don't need naps.

161053,"
   Why did you sleep in science classes Allison?
  ","
  because the teachers were less strict and I needed sleep badly. I could get away with sleeping in sciences and government and history. I couldn't sleep through art classes because they were active. English teachers were always strict. I didn't have the luxury of being able to sleep through math because I needed to pay attention to everything in order to pass quizzes. Most things, I was able to quiz well enough at the end of the day that sleeping through the lectures didn't really matter.
  "

I've been thinking about old shit from my past that's better hidden away forever because of current events in my country and I keep having weird dreams that bother me all the next day. In GOOD news, I'm going to eat a cheeseburger for dinner while watching the new Bob's Burgers.

She has grooming that has to be preformed every couple of months (wings and toenails) and her cage gets dirty quick. Also she poops everywhere. But I love her and it's worth it.

  ha maybe like 30 min I don't know about all day
  "
161883,"
   What's ""in boarding""?
  ","
  when I travel I don't normally take her with me, travel is stressful for birds. So I take her to a store that specializes in parrots and they take good care of her while I'm gone. The word for that is to ""board"" so I'm putting her ""in boarding"" means she's going to the petsitter. She gets her room and board.
  "
161884,"
   Does Bubo try to communicate with other birds?
  ","
  sometimes if she hears one of the jays outside she'll yell back and she sings most when the windows are open and she can hear other birds. When she's in boarding she gets to chatter with other parrots all day.
  "
161885,"
   Would you hatch Bubos eggs if that was scientifically possible?
  ","
  I dunno, babies are a lot of work. If her eggs were fertilized and I was guaranteed that the store that I bought Bubo from would buy my babies and do the hand feeding then maybe. But probably not. Bubo and I share a special bond, she's my support animal, and that bond would be altered if she were taking care of a brood

I was accepted to mensa at age 18 after attending gifted schools throughout childhood, and I'm very open-minded and willing to learn, but I don't actively pursue it.

  In the past month's time, I've started also using Neutrogena anti-aging creams (tone moisturizer and wrinkle eye cream) daily and a refrigerated jade roller (as pictured) on my face after applying these creams in the morning when I drink my coffee. I feel like they've made a little bit of a difference, I get carded like everytime I buy alcohol and I definitely did not used to be.

   What's the biggest difference between being cocky, having confidence and just being blunt/straight to the point to you? Is there much of a difference? Which one do you fit more, if any?
  ","
  a cocky person has a sort of 'better than you"" attitude and that confidence may be false. A blunt person may not have confidence at all but values logic or brevity. Having confidence just means being comfortable with yourself I guess like it can be expressed or it can be hidden. Of the three I am a confident person and sometimes I value brevity and can be blunt but I don't like to be cocky ever.

In addition, she gets a leafy green everyday (parsley, spinach, and cabbage are her favorites) and a variety of proteins like nuts, egg whites, chicken, or beans. She loves corn, she loves popcorn, she loves blueberry pancakes, she loves wheat bread. Sometimes she gets broccoli when we have it, or asparagus tips. She got a sweet potato fry the other day which was yummy. Brussel Sprouts are a favorite. She'll eat about anything right now while she's sitting on eggs but sometimes she's pretty picky.

   have you ever thought what would happen if you were obligated to work? trigger warning, but i wouldnt work i would just self destruct either externally (hurting others) or internally (hurting myself) sorry dont answer if this is too triggery/sensitive, its just something i always wonder.
  ","
  I have decided to just try again and get a job here and there throughout my adult life and what generally happens is I'm fine and settle into a routine and then something happens or I have bad symptoms and can't work as efficiently or as well as I'd like and I sort of spiral out until I can't even bring myself to get out of bed and it causes panic and I end up in a hospital lol. I could maybe work if I had a job where I didn't have to deal with the public as much and could just stick to a very ""busy work"" oriented routine but I would need an extremely understanding and flexible boss.

   what symptoms do you have with your mental illness?
  ","
  I'm schizophrenic, which causes positive symptoms like delusions and hallucinations, negative symptoms like depression, apathy, and emotional flatness, and cognitive symptoms like word salad, poor executive function, and memory loss. I also have panic disorder, which causes debilitating panic attacks multiple times a day when I don't have access to beta blockers, medical weed, and my emotional service animal.

162611,"
   say you meet random new people, what do you say if they ask what you do or what your job is? i always dread being asked that question so i make up some excuse but i am on disability due to mental illness
  ","
  I just say I'm disabled because of mental illness. I have found that hemming and hawing about it just makes people suspicious that you're hiding something and also I get a small joy out of making them think abruptly about what an ableist question that can be to people you don't really know. If they have questions, I answer them. I recently had a housecleaner who asked similar questions and while she was a little shocked at my response she took the opportunity to learn about mental illness instead of just being weird. I see more of that nowadays.

  I have panic disorder, though I don't talk about it much because with Bubo and beta blockers it's mostly treated. I have frequent panic attacks in a ""normal"" state, to the point of it shutting down my heart and giving me actual heart attacks. Like, multiple panic attacks a day. It's really extreme and debilitating. With meds, I have much less, like a couple a week. With therapy and Bubo, I have zero, ever. She keeps me calm because you have to sort of force your body into a relaxed state to befriend and handle a bird. They're very skittish. I can't seem to manage to relax for my own sake but for her sake, I have no issue doing so. So, being with her literally keeps me relaxed and calm. I have only had 3 panic attacks since Bubo came home with me 2 years ago and like I said, my health was in danger prior.

  because I'm sort of a pink-undertone, it blends right in to my skin and just looks like... a glow. A colorless, natural glow lol. Just the way color theory works or whatever, as green and red are complementary colors. Fenty has an AMAZING mint right now in the Summer line but it's not vegan (it comes with a bronzer that contains carmine) and Essence has a $5 dupe that is more or less the same color it just takes more layers to build up. I wear it with anything really. I LOVE highlighter. it's my jam. I have like, so many colors I wear regularly in layers or solo here's a pic of the ones I wear most frequently

   Yes. Polygamy is usually a forced religious thing where in most cases a man is married to multiple women at the same time but those women can only see that one man.

  my sister and her have a relationship but they've always gotten on better. My sister is like my mom's mini-me looks-wise and in many ways personality-wise so she's easy to get along with I suspect. My sister gets angry and cuts her off for small amounts of time but always changes her mind because they usually can sort things out and because of the grandkids. I was the oldest and I look like the man she hates and our personalities clash and I am mentally ill and she treats that as something gross I'm supposed to control better within myself or something and I dunno. My earliest childhood memories are of being neglected or being treated like a party favor to entertain her disgusting disco friends. My sister didn't get to experience that stage of my childhood.

   Have you noticed a difference while on metformin?
  ","
  YES but I am taking it for a really niche reason. My testosterone levels are abnormally high and metformin has the side effect of lowering testosterone so it keeps me level. I lost about 20 lbs on it also so there's that. I know that's what most people start metformin for. The biggest problem for me has been trying to convince hospital staff I'm not diabetic during emergencies they've pricked my finger about a million unwarranted times because they think if I'm on metformin I must be diabetic which I'm not. I take it twice a day and my testosterone leveled out within the first two weeks and has stayed good since.

All I know is shit got real weird and to some extent, dangerous, and it started when the girls upstairs from me turned a ouija board face-down and then it went away when I had a witch cleanse the place.

   what happens when schizophrenics drink alcohol, or use street drugs. any examples?
  ","
  we're prone to addictive behavior. So that's a thing. I drink alcohol occasionally in ""phases"" but I've been successful in not becoming addicted to it. My biggest concern is with medication interactions. I can't drink tooo often or else that + my pills = high blood pressure.
  
  I have no experience with street drugs, only medical marijuana. There have been studies that show that schizophrenics who take LSD can have flashbacks later in life. I was dosed once against my will but I've never had trip flashbacks (just ptsd flashbacks). I would assume that we react like anyone else does but maybe with more intensity.

The main thing I want people to be more informed about is that we're more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. We're not dangerous members of society, we're fairly regular people when you get down to it.

  maybe so. I feel like the natural things are prob okay, like I was dosed with LSD once as a teen and it was definitely bad so I wouldn't try that again but I'm drawn to shrooms and peyote as bucket list things, not regular use things.

  Handy guide on whether or not to ask me your question:
  
  What's the purpose of your question? Is it to LEARN something, about me personally or my opinions or things I might know about, etc.? Then proceed! That's the correct reason to ask a question.
  
  Is the purpose instead to gain attention to yourself, create drama between other accounts, declare your views without prompting, or hurt someone's feelings, then just don't? Maybe stop and think about why you're like this?
  
  If the purpose is to get your gross little dick hard, then like, delete yourself. I will report you if I don't choose to shame you first. No one wants your fetish questions. No one wants to be badgered about underwear or pics or whatever else y'all love to send to people. Other folks are right to charge y'all money, this isn't sad little penis wants attention dot com.

  it's ableist. A lot of medical issues and medication side effects cause weight gain and make it hard-to-next-to-impossible to lose.

   What’s the hardest you’ve worked at something? (Made a new question topics thing:)
  ","
  I worked really hard at holding my shit together when I first started showing positive symptoms of schizophrenia. I thought I was just ""stressed out"" and I could like, take a long enough nap and feel better. It became too much though and everything sort of unraveled. There was a period of a few years where I was really all over the place and didn't have any realistic support for what I was experiencing but eventually I saw a psychiatrist and therapist combo and got sort of sorted out temporarily. Then I stopped taking my meds and got married and sort of just winged things until about 5 years ago.
  
  TL:DR: being functional is the hardest thing I've worked at

There's a little garden there with some sculpture and benches and vendors set up inside the door in the lobby and also all along the outside garden area. Vendors sell things like handmade jewelry, houseplants, wood carvings, fresh bread, chocolates, eggs, meat, whatever fruits and vegetables are seasonal, kettle corn, and fresh cut flowers. Other things here and there. Like soap or honey. Different vendors weekly. I love it I walk up there a few times through the Summer and buy myself a flower bouquet and some veggies for Bubo (and dinner)

  Internalized misogyny. They've been taught from infancy to ""other"" girls and treat them like something different and less than a human being.

   Awww lol she's like you're best friend. I've always wanted a bird. There easy animals to domesticate aren't they?
  ","
  I bought her from a parrot store that specializes in breeding small companion birds as well as working with the community rehoming older larger parrots. She was hand fed from the very beginning, before she was even ever moved to the nursery for me to see her. If you buy a bird that way, from a breeder who really knows parrots and has an avian vet and knows what goes into hand feeding, then you're going to get a very docile companion bird. If you go to petsmart and buy a parakeet, you're probably going to have to work very very hard to win it's trust. But, it's possible. I really do recommend not supporting petsmart and petco and the like for that sort of thing though, parrots are very complicated creatures and a specialized breeder is the way to go.
  "
164526,"
   She has siblings? Lol
  ","
  yup she was part of a 5-bird clutch I was the first to pick one out of them and I picked Bubo because she was the most active/had the brightest eyes because let's be real baby birds are kinda funny looking it's hard to guess what they'll grow up to look like lol I was just going for ""healthy""
  "
164527,"
   Would you get bubo another parrot?
  ","
  If it got to a point where I didn't need her company, or I was feeling so well for a stretch that I took a part time job, or something like that, then yes. For now though I selfishly need her to spend her time with me instead of another bird.
  
  TBH I don't know how she is with other birds. She nipped at her brother and sister's feet (and she nips at mine too, still lol) and she attacks a mirror most of the time (sometimes she's just a curious girl) She likes to mimic the sounds of other birds in boarding when I've taken vacations but no one there has ever told me one way or another if she interacts with them past that. I worry sometimes that if I did get her a friend, she would be mean to them.

  Yes, absolutely. You have to remain pretty calm to handle a bird, they're really anxious little things. Having Bubo on my shoulder means I'm holding back all outward signs of panic and being as relaxed as I can, which I have to do with panic disorder because while beta blockers help the heart related symptoms I have from panic attacks, I still can get very anxious. She's a good girl and does a good job.

   How long does you're artwork usually take you to complete ?
  ","
  my drawings and paintings look a lot different, but both are done in layers and each layer can take from 10 minutes to two hours depending on what I'm doing. Paintings have more layers so take longer. If I am itching to paint and I'm not caring if the layers of paint are dry then I can push out a painting in a day but  generally it takes a process of a couple of days. Drawings have about 4-7 layers and depending on how much I feel like pushing through them I can finish a drawing in a few hours.

  it's not proven that that's what happened but like, it's something that people have been giving it credit for anecdotally forever.

But then, those bitches started SHRINKING and I was like whattttt so now I'm pro weed for all ailments. it's helped my glaucoma/optical nerve pressure go down and stay regulated, it eradicated ptsd flashbacks, it made my boob tumors shrink, I sleep better, I have a healthier appetite, I feel more active and creative because it helps relieve some of my negative schizophrenia symptoms. When I can't smoke, like when I'm travelling to states where it's not legal, I take hemp/CBD oil which IS legal everywhere and it's just as helpful though maybe not with sleep and appetite because those are THC things.

   Can you be friends with teens at this age?
  ","
  by ""at this age"" I assume you mean my age? At age 38 I do not think I could be ""friends"" with a teen. I could be fond of a teen and acquainted with a teen but the relationship at it's best would still have a very large generational gap and a sort of mentoring/auntie sort of vibe going on. I don't have any teens in my life that aren't related to me. I would never seek out friendship with a teen. I don't think there's a person I consider a friend really under the age of 26 or so. That doesn't mean I hate teens I just don't have enough in common with someone at that age to really want to be friends with them. Also it's a little creepy for adults to befriend children they aren't related to unless it's a mentoring program or whatever.

They did extend my job for me for the duration of time I lived in that area, let me create my own position in the back (receiving assistant) so that was good. I ended up moving because of my husband's job though and then panic disorder sort of got way worse as other things became unwell and anyway I haven't worked much since and I'm limited in what I can do but they did pay for some things at least I guess.

Tumblr I don't really follow anyone too closely. In the past I posted more but now it's just where I dump instagram posts and redbubble ads.

   What do you think about sparkling water? Do you like it?
  ","
  I used to drink a lot of soda, like a 12 pack of cans or more a day. It was really affecting my teeth, causing cavities and staining and what not. So I switched to the store brand version of LaCroix sparkling water in various flavors, and then when that was the ""norm"" for a while and I only wanted soda like, once a day if that, I switched to just regular filtered ice water. I feel like without the transition sparkling I wouldn't have been able to go straight to drinking ice water.  PS my teeth are so much healthier now.

   (this question might not apply to everyone i follow but) in your country, what’s the name of the indigenous population who was native to the area? are they still around? what’s life like for them now?
  ","
  There are hundreds of different tribal names and groups but the pc term for all of the indigenous people as a group is ""native american"". They are for sure still around, some on reservations, and life is not great for them now. They get treated the same as other people with brown skin in this country, which is ""not that well"". Hopefully things will be better one day.

   Would you give up smoking?

  I already gave up smoking cigarettes like 8 years ago.
  
  I have some CBD oil I'm testing on a trip across country instead of smoking weed. There are two main components to what people smoke and those are THC and CBD. Each has a slew of medical benefits, but the only things I really depend on THC for are muscle relaxant, easing me through flashbacks, and because being high is fun. So I think that if I'm careful not to trigger ptsd and I just use my prescription muscle relaxers that I almost never use instead I'll be good with just the CBD (in this case it's been harvested from hemp which doesn't even contain THC at all so it's legal in America)
  
  CBD helps my inner ocular pressure (I have glaucoma), has reduced my breast tumors, is an antipsychotic, helps relieve anxiety, helps relieve pain, helps relieve my negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
  
  There's a lot of shit out there saying that you shouldn't smoke if you are schizophrenic but the truth is, it's very very good for schizophrenia. The concern initially was that exposing yourself to THC at a young age (teen years or earlier) might trigger psychotic episodes but there really hasn't been any evidence supporting that at all and in fact some studies have been done to show that any paranoia caused by THC can be sort of cancelled out by a good amount of CBD. So I hate seeing that information spread around, it's saved my life and helped me feel ""normal"" for the first time.
  
  So I might stop smoking it, to answer your question, one day, because concentrates seem like the future and I do want to take a break with just the oils for a week or so. But I'll probably never give up CBD because I feel like it's really turned my health completely around. THC I don't really want to give up but I may in spurts.

  Childhood trauma, divorce of parents at a young age, loss of a favorite grandparent right after, a mom who kinda ended up being extra narcissistic and flighty during her single years and caused deep fears and anxieties about losing her as well to the point of being unable to really trust that anyone actually loves me for me lol. Fun stuff. Anxiety disorders exacerbate it and CPTSD causes flashbacks to times when I've felt especially helpless or unloved. I've been through lots of therapy though so everything's like, ok.

   Is there a person your SO hang out with and you don't like, have you expressed your dislike to your SO?
  ","
  My husband's best friend around here is a conspiracy theorist type which weirds me out but like, I don't have to hang out with him. His other best friend rubs me the wrong way because his wife was bffs with my husband's ex before me and was actively rude to me when we first got together but like, I don't really have any reason to hate him other than that.  So I don't really say anything about either of them really neither are a big enough dislike that it bothers me that he hangs out with them.

It always lasts about 8 months and then I completely fall apart. Before diagnosis, back when I was only beginning to show signs of psychosis, I was juggling like 5 jobs at once I was a beast, and I worked hard and enjoyed it. I'm just unable to do that now.
  
  I say that but I've considered taking part time jobs locally recently since I've been sort of stable but I just don't really know what I'm able to healthily do and what would even hire me

Sit and drink coffee and fuck around on the internet with Bubo for like, 30 min. Put Bubo back and turn on lightbox for an hour. Continue fucking around on the computer  and drinking coffee. Eventually light therapy ends and I grab a glass of water, take my meds, and go outside to smoke up. From there the rest of the day is spent in between chores, smoking, playing with Bubo, and relaxing at my desk until like, 5pm when my husband gets home then we fix dinner and watch tv together and then I generally end out my night at my desk again, sometimes painting, sometimes whatever, until bedtime which is early because I take night meds at 7 pm and generally get very tired within an hour of that.

I'll probably try for a male next time just because Bubo lays eggs once a year and it's a month that I don't have her support/emotional services when she's laying on her eggs.

I was able to come visit her after 4 weeks old which I did several times so that she'd remember me. She still goes back there for grooming (wings, toenails) and for boarding when I'm unable to keep her overnight somewhere like for instance I drove across the country 2 years ago so she had to stay in boarding because it would have been cruel to have her in the car that long.

   As a black guy, personally I would say that my race has played an influence in my life in many ways. Do you think race also influences the way other people perceive you?
  ","
  sure. I'm less likely to be followed in a store, I'm more likely to have customer service people comply with me, people automatically trust me as a middle aged white lady. People smile at me when they pass. No one is afraid of me. My race has definitely influenced the way people see me.

   What's a law that you're passionate about having changed? If any?
  ","
  I'm really psyched about how CA is handling cannabis legalization, with the pardoning or revisiting cases of retroactive crimes committed over small amounts of ""drugs"" because the criminalization of weed has always led to more people of color being treated harshly for next to nothing and now they're trying to fix that. I want my state to do the same. We've been legal 5 years now, but nothing about those in prisons for small time pot offenses has been discussed yet that I know of.

   What influence do you think race has on a person ? Has you're race ever had influence on you're life in anyway?
  ","
  I can't speak from an international perspective but as far as here in America there is definitely a clear advantage to being white. People of color are treated worse in ways that effect like every part of living. When I was harassed by cops as an unruly teen, I never had to worry about being shot to death like a person of color does. I think about that a lot. I've been stopped by so many officers for so many small things and in a lot of cases I was drunk or psychotic and they definitely could have seen me as a risk and killed me but my whiteness saved me.

But Id follow you back for instance, and I follow a few others from here and most of my facebook friends who also have an account. A few twitter mutuals. Some art-related accounts that followed me first.

My back will never get better but I can be careful and do my best to keep it from getting worse. PCOS pain will improve once I go through menopause.

  ","
  I have an app on my phone that connects to a wrist band I wear digitally that has a good guided practice but often I choose to listen to bells or gongs from the same app and just focus inward. It has helped change the way I live my life, has kept me rooted in the present, and has helped me overcome panic (not that I have much more now that I'm on beta blockers twice daily). It's something the therapists in this area recommend highly for just about everyone.

  I told him when we first started dating and it wasn't really ever an issue until the boring negative symptoms became more prominent as I shifted into being labeled residual rather than paranoid schizo. Lack of motivation, social anxiety, agoraphobia, those things have been an issue in the past. Never the weird stuff though.

   Did you used to express your delusions to other people when they were happening and did you ever stop to truly consider their efficacy in reality?
  ","
  I am lucky enough that I mostly recognize things as delusion when it comes to hallucinations and voices at least.  The example I used with the black birds, for instance, I knew that they weren't really there for other people so it wouldn't be something I'd share. The delusions of persecution and stuff was way more believable so sometimes I would try to explain those things to people. For instance I thought my apartments in Mass were haunted and believed that for years and have told the ghost stories many times but now that I'm on antipsychotics I realize that it was more delusion than truth so I wish I hadn't of blabbed my mouth so much.

166129,"
   In what way did being delusional help you to take life by the horns?

  I had so many fears that normal things didn't phase me. It's like, priorities. When you think your landlady summoned a demon with the help of the Freemasons and it's targeting you, or like, think you're being followed by a flock of black birds that you can see and that it's an omen that something bad will happen to me, other things like social anxiety take a backseat.

   Ever killed an animal to eat it?

  No. I wouldn't be able to hunt I don't think. I don't like to think about where my meals come from. If it wasn't for the cost, convenience, and my medical restrictions, I would be vegan easily.

  I think a part of him enjoyed how wild I was :P I'm more afraid of that now than I was then. I (hopefully) have nothing to worry about though. I just worry sometimes that I'm pretty boring or hopeless or I dunno. At least when I was delusional I was really taking life by the horns.

  a little bit of both. sometimes I feel very tiny inside of my body though. And sometimes I feel like my mind has expanded out.

  probably existing not much differently than now. I hope that I""m still well managed mentally and able to do art.

166187,"
   Do you feel and notice that your body is ageing?

  when it comes to joint and muscle pain, yes. I definitely notice a difference between what my joints can handle now versus when I was younger. Otherwise not really. Like I have a white eyebrow hair that I keep plucking. the skin around my eyes is thinner.

   Is it legal to grow weed where you live?  If so, why don't you grow your own?
  ","
  it is legal for someone with a medical license to grow up to 8 plants. I have considered it, sure, but I when I looked into the amount of money it would cost to convert part of my garage into a grow and to properly raise it it just didn't seem worth the money or effort.

   Has legalization of weed made it more or less expensive to buy?

  I don't know, I've not bought it illegally. It goes as low as $7/g for flower though so that seems probably pretty competitive if I was guessing.
  "
166194,"
   Is there much stigma attached to weed consumption where you live?  Like are you judged by those who don't use weed?
  ","
  not really, it's been legal here recreationally for 4 or 5 years now and medically since 1998. The dispensaries are frequented by college kids and grandmas at about the same rate. There's always a wide variety of folks when I go from all walks of life.
  "
166195,"
   I thought that medical weed isn't supposed to get the person high.  Is that true?
  ","
  depends on the strain. They have strains that have virtually no THC, and are high CBD- they have concentrates that are only CBD, but in general most weed has some THC and a little bit of CBD. So most strains can get you high just not as much as something bred specifically for high THC

  ","
  depends on where it comes from. Generally if I buy it in OR it's labeled as medical, but if I buy it in WA it's labeled as recreational. Just because of how the dispensaries work.
  "
166199,"
   I also heard that smoking weed makes some people schizophrenic even after the effect wares off?
  ","
  that is an old wive's tale from when there were very few real studies on schizophrenia. In reality, it's a genetic disorder, like most things.

  standard edibles don't do shot for me because my tolerance is very high but I did buy some BHO concentrate in a syringe not long ago as a birthday gift to myself to dose my own coffee and that was pretty amazing. I see myself buying that again in the future.

   didn't anyone help you when your drink was spiked?  And how did you know it was LSD?
  ","
  eventually my friend found me but I sort of snuck away unnoticed it was a weird party. I don't officially know if it was LSD I just assume because of the type of people I knew at the edge of my groups who would be malicious enough to drug someone, and because the visual hallucinations and delusions with the solidified cigarette smoke. I ended up being schizophrenic so I don't know if that's just how other drugs affect us or if I hallucinate differently than others or what.
  "
166205,"
   Ever experimented with psychedelic drugs?
  ","
  someone dosed me with LSD when I was 17, in my drink. I had a very bad trip. It was at a party. I crawled away because I thought the smoke hanging in the air was solid and sort of went on a weird, crawling trip through someone's garden and ended up curled up asleep on the front porch.
  
  that's my only experience. I've never taken any drugs on purpose except cannabis which was recommended by my doctors.

   How did you discover that your cat loves strawberry yogurt? I've heard that (many? most?) cats actually can't digest dairy products well. Can your cat digest them okay?
  ","
  He only gets what's left in a cup after I've eaten all the yogurt out, so that little bit is fine for him. I've had to put pills for him in yogurt before so he would take them so at those times it was like, a teaspoon. He just started whining when I was eating yogurt one day so I let him lick the bowl and now if he hears the foil top come off of a yogurt cup, he comes running. He doesn't finish vanilla or any creamy flavors but he will get every last drop of most fruit flavors especially strawberry. Sometimes, he gets so into licking the cup that it gets stuck on his snout and I have to help him out.
