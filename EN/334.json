i share birthdays with a lot of people .","308976":"it would be a red flag if the person i was dating was rude to the staff of the establishment we were visiting i have no patience for people who don t respect retail and food service workers .","308977":"i agree ! ! however , i m probably biased because i think most animals are cute .","308978":"i ve only been on three interviews in my entire life , but i ve been offered jobs from all three of them , so i guess i wasn t terrible . which is ironic because job interviews give me panic attacks , but i guess the hiring managers would never think that about me based on my conduct lol .","308979":"listen to my favorite music with me buy me coffee offer to go to the bar for a drink and a chat give me an animal to play with validate me","308980":"i spent on coffee and breakfast this morning , and another on a second cup of coffee on my lunch break .","308981":"i did . i graduated college with a . gpa .","308982":"i disagree . you can like any music at any age just because i m not a teenager doesn t mean i can t still enjoy certain types of music .","308983":"i have so many emotions regarding his death . i ve been angry , frustrated , in shock , grieving , depressed , broken , lost , and confused . he was my idol growing up , and he taught me how to survive in the chaotic world i was living in . i owe my life to chester .","308984":"it depends on the day some days i get more bullshit than others . i usually delete racist propaganda , messages in other languages , and most messages that are statements instead of questions , as well as sexual questions .","308985":"i don t really think about my future wedding because that s so far in advance from now and i have more important goals right now than getting married . ideally , i would like for it to be small and low key , but i know it s going to have to be an elaborate party because of the size of my boyfriend s family .","308986":"self love is the ability to be comfortable and confident in yourself , embracing your flaws and attributes and understanding that your needs will sometimes come first before other people s needs . practicing self love and self care include doing things that make you happy , recharged , and relaxed when you need to be , whether it s through taking a bath or reading a book or taking a day off from work to give yourself a chance to breathe .","308987":"i ve never read any of her books , so no . i didn t even know who she was until this message .","308988":"i ve never felt an earthquake before , no . i have , however , experienced multiple hurricanes .","308989":"i smoke every day i m a smoker , after all .","308990":"tomorrow , i m going to work and then hopefully i m going to see my boyfriend after work . my weekdays aren t really too spectacular .","308991":"not generally , no . most people with mental illness function in society , so it s difficult to tell if someone struggles with mental illness based solely on appearance behavior alone .","308992":"that s an extremely harsh and misguided generalization there are dozens of reasons why people use public transportation , whether it s because they simply don t drive or because it s easier to use public transportation than to own a car .","308993":"no i always have to be doing something in order to occupy myself , otherwise i become withdrawn and depressed . even if the things i m doing are relaxing activities such as playing video games or watching a tv show , it s still something that takes my mind off of things and allows me to focus .","308994":"i always believed in quality over quantity . therefore , i think a short but fulfilling life would honestly be better because although you won t live as long , you made the most out of every day handed to you and created beautiful experiences and stories .","308995":"for work , i mainly write press releases and narratives for my company s clients , who are basically extremely accomplished individuals across the globe . i was also trained on writing newsletter features today , which is exciting because there s more creative freedom involved in those . aside from work , i write non fiction articles for medium . com occasionally , usually about mental health and my experiences . unfortunately , i haven t written anything since last july .","308996":"i actually really enjoyed science , and i was in all honors classes throughout high school i had taken ap biology , ap chemistry , and a forensics class through syracuse university . i liked forensics most of all because the subject matter was intriguing to me , especially learning about ballistics and blood splatter patterns . my teacher set up a crime scene as a final test and we had to determine what had happened , and we were graded based on our conclusions .","308997":"if you have a recommendation from a previous employer , it looks better to hiring managers because you re being endorsed as reliable by someone who has worked with you in the past . depending on your resume , recommendations can make you stand out among other applicants .","308998":"hey dumbass , don t forget to take your meds tonight before you go out so that you don t have a panic attack tomorrow","308999":"no , i think lightning is quite beautiful . i absolutely love thunderstorms .","309000":"there isn t anything that makes me feel free from everyday struggles , but keeping busy does help keep my mind at bay whether it s through writing , being preoccupied with a tv show , playing video games , or catching up with a close friend .","309001":"i don t own any gadgets , since i m not really into new technology . the only cool thing that i have which is sorta like a gadget is a nightlight that s an exact replica of the moon with three different light settings .","309002":"i do like papaya , and i also enjoy your enthusiasm regarding papayas ! !","309003":"i haven t heard the phrase impress your crush since middle high school , and i m cringing .","309004":"to the fullest extent addiction is a health care problem and to deny someone treatment because they re a drug addict is not only cruel , but it s morally wrong and goes against every code of ethics there is . drug addicts need medical treatment and support , not to be ostracized and ridiculed .","309005":"love is an intimate , emotional connection you share with someone on multiple levels . lust , on the other hand , is fueled by sexual desire based solely upon physical appearance .","309006":"yes and no if someone is young and watches pvrn , they might get wrong ideas about how sex actually works because they re inexperienced themselves . pvrn is grossly inaccurate when it comes to sexual conduct , which can mislead and misinform a lot of people if they don t know any better . i don t think pvrn has any effect on how people perceive love because sex and love are two vastly different things .","309007":"no , i m an athiest . i don t believe in any sort of higher power .","309008":"i love visiting museums , but i haven t actually been to a museum in a very long time . i used to visit new york city and go to various exhibits , such as the ones in the museum of modern art and museum of natural history .","309009":"i have seven tattoos so far i eventually want to cover my entire body in tattoos . my next pieces are going to cover my right forearm and the back of my right arm .","309010":"you don t need to be religious in order to have a decent standard of morals . you can view scenarios as good or bad based on how they ll affect other people , with no influence from religion whatsoever .","309011":"i don t necessarily feel comfortable with people touching me , but i do get my hair colored professionally and get my nails professionally done occasionally , simply because they re trained to be proficient in those areas and can do them better than i can .","309012":"because i don t feel the need to properly capitalize or spell my words on the internet . i like the look of lowercase words better .","309013":"yeah , he is . he was raised a christian , but he started doubting the existence of god when he was a teenager . he s an atheist these days .","309014":"my eyes , my ability to put on makeup , my writing and research skills , etc etc .","309015":"i don t remember the last time i actually used the word hell in a sentence unless you can show me . either way , it s a hyperbole . a cliche expression . everyone uses the term hell to refer to something bad , it isn t really a big deal .","309016":"not usually . sometimes i think of something witty , but it s rare .","309017":"no , it s still quite active at least my feed is active . it s certainly not as active as it was last year since a lot of regulars left , but i wouldn t consider it to be dead yet .","309018":"my region is fairly dangerous , so yeah , sometimes i do feel unsafe where i live . i carry a knife and whistle with me at all times , just in case someone were to try to jump me . i d like to change the drug epidemic that s sweeping my county . heroin is the most popular drug here , and lately it s been laced with fentanyl , so it s extremely lethal . i ve lost many people to heroin over the years .","309019":"i m not attacking you . i m merely stating that i don t have conversations with people on askfm , yourself included . for some reason , you can t take no for an answer .","309020":"i watch things which capture my interest immediately usually gritty action films , psychological thrillers , and suspenseful dramas .","309021":"it can be a mutual decision while also being a surprise knowing the exact moment when someone is going to propose takes away all of the fun and surprise of getting engaged . you can know that you want to marry a person without knowing when they ll propose to you .","309022":"i can t exactly predict that , haha . if i knew , then that would take away the surprise .","309023":"unfortunately , i didn t get to see him yesterday because he went into queens to visit his family . however , today we re just going to relax at my house my family has gifts for him .","309024":"skyrim , fallout , destiny and , the halo series , life is strange , the wolf among us , assassin s creed , the bioshock series , dragon age inquisition , and tomb raider .","309025":"long island is the area where i live it s an island that juts off of the state of new york .","309026":"my boyfriend s birthday was yesterday and he ended up ordering his own cake . i literally can t right now djfkdkajsjfkds .","309027":"for my job , i edit press releases , magazine features , and other text related to my company s brand . i also write press releases for clients as well that are distributed on various pr websites . the ceo of the company wants more writing to be done in house as opposed to remotely , so i ll be writing a lot more in the future ! !","309028":"well , yeah you re not a teenager anymore , so it s only logical to consider a year old to be in their s .","309029":"the only language i know is english , unfortunately . however , i ve always wanted to learn russian and latin .","309030":"through music if i can t find a way to express myself through writing , then i ll resort to music in an effort to show others how i feel or put my emotions into a melody to make me feel less lonely . i should clarify that i don t make music myself , but i do listen to music every day and stand by the notion that there is a song for virtually every mood or circumstance .","309031":"obviously ? lmao , the fuck kind of question is this .","309032":"sometimes , i do . however , it s usually only when i ve done my makeup and look somewhat presentable .","309033":"if you re going to keep carrying on like this , then i ll have no choice but to discontinue answering your statements . spirituality is not at all correlated with mental illness , because one is a matter of faith and the other is a matter of science . i m not in the mood to listen to this sort of talk because i get the impression that you don t respect my beliefs , and i m frankly tired of people discounting mental illness for what it truly is .","309034":"the way to treat mental illness is by taking medication and going to therapy , whether it s inpatient or outpatient procedures . to move on from my trauma , i have years of therapy to go through , because it s only through intensive cbt or dbt that i ll come to an understanding of my trauma , develop healthy coping mechanisms , and control my behavior . in addition , mental illness is mostly a chronic condition , and there are some mental illnesses that exist which afflict a person for their entire life . it can be treated and managed , but not eradicated completely . it s just the way psychology and physiology works , and it has no correlation with religion or spirituality .","309035":"good thing i m not a buddhist then . i m certain that my mental illnesses are a result of the years of abvse i endured , not because of some mindset that can t be substantiated by evidence .","309036":"i honestly have doubts about living the life i live now , so living another life after this one would honestly not be appealing to me .","309037":"i absolutely did . he had one of those personalities that attracted me on a romantic level , and all i wanted to do was get to know him better and talk to him all the time . you could tell there was mystery behind his eyes , and i wanted to know everything about him .","309038":"i think my life would be more difficult and lonely if i didn t have a phone , because it means i wouldn t have access to social media , which helps me substantially when it comes to my mental health . i also wouldn t be able to talk to my friends as often , which in turn would make me believe that they hate me .","309039":"abandonment .","309040":"you re under no obligation to talk to people you re no longer friends with , regardless of whether or not you have a mutual friend . that mutual friend of yours needs to understand that you don t have to be friends with their friends in order to be friends with them i hope that makes sense .","309041":"it could be construed as creepy because it insinuates that you re interested in having sex with her and you want to make sure she s of legal age .","309042":"i honestly don t remember quite a few months , as i had to accumulate more than , followers again in order to meet the criteria for verification .","309043":"people use social media as a place to vent and receive validation , so by posting things that her child is doing , she probably was releasing her frustrations as well as expecting other mothers to relate to her experience . having an ill mannered child isn t really something unusual or a big deal , especially at that age . people are allowed to complain .","309044":"bpd means borderline personality disorder .","309045":"i m a very paranoid person . i m usually suspicious of people s motives , i always think people are following me , i have to check rooms for doors and exits , and i m constantly aware of my environment .","309046":"yeah , i actually love swimming . i can t swim very well but i love the feeling of being underwater . it s so peaceful .","309047":"no , not really . i used to smoke a lot of weed in the past , but in recent years , it s only made me incredibly paranoid and i didn t like the way it made me feel . however , i m interested in trying one of those new pens that are out now instead of smoking a traditional joint or bowl . it seems to be a lot smoother with better quality .","309048":"this makes me laugh every time i see it","309049":"no . i ve never felt okay with the way i look . i also try not to look at my reflection in the mirror because it makes me uncomfortable and i don t want to upset myself .","309050":"nothing too out of the ordinary , so no . it was just an average day at work , and i ve just been relaxing ever since i got home . i guess you can consider it to be a good day since it s pay day and i got out of work an hour early .","309051":"a life free from anxiety . it would be nice to be able to leave my house and actually do things without getting overwhelmed with anxiety or harboring the fear of having a panic attack .","309052":"yeah , i d rather not discuss my flatulence or bowel movements on askfm .","309053":"when i m angry , i do i tend to talk a lot faster and my accent slips out more , haha . but generally speaking , i don t think i have much of an accent . it s difficult to tell when it comes to your own voice .","309054":"lol , no . i just happen to use it a lot because i have a caffeine addiction .","309055":"the past can determine the future in some cases , but only if you allow your past to dictate your life even though terrible things happen in people s pasts that undoubtedly change them , it s ultimately their decision as to whether or not they re going to try to move forward .","309056":"despair is more consolidating , in my opinion . people relate to each other more when they ve shared similar experiences in times of struggle or hardship , and often when tragedy occurs , people bind together to support one another . there s comfort in trying times because there will always be someone who will offer a helping hand . you re never alone , and that s a beautiful thing about humanity .","309057":"i m doing all right tired because i stayed out late last night , and i m probably going to take a nap when i get home . work has been well today , though . i ve been writing for the past two days , so that makes me happy .","309058":"if you re both comfortable with the concept and there s no sexual tension , then i don t see the problem . i ve seen some of my friends partially nude before .","309059":"haha , thanks ! ! yeah , i get a lot of hate here for whatever reason . it doesn t bother me though , no one knows my life except for me .","309060":"god forbid i have a few drinks with my boyfriend and a few friends lol .","309061":"no , i m at the bar with my boyfriend and a few friends .","309062":"no . i m non binary .","309063":"i don t have any haters in real life , haha .","309064":"i can certainly sing , but that doesn t mean i m good at singing . i m actually quite terrible .","309065":"no , i m not engaged .","309066":"my boyfriend and i might be going on a double date to manhattan on sunday to go ice skating ! ! i m ! ! so ! ! excited ! !","309067":"a few years ago , perhaps sooner than that . i only really started identifying as non binary two years ago , even though i always knew that i never identified as a woman . the first time i told my best friend that i was trans , she was shocked and said , you didn t know ? ! i ve known this since high school !","309068":"this damn animal , she s the cutest","309069":"this isn t a question , but hello regardless .","309070":"considering i have dissociative amnesia and can t remember years of my life , it would be beneficial to me to have memories of my past . it s something i ve always sought after , and i m considering going to a regression hypnotherapist soon .","309071":"sometimes it s hard to see at first because it may seem like the wrong choice , especially if someone gets hurt in the process but generally speaking , if the decision you made will ultimately improve your life or someone else s life in the long run , then it s the right choice .","309072":"no you need to to put in a lot of hard work to make a relationship last as well . if you love someone but don t put in the effort to show it or communicate your feelings with your partner , then your relationship might fail .","309073":"that s a bit concerning if i look years old , but thank you nonetheless .","309074":"i look up to a lot of people on askfm , for their dedication , bravery , and intelligence . some have left askfm , but there are also others who still answer questions here .","309075":"i d pay off all of my loans and buy a house for my boyfriend and i to live in . i d also buy my boyfriend a new car .","309076":"obviously . consent is required for every form of activity , sexual or otherwise . sex just be consensual , otherwise it s assault or rvpe , regardless of whether or not someone is in a relationship .","309077":"i don t really know how to cook , so no . i can make simple meals , but nothing extravagent .","309078":"i used to be , but i haven t felt ambition in a long time . when i m given no other option , then i can push myself to my full potential and make enormous strides . however , most of the time i m content with where i am because i have too many other conflicts going on .","309079":"yeah , there is . i really appreciate my job because there are a lot of opportunities for growth , managers are protective of their employees rights , and they re incredibly understanding of health issues .","309080":"i honestly don t know . i ve never really thought about naming a future child , so there aren t any names that i prefer .","309081":"yeah , sometimes . i mostly use his nickname , though .","309082":"not at all . my dad and i get along well , even though our relationship is distant . my mother is the one who has caused most of my problems in my life , and she s just a difficult person to live with in general .","309083":"not really , no . i usually just deal with things as they come up , otherwise i ll be too preoccupied with the what ifs of things falling apart .","309084":"tapestries and string lights on the walls big bay windows that shine natural light into the room a reading nook with shelves for books a king sized bed with a cozy , plush comforter and silky sheets enough room for a fish tank and a big screen tv hooked up to my xbox and paintings on the walls .","309085":"i assume that my parents trust me when it comes to most things however , the topic never comes up , so i can t be sure . i don t trust my mother , though . she s abvsed and gaslighted me for my entire life , so i never believe anything she says anymore .","309086":"venting to someone who s willing to listen is extremely helpful when it comes to dealing with personal issues , as long as the person you re venting to is responsive to what you have to say and is willing to support you . it s one of the only methods of treatment for my mental illness , which is why i advocate so strongly for psychotherapy . being listened to and validated is important .","309087":"my boyfriend . he s my greatest support system and idk what i would do without him .","309088":"pretty much , depending on the circumstance . as much as i preach about honesty and communication , i m usually the person who fakes being fine in work and social settings , otherwise i ll just fall apart .","309089":"no , it s not just you . that is rather aggravating , especially if you poured your heart out to them and they don t seem as if they even acknowledged your feelings .","309090":"i never indicated that i was ever having top surgery .","309091":"no i keep my relationships with my mentors bosses strictly professional , as i find no reason to become emotionally involved with them . to become emotionally invested with a figure of authority in a work setting would only put my job at risk .","309092":"people with psychotic disorders and antisocial personality disorder are just as deserving of compassion and treatment as those with other mental illnesses . there s no benefit to screening for such illnesses not to mention it would be impossible anyway , and to suggest so is discriminatory toward people with those illnesses .","309093":"if i didn t enjoy smoking , then i simply wouldn t smoke .","309094":"yeah , that would be incredibly rude if you used their financial status against them like that . how much money a person does or doesn t have doesn t dictate whether they re right or wrong in a situation . it s inconsiderate of you to behave in this manner .","309095":"i like menthol cigarettes , and these ones taste like peppermint sticks to me .","309096":"i m in dark mental places occasionally , but it isn t as bad as how it used to be when i was years old .","309097":"i don t really walk around that often , so no . i mostly smoke in my car , on my breaks at work , and in my own backyard .","309098":"i d much rather have an informal , whimsical gathering of close friends and family . weddings are too expensive these days and place the couple in too much debt , and i would like to avoid that if possible . my boyfriend and i don t need a huge , fancy wedding to prove our love for one another . i much prefer the look of small , quaint , outdoor weddings anyway .","309099":"i love mangoes , actually . they re among some of my favorite fruit ! ! my boyfriend s bearded dragon and i were sharing some mango slices the other day , haha .","309100":"i m tired and emotional idk why i m tired , but i m feeling emotional because i was thinking of the relationship i have with my boyfriend s family , and i feel so grateful to have his family support us as much as they do . i get along so well with his father and step sisters and step mother , and they basically consider me part of the family already . it makes me tear up .","309101":"this is my most recent tattoo and among the ones which have the most meaning it s the symbol for the band linkin park . they ve been an integral part of my life and it was the least i could do to memorialize chester bennington .","309102":"which tattoo ? i have seven of them .","309103":"i live with my parents , so there s three of us total .","309104":"i wouldn t give out compliments if i didn t mean them i think it would honestly be cruel if you complimented a person and didn t actually mean it just to make them feel better . most of the time , people can tell when a compliment isn t sincere .","309105":"i m not sure . this is one of those questions that i ll always contemplate but never know the answer .","309106":"ahh , thank you ! ! that means so much to me .","309107":"considering i said i was addicted to cigarettes , yeah i smoke .","309108":"in the past , i wrote a lot of poetry and short fictional stories that were loosely based on my life . my most recent works have been articles that were nonfiction in nature , depicting my struggles with mental illness and my past . i have them up on medium . com . i ve been wanting to write another article since it s been months since i ve written creatively , but i have no idea what to write .","309109":"not necessarily it s common nature for most children to act out in public , regardless of the way they ve been raised . you can t expect a child to behave like a little angel all of the time , especially considering how much stimuli exists in most public places . what can indicate toward bad parenting is the way the parent reacts to their child acting out .","309110":"i have the tendency to be , but i ve learned to control my anger over the years because i ve realized that i can be destructive when i m angry and i don t want to be that person anymore .","309111":"i ve come across a few publications that do the same thing , and one of my online friends actually is an editor for one magazine that does exactly that ! ! it s something i definitely want to look into more once i start writing more often . i need to get my name out there and make something of myself .","309112":"my family , tbh . i m nice to them to keep the peace and to prevent arguments from breaking out , because it s a lot easier to lie and be nice to certain people than it is to say how you truly feel , unfortunately . it isn t something i would really recommend to other people , but it makes life easier for my own sake .","309113":"lmao , the fuck ? of course not that s not how it works . my father is still home every day to help out , and i can t put my life on hold because of my mother . she s the reason behind my mental illnesses , so the best thing for my own health would be to move out and move on with my life , instead of being stuck in the same abvsive environment for the rest of my years .","309114":"i carry a weapon with me at all times .","309115":"a support system . it s difficult to get through life if you don t have a person or a few people upon whom you can rely and who might offer love and compassion when you need it most .","309116":"i double and triple check every door in the house to make sure they re locked within minutes of each other , and i always lock the doors the second i enter the house , regardless of who s home and what time of day it is .","309117":"i believe that people s purposes become clear to them eventually throughout their life . some people figure out their purpose early on , while for others , it may not become clear until much later in life .","309118":"somewhat i know that i want to be an advocate for mental health awareness and that i want to help people through my writing , but i haven t been able to really fuse the two together yet . i m sure it ll come in due time , whether an idea comes to me or an opportunity presents itself to me .","309119":"hell no i take selfies on the rare occasion when i feel good about myself , or there s something or someone else in the picture that makes up for how shitty i look that day . here s a photo i just took while i was taking care of quinn she likes mangoes btw","309120":"lol , this was a convo between myself and my boyfriend a few weeks ago . i have a really unhealthy obsession with baja blast","309121":"no ? even if i did , that s not something i advertise to other people , especially on askfm . my sex life is private to me .","309122":"i m doing well my boyfriend and i ended up sleeping for hours straight after we finished dinner last night , and we spent the morning talking and listening to music and making breakfast and drinking coffee . we re about to go out and run some errands , actually . it feels nice to finally have a day off together .","309123":"this is my boyfriend s beardie her name is quinn .","309124":"i don t have one favorite song in particular , but lately i ve been listening to linkin park nonstop . my favorite songs from them at the moment are sharp edges and talking to myself .","309125":"i m always honest in my responses , so every weekend is essentially honesty weekend .","309126":"oh , then in that case , i think they re fun . as long as they re obviously not discriminatory , i see no harm in them .","309127":"i shut down at first because my emotions overwhelm me and i feel frozen in place . i need time to calm down and collect my thoughts , and at that point , i can talk to the person about whatever issue we have .","309128":"i have extreme and unstable mood swings one hour i can be content , the next hour i can be angry with no reason , and the next hour i can be depressed . there isn t really any in between with me , but my mood swings have gotten better with medication .","309129":"i had no idea trump used askfm .","309130":"yeah i used to be on formspring . me . before i migrated to askfm , and i m also active on curiouscat .","309131":"nobody ever uses pick up lines on me because i intimidate a lot of people in real life and deter people from talking to me .","309132":"nothing has been inspiring me lately . i used to be inspired by nature , my relationship , things i encountered every day , etc etc . however , nothing has really popped out at me in a really long time , and its quite discouraging .","309133":"fun fact my high school made national news because someone filmed a brutal fight between two students on school grounds and it went viral . fun fact we had at least two bomb threats per year which required us to take a bus to the local park while bomb sniffing dogs and police crew swept the entire school grounds .","309134":"i want to continue going to therapy on a weekly basis and continue seeing my psychiatrist every month . it s helped me a lot to talk to people who have a deeper knowledge of mental health and want to actually make my life better . i also want to be more open about my feelings with my boyfriend . instead of pushing him away and isolating myself when i feel terrible , i want to reach out more and not be afraid that i m burdening him with my problems .","309135":"he s my best friend as well as my boyfriend . we can sit down and talk for hours straight without getting bored , we can share songs well into the night , and he understands me better than i know myself . he s always been there to support me regardless of how i was acting , he s sought to understand my illnesses where most people would push me away , and he s always respected me . i love him because he makes me a better person than who i was before and gives me a reason to continue living .","309136":"this is a complicated question . i m alive , and that s all that really matters .","309137":"i ve learned ap style of writing and editing , as well as learning how to pace myself and to work on assignments in an efficient but timely manner .","309138":"my forensics teacher during high school was great he had come from a poor background but used his experiences to motivate him to become educated and use his knowledge to help students . he was really open about his past , was trustworthy , and taught me a lot . his class was also very interesting and entertaining .","309139":"no , not yet . we re hoping to move in together later this year .","309140":"i feel as if this is some sort of transphobic riddle that i want nothing to do with .","309141":"supported me during my bad days when my mental illnesses act up respected my decisions , my career choices , and my inclination to be alone surprised me with my favorite things when i least expected it defended me when people have verbally attacked me or attempted to make me uncomfortable introduced me to his friends and wasn t afraid to show his love and affection regardless of where we are","309142":"my current job isn t my dream job , but it s within my field of expertise , which is great . i can only hope to continue living forward in this path . i d ideally also like to branch out into fiction writing , but that also requires me to write creatively when i m not in the office , which i haven t had the mental energy to do in quite a while .","309143":"if you re having sex and you re experiencing pain , then you re doing it wrong .","309144":"i think it would be a good step forward for women s equality . however , i would like a president that s actually educated in politics and international affairs as opposed to someone who s a woman with no experience whatsoever .","309145":"good old days by macklemore featuring kesha . sharp edges by linkin park .","309146":"i like the taste of bacon , but admittedly i ve been feeling guilty about eating it . i want to transition to a vegetarian lifestyle eventually .","309147":"fresh balsam , gasoline , cigarette smoke , freshly brewed coffee , the icy smell of winter in the air , jasmine , and rose .","309148":"no worries , anon , i have no interest in politics .","309149":"i dislike my real name , which is why i only go by my nickname s .","309150":"i m not really a part of any fandoms , but i ve always liked the idea that hermione from the harry potter movies was black .","309151":"i won t be old enough to run for president in , lol . but i appreciate the thought","309152":"i m presently in a relationship and have no intentions of dating anyone else .","309153":"my schedule doesn t change depending on the season , unfortunately . i still have work , doctor appointments , therapy , etc etc . i ve always wanted to go apple or pumpkin picking , but i usually get turned off from it because traffic is normally ridiculous and i don t want to walk around a pumpkin patch with other people .","309154":"i would probably be shocked , angry , and concerned for his well being because it would be out of character for him . feelings don t suddenly change overnight so i would assume that something happened to make him react so irrationally , and i would be there for him .","309155":"no . i m uncomfortable with physical touch , and the only people i allow to hug me are my boyfriend and best friend .","309156":"i wonder if these people realize that most porn on the internet is free .","309157":"since when has my page been a dumping ground for assholes and idiots ?","309158":"i m advising you that it s inappropriate to ask anyone about any aspect of their sex lives . it s not about how , it s about steering clear of the topic entirely .","309159":"this isn t an appropriate question to ask a stranger . i would suggest that you refrain from asking strangers online about their sex lives .","309160":"you re not going to get anywhere in life if you keep giving into your shy behavior . if you want something , you have to go and pursue it . if you like a girl and want to ask her out on a date , then you re going to have to step outside of your comfort zone and just ask her .","309161":". . . why am i getting messages that make literally no sense .","309162":". . . leigh . it literally says it at the top of my page and at the beginning of every answer .","309163":"everyone needs a sense of identity a sense of who you are as an individual , your opinions and morals , your attributes and flaws , your personality which makes you unique . most people inherently have a sense of self , it isn t something most people think about .","309164":"sometimes , sure . i often ruminate on the things i ve said and done in the past and wish i could have approached situations differently .","309165":"i m really down today for some reason . i guess my therapy session last night got me thinking about my past , and it made me feel bitter and resentful about what has happened over the years . i was literally a child . i didn t deserve the things that happened to me , and even if i was an unruly child , that doesn t justify the abvse i endured for over years . i can t get back what was taken from me and what i went through carries through to my adult life and negatively affects every aspect of my life . i know a part of recovery is acceptance , but how can i accept that this shit happened to me when it s contributed to my fucked up behavior and relationships and impulsive and self destructive habits and my desire to end my life all the time ? how can i accept that ? it s made me so angry and depressed and anxiety ridden and i can t control it anymore .","309166":"of course not . people shouldn t treat others as lesser humans to begin with regardless of their iq , it s just common courtesy .","309167":"most of the time , no . however , it depends entirely on the question because sometimes they re silly while other times they have deep meaning behind them .","309168":"i was born and raised in new york .","309169":"i think your rationale is false nobody needs anyone in their life , and relationships shouldn t be based on needing that person . you enter relationships because that person makes you a better version of yourself and motivates you to do better , and necessity isn t a factor . if someone claims that they need you in that sense , then it s usually a red flag .","309170":"i really have no interest in entertaining asinine notions like this .","309171":"there s no correlation between having free will and being on life saving medication . i have free will regardless of whether or not i choose to take medication for my mental illnesses . if anything , my medication gives me more freedom to do what i want need to do .","309172":"i never liked this photo , so i never posted it anywhere that i can remember .","309173":"yes , i m on a steady cocktail of psychiatric medication that i take every day .","309174":"no i don t give out my facebook to people i m not friends with , especially anons .","309175":"i m all right tbh , i m a bit down even though i had a therapy appointment today , but i suppose i m down because my appointment brought back some memories that i had suppressed , and i m thinking about my past a lot . i m trying to distract myself by watching some tv , but i honestly think i m just going to end up going to bed after the episode ends .","309176":"pm .","309177":"i wouldn t be able to choose just one because different environments would call for different filters to bring out the natural beauty of that environment . there isn t one single filter that works for every scenario .","309178":"cigarettes , coffee tea , alcohol , my relationship , and my friendship with my best friend . in a way , these things have ended up defining me , and i cling onto them because they provide me with a sense of purpose and a sense of identity .","309179":"no , it s basically been a standard work day . i had a lot of work to do because a special project prevented me from working on my usual assignments , so i have a lot of catching up to do this week . i m also leaving for my therapy appointment in a few minutes , which is good because i haven t seen my therapist in a while ever since i lost my insurance .","309180":"i m an editor writer for a publishing company . he s a manager at petco , and he also picks up a lot of side work doing construction , hvac , plumbing , etc .","309181":"i don t understand why people send messages like these not only are they obviously disgusting and inappropriate , but they re also incredibly unrealistic and are merely vague hypotheticals . stop anonymously messaging random people that you want to have sex with them and focus on improving your own life instead . i guarantee you there will be better outcomes .","309182":"i prefer solitary activities , such as writing , reading , art , playing video games , and photography .","309183":"people are allowed to have different opinions as long as they re not discriminatory to a group of people . the idea of calling someone a snowflake is juvenile in my opinion , because people often use the term to describe others whose opinions are simply different than theirs . however , there are also a lot of people who find offense in literally anything , so sometimes i can understand why people who use that term so openly feel the need to use it .","309184":"i often question this myself , lol . i think askfm is inherently addictive , and i ve never been able to deactivate permanently over the course of the years i ve been active here . i like the questions i receive and i like keeping up on my friends answers , so that s a major component as to why i haven t left askfm .","309185":"i honestly think it s silly toys shouldn t be gender specific , and there s nothing wrong with a boy playing with dolls or a girl playing with hot wheels . it doesn t determine which gender they are and develop into as they get older , and i think it s a trivial thing for parents to argue about .","309186":"i think it s an archaic way of thinking and everyone s idea of success is different and very subjective . in today s society , it s much more difficult for people to get a college education , if they want to pursue college to begin with , and there s more pressure on young adults to get married and have children .","309187":"it makes me wonder how badly a person has to feel about themselves in order to justify releasing that anger onto a complete stranger by criticizing something as minor as their appearance .","309188":"my writing i ve always wanted to be well known for my writing in such a way that my name would be known , but i wouldn t be recognized on the street . writing has always been my passion and it s a lifelong goal of mine to be published .","309189":"i ve only ever known one person who copied everything i did , from phrases to hobbies to style of dress to the friends i had , and it did annoy me a little bit . however , this was back in high school when petty things like that mattered because no one had a sense of identity .","309190":"i d rather not think about that because i would probably attempt svicide or voluntarily commit myself to a psychiatric hospital .","309191":"my boyfriend he s the only one that comes to mind when it comes to security . he s my strongest support system and the only person i feel genuinely safe around .","309192":"i have , it was actually a lot of fun . i went with a few friends and my boyfriend when we went away on vacation a few years ago .","309193":"i wouldn t have a job anymore if phones , computers , or the internet didn t exist .","309194":"i like earth tones maroon , navy blue , forest green , deep purple , and black .","309195":"no , i don t like sports . the only sport i ve ever been somewhat into was ice hockey , and that was because my boyfriend has been a team captain and coach .","309196":"i tried out my brother s vr headset once , but all it did was make me incredibly dizzy .","309197":"the purpose of askfm is for asking questions , not to have conversations . unless you have a question for me , you can kindly leave .","309198":"no , i think that the use of social media and the internet spreads greater awareness and understanding of cultures other than our own . social media and the internet makes it easier for people to share cultural practices and teach others about the world that exists other than their own .","309199":"i usually always read people s bios on askfm , and most other websites , because it gives a basic overview of who a person is . i like knowing people s names and especially their pronouns , if i have intentions of speaking to them .","309200":"yeah , definitely especially if they don t say excuse me before they take the call . i can understand if someone was waiting on an important phone call , but it s courteous to let the other person know beforehand that they might be on the phone at some point .","309201":"no . the only things i collect are mugs , and even so , my collection was accidental in nature . i just have this compulsion to buy mugs wherever i go , and now my cabinets are overflowing .","309202":"i m honestly not sure , if you want my honest opinion sexuality doesn t need to have a reason , it just simply is . it s the same concept behind why some people find cis men attractive but not cis women . it s not a conscious choice .","309203":"i like answering questions about myself which sounds selfish but whatever , and i also like getting to know people through askfm and making friends . i ve made a lot of good friends from askfm over the years to whom i can relate , and i genuinely care about them .","309204":"thankfully , my boyfriend s father and the rest of his family love me . they ve offered to allow me to move in if things at my house become too chaotic , and his grandmother also offered her home as well . they have their own sets of issues and drama , like any family does , but they re happy that my boyfriend and i are together because i ve made him into a better version of himself over the years .","309205":"i suppose it depends on how you look at it , because any self esteem at all is attributed to one s ego . generally speaking , however , if you refer to someone as egotistical , you re inferring that they re arrogant or entitled .","309206":"it s actually relieving , so in a strange way , yes .","309207":"somewhat but only people with whom i m close . i can read the body language of my boyfriend and best friend , but i would be fairly clueless when it comes to strangers unless it s something obvious like throwing their hands up in anger .","309208":"it falls under the same idea as fear of the unknown death is an unknown entity for most people , and it strikes fear into those who simply don t know what to expect after this life . death also raises the question of whether or not this life is even worth living in the first place , which can be a frightening thought to people .","309209":"hopefully i m still alive by then , lol . married , with a bunch of dogs , living in a house with my current boyfriend , with maybe a kid running around .","309210":"moving out of my parents house into an apartment with my boyfriend . hopefully we can do it this year it s essentially the next step in my recovery , and it would benefit me a lot to get out of this house .","309211":"for work , i write press releases for clients . that doesn t really adhere to a genre besides general non fiction , i would assume . in my free time , i write non fiction prose and i ve also written dramatic fictional works in the past that were loosely based on my life .","309212":"that happened to me often when i worked in retail . my coworkers and i usually did jobs that weren t necessarily our jobs , but they needed to be done anyway , so any time i would screw up , my bosses wouldn t be able to pinpoint who it was .","309213":"no , i don t think i m old at all . compared to the life expectancy of most adults these days , i m actually quite young . in addition , most of my friends are older than i am , so i feel quite young in comparison .","309214":"tried a cut crease , but you can t even tell from this photo . oh well","309215":"what my greatest achievements are i suppose my greatest achievement was graduating from college magna cum laude . i had put forward all of my effort into obtaining good grades alongside working more than hours per week . i was incredibly proud of what i did despite working so much and despite my mental health acting up on me . what words make me the best of myself i don t really know what this is supposed to mean i guess which words make me feel the best about myself ? i like when people call me intelligent , because my intelligence is something i m insecure about . i also like when people tell me i m a good writer , because i often have doubts .","309216":"deal with the source of your stress and try to alleviate it as much as you can . there are things you can do which can help you handle the way you cope with stress , such as doing your favorite activities or other things that allow you to escape , but those are only temporary . they don t actually get rid of the reason why you re stressed in the first place .","309217":"leigh lothlorien . no , but seriously i don t give out my full name on social media , that s a privacy concern . you can just call me leigh .","309218":"this is an accurate statement , yes .","309219":"aw , thank you ! ! tbh i only post photos of myself when i ve done my makeup or when i m feeling particularly confident that day in my regular skin . here s a photo of me today without makeup","309220":"solid oak , four drawers , with enough space on top to place my vanity set and a mirror .","309221":"ahh i m so excited for you , tea is amazing . it depends on which kinds of tea you prefer ! ! there s black tea , green tea , white tea , and herbal teas . i personally prefer various black and green teas , but there are also really good herbal teas out there as well . for starters , i would suggest trying out earl grey tea black tea because it has a nice bold flavor and you can put in sugar and milk , which makes it taste lovely . there are also a plethora of flavored green teas i personally like green tea with jasmine and green tea with lemon . however , there are countless other combinations that you can find if you go to your local grocery store , just pick a box that sounds yummy . there are also dozens upon dozens of herbal teas , like peach and raspberry and blueberry , as well as various chai teas which have spices in them , so good . it s really all a matter of experimentation and finding your taste . i think the best option for you would be finding a box of variety teas instead of buying single boxes of one flavor ! ! that way you save money and can try out different flavors .","309222":"it depends on the individual and what they re comfortable discussing . i don t think sex should be considered as taboo as it currently is , but people also shouldn t feel obligated to discuss their sex lives if they re not comfortable doing so . for example , i don t like talking about my sex life unless it s obviously with my boyfriend , or with my best friend . it doesn t mean that i m ashamed of sex , i just personally prefer to keep it a private matter .","309223":"i attend cognitive behavioral therapy sessions once per week , i see a psychiatrist once to twice per month , and i m on a steady dose of medications that i take every day . my psychological well being has greatly improved over the past year that i ve been in this routine , and i wish there wasn t such a stigma associated with mental health treatment . there s nothing wrong with getting proper , professional treatment for mental health , and it can greatly benefit you in the long run .","309224":"i ve always wanted to be a writer for as long as i could remember . i was writing stories even when i was a child , and by the time i was , i had moved into short stories and poetry . it s the only career choice that made sense to me .","309225":"i ve always lived in new york , which is probably the least intimate place in the united states , haha . people don t acknowledge strangers on the street , no one talks to one another waiting in a check out line , cashiers aren t treated as humans which i think happens in most places , unfortunately , etc . it s something i ve been accustomed to for a long time , so i ve never been in a position where i could relate to a stranger in a public setting .","309226":"death is permanent and unchanging . regardless of what we do in life , we will all end up six feet underground eventually .","309227":"i enjoy twitter , but it isn t confusing to me at all because i ve been using it for quite a number of years now . i usually use it to follow and keep updated on my friends , artists , gaming channels , and politics here and there .","309228":"oh my fucking god , stop sending me this woe is me , i m so old crap . you re years old . everyone you send this to , including myself , says you re young . in addition , the majority of people you ve sent this to are older than you are . you can attend college at any age . most of my college classmates were older than me , and there s nothing wrong with that . instead of feeling bad for yourself , go out and live your life to the best of your ability .","309229":"yeah , i definitely have . i missed the friendship and had second thoughts about ending the friendship to begin with . however , i had to keep reminding myself that i cut them off for a reason , they were a toxic person and their presence in my life caused more harm than good , and i m a better person without them .","309230":"i m about to say no to this current glass of white wine because it s legit the most disgusting wine i ve ever tasted and idk if i can even finish this glass .","309231":"a beer bottle opener that s in the shape of a shotgun shell .","309232":"i absolutely do after all , i ve been with my current boyfriend for nearly eight years and we ve essentially been through hell and back together . it takes a certain amount of love , support , dedication , and patience to withstand the things that we ve gone through together over the years .","309233":"i usually turn to alcohol , cigarettes , or drugs . i never said i had the best coping mechanisms .","309234":"i honestly think that they ve become a way to divide the american people into two sides liberal and conservative . instead of banding together as one group serving an equal purpose , politics has divided the country and force them to quarrel amongst themselves .","309235":"i don t have psychosis , so no . to believe one can converse with another aspect of themself is a symptom of hallucinations .","309236":"the same way people believe in religion or extraterrestrial life faith .","309237":"not generally , no . most of the time , i feel as if i m looking at things from afar and studying humanity like i m a scientist looking upon a lab test with mice .","309238":"no . i have enough going on in my life , i don t need to involve myself in other people s lives , especially those who mean nothing to me . gossiping is a juvenile act .","309239":"those pictures don t do justice to what the snow looked like hours later , believe it or not ! i think we got around inches total , but the intense wind made the snow appear much deeper than it actually was .","309240":"yeah , definitely tbh that idea has always appealed to me more than physically giving birth . being pregnant legitimately scares the shit out of me , lol . but that s plenty of years down the line from now , so it isn t something i really think about .","309241":"not at all . with the life expectancy of humans these days , being in your s is quite young . not to mention the fact that all of my friends and coworkers are significantly older than me .","309242":"i ve been on medication and have been attending therapy for over a year now . i m not as mentally unstable as i used to be , but i still have my moments and depressive episodes . they re just not nearly as intense now as they were prior to being in treatment .","309243":"we share pretty much everything we drink from the same cup , eat from the same plate sometimes , use the same fork , and one time , he even used my toothbrush although i find that one to be a little gross . i mean , we exchange bodily fluids so in comparison , most of the other things we share are mild , haha .","309244":"i m not really guilty to enjoy any of the things i enjoy , haha . i suppose the closest thing would be that i m fascinated by serial killers and true crime , but that s a common interest shared by many people .","309245":"i hated the fact that i often was attracted to people who had no interest in me , but i wouldn t say that i loved them .","309246":"i remember that too ! ! i was overwhelmed with happiness because it was so long overdue . i don t think people should ever be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation or gender identity , especially when it comes to things like marriage . there s a separation of church and state for a reason .","309247":"i agree with you ! ! my boyfriend played hockey for most of his life and has worked construction for many years as well , so he has the most beautiful back in my eyes . he isn t overly muscular , but he s very lean and you can trace the shape of the muscles on his back and see the dimples on the small of his back .","309248":"subtle beauty can be one of the most beautiful things about a person , tbh . i like thin wrists , collar bones , the shapes of people s shoulders , high cheekbones , jutting jawlines , and the groove down the center of people s backs .","309249":"i d venture a guess and say that health is merely a state of well being nobody is immune from illness , and it can be determined that while someone is sick with the common cold , it doesn t necessarily mean that they re unhealthy . an absence of illness is a rare thing , in my opinion .","309250":"was the year of the tattoos","309251":"women with sassy and defiant personalities who aren t afraid to embrace their individuality and tell the truth like it really is .","309252":"i m not vegan or vegetarian at the moment , as much as i would like to me . i have no control over the food that enters my household , so unfortunately i don t have much choice in the matter . i definitely want to transition to a vegetarian diet when i move out and get my own place , though .","309253":"i do , actually . i m in a fb group with a few other people as a place to vent and rant about our lives , and some of my old high school friends have revealed that they too have been diagnosed with bpd over the years . it s definitely helped a lot because it gives me a sense that i m not alone in my struggles and there are people whom i personally know who understand the ups and downs of having bpd .","309254":"google news it has most sources , such as npr , the new york times , bbc , the washington post , etc etc .","309255":"not at all it wouldn t be cost efficient to do everything by hand due to the amount of paper people would use on a daily basis . even if the computers somehow lost all of their files , they re backed up by cloud storage and can be easily accessible .","309256":"no , i don t see a reason to pay for their services . i don t mind the ads at all .","309257":"everything i do and have done has been on a computer . it would be nearly impossible to do my past and present job by hand , haha . everything i write and edit is stored in a database .","309258":"sitting on my bed , drinking a cup of coffee , and having a gif war with my boyfriend over fb messenger .","309259":"i cry at movies all the time because i m actually an emotional mess and can t control my emotions . i can t remember which movie i cried at last because i don t watch movies very often , but the tv shows parks recreation and how i met your mother made me cry plenty of times .","309260":"not very often , mostly because i don t go out in public very often besides the occasional errand and for work . when i first colored my hair pink , though , i had like strangers at my office building come up to me to tell me they loved my hair .","309261":"i do ! ! i haven t watched it in a long time , but i thoroughly enjoyed it .","309262":"mostly , thank you for asking ! ! i still gab congestion and fatigue , but my abdominal pain is mostly gone . i m happy it was only one of those hour bugs .","309263":"you sound like the same anon who had misconceptions about sex and gender and i had a few days ago . i m not going to have another silly debate about gender identity with you because it s simply a waste of time . i won t be answering any more of your questions , unfortunately .","309264":"in , let s read people s bios before we talk to them so that we can get an understanding of their gender identity and which pronouns to use . ?","309265":"there isn t any entertainment that s difficult for me to resist . i go in phases when it comes to media , i . e . movies or tv shows or video games . sometimes i ll be hooked to my tv screen playing a particular game , while other times i don t pick up my controller for weeks .","309266":"i have online friends from the uk and australia . idk if they re easier to talk to simply because they re not american , but we happened to click when we first began talking , much like any other friendship of mine .","309267":"sometimes , yeah . usually i m given no other option but to make the best out of a situation so i do what needs to be done with no questions asked . however , other times i admittedly allow my depression and anxiety to get the best of me , which makes getting over obstacles that much harder . every day is different so i don t know what to expect .","309268":"drinking tea coffee and watching tv having deep and meaningful talks with my boyfriend or best friend being around good friends around a small fire while having drinks writing creatively painting drawing coloring sleeping in with my boyfriend on rainy days going out into nature and taking photos","309269":"draco malfoy i always have had a soft spot for his character because he was obviously abvsed by his father and felt obligated to be interested in the darker side of things due to his family history . by the end of the series , he came to a mutual understanding with harry due to their experiences . idk i ve always found his character to be complex and interesting .","309270":"logan paul filmed a vlog the other day when he visited one of japan s sacred forests it s known internationally as the svicide forest due to the alarming high number of svicides there . i didn t watch the video , but he and his friends allegedly stumbled upon the dead corpse of a man who had completed svicide by hanging . instead of turning off the camera , they zoomed in on the body , was laughing and making jokes , and then he proceeded to upload the video to youtube .","309271":"rightfully so . unfortunately , however , it hasn t disappeared from the internet and its impact has already been felt on impressionable teenagers and other people with past trauma .","309272":"logan paul is a vile human being who tried to exploit the death of another human being to garner likes and views on social media he wasn t trying to raise awareness for mental health and svicide prevention , and his apology was half hearted and narcissistic at best . you don t go into a sacred forest with a camera and continue filming , continue laughing , and zoom in and focus on a corpse in an effort to raise awareness . what he did was extremely disrespectful , and his decision to put that video on the internet for everyone to see was foolish and selfish .","309273":"you already know my thoughts about this old bullshit . if you re going to complain about how old you think you are at years old , you re better off talking to people who are younger than you , not five years your senior .","309274":". prisoner of azkaban . . sorcerer s stone . . deathly hallows part

believe that it exists . there are so many people who commit terrible crimes and do generally bad things to other people in this life , and they wind up walking away free from punishment . in the same vein , there are also so many good people who have benefitted this world but they always seem to find themselves in terrible and tragic positions . bad things seem to happen to them without warrant or reason .","309277":"everyone i follow , pretty much . i wouldn t want to list certain people out and not others because i wouldn t want anyone to feel left out or angry .","309278":"moreso the latter i always knew that i felt uncomfortable with my body and with the idea of being a girl or a woman , but i didn t know that being gender fluid or non binary existed until a few years ago , thanks to the internet . when i did my research , i was amazed at how fitting it seemed and it gave me a lot of comfort and validation , knowing that i wasn t alone in my feelings and that there was something that described who i was .","309279":"writing , proofreading , applying makeup , photography , and drinking large quantities of wine in short time periods .","309280":"i think so too , haha . every quiz i take says either ravenclaw or slytherin , but i personally agree more with ravenclaw .","309281":"getting questions doesn t make me happy , but it raises my curiosities . that being said , half of my notifications aren t even valid questions so i ve learned not to get my hopes up .","309282":"for social media , i use askfm and snapchat the most . for everything else , i use afterlight and photogrid as photo editors , spotify to listen to music , medisafe to keep track of my medications , and my bank app to keep track of my balances , statements , and deposits .","309283":"prozac , rexulti , xanax , cigarettes , and wine .","309284":"i just finished ! ! i m proud of my wings for once , haha .","309285":"this is strangely endearing , lol . thank you regardless ! ! i m just doing

some items like vitamins and paper towels and toilet paper , i buy in bulk . other items such as deoderant and razors , i buy singular .","309289":"it s just a personal opinion . to me , it shows that someone cares but they re not trying too hard to impress . a bouquet of roses seems over the top to me and a waste of money . i m sure other people have different opinions , but that s my take on it .","309290":"their career , hobbies they enjoy , their family as long as it isn t too personal , their schooling if they re in school , etc etc . since the holidays just passed , you can ask them how they spent their holiday . just don t bring up past dating history or politics , at least not yet . that can be saved for a later date .","309291":"i m quite happy with my plans tonight , actually . it s one of the first new years i ll be able to spend away from home , since i absolutely hate being around my family for this holiday . i m going to my best friend s apartment and will be drinking and spending the night there .","309292":"yikes , that s terrible ! ! i m glad that my bank is good when it comes to fraud , i just need to call them again and remind them that i need my money asap .","309293":"thank you . i m just pissed because it s been one week and my money isn t back into my account yet , and the fraudulent charges aren t even pending anymore they got charged to my account . i m going to have to call the bank and get this shit sorted otherwise i m not going to be able to pay my bills for january .","309294":"i m currently working with my bank to get back over , that was stolen from me on christmas eve . i can t even donate one dollar to myself , let alone a stranger on the internet .","309295":"happy new years eve , friends and happy new year to my friends in australia ! ! ? let s start off right with some interesting questions ! !","309296":"i have a subscription to netflix , and i also pay a monthly gym membership fee even though i haven t gone in eight months , ugh . there aren t really any others that i would want to subscribe to . perhaps hulu one day , but right now i m leeching off of my friend s hulu account to watch the x files , so it isn t really necessary .","309297":"no , but that s probably something i should do in order to actually remember what my resolutions are .","309298":"the death of two of my idols chester bennington and chris cornell . their music and personalities had such a profound impact on me , and it s still hard for me to believe that they passed . i still cry when i listen to their music .","309299":"it wasn t so much of a new years resolution , but in december , i had a major incident with my mental health and told myself that i would try to seek professional treatment . i stuck to that thought and managed to find a psychiatrist within a few months . afterwards , i started trying different therapists to find one that worked for me . my journey to recovery has been long and extremely hard and strange , but i m happy that i finally took that step forward , otherwise my health would have declined rapidly .","309300":"it s am and i m laying in bed , i really don t feel like getting into the details of systemic oppression right now . if you re going to talk about spanish people , just say spanish . it s not that hard .","309301":"that s an extremely racist way to put it , but yeah , he s spanish .","309302":"thank you ! ! i got them for xmas and just got around to washing them today . they re super soft and warm , and i m so excited to go to bed tonight .","309303":"not at all ! ! i understand that english isn t the first language of most people who use askfm , so i appreciate any question as long as i can understand their intentions .","309304":"for me , there was no transition . besides obviously turning , there was nothing that changed in my life between being a teenager and adult . granted i accumulated more responsibilities , but that was gradual and wasn t anything unusual or shocking for me . i ve been paying my own bills ever since i started having bills .","309305":"no . i m younger than most of the people in my life , and i still have many milestones to complete before my death .","309306":"whales are kept in captivity in aquariums , like sea world and stuff .","309307":"that doesn t much matter if the animals are unhappy , which most of them are . the last time i went to a zoo , i couldn t stand it because the animals looked terrible , they were extremely unhappy , and they weren t being taken care of properly . sanctuaries can be a different story because they re treated right in most sanctuaries , but most zoos are terrible .","309308":"an anon is arguing with me on curiouscat and claiming that i force my mental illnesses other other

different feeling than being drunk , i felt uncomfortable .","309312":"i m currently coloring i was watching the x files , but felt like testing out the new colored pencils i got for xmas . they re pretty good . i think i m going to hop on destiny before the holiday events are over , it s been two weeks since i ve played .","309313":"i feel personally attacked by this relatable content","309314":"no , it was just an anon attempting to start drama . i sent a message to stephen apologizing on the anon s behalf , but it appears that he hasn t logged in since yesterday .","309315":"happy saturday , everyone ! ! ? i m in a great mood , so some questions would be quite lovely","309316":"sadness usually has a reason behind it you re stressed out , someone passed away , you lost a friend , work has been rough , etc etc . it goes away relatively fast . depression is long lasting and doesn t need to have a reason . depression is defined by periods of sadness , fatigue , lack of interest in activities , loss of focus , svicidal thoughts , etc . to be diagnosed with depression , you must have a certain amount of symptoms i think two or three every day for at least two weeks .","309317":"i think maine coons are so beautiful , and although i m not much of a cat person , i would love to adopt one of those . as for dogs , i don t discriminate and basically love every dog i meet . i especially love huskies , german shepards , pitbulls , mastiffs , corgis , and golden retrievers .","309318":"not a bother at all ! ! i love animals , and i m going to adopt so many of them once i move into my own house , lmao . i definitely want at least one dog , and naturally my boyfriend is going to bring his fish and dragon with us as well . i also love guinea pigs and rats and hamsters , so we ll see .","309319":"abnormal psychology dealing with disorders of the brain , behavioral health , cognitive dysfunction , etc etc . it s always been a subject that greatly interested me due to my own experiences .","309320":"idk if i showed you this photo before , but look how tiny she used to be ! !","309321":"any instances of abvse , whether it s verbal or physical or sxxual . if you come towards me with abvse of any kind , then i m doing everything in my power to cut you off and warn everyone i know about you . abvsers don t deserve sympathy .","309322":"start

of my parents house move in with my boyfriend adopt a dog","309323":"you must have the wrong person because i m not even a girl .","309324":"i ve progressed a lot in my recovery and i ve become more accepting of my diagnoses i m trying to use my experiences to educate others about mental health in general . in addition , i m not as introverted and socially withdrawn as i used to be . i ve learned how to be open with my feelings and put my foot down if need be , because i m beginning to respect myself .","309325":"i don t think it would hurt , but i also don t think it s overly necessary either . these platforms are functioning well the way they are now , so i don t think that it would make any significant difference . there are a lot of other changes these social media platforms can make that are of higher importance than that .","309326":"ahh , thank you ! ! this means a lot to me","309327":"i already have . seriously though stop messaging me . i m going to bed , and i don t want notifications in the morning because you think i abandoned you .","309328":"lol is this for real . on this note , i m going to bed . thanks for the laughs , anon . i ll be going to sleep with a smile on my face .","309329":". . . you re implying that my gender identity doesn t exist because you insist that i m a girl despite me indicating otherwise . that s pretty much the same thing as invalidating someone because that infers that trans people s identities don t matter . i m done debating about this with you , though .","309330":"literally the entire conversation this anon and i are having is about identity politics , so your analogy is totally correct . regardless , i m not going to entertain their thoughts anymore . it s stupid to go back and forth with someone who clearly isn t listening or acknowledging the existence of an entire group of people .","309331":"i would entertain this notion , but i m honestly not interested anymore because it s clear to me that you re simply transphobic and aren t worth any more space on my profile . trans lives are real and valid , no matter what you have to say about it . i m not going to stop identifying as non binary simply because an anon doesn t think i exist . that s silly .","309332":"your rationale has been illogical thus far , and you haven t presented me with any facts either . you can try to hold yourself up on a pedestal , but based on your responses , you re having a rough time getting up there . to be fair , this entire conversation has been a derivative of identity politics . you re not doing yourself any favors by throwing that word around now .","309333":"this is so cute , aw . thank you","309334":"i usually only answer questions on my phone , as i m rarely on my laptop . a few years ago , askfm wasn t available on mobile , so answering questions on the computer was the only option we had . however , i do prefer it on the phone now because the layout makes it extremely easy to sort through answer questions , and i can do it virtually any time of day .","309335":"i can understand where you re getting lost too , and it s a shame that we can t come to a formal agreement . something that has been shared by millions of people is more than just a feeling . considering you re cis , you wouldn t understand this yourself , but being trans is more than just a feeling . it s someone s entire world , the definition of their being , something so significant that it dictates whether they live or die . the idea that so many people share these experiences , in so many different cultures , and throughout different time periods , assumes that being trans is more than just a fleeting feeling . it s clear that you re not going to understand the intricacies of being trans , however . we re just going in circles .","309336":"i wasn t aware that i was blindly agreeing to anything silly me . is this in response to the fat question ? my response wasn t a lie , if that s what you re wondering .","309337":"if you ve done any research at all , you would know that it s literally documented in history than genders aside from man and woman have existed for centuries . facts are based upon historical data and evidence if you took the time out of your day to research this evidence instead of having a debate with a stranger , you would clearly see that .","309338":"thick is clearly just a politically correct way of stating that someone is fat . yes i m fat .","309339":"i called you condescending , your attempts to discredit me as childish , and your ignorance of trans culture to be a product of brainwashing . i don t really understand how you think that means i can t handle things that are thrown my way ? i m just simply pointing out what i ve observed over the few interactions i ve had with you and people like you who have tried to question my gender in the past . you re all the same , tbh .","309340":"lol , that s actually hilarious . honestly , i don t really care about who my anon is i get these types of people occasionally , and they come and go after they realize that they can t squash the trans out of me . askfm is a lot more fun with anon activated , at any rate . my page wouldn t nearly be as active if i could only receive non anonymous questions , and knowing me , i would keep forgetting to turn the feature back on .","309341":"this condescending attitude is quite sickening , and i honestly believe you should educate yourself on trans culture before you think you can talk to a trans person as if you know them better than they know themselves . it doesn t matter to me what you think i am because it simply isn t the truth . so whether you would like to accept that truth or not , i m still who i am at the end of the day .","309342":"i can explain why you re wrong , so here s a completely random analogy that makes no logical sense in comparison to what i m talking about and citing a myth that has no scientific basis and hasn t been included in mental health discussions since the s","309343":"it s honestly just a useless and childish way of trying to invalidate someone s identity and experiences perhaps if anon was actually talking about something that wasn t based on scientific evidence , then i would understand their justification . but gender identity has existed for centuries , and unfortunately those who oppose trans people have brainwashed themselves to believe that trans people have only existed in the past years out of cultural spite instead of educating themselves on trans culture .","309344":"if we re talking scientific facts , then you ll be delighted to know that gender identity is a very valid and real thing , existing for centuries in a plethora of cultures on anthropological , sociological , psychological , and biological levels . you can t simply disrespect trans individuals because you don t agree with the reality of the world . needless to say , there are more than two genders because your gender identity isn t equivalent to your biological sex . you re correct in that i m biologically female , but i ve never identified as a girl , nor will i ever .","309345":"if you read my profile , you would know that i m non binary . regardless , i m all right just laying in bed and watching the x files . i m debating on going to bed , but i honestly don t want to wake up and go to work tomorrow morning .","309346":"i like mostly earth tones blood red , emerald , navy , beige , gray , and black . they ve always brought to me a sense of tranquility because they re colors found in nature , and they remind me of forests and oceans .","309347":"my day was all right i had a throbbing headache for most of the day , which only disappeared about an hour ago . i also got out of work half an hour early , which was nice . i m currently just relaxing , drinking a cup of coffee , and watching the x files .","309348":"i have the mouth of a dirty sailor it doesn t show much when i type online , but it comes out pretty often when i m actually speaking in real life . i mostly use the words shit , fuck , and bullshit .","309349":"one of my old coworkers is obsessed with the x files , so i found the series on hulu and i m excited to start watching it ! ! i know it isn t the most exciting thing , but i always like getting into new shows , especially ones with a lot of seasons .","309350":"i think feminism is an important part of everyone s lives , whether they realize it or not . feminism advocates for not only the equality amongst men and women , but also among different races , genders , sexual orientations , religions , etc etc . feminism promotes understanding and equality of all of these factors . in that same vein , feminism also benefits men it seeks to eradicate the hypermasculinity of society , thereby making it more socially acceptable for men to show emotion and grow up in a non violent environment .","309351":"i ve always wanted to learn how to play the piano . i ve always been interested in music since i was young , and it s such a beautiful instrument .","309352":"well no , to be quite honest . i don t consider myself to be very smart at all , but i thanked that anon anyway because regardless of my thoughts , it was a nice thing for them to say .","309353":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","309354":"mostly because i m uncomfortable with most male doctors . i ve had male doctors in the past and i didn t have good experiences with them , nor did i feel comfortable with them , so i usually request female doctors .","309355":"the only person from askfm i know in real life is courrtana ! ! we met after talking on askfm","309356":"i delete sexual questions and obvious attempts at trolling .","309357":"that depends on the doctor , really . i ve had some female doctors who were accepting and open minded while others weren t .","309358":"i ve always been more comfortable with female doctors , regardless of their specialty .","309359":"blocking and reporting is unfortunately the only thing you can do on askfm . you did the right thing . however , don t allow it to discourage you . people who feel the need to harass others often have major inner conflicts of their own , and they never learned how to deal with them the right away . their words aren t the truth and they re a reflection of what they think of themselves , not you . don t allow those words to hurt you because they re empty and meaningless .","309360":"dis ease d z z noun a disorder of structure or function in a human , animal , or plant , especially one that produces specific signs or symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury .","309361":"i try not to , but i notice that i often get reminded of the things people have done to me over the years and get angry at them all over again .","309362":"not really . my memory is terrible , but i m more apt to remember names as opposed to faces . if i meet a person once , chances are that i won t remember who they are the next time i meet them .","309363":"sorry not sorry for all of the selfies lately","309364":"if you didn t get the hint from the fact that i used your last question as a filler , let me make it simple for you i have no interest in answering questions like these .","309365":"you re a good person if you have good intentions at heart . you want to help your friends or your family or even strangers , and you don t go out of your way to purposely hurt people . most people are good people .","309366":"if the person is a stranger , then it isn t my place to tell them how to live their life unless they were actively svicidal and had intentions to end their life . then i would phone the police on their behalf and get them the help they need . if it was a friend or family member , then i would talk to them about their behavior and let them know how their behavior is affecting their relationships and that i m there for them . you can t fix people who do not want to help themselves , though . you can only give them the avenues to recovery , but you can t force a person to get help .","309367":"look at the moon nightlight my boyfriend got me , it s so pretty","309368":"i don t usually bother with making resolutions because i rarely follow through with them not necessarily because i m lazy or unmotivated , but because life often gets in the way and suddenly you find yourself living a completely different life than you expected .","309369":"this defines pretty much three quarters of my life because i have memory loss and cannot remember the majority of my life especially any age prior to the age of . in addition , i ve endured a lot of alcohol and drug fueled nights where i would black out , so my friends would have to fill me in on the details the next day .","309370":"i don t really remember the reason why i drank or smoked to begin with , since i was a teenager at the time . i do remember using alcohol in my freshman year of college as an escape from my depression , and smoking was a stress reliever for me . these days , smoking is simply an addiction and it calms me , while alcohol relaxes me at the end of the day .","309371":"i suppose cigarettes is the most logical answer to this question i know cigarettes are terrible for your health and can kill you , but i still smoke and continue to purchase packs of cigarettes every few days .","309372":"i absolutely love the peach palette i also got a lot of new makeup brushes , so i was able to actually apply the makeup correctly and with precision . my profile picture is the outcome of the peach palette and some winged liner , and it makes me so proud of my makeup abilities , haha .","309373":"i have no intentions of becoming close to another person , especially considering you re an anonymous stranger from a social media website . you can ask me questions since that s the purpose of askfm , but that s the extent of what i ll be comfortable doing .","309374":". . . i m not here to argue with you because this is an asinine thing to argue with someone about . but is very young i m four years older than you , and i don t even consider myself to be old . you have the rest of your life ahead of you . enjoy your youth while it lasts .","309375":"usually it s because they re creeps and perverts who think it s an acceptable question to ask someone simply because they re hiding behind an anonymous pseudonym . virginity isn t even a physical thing , in any respect . it s a social construct that doesn t realistically exist .","309376":"my boyfriend got me a realistic moon nightlight , a new over the shoulder bag , a pandora charm , a keychain with words of affirmations on it , a destiny the video game journal , and chocolates . as for what the rest of my family got me , i mostly got clothing , coffee , snacks for work , a lot of tea , an eyeshadow palette and mascara , and a vanity set to store my makeup .","309377":"i m kind and courteous to everyone i meet unless they give me a reason to behave otherwise .","309378":"i portray myself to be highly intelligent because i was taught how to string words into sentences in a logical and eloquent fashion . however , i m always afraid that i m not as smart as people perceive me to be , especially considering it s been four years since i ve been in school .","309379":"it depends on the individual and what they ve done to me if it s someone i m close with , then i m more apt to forgive them if it s a first offense . however , if they keep repeating the behavior , then they re at risk of getting cut loose . if it s a person i barely know and they wrong me , then i have no emotional attachment to them and i cut them loose immediately .","309380":"i took a video of it and put it on my snapchat because people kept asking me to do so , hahah . he s so excited , though . i can t wait to go to the concert with him .","309381":"i am quite happy right now although i am drunk .","309382":"makeup of the day","309383":"my xmas day has just begun , but it s going well i ended up staying up until am organizing my gifts and taking some things out of boxes . it s am now , and i m just in the process of making breakfast . after i eat , i m going to get together all of my gifts for my boyfriend for tonight and get ready for my aunt s house . and yes , i plan on getting absolutely trashed .","309384":"serve me a glass of red wine or a cup of coffee .","309385":"no shit , fucknut . obviously it s an inappropriate question so i answered it the way i wanted to .","309386":"i prefer large wine glasses over small wine glasses .","309387":"just spent the last minutes doing my makeup","309388":"no one knows your religion if they just look at you . regardless , it s the thought that counts .","309389":"i don t have any photos from my childhood . here s a photo from when i was , though","309390":"i can understand that my family does the same thing with the information they do know , which is why i don t tell them about my diagnoses other than depression anxiety . you might have to sit your mother down again and explain how it makes you feel , and that she should respect your privacy when it comes to something as sensitive as your mental health .","309391":"if i was single , then i would thank him for the compliment and tell him i m not interested in dating , so i wouldn t be giving him my number . when i was single , i usually had no intentions of entering a relationship and pretty much wanted nothing to do with men . my relationship with my boyfriend was different because we ended up being good friends first before dating one another , so it felt more natural and it wasn t forced .","309392":"if there s no chance at all of her having feelings for you back , then you need to tell yourself that your feelings aren t going to bring you any happiness and that you re only going to hurt yourself . i understand that it s difficult to get over a person , but you need to do this for yourself and you can t keep pining over someone who will never reciprocate your feelings .","309393":"i absolutely love the snow i think it s beautiful and makes everything sound much more quiet . however , i hate driving in the snow . plows don t do their jobs well enough where i live , which makes the roads icy .","309394":"i m years old , and no , i wouldn t classify myself as old . most people i interact with are older than me .","309395":"you seem as if you re barely active and i can t understand answers that aren t in english . i won t be following you , sorry .","309396":"i have , actually . i used to sell candy bars at basketball games and the proceeds went towards a scholarship named after my boyfriend s late mother .","309397":"if i had a choice of changing my career , i would want to become a forensic anthropologist . i find the subject matter to be incredibly interesting . i would definitely have to go to college for it , though . it would probably take at least an extra four to six years of schooling .","309398":"her name is quinn , and she s my favorite . my boyfriend has raised her since she was like rd of the size she is now . she gives kisses and watches the fish in his fish tanks , lol .","309399":"echomyname look how big this baby is ! !","309400":"i made a macklemore playlist on my spotify account so that i can listen to his songs and attempt to memorize them before my boyfriend and i go to his concert in july . i m going to eventually add some kesha songs on there too , since she s also going to be at the same concert .","309401":"idk why it even became a fashion trend because it originated from gang members to indicate the deeds they ve done to move up within the gang . needless to say , i wouldn t do that to my own eyebrows . i don t need to get any negative attention from the gangs in my area .","309402":"lol to me , a night out on the town is literally just a friend and me going to the local pub for a few beers . i would probably wear whatever i wore to work that day , which is usually some sort of tank top with a sweater , skinny jeans , and boots . other times , it s a hoodie . i m not looking to impress anyone , so i have no reason to dress nicely . we would go to the local pub that i ve been frequenting since i was years old . it s basically the only bar i go to because it s low key and i know the bartenders there .","309403":"my favorite feature on my boyfriend is probably his smile he has a huge , cheeky grin with dimples on both sides , and it never fails to cheer me up . if i had to guess , i think my boyfriend s favorite feature on me is either my face or my ass lol .","309404":"i ve used bath bombs and bubbles , but never bath salts . i prefer the bath bombs from lush because they smell amazing and leaves my skin super soft . my vest friend bought me a bath soak for my birthday that has dead sea salt , oats , spirulina , hibiscus , sunflower , and juniper berries . i haven t used it yet , but it smells great .","309405":"i m independent and can hold my own , so yes . i m pretty much on my own already with the exception of having my parents roof over my head . i often have to take care of my parents as well as myself , so it s not as if i m only looking out for my own needs .","309406":"yeah , absolutely we re not planning on pursuing marriage until we move in together , though .","309407":"xmas stresses me out , but overall i enjoy watching people open gifts that i bought them and seeing their reactions . i don t very much like seeing my family , but that s unfortunately unavoidable .","309408":"i never said thank you . regardless , i m not at work so i don t care about grammar .","309409":"i m pretty obsessed with true crime documentaries , especially about murderers and drug lords . it isn t something i talk about often because there s never an opportunity to really discuss it , but it s something i genuinely enjoy .","309410":"taught me that i m more than my trauma and that my struggles over the years are valid i ve done the best i could despite my circumstances , and i m a lot stronger than i give myself credit for . i ve endured situations and rose above them more times than i can count , and i can conquer anything that comes my way .","309411":"from my experience , people put on a fake smile and pretend that everything in their life is going well , which can sometimes turn into a competition amongst family members . it s sickening to me , probably because i always feel at my worst during the holiday season and i have no patience for people s fake personas .","309412":"i ll definitely look into it ! ! thank you . courrtana might be interested in this too .","309413":"when was the last time you treated a person with decency and respect ?","309414":"a snapchat that one of my friends sent me it was a license plate that said lit hoe , lmao .","309415":"i went to an xmas party last saturday at my best friend s apartment , which was a lot of fun . we ended up drinking and playing cards against humanity .","309416":"i m tired of mentally ill people using their diagnoses or self diagnoses , in most cases to excuse their malicious or manipulative behavior . your diagnosis is an explanation of your tendencies , not an excuse for you to allow yourself to continue fulfilling those tendencies . if you re aware of your shitty behavior and brush it off as oh it s a symptom of my xyz syndrome , i can t help it , then you re aware that what you re doing is wrong and you re not doing anything to stop it . take accountability for your actions and stop blaming your mental illness for your shitty behavior . it adds to the stigma associated with a lot of illnesses and makes other sufferers look bad .","309417":"my job trusted me with proofreading a page feature for our annual magazine , and i think my eyes are going to melt out of my skull by the time i m done . send coffee , please .","309418":"all kinds , tbh . my favorites at the moment are ginger jasmine , earl grey , darjeeling , white peach , and english breakfast ! ! i mostly drink black tea with a little bit of milk and splenda , but i also love various blends of green and white teas . i don t have a preference when it comes to brands , as long as it s not lipton . i usually drink twinings , stash , traditional medicinals , tazo , and numi . this is the tea caddy i m going to bring to work with me","309419":"going

giving my boyfriend and my family the xmas gifts i bought them . i like watching people open gifts that i know they ll enjoy , and i m super excited to see my boyfriend s reaction when he finds out i bought him tickets to see macklemore .","309422":"i m angry today . i lost a full pack of cigarettes last night , i woke up late for work , and i had to spend the first three hours of my day without coffee and i was almost falling asleep at my desk . i know that my anger is mostly irrational but i can t help but feel angry , and it can t dissipate no matter what i try to do . i m just a fucking

birth control i m against the death penalty i m against most forms of self diagnosis your mental illness doesn t excuse you from manipulative or abvsive behavior marijuana should be legalized college tuition is too expensive minimum wage should be raised","309430":"i think it s a bit ridiculous people are obligated to buy gifts for their loved ones , even if they don t have the money to spend on gifts . xmas should be about spending time with family and friends , but the commercialization of the holiday has made it more about who has the best gift as opposed to being thankful for what we already have .","309431":"isn t that the purpose of askfm . . . ? ? i always answer truthfully .","309432":"i would prefer a small wedding because it would be less expensive and less stressful . however , that realistically probably won t happen because my boyfriend has a very large family and he would feel obligated to invite most of them .","309433":"i don t do drugs often anymore , and the only one i ve used recently has been marijuana . i have no intentions of stopping because it helps me sleep when i m having a particularly bad night .","309434":"the only times i feel free are when i m under the influence of drugs alcohol . when i m sober , i often feel restricted and caged because i m still stuck in an abvsive environment . it s difficult to feel free when you still live with the

people believe the ideologies that they do . it s unfortunate because we could all learn a lot from each other if people just took the time to allow others to explain themselves instead of jumping to false conclusions . they have unresolved anger , and the only way they honestly know how to express that is by ragging on other people on the internet .","309456":"where have i used white feminism to insult women ? i haven t even talked about feminism in months .","309457":"it was toxic for me because i was part of the mental health community and it made focus more on my bad habits and downfalls and trauma to the point where i would become depressed and dissociate whenever i logged on . in addition , being on tumblr made me relapse because of the triggering content i would see on my dashboard , so i decided to stop using it for my own health .","309458":"i m honestly not doing well today . i spent the entire morning crying and having anxiety attacks . i called out of work because my mind has been racing and i can t focus on anything without being overcome with anxiety .","309459":"idk where you got the impression that i use white feminism to make myself seem superior to other people because i haven t talked about feminism in quite some time . regardless , the idea of white feminism is still misguided and doesn t take into account the experiences of people of color and other intersections . it s not immune to discussion and criticism .","309460":"the idea of being pregnant alone scares me more than the idea of giving birth , haha .","309461":"i think ghosting people is acceptable , especially if the person in question isn t a good friend , makes unwanted advances , or makes you uncomfortable . if someone never did anything wrong , then i think ghosting them is rude

talk faster and don t have much control over my voice .","309480":"not really i have no desire to be close with my neighbors or community , and tbh i hate when people recognize me when i go out , so i m perfectly content with living in a bigger town .","309481":"it s so pretty outside","309482":"i m terrified to drive while it s snowing which is why i got a ride to my best friend s mother s house today instead of driving myself . however , after it s done snowing and the roads have been cleared , i m usually okay . snow is safe to drive in under certain circumstances i . e . the roads are adequately plowed , you have the right tires to drive in snowy weather , you know how to handle yourself in case roads get slippery , etc etc . the problem is that most roads aren t plowed adequately , which makes it extremely unsafe for people to drive in snowy weather . especially in places like the southern us they re not used to getting snow so they re not given the proper tools to make the roads safe to drive .","309483":"it only started snowing today , but it s been snowing on and off all day we ve only accumulated maybe two or three inches .","309484":"oh no someone on the internet doesn t like video games . what shall i do now ? ?","309485":"i enjoyed school a lot the only thing i didn t enjoy was the bullying i endured from my peers . however , i always loved education and learning new things . college was really enjoyable for me because i was being taught things i was genuinely interested in .","309486":"i have a terrible habit of keeping gifts regardless of whether i like it or not because i would feel too guilty telling the person who gave me the gift that it wasn t something i enjoyed .","309487":"playing video games , reading , coloring , photography , and painting . unfortunately , i haven t had much time to take part in most of my hobbies in quite a while .","309488":"this sounds like a poorly written introduction to a shitty teen romance novel .","309489":"personally speaking , i don t believe that i can change the world by myself however , i do try to make small changes within my online community by spreading awareness of mental health needs , stigmas that should be erased , etc . i m also a strong supporter of disability rights , which is something that s also misunderstood in society .","309490":"i m doing all right nothing terrible , but not well either . i had a panic attack last night and was crying for hours . i ended up meeting a few friends at the bar and we stayed out until am just drinking and talking . it was a good distraction . i ve been dog sitting for the past few hours , so my mood has been somewhat even it s quiet in the house , which is a nice change from what i m used to . i m just sitting at the kitchen table with a coffee and playing on my phone before i have to feed the dogs in a little while .","309491":"there isn t a universal answer to this question , so it depends entirely on the people in the relationship . some people are ready for marriage when they re , others aren t ready until they re , and some people aren t interested in marriage at all . it s entirely subjective . if you can see yourself with your partner for the long haul , can deal with their flaws and quirks and bad habits , and or can see them as a parent if you re interested in having kids , then you may be ready for marriage .","309492":"my father . he was kind enough to drive me to starbucks and then to my best friend s mother s house so that i didn t have to drive in the snow this morning .","309493":"i express my emotions by talking about them or by writing down how i m feeling . askfm is actually beneficial to me because it s a safe space for me to talk about my feelings and emotions without getting negative feedback from people in my life . i have a lot of strong emotions , so it s important for me to express them regularly .","309494":"no . bad people don t necessarily get punished for their wrongdoings , and good people aren t rewarded as they should be . i used to like to believe in the concept of karma , but i ve watched too many shitty people go unscathed and too many genuinely good people get taken advantage of .","309495":"ahhh , i love birbs . they re so intelligent . thank you , it definitely did cheer me up a bit ! ! this one is probably one of my favorites https youtu . be

it didn t exist .","309498":"i m unaware that ben said anything about me regardless , his opinion is worth as much as a piece of shit on the bottom of my shoe , so it wouldn t phase me anyway . thanks for the concern , though","309499":"i disagree . mothers have a choice regarding whether or not they want to breast feed that choice is theirs alone and requires no intervention from outside parties .

at work , and i have a new job , so we re slowly saving up money to move in together .","309502":"going home and going the fuck to sleep . my boyfriend and i were up until am just talking last night , so i got barely any sleep . i enjoyed our conversation a lot so i don t regret it , but i m exhausted .","309503":"i would probably be mad and upset because at that point , i would have raised them to know better than to have sex so young and without protection . however , considering the deed would have already been done , i would ask them what they want to do with the pregnancy and go from there . if i had a son , i would probably explain that he needs to be in that child s life one way or another , even if things don t work out between him and the girl .","309504":"why would i be mad at them ? ? you can t control your sexuality and i would love my child regardless no matter what their sexual orientation or gender identity is .","309505":"this is starting to sound like a pee fetish , so i m going to politely decline to answer questions pertaining to this matter .","309506":"it depends on the person because everyone has different needs . however , generally i like to take them out for coffee tea drinks if they re feeling up to it , talk them through whatever situation they have going on , and offer them advice and support and reassurance .","309507":"is this true ? i haven t paid much attention to the news lately . i pretty much disagree with everything trump stands for , so that should answer your question .","309508":"i ll take that , haha . thank you","309509":"you have quite the uncommon perception of what americans and what women look like .","309510":"i m grateful that i have a warm bed and cozy pajama pants at home , because the second i get home from work , i m cozying the fuck up and curling into a ball so i won t have to be in so much pain .","309511":"no . i have no one that i have to impress , so i don t usually care about what i look like on a day to

who popped up when i did the sign , so go follow them all ! !","309513":"i think the idea behind manipulation is bad because you re literally using someone s behavior and personality against them in order to do what you want them to do . however , i m aware that sometimes it can be used in good faith . . . which is something that still rubs me the wrong way , but whatever .","309514":"i ve never watched it , but i heard good things about it .","309515":"thank you ! ! have a good night","309516":"i don t know the answer to this question . perhaps everyone else just speaks too slowly .","309517":"it s obviously a false sense of power they convince themselves that they re in control or have authority over others , when really they re very powerless due to the lack of control they have over their own life .","309518":"like i stated before , it gives them a sense of power and control . while it doesn t directly improve the initial problem that they re trying to deal with , it makes them feel better about themselves temporarily .","309519":"from my understanding , it s usually because the bullies often have dysfunctional home lives and never learned how to express their anger and frustration properly except through fear and violence it s a power trip , bullies like having the sense of being in control because they usually have no control over problems at home .","309520":"aw , thank you you have to remember that middle school and high school kids are often cruel and selfish they ridicule anything that s different from the norm , especially people who are seen as an easy target .","309521":"i have one fish at the moment . however , i often like to think that my boyfriend s two dogs are also my pets by association due to how much time i spend at his house lol .","309522":"that sounds interesting ! ! i ll definitely have to look into it","309523":"i attend therapy on a weekly basis , which is probably the healthiest thing i do to help me sort through and understand my issues . i also perform various acts of self care when i feel stressed , i . e . candles , tea , being snuggled up in blankets , netflix , etc .","309524":"sometimes , but i usually rationalize it to myself so that i don t feel as bad about the situation . for example , i tend to get jealous of some high school peers who i follow on social media some of them have houses now , which used to make me jealous and angry until i realized that there was no possible way they could afford it on their own unless their parents contributed . it doesn t seem as independent anymore , to me anyway . however , over the years i ve compared myself less and less with people because it only has bad outcomes . i should live up to my own expectations , not those cast by the people around me .","309525":"i have seven tattoos ! ! they re on my left arm , left forearm , ribcage , shoulder blades , left calf , right ankle , and on top of my right thigh . i m hoping to get at least two more after the holidays .","309526":"don t worry friends , my hair is still pink","309527":"the same reason why most people consume alcohol in unhealthy manners it numbs them to their pain and provides a sense of euphoria that life can t provide for them at that moment . i m like everyone else in that everyone has problems that they deal with on a daily basis . however , i never said that i developed healthy ways of coping with those problems . my perception of my problems is disordered .","309528":"not saying no isn t consent . not saying no isn t consent . not saying no isn t consent . not saying no isn t consent . not saying no isn t consent . not saying no isn t consent . not saying no isn t consent . not saying no isn t consent .","309529":"i got two coffees throughout the course of the day instead of my usual one coffee in the morning . i ve had a rough few days , so it was more of a mental pick me up than a physical one .","309530":"i never said i was good at math , buddy . but nevertheless , you should try your best at the final exam .","309531":"i agree , there will always be people who aren t meant for a retail setting . however , a lot of customers think that all retail employees act and behave the same way , which isn t true at all . i can t tell you how many times i ve been verbally harassed simply because i worked in retail , as if i was a lesser human being because of my occupation and i wasn t entitled to the same rights and freedoms . some people who don t understand what it s like to work retail inevitably take unfair advantage of retail workers .","309532":"we met in middle school because we had the same lunch period and both shared a love for linkin park . speaking of best friend she just offered to allow me to move in with her if things get too heated at my house which it has been lately and i m seriously considering it temporarily .","309533":"no . i was frequently absent due to mental illness although at the time , i just blamed it on stress because i didn t want anyone knowing about my struggles .","309534":"it depends on a variety of factors however , mostly , if you re looking for a significant other simply to use them to buy things for you , then yeah that s wrong . if you re looking for someone who s financially stable and can help with the family , bills , etc . , then i don t think that s wrong at all .","309535":"no , not necessarily . intelligence goes behind the scope of traditional education . my boyfriend is intelligent , but he isn t defined by his degree nor am i .","309536":"both are equally as important to me . i wouldn t be able to be with someone who didn t have a similar sense of humor as me , or wasn t able to make me laugh or smile with their jokes . at the same time , intelligence is important to me as well because i require a person with whom i can talk about serious matters and have other intelligent conversations .","309537":"i was born on a monday morning .","309538":"no . i don t believe in god or the devil , nor heaven or hell .","309539":"open world rpgs , mostly . my favorite games are the assassin s creed series , the bioshock series , the halo series , destiny and , fallout and , the elder scrolls skyrim , minecraft , tomb raider , life is strange , and the wolf among us .","309540":"i felt mentally and physically older than i actually was when i was a teenager . i went through a lot of events that forced me to grow up from an early age , so i didn t have time or opportunity to really enjoy a normal childhood or time as a teenager .","309541":"i ve never posted a photo of my body on askfm , so this is a blatant lie . i m medically overweight because i have a high bmi , so there s really no getting around that . regardless , i m unhappy with myself and i want to make some changes . it doesn t matter what other people think of me , only what i think of myself .","309542":"health care i . e . er visits , co pays , etc , and college tuition . people shouldn t be afraid to go to the hospital when they re feeling sick or having a medical emergency because they re terrified of the cost of health care . people shouldn t live without their medication because they can t afford it , especially medication required to survive i . e . insulin . in addition , getting a standard education shouldn t put people in thousands of dollars of debt every year to the point where it takes them years to pay off their student loans . it s a backwards system and so many people are going uneducated because they simply cannot afford college .","309543":"i ve hated someone because they ruined my life , but the act of hating them didn t actually ruin my life , no .","309544":"hell yeah , road trip ! ! that s my dream one day","309545":"i would realistically be in prison regardless of whether being stupid was a crime or not . i ve done some fucked up shit in my life that i can t come back from .","309546":"no , it s mental illness that makes me feel sad . i have clinical depression and a personality disorder , so i usually develop depression in waves as a result .","309547":"i support polyamorous relationships however , i would never participate in one myself because i wouldn t like sharing my boyfriend with anyone and would feel uncomfortable if he had another person on the side .","309548":"oh god i know

tea addict , i smoke cigarettes , i drink beer and wine , and i love getting tattoos i currently have seven . i m an introvert with mental illness , so i prefer alone time or being with a small group of people in a private setting . one of my favorite activities is having a fire with friends and having good conversation .","309554":"talking to myself linkin park https youtu . be jichpjrluzk","309555":"for the most part , i disagree with self diagnosis , especially when it comes to complex disorder such as personality disorders , dissociative disorders , and psychotic disorders . a lay person is not going to know better than a medical doctor , and if someone truly thinks they have a mental illness , they should seek out a professional diagnosis , if they can . if they can t obtain professional help , then they realistically shouldn t diagnose themselves because it often becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and they could infiltrate communities of people who legitimately struggle with these disorders .","309556":"with an americano and a cigarette .","309557":"it s possibly but tbh i m afraid for his impeachment because the lineup of successors after him

rarely . thank you , though .","309561":"i m against the death penalty . i think it s a barbaric means of justice and it doesn t teach the criminal a lesson regarding their behavior it s essentially the easy way out . it s an antiquated means of punishment . in addition , it s more expensive to keep an inmate on death row and execute them than it is to keep them in prison .","309562":"i m anti circumcision . it s a cosmetic procedure that has no medical benefit whatsoever , and it can actually be harmful to the child . in addition , children can t consent to activity that involves their body . if someone wants to cosmetically change their body , they should be old enough to where they understand the pros and cons of such procedures .","309563":"i m pro choice and believe that people should be given the option of abortion , regardless of circumstance . to prevent someone from having an abortion is an invasion of that person s bodily autonomy .","309564":"yes , i was .","309565":"i

extremely particular about where she wants each decoration and it drives me and my father up the wall she s disabled so she can t do it herself .","309569":"practice , practice , practice . you won t get good at writing if you don t write consistently on a daily basis . even if you don t like what you re writing , it s a valuable learning opportunity and you end up teaching yourself your own skills . eventually you develop your own voice .","309570":"people have accused me of being single , or rather that my boyfriend doesn t exist , because i don t talk about our relationship often and i don t post photos of him online . it s amusing , tbh . random onlookers always think they know our lives better than we do , and the fact that they care enough to begin with to make accusations is alarming .","309571":"physically prepared , not at all . i don t own anything to help with a medical emergency , even though i should . mentally , i have a tendency to keep calm during emergencies because i don t want to add to the other person s alarm .","309572":"i ve attended an ugly sweater party and participated , but i didn t win , unfortunately . however , the winner totally deserved it she glued cones to the chest portion of the shirt and rigged it with christmas lights .","309573":"graduating from college with honors most people think it s ordinary and expected for others to graduate from college because a bachelor s degree doesn t mean much anymore , but i was exceptionally proud of myself because i was dealing with mental illness at the time , as well as other stressors , and i didn t think i would be able to handle the courseload .","309574":"no in the past when i was to , i would say yes because i was cold hearted and manipulative , but these days , i know better than to ruin a person s life . i m still paying the price for the mistakes i made in my past , but i wouldn t dream of doing the same thing now .","309575":"i don t do anything to keep fit because i don t exercise at all . the only thing i do to maintain my health is eat nutricious food , although i do have junk food from time to time .","309576":"this is ridiculously adorable thank you so much ! ! it s anons like you who keep me coming back to askfm .","309577":"unless your mind consciously blocked out those memories due to trauma otherwise , no .","309578":"some psychiatrists are so misinformed that its ridiculous and the sad part is that it only adds to the stigma , as if bpd doesn t have enough stigma to begin with .","309579":"i m not interested in your answers , so i won t be following you .","309580":"it isn t my money , so i couldn t care less about how people spend their money . if i had that type of money to blow , however , i d likely spend it on vacations and tattoos instead of meaningless items on an app .","309581":"i accidentally combined soy milk with skim milk while making my coffee last week at work i accidentally grabbed the wrong carton because i wasn t looking . it tasted terrible . do not recommend . i was so disappointed in myself and i was angry the rest of the morning , lmao .","309582":"this is the background i use on my phone .","309583":"yes , definitely men are conditioned into thinking that they should suppress their emotions because it wouldn t be manly to express them , especially feelings like love and sadness . it s something that needs to change in society , especially with respect to mental health . men who have mental illness are less likely to seek out treatment because of the stigma , and in turn , there are higher rates of svicide among men than there are among women .","309584":"i understand this completely i have a tendency to self isolate when i m depressed , which in turn only makes me more depressed because i feel guilty for trying to talk to someone about my feelings , knowing i pushed them away beforehand . i would make it clear to your friends that you don t intend to be distant , but it s a symptom of your depression and during those times , you require them to be pushy and try to talk you through your episode regardless .","309585":"it wouldn t really be a road trip per say because we would go overseas , but i d scoop up courrtana so that we could visit our friend steph in australia ! !","309586":"i have a window in my bathroom that s next to the shower it s nice because you get fresh air while you re doing your business . it isn t a deal breaker for me , though . i ll be happy to find a place in general , haha .","309587":"i only add people who i ve spoken to extensively from askfm on facebook i have a handful of askfm friends added to my facebook account because i trust them with my personal information . other than that , i don t add random people . i m too paranoid that someone is going to stalk or harrass me . i don t need everyone knowing my full name , where i work , my friends , etc .","309588":"i don t care about cars . as long as it runs well and doesn t waste gas , then i m fine with it . i got into a fender bender this morning , and i m pissed because i wasn t there to see it happen so now i m afraid of how much money it ll cost out of pocket to fix my car . i hate people .","309589":"i d absolutely love to visit australia and new zealand they both seem like beautiful countries , and i would also like to visit my friends who currently live in australia , as well .","309590":"i believe witches are real people , but obviously not in the dramatic hollywood esque way that people portray witches to be . correct me if i m wrong but i believe practitioners of wicca the religion are called witches .","309591":"i personally wouldn t feel bad in that situation while i m much closer to my boyfriend s family than i am to my own family , we do still have certain boundaries and it doesn t require us talking every time something miniscule happens , like getting sick . if i was in the hospital for something and they didn t at least text me to see how i was doing , then perhaps i would be mildly upset but that s the only scenario i can think of .","309592":"when i m mentally , physically , and financially prepared to do so , i want to have a little family that i can call my own . i want to make something meaningful out of my life , and i want to be able to raise a family in ways that were completely different from the way i was raised .","309593":"newborns can t understand complex language and don t have the ability to recall information at such young of an age . so realistically , it wouldn t matter what i can hypothetically tell a newborn one day because they won t remember it by the time they re older .","309594":"i don t talk to my family about my personal problems , and i don t have friends who would disregard my feelings like that so unfortunately , i can t relate to this situation . every one of my old friends who has treated me with such disdain or apathy usually weren t my friends anymore after that . i don t have room in my life for people who simply refuse to understand my feelings or refuse to care .","309595":"this sounds like a question for an exterminator , not some random person on askfm .","309596":"i just bought a hoodie from target the other day which says first i drink the coffee , then i do the things . it s so cozy and warm i m actually wearing it in my profile picture , haha .","309597":"abandonment .","309598":"because i m a basic white bitch , i really like the holiday spice flat white from starbucks . i also enjoy gingerbread and pumpkin bread .","309599":"i told my boyfriend about how down i ve been feeling lately so he came home with my favorite kind of ice cream to bring some cheer to my day .","309600":"i could never choose just one game . however , a few of my favorites include destiny and , skyrim , fallout and , bioshock and bioshock infinite , the assassins creed series , and the halo series .","309601":"i m obsessed with guacamole and hummus . i m years old . i like watching true crime documentaries . i graduated college in . i have seven tattoos . i m a writer editor as my profession . i smoke cigarettes . i like red wine more than white wine . i drink at least two cups of coffee per day . i m obsessed with video games .","309602":"thank you ! ! i m definitely not a genius , though , haha .","309603":"i m never really in situations where i can make friends because i don t go to school or anything , and i m too busy at work doing my job to interact with other people . however , i m usually quite guarded when meeting people for the first time because i simply don t know the kind of person they are , and it takes a while for me to warm up to others due to a lack of trust .","309604":"this is contradictory to my answer regarding your question , as well as the answers to the same question you asked other people . you re incredibly young and don t argue with me on that , is very young . focus on bettering yourself and progressing forward with your life , and the rest will fall into place .","309605":"the only ways depression has affected my appearance is when i ve been too depressed to keep up with hygiene i . e . greasy hair , breaking out into pimples , having bo , etc . it s the days where i can t drag myself out of bed so my physical appearance falls apart .","309606":"disclaimer this website is for questions , not conversations . if you have a question for me , feel free to ask .","309607":"ahh , thank you ! !","309608":"this is the most recent photo of me it s from yesterday .","309609":". . . that s a bit extreme .","309610":"i m introverted by nature sometimes it would be nice to be extroverted , because then on days where i have a lot of social interaction , i won t feel run down and numb by the end of the day . being introverted means for me that social interaction physically drains me . i usually go by the book , although sometimes i do bend the rules to my favor as long as it doesn t put me in a risky situation .","309611":"my entire persona is built from negative self image , unfortunately . i m constantly doubting my potential , putting down my accomplishments , criticizing my appearance and weaknesses , and telling myself that i m selfish and cold hearted . despite that , i still strive to become a better person than who i was in the past . because i have these negative thought patterns , it motivates me to do better .","309612":"as long as it s consensual , i see nothing wrong with it . if both partners agree to having a third party enter their relationship and it works out well for them all , then what s the problem ? obviously if a person is dating someone on the side and doesn t tell their significant other , that s a huge problem . but consent is important and there s nothing wrong with polyamorous relationships .","309613":"i don t even know how to approach this statement because of how heated you are right now , so i suggest you take a walk before you come back to this conversation . in any event , me saying that someone pushing an unwanted fetish onto someone else is violating doesn t , in fact , take away from the experiences of people who have also faced the same types of volatile behavior considering i m one of them tbh . after all , a person who makes threats and refuses to listen to someone when they say no is more likely to become a predator , if they aren t one already .","309614":"you re evidently unaware of the plethora of other questions this person has sent related to their fetish of choice . in any event , this entire anon message is dramatic as fuck so you re not doing yourself any favors by complaining about my word choices , lol .","309615":"thank you i just get so angry over certain things , and the past two days have been somewhat of a breaking point to me and i don t know how to handle it anymore . i get such intense urges to either be reckless and stupid or drink myself into a coma whenever it happens . it ll pass hopefully but for now i m still seething and i m going to try to sleep on it because anything else i do would only hurt myself .","309616":"no , and it isn t something i m ever interested in getting . all further questions from you will be deleted . obviously explaining to you why your behavior is wrong didn t work , so i suppose i ll just have to block and report from now on .","309617":"i guess some people never learn , even if the truth is smacking them in the face .","309618":"no , and it s wrong for you to assume such about any person in general , not just me . of people on this website are not comfortable with such interactions pertaining to unwanted fetishes , so my advice to you is to keep your inclinations to yourself .","309619":"i ve never posted photos of the bottom half of my body , let alone my feet , so for all you guys know , i could suffer from chronic foot infections and deformities . regardless imposing your fetishes onto a stranger like this is extremely violating and disgusting .","309620":"they were , and sometimes still are , extremely critical i grew up in an abusive environment , so their unhappiness was often taken out on me or i was blamed for what went wrong . as i ve gotten older , i was conditioned into thinking that things were seemingly my fault by nature , and in turn , i ve never been happy with myself .","309621":"i wouldn t want to pick favorites because that would be unfair to the other people i follow i enjoy everyone s answers , which is why i follow the people whom i do follow . i m also closer to some people as opposed to others , and i wouldn t want other people to feel as if i favor my friends over those whom i m not as friendly with , if that makes sense .","309622":"i never believed i had much influence over other people , simply because i m a nobody . however , i m aware that i have a strong presence on some forms of social media askfm , being the biggest so i try to do my best to portray myself in an acceptable light and not glamorize the unhealthy things i ve done to myself .","309623":"these foot fetish questions in my inbox need to stop .","309624":"awesome ! ! i m doing well i got a new job which i enjoy more than my last job , it s a lot less stressful . there really hasn t been much going on with my life besides that , lol . how are you , friend ?","309625":"lol , trust me the night is young . i ve already had three glasses of wine and it isn t even dessert time yet , plus the family is playing a game later . we also have peach vodka , which is my jam , so i may have a little bit of that too . ?","309626":"this joke wasn t even funny . effort .","309627":"it s perfectly acceptable and it is ok to do so just because you have a fragile sense of masculinity doesn t mean you can impose your vulnerabilities onto other people s lives .","309628":"if this was true , then we wouldn t have complex emotions such as love , hate , anger , passion , sadness , etc etc . we re more than just sexual beings , and there s a whole realm of existence besides merely sex .","309629":"absolutely people are capable of moving on from past lives given the right amount of time and experience in life . i ve moved on from my exes , as have most of my friends from their exes . we have the capability to allow love to dissipate and make room for other people in our heart .","309630":"i ve never encountered such a scenario i avoid misogynistic men like the plague . i don t doubt that this exists , though people in general tend to be hypocrites and only think about themselves .","309631":"no , i would personally become too depressed to function if i chose to stay home instead of work assuming you mean if i didn t develop a disability . working provides structure to my day and gives me a sense of accomplishment .","309632":"this question doesn t make any sense . if a person doesn t want to be pregnant and they subsequently get an abortion , they re not a parent and thus can t be called a deadbeat . if that person does have a child and doesn t want to be in that child s life despite having rights over that child , and further doesn t do anything to make themselves a better person , then i think they deserve that title of being a deadbeat regardless of their gender .","309633":"i have an open mind to it i believe in spirits and such , and i have a few friends who are physics who do believe in it . i just don t think it s to such an extreme as movies portray it to be .","309634":"i d inform him that it s my decision to make because it s my body , and even though he may want a child now , i don t feel capable of handling a child at this point in my life . realistically , he understands this and supports my decision whatever i decide to do if this situation arose .","309635":"i m doing fine not too great but not bad either . i was discussing with my therapist last night about how i feel like i m just coasting through my life because nothing significant has happened in a while , and admittedly my job is a bit boring . i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that there s nothing for me to look forward to .","309636":"i d obviously feel angry at my friend because he s spreading false information about me , especially something on such a personal level . if i were you , i d confront him head on it s the only way to resolve the situation , even though it might be difficult . they need to know that what they re doing is wrong and a violation of your privacy .","309637":"it s amazing that people would rather risk dealing with the often inaccurate responses of other people rather than doing their own homework .","309638":"i overthink things all of the time the downfalls of having mental illnesses . most of the day consists of me thinking critically , and sometimes my mind wanders and makes up a lot of what if scenarios .","309639":"one of my first few dates with my boyfriend included going to the beach it was during the middle of the week so it was fairly quiet , and we spent the time talking and listening to music . there was also a food bar on the beach , so we were able to eat as well .","309640":"i m fairly good at remembering passwords , but sometimes it takes me a few tries because i have different variations of passwords depending on the site i use .","309641":"i met the members of linkin park back in during one of their concerts . they were the nicest group of people i ever met , and i m so grateful that i met them because of the profound influence they ve had on my life .","309642":"aside from the obvious answer of money , i believe it s how happy a person is with their life and the type of support system they have to help them deal with life s stressors .","309643":"money is one of the most important aspects of my life , so paying me in money would be best i need to pay my bills , pay for doctor visits and medication , etc etc .","309644":"she bought me a soy candle , an organic lip scrub , and a bath bomb . they re all from a local business that makes all natural bath products . my boyfriend bought me a bottle of disaronno , my cousin bought me a starbucks gift card , my brother bought me some snacks to take to work , and my parents bought me a leather jacket with a hoodie sewn inside for the winter .","309645":"the gifts my best friend bought me for my birthday ! !","309646":"there s nothing really to do because there s simply no room for her anyway it s only a one bedroom , and that s reserved for you and your husband . even though she would like to move in , she realistically can t .","309647":"everyone is coming over my house tonight and all i want to do is be left alone .","309648":"my weekend has been good so far ! ! i left work early on friday so that my boyfriend and i had time to drive to the motel we were staying in to check in . we met up with his family that evening and went to a wine tasting event at an aquarium , and it was so much fun a lot of delicious wine , a variety of huge fish , and live music ! ! we spent the night in the motel , grabbed breakfast with the family , and then headed home . i got home around pm yesterday and spent the afternoon relaxing , napping , drinking tea , etc . at night , i went to my best friend s house and we hung out for a few hours . today , i m not planning on doing much . i m going to relax all afternoon and then some family and my boyfriend are coming over for dinner to celebrate my birthday .","309649":"at the moment , all i want is to be able to light a candle in peace without someone yelling at me to put it out . i absolutely love candles , but my mother absolutely hates them and tells me to put them out every time i light one . they relax and calm me so much , but i can t even light one without confrontation .","309650":"thank you , isole ! ! ?","309651":"thank you so much ! ! my day has been great my boyfriend and i just got home , and i desperately need a nap to recover from last night , lmao .","309652":"my boyfriend and his family treated me to a wine tasting event that was held at a local aquarium last night you basically walked around and looked at the exhibits and there were wine tasting stations everywhere . it was so much fun ! ! my best friend also bought me a yummy smelling soy candle , organic lip scrub , and a bath bomb from a local business . the business was started by a friend of ours and she sells all organic bath scrubs , candles , soaps , etc .","309653":"thank you ! !","309654":"i m at a wine tasting event at an aquarium for my birthday , and i m so happy","309655":"take my medication when i wake up in the morning . i always forget , so i usually carry extra medication with me wherever i go so that i don t skip doses .","309656":"the only thing that bothers me is that people waste time going anonymous just to send out hate to other users in an attempt to make them feel bad about themselves . it s the ultimate form of cowardice .","309657":"it s difficult enough maintaining my own life , let alone a completely different life alongside my own . i wouldn t have the mental capacity to keep up with it all . and i honestly have no desire to do such a thing anyway .","309658":"aw , this is so sweet . thank you so much ! !","309659":"no , i ve never been arrested . i probably should have been arrested in the past due to all of the stupid shit i did , but i got lucky .","309660":"i honestly think they re a good idea . there are so many people with ptsd and sensory problems who react badly to conventional fireworks due to the loud noises , and silent fireworks are a safer alternative while still being aesthetically pleasing .","309661":"i was nervous this morning because i wrote my first press release and e mailed it to my editor for review , and he said it was actually very impressive !","309662":"thank you i don t think i ll ever be well , but it s a work in progress . i struggle with chronic depression , anxiety , panic disorder , and a personality disorder , so there will always be something since they re ingrained in me . i m currently in treatment now , though , and i ve made progress over the past year .","309663":"i m not in college anymore i graduated in . however , my degree is in professional writing with a minor in english literature .","309664":"will leigh ever stop using snapchat filters ? stay tuned","309665":"hot coffee first thing in the morning .","309666":"abandonment particularly , from my boyfriend and best friend . i m constantly paranoid that my friendships and relationships are a lie .","309667":"i m not comfortable posting my poetry on askfm as i ve stated many times before .","309668":"my candles finally came in the mail and i m so excited to try them ! !","309669":"i am not a serial killer . it s a good movie about a teenager who s suspected to have antisocial personality disorder and works in a morgue with his mother . a serial killer is in town and he s determined to find out how the killer s mind operates , but it isn t what he expected .","309670":"you clearly don t know me if you think i m bigoted . you can kindly take me off of your spam list now , since i m sure you re sending just as much hate to other random accounts .","309671":"that s what i ll most likely end up doing , until i can afford some decent bookshelves to display them all .","309672":"born and raised in new york .","309673":"tbh i m such a book hoarder that i wouldn t want to get rid of them at all it s the only thing i obsessively hoard besides coffee mugs .","309674":"you re not a loser for graduating college after your friends have the fact that you re graduating should give you a sense of pride since it s an amazing accomplishment ! ! besides , there s no such thing as being too old for college . when i was in school , half of my classes were made up of older students over the age of . it s never too late to seek an education .","309675":"yes , i do ! ! i don t know what i m going to do with them all when i move out , haha .","309676":"i ve been trying not to eat meat products lately , i don t enjoy them anymore .","309677":"no , that s abnormal . mental illness is a debilitating disease for many people , and it shouldn t be glamorized let alone sexualized .","309678":"i always wish i had more money , haha . i would put it towards an apartment for my boyfriend and i , as well as towards my loans and bills .","309679":"it doesn t upset me at all because i know it s not their fault my father earns a lot of money from his job , but my mother is disabled , so a lot of money goes towards her medical bills and medication . regardless , that doesn t affect my financial situation at all because i make my own money independent from my parents . i haven t taken money from my parents since i was a teenager .","309680":"pumpkin pie , without a doubt however , i prefer cheesecake most of all ! !","309681":"according to astrophysicists , it s made up of dark energy , dark matter , and normal matter .","309682":"i ve never used an iphone , since i ve had androids since i was a teenager i just upgraded my phone last year , so i m not due for another upgrade anytime soon .","309683":"twice everything else was just an infatuation .","309684":"my boyfriend knows me the best because of my self identity issues , he probably knows me better than i know myself . we re open about everything together , and often he can predict my mood swings before they happen because he recognizes the patterns within me .","309685":"thankfully , no ! ! we were supposed to get flurries yesterday , but it was too warm outside and it turned into rain instead .","309686":"i currently have questions in my inbox well , it ll be questions after i publish this answer , haha .","309687":"i ve been in bed for two days straight and i m trying to convince myself that i m not depressed .","309688":"positive i got a higher paying , less stressful job . negative my mental health continues to deteriorate despite my circumstances getting better and being on the max dose of my medication .","309689":"right now , my aim is to currently gain back control of my mental health and save up enough money to afford an apartment with my boyfriend .","309690":"abandonment is my primary fear my loved ones leaving me . i often take extreme measures to ensure that they don t and i need constant reassurance .","309691":"google news they list major stories in various categories , such as trending news , politics , science , health , etc . i like it because it comes from a variety of sources so that you can read about the same event from multiple forms of media and develop an unbiased opinion .","309692":"i m very clingy , lol . i m fairly insecure and need constant reassurance , which can sometimes result in clingy behavior . however , i dislike when people tend to cling onto me because i need a lot of personal space and i don t have the mental capacity to deal with a person who s clingy on top of my own slew of issues .","309693":"without a doubt the love i have for my boyfriend isn t superficial and he s my best friend on top of being my partner . i would be thrilled to call him my husband regardless of his disabilities .","309694":"i ve always preferred working individually as opposed to in a group especially if my name is on the line or if i m being graded on it . i don t trust other people , so it s frightening to me how i don t have full control over the assignment , not knowing if the result is going to be up to par . not everyone wants to put in the same effort as i do , so i d rather work alone where i know things will be done to my liking and guarantee a good outcome .","309695":"i used to write poetry all the time , but i haven t written any in quite a few years .","309696":"how about a photo of my face instead","309697":"i think so your tattoos or piercings or hair don t define you as an individual or as a worker , and that stereotype is archaic . the only exception to that , in my opinion , are tattoos that are offensive or show nudity . if so , they should be censored accordingly .","309698":"i don t go on anon to ask questions , mostly because if i have a question to ask someone it isn t inappropriate and i m comfortable being myself . anon trolls are cowardly and immature , though . they re too afraid to come off anon to even justify their opinions and it gives them a false sense of power . anyone who bullies someone else , especially over the internet , has a lot of unresolved anger and personal issues , and no amount of bullying will solve their problems .","309699":"i ll probably take my boyfriend s last name because i don t like my family and i don t want to be associated with them when i move on in my life .","309700":"i don t even know what this word means .","309701":"it s definitely a great idea , but albeit unrealistic . most people are barely able to invest money into a savings account , let alone invest an entire year s pay by the time they re years old . and it has nothing to do with responsibility either . a lot of people are overworked and underpaid and only make enough money to either live paycheck to paycheck or remain comfortable .","309702":"it wasn t necessarily a fashion trend because it wasn t popular , but when i was a teen , i constantly wore fishnet shirts and tripp pants . i m not embarrassed of it or anything , but i probably looked ridiculous and as if i was trying too hard to be alternative .","309703":"in a general sense , no . the opinions of the general population don t matter much to me at all you can t please everyone . however , the opinions of my loved ones matter to me a lot . they re the only people whose opinions i take into consideration .","309704":"lol . obviously my personality needs work i literally have a personality disorder .","309705":"lol oh my god . these kids must be young as hell . that s terrifying . they ll be our age before they know it and realize that being in your s isn t old at all , lol .","309706":"aw , this is super sweet . thank you","309707":"i m honestly afraid to ask how old you are , considering you think is old . are you even old enough to be using askfm to begin with ?","309708":"there s no such policy as being too old for social media so no . besides , i know plenty of askfm users who are older than me , so it s not as if my age is an important factor regarding my use of this site .","309709":"why would i lie about my age ? yes , i m turning this month .","309710":"i have a hard and diligent work ethic , i m extremely loyal to my friends , and i m compassionate .","309711":"this is a stupid and pointless question .","309712":"tbh , ever since i turned , i ve just been going to the bar for my birthday because it s simple lol . however , i m excited for my birthday next week because i m going to a wine tasting event that s happening inside of an aquarium . you get to walk around and drink wine and listen to music and see giant fish and sharks , so it should be a lot of fun .","309713":"my job is an hour away from my house and i only started my job two weeks ago , so yes i need my gps at the moment .","309714":"poetalunam literally , i still need to use the gps sometimes to find my way to work .","309715":"i won a game of monopoly against my boyfriend a few years ago , and he was angry because it was the first time i ever played and i beat him , lmfao .","309716":"i m so proud of the election results today .","309717":"not anymore , no . i used to lie to myself about needing professional help regarding my mental illnesses when i was younger because i didn t want to admit to myself that they were as bad as they were . i assumed that because i could go to school , i wasn t deserving of any help . when i got older and my illnesses were more out of hand , that s when i realized i needed help it ll be two years ago in january . i was going to end my life and that made me realize that i hit rock bottom and decided to see a doctor instead .","309718":"when you re living with yourself , you re comfortable with who you are as an individual and are free to express your feelings and emotions because you have the confidence to do so .","309719":"i m not as depressed as i used to be which is thanks in part to the medication i take and intensive therapy . i m not immature anymore , although i was mature for my age when i was a teenager . i was more immune to being manipulated and i looked at situations in an immature manner . i don t sh anymore , which was a big aspect of my life when i was a teenager . i still have the scars from it , but i used to walk around in a constant state of paranoia due to open wounds .","309720":"i m extremely responsible , and i usually take care of chores without being asked to do so . i have a lot of responsibilities at home because my mother is disabled , so my father and i do all of the cleaning around the house , the laundry , the cooking , and the grocery shopping , as well as our own responsibilities that we have for our own needs .","309721":"they re called trans men . not female men .","309722":"obviously they all have a choice too . i m pro choice so i believe everyone has the right to get an abortion because of bodily autonomy . also , please don t call them female men . that s incredibly disrespectful .","309723":"i ve been to traffic court , if that counts for anything . i went to dispute a speeding ticket , considering it was my first offense .","309724":"in most cases , no there isn t a valid reason . in otherwise healthy relationships , there s no reason why you can t sit down with your partner and end the relationship if you re not interested in them anymore or feel the need to pursue someone else . however , that being said , i think the exception is when a person is in an abusive relationship , and the only way to get away from their partner is by seeing someone else or if someone else is a major source of comfort , whatever the reason may be . sometimes it can be dangerous for someone to try to end an abusive relationship without proper help .","309725":"the last show i watched was stranger things , and my favorite character is dustin ! !","309726":"me in anime form","309727":"no . once i m done with a person , i pretty much want nothing to do with them ever again and i hold no emotional connection to them .","309728":"happiness is waking up with your partner by your side and spending the morning drinking coffee outside and having memorable conversations .","309729":"most of the people who identify with feminism on the internet have largely turned the entire movement into a social media trend instead of a progressive movement like it originated to become . as a result , feminism has become somewhat of a joke and isn t taken seriously anymore . i still have feminist ideologies , specifically with respect to intersectional feminism , but i don t adhere to the feminist label anymore due to the antagonizing amount of useless politics behind the label and over the top interpretations . i d rather just have my beliefs as they are instead of being boxed into a label .","309730":"when was the last time you ve been on my page ? i haven t identified as a feminist in over a year , lol .","309731":"i ve had to remove a lot of toxic people from my life over the years because they had negative energies and were pulling me into dark spaces that i knew better than to climb into . i entertained their friendships for a short while , but after i realized that they were detrimental to my mental health , i cut them loose .","309732":"the necklace i m currently wearing that my boyfriend bought me for christmas last year . it s sentimental to me .","309733":"no , i would have too much of a guilty conscience to ever let that happen . i usually take responsibility if i ve done things wrong .","309734":"illegal drugs , shoplifting , vandalizing , things of that nature . most people look at me and think i m some innocent creature , lol .","309735":"my appearance overall , i . e . my face , my weight , my arms , my stomach , etc etc . there s so much i wish i could change , but i ve had absolutely no motivation to do anything about it .","309736":"it s always been a dream of mine to live in the wilderness and off the grid , away from civilization and from people in general . i ve always felt most at home when surrounded by nature , and the stress of living a regular adult life can be too much for me .","309737":"i d rather lose all of the photos i ve ever taken . if i lost all of my money , i wouldn t know what to do to survive i have bills to pay and medical issues that i need to maintain on a daily basis .","309738":"what about my page makes you dickwads think that i would ever comply with such an asinine demand ? gtfo .","309739":"guess what i m doing tonight .","309740":"i grind my teeth in my sleep due to anxiety it irritates the hell out of my boyfriend , so i m going to have to get fitted for a mouth guard soon .","309741":"is it pathetic that i don t remember the last movie i saw in the theatre ? lol . i think it was guardians of the galaxy , but i honestly don t remember . either way , that was a great movie .","309742":"making friendships with people whom you can trust and be yourself around . finding happiness in the little things and small victories .","309743":"i organized and tidied my room , and now it looks so clean and fresh . ?","309744":"pros you re not

myself through schooling despite having severe mental illness at the time .","309747":"the only pet i have at the moment is a catfish named shadow .","309748":"sometimes , i do that . usually it happens after a conversation is already over and i contemplate what i should have said and what they could have said back to me in return .","309749":"you could , at the very least , hear him out he might be genuinely sorry , especially if he realized the wrongs he committed . however , that doesn t mean you have to be his friend . you can explain to him that his words were hurtful , and while you understand his guilt now , you don t want to pursue a friendship with him .","309750":"i can t make that decision for you because i don t know the nature of your friendship with him . do what s best for you in this circumstance if you don t want to forgive him , you shouldn t feel obligated to .","309751":"abandonment .","309752":"i don t think you re acting selfish because you can t help what you feel at this moment . if this isn t the right time for you to have a child , then you have to listen to your instincts and do what you think is best for your current situation .","309753":"lol , i m not getting into that on askfm . my ex can rot for all i care . he isn t a concern in my life anymore .","309754":"compassion support . without the compassion and support of my boyfriend and best friend , i wouldn t be alive today .","309755":"no , i don t think so . i m an adult and i still have a stuffed animal in my bed , haha .","309756":"for one reason or another , your mind blocked out your childhood whether it s due to simple memory loss or for a darker reason in order to protect itself . i ve talked about my memory loss with my therapist , and we can only assume its due to trauma , especially considering i was traumatized during the ages i do remember . but everyone has a different story . if you really want to delve into your missing memories , you could try hypnosis .","309757":"i don t have ocd , so i don t exhibit symptoms of ocd . in addition , ocd is not an adjective it s a mental illness that can be extremely debilitating for some people . regardless , i need to clear all of my notifications from my phone , otherwise it irritates me . i don t necessarily check my notifications right away , but i at least make them disappear so that my screen isn t cluttered .","309758":"my coworker recommended some quest mods for me to download for skyrim , and i m so freaking stoked to try them out tonight . ?","309759":"i don t think it s disrespectful at all it s normal in a healthy relationship to feel comfortable with your partner pleasuring themselves if you re not in the mood or aren t around , and vice versa . if you or your partner aren t interacting with anyone else while engaging in that activity assuming it s a monogamous relationship , then it doesn t constitute as cheating .","309760":"i didn t skip any classes while i was in high school , but i often skipped classes in college . i usually skipped because i wanted to go out with friends or it was because my mental illnesses were forcing me to stay in bed .","309761":"aw , thank you ! ! this is so sweet . i ve been good , though i recently got a new job where i m happier and making more money , so i m furthering myself in my career . in addition , my boyfriend and i are saving up our money to rent an apartment together by next summer . also , i saw my therapist last night and she said i ve hit some major milestones during our treatment together , which made me glad because sometimes it takes an outside perspective to really realize how good or bad you re doing .","309762":"i highly disagree . coming from a perspective where i have my own sh scars , people shouldn t feel ashamed of their scars because they re a part of you like any other part of your body , and they re indicative that you re winning your battle against mental illness because you re still alive . no one would judge a person for having physical scars from a physical illness , so why judge a person for having physical scars from a mental illness ? society should ideally be more understanding of mental illness in general , including the scars we ve garnered through our struggles .","309763":"i m doing fine , thank you for asking i ve recently been extremely busy with work , which is why i haven t been on askfm as often . however , i recently made a work buddy who have me her phone number so i m pretty excited about that . it s always nice to have someone you can talk to at work .","309764":"i m named after a family friend , as far as i m aware . she was apparently a very influential and artistic person .","309765":"most domestic terrorist attacks are

whether a person is complicated based on their gender it s individualized for each person .","309768":"i try to do that on a regular basis to show my love and appreciation for people i always want others to know that i care about their friendship and that i wouldn t be as good of a person as i am without their support .","309769":"this isn t something i ve ever considered before . i ll be happy if i can find an affordable apartment with a basic kitchen dining area , bedroom , bathroom , central air and heat , and a washer dryer . i also want a place that allows pets , but that s so hard to find these days .","309770":"you ve put me in a difficult predicament , friend . i follow people because i can t dwindle my list down any lower than that because those people s answers are the ones i like the most , including yours ! ! however , if i had to choose courrtana lakocis my name isnt eric shehitsback youcuntx","309771":"disloyalty , lying , cheating , manipulative behavior , lack of support , lack of compassion , abvse , etc etc .","309772":"it s all good we all have our own crew of anons who are too afraid to come forward with their identities just for attention s sake . the best thing you can do in these circumstances is ignore it . those who know you will know better than to listen to them .","309773":"lol . regardless , let s please stop spamming my page with this nonsense . this doesn t affect my life whatsoever .","309774":"no , but you can certainly get the fuck out of my inbox with your fetishes . i have no tolerance for this , and you guys should get the hint by now .","309775":"that s actually an incredibly high gpa ! ! you should be very proud of yourself .","309776":"if isn t in your budget , you should talk to your brother and inform him that you don t have that kind of money on you if he s understanding , i m sure he won t mind because overall it s the thought that counts , not the number associated with the item s .","309777":"they continued loving me and showed me extra support during a time when i didn t think i was capable of being loved . my mental illnesses were at their worst point , but instead of giving up on me , they worked harder to understand and support me so that i knew i wasn t alone .","309778":"cont . . . and i feel like i m wasting her time because i feel happier than i did . i still feel a bit down quite a bit , and the guilt is killing me . some advice would be appreciated . thank you so much . sorry it took me so long to respond to you ! ! however , your feelings are valid and you shouldn t feel guilty at all even though you re happier now , your depression was still very real and obviously severe . i suggest that you continue going to therapy because it s evidently helping , and you may fall back into a depression if you decided to stop maybe , but the risk is always there . either way , i m proud of you for telling me this and again , you have no reason to feel bad or guilty . depression comes and goes in waves , and i m happy that you re experiencing an upswing .","309779":"not at all i m fairly open in real life in regards to sex , and it s usually a topic of conversation among myself and my friends , lol .","309780":"i m shopping for desk decor on amazon , and i want everything on there ! ! i can t decide on what i want , so does anyone have any suggestions as to what to buy to make my desk look cute and organized ?","309781":"it depends entirely on the individual . some people are comfortable talking about those subjects with others , while other people may be a bit more sensitive . if you re in such a situation , you should ask your friend first before delving into such a conversation .","309782":"plenty of times , sure . i think everyone has experienced loneliness to some degree at least once in their lives .","309783":"no ? it s just a skull and it s a snapchat filter , lol . if it was a sugar skull , that would be a different story .","309784":"my family test runs the snow blower to make sure it s still working , and we buy salt for the walkway and driveway . i just bought new wipers and headlights for my car , and i m planning on spending part of my next paycheck on snow tires . i know of plenty of safety risks associated with the snow winter . unfortunately , my area gets a lot of snow but plows don t come through as often as they should , which leads to a lot of roads being icy and where you can t see pavement . winter is my least favorite season , driving wise .","309785":"one good thing attending my best friend s wedding ! ! one bad thing my depression has been creeping back in and making it difficult for me to do ordinary activities . one strange thing starting a new job . it s strange to me because i m not used to the total change of routine and i ll need some time to adjust .","309786":"probably a home depot or costco , one of those warehouse stores that basically has everything .","309787":"neither i m a realist more than anything else . i try not to look on the bad side of the spectrum , but i m also not an optimistic person either . i like to look at the reality of situations so that there are no false expectations .","309788":"since you re anonymous and are making false assumptions , you probably are an insecure human being with nothing better to do than spend your time involved in other people s lives .","309789":"i don t necessarily celebrate the religious meaning of christmas . i buy gifts for my family because it s a commercialized holiday and it s expected to purchase gifts for people

big promotion at work , we ll be able to afford our own apartment by next year .","309793":"my day has been good thus far . i stayed over my boyfriend s house last night through this morning . we honestly slept most of the time because we ve both been so exhausted from work . i got home not too long ago and have been relaxing by drinking coffee and watching the storm outside .","309794":"i have a lot of favorite movies the lord of the rings trilogy , the shining , the number , queen of the damned , les miserables , we need to talk about kevin , i am not a serial killer , american psycho , the craft , heathers , fear and loathing in las vegas , secret window , the crow , the punisher , etc .","309795":"i m not a big sports person , tbh . sometimes i ll watch ice hockey because it s my boyfriend s favorite sport , but i never watch sports on my own time .","309796":"lol , for that period of time in my life , i was . however , it was also a dark time during my life because it was when my mental illnesses were at their worst and the only way i dealt with my emotions were with drugs and alcohol . i obviously don t recommend it because it s incredibly bad for you and can only make your problems worse , because you re masking them instead of dealing with them head on .","309797":"i welcome most questions however , i always delete questions pertaining to my trauma , my family , and anything that s sexual . i m not comfortable talking about any of those topics .","309798":"lol , yes . my store manager for my first job was an absolute nightmare . everyone walked on eggshells around him because he was quick to anger , overreacted to small and insignificant things , and was just an unpleasant person to be around . i d often come home from work in tears because of his behavior and would be afraid to go back into work the next day .","309799":"no , but my boyfriend is an expert at opening beer bottles with regular household items if we can t find our bottle opener , haha .","309800":"i ve been in a relationship for eight years , so . . . ?","309801":"why would such a life be wasted if that s truly what that person wanted ? judging other people for their life choices especially their decision to have children is immature . instead of focusing on other people s lives , you should instead focus on bettering your own life . you ll find a lot more joy out of life once you realize that other people s lives aren t any of your business .","309802":"i m feeling well tbh i m surprised at how well i m feeling right now considering how stressed out i was to go back to work today ! ! i m enthusiastic , though there s a starbucks in the same building as my office and i get an hour lunch break , as well as two minute paid breaks , so it feels like this job is taking care of me .","309803":"thank you ! ! my first day went really well it was a lot of information to take in at once and the commute was hell mins both ways , but the guy who trained me said i was doing a good job considering it was only my first day ! ! ?","309804":"this is the only photo i took tonight lol .","309805":"i just finished up with the rehearsal dinner for my best friend s wedding , and now i m having a fire with my boyfriend and his two best friends .","309806":"got my nails done for the wedding","309807":"i use the wine red tone it s one of my favorite colors and somewhat matches the background i chose behind my profile photo .","309808":"i just finished getting my nails done with my best friend and one of her friends in preparation for the wedding tomorrow . later tonight , we have the wedding rehearsal and dinner , and then i m hanging out with my boyfriend and his best friend for the night .","309809":"pay off my bills and student loans , buy a house for my boyfriend and i , buy a house for my best friend and her husband , buy new cars for my boyfriend and best friend , and re vamp my entire wardrobe .","309810":"elevated temperatures .","309811":"my boyfriend makes me happy on a daily basis . i m so grateful to have him in my life .","309812":"ugh i m so in love with my hair","309813":"i don t do well with subtle cues , so i ve always preferred when people told me flat out whether or not they wanted to date me . however , it isn t exactly a situation i m familiar with . people rarely expressed their feelings towards me in the past , and my boyfriend was actually one of the few who told me straight away after a lot of conversations , of course that he was interested in dating me .","309814":"book wise , probably the harry potter series . the hunger games trilogy comes in at a close second , though . i also enjoy the vampire chronicles by anne rice . movie wise , the lord of the rings has always been my favorite . i never found a chance to read all of the books although i do own them all , so i can t determine if it would be one of my favorite book series .","309815":"i think it would be interesting if it took place in black marsh , the homeland of the argonians . they ve always been a race that intrigued me , although i ve never played as an argonian .","309816":"i have a lot of favorite movies , haha . lord of the rings , v for vendetta , the crow , the punisher , i am not a serial killer , american psycho , the shining , girl interrupted , queen of the damned , the craft , les miserables , fear and

forest .","309819":"i think it s great that they re advocating for gender identities besides the male female binary . trans people need more representation in the media .","309820":"i don t have any close friends with problematic views anymore , but i do have family members who are close minded , racist . homophobic , etc . unfortunately , you can t choose your family . however , i try to peacefully coexist with them and not bring up the topics i know are sensitive , otherwise it s just a pain in the ass for everyone involved .","309821":"you have to remind yourself that things are in the past , and for that reason , they cannot be changed . there s no productive reason to regret past mistakes because there s nothing you can do to change the outcome of those scenarios . however , what you can do is use that information to make better judgments and shape your own future . learn from your mistakes and use those lessons to make better choices .","309822":"no , i don t . i feel like that s some sort of weird invasion of a person s privacy . it isn t any of my business what someone keeps in their cabinets , so why would i look in the first place ?","309823":"makes a joke about how emo is a style of music and hasn t been around since the early s","309824":"this is the only full body picture i ll ever post because there s a beardie on my booty","309825":"i ve been in a relationship with a man for seven years , two to three of those years we ve lived together .","309826":"i don t expect myself to live past the age of , so i don t ever think of myself as elderly . i ll be dead before that happens to me .","309827":"not usually , no . the only times i ve been offended are if my close friends have said something offensive and i had to explain why what they said was problematic .","309828":"i absolutely love autumn sunsets . i took this photo a few weeks ago .","309829":"this is something you need to resolve with your boyfriend asking people for opinions online won t help because we don t know your boyfriend , and therefore , can t gauge his response . you have to sit down with him and have a conversation about how it makes you feel and see if you can come to a compromise , whether it s more phone calls or setting a time together where you can both talk .","309830":"my name is leigh , and i m years old . i like long walks through cemetaries , watching gore films , chain smoking cigarettes , and drinking red wine . chances are i won t like you , so don t bother trying to be my friend .","309831":"i have a facebook account , but again i don t give that out to anons . its for friends only , there s too much personal information on facebook for me to feel comfortable sharing with anonymous people .","309832":"i m not going to meet any of my anons , so this is a silly hypothetical question .","309833":"this is the problem with society in general sexual advances aren t taken seriously , which makes others think that this type of behavior is okay . non consensual activity is a crime , and if you treat all of the people in your life with such blatant disregard , you re going to find yourself in quite a bit of trouble with the law . however , by the looks of it , it seems as if you deserve some punishment for you to realize exactly what you re proposing .","309834":"probably punch you in the face . i don t react well to unwanted advances , and i will raise hell if anyone is stupid enough to do so .","309835":"i m years old and have been in a relationship for seven years . of course i ve kissed a man , lol .","309836":"thank you i just woke up , so i m feeling all right . i have a hair appointment and therapy today , so at least i have something to take my mind off of things .","309837":"my boyfriend . speaking of which , he made me a bombass omelette this morning . i love this man .","309838":"they whole metoo hashtag that s been trending currently has brought to light the magnitude of sexual harassment and assault in today s world nearly every woman i know has experienced one or the other , and i ve found so much strength in friends and acquaintances who are willing to share their stories . however , nobody is obligated to tell their story and their story isn t owed to anyone at all . if someone is uncomfortable revealing their sexual harassment or assault , then they shouldn t be shamed for remaining quiet . for each person who talks about their experiences , there s likely nine more people who are too afraid to share . the same goes for men as well . men aren t immune from sexual harassment or assault , and often they re shamed for revealing their stories . the stigma that exists around this topic needs to end and something needs to be done to prevent its prevalence .","309839":"they re interchangeable .","309840":"five facts i was born on november th . i have a degree in professional writing . my new job is an editorialist for a publishing company . i m a self proclaimed gamer . my favorite season

year , i was unmedicated , suicidal , unhappy in my job , and lost in my own dark thoughts . i was desperate for connection with anyone who could relate to how i felt , and i thought i was nearing my own end . i felt no pleasure in anything and slept for hours a day . today , i m on the right dose of medication and have been engaged in consistent mental health treatment . i ve learned how to discuss my feelings and reach out when i m feeling down . i m moving forward in my career and in my relationships . although i still have bad days , they re not nearly as bad as how they were a year ago .","309842":"people older than dating someone who s younger than or so . it s predator like behavior , but weirdly accepted in today s society . you have to wonder what s going through the mind of the year old to even be attracted to someone who s and under .","309843":"i used to use credit cards a lot , but i ve recently stopped using them except on rare occasions for things like booking hotels , paying for expensive items , etc . i ve always paid my bills on time .","309844":"i ve never been to an ent before . i ve probably been to one when i was a toddler , but i don t remember .","309845":"absolutely i have plenty of friends who are muslim . i don t judge people based on which religion they ascribe to .","309846":"absolutely . college is a great experience to have , both in a personal and academic sense . you learn a lot about the topics you re studying as well as about yourself . it also teaches a sense of responsibility .","309847":"when i was in school , i loved studying and learning new things . if i could be something akin to a professional student and get paid for studying , then i totally would .","309848":"i m fairly modest , yes . i have a tendency to underestimate my own abilities , even if i ve accomplished something great .","309849":"i haven t had much irl experience with people doing those sorts of things , but i do notice that type of behavior on the internet normal reactions and behaviors being played out as some sort of mental illness . unfortunately , being mentally ill has become some sort of a sick trend , and people are quick to self diagnose typical moods and feelings when they re not actually abnormal . i used to have panic attacks everyday when i was trying to adjust to change that was an aspect of my panic disorder , and now i take medication to prevent that from happening . but feeling regular anxiety over big changes is common and expected it isn t indicative of any disorders .","309850":"i m hesitant to accept change in the beginning , but once the changes have been made , i am quick to adapt . for example , settling into my new job is making me nervous and anxious , but i know that once i get over the first few days , i ll probably be fine .","309851":"persons can be used , but the more common term is people .","309852":"none of my jobs have had scandals , haha .","309853":"a little bit of both , depending on my mood . i like to socialize with small groups of friends , but i can t stay in that environment for very long because it s mentally draining to me . i require my alone time .","309854":"i try not to live with regrets , but sometimes i dwell on the past and think about the mistakes i ve made and how they ve shaped me , for better or for worse . there are some things i ve done which i wish i didn t do , but the only thing i can do about them is move on and think about the present moment .","309855":"wild horses by the rolling stones .","309856":"i m naturally a quiet , inquisitive person so i do have the tendency to notice subtle changes like that specifically , changes in hair style , hair color , etc .","309857":"i m a big fan of puns , memes , and dark humor .","309858":"there s so much stigma surrounding the gay community , and on top of that , men are bombarded with the idea that they should be masculine . complimenting another man is unfortunately seen as something that detracts from their masculinity , so if a man is insecure with their sexuality or the way they present themselves , they might add that no homo modifier . complimenting another person obviously doesn t mean that you re gay , but there s so much hypermasculinity in society that men are forced to think that any recognition of attractive attributes is automatically a gay thought . it isn t .","309859":"i m glad i m not the only one who thinks this way .","309860":"i m not a kid anymore , but i try to be nice wherever i go .","309861":"lol , peace out brother .","309862":"do you think that you were brought into life without anyone s help ? that s forcing a belief upon me . like i ve stated multiple times , i don t care about whatever beliefs a person has because i won t challenge them with my own beliefs . it s a matter of respect .","309863":"not at all . i just don t understand how you don t believe you re disrespecting my beliefs by preaching about things i consistently told you i don t believe in . there s really no point in you attempting to convince me otherwise .","309864":"you re basically saying i m sorry that you re offended instead of owning up to the fact that you re disrespecting my beliefs and attempting to force your own opinions down my throat , lol .","309865":"i disagree . i know plenty of religious people who don t force their beliefs upon others and respect other people for their belief system .","309866":"if you respected my beliefs , you wouldn t say that my opinions were wrong simply because i have a different belief system than you .","309867":"i m saying you re being disrespectful by preaching your beliefs to me , someone who has said that they don t believe in god .","309868":"preaching to a choir means that you re relaying your beliefs to a group of people who have the same belief system as you . that s not inherently wrong . however , preaching to someone who knowingly doesn t have the same beliefs as you is disrespectful . it doesn t matter whether your god preached to his followers or not because that s irrelevent to the conversation .","309869":"i said i didn t believe in god which is a theistic belief . evolution is science .","309870":"it s a matter of respect . i respect your religion , so there s no reason why you can t respect my beliefs . it s a matter of common decency .","309871":"i don t disrespect people who are religious , so please don t disrespect me by preaching your ideas and claiming that my beliefs are wrong . i have plenty of friends who are religious and i respect them . you should do the same to those who aren t religious .","309872":"oh my god , is this for real .","309873":"exactly . i don t follow a religion , and i don t believe in god .","309874":"i m an athiest , so i don t believe in any supreme gods ."}}
