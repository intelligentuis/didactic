. there s no such thing as human privilege . that s invalidating to those in disadvantaged groups who do experience oppression .","286823":"uh , what does mental health have to do with my writing abilities ? lmaoo . you don t need to be mentally healthy in order to articulate yourself well . that s ableist .","286824":"this past weekend particularly on saturday . i spent the day indoors , slept in super late , played video games , and went out with a few friends at night .","286825":"there are a lot of variables that would factor into this , so i don t have a concrete answer . my entire persona would be different , so who knows what sort of person i would be if i was male .","286826":"based solely on their sex , no . people who are male experience male privilege .","286827":"no , the work related things i do at home my freelance work are paid work assignments .","286828":"no , although i know that i should .","286829":"well , i have unhealthy attachments for the most part . i become overly attached to certain people in my life , and they re obviously the most important things in my life to me .","286830":"i don t know many people to that extent , but the people with whom i m close to where i would know that information do have attachments .","286831":"i don t do any work that isn t paid . if i m contributing to my job in some way , then i m getting paid for it .","286832":"no . it only takes me minutes to get ready for work in the morning . the only things i do are use the bathroom , brush my teeth and hair , get dressed , pack my lunch bag , and leave the house .","286833":"i ve never had connections before with anything else in my life , so it wouldn t be much different . as long as i have substantial cash on me to at least get me by prior to finding a job , i would be okay .","286834":"yes , it s quite common unfortunately . some people who follow askfm s guidelines often get banned , while there are other accounts that consistently go against guidelines that never get banned .","286835":"we usually see each other times per week .","286836":"sorta in the middle ? i m not necessarily living paycheck to paycheck these days , but i m obviously not overflowing with money either . i have some expenses coming up that i m not sure i can afford alongside rent and food and whatnot , so we ll see what happens .","286837":"i just know it s derived from the stevia plant .","286838":"i m not entirely sure , tbh . i ve always been motivated to a certain extent , whether it s to improve a relationship with someone to whom i m attached , to better myself , or to prove myself at my job and or school .","286839":"well yeah , i ve never spoken about the title of my company , what colleges i attended , or where i live .","286840":"i didn t have any old blankets to get rid of , so i didn t do anything in this scenario . but if i m buying new clothing , sometimes i ll get rid of old clothing just to make my closet less cluttered .","286841":"i think a large regular coffee from starbucks is .","286842":"sometimes , yes . i mostly use stevia artificial sugar but sometimes i ll order a coffee from starbucks with some real sugar in it .","286843":"it s my job s magazine . i m not comfortable releasing the name of the magazine , it s just one of the products my job offers alongside various other editorial content .","286844":"i have generalized anxiety disorder , so pretty much everything makes me anxious to some extent .","286845":"lately i ve been using peppermint mocha creamer .","286846":"mental illness , lmaoo .","286847":"i m a bit anxious at the moment , but otherwise fine . i m worried about my car , i m worried about finances , and i m worried about what my supervisor will think of my letter from the editor that i wrote today for the newest edition of my job s magazine that s currently in production .","286848":"yes , i ve experience apathy to various degrees especially at the height of my depression . nothing brought me joy , and everything was meaningless .","286849":"no , i m not afraid of death . i m obsessively intrigued by death and it s often the subject of my creative writing .","286850":"how to tell if a tire needs to be changed based on the degree of tread left on the tire . it won t pass inspection if it s too eroded , and if you use a penny and place it in the tread , if it doesn t reach a certain height , then you need a new tire .","286851":"i only like receiving attention from certain people , and elevated degrees of attention from others i . e . strangers makes me uncomfortable .","286852":"i ve only been open about my life for the past few years , and prior to that , i was extremely closed off and private . my paranoia was at its all time high during those times and i was afraid that people would know too much about me to the point where it would hurt me . seeking help for mental illness and understanding that there is such a stigma against the mentally ill changed that , and it made me become passionate about speaking about my experiences in order to help others .","286853":"i think it s worse when people abruptly disappear . there s no sense of understanding or closure when that happens , and it makes you wonder if you did anything significantly wrong in order to warrant someone cutting you off to that degree .","286854":"i ve been coloring my hair consistently since i was years old . i ve been bright red , dark red , orange , blonde , bright blue , bright purple , dark purple , black , and various shades of brown . my favorite color changes depending on my mood , which is why my hair is constantly changing . right now , it s brown and i m going to be making it slightly darker with some overtone later this week .","286855":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry . i seldom follow new people . i m all right , though . i got home from work a little less than an hour ago , and i m already changed into pajamas , lmaoo . my roommate and i decided that we re going to cook breakfast for dinner .","286856":"no , i don t experience road rage . driving is a major source of anxiety for me , so i m a very cautious driver and if someone else does something stupid , then i ll be a bit annoyed but that s all . my main concern is safety .","286857":"i check my personal email maybe once per week . as for my work email , my outlook application is active the entire day because i send and receive emails all day long . i monitor three different inboxes .","286858":"we have a doorbell , yeah . i m always confused whenever it rings because no one ever comes to the house unexpected , but it s happened a few times with delivery people whether food delivery or ups , or something . it doesn t bother me if my phone rings because of the time , it s spam and i don t answer it . i only answer phone calls to numbers i recognize .","286859":"i m an organized person because it s much better for my mental health . i m less anxious when everything is in its rightful place , and i notice that if i do allow things to get cluttered , it s an indication that my depression might be slipping back in .","286860":"i like cleaning routinely , and i prefer clean and organized living spaces . too much mess or clutter makes me really anxious and claustrophobic , so i always pick up after myself whenever possible . when it comes to household chores , my roommates and i take turns with the cleaning , but i do have a tendency to do a little extra around the house even after they re done with their part , lmaoo .","286861":"i prefer to handle things on my own whenever possible . i never ask for help with anything because i don t want to appear needy or dependent on anyone , with the obvious exceptions of when i m too sick to move . i even felt bad asking my roommate to bring me a glass of water when i had the stomach virus two weeks ago , lmaoo .","286862":"i don t trust people to do things , unless it s something that i m not skilled in , like people who are mechanics , construction workers , etc etc . when it comes to personal projects , i prefer to take on the projects solo because i don t trust that others won t make mistakes . it s why i had a huge problem with group projects when i was in school , and i would usually take control of most of the project myself because i didn t want my grade on the line .","286863":"one of my coworkers has never let me down , although i ve only known her for less than two years . she s one of the sweetest , most genuine , and selfless people i ve ever met and she gives the world to everyone in her life .","286864":"the last mistake i made was vaping when i was sick with a stomach virus , lmaoo . it isn t a huge mistake by any means , but it definitely made me feel sicker because i wasn t ready to begin with nicotine again yet . i try not to dwell on past mistakes , especially those that cannot be changed or fixed . it s negative energy , and i m trying to rid my life of negative energy .","286865":"i m definitely not as anxious now as i used to be in the past , but i still experience some degree of anxiety . this is the least anxious i ve ever been in my entire life throughout the rest of my life , i was anxious to the point where it was debilitating .","286866":"i ve been on psychiatric medication for three years now . if i stopped taking them or my antidepressant , at the very least , i feel as if i would fall into a severe depressive episode and begin having panic attacks again . my medication soothes and quells most of my symptoms , ranging from depressive episodes to severe mood swings to anxiety to panic attacks , etc etc . i wouldn t want to risk it , tbh . i ve been doing so well on medication that i know it would have a bad , detrimental effect on my well being if i abruptly stopped taking them .","286867":"i don t have any cool plans within the month of january , no . the most exciting plan i have is this saturday i have to bring my car to the mechanic , get new tired installed and rotated , and get an oil change . haha .","286868":"i m not entirely sure , lmaoo . i m sure it s because they enjoy my answers , but i don t really find my answers to be anything spectacular .","286869":"we all do . we take turns doing the cleaning , or we ll have certain people do certain rooms and rotate accordingly week by week .","286870":"i drink times per week these days . normally i ll have a few glasses of wine , but i also drink ipas beer and hard seltzers .","286871":"i can understand why those people feel the need to do so , but i also respect people more if they re outspoken about what they believe regarding if there are more efficient ways to do things , etc . if you re solely placating a superior in order to get on their good side for your own personal gain , even if you don t agree with them , then i don t really find much respect in that .","286872":"i don t normally eat chocolate , but i used to like the hershey s cookies and cream bars .","286873":"i m not religious , so i have no religion .","286874":"i ve always tried to sweat out the fever , personally . i m not sure what the right way to control a fever is , but i usually layer up in clothing and sleep with a few blankets on me , and i feel a bit better by morning .","286875":"what are your passions ?","286876":"one of my only talents is writing . i enjoy writing creatively , and i ve been told that i m an excellent , precise writer .","286877":"honesty , loyalty , and communication .","286878":"sleeping in on saturday and sunday , playing video games in the afternoon after having a hearty breakfast and drinking lots of coffee , and casually doing some easy household chores like cleaning my bedroom to make myself feel productive . i don t like leaving the house on the weekends , so a weekend where i didn t have to run any errands would be most ideal .","286879":"idk , probably purchase a new blanket and pillowcase set off of amazon last week . it wasn t something i set out to do , but i was browsing amazon and saw it and the blanket looked so cozy , and i ve also been wanting a new blanket to snuggle up in . so i bought it on a whim .","286880":"i would much rather stay home , watch television , and eat snacks , lmaoo . music shows are fun and everything , but i ve never been to a festival before and the idea of one freaks me out because of my social anxiety . i can t be around crowds of people .","286881":"work , lmaoo . even when i m not working , sometimes i think about different ways i could streamline my work processes to be faster and more efficient .","286882":"last year , my boyfriend bought me one of those personalized love books , where you can customize what each person looks like and add whatever pages you want in order to tell the person what you love and appreciate about them . there was a page at the end where he wrote something totally sentimental and sweet , and it was one of the nicest gifts he s ever given me .","286883":"my th birthday was pretty memorable . my boyfriend bought tickets for us to go to a wine tasting event at a local aquarium . there were kiosks of different wineries offering free samples of their wine that you could try an endless amount of times , there was a giant food platter with cheeses and meats and breads , and there was live music downstairs . it was a lot of fun .","286884":"i want to get in touch more with my creative side , i . e . writing more often , drawing painting more often , etc etc . i also want to get back into reading books .","286885":"i like going to nature preserves and the beach .","286886":"best quality i m compassionate towards others . i m creative . i m motivated and dedicated toward my goals . worst quality my mood swings make me very unpredictable in situations . i have a tendency toward self destruction in the face of dilemmas . i can be very jealous at times .","286887":"my boyfriend and i were preparing for a wedding a few years ago . he asked me to hand him his suit pants , and for some unknown reason , i thought he said soup cans . him hey leigh , can you hand me my suit pants ? me soup cans ? why do you want soup .","286888":"i m not willing to give out my email address .","286889":"a lofi hip hop stream on youtube . https www . youtube . com watch ? v yakefononeg","286890":"countries are comprised of both land and people . a country is a physical mass of land , and it s the people who inhabit that land and the culture of those people that defines what a country is .","286891":"no , i would never want to break up someone else s relationship because that s disrespectful . i m already in a relationship , at any rate .","286892":"partially , yes . i m surviving based on my income , and i wouldn t be able to live , afford rent , afford food , etc etc . , if it weren t for my income .","286893":"uh , yes ? nobody claims ownership over another human being , and it s inherently wrong to keep someone as a slave no matter what context it s in .","286894":"you d be better off asking someone who s actually a teacher , or at least in the profession of education .","286895":"either massachusetts , new hampshire , vermont , south carolina , or virginia . maybe even colorado or oregon .","286896":"according to the google , rapping is always the rhythm and delivery of a song according to a beat . singing doesn t always have to accompany a beat .","286897":"in theory , no . but in practice , it could sometimes hurt people depending on the situation . you have to really gauge the situation and weigh the pros and cons of being brutally honest . it might not be the right timing , for example .","286898":"yes , i ve experienced this on many occasions . perhaps not move to another country , but definitely another state . i ve always wanted to start fresh with a new life , new people , new beginnings , etc etc .","286899":"yes , he has made me a better person . his support of my passions has encouraged me to be the best version of myself that i can possibly be .","286900":"facebook , twitter , instagram , and snapchat .","286901":"nah , i never told them .","286902":"eight years .","286903":"not all of them , which is something i m steadily working on . i ve been questioning one of my friendships with someone , but it s difficult because i m quite attached to them and i m more apt to forgive them because of my attachment to them .","286904":"no ? not everything is about romantic relationships , lol .","286905":"i don t believe there s a set amount . my account has been banned without any warning whatsoever .","286906":"i agree ! ! i m still only on the first season , though . i decided to watch it after finishing you upon the recommendation of a friend .","286907":"don t pursue a friendship relationship with someone who doesn t put in the same effort into maintaining the relationship as you do . you don t deserve to have a one sided relationship , and those who truly care about you will reach out towards you if they sense something is wrong . not everyone is perfect , but people will make time for those they care about in one way or another , even if it s something as simple as texting consistently one night or a phone call .","286908":"my life is both beautiful and tragic in an all encompassing way that is motivational , yet pensive , in the best and worst ways .","286909":"yes , lmaoo . when they showed one of the scenes that indicated he had a connection to breaking into dexter s house to leave clues , i was like , i f cking knew it . when i first saw the character in the show , i had a weird vibe about him and everything seemed to fit .","286910":"i haven t seen her to discuss it with her , she informed me that she was leaving the counseling center via text . but yeah , my plan is still the same . i want to see if i can hold my own without therapy for a while , and if that isn t working out , then i ll find a new therapist . . . even though it s going to be a pain in the ass to try to recap everything that has ever happened to me , haha .","286911":"it s a means of making money so that i can support myself and live my life . i gain pleasure out of the work i do because it s in my field of study , and i enjoy reading proofreading writing the work that i currently do . i ve also developed close relationships with a few of my coworkers , which makes going to work a little easier .","286912":"one was a woman , and the other was a man . my therapist now is in her mid s . my final appointment with her is on tuesday , though .","286913":"when i m with a few close friends , hanging out and having fun together and just living in the moment . last night , for example , was a lot of fun i went to a local brewery where a friend of mine was performing he s a rapper , and we all had a few drinks while listening to the different musicians .","286914":"no , i didn t find my therapist until after about a year of seeing my first psychiatrist . i had tried two or three different therapists before finding her , but those didn t work out .","286915":"lol , yes . it s a gorgeous day outside , which is . . . unusual , considering it s the middle of january .","286916":"i don t remember my childhood up until the age of around or , so i honestly have no clue .","286917":"lately it s been difficult for me to juggle and compartmentalize my personal life with my professional life . there s been a lot of things going on with my personal life that i can t help but carry over into work with me , and sometimes it makes me unmotivated and makes the work i m doing seem useless and mundane .","286918":"i made an appointment with my general physician , who prescribed me antidepressants and gave me referrals to some psychiatrists in the area .","286919":"no one can make me well behaved , it s something that i have to control within myself regardless of who is around .","286920":"drinking coffee , later transitioning to flavored seltzer , during the rest of the day . playing some video games until i get tired of the game in the moment . taking a mid afternoon nap . cooking an easy dinner , taking a shower , and settling down to watch some netflix at night . instead , i have to go grocery shopping , go to the bank , and visit my parents house to sort through some belongings that they discovered in the attic while cleaning it out last week . i really don t feel like leaving the house today , though .","286921":"seeking out professional help for my mental illnesses during a critical moment of my life . it was life changing , and i m grateful that i sought help when i needed it the most instead of doing something harmful or drastic .","286922":"i m normally running a tad bit late for work these days , so i tend to get ready in a hurry in the mornings . i take my time with my actual work when i m at my job , though . i don t like missing things or making mistakes .","286923":"yes , we all have our own televisions in our rooms .","286924":"it can be , yes . depression can be characterized by irritability .","286925":"i definitely have the tendency to have a temper , but i quell it most of the time when i feel it coming on because my anger can be intense and destructive .","286926":"they don t frustrate me , no . as long as it s still a civil discussion and the other person doesn t resort to personal attacks , lol .","286927":"i think it s sweet that someone is using their own faith to show their support for a person if they re struggling . even if i don t agree with their religion , i can appreciate that they re applying what they know in order to be a supportive person . like i said earlier , i just don t like when people try to force their own beliefs down my throat in order to try to convert me .","286928":"i don t eat cereal .","286929":"i don t truly know who i am on the inside because who i am is constantly fluctuating and changing depending on who i m with . i m a scorpio , and there are some aspects of scorpios that i do relate to , but there are also some that i also disagree with .","286930":"i don t really know what you mean by spirited discussions .","286931":"no one deserves to be in a relationship with someone who doesn t reciprocate the same effort you re putting into the relationship , and someone doesn t deserve you if you take advantage of the relationship and don t put enough effort in either . relationships should be a mutual exchange of time , effort , and energy , and it will only succeed if you re both striving to better yourself and the other person with constant support and reassurance .","286932":"i ve considered going vegetarian when i was younger , but meat is basically a staple in my diet because it s an easy form of protein . i do try to buy alternatives whenever possible , though .","286933":"i ve struggled with depression for more than half of my life , so i don t believe i ve ever been genuinely happy . there are things that bring me pleasure , but the depression is always lurking in the background .","286934":"i don t like when people use the term crazy to refer to something wild or ridiculous , it s directly stigmatizing against those who struggle with mental illness . however , the most wild thing i ve ever done for someone i loved was probably move miles back home just so i could be with them during their time of need .","286935":"yes , lmaoo . i initially thought that one of my coworkers was incredibly rude and obnoxious because i didn t know her very well at all . but as i got to know her , we steadily became close friends and now i think she s the sweetest person ever .","286936":"uh , why wouldn t that be okay ? people , regardless of gender , can wear whatever they want .","286937":"i only really post my opinions when people ask for them specifically . i also enforce those beliefs when other people are becoming pushy first in order to prove a point .","286938":"yeah , i believe so . i m more apt to be rude to anons , especially if they re saying something hurtful or trying to push their beliefs onto me .","286939":"my brother was the one who told me i needed at least one new tire , he recommended two because it s best to buy them in pairs . he s been a mechanic for years . the tread on one of my back tires is completely shot and i can t drive on it for much longer without it going completely flat . another days driving on it won t be a big deal as long as i keep an eye on the tire pressure and fill it up if my tire pressure light comes back on . the tires should arrive on tuesday , and then i m taking my car and the tires to my regular mechanic on saturday .","286940":"when people talk over you while you re in the middle of speaking , it shows they don t respect or care about what you have to say and they just want to put their two cents in with no regard to anyone else . i also get angry when people try to push their beliefs onto me or others because , again , it shows a lack of respect .","286941":"mixes , lmaoo . i m not skilled enough to ever make something like that from scratch . like i said , stuff like that is more of a chore for me .","286942":"i disagree . i ve been through significant hardship , both first hand and through others , and i ve never felt the need to pray because it doesn t apply to my life . i don t appreciate the pushback you re giving me when it comes to praying . some people simply don t pray , it means nothing to them .","286943":"cookies and muffins , mostly .","286944":"no , i ve never felt the need to be anonymous because of the fact that i m totally open with my thoughts and my life . i don t need to hide who i am in order to express my opinion on something . i do appreciate the anonymity , because it gives others the chance to ask for advice without revealing who they are , but a lot of people totally take advantage of it to a negative degree .","286945":"positive thoughts i m grateful that today is a sunny day , and it feels nice to have the blinds open to let the natural light in . my coffee tastes amazing this morning . i m happy that i have today off from work , because last night was a pretty wild night and i need time to recover lol . negative thoughts i m not looking forward to paying for two new tires for my car , the labor involved in my mechanic s work , and the extra money for an oil change later this week . my boyfriend s dog is dying , and he ll likely have to be put down within the next weeks . i m keeping my best friend in my thoughts because her grandmother , whom she was close with , passed away last week .","286946":"i don t enjoy cooking , but baking is something i enjoy a little bit . i do consider it somewhat of a chore , haha .","286947":"i m not religious or spiritual , so praying would do nothing for me .","286948":"it s pretty equal , especially around my boyfriend and close friends . they know basically everything about me . i just have an easier time describing my thoughts on social media because i m better at writing than speaking verbally .","286949":"i was feeling lazy , so i just heated up one of those jimmie dean veggie egg white breakfast sandwiches .","286950":"i follow the cast of it s always sunny in philadelphia on instagram , and their posts are pretty hilarious .","286951":"only my boyfriend and best friend know that i use askfm . as for whether or not other family members check up on my page , if they know it exists then they ve never told me .","286952":"i only woke up an hour ago , lmaoo . so far , all i ve done is make breakfast and drink some coffee while perusing social media .","286953":"sushi and or burrito bowls .","286954":"hopelessness despair . i experience it every once in a while , and it pops up out of nowhere at times . it s all consuming and makes my heart and insides ache .","286955":"thanks , i appreciate it","286956":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","286957":"i like cherry dr . pepper , but that s basically the only soda i drink .","286958":"no , i don t go to the gym .","286959":"probably , lmaoo . i m on askfm more than any other social media due to the volume of activity i receive .","286960":"no , it doesn t have an effect on my life so i don t have an opinion regarding what other people do in their lives .","286961":"a hour live stream of lofi hip hop beats , lol . https www . youtube . com watch ? v yakefononeg","286962":"well , i have a twitter account if you would like to dm me on there . my username is poetalunam same as here .","286963":"nah , it doesn t annoy me at all . i like scrolling through my inbox in the morning and seeing which questions have been asked to me . it s also when i delete questions accordingly if they re trolling or just flat out dumb questions .","286964":"i m a slytherin .","286965":"i don t generally use askfm to chat , but you can certainly ask me questions .","286966":"it s currently pm on sunday afternoon .","286967":"thank you","286968":"it s been a lot more these days because people are trying to fulfill their vip requirements , so i ve been getting a lot more questions than usual .","286969":"i do both . whenever i log into askfm , i answer the easier questions first , and if something requires more thought behind it , then i ll take my time with it until i can think about a good answer to the question . i have questions in my inbox leading back to , like , a month ago for this very reason . lol .","286970":", currently . well , after i answer this one , lol .","286971":"if a writer falls in love with you , you can never die .","286972":"? ? ? they re adults , and it sounds like they have a promising life ahead of them .","286973":"nah , i m going with my roommate and one of my other friends might meet us there later on ! ! my roommate is driving , so i ll be safe .","286974":"thanks ! ! should be a good time , the venue is a brewery so there will be some drinks involved too .","286975":"he s a rapper , so he ll be performing on stage some of the new songs from his latest album .","286976":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry . i m doing well today , though . a bit peeved because i m going to have to spend some money on new tires for my car , but i m going to see a friend perform live tonight , so at least that s something .","286977":"i don t get embarrassed easily , but there are two embarrassing moments that stick out in my mind , lmaoo .","286978":"thank you","286979":"i have some knowledge of finance , enough to get me by at least . i do believe having internet access makes getting information about finance easier , though , as it is for a variety of other areas of knowledge .","286980":"my friend courtney she used to use askfm , if anyone remembers her called me last night we had a hilarious conversation .","286981":"no , i don t smile at strangers . i think i pissed someone off today , though lmfaoo . i was driving and making a right turn onto a main road , and some dude was about to cross the street with his bicycle . so he looked angry and was like , go ! just go ! and i started laughing hysterically .","286982":"i ve never trusted anyone straight away from the beginning , and i believe that trust is something to be earned instead of expected .","286983":"what the f ck kind of fetish is this even .","286984":"no offense , but no . i m not really in the mood to read someone else s story rn .","286985":"no . i m not

the reality of the situations being leaked to the public would cause a mass frenzy .","287054":"the platforms themselves don t manipulate people , but the way other people can use them do . on social media , people often present their ideal selves instead of their realistic selves , posting about their accomplishments instead of their downfalls and basically pretending that they re happy if they

go anywhere besides work , the grocery store , and the pharmacy these days . going anywhere else , if i m the one driving , makes me super anxious . i m supposed to bring my car to my brother s

preservation instead of actually feeling guilt or remorse .","287092":"i remember when i was growing up , i wanted to be a teacher . i m assuming that it was an influence of my own teachers that i had

and i can t even find solace in my dreams because they re just as distressing lately .","287212":"well , i found out today that my boyfriend s dog is going to be put down in two weeks most likely , so that has really saddened me and i m going to be a miserable wreck when the day comes .","287213":"i m obsessive about certain things , but i don t have ocd at least i ve never been diagnosed with it , lol .","287214":"i can t do that , honestly . i ve tried isolating myself but i become so desperate for human contact that i go against my own promises and contact other people anyway . i ve tried testing others by not texting them for periods of time to see if they ll contact me first , but i always cave in .","287215":"chores organizing doesn t calm me down or anything , but i enjoy the feeling of having a fresh and clean living space when everything is done .","287216":"it has a detrimental effect on my mental health because when someone doesn t reciprocate the same energy , i take it super personally and can become resentful towards that person .","287217":"i like cleaning the house , tidying up my bedroom , and doing laundry on the weekends . it gives me time to be productive , as well as relax and do some self care when i m done .","287218":"doing household chores and relaxing .","287219":"no , i never have seen it as a competition to see who has it worse or anything . people in the mental health community need to stick to one another in terms of having mutual support , and my ears are open to anyone who s struggling because i ve been there before and i like letting people know that they re not alone and help is always available .","287220":"sometimes , but not all of the time . i invest too much energy in others who don t invest the same energy in return , but it s simply a part of who i am . i feel things too deeply , i take things too emotionally , and i become very attached to people .","287221":"i ve had disordered eating habits , but i wouldn t classify myself as having an eating disorder really . i ve refrained from eating despite being hungry in order to lose weight , but it never lasted very long because of hypoglycemia . i ve skipped meals purposely to get drunk faster if i knew i was going to be drinking that night .","287222":"i ve felt that on numerous occasions , particularly because i have depression that stems back to when i was a pre teen . it s a feeling that i m all too familiar with and it s an indication that i m slipping into another episode .","287223":"my compassion and dedication towards those i care about .","287224":"my creativity . i ve been creative in various ways for as long as i can remember , and i ve always expressed myself via creative means . i ve dabbled in music , in photography , in art ,

oreo ice cream is my automatic go to .","287227":"i don t watch reality shows anymore , but i used to like all of the various tattoo related reality shows , like the one kat von d was in years upon years ago .","287228":"november .","287229":"uh , yeah ? men can be friends with women regardless of who s in a relationship with who . if you don t trust your boyfriend husband to be friends with other women , then there s something much deeper going on with the lack of trust you have in your partner and you probably shouldn t be with them in the first place . to control who your partner is friends with is super manipulative , too .","287230":"i did it because i was high and wanted to see if i could get away with it . it was exhilarating .","287231":"well , these are significant worries so they do matter . i don t really feel like going into what s going wrong with things in my life at the moment because they re personal things , but combined with my poor mental health , it s making everything else in my life like work , for example seem so mundane .","287232":"waiting in traffic for over an hour because there s an accident on the side of the road and everyone else feels the need to slow down and stare at the wreck instead of driving forward .","287233":"drinking the most amount of coffee in one sitting , lmaoo .","287234":"slashed a stranger s tires in the middle of the night

makes me cry every time . especially if the owner is a veteran and they re coming back from the military .","287237":"healthy coping mechanisms would be venting to friends , distracting myself with books and video games , writing or painting , working longer hours , etc etc . instead , i m sitting here at pm and drinking alcohol by myself .","287238":"i m not doing so great right now , tbh .

.","287242":"i m sad at the moment . there s too much going on , both around me when it comes to events , as well as in my head . i feel powerless .","287243":"it could be for some people , sure . you re establishing control over the course of your own life when everything else seems to be spiraling out of control .","287244":"i lived with my parents prior to moving into the new house .","287245":"no , this is really the first time i ve ever had bad heartburn before .","287246":"not really , no . i like the independence of cooking whenever i want according to what i want to do .","287247":"mg at the moment . the rexulti is used as an adjunct to the antidepressant to make it stronger , and i m on mg of that every day as well .","287248":"well , that makes two of us . i m

the other .","287254":"well , most of them are about various types of murders , so yeah .","287255":"now that i m living on my own , i love the house i live in and the freedom that comes with it . i don t answer to anyone besides myself , and it s so liberating to do what i need to do for myself without anyone questioning me .","287256":"i don t usually eat candy . but i used to like twix bars .","287257":"whenever i go socialize , i normally meet my friends at a local bar and we drink casually while catching each other up on what s happening in our lives .","287258":"brushed . that s really all there is to it . i brush my hair in the morning to get out the knots , and then i m on my way .","287259":"skyrim is the best , and my all time favorite , video game . i ve been playing it off and on for the past seven years , and i just recently picked it up again and started a new game . i love the atmosphere . i love the variety of quests and results of quests that influence the world around you . i love exploring and coming across interesting scenery or interactions from the npcs . the story line itself is beautiful , and the music is delightful .","287260":"i m sensitive to a certain extent , but it all depends on my mood . there are times where i m sensitive to every single little thing , as if my skin is tender and raw and hurts wherever touched . but there are other times where i m cold as stone .","287261":"depends on how bad the anxiety is , because i have both generalized anxiety and panic disorder although in remission , i haven t had a panic attack in ages . sometimes , i ll try some deep breathing exercises and attempt to rationalize my anxiety fears , while other times i need to pop a xanax or two to really calm down .","287262":"at home , i use stevia artificial sugar . if i m buying from starbucks or dunkin , then i ll just use regular sugar .","287263":"england . it has always seemed like an interesting place to visit , especially given the history behind it all .","287264":"sometimes , but not very often . i ve learned over the years to allow certain things to roll off my back because it isn t worth the energy to invest my emotions into something .","287265":"i normally take my coffee with two packets of sugar .","287266":"i m assuming flats mean boneless wings ? if so , then yeah i prefer boneless wings . i seldom eat wings to begin with , but i like the parmesan garlic wings from buffalo wild wings .","287267":"take my medication , turn off all of the lights , put my phone on silent , and curl up under all of my blankets .","287268":"probably somewhere in the s or s , tbh . i was an overachiever in high school , but there were some classes that were super difficult and i couldn t grasp the material well and also the teacher sucked .","287269":"the exchange i had two days ago with an anon whose ableist privileged questions were detrimental to those with mental illnesses , especially considering the audience to whom they ask questions are mentally ill individuals . i had a significant exchange with them for a while , but i m not quite sure my messages resonated with them .","287270":"clean up after yourself

that isn t something that particularly interests me . i don t have a big following on any social media besides askfm , and i go hours without checking social media because of my job and personal responsibilities and whatnot . i also wouldn t like being in the spotlight like that , either .","287276":"coffee , smh . it s my ultimate downfall and my sweetest release .","287277":"tbh , it reminds me of the episode of dexter i watched last night , when dexter poses as a patient to investigate a psychiatrist whose patients keep completing s icide . the psychiatrist actually gets into dexter s head somewhat and starts questioning dexter s need for control over every aspect of his life .","287278":"yes , i most certainly do know what falling in love feels like as well as being in

insignificant things like hairstyles , for example .","287287":"right now , i m listening to music and answering questions on askfm .","287288":"thank you so much ! ! i needed this little boost today , this week has been rough so far .","287289":"if my only interest in this life was murder , that would be quite concerning , my friend .","287290":"i just answered a similar question the how was your

day has been good . i rushed to work this morning because i left super late i stayed up until am last night , ugh , but i managed to get there on time . i ve been home for about an hour now , and i m

lmaoo .","287299":"trying to get over some heartburn by eating carbs and drinking ginger ale . lmaoo .","287300":"thanks ! ! i appreciate it","287301":"i don t have enemies , but regardless , although you do have the freedom of speech you do not have the freedom to blatantly disregard everything i have told you about mental health and how you ve been problematic for months now . if you believe we should simply agree to disagree , then there is no further point in pursuing this topic . you re obviously steadfast in your innocence .","287302":"being privileged can be beneficial , but to not acknowledge your privilege or use it to the greater good of lesser privileged people yes , that is wrong . although you re anonymous , i do know you to an extent based on what you have offered me in your replies to this thread .","287303":"yes , there are unfortunately people who claim to have mental illnesses that they do not have in order to feign sympathy from their peers . there s no financial gain involved , but there s definitely a social gain if their following is oblivious to their lies .","287304":"? ? ? when it comes to science , medicine , and factual evidence , there is such a thing as right versus wrong . to try to claim that there s no right or wrong is privileged .","287305":"i m passionate about mental health awareness , erasing the stigma associated with mental illness , and educating people who are uneducated like yourself in order to see the greater light regarding those who are mentally ill . coming from someone who has struggled greatly with mental health issues for basically my entire life , it is a passion of mine to help others who struggle with the same things .","287306":". . . putting stuff on you without your consent ? what is that even supposed to mean ? lmaoo . i m providing you with facts , which are the truth . your opinions are ableist and wrong . and if you continue to spew your problematic views on my page , i ll simply stop answering eventually . if you re not going to acknowledge that you re wrong , then your best option here is to stop asking me questions .","287307":"mental health isn t getting worse overall . mental health has always existed , and it s only recently that it s begun to be less stigmatized in society . people are talking about it more because they will not be k lled , locked up , or chastised for talking about mental illness . big pharma doesn t exist either . medication has been proven to help individuals in several different ways , and there s nothing wrong with taking medication to aid in mental health recovery . thousands of people have gone into full remission thanks to medication .","287308":"i m not being condescending . i m just calling you out on your problematic behavior , and you re trying to turn it around by claiming you re innocent despite all of the wrongdoing you ve done in the past to not only myself , but multiple other askfm users . once again , not an apology .","287309":"you re questioning the expertise of psychologists , psychiatrists , licensed clinical social workers and mental health counselors , etc etc . , by calling them so called experts . those people , above all else , determine the degree to which an individual is mentally ill and treats them accordingly . it isn t your authority to question the expertise of those individuals , and in doing so , you re questioning the plausibility of other people s mental illnesses as well . not to mention the fact that you ve personally questioned my own mental illnesses , as well as the mental illnesses of others , and have tried to chalk them up to normal behavior when they re clinically abnormal .","287310":"it isn t condescending if it s the truth you are ableist and insensitive towards others with mental illness , and although i ve pointed out a plethora of ways that you are , you still won t acknowledge , apologize , or change your behavior .","287311":"people who disagree with the plausibility of mental illness are not experts on the subject , and that goes for most areas of medicine . medicine does advance every day , but even so , it s your attitude that is most bothersome because you still will not admit that you ve done wrong . over the course of the past few months or longer ? , i ve seen you question others on askfm who are also mentally ill , and one by one , you ve been shot down . i entertained your gig for a while , but it s time for you to acknowledge that your perception is problematic .","287312":"that isn t condescending . mentally ill isn t an ableist word , and it s correct to call out ableism when i see it . it s unfortunate that you simply cannot own up to your mistakes , but what else is new from an anon who believes they re smarter than everyone else . lmaoo .","287313":"a lot of people are ableist and they re unaware that they re being ableist . that s why i said i ve tried educating you in the past , but you won t listen . you armchair diagnose people . you use outdated , stigmatized terms like insanity and psychopathy to refer to mental illnesses . you question the authority of mental health practitioners who know more about mental illnesses and general medicine than you do . your attitude and tone of voice is extremely condescending and does nothing but cast doubt on everyone who s mentally ill to whom you ask these questions .","287314":"you don t have to know everything about everything in order to be considered an expert in your field . also , your ableist attitude toward those with mental illnesses and practitioners who specialize in mental health is becoming quite alarming . i understand your need for inquisition , because psychology is indeed a fascinating subject , but perhaps think of your audience and your tone of voice before questioning the behaviors of people . i ve tried to educate you in the past on mental illness , but apparently nothing i said has stuck in your mind , otherwise you wouldn t be behaving in this fashion .","287315":". . . so called ? lmaoo . someone doesn t go through years of schooling , internships , and residencies just for others to question their expertise on medicine .","287316":"i m not qualified to diagnose anyone with a mental illness , and neither is anyone else unless they re a certified psychologist who sits down one on one with trump to conduct a psychiatric evaluation .","287317":"sanity and insanity are largely used in a negative connotation to refer to things related to mental illness , and it further stigmatizes those who struggle with mental disorders .","287318":"some people don t seek to escape . some people seek to live , and i think that s something we should all strive towards .","287319":"no , just the opposite really . life is about what you make of it , and we create meaning in life to give ourselves and our own lives a purpose . our purpose is our existence .","287320":"everyone has a different definition of how existence works , and i think that s acceptable . but i agree to a certain extent escapism is really prevalent in society , and we seek to create meaning in the mundane .","287321":"existence in general . the reason why we exist , how we ve come into being in the first place , what existence truly means , etc etc . sometimes at night when i cannot sleep , i think deeply about my own existence and it makes me believe that we re all just some sort of simulation or game in the grand scheme of things of something we simply cannot understand .","287322":"i believe we re seldom the source of our own problems , although i do admit that we can sometimes exacerbate our problems by focusing on them too much .","287323":"civil unrest , as well as the recent actions trump has made against iran which no doubt has been influenced by his recent impeachment .","287324":"i generally have negative feelings towards settling for someone because it makes me think that a person isn t striving to better themselves or their partner because they re simply comfortable . i don t think you should ever settle you should continue to improve , both yourself and your partner , and you both should be growing continuously together in harmony .","287325":"everything i ve learned about politics , mental health awareness , and civil rights in general over the years i ve been here . i also really love the friends i ve made along the way i m close to many people , especially those who don t use askfm anymore .","287326":"pretty much everything that has to do with driving , lmaoo . i hate when people switch lanes without using their blinker , when people cut in front of me , when people swerve in and out of lanes in a mad rush , when people ride too closely to me even though i m going at or over the speed limit , and when people drive too slowly in the left lane .","287327":"good morning texts , the first cup of coffee in the morning , having a fun night out with friends , playing a video game i enjoy with a few friends , watching one of my favorite television shows while sipping some tea or wine , listening to music while i can hear the rain hitting the window , watching snow fall , being complimented on my writing , etc etc .","287328":"it depends entirely on what s irritating me , haha . i very seldom lose my cool , though . if anything , when i m very angry , i get scarily calm , collected , and methodical .","287329":"i like literature , and i actually minored in english literature when i was in college . i prefer psychological thrillers and fantasy novels .","287330":"i haven t been to another country besides my home country , so i don t have an answer to this question .","287331":"a new wardrobe , a house , unlimited money towards my starbucks card , a bunch of art for the house , and fancy furniture for the house .","287332":"i have an android phone , so fortunately it doesn t have the seen option , haha . but if i do see a message , i try my best to respond to it as soon as i can remember .","287333":"i wouldn t know if i had gray hair or not . i ve been coloring my hair since i was years old .","287334":"unfortunately , i m the one who makes the plans most of the time . it frustrates me , because often i think about just distancing myself completely and seeing if anyone will text me first for a change . but i m impatient , and when i m feeling social i feel the need to go out as soon as possible , so i cave and wind up texting others anyway .","287335":"coffee , lmaoo . most of my extra spending money goes towards starbucks and or dunkin .","287336":"no . i believe sexiness is something that s internal , meaning it s a feeling that exudes itself when you re confident in yourself regardless of how exposed you are . of course , everyone has their own definition of what sexy is , though .","287337":"i try to sleep as much as i can , distract myself with television and video games , and read . i was extremely ill this past weekend and only started feeling better last night , which is why i felt okay enough to go to work this morning .","287338":"i probably have when i was much younger and more of a grammar fanatic , but these days , no . i don t care about other people s grammar besides when i m proofreading copyediting my coworkers writing assignments at work .","287339":"well , in regular jobs you re allowed to request time off but it s up to the employer s discretion whether or not they ll allow you to take that time . however , if you have the pto or vacation sick time to make up the hours and you request the time off far enough in advance , i don t see why they wouldn t give it to you .","287340":"i t boned another car while driving down a side street to go to burger king lol . i couldn t swerve out of the way in time because they were crossing over the street and blew right through a stop sign , and i had the right of way . it totaled my car .","287341":"my work week is strictly scheduled wake up around am . leave the house around am . work from am to pm . get home around pm and do some casual household chores , i . e . unloading the dishwasher , putting out the garbage , etc etc . relax with a cup of tea or some seltzer over ice . cook dinner and clean up . shower . relax in front of the television until it s bed time . my weekends , however , are a free for all , lol .","287342":"i prefer pancakes over waffles , although i m not really a big fan of either tbh .","287343":"happy monday ! ! it s my first full week back at work in two weeks , and i m definitely not looking forward to the rest of the work week , lol .","287344":"thankfully , no . most of my friends experience joint pain , especially if it s in places where they ve had prior injuries .","287345":"i m all right . i went back to work today after taking friday off due to being sick , and i had a hell of a lot of work to catch up on , lmaoo . but i managed to get through everything i m back on track again . other than that , i m feeling mentally fine probably because i was busy all day . however , i have horrible acid reflux right now , so i m drinking ginger tea to settle myself .","287346":"that is very true ! ! they could offer me a new perspective on my issues and how to overcome them . it just sucks that , once again someone is leaving and i m going to have to start all over again . it makes me feel so helpless and inadequate , even though i know she s moving on to better herself . i think i m going to try to go without therapy for a few months , considering i m in a much better headspace now than i have been prior to moving out of my parents house . if that doesn t seem to be working well , then i ll look for someone else .","287347":"my parents didn t really emphasis it and they wanted me to focus on studying more than working . i didn t get my first job until i was years old .","287348":"some of my favorites are heathers , the crow , american psycho , sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street , the punisher , texas chainsaw massacre , house of corpses , the hills have eyes , kill bill , etc etc .","287349":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","287350":"well , i also have my psychiatrist so that s something . i m just not sure if i m ready to look for another therapist after all of these years seeing the same person week after week . thank you , though . i appreciate it .","287351":"i m not sure if i even want to . that s three years of my life i would have to recap , as well as my past of everything that has ever happened to me . it would be starting over from scratch and i have no idea if i even want to do that .","287352":"fairly impulsive , depending on my mood .","287353":"i m not entirely sure what case management is . i m assuming it s something behind the scenes .","287354":"who knows . i m not focused on having children right now .","287355":"she s not going to practice counseling anymore . she told me she s going into case management now . i asked if she was going into private practice or another center , at least , and she said she won t be seeing patients in the forseeable future .","287356":"not sure if i mentioned this here already or not , but i don t have a therapist anymore . my heart is broken . she s helped me so much in the past years i ve been seeing her and while i m happy that she s going off to pursue her own thing , i m devastated that i won t have her to talk to anymore .","287357":"one of my pet peeves is when someone constantly complains about things and doesn t make the effort to change them .","287358":"bloody marys , haha . i think they re horrible but it s definitely an experience .","287359":"sure ! ! that would be fun .","287360":"working a job earlier as a teenager . i feel like more experience and more money would have helped me in the long run .","287361":"i m not really ashamed to admit the musicians i like because everyone has their own taste and music is very diverse .","287362":"i do experience social anxiety , alongside other illnesses . i take medication for my anxiety in general , and it has helped my social anxiety somewhat as well . honestly , my social anxiety isn t too terrible these days and it used to be a lot worse . what helped was forcing myself out there day after day through working with the general public . and obviously most days were hard , but i m grateful for that opportunity because it definitely brought me out of my shell a little .","287363":"psychological thrillers , gore horror , and action .","287364":"work , work , work , work

television and netflix didn t exist back then , lol .","287377":"uh , i wouldn t have posted it otherwise .","287378":"during the work week wake up at am leave the house by am . work from am until pm . get home around pm . cook dinner , take my meds , and take a shower . do any necessary household chores . relax in front of the television until it s time to sleep . during the weekend wake up whenever , usually it s between am and am . make a pot of coffee and drink coffee while perusing social media on my laptop for an hour or two . do some laundry anywhere between loads . clean the house , which usually happens on sundays . go grocery shopping , either saturday or sunday night . eat dinner , relax with a beer or glass of wine , and play video games or watch netflix until bed .","287379":"the show dexter . i started it a few days ago after finishing you and wanting to watch something similar , and i m obsessed with it now .","287380":"probably when i was in my early s and was working a full time job or close to it . . . around hours per week while going to college full time .","287381":"my lights , assuming it s night time . i can t even read unless it s by dim candlelight .","287382":"any memes regarding mental illness or serial killer documentaries , lmaoo .","287383":"that s true ! ! i don t know the layout of our local stop shop yet memorized because i just moved to this town not so long ago , so i would definitely have a harder time with that , haha .","287384":"it would be nice to teleport to and from work every day instead of the minute commute i have to take , lmaoo .","287385":"i ve been listening to korn nonstop , and my favorite song well , one of them from them is coming undone https youtu . be csjxle lp q","287386":"lol . i was thinking that , or canned goods like string beans and corn and stuff that won t go bad if we buy them in massive bulk .","287387":"honestly , we would go into the paper aisle and get as much toilet paper , tissues , and paper towels as possible . lmaoo . that sh t is ridiculously expensive for no reason at all .","287388":"depends on the individual . some people are lazy and realize they are , but they lack the motivation to be better . other people realize they re lazy don t particularly care . there are also others who don t realize that they re lazy at all .","287389":"i don t have a number one favorite television show , but i just started watching dexter the other night i m obsessed with it .","287390":"depends on the night . because i ve been sick , i ve been sleeping between hours per night . but when i m well , it s anywhere between hours .","287391":"obviously it isn t a new movie , but i watched sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street last week , haha . i believe it was on amazon video .","287392":"no , but i ve always wanted to .","287393":"it isn t controversial . people are free to enter whichever relationships they choose , as long as everything is consensual among everyone involved . other people s relationships shouldn t be your concern , either way . focus on yourself , your life , and your own relationships and perhaps you ll have better luck with relationships instead of wrongfully feeling sorry for yourself .","287394":"uh , there s a difference between polygamy , polyamorous relationship , and an incel . lmaoo . i don t even know where to truly begin . incels have absolutely nothing to do with poly relationships .","287395":"definitely not me , lmaoo . i ve been wearing glasses since i was a toddler .","287396":"unfortunately , yes .","287397":"i need to nurture myself , first and foremost . i ve spent the majority of my life placing other people s priorities first , and i simply cannot do that anymore because it s making me neglect my own needs and desires at a time in my life when i should be focusing on myself most of all .","287398":"eh , not really . i am how i am , and as long as i m doing what s best for myself in the current moment and constantly working towards improving myself and those around me , then it doesn t matter how i age . age is inevitable , but the time we spend throughout aging is what matters .","287399":"i think some people do genuinely heal and recover , but it takes a hell of a lot of self actualization , support , and in some cases , privilege , because not everyone has the means or financial capabilities to become invested in addiction rehab programs as an example . the mental health system in general , in the united states at least , is also subpar because even with the most at risk individuals , people are released far too early in some cases and they cannot complete their programs , which leads to relapse .","287400":"neither , really . while i m not fearful of what the future holds , i also don t have high expectations for the future . i m simply taking each day as they come and striving to work to the best of my ability . as long as you can confidently say that you ve put your best effort into making every day the best you can make it at that present moment , then the future should be easier to handle .","287401":"thanks for the follow","287402":"besides going on my first cruise next month , i don t believe there s anything big that is going to happen in . i normally take each day as it comes anyway , and giant expectations only leads to disappointment .","287403":"i replaced them with each other , haha . after self harm , i relied upon smoking marijuana . after smoking marijuana , i relied upon alcohol . i haven t healed myself from the process at all , and i still have somewhat of an unhealthy relationship with alcohol except i m not drinking every night like i used to back in the day .","287404":"i love earthy scents , so some of my favorite candles are ones that smell like balsam , gardenias , and roses . i also really enjoy comforting scents like cinnamon , freshly baked cookies , and vanilla .","287405":"self harm , smoking marijuana , and alcohol at one point in time .","287406":"i always have bad hair days when i accidentally fall asleep with wet hair if i don t wait long enough before bed before its dry . i usually wake up with it looking like it s in strands , or crunched in some places and not others , and it s an absolute mess , lmaoo .","287407":"thanks ! ! i appreciate it","287408":"i don t really care about being offensive or not offensive . i just say the truth as it is , and if someone is offended by the truth , then that s on them .","287409":"it varies wildly , lmaoo . some people think i m much younger than i am and i get id d most places i go to , while other people think i m older than my actual age because of how i carry myself .","287410":"video games have always been my number one go to when it comes to distractions . i wasn t feeling well yesterday , so i spent a few hours playing skyrim to distract myself from feeling unwell , and it worked temporarily until i got tired of playing , lol .","287411":"the sound of rain dripping down the windows and against the roof on stormy nights , thunder booming in the distance , a fireplace crackling amid warm embers , atmospheric soundtracks to video games and movies , sunrises on a beach horizon , seeing my loved ones laughter , and a fresh pot of coffee on a chilly winter morning .","287412":"i have an instagram for my poetry mortem . musings and i post some of my personal essays on medium https medium . com poetalunam","287413":"combination of both . alongside my own experiences with mental illness , i ve also taken plenty of college courses on psychology , so i have somewhat of a clinical understanding of mental health as well .","287414":"shehitsback i would visit her in her state and it would be fun if she and her husband took me to some coffee shops and art museums ! ! littlesha it would be chill to spend the night just chilling , watching movies , and drinking . celinem i would absolutely love to go to a watsky concert with her ! !","287415":"i m not the biggest fan of cooking because i m mediocre at best , but i love making breakfast for everyone in the morning .","287416":"hello do you have a question ?","287417":"lately i ve been writing personal essays about my feelings and experiences with respect to mental illness and relationships .","287418":"they start off as coping mechanisms in the beginning , albeit rather unhealthy ones . eventually it does progress into addiction .","287419":"i had an active plan to end my own life .","287420":"lmao , no . that requires a lot of high academic scores , extracurricular activities , and plenty of money .","287421":"as quoted from the show how i met your mother nothing good happens after am . if it s approaching am and there s a chance for something happening afterwards . . . just go home . you won t regret going home and sleeping . i ve turned down many afterparty festivities after midnight am because i knew it was in my best interest to do so .","287422":"this sounds like someone looking for some validation on anon , waiting to see if their name will be listed .","287423":"mike shinoda ajr death cab muse . macklemore kesha . florence the machine .","287424":"i took an iq test when i was much younger , and apparently it was around or something ? i don t remember exactly but it was between and .","287425":"i have one friend in particular who is simultaneously doing great for themselves but also makes the same toxic mistakes over and over again . they go to the gym and work every day , but they also get drunk at every opportune moment and it s really concerning , and for a while i enjoyed it because they used to be my drinking buddy but now it s getting to be a bit too much . i m not too sure how to approach the subject with them , tbh . if i even should bring it up at all . i m afraid that i m going to end up pissing them off and trigger more bad behavior from them if i tell them the way i see things , and i wouldn t want them to cause themselves or anyone else harm . i also don t want to leave it entirely alone because then that s also enabling the behavior .","287426":"i much prefer comfortable clothing i m not here to impress anyone anyway , so there s no reason for me to look stylish and be uncomfortable . i mainly wear t shirts , hoodies , leggings , flannels , etc etc .","287427":"no , love at first sight doesn t exist . it s simply lust you re attracted to the idea of this person , not the person themselves .","287428":"still sick , lol . even if i didn t have the meat to make a cheeseburger , i would totally go out to wendy s and get one right now . ugh , i m just craving food so badly . i had scrambled eggs this morning , but i don t know how far i should push it . i might just make more eggs . . . sigh . tomorrow , i ll try something more as long as this feeling of wellness keeps up and the fever stays down . on another note my roommate is sick now .","287429":"i m famous for having the poorest memory of both my friends and family , lmaoo .","287430":"reincarnated .","287431":"i prefer to answer questions , especially now that i m back to work after our holiday break and i won t be able to monitor any of my friends answers to questions i send out .","287432":"i would like to eat a cheeseburger , but unfortunately i cannot do that rn .","287433":"depends on who you talk to , lmaoo . towards some people , i m quite emotionless , but to others , i m very open about my emotions . i don t act the same way around everyone , and the energy that i perceive is the same energy i emit around others .","287434":"saturday , january , . pm . degrees fahrenheit .","287435":"i mean , if you call sickness , devastation , impending war and doom , and bad news to be great then yeah , is fucking fantastic .","287436":"my therapist .","287437":"to document the news on a daily basis . although i m afraid that these days , they re becoming a bit obsolete in light of the internet .","287438":"lol , no . if i wanted to take part in a health fad , then i would do it any other time of the year , not just in january when it s the beginning of the new year . i don t put much faith in new years resolutions .","287439":"i normally drink herbal or green tea , so i have those plain . as for coffee , depends on a variety of factors . if i m making it at home , i ll use soy milk and stevia although lately i ve been obsessed with peppermint mocha creamer . if i m ordering from starbucks or dunkin , then i ll order a large coffee with two sugars and cream .","287440":"today has been significant better than any of the previous days in , by far . i actually feel human today . even though i m not recovered , i ve been able to eat solid food and drink things other than water , which has been wonderful . right now , i m just checking up on my inbox and playing skyrim .","287441":"i currently have a bachelor s degree . i ve debated on going back to school to obtain a master s degree , but i really don t know what i would want to specialize in that wouldn t be a significant waste of money , lol . obviously education is never a waste of time , but i m interested in so many different fields that i wouldn t want to end up taking a million electives or general courses and then do nothing with the subject whatsoever . ideally , i would go back to school to focus on creative writing , but unless i m already in the market with my work , that probably wouldn t help me much either .","287442":"extra cheese and pepperoni . i also sometimes like meatballs on pizza , too .","287443":"i don t usually eat chocolate , but i prefer dark chocolate .","287444":"addictions aren t comparable , and they all should be taken equally as seriously whether it s addiction to alcohol , to marijuana , to heroin , to sex , to gambling , etc etc . to compare addictions and say that x is worse than y , that s downplaying the significant distress addiction in general has on the individual and society .","287445":"if you re so steadfast in your opinion , then i don t really see why you re coming to me with it . if you have a problem with celinem , then take it up with her yourself .","287446":"doctor appointments and medication .","287447":"i realistically could because i don t need the internet really for work , but it would be an awfully dreadful existence .","287448":"i answered this question already a few hours ago . to sum it up , i said that it wouldn t be correct to compare our intelligence levels because our intelligence is in different things . i m more intelligent in things like writing , the arts , and books , and he s more intelligent in things like engineering , taking care of animals , the trades , music , etc etc .","287449":"where was i ever romanticizing him ? lmaoo . i said he was made out to almost be a sympathetic character despite his actions , which only shows how manipulative he is . his whole persona is that he s a charming yet wildly manipulative person . it s unfortunate that some women don t see that , though .","287450":"nah , i ve never pawned anything before . i don t even know where there s a pawn shop nearby , lol .","287451":"that isn t arrogant , lol . it s fine to acknowledge your own intelligence , but it isn t arrogance unless you re using that awareness to put other people down .","287452":"i don t know if the u . s . will have any allies in order for wwiii to happen , lmaoo . because let s be real , if anything this country has made more enemies than anything else within the past years .","287453":"true crime shows are just documentation of crimes that have already been famous to a certain degree . while they definitely do escalate interest in the cases , such as in the case with the documentary don t f k with cats , it isn t as if the offenders are being sympathized with or anything . they re showing the case according to facts and figures .","287454":"not at all . celinem treats others as she is treated , and if you believe she has treated you poorly , then you probably deserved it .","287455":"despicable . he went through with the strike without the consent from congress , which is wrong . he s also proving himself to be a hypocrite because he retaliated against obama for his involvement in the middle east , yet now trump has taken it a step further .","287456":"if there is another war , it s going to be on iranian soil and there probably won t be any retaliation on the grounds of the united states . i ve seen a lot of memes about how the u . s . is going to get blown up or whatever , but that likely will not happen . it s the innocent class of people in iran who will unfortunately pay for this .","287457":"yeah , i experienced that a lot when i was growing up . i couldn t connect to my peers at all , we had different interests , and i was a very shy and anti social sort of person to begin with . i don t remember much of my formative years until around high school age , but i was dealing a lot with mental illness which further distanced me from my peers .","287458":"tumblr . it s a breeding ground of nonsense , miscommunication , false information , and widespread panic .","287459":"i don t believe i ve ever met someone first hand who i thought was more handsome than my boyfriend , but there are certainly some celebrities who i find attractive as well . attraction is more than just physical attraction , though . even though he s physically attractive , the fact that i m emotionally attracted to him as well only enhances his looks to me , and in that regard , then there s no one else out there who is more attractive to me than he is .","287460":"i m a completely different person now compared to who i used to be three years ago . three years ago , i was stuck in a job that made me absolutely miserable . i was depressed , s icidal , anxiety ridden with multiple panic attacks per week , and in general very mentally ill . i was undiagnosed and untreated . however , it was close to exactly three years ago that i first began seeking help for mental illness because i was afraid i was going to take it too far . fast forward to the present day , and i have much healthier coping mechanisms , a strong support system , and i live independently away from my parents , who have always been the main source of instability in my life . i have a better job that gives me pride and a sense of productivity , and my panic disorder is basically in remission .","287461":"to put it lightly , and quite ironically , i am obsessed with the show you . when i saw the first season last year , it captured my interest greatly , not only because of my usual interests in murder and crime , but also because they make joe goldberg such a captivating and almost sympathetic character despite his actions . i finished season two the other day and holy crap , i was screaming at the final episodes . i don t want to give anything away because i m sure i have some followers who haven t finished it yet , but the ending of the second season made me go out and buy the books that the series was based off of .","287462":"aw , thank you gabby ! ! fortunately , those have always been my strong points which is why social media comes so easily to me , lmaoo . i can write well , but when i m standing in front of someone and they ask me these same questions , i verbally cannot get the words out . speaking in general is hard for me , but writing is effortless .","287463":"yes , there are a lot of towns on long island that charge for street parking . it s cents per hour .","287464":"no , i believe that toys are just toys and they shouldn t be gendered one way or the other . the generations prior to us , like our parents and grandparents , were raised with such gender stereotypes that anything that exists out of the binary of male vs . female sex is unfathomable to them . i don t blame you for being angry , for one because your mother in law is reinforcing gender stereotypes , but also because she sounds like she s also backhandedly downgrading your parenting skills . there s nothing wrong with boys playing with pots , pans , and spoons or girls playing with balls and cars . i just saw this message now , even though it was from two days ago . i hope things got resolved ! !","287465":"i can safely say that i do not feel like death personified anymore , and that i m slowly regaining control back of my bodily functions . i m actually hungry and wanting to eat , i can keep down more than just pedialyte and water , and i m not exhausted anymore ! !","287466":"a damn book ! ! my motivation and interest levels have been dwindling lately , so i haven t been able to finish reading a book in a few years . i ve always started books and gotten even halfway through them , but i haven t actually finished reading a book cover to cover in a very long time .","287467":"when i was in middle school and high school , i faked physical illness a lot to avoid going to school . it wasn t until much later that i learned that i wasn t really faking illness , i was just struggling significantly with my mental health but because i didn t think it was valid , i lied instead .","287468":"it depends on a lot of factors , i . e . if the break up was civil , if you re still friends after the break up , the relationship you had in general , etc etc . obviously in some cases it will most definitely be seen as weird , especially if the relationship did not end in friendship or was ab sive as examples , but i also believe that it can be appropriate in other cases .","287469":"i had a lot of dreams that were really bizarre i was struggling with a fever all night , but i don t remember what they were at this point .","287470":"i used to know how to play acoustic guitar when i was a teenager . i also knew some songs on the ukulele and i tried playing the keyboards for a bit as well .","287471":"depends on who the cards are from . i keep cards from certain people and throw out cards from others , particularly if there are really no messages in the cards themselves besides a typical happy birthday ! or merry christmas ! message .","287472":"well , it s only pm . however , although i m still fairly sick , i did cook myself breakfast , did two loads of laundry , and loaded the dishwasher . i also want to disinfect and thoroughly clean the bathroom after me being sick constantly in there these past two days , but i m trying to take things slowly .","287473":"i ve never had the experience of living alone before , but i think i would prefer that over living with roommates . i definitely don t mind living with other people , though , assuming that we get along well .","287474":"plaid leggings , lace tank top , and a flannel button down shirt with combat boots .","287475":"i like my nails long ish , but not ridiculously long . however , i keep them short because i chronically bite my nails and i also need them to stay short for work .","287476":"i was late to work a few weeks ago , but it was only by a few minutes . it normally takes me minutes to get to work in the morning , pending traffic , so sometimes i arrive late because i misjudge how much traffic there will be .","287477":"none of my scars have good stories behind them . they re all from self harm , with the exception of my most recent scars from skin picking that litter my arms .","287478":"creating serotonin .","287479":"i m proud of my writing , the creative essays and poetry and prose that i ve created over the years . as i ve gotten older , my style has evolved greatly and i think i m finally falling into my own voice .","287480":"definitely not . although i m interested in civil rights , i m really not interested in being around politicians because most of them are scummy .","287481":"january isn t a special or unusual month for me , so it s easy for me to endure . there are other months during the year that are particularly hard for me .","287482":"thank you . i don t have any plans , which i intend to keep that way . i just want to keep recovering until i m okay enough to return to work on monday .","287483":"last summer in celebration of my cousin s wedding .","287484":"i don t have any music saved onto my phone .","287485":"idk , i suppose early to mid january ? doesn t much matter to me , it s whatever makes the person happy .","287486":"one coworker was sick with a stomach virus over our holiday break . i also received a text before from another coworker who started displaying symptoms last night .","287487":"this is the first i ve heard about it , but i just read up on it briefly .","287488":"uh , usually in unhealthy coping mechanisms , lol . i can normally deal with small bouts of anger and ignore them , but if i m fuming , then i have a tendency to become quite impulsive and do risky things that could be harmful to myself .","287489":"i would love to receive your questions ! ! in other news i ate eggs this morning with no repercussions . i m so thankful for food , lmaoo .","287490":"i m not really a fan of cocktails these days i ve been sticking mainly to beer and wine , but if i go out and want liquor , then i ll order a vodka soda with a splash of cranberry juice .","287491":"heathers , the crow , and les miserables .","287492":"i have a brown fleece lined jacket , as well a a black peacoat .","287493":"toss and turn a lot , usually . then i scroll through social media on my phone until my eyes becoming heavy , and if that doesn t work , then my last resort is to turn on netflix and watch something until i feel myself getting sleepy .","287494":"i use chrome at home and firefox at work .","287495":"took a sip of earl grey tea . i ve been sipping it slowly because i haven t had any liquids besides water and pedialyte since thursday morning , and i also haven t had caffeine since that time either , so i m taking it hella slowly .","287496":"i become motivated when i know that the outcome of whatever it is i m doing will benefit me and or someone i love in the long run .","287497":"the shining by stephen king . american psycho by bret easton ellis . girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . the secret history by donna tartt . the gargoyle by andrew davidson . i m about to start reading you by caroline kepnes , and i m super excited ! !","287498":"eh , i think it depends on a variety of factors . i believe that if you have practiced art in the past and are passionate about it , you can still be considered an artist even if you re not practicing now . people go through rough patches where they cannot create anything , but it doesn t automatically mean they re not an artist anymore . same thing with creativity , although creativity is much more broad and means more than just simply art . you can have creative thinking and be creative without necessarily having the means to create something .","287499":"lol . well , i apologize if my responses to an obviously ignorant anon regarding mental illness and self harm don t please you , my friend . i was obviously in a terrible state of mind . if you think my response is bad , you should have seen the follow up questions from this anon , who evidently has no idea what self harm or mental illness entails . it s partially why i stopped responding besides my own mood swing , their words were pretty triggering and i didn t want to post them .","287500":"! ! ! thank you i was wrong the other day about the true definition of trauma bonding . i m not sure what the word is for what i experienced with one of my exes , then , as we bonded through our trauma as well .","287501":"nothing happened in particular , it was simply a mood swing that took a turn for the worse . however , instead of doing something desperate and dangerous , i sat down at my laptop and started writing , which helped somewhat . i m fine now . it isn t unusual for me to experience rapid mood swings like that , haha . i was fine by the morning . also , sorry it took me so long to answer this question . i ve been hella sick .","287502":"i have a pair of slippers that i wear when i m vaping outside or when i have to take the garbage out , but other than that , no .","287503":"no one i don t like being at arms with people , and it exerts a lot more energy to willfully hate someone than it does to simply ignore their presence and move on .","287504":"i feel as if there s a lot i still have to accomplish in my life , tbh . i want to eventually get married , buy my own house , become a published writer , adopt a bunch of animals , etc etc .","287505":"someone you loved by lewis capaldi https www . youtube . com watch ? v zablecsr ue","287506":"i don t remember my childhood , so i honestly don t know which toys i had while growing up . i do remember playing a lot of computer games , though .","287507":"sex is binary you have male and female sexes . if you re transitioning from one sex to another , then you re either transitioning from male to female or female to male . there s also the topic of intersex , which correlates with this somewhat , but i have to admit i m not very educated on what intersex is besides the fact that it s more chromosomal than anything else .","287508":"rainbow cookies , mini chocolate chip cannolis , and cannoli cake .","287509":"drinking and driving , probably . either that , or possession of marijuana and or paraphernalia . i don t currently have anything , but it would be my luck to be around my friends who do smoke when the cops roll around , lmaoo .","287510":"not really , no . i don t make new years resolutions because i feel like they re often doomed to fail , particularly if you re putting so much pressure on yourself to complete a certain task or not do something anymore . motivation has to come from within , and it doesn t really matter when you start giving up bad habits as long as you re ready to do so when you do .","287511":"i haven t gotten an eye exam done in like three years , but apparently i m almost legally blind . i should probably update my prescription soon .","287512":"in the beginning , all i could muster was room temperature water and some ginger ale . eventually , i was so dehydrated that i asked my roommate to pick up some pedialyte formula . i ve improved a lot since then , and now i ve been drinking water by the gallon and i moved onto weak tea , lol .","287513":"i stayed in on new years eve . i almost never go out because i think it s one of the most dangerous nights of the year to go out , so i always opt to stay inside and celebrate with friends .","287514":"my boyfriend and i are both intelligent in different ways . i wouldn t really think saying that i m smarter than him or he s smarter than me would be an accurate representation of our intelligence levels .","287515":"i m quite certain that i ve been annoying my roommates with how sickly and needy i ve been the past two days , lmaoo . i haven t asked for much , but i m still constantly afraid that i m annoying one of them with my requests .","287516":"yeah , i do believe that askfm users definitely utilize the feature more as a means of harassment than to simply mention someone s name , haha . everyone time i see the notification so and so mentioned you in their question , i cringe a little bit .","287517":"i don t do anything differently when no one is around me , except maybe sing a bit louder .","287518":"i m seldom sick , but this is one of those unfortunate moments where i am sick . i ve had a stomach bug since thursday night .","287519":"lol , no . if it was something as simple as food poisoning , then it would have probably gotten out of my system much quicker . i believe there s a stomach virus going around my office , because i was fine up until i returned to work on thursday .","287520":"thank you , friend","287521":"thank youu .","287522":"thank you . obviously i called out of work . i was up until am just trying to stay hydrated in between running to the bathroom . today , i feel a little better but i m sweating profusely so i probably have a low grade fever . i m trying to keep some toast down since i haven t eaten in hours , so hopefully this works .","287523":"sorry for everyone who has been asking me questions since last night i m okay , well mentally at least . i haven t been online because i have a really severe stomach virus and so i ve been trying to take care of that .","287524":"no . i m actually really sad , and i spent the past two hours writing something in an effort to relieve my sadness .","287525":"perhaps i m simply a masochist .","287526":"i sleep better in the cold because it means i won t sweat as much at night , lol .","287527":"no . it s useless to ponder such things because it doesn t change the past , present , or future .","287528":"no . it was completely unnecessary , and i never understood the reason behind it . i could say it was because they were ab sed the same way , but that does not excuse their actions .","287529":"alcohol , drug abuse , and self harm .","287530":"we aided in each other s destructive methods of coping with our trauma , among other things .","287531":"nearly three months .","287532":"bonding with someone through shared trauma and establishing an intimate , yet unhealthy , connection with someone because you have both endured the same type of trauma .","287533":"it was difficult for me to let go of the past because i was still living in the environment and with the same people who had ab sed me for my entire life . now that i m living on my own , i finally have the opportunity to heal .","287534":"it could have been considered love at the time . but one was not love at all , and the other was simply trauma bonding .","287535":"it s a serotonin imbalance as well as a lifetime of trauma .","287536":"ignorance and naivety . i was too young to understand true love , and my infatuation with my prior partners was idealistic and not real . i was in love with the idea of love , not necessarily the love they showed me .","287537":"i have love in my life , but i m not happy most of the time . for that , i will unfortunately thank mental illness .","287538":"yes , that happened with both of my prior relationships before meeting my boyfriend .","287539":"of course . polyamory exists and is a completely valid form of relationships .","287540":"romantic and sexual attraction .","287541":"yes , i used to routinely steal from the store i worked in as a teenager and early adult .","287542":"we started taking some of the indoor ones down this afternoon , but not all .","287543":"i am when i absolutely have to be , especially if a friend is doing something wrong that i know is going to hurt them in the end . other than that , i m very non confrontational and only wish to keep the peace and a mutual understanding .","287544":"writing something to its completion , doing some post writing copyediting , and feeling confident enough with the piece to post it online for others to read . going to work and putting in a full hours , keeping busy the entire day , and getting a lot of assignments done , while also making progress with the magazine i manage . going shopping and cleaning the house all in the same day which usually happens on sundays . it gives me a sense of accomplishment knowing that the house is filled with good food and that everything is clean , spotless , and organized .","287545":"i m not sure what my happiest moment in my life was . but one of the most recent happy moments was the day i moved out of my parents house and established my independent life in my own house with two roommates . the feeling of independence and freedom and happiness is indescribable . my coworkers always tell me how much more content i seem at work and motivated to push forward to another day , knowing that i m not afraid to go home anymore . i have so much down time for myself , i have time to write and read and draw , and things have improved so much for me mentally since i moved out .","287546":"yes ! ! she s now a mischievous little thing , but lovable nonetheless .","287547":"that s adorable ! ! my cousin did the same thing with one of her cats . we were driving somewhere late at night and the cat , she was a kitten at the time , was wandering in the middle of the street . so we scooped her , took her to the emergency vet , and after no one claimed her after a few days , they said my cousin could take her home . she named her faith .","287548":"i took back my boyfriend who had cheated on me much earlier in our relationship , but it took a while for me to establish enough trust in him again to continue moving forward . if he cheated on me again in the current age , though , i would end the relationship . i m too old to be playing mind games with people .","287549":"aw ! ! i love black and white cats , they re adorable . her name is loki . we also have another cat named tinkers not sure of the reason behind the name , lmaoo who looks just like her too , just thinner . this cat is a thicc chonk . she s pounds of fluff .","287550":"if you re going through hell keep going .","287551":"take all of the cash out of the bank and go on a cross country road trip with my loved ones , experiencing everything i could possibly experience . and if i had the time , i would travel overseas as well .","287552":"one of the kitties that i live with .","287553":"well , romantic love means that i m head over heels in love with my boyfriend being in love is much different than simply loving someone . platonically loving my friends , however , means that i do love them but there is no attraction involved .","287554":"they re equally as important to me for different reasons . romantic love is beautiful and wonderful , but platonic love is equally as important because it s healthy to have supportive friends and unconditional love from both your friends and partner .","287555":"i ve always loved dogs from the very beginning . through my boyfriend , i ve also developed a love for fish and for lizards . and now through living with my roommates , i ve loved living with cats .","287556":"of course . i experience platonic love with my close friends .","287557":"i thought that once you loved someone , that was it you lived happily ever after , and you did not experience any strife with your partner , that you and your partner were soul mates from the very beginning and everything would work in your favor .","287558":"i m not religious and never have been religious . and i did go through a period of time where i was spiritual and looked into eastern spiritual ideologies that reflected my thoughts best . these days , not so much . i don t care much for religion or spirituality and i don t care enough to put a title on my beliefs .","287559":"before i fell in love , i had a very unrealistic , fantasy like idea of love that transcended all rational thought and meaning . as i ve grown older and discovered what love truly is , i ve realized that love encompasses both passion and heartache , togetherness and loss , and the overall ability to work together through never ending obstacles while coming out stronger at the other side even if there are hurdles along the way . love is not all cute picnics and fairy tales and happiness . love can be difficult and downright overwhelming at times , but it s through communication and an acceptance of your partner , despite their flaws , that ultimately makes things work .","287560":"i have no qualms against sharing passwords with my partner because i have nothing to hide . i can understand why some couples do not share passwords , though . it s healthy to have your own life aside from your relationship .","287561":"it wouldn t make a difference to me . i m here to lead my own life , not the life my parents expect of me , and i m free to make my own decisions regardless of what they think of my partner . if they don t like my partner , then they have the option to not associate with them but i ll continue to date them as long as the relationship continues to serve me .","287562":"no , i love other people more than i love myself .","287563":"yes , my job makes me incredibly happy and i feel productive at the end of each work day . i have beautiful co workers who inspire and encourage me to keep moving forward , and my supervisor is a blessing .","287564":"a genuine warrior , through and through . she has been through so much hardship and loss throughout her life , year after heartbreaking year , but she still finds renewed motivation within herself despite her struggles and has risen her way to the top with grace .","287565":"thank you , this means a lot to me . i do like when people reach out , but i often give off the impression that i m perfectly fine because i also don t want others to worry about me . but occasionally , i ll have really bad nights and text my friends i m not doing okay and i ll get no response because it s like . . . midnight , or something . meh .","287566":"i mean , where i live it hasn t even been a full hours yet . lmaoo .","287567":"when i m in a bad mood , i prefer to be left alone because i get disappointed when i try to reach out to others and no one answers me right away to be fair , it normally happens super late at night when everyone else is asleep .","287568":"i don t believe a person s sex or gender means anything when it comes to who you re friends with . you can be close friends , and even best friends , with anyone as long as you don t give their sex or gender any significance or treat them differently because of their sex or gender .","287569":"a few hours ago , if that s something you certainly must know .","287570":"i m more of an extroverted introvert . which means that while i am an introvert at heart and need time to recharge in between being around groups of people , i m also very comfortable and willing to be with a small group of people if i m in the mood to do so . i like socializing to a certain extent , but it can only happen in small spurts otherwise i get overwhelmed .","287571":"yes , i wrote in a diary frequently when i was a young teenager . i confided in my journal , wrote poetry in my journal , and explained my anguish and woes because i had no one else around . i don t have a physical documentation of my every day feelings and concerns anymore . when i was years old , my parents dug through my bedroom , found my journal , and read it front to back . they confronted me about the contents of the journal and i lost all trust that i had in them .","287572":"drinking a cup of coffee first thing in the morning . it s my number one priority , first because i thoroughly enjoy coffee and it motivates me to get the day started . and second because i m addicted to caffeine and i ll go through withdrawals if i don t have caffeine prior to pm , lmaoo .","287573":"this isn t really relevant because there are not many people i dislike , and those i dislike are quite distant from me .","287574":"all of my hobbies , i like doing alone . i listen to music alone , i draw paint alone , i play video games alone , i read alone , and i write alone . there s a certain freedom in doing things in solitude and it brings me great peace when there is no one around me .","287575":"i m selfish when i need to be , but i m mostly selfless and often disregard my own needs if someone else is hurting or needs help with something .","287576":"unspeakable , non law abiding things that would implicate me if i discussed them any further .","287577":"my biggest pet peeve is when people interrupt me while i m talking to give their input instead of waiting until i m finished . this also goes for anyone who does this to anyone else not allowing someone to finish what they re saying in order to tell everyone something more related to them instead of the original person . i find it to be so rude .","287578":"he is my ultimate strength . granted , we ve gotten into some sticky situations together in the past , but overall he has made me a much better person than who i used to be based on his unconditional love and support of all of my endeavors .","287579":"my ultimate , number one dream is to publish a book whether it s a book of short stories , a full fledged novel , or a book of poetry . now that i ve been trying to write consistently these days , poetry and personal essays , i want to try to compile them into a book of sorts and eventually get published .","287580":"graduating from college . my high school and college years were extremely difficult for me for various reasons mental health , alcohol , drugs , etc etc , but i always had motivation to continue with my education because i knew it would lead to a better life in the future . i graduated college in with a . gpa and latin honors .","287581":"being abandoned , without reason or explanation , by my boyfriend or the friends closest to me . i honestly don t know what i would do if they cut me out of their lives completely with no warning at all .","287582":"my boyfriend , my best friend , my boyfriend s best friend , another close friend of mine who i basically consider a best friend at this point , and an old coworker from my previous job .","287583":"absolutely without a doubt . it s always been a dream of mine to travel across the world .","287584":"no , the only people i m capable of missing are friends that i m very open with . and if i miss them and or want to see them , then i have no problem with texting them and chatting .","287585":"i had a forensics teacher in high school who helped me tremendously when i was a student and even after i had graduated . he was very open about his dark past , including his struggle with drugs and time in the military , and i trusted him enough to confide in him my confusion regarding someone i knew who was addicted to drugs and i didn t know how to help them .","287586":"fall into the addiction of self harm at an extremely young age . it plagued me for the entirety of my teenage years , and i was constantly depressed , paranoid , misunderstood , and isolated .","287587":"even though it s more of a repeat of the same song over over and it s rather somber , i m most motivated when i listen to the music from the halo odst soundtrack . right now , i m listening to this compilation with a backdrop of falling rain https www . youtube . com watch ? v ew xwd blwe t s","287588":"most of my dreams are rather odd , but i cannot remember them past five minutes of waking up from the dream . the only thing left over is my perception and feelings toward the dream itself , but the details totally disappear . i do have vivid nightmares that still haunt me at times , but they re more morbid and grotesque than strange .","287589":"i m uncomfortable stating what the darkest thing someone has told me is , because it could possibly implicate them and it s personal to them i wouldn t want to betray their trust . however , i also say that regardless of what that person has done and gone through in their life , i fully believe that they re a person worthy of love and respect .","287590":"i believe it s emotionally easier to hate someone than it is to love someone which is why so many people are filled with hatred instead of opening their hearts and minds to the idea of love . if you ve been hurt in the past , it s far easier to disregard and possibly dislike that person , which further taints your relationships with others in the future .","287591":"i don t see how that could be a bad thing unless a person s race is central to the story . an example of this is hermione granger from the harry potter series her race has never explicitly been explained in the books , so there have been a lot of adaptations where she has been played by an actress who is a person of color .","287592":"i fully support polyamorous relationships . if everyone involved in the relationship is happy and things are consensual among everyone involved , then i see absolutely nothing wrong with it .","287593":"the first day of the new year has been good , and quite relaxing and drama free ! . i slept in this morning until around am , had breakfast and coffee , and bullsh tted on my laptop for a few hours while trying to go through my askfm inbox . afterwards , i got ready to go to my parents house . i just came home not too long ago . we had dinner together and a second christmas to give my father his gifts , since he was out of state on christmas eve .","287594":"on a physical level , people have told me that they like my eyes and my hair , which i agree with . i ve always loved the color of my eyes and my hair is unique to me . on a mental emotional level , people have told me that i m very passionate and talented when it comes to my writing . and although i have my doubts about my own writing at times , i do admit that i am proud of some of the works i ve written over the years , especially ones that have moved others .","287595":"no , hair doesn t much matter to me as long as it s obvious that they maintain it , keep it clean , etc etc . when my boyfriend and i started dating , he had shaggy hair . then as we got older , he grew his hair out to his shoulders . he s had it super short for the past few years .","287596":"well , obviously he must have done something wrong in order for you not to trust him . ideally , he should be understanding and receptive toward your feelings and work towards establishing trust again . you cannot force someone to trust you , so his efforts to force you to trust him will only make matters worse .","287597":"no , he s actually quite skinny and is upset that he has lost weight . he wants to start going to the gym to build up muscle .","287598":"no , i ve never pulled a fire alarm before .","287599":"i tried my best to eat healthy , lol . obviously there were some meals that i overstuffed myself with , but i chose healthy meals like lean proteins and a lot of vegetables . tonight , i kinda splurged my family ordered from outback steakhouse , and i had a oz filet mignon with a side of broccoli cheese and a salad .","287600":"definitely not . lmaoo . i m going to be swamped with emails , and i m terrified to check my inbox after being off from work since december th .","287601":"lol . no , i m rather quiet either way .","287602":"a nearly decade long addiction to self harm , beginning from when i was around the age of . i stopped self harming when i was or years old , and although i ve relapsed a few times since then , it was not to the severity that it was when i was a teenager .","287603":"you re going to go through some of the darkest times of your life . you re going to want to give up , lie down , and d e . you re going to want to scream into the void until there s nothing left but darkness . but things do get better . you become liberated . you become a better version of yourself . you can see the light at the end of the tunnel . and you should be alive to witness everything life has to offer you .","287604":"chloe price from the video game life is strange .","287605":"probably ? i honestly have no idea , lol .","287606":"i have a photic sneeze reflex , which means that i automatically sneeze in bright lights or when looking at the sun .","287607":"he s insecure about his weight , but that doesn t mean that i consider it a flaw myself , lol . we re our own worst critics .","287608":"i suppose the most exciting thing that happened in was that i got two promotions at work exactly six months apart from each other .","287609":"my current relationship is my longest relationship we ve been dating for years .","287610":"no , i don t watch competition or game shows at all . i don t have cable television , and the only shows i watch are things that are on netflix , hulu , amazon video , etc etc .","287611":"there isn t anything about his looks that i dislike . he s incredibly attractive .","287612":"i would like to see humanity burn , but the earth itself , definitely not . i value the health of the earth and its creature and i do believe that humans are a plague on the earth .","287613":"he can be quite messy at times , but it s also gotten better over the years . he ll throw his clothes on the ground instead of in the hamper , sometimes cups and plates accumulate on the table , etc etc . he used to be so much worse when we were younger , but obviously we do learn to pick up after ourselves as we get older .","287614":"i think online dating is a great idea if you re single and you re not quite sure where to look , especially as an adult . but you also have to remain quite hypervigilant about who you choose to talk to or meet because there are dozens of people in this world who prey on others in order to hurt them while giving off the appearance that they re charming .","287615":"i normally don t because askfm is for answering questions , not holding conversations .","287616":"no . if he was arrogant , then i wouldn t be dating him .","287617":"the only cons i can think of is that they can get stained easily . i don t wear white clothing very often at all for that very reason . i don t know how many items of clothing i own , tbh . i have a closet full of various shirts , blouses , dresses , etc etc . i seldom get rid of things if they still fit me , so my closet is years accumulation of various pieces .","287618":"i ve always preferred dogs over cats because i never had much experience with cats at all . however , after living with two cats for the past few months , they ve really grown on me because they re both such sweet animals . i like cats and dogs equally .","287619":"the last book i started reading but never finished was mindhunter inside the fbi s elite serial crime unit by john douglas . i started reading it a few weeks ago , but then lost interest and never picked it back up again .","287620":"abandonment by my loved ones . i know it s irrational because they have never showed any signs of abandoning me , but it s something i fear greatly nonetheless .","287621":"i don t feel it anymore by william fitzsimmons priscilla ahn . https www . youtube . com watch ? v r xniltjuw","287622":"listening to music and doing art calms me down a lot , i ve realized . particularly last night when i was drawing , i was more focused than i had been in a long time and i forgot how enjoyable the experience is to me albeit sometimes frustrating , as well .","287623":"absolutely nobody wants to see that , trust me .","287624":"i wholeheartedly agree . it s also my last day of vacation , so i m going to try to make the most out of it , haha .","287625":"not knowing if someone i cared about was alive or dead after they had overdosed on a drug . i was sitting there with them while they laid on the floor unconscious , and i was desperately trying to wake them up .","287626":"it constantly changes . however , lately it s been grandson two feet linkin park lewis capaldi korn","287627":"i m doing well . i m currently relaxing with some coffee and music , and soon i m going to get ready to go to my parents house for dinner .","287628":"if they re successful , then sure . i ve found a few businesses that i ve bought things from when i saw their advertisement on instagram .","287629":"i don t necessarily set concrete resolutions for myself at the beginning of every year because then i feel as if they re doomed to fail . however , i do want to get more in touch with my creativity , not give into more toxic friendships , and work harder at being the best version of myself possible .","287630":"? ? ? how is that being selfish ?","287631":"i love his eyes , but i also like my own eyes because they re a unique shade of green . but obviously i do like his more because they re a part of who he is , haha .","287632":"his eyes are the hue of a setting sun , speckled with the frost and dew of tree trunks on a warm winter s eve . when there are logs sitting within the flame , they erupt within his face , the sparks reflected in his pupils . his eyes are espresso poured over ice , and the warmth emitting from the cold cup resembles the comfort radiating from his eyes deepness , their darkness , their unrelenting beauty .","287633":"i m not entitled to free artwork just because someone is my friend . you re supposed to support your artists friends by buying and or donating to their work , just like anything else . it s why i bought quite a few pieces of art when i went to my friend s art show last week . usually artists primary or secondary source of income is their art , and if you cannot afford to buy their art , then at the very least you can promote it .","287634":"i ve never tried digital drawing before , and i ve only ever drawn using charcoal , pencil , and pastels . i also have painted in the past with oil paint and watercolors . besides the charcoal drawing i posted last night my first time attempting charcoal in like years , here s a piece of art i did in the beginning of the decade","287635":"? ? ?","287636":"i wholeheartedly agree ! ! shehitsback is a terrific artist , and i ve been thinking about buying one of her hoodies .","287637":"not very often , especially considering on the nights that i do go out these days , they re on work nights and i have to wake up early the following morning . i prefer going out during the week as opposed to the weekend these days because the bar is much emptier than on fridays or saturdays .","287638":"i never said that kittiemeowsie was the only positive person on this site . i merely complimented her on her positivity , and that she s a beacon of light on askfm which , as well as know , can be a breeding ground of negativity .","287639":"i ve never accepted a drink from a stranger , and i never will . there was one time my boyfriend convinced a new bartender who didn t know him and i were dating that he would buy me a drink and i would accept it . the bartender said , no way , leigh doesn t accept drinks from anyone ! but my boyfriend told him to send me over a beer . the bartender gave me the beer and i nodded in my boyfriend s direction with a smirk on my face . the bartender was floored , lmaoo . it was so amusing to see his reaction up until he saw us talking together and put two and two together .","287640":"we all paid our own separate tabs , although i suspect that the bartender put a drink or two on my friend s tab because it was significantly less money than i expected to pay .","287641":"i have been to a pool hall and stage theatre . i ve always wanted to go to a jazz club and strip club , though . lmaoo . as well as a drag bar ! ! those seem like fun .","287642":"hello nothing much . i slept in super late this morning because i stayed up last night , and i just finished eating breakfast and drinking some coffee .","287643":"it used to be a local bar that , quite frankly , was a bit shady back in the day but nevertheless , it was my second home . they ve improved a lot since those times and now they have more customers than ever before , but it deters me from going these days because of all the people . nevertheless , i prefer staying home these days .","287644":"happy new year , nikki ! ! i wish for all of the same things for you as well .","287645":"raises multiple glasses because i drank a lot last night kittie , you re a true beacon of light on this weird site of askfm . i always enjoy your positive messages , and i hope you continue being you in and finding the happiness and health you deserve ! !","287646":"happy new year ! ! i m hoping to progress a lot within the next decade , although it does seem daunting because by the time rolls around , i ll almost be years old , lmaoo .","287647":"happy new year , gabby ! ! i hope brings you so much light and positivity .","287648":"happy new year , friend ! !","287649":"i graduated college in . i m years old .","287650":"i guess this is okay considering i haven t touched charcoal in over years .","287651":"i ve heard a few , but not very many at all . i m not sure what the firework situation is like in this town since i ve never lived here before .","287652":"what is this even supposed to mean . lmaoo .","287653":"reported and blocked . . . . lol just kidding . happy new year !","287654":"the elder scrolls v skyrim video game . harry potter and the sorcerer s stone movie . game of

with my boyfriend , his best friend , my best friend , and her husband ! !","287656":"aw , thank you so much , friend ! ! i wish the same for you","287657":"no , that s what new years day is for . i go back to work on january nd .","287658":"i don t know when schools are even usually closed for , lmaoo . january nd doesn t seem terrible , though . there s really no reason to delay schooling otherwise because the holidays have already passed .","287659":"i already use their buttery garlic sauce to dip my pizza in , so i feel like the crust would be unnecessary for me . but to each their own .","287660":"i don t believe i ve ever had their garlic crust before ? sounds yummy , though .","287661":"my roommates and i ordered domino s earlier , lol .","287662":"tbh , i m bored af . i m just sitting here with a few beers and listening to music .","287663":"hello happy new year , friends ! ! my inbox is empty , so ask me some questions tonight while i wait for midnight to roll around","287664":"no , i definitely would not take upon a position of leadership in the united states government . as passionate as i am about civil rights , i wouldn t want to be in politics and be in a position where my face can be recognized .","287665":"happy new year , livi ! ! i hope brings you much success , happiness , creativity , and euphoria .","287666":"happy new year to you as well ! ! counting down hours and minutes for the east coast of the united states .","287667":"i ve always been this way . i ve never really questioned why , it s just part of who i am .","287668":"happy new year to you as well ! !","287669":"idk , his back is just very defined and he has broad shoulders . he has brown eyes , but they re brown with specks of hazel in them that are enhanced in the sunlight .","287670":"his eyes , his dimples , his smile , and his back .","287671":"it s hard to explain , lol . i go meep a lot , i squeal and flail , etc etc . i have a hard time expressing myself verbally so i just end up making sound effects to express myself without realizing it .","287672":"why do you assume i was the one who cut them off ? lol . we just became distant , and eventually stopped talking entirely .","287673":"i make more sound effects than i do actually speaking , lmaoo .","287674":"i have one old high school friend whose eyes look like blue crystals . they re such a bright , light blue that they pop immediately and they ve always been wonderful to gaze into ."}}
