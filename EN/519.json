a picture of monster labbit , instead .","480153":"mark hamill is my favorite joker voice , but heath ledger is my favorite live action joker . jack nicholson is great , as is caesar romero , but both a bit campy . i liked joaquin phoenix , but that s barely the joker , to me . batman is a lot more difficult . i think ben affleck has been the most accurate , but obviously , the movies he s in aren t super beloved . maybe that will change with the snyder cut of justice league . of the others . . . i m tempted to say keaton , but that would be a nostalgia pick . he kinda sucked as bruce wayne , and his batman was stiff and couldn t really fight . i honestly don t think we ve ever had a perfect bruce wayne batman combo in live action . i m fairly stoked to see what robert pattinson does with

have equal interest in both . they are ever present in our lives , yet most of us will never experience them except from great distance .","480250":"the stars are possibly even more interesting than the moon , since they re essentially allowing us to see into the past , because of the time it takes for their light to reach our eyes . i d love to live among them .","480251":"it s just a gif of an alien world , as far as i know . . . but the moon is wonderful .","480252":"the moon is a loyal companion . it never leaves . it s always there , watching , steadfast , knowing us in our light and dark moments , changing forever just as we do . every day it s a different version of itself . sometimes weak and wan , sometimes strong and full of light . the moon understands what it means to be human . uncertain . alone . cratered by imperfections .","480253":"yep","480254":"at best , psychopaths don t experience love in the same way as normal people . beyond that , he s actually told her

least not before coffee is made .","480261":"well , maybe you re misinterpreting , because all i did was say that a person can like someone and be bored with their lives . then i pointed out that care should be taken and that going into things unsure is never good to do . sorry if there was confusion , but thoss things are not conflicting .","480262":"i did not answer the question twice . i pointed out that the question contained two things that were not mutually exclusive , and then i offered the best advice i could . why do you care so much about my answer ?","480263":"nice . i don t have

as they say .","480270":"they are definitely pretty addictive . i love all art , so skin art just makes sense to me . it s good that you have them planned . a lot of my stuff is spur of the moment

professionally done pieces , since then . . . with plans to get more , after all the craziness in the world has calmed down a bit .","480272":"it s actually a combination of things . the eyebrow , bridge and nipple piercings were getting caught on shirts , and getting yanked all the time . . . and i actually ended up getting my nipples ripped out in a moshpit . the oral piercings were destroying my teeth , so i got rid of those . my cartilage and industrials were all so cramped together , they never healed properly even after over a year , and were keeping me from sleeping . and then my septum just got annoying whenever i had a cold . it was all just too much effort . i prefer tattoos , because after they heal , i don t have to think about them anymore .","480273":"i watch a

thing , of course . some niche enjoyment may completely bewilder most people , but if one person likes it . . . i suppose it counts . when it comes to art , like the whole banana thing . . . that may

same sense in security just show in different ways so i didnt have exposure to other ways of life . so , i had to go into the real world . i really wanted to get some life experience but i was naive to think i knew enough because i didnt , it was a cultural shock for me . i learned how majority of family households were like to the point where i made myself look like an asshole because of how shocked i was that there parents would judge them . i created a lot of enemies due to my ignorance of how my family was a part of a certain demographic . so , i didnt realize how much of my anxiety came from that until i moved back with him . thats why now ive been sticking to that demographic because envy makes people impulsive so i have to be around other people who have equal or more in order to feel safe .","480431":"well , there s judgement everywhere we look . there s people telling other people who they should and shouldn t be . theres so much pain around us . honestly not that many people out there are like my dad who was beyond selfless wanted us to be exactly who we wanted to be and believed in our dreams or passions . he truly understood individualism . there s not many people like my dad who actually put in the hard work to become successful in order to give his kids this sort of utopia so they can be secure in themselves . he knew how to embrace our strengths build and strengthen our weaknesses . it wasn t all sunshine and rainbows though . trauma diluted all the great things he was doing but i didn t realize that the only person thats ever made me safe to be me was my dad until i moved back home when i was .","480432":"he was the best teacher i ve ever had . he made me believe in myself as a writer and an out of box thinker . he let me have a creative

essay youd fail . he spent extra time with me teaching me the perfect formula for essays i have gotten perfect scores on my essays ever since that i actually made money writing them for some friends . he truly believed in me and believed in my voice ill never forget him honestly .","480433":"it felt like nothing could go wrong , like everyone in the world wasn t suffering . i could do anything . i could be anyone . it was safe to be exactly who i wanted to be and i was free to embrace it . it was encouraged in fact . it was the only time when freedom really was free for me lol it was so safe

they cant even have pain medication even though the radiation is causing insane disabilities and cancers . there s hospitals filled with children that are given up , left in a dumpster , or on the

dark hallway that led to like a door youd see in a horror movie like in saw . it was rusty metal with bars on the window and about three locks on the outside . you could see a little bit inside from the window even though it was tinted but since the light was on i could see power tools and saws were actually hanging from the ceiling . she points at it and says , this is my dad s dungeon . nobody except him is allowed to go inside it . he s in there right now . i looked at her and asked , have you seen inside it ? and when she shook her head no my survival instincts started going i just remember i made some sort of excuse to call my other friend to come hang out so we would have a reason to leave . i will never forget how dark and sinister the door looked or the feeling i got inside

so they can tell you how to speak . there has been an increase in hate crimes since everyone has been locked inside , but nobody is talking about it . there s so much hateporn all over social media .

purest of intentions , to build a place where there would be no rules , other than a peaceful existence . there are no couples for them . for them , there is only the moment . they tried to raise us to be perfect in their perfect new world and for a moment , maybe it worked . but i think they finally saw their own shortsightedness and failure in us . we always saw it in them . they attempted to unlearn jealousy , want , and hate , to not possess anything , including each other . they tried to free themselves from materialism , but soon they were drowning in it . finally we saw failure in each other and everyone was looking for a way out . happiness runs","480567":"i wish people had more of a deeper compassion for others suffering . i think people consciously can understand someone else s suffering even though a lot of people choose not too . i wish people were better at taking themselves outside of themselves and focus on someone else s pain . once you re capable of doing that it s hard to be angry at anyone because their actions seem to align with their suffering a lot of times its not about you . so , i wish people would stop making themselves out to be a victim when someone is acting out due to pain suffering . if someone hurts you just remember they did it because they were hurting and once you understand their hurting because everyone knows what its like to hurt you ll be able to move forward . also , don t demonize those who do drugs because they are doing them out of pain . so many different variations of pain but its always about pain nevertheless

now","480804":"yeah , i ve noticed that usually when someone has hatred i mean like extremist type hatred though , not sure if that was her from something or someone it s probably because they can

both do it , but it doesn t matter what other people do . . . i m just not going to do that . just because your friend jumps off a cliff , does that mean so will you ?","480807":"the stars . it doesn t matter what kind of day i had or if im in a rush , when im outside in the dark i always have to take a second look up at all the stars . all the stress just instantly goes away . it makes oxygen feel more crisp . for me , its the most beautiful , comforting , and peaceful moment .","480808":"never have never will . i cant force anyone to like me . even if i like someone , theres a chance they wouldn t like me they could end up liking one of my friends . if my friend liked the same person as i did , i would turn into their wingman instead . its not my choice who people should and shouldnt be with . also , you shouldn t claim people like they are a prize or something .","480809":"hey ! my january was actually kind of an anxiety rollercoaster . the uncertainty of everything . the unknown

anyone who s unsure with themselves . they get easily effected by anyone who dislikes or disagrees with them . it s causing so many people to start growing insecurities because of someone else s insecurities . we need to stop comparing ourselves to everyone . no wonder so many people feel like its them vs the world .","480820":"i have a slight obsession with skulls . . .","480821":"i

feel like literally everyone thats alive can agree with this","480838":"it honestly depends on what country you re looking at . japanese are not afraid of death like at all so their suicide rate is high for all ages . but in america , theres been an increase in up committing suicide since , but since ages between have been pretty steady , little increase and little bit of decrease . they honestly dont have statistics for just under .","480839":"the statistics of people who are truly insane and truly aren t afraid of death is about i used to study this but even people on death row you can watch on youtube start to fear death once they are put in prison . a lot of them say they deserve to die they turn to a religion because they admit they are afraid .","480840":"i think people gain more fear once they hit the age . under people usually feel fearless , maybe even careless . haven t you watched a kid run around play ? its like they always have some sort of death wish . think about how rebellious teenagers can get . they are always so anxty that they dont give a fu . ck and thats why there s quite a lot of sui . cides of young people . kids are super resilient and can endure quite a lot of pain . once you become an adult you start to feel more of the pain and you become afraid of all it . afraid of death , losing someone , the pain that might come from right before you die . the difference with adults is they just become more cautious its not because they lost their fear of death . especially the elders , why do you think majority of people that fill up a church are our older generation ? because they are afraid of death and want comfort about what comes after . its the same reason why parents have become bubble wrapping sheltering helicopters . . they are afraid of losing anything . we live in a society that created a fear of death . if nobody is afraid to die then all these multimillion dollar companies , corporations , hospitals , pharmaceuticals , ect will lose power .","480841":"boomwinkle","480842":"the girls were so cute ! he actually did look like a pig ! makeup artists are getting really impressive .","480843":"i hope you have a beautiful

soul . we all got our own monsters lingering inside us , the heart beat is the evil knocking asking to be let out and be free . they say that the world is evil and full of sin , and we were born innocent , but the world s air is what we breath to keep us alive , water makes us healthy , and land that keeps us dry . the only reason we have destruction , is because we re all dark . the world is saving us , we re not close to saving earth . to keep us sane , our mind tells us to do selfless acts towards everything and everyone , but we feed off pain and struggles . some have hungry eyes and starving souls , chose to hurt others to make them full . as others , hurt themselves to hurt others around them . when the rest lie to themselves to the point they believe they are okay . when in the end , they need to stop trying to save others and the world , and save them from themselves . the world is easy , simple , and full of life . human nature is complex , complicated , and unexplained . nothing is explained , nothing is understood , everything is still put in question , no matter how much faith you have in it . the voice in your head , isn t a conscious it s a monster . the subconscious dreams are the truth behind what is masked over when your awake . the daily image of being perfect and angel like , is just part of the imagination . a strive , the motivation to keep hell locked up . prisoner of our own imagination , creation of heaven keeps people hopeful . we re just ghosts playing our role again in a reality that we perceive to be real , but the demon already made the thoughts , actions , and reasons before , that s why everything happens for a reason . the people who don t believe that , and believe that they have control are unleashed demons making their first rounds before they create a new image and perceive a reality . there s never good or bad , angel or demon . just bad and bad , demon and demon . you can t run and hide . you have no where to go . our lives revolve in going in circles , you will end right where you started . let out the monster once in awhile , realize they are there , because that s the only friend you will have in the very end . lady boometh","480925":"can you spot ash looking like tweaker ?","480926":"hey ! i am doing great ! how are you doing ? i ended up doing my makeup but it s weird i look better in person than i
