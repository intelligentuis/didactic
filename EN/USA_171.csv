  This week with Lauren - 2/2
  
  I think this was the longest week of my life. Initially wanted to take this week to relax and kinda slow down and process a lot of things that have been going on lately, but then more things ended up happening that I needed to process, so that didn’t exactly happen. I went for a last minute trip to Chattanooga, TN (re: the aesthetically pleasing bed pic) to get away for a little bit and get some space from everything/everyone. Many tears were shed, many headaches were had, and it’s definitely not the end of all of that yet, but hey I’ve really been through it all at this point. With great friends and a great therapist, I’ll be fine 💖

And this is why I was always getting noticed by justin 😂
  
  That rumir lasted up until like I was 15 and I tweeted about it but it still says we used to date on the internet. The other one was about another popular youtuber at the time who we have hung out with and done some videos and even a concert with was ryan beatty, which christina my oldest sister confirmed it wasnt real for me.

   Say, ur friend got mad at you bc of the things she thought you didn’t like eventho you didn’t say such words. Like, she misunderstood what you said and never let you speak up or clear things up. Now she hasn’t replied to ur last text. Would u text her again and make her understand or just let it be?
  ","
  I would just let it be for now, she may just need some time to calm down and get over the situation. Which hurts in your case because you want her to talk and be friends again but sometimes things like this happens and you need to understand that not everything is going to be an easy fix and you can just go back to being how it was before. As long as you're truly sorry and apologized for your wrong doing that all you can really do. If she chooses to not accept that, see u mean it and igbores u then you simply move on till she's ready to come around again if not well at least you're not worried about it

   Would you support AskFM creating a friends only option where you could choose to receive questions or your page only being seen from those you follow or approve? Or do you like the all public discussion platform?

  I feel like asking.FM should allow you to block someone from seeing ur profile not like everyone but a specific account that's bothering you etc. But let others still socialize with u until you block them then they can't see anything u post. Because now even if u block someone all it does is block them from liking or sending questions but they can still see your entire profile and what you post

   Why were you homeschooled ? Was there something wrong with your local school?
  ","
  No there was nothing wrong with the schools. However when michael our oldest brother and the oldest child of my siblings was young our mom, found an interview where a 14 year old girl  was talking about college and how she was just soaring and excelling. My mom was fascinated by her story,  but was a bit wary of the idea because homeschooling wasn't very common at the time in the early 90s. My mom however went to public schools and did not enjoy her experience at all. Due to bullying, and skipping grades she would sometimes be bored and waiting for the lecture to be over with. So she wanted us to advance at our own pace instead of being rushed or forced. And be able to skip grades if that was what was best for us. Her and dad decided to home school all of us from k-12 and developed their own curriculum which focused on Latin, greek, classic literature, catholic faith and critical thinking. Mom wanted us to have to learn to think for ourselves, to be curious and love learning, and to have strong moral compasses. she signed  us up for every activity possible in our  area- swim team, musical theatre, basketball, gymnastics, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, karate, and many more. We all grew up to be a loud, vibrant bunch. We were very well “socialized” and had a lot of friends. Most people didn’t guess we were homeschooled when they met us because of our social and people skills.
  

  To this day, we all count our homeschool experience as one of the greatest tools in our lives and careers. Because of homeschooling, we have had a lot of free time to learn instruments, practice singing and harmonizing, and write songs. Homeschooling gave us the space to be free to be ourselves. Being unique and independent was highly valued in the Cimorelli household; we were not told to “fit into the mold.” This ideal shaped our music and decisions for years to come

  We grew up on the same street together. And attended musical theater in the summer, which my mom made all of us participate in. And my mom wanted us to make friends because we were homeschooled and that started with the neighbors. So Elli and I shortly became friends after a few conversations, and then gradually I was introduced to her brothers as well.

   What's Your Horoscope?
  ","
  Financially, things seem to be going great for you right now, Leo, and therefore you could plan to make an investment in your home. If you already own one, you might decide to remodel or redecorate. If not, then you could just haunt realtors' offices for the next few weeks. This is a good time to turn your energy toward improving your own space. Go for it and have fun!

   What's your opinion on horse racing? Have you been to a horse race or watch it on tv? Do you think it's cruel to whip a horse, use it for entertainment? Is it unfair that so much money is used on horses when there's so many poor people?
  ","
  I don't really have any opinion considering I don't know much about it.  I never watched or been to one, but I have seen a pig race before as a small child at a local animal park. I don't think horses should be whipped because they dont know what's right or wrong, they're an animal with a soul but no voice to be heard when they're in pain or whatever. And sadly even if there's poor people you still have those people who can help out but choose not to.

  So some ""Sophia"" chick has a crush on my cutie and my love and keeps attempting to flirt with him attempting to break us apart. Amd thinks we won't last. Funny thing she fails to realize is his family, him and I all know she's fake. And unlike you I have known his family since I was 12 and his brother is like my older brother and I adore his family. There hardly has been any fights, and we actually talk things out when a problem comes in the way and compromise or come up with a solution. And I love him to death as well as his son ian. And the ""happiness"" we now get to experience together so I don't think anything is going to happen tonus for awhile honey

  This week with Lauren - 1/19
  
  I feel like I’m finally starting to level out a bit in life. I’ve been trying to achieve balance and peace for so long but I’ve consistently been anxious and overwhelmed and stressed pretty much all the time. Last week I talked about implementing new routines which I’ve been doing for about 3 weeks now and this week I feel like they’re actually working! I think I got the night routine down and my week structure down, but still working on a morning routine that works for me. The biggest thing I think that’s helping me is taking Monday and Wednesday night as self care nights. I don’t look at my phone, and I take the whole night from like 7:00 on to do whatever kind of relaxing/enjoyable things I wanna do. Not laying in my bed watching Netflix tho, stuff like doing a face mask, clean my room, taking a shower, dancing, songwriting, whatever it is just putting myself first in that time. Knowing that I have those nights coming up makes me more relaxed in general too cause if I’m feeling overwhelmed or stressed I’m like ok well I know on Monday and Wednesday I get to relax, so there’s a light at the end of this tunnel 🙏🏼 I’m also adopting a new mindset that’s like I can only do what I can do. I don’t need to do everything everyday. I identify what the most important things are to do for the week and then plan them in and if I don’t have time for them, I plan them into next week. I used to feel like the more I do, the more worth I have as a person, but that’s not true at all. At this point I would rather be relaxed and fulfilled, instead of doing as many things as I possibly can and then burning out all the time. Realizing too that when I’m relaxed and feel balanced, I do better work and I’m more creative so really it’s a win win. Also I released a music video yesterday for my song #BrownEyedBoys go check it out if you haven’t seen it! (Link in my bio) Thanks for coming to my ted talk 🙏🏼

   How would you react if your kids or future kids had bad grades in their report card
  ","
  Try to figure out the reason as to why first then enforcement punishment if needed. Bevause bad grades doesn't define the kids misbehaving or simply being lazy and refusing to do work..sometimes they have an undetected learning disability or something interfering with them to get a good grade etc.

   So you don't like Apple Pie (since it's both), but I never understood the hate/dislike for both ""Wings"" (not sure if it's your song of Little Mix's) and ""Believe It"", I wonder why?
  ","
  I don't like pie or apples so yes no apple pie for me. Wings was an original song we wrote years ago taking footage from believe it and writing a ""thank you"" song to the cimfam. I just feel like the video could have had a deeper meaning as well as the song. And none of us like believe it because it was a song that we didnt write but was given to us from the record label to perform, sing etc. And promo everywhere. The reason why is because if you listen to the lyrics its telling you to believe it but doesn't explain what you are really supoose to believe its a blank unfinished message...

  Two police offers were at the doughnut shop ordering coffee and jelly filled doughnuts. When one of the officers had to fart, so he ripped a big one.

  Christian is someone I met when I first moved to nashville and didn't really know anyone or anything. We started talking at a church we both attended and shortly became friends. His parents suggested he should ask me to prom, which he did. We shortly started dating later on but it just didn't work out at the time and we went different ways until a few months ago we started talking as friends again. I'm in a media relationship as of right now
  
  Tristen is my bestfriend, i known him for a few years and we gotten to know each other and became very close we are in a private relationship which means no one actually knows we are together.
  "
918410,"
   Oh that's pretty cool there did you run into some creeps or anything also meant to ask you this earlier are you and Rachael still going to do a collab?

  Never really had an issue with creeps or anything as of now. Just people not respecting privacy and interfering with our personal lives. And I plan on doing so, I know lisa and her were working on something as well.
  "
918411,"
   Is it wrong to have a crush Amy know that I would never win her heart and that I don't deserve someone as amazing as she is.
  ","
  I mean people look up to their idols and all. But right now she's not worried about being in a relationship and is focusing on her self. Maybe in the future when she's ready she would consider dating a fan. 😊

  You can choose to ignore hate from others. But most of the time if you have a desire for anything, you mostly do everything you can to contain that desire or get that.

  I don't really have a favorite crop top .... I just like to wear them with a Cami tee underneath BC I don't like ahowing skin off right now. Mostly being BC of the scar on my stomach and the fact I'm trying to contonue being a positive role model on younger children who looks up to me as well. Don't want younger children walking around in crop tops now do we? Also trying to be conservative as well.

  I feel I should clear these up real quick:
  
  - the photos I post on here are either old and have been posted before/saved onto my laptop/ phone or ones I just posted
  
  - sometimes I post edits others have made bc i enjoy their artwork amd creativity
  
  - I never once said Christian was a bad guy, I said the relationship just didn't work out at the time, and we just needed to take a different path in life for awhile until we crossed again
  
  - we spent three years apart from eachother and doing things we loved. As well as leaening what needs to be fixed with ourselves and our friendships/relationships
  
  - acid rain is not about christian and never will be
  
  - the video christian posted about prom and us dating was privately by my request ( we know I hate people talking about my relationships and tend to be a private until I feel the timing is right)
  
  - Tristen is Derek's brother someone I have trusted for a long time.
  
  - he has a son named ian which lost his real mother in a car crash and his twin (I called him my son because I adore him).
  
  -understand I was calling Tristen mine before we even had a relationship because we were really good friends
  
  - a media coverage relationship is what I am in where the media makes it seem I'm with someone but I'm not and could be single, dating, etc to someone else. Which is how you get attention and publicity and all that.
  
  - I do not appreciate people coming on here accusing me of being something I am not because you do not know the full story or facts because I only release what I choose to. Most of this is for privacy concerns.
  
  - do not share my account or whatever with anyone please xx

  1. Build a life for yourself that is full of things you love/important to you - if you don't have that much going on, add some things in so you have things to focus on.
  
  2. Get comfortable being in your head with your thoughts and your feelings so you don't feel the need to talk to other people all the time to escape yourself.

   How do you cope of being a shy person?
  ","
  Stop thinking it's something you have to change! It's not a bad thing. You don't have to talk to everyone! There's nothing wrong with that. If you are shy, your strength is gonna be building deep friendships with a couple of people you trust and being able to really listen and be there for them which is just as VALUABLE if not more than being able to easily talk to anyone.

   I only get £500 a week on benefits and £200 of that a week goes on food which leaves me only £300 spending money per a week. Do you agree that I should be given more? Because I had to save up three WHOLE weeks for the Valve Index!
  ","
  The point of benefits is to receive money that helps you out with things such as rent, electric, food etc. And making sure you have insurance as well. To take care of your basic needs. Not just money to be handed out to buy games or things like a pet dolphin in your backyard. And honestly if I had 300 dollars left over every week that is MORE than enough to cover my rent, electric, and whatever else. UNLESS u live in some really expensive house but in that case you shouldn't be even getting benefits then.

  Because when the rash happens the truck was hit head on and pushed the hood and grill up, the airbag went off and hit her hand and stomach... She later texted nicholas who is a emergency responder for the ___ county fire department & her husband that she just got in a bad car crash, the truck was wrecked and the air bag hit her hand then a specific separate text saying and my stomach. She was scared, taken to the hospital with nick. But still scared and having flashbacks that night of it. Requested time off to recover but a friend bought her baby over to spend time with christina and she said back to her roots, and then she just became depressed and took more time off from the book signing and all... And then concerts came around and she would break down crying trying to get through her speeches and during the night we met would cry
  "
918817,"
   Is it something with Nick? Because she can conceive the baby, just not keep it. I know that my sister can't have kids and she's lost 4.
  ","
  I think it was related to the car crash. ...
  "
918818,"
   Oh my heart goes out to Christina & Nick 😪
  ","
  Can I just state this... The video isn't really realeased until tomorrow some countries will obviously see it before others. But since you see the premiere and you know know whats been happening behind the closed doors and why christina has been away, why she's been taking time to herself, and why we all been emotional for the past months and why she's been crying on tour giving her speeches and specifically during the night we met. Please do not spread hate and choose what you say very carefully to ANY of us but mostly CHRISTINA & NICK. This was her first child, that she so desperately wanted in her life and been praying for. I know many people don't understand what its like due to age but its really hard loosing a baby of any stage... Or a child for that matter. So please just spread nothing but support and love for them and if you have nothing nice to say then don't say anything.

   Is it bad to always care too much about other people?
  ","
  No, but it's really hard on you if you find yourself only thinking about how other people feel about things and not ever making choices based on how you feel and what you wanna do.  It's also very draining taking on other people's problems bc you think you have to fix them for them. Realize that people can take care of themselves and they should. Everyone needs to learn how to work through their own feelings and deal with their own problems. You can help people with their problems  if you want to, but it's not your job to male other people feel okay. That's their job. And it's your job to make sure you feel okay 💛

  * 8 years old I started a career because my sister wanted to be in a band

  * few weeks later a manager from london wanted us to perform for her
  
  *she had us drive down to la to perform for her coworkers at island records
  
  * we got signed immediately and moved to malibu
  
  *while under this management label we have done many things and all such as working with songwriters and believe it not keshas mom
  
  *however in 2015, they tried to changed us into something we would never be and we felt drained and not wanting to do musoc anymore
  
  * we broke away from our label and went independent, moved to nashville
  
  *the older girls moved into their own apartment together while Dani and I lived in the family house
  
  *we later released our first album and many EPs later : up at night
  
  *did many tours over those years which included a European tour and south america tour

  Hard.

  ","
  Dani left the band, to go on in life and pursue other things that interest her and its just hard because I haven't really gotten the time to actually cry because I had to stay strong for her because shes my baby sister and I have to be strong for her. But now that the news is out and we done the video, and know that next weeks video is like her final work for who knows when its all hitting us hard because we dont want her to leave, course we will still get to see her because shes our sister and all but its just hard spending 10 years together working every single day together and then it all disappears and all you have left are the memories. And its going to hit me harder when performancing and realize that I can't turn and do stupid stuff that only her and I do when performing. Like in fall back she sings looked to my right and couldn't believe to pass on the lyrics to my part but then throws like a imaginary football for me to catch.  Or will do the little little dances to I know you know it or just random little sassy comments and that.

  Not sure if I still have the sweet paragraph type in me... But I'm going to give it a shot. I heard about you for years, but never who you actually were till two years ago. At first I thought you would never even be interested in even. Being friends with me yet alone a relationship because we were total opposites. After seeing what you been through, I just wanted you to get treated the way you deserved to be, after seeing you broken, hurt and devastated over and over again. I decided to aim for the buses and take the risk of getting to know you and spend one on one quality time together. I became the friend who never wanted to leave your side and just wanted to try my hardest to put even a smile on my face, and the more we got closer and the more we became friends I quickly fell for you. I was scared, I wanted to run and I didn't want to get in way to deep insane there was no escape. I had my walls built up and a lock on my heart for everyone to keep out as I have been healing from previous committed relationships myself and heartbroken over and over again as well. I didn't want to trust, but you came in like a bullet and made sure that if I was falling you were going to be there to catch me. We started dating around the end of September and have made so many memories together, ones I'll forever cherish as time passes. And so far you have kept your promise, I fell for you and you were right there to catch me. I wasnt really expecting an engagement anytime soon. But then two days ago you got down on your knees and grabbed my hand, asking if I'll forever be yours. I said yes and here we are today. I'm thankful for you, thankful that a guy so amazing like you came into my life at the most unexpected time. A time when I thought I had everything figured out and I could manage everything on my own. Thank you for being here when I'm feeling down, being a shoulder to cry on and for always cheering me on and supporting me through the good and the bad.   I love you and ian so much and always will. Forever my person you will be 💛

   i was seeing something on the band youtube channel is dani leaving you guys wanted to ask you first to clarify
  ","
  Dani has left the band to move on and pursue other dreams and journeys she has had for awhile. And its heartbreaking we know, but sisterhood comes first and we will always be sisters. This wasnt a rushed decision and nothing bad happened. She just wanted something different and we are glad she has been with us for the 10 years as she has done so much and impacted everyone in a positive way. No its not because of her husband this is something she has wanted for a long time. And we supoort her choice and will support her through it. However so much will change, and there will be a blank space and a missing puzzle piece. But Dani will still be involved with the cimfam, either randomly appearing in videos or supporting the new music, or cheering us on from the crowds. We didnt force her or kick her out of the band. And the door will always be open for her to come back if she wants. But the band is not leaving, we are going into 2020 as a five piece. Kinda like it was when we first started youtube then added our brother Michael in for a while then Dani joined in. ... So please no hate comments about any of this and understand that we are all hurting and upset because none of us wanted this and like dani says in before octobers gone, ""maybe sometimes things just have to end"".
  
  But she will still be active  on social media  and if you want to continue supporting us as a five piece thank you but you can also support Dani and follow her journey @ daniandemmyn on youtube

   Black Blink was the only one I seen . He said Emmyn stole Dani from Cimorelli. But I replied and said no he didn't she is her own person & still young  also wants to explore more things in life
  ","
  I just been the one carrying all this for the past few months. She trusted me to come to me to me first about it. And its hard because I haven't had the time to actually realize she's not going to be there to turn to while on stage of something. It hurts me more than the others because me and her were the youngest. Yes shes still around because shes my sister and all, but you got to figure we are the two youngest, we do everything together. And while in the band growing up we also had our own channel together were we would rehearse for days just to perfect a song... She is the spice to the sugar & spice show. She will forever be the twin (not actual) of me and it will always be a dauren thing. Which im not sure if we will even perform the older songs anymore. Because fall back won't be the same....

  - I did my first ever music video by myself for my song ""pressure""

  I grew up with cats and dogs but I just don't like knowing how to interact with them properly. I was attacked by a friends dog when I was younger, it was minor but left me forever like scared. Because I had my hair up in pigtails and the dog started to bite and pull on them and as my friends were trying to get the dog off, others joined in. And I was pretty traumatized for awhile, however my brothers and parents (family house were I lived for like 2 1/2 years after moving to nashville) own a dog named jessie and I sort of gotten used to her being around (she used to always be by me and I would have to dart from my room to the driveway and so on). And then my oldest sister/ birthday twin christina and my brother in law nicholas have a dog named frankie who likes to lick your hand ... He's OK but I still believe he wants to eat me. And then with cats I just don't like them because they scratch and charles and Penelope (Lisa's cats) like to jump all over and stuff

  There's this girl that fakes me and like my whole entire family. Or people who have/were associated with me. She also faked sabrina carpenter as well and like has 20+ accounts still. Anyway I got some to be removed awhile ago, which she just made new accounts. And then reported my old account and it got suspended, she lies. Manipulates people, cusses, and just overall gives a bad reputation to those she pretended to be, and treats their fans like trash. She dated my boyfriends brother and basically lied, manipulated, and so on while dating him, then once we figured it all out she just blocks you on her account, and continues to stalk you and send hate and so on.

  I actually like chad. Max is okay he's more on the quiet side
  "
920660,"
   You might have to think about doing as a 5 piece. Dani was probably not happy because Emmyn & his band wasn't there
  ","
  Idk. One of us are bound to leave sometime and its going to happen eventually. But we don't know who. Lisa tried to break the band up before, we went to group therapy. I tried leaving, multiple times only to be told to sit down and talk it out, there was rumors last year about christina leaving once she got married or pregnant
  "
920661,"
   I think it was early that they are married. They are together for a year and they are so  young. Okay Christina could be the same age as Dani when she met Nick but they were a couple for like 7-8 years and then got married
  ","
  Kath and max were together for a year as well, and lisa and chad
  "
920662,"
   And you always will be close to each other
  ","
  But I feel like Dani may leave the band soon as well... She just doesn't seem as interested in things anymore. And there was a few times on tour were she didnt want to cooperate with us or sing
  "
920663,"
   I wouldn't go that far. I thought things would change after Christina got married but she's still there to support you all and the Cimfam. I think Kath & Lisa will be the same as her
  ","
  Lisa is the only one I'm really close to still
  "
920664,"
   I know it's a hard you don't want to say too either of them. Because that might push Dani away more

  "
920665,"
   Okay.
  ","
  😙😙
  "
920666,"
   This is my opinion. There's a thing most of you live by. And that's wait til after marriage. I don't think Emmyn couldn't wait.  I might be very here in saying. But she could end up pregnant & if anything happened Dani would be left holding the baby.

  Basically we feel like the whole thing was rushed and he's taken advantage of dani.  Meaning that dani was in a very vulnerable place a year ago with still going through the heartbreak to finding out who she was. As you know she had a breakdown because the hate becane to much as well. She was starting to get better. Kallen, our childhood bestfriend actually loved dani and that is why he moved and lived with us for a year because he tried chasing after dani. He confessed his feelings for her back home in california for christinas wedding amd for awhile it was always about kallen and them hanging out. And she even wrote as a caption (saying lisa made her) were she was inside kallens tesla, that she was going marry kallen one day and didnt care what any of us had to say. Which dad commented under it ""hey now young lady  with the cool face emoji"". And everything seemed fine. Then around this time is when emmyn was contacting her, blowing up her phone while she was trying to enjoy time with us. Like he was literally being obsessive. And she suddenly started seeing emmyn as well. Kallen moved back to California and really hasnt said much to us since then. That was just the start of it, notice at the reception we did back in Tennessee kallen was by me or arielle the entire time. Kallen also posted that he missed his wifey and someone tagged emmyn in it asking how does he feel about it and emmyn said he does not approve and was upset. Danielle turned 18, and a lot of you know we do EVERYTHING together and always been the closest because sugar & spice and we were like the twins. She moved in with emmyn & his family. You think she would've moved in with me and amy? Because we always shared a room together growing up, it was Lisa, me and her. Then when we moved to Tennessee it was only me and her as the only daughters left in the house. So that's where it kinda seemed weird. Then she like stopped coming around to do family stuff with us or hangout ( we only see her if its like a band meeting, a big function like a birthday or we are on tour now), and that's another weird thing. Because Danielle and I used to hang out all the time and now its just amy and I who lives together and hangs out together (sometimes lisa). Also given her age and seeing how she changed so much (rebellious like) it just seems like its not really going to last.. And its rushed and she's just going with everything emmyn wants because she's afraid to be hurt or whatever again. Or like he wants ties to dani for some reason. And lately it just seems like the Dani we know isn't really there ...
  "

   I just seen Lisa's posts talking about her ring. At least her and Katherine are doing it the right way and taking there time. And Christina did as well
  ","

   They do quite a lot of pop covers too, like Madonna... yeah not saying don't, just do it with your eyes open and know what you're in for. The Texan rock gal Rosie Flores said she could never maintain a relationship cause she was on the road all the time. She's nearly 70 now (looks 30 years younger)

  Once again a post I shouldn't even have to make but sadly I do. ( ignore the language on this as it was a screenshot from a fan). But as some of you know a few weeks ago we were doing the golden ticket rewards. Which is were you received a golden ticket with the merch you brought from that time period to be redeemed for a prize. The prizes included: a skype call from one of us, a follow from our band accounts and an exclusive poster. Their was also a glitch in the system and we were behind on shipping things out as well, which our team and us have been working on. Anyway the exclusive poster was given out as a reward to many, which may have not made it so exclusive and fans instantly started to become upset and addressed their concerns... But some addressed their concerns in a way that was very harsh and made fun of the poster and the design claiming it was cheaply made, a waste of money etc. But little did they know the story behind it and just kept putting down the poster. Danielle cimorelli ( our youngest sister) who is only 19. Has became interested in graphic design lately and she's still learning how to do things involving that. We let her do the design of the poster and she thought it would be fun to create a poster out of it and expand her skills as well. Danielle has also done the header and designs for our youtube and our tour announcement, and even helped designed my orange merch as well as emmyns and max's. And I feel incredibly blessed that she has even offered to help with these things. As for a learner I think she does a great job, and her designs are really cute and matches with the aesthetic. However, I know have to deal with a very upset and hurt sister who just wanted to do something for thousands of people to enjoy and have fun creating it as well. ... This is why you must consider what you're about to post! Because we see a lot of those things even if you think we may not. And twitter has always been a toxic place for dani to be on that she stopped coming on completely and had to make a second account. Its sad that our fandom that is suppose to be a positive uplifting community has turned into something wrong don't even associate with. So I ask if you claim to be a fan of ours hut constantly say negative things about any of us, remove yourself from the fandom ... And don't associate with those trying to be positive as well in it.... Im just extremely disappointed and when it comes to.someone I care about like my sister. I feel I have to defend them. But please change your behavior and learn how to think about what you're saying before posting it and hurting someone...

  Using this as a space ) but FOR THE CLUELESS PEOPLE WHO JUST DONT GET IT ! PLEASE READ:
  
  Its really annoying I even have to post something like this for starters, but some people just don't know how to be respectful, use their brain, or even read for that matter. 🤦🏻
  
   @TNMORZ
  
  and I have been dating since September, minus whatever rumors you may hear because of media and certain people invading privacy and twisting things around. But anyway I'm getting tired of seeing certain animals questions being sent to
  
   @WhySoManyTaken
  
  who is tristen's half brother. Consisting of things like ""would he date me"" and so on, no he won't because I'm dating his brother, never had romantic feelings for him, and he has his own girlfriend. Stop being those type of people who try to break people up because you're unhappy with your life. Its also annoying how anytime I even mention Tristen you guys like to point out he's gay, I'm better looking. No offense but I think Tristen is adorable, He's good enough for me, and no he's not gay. As for the anons in my inbox telling me to break up with him and date them : NEVER im perfectly content with my relationship and I don't date just anyone. I have to feel comfortable and actually know you for starters. And for the anons who have a weird obsession with jonah marais... That's never going to happen, jonah is the exact boyfriend of one of my sisters and he hurt her pretty badly. Yes he may have grown up, but I will never date him or anything. And jonah also has a girlfriend who he's been with for years as well ( send hate to me for speaking the truth iDC anymore) her name is taytum Dahl NOT maggie or madison whoever is claiming that they're together GROW UP 🙃 that is all

  This week with Lauren - 12/7
  
  A couple days late, sorry lads lol tbh just been trying to catch my breath these last couple days!!!! Got home from the last stop of the Believe In You tour on Saturday night and let me tell you I have never slept more than I have in the last 2 days!!!!! This has been the most challenging and hectic month/2 months of maybe my entire life. It‘s like just when you think everything will calm down, there’s something else !!! Did not foresee all of this. Been working with my therapist a lot on using healthy coping strategies to deal with stress and big emotions. Definitely don’t always employ these strategies, but things like being honest with myself, taking time to process my thoughts and feelings (and allowing myself to feel those feelings and have those thoughts), and setting boundaries that I need to keep myself healthy (mentally and physically) even though it might inconvenience other people have been coming in clutch. I think the holidays/the end of the year is pretty hard for a lot of people. A lot of you guys have your finals for school right now, being around family can be really stressful, or trying to celebrate when you’ve lost a loved one or come from a broken home, or even just having your own personal struggles and not being able to enjoy what’s supposed to be the happiest time of year can be really hard. You’re not alone guys. And you don’t have to pretend like everything’s fine when it’s not. It’s okay to feel exactly however it is that you feel and there’s nothing wrong with you for feeling that way ❤️ p.s. the last video is from something really special we filmed ;)

   I don't think your life is falling apart. It's just your mind telling you that you need to pay attention to yourself and focus on the bigger picture.

  Yeah, I just hate that I'm that type of person who simply can not just relax when I need it because I feel like the work has to get gone. Or I have to be the peacemaker all the time and people please because i dont want others to be sad and uoset if it doesnt get done. I always try to put my everything into things and it wears me out
  "

   Well, I think you should start with telling yourself that your mental health is important and something you need to put first. Your job can come second or third. It is not more important than your self care.

  I think we are all sort of just worn out and wanting a break. Luckily (not in a bad way) tonight is our last show and we can just go home and spend time time with our family and enjoy the holidays. And I think I need to schedule some therapy meetings as well. I don't like feeling like my life is falling apart and I can't grasp onto anything but just sit there and feel sad

  Actually it wasn't because my old house completely burned down in the wild fireworks, the whole street was totally destroyed even the park that we visited a lot through out the years and filmed music videos at.

Learn that those things have happened for a reason and it has shaped your life into what it is today. Yeah we wish to go back and change it but we really can't. And we just need to move on and try to make better choices and that in the present to have a better future

  Not exactly pricey, its just hard narrowing down at times what would be the perfect gift that would actually be unique and used or cherished etc. And what they don't already have something similar if.

And then with older siblings that are married, engaged, in a relationship you also have to think about their partners and what would work there as well

  Not like face to face but however loll. I was in LOVE with justin bieber as a child. And I was crying when I heard her was getting married to Hailey ... Like play that girl should be me or that should be me. Because LITERALLY. I remember one time he commented on our pray cover we did and said we did a good job and that. Then when were signed to universal we had to attend the never say never movie premiere and I was dying... Also it was my first ""red "" carpet experience and it was so awkward because you have to like stand there and go in like a 360 rotation in the same pose so everyone gets their media coverage. Then a few years ago while on tour we actually all got to go see him in concert for the first time.

  I started releasing my solo music the beginning of this year (well, December 28th, 2018) and I had no idea what to expect from you guys. You guys are so supportive of our Cimorelli music, but I wasn’t sure what the reaction would be to my music. I was so scared of putting myself out there. Especially with my song “Running”. That was the first song I released. Not sure why I decided to start with the most vulnerable one 🙃 I remember when I announced it was coming out I was soooo nervous and for that whole week before it came out I could barely eat. Not only was it terrifying anticipating what people’s reactions might be, but at this point in my life I was a very private person. I didn’t like sharing struggles, or vulnerabilities with people. Especially not to strangers on the internet. I wrote this song when I was 17 with the sole intention of expressing my feelings about the situation I was in. I had no idea how to produce a song and not much of an idea how to write a song. My thought when I finished it was “There is no way I am ever realizing this. This is waaayy too personal.” 3 years later, my baby was about to come into the world. Every song on my EP #Orange came about the same way. The only thought I had while writing these was this: What is the most accurate way I can communicate the way that I am feeling right now? The response I got to all of these songs was OVERWHELMING. Especially to Running. It’s so humbling to see the support you guys have shown 😭 beyond grateful for you all and I’m SO excited to see what this next year brings 💜 also shoutout to Mexico 😘

  This week with Lauren - 11/23
  
  Wow I’m actually posting 2 weeks in a row ! Who would’ve thot ! lol almost every pic in this is from last weekend bc this week was really hard!!! So much has been piling up on me and I wasn’t prepared for it. Didn’t have the routines / systems / schedules in place to be able to deal with so much. I pretty much just withdrew into myself and tried to make the world go away. Didn’t work that well bc the world still exists 🙃 still working through this slump tbh but I felt a lot better today after spending some time honestly connecting with some people yesterday and talking about what was going on and also being real with myself and talking to myself about what was going on lol seems like a no-brainer, but I do have a tendency to not check in with myself and see what’s going on, especially when I’m not feeling good. If you’re going through a hard time right now, which I know a lot of you are, just know I’m right there with you and we’ll get through it. ❤️ I wanna say thanks to everyone who supported our new merch launch / golden ticket week! I put my heart and soul into all of it and it’s been our most successful drop to date and that is really encouraging to see so thank you 🙌🏼 also thank you to everyone who came to our shows on this tour. It’s been such a blessing to be able to share this experience with you all ❤️ you guys always give me so many reasons to be grateful especially when I really need it 💜💜💜

   What happened with management and venue workers. What did they do bad?
  ","
  Basically they knew we were coming because they're the ones who sold and provided the tickets and even had the poster of the show up. Our name was even written on the theater light thing etc. They knew we had a show that day as well. A mutal friend who works with my sisters boyfriend chad gilbert who is on new found glory (He was on tour as well but had to fly home due to a family emergency so please keep in your prayers and thoughts). Booked the show for us and we even had payed to use their venue.provided all the information they would need and so on. So we arrive to the venue, its freezing cold. We also had a street team that was given early access passes and special rewards for promoting us/ spreading word etc. We had to do soundcheck and make sure our equipment and everything was set up, lights worked, tech was all good. We all had to show IDs individually, like why? How do you not know who the band is and when theyre performing etc? Then they refused to let us inside the venue for like 15+ minutes left us standing there in the cold. When they finally let us in we got everything set up and sorted with the equipment and so on. Meet and greet came around and I believe the doors weren't open on time as well the security was being really rude to members of the fandom that were getting their turns to meet us and pictures etc. Telling fans to hurry up as they were handing out letters or whatever. So I was getting really ticked off and just wanted to call them out on it. I feel bad for how many of them were treated like that and its poor training on the theaters behalf.

  ","
  This week with Lauren ✨
  
  lol again, this is more like the last ~ few weeks ~ with Lauren. Been such a crazy month !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well really a crazy last 2 months. We have been working SO HARD trying to get this year all finished out for you guys. Planning our best videos, trying a lot of new things, finishing up our TOUR, coming out with our winter merch line, jewelry line, and BOOK Believe In You !!!! In the midst of all of thisss I’ve been trying to cultivate balance in my life 🕊 it’s been difficult for sure bc I have a tendency to be a bit of a workaholic 😅 I’m like oh yeah I can do everything ! I can stay up late ! I can wake up early ! I can ignore my friends ! And myself ! And literally everything else ! But .... that ain’t it. I reposted a quote on my story today that sums it up real well. It talks about doing your best and how you do your best when you take care of yourself. You do your best when you are healthy and happy. Doing your best is not running yourself into the ground til you can barely function. Trying to accept that. The biggest thing I’ve been trying to change is making the choice to do things for myself even if it means sacrificing something else. Like going to bed when I know I need more sleep, being 5 minutes late when I need to grab something I forgot instead of just going without it, canceling plans when I need a night to myself. Bc when life gets so busy, you’re going to have to sacrifice something and I am NOT sacrificing myself. Neither should you. The world will keep turning and you will be fine if you don’t do every last thing people expect of you and you take the time you need to take care of yourself instead. 💜

  No like I said none of the fans are the issue because I hug each and everyone at meet and greets if they ask or want one.

  "
922603,"
   Oh I have just seen why. They wouldn't let u in the venue
  ","
  They asked us CIMORELLI the band who paid to use their venue tonight to individually each show our IDS. Then Wouldn't let us inside the venue to set up or anything for 15+ minutes. And the security was extremely rude to fans during the meet and greet telling them to ""hurry up"" as we were taking pictures, exchanging gifts, letters etc. Which made me want to yeet them. Then people just thinking they're entitled ( not fans) to touch/hug me or for me to hug them etc. HELLOOOO i don't like being touched by strangers or people.I barely know. A fan also has a panic attack as the show was starting, luckily our openers stopped the show completely to make sure she was fine. And theres also so much that was just a disappointment overall. I don't think I will ever do business with them again until they fix these issues with employment,training, and management.
