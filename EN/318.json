how gross i actually am , lmao . honestly , if i m that exhausted i might just quickly wash essential areas of my body with soap and a warm cloth instead of taking a full blown shower .","294151":"i like spicy food a lot , but i can t have too much spiciness because it upsets my stomach . the last time i ate really spicy food , i also got a nosebleed . lmao .","294152":"i try to avoid drama for the most part , but at the same time , i m also mildly interested in drama because i like remaining abreast of what s going on . also , some situations are so ridiculous that they re simply entertaining to follow .","294153":"lol , yes . when i was in middle school , i dressed goth with fishnet shirts , band tee shirts , tripp pants , etc etc .","294154":"i disagree with the notion of allowing your partner to have certain friendships i find that to be rather controlling . ideally , your partner should be making their own conclusions regarding their friendships , even in terms of exes , and even if you disagree you don t exactly have the right to dictate the friendships your partner has .","294155":"this is the current cover of the book i m planning on writing .","294156":"i ve come to the conclusion that one of my friends doesn t actually like me and only puts up with me out of guilt or pity . she never texts me first or asks me to hang out , and we ran into each other while i was out last night , and she only stopped by to say hi for five minutes and then wandered off to hang out with her friend for the remainder of the night . then she left without saying goodbye . i don t know maybe i m just irrational and overthinking it , but i do care about the friendship more than most other things and i m somewhat attached to her . i ve tried not contacting her for a while to see if she contacts me first she never has , and then i give in and text her because i care too much .","294157":"financial stability for both myself my boyfriend . a clean bill of health for both myself my boyfriend . a house and lots of doggos living in that house .","294158":"pap means post a picture .","294159":"i prefer thrillers , dark comedies , and gritty action films . the more gore , the better .","294160":"i love the cool ambience in my bedroom .","294161":"caring for others more than i care about myself . holding onto friendships even if the person doesn t reciprocate feelings or put as much effort into the friendship as i do . i m very money motivated .","294162":"honestly , i don t think that has ever happened to us before . if it has , then it was so far back in the past that i don t remember it . my boyfriend has rejected me holding his hand when he was in a bad mood , but as a general rule , i know not to show physical affection when he s upset because he s not the type of person who feels better with those sorts of things .","294163":"that s so heartwarming and moving . thank you for sharing ! !","294164":"no , definitely not . i m not a fan of frappuccinos to begin with , and it s probably expensive af .","294165":"i don t remember the song , unfortunately . i danced with my boyfriend at my cousin s wedding a few weeks ago .","294166":"sorta , yeah ! ! when i smile really hard or laugh a lot , my dimples come out .","294167":"probably not , lol . even though i m really intrigued by ghosts and the supernatural , i don t think i would be able to handle staying the night in a haunted place because i would freak myself out with anxiety .","294168":"yes , i went to high school with one person who s a famous athlete now .","294169":"some spam number that always calls me every morning doesn t leave a message . i blocked one number that called me every day for two weeks , and then the following day they called from a completely different number . it s absolutely ridiculous .","294170":"pedophilia isn t a sexual orientation .","294171":"i don t even have my own school photo , and it s not as if i would post it anyway .","294172":"to be quite honest , i didn t think i would be alive at the age of . i was surprised when i reached my th birthday , let alone live for another almost years past that . i struggled greatly with mental illness when i was a pre teen and teenager , and i really didn t believe that i would survive to see adulthood . i was incredibly depressed and s icidal .","294173":"my first instinct is to always call my boyfriend . i tell him mostly everything that s going on in my life , and he was a way of calming me down , rationalizing my situations or dilemmas , and motivating me to fix the problem so that it doesn t get worse .","294174":"i don t have any concrete plans for tomorrow . i do want to eventually finish cleaning my room , and i also need to put some clothes in bags for donation . my father is also installing a new air conditioner in the house , but i m not sure if he s doing it today or tomorrow . regardless , i m going to need to help him do it .","294175":"one bad habit that i have that i need to overcome is drinking alcohol , particularly as a way to mask my emotions . i ve developed somewhat of a dependency on alcohol , but i wouldn t consider it a full blown addiction because i m not physically dependent on it . it s something that has actually caused a rift in my relationship and my boyfriend is very worried about me , but i have a habit of having zero self control and acting out on impulse . it s really difficult for me to control myself when alcohol is available .","294176":"if i started a blog , i would probably write about mental health and mental illness . i would try to raise awareness of misconceptions and educate other people on the varying types of mental illnesses to show that they re not scary or unnatural .","294177":"video game , television , and movie soundtracks ! ! i listen to them constantly , particularly when i m working , and it not only calms me down but it also motivates me . right now , i m listening to the harry potter the cursed child soundtrack . also , my favorite soundtracks are from the video game halo , the television show game of thrones , and the video game destiny .","294178":"i m afraid of abandonment thanks , bpd . i don t know if it s considered a phobia , but it s something i ve gone to great lengths to avoid in the past in often irrational ways .","294179":"the closest thing to magic , in my opinion , is music . music can conjure all sorts of emotions for people , and it can make people feel less alone during crucial times of their lives .","294180":"yes , i miss my boyfriend right now . however , he s away with his friends on a camping trip , so i m really happy for him for actually taking time off of work to enjoy himself and see his friends .","294181":"i actually see nothing wrong with that rule , and it makes complete sense to me . i just briefly looked up the origins of the rule , and apparently , it was thought of as far back as .","294182":"i honestly find taxidermy to be incredibly interesting ! ! i ve always wanted to own a taxidermied animal , i find bizarre or odd things like that to be appealing . i believe that taxidermy is fine as long as you re not killing the animal in order to preserve it , so seeing roadkill or an animal passed away in the environment is perfectly ethical to taxidermy .","294183":"i suppose the most obvious hypocritical aspect of my personality is that i care immensely about animals , but i m not a vegan or a vegetarian .","294184":"i don t know if i would consider it an addiction necessarily , but i do somewhat have a dependency on alcohol these days . i don t have much self control when it comes to my drinking , and i drink perhaps too often for my own good .","294185":"the last person i talked to was my coworker last night as she dropped me off home after we went out . she also texted me to tell me she was home afterwards .","294186":"this may be an unpopular opinion , but i believe that morals are primarily subjective . there may be an objective baseline that exists , but it s generally pretty vague and there s a lot of gray area in between . people base their morals on their upbringing and religion , among other things , so each person s idea of what s moral vs immoral will be different .","294187":"people have the right to believe what they want to believe as long as those beliefs don t infringe upon the rights of other groups of people , particularly disadvantaged or oppressed groups . there s nothing inherently wrong with being conservative , it s honestly just the racist , sexist , homophobic , transphobic , etc etc . , conservatives who generally give the political leaning a bad name .","294188":"absolutely . people should be free to express their love and marry whomever they wish regardless of their sexual orientation .","294189":"i just posted one of these , but i m posting them again because i can t get over how beautiful last night was","294190":"haha , yeah that happens to me pretty frequently .","294191":"i spend the majority of my free time on the internet , sadly enough . however , it s what relaxes me the most so i justify it in that respect . sometimes when i get home from work at night , if i have no other responsibilities , i ll log onto askfm , twitter , and facebook on my laptop and browse the internet for an hour or two .","294192":"honestly , i love fake cheese covered snacks , lmaoo . cheez its , cheetos , cheese doodles , etc etc . i rarely eat them , though if i want a snack , usually i ll try to eat some fruit , vegetables , or pretzels hummus .","294193":"follow ! ! ?","294194":"besides religion , i believe that most people learn morals from their family upbringing . what we re taught as young children is integral to our development growing up , especially in terms of morality and our distinction between right and wrong . if we re taught from an early age that something is wrong , then that will carry through to adulthood and eventually be passed onto the next generation of children .","294195":"everyone in my life calls me leigh , so that s my real name at this point .","294196":"hello do you have a question ? ?","294197":"my day feels like it s shorter when i m cleaning , actually . the hours just fly by without a second thought , especially when i set a timer for when i m doing laundry each wash cycle and dry cycle take about minutes each .","294198":"i like both ! ! it ultimately depends on my mood which questions i answer , though . sometimes i only have the attention span for shorter questions , while other times i do enjoy answering the longer questions too .","294199":"i guess i don t have common sense then , lmaoo . in all honestly , i truly don t know when children normally wean from breastfeeding . it isn t something i ve ever looked into .","294200":"they re actually somewhat similar , so i can see where you would get confused . however , bpd is a personality disorder while bipolar disorder is a mood disorder . some other distinctions bipolar disorder is categorized by two phases , mania and depression . bpd , on the other hand , can have a range of emotions however , you can also experience some types of mania and also depression with bpd . bipolar disorder is primarily a chemical imbalance , while bpd is correlated to life events . i . e . , an outburst from someone with bipolar disorder might just be related to their ups and downs , while an outburst from someone with bpd is a direct result of an environmental condition . bpd has a wider range of mood changes , i . e . anxiety , irritability , anger which can borderline on rage , sadness , emptiness , dissociation , etc etc . bipolar disorder , on the other hand , is diagnosed after experiencing at least one two week episode of mania or hypomania and then depression . episodes in bipolar disorder are much more longstanding than episodes in bpd , i . e . bipolar mania episodes can last weeks or longer while episodes in bpd can last from minutes to days . if you have any other questions , please let me know ! !","294201":"surprisingly , i don t have anyone blocked .","294202":"i

friend , so obviously i have positive feelings towards her , lol . cc babycadiexo","294207":"absolutely not , lol . having a mental illness doesn t excuse a person from being a troll or exhibiting any other sort of rude or toxic behavior .","294208":"hello do you have a question ? ?","294209":"no . i only have friends , family , and coworkers added to my facebook .","294210":"scrolling through facebook while i wait for my coworker to pick me up . we re going to the bay for drinks live music .","294211":"i only have the attention span to read one book at a time , sadly . otherwise , i ll get the plot lines and characters confused .","294212":"i don t have a song stuck in my head at the moment because i m listening to the harry potter the cursed child soundtrack .","294213":"skyrim and or fallout .","294214":"no , i absolutely despise the hot weather . i hate feeling like i m suffocated by humidity and sweating .","294215":"no , lmaoo . depression is a medical disorder , an imbalance of the chemicals within one s brain combined sometimes with certain outside environmental causes , such as trauma .","294216":"yes , i use chopsticks whenever i eat sushi .","294217":"uh , probably my knife . lmao . it s actually really cute it s a small knife that flips outward from its sheath and it has a lighthouse engraved on it .","294218":"yes , my boyfriend does call my parents by their first names .","294219":"it was some sort of silver flip phone with a black and white screen , no internet , and limited text messaging and phone minutes , lol . i think i got my first cell phone when i was years old .","294220":"there isn t really anything pressing that i want at the moment . i have a fresh cup of iced coffee sitting next to me , i m listening to music , and i m surrounded by a cool ambience thanks to the lights in my room , so i m pretty content rn .","294221":"i m kinda excited to just lay out in my backyard in the sunshine and read a book .","294222":"cont . . . pick up one thing from the pile and put it back where it belongs . if you find you don t get up too often , if you want to do more , etc . then you can gradually increase to , , etc . items at a time . i cleaned my entire floor and organized my art supplies in around . hours doing this that s actually an awesome idea ! ! that would certainly help me , especially since that s sorta how i clean anyway . the pile itself would bother me more than anything , so i would do what i can to lessen the pile without overwhelming myself . thank you for sharing this","294223":"people who are easy going open minded . who aren t afraid to express their opinions and back up what they re saying with factual evidence . i also enjoy when people play the devil s advocate in order to challenge a perspective usually my perspective , lol even though they don t necessarily agree with the opinion they re proposing .","294224":"i prefer cold weather . i can t stand the heat .","294225":"a blue dress sandals .","294226":"poetalunam but i only accept people i know .","294227":"hello do you have a question ? ?","294228":"sorta in the middle , but more leaning towards soft .","294229":"a feeling of safety in their own home . it s integral for children to feel safe and secure in their house , for their own mental and physical health and development while growing up . children are like sponges and take in everything around them , and if they experience violent or unsafe things in their home then it could really affect them later on in life .","294230":"i believe it s worse to get bad news early in the morning . then you re forced to live the rest of the day with it plaguing your mind , and it could interfere with your daily tasks or your work . at least at night , you can sleep on it and maybe come to terms with it by the time morning arrives .","294231":"no , that s not stupid at all . you can break up with someone because you realize the relationship was no good then still miss what you either had in the past or could have had afterwards . it s actually pretty common .","294232":"good morning ! ! things are going well . today is friday , which means a short day at work then i have the weekend all to myself . this week at work dragged and i m so relieved that i can have a break for two days , lmao .","294233":"i m so terribly sorry that you and the other girls endured such a thing . i m glad that you guys got out of the friendship though .","294234":"aw , do it ! ! it s easier if you do it piece by piece . spend one afternoon on one section of the room and then move onto the next section the following day , etc etc . that way it isn t overwhelming .","294235":"they re yummy , but i don t ever really eat them .","294236":"lol , i didn t even think of it that way . i suppose they tried phrasing it in a way to make me believe it was supposed to be insulting , but obviously their attempts at offending me failed .","294237":"aw , haha . thank you very much . i m planning on doing some more cleaning perhaps not tonight since i just want to sit down and relax , but probably tomorrow night or over the weekend . i have a shoe rack i need to assemble and there s also one corner of my room that s not clean enough for me .","294238":"based on my own personal preferences when it comes to my boyfriend beard . he s had every combination of facial hair imaginable , haha . he s had a full length beard with a mustache , muttonchops with no beard and no mustache , just a mustache with no beard , clean shaven face , etc etc . i find that i like it better when he has a beard , regardless of whether or not he has a mustache , as opposed to when he has just a mustache without the beard . i hope this makes sense . . . lmao .","294239":"my neighbor s house , leading down into his backyard and driveway . the tops of trees from properties of the surrounding neighbors . the main street with other people s cars parked in front of their respective houses . power lines . my room faces the west , so it s nice sometimes when the sun is setting because the amber glow cascades through my window and reflects off of my walls . it brightens everything up and it s rather beautiful .","294240":"technically , leigh is my nickname . but most people refer to me as leigh instead of my given name anyhow .","294241":"my favorite meal is bacon , egg , and cheese on a toasted roll with a large iced coffee . however , considering how unhealthy that is , i normally just eat a granola bar or a yogurt parfait .","294242":"in the next few days , i intend to go to work tomorrow thankfully it s a short day ! , assemble the shoe rack i just purchased , clean up more of my bedroom , do two loads of laundry , and watch season of stranger things .","294243":"disaronno , spiked seltzer , and margaritas .","294244":"i ve been fine not so great , but not so terrible either . the past two weeks have been rather rough for me emotionally , so i ve at least been trying to channel that negative energy into positive coping mechanisms , i . e . cleaning extensively . i wish i took a before picture of my bedroom prior to deep cleaning it , because it s remarkable how much of a difference i made within the span of two weekends . that , at the very least , makes me feel good .","294245":"my family didn t find out until a few years later because i wasn t living with them when i did end up picking up habit back up again . when they did find out , though , they were albeit disappointed but accepting my mother smoked for years , so she really didn t have the authority to say much .","294246":"lmao , if i had a dollar for every time someone has told me this , i would be quite wealthy ! ! thank you , though","294247":"i don t believe i ve ever really been anywhere that i would consider a must see place . although i do admit , seeing the new york city skyline and the skyscraper lights at night is pretty cool .","294248":"considering i m not an object , no . i don t belong to anyone , except possibly my own self .","294249":"experiment , if you re able to do so , and see where your feelings lead you . being confused about your sexuality is rather normal though , so don t fear that you re different or something is wrong simply because you re questioning yourself . it s a normal part of life that most people go through , tbh . the best thing to do , in any scenario , is to look at yourself with an open mind and see where your feelings take you .","294250":"occasionally , yeah . however , i normally go to the same like two places to purchase cigarettes so i haven t been carded in quite some time .","294251":"if there s no way for you to reach out to that person , then i always find it best to discuss your feelings of longing and or grief with someone else who understands how you feel or what you re going through . it can provide incredible validation to hear from someone else that they genuinely empathize with your feelings and you re not alone .","294252":"that s a personal preference , my dude . you like the way my eyes look , but you dislike how other people s eyes look for whatever reason that may be . there isn t a logical explanation behind it . personally , i think all sorts of heterochromia are beautiful .","294253":"i was introduced to smoking cigarettes when i was in my first year of college , actually . my roommate smoked , and the few friends i made when i lived in massachusetts smoked as well . i picked up the habit from them , not necessarily because of peer pressure but because i was going through significant mental distress and i figured it would help me calm down . i actually quit for one year in between my freshman and sophomore year of college , because i had moved back to new york at that point and couldn t smoke because the legal age to smoke where i live is higher than the legal age in massachusetts . however , after i turned i started buying my own packs again .","294254":"i do both , depending on my mood that day . i normally bring lunches to work with me so that i don t have to spend money on a meal , but occasionally i ll buy lunch on wednesdays because it s sushi day at the cafeteria in my office building . as for dinner , most of my meals are home cooked but occasionally my family and i will order takeout .","294255":"i have two best friends , one of which is my boyfriend .","294256":"yes , ab sive friendships are absolutely real , and they re not nearly as talked about as much as ab sive relationships are . regardless of whether the relationship is romantic or platonic , there always needs to be boundaries set and mutual respect between each person . it s perfectly valid and okay to cease friendships with people whom you believe are being manipulative , ab sive , etc etc .","294257":"aw , i followed you ! ! ? everyone go follow livi s new page","294258":"oof , i hope that doesn t happen to me anytime soon . not that it really matters , it was only and i think there s a warranty on it too .","294259":"i didn t even know they existed until last week ! ! lol . i bought one off of amazon to keep my seltzers and beer cold .","294260":"teacher , lol . as i got older , i realized that profession was definitely not for me .","294261":"is a portable fridge considered strange ? ? lmao . i just bought one for my bedroom .","294262":"like , five minutes ago . lmao . i went into the kitchen to get some ice , and my mother turned around to face me and gasped so loudly because she didn t expect me to be there . apparently , i walk very quietly and no one ever sees me coming . lmao .","294263":"a few people come to mind , tbh . the one i m most comfortable talking about is one of my coworkers though , lol . she always talks about herself and when a conversation isn t revolved around her or her experiences , she flat out walks away from us .","294264":"i have no interest in making new friends , so no .","294265":"some people have told me that i have a typical new york accent , lol . that was only when i was out of state , however . when i lived in massachusetts , my roommate and other college friends would always claim i had an accent .","294266":"surprisingly , no . my phone is almost years old , but it still holds a charge relatively well . i do still have to charge my phone once or twice per day , but if i m not using it then the battery doesn t dwindle much at all .","294267":"well , good is really subjective so one person may believe they re a good writer while someone else may not , regardless of their knowledge of grammar . obviously you can t judge someone s skills in writing based solely on their social media presence , you would have to look at their academic papers and whatnot to get a true idea of their grasp on punctuation . regardless , there are plenty of ways a person can improve themselves . normally reading how to books with respect to writing correctly can be very helpful , as well as practicing writing and having someone nearby who can be an editor .","294268":"no , not at all . there s nothing annoying or wrong about people learning a second or third or fourth language . if anything , it s admirable that they know a language other than their native tongue .","294269":"nah , not really . it s just a mashup of the latin root words for poetry and moon .","294270":"it usually only takes me minutes to get ready in the morning . i just wake up , take my medication , get dressed , use the bathroom , brush my hair and teeth , pack my lunch , and leave the house .","294271":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","294272":"i had a really sad dream last night , tbh . i had a dream that my boyfriend s mother was still alive . she was in the hospital being wheeled onto the floor in a wheelchair , and me and my boyfriend and his father ran over to her and gave her a huge hug . i was worried she wouldn t remember me , and she went it s been nine years , you look so beautiful ! i woke up and was heartbroken .","294273":"i ve never purposely hit anyone before .","294274":"depending on my mood , i usually just browse the internet , watch television , hang out with friends , play video games , read , write , paint , or clean .","294275":"a classic baconeggandcheese , a staple of new york living .","294276":"my boyfriend . hopefully i ll be able to kiss him again when i see him tomorrow night .","294277":"i didn t watch the video , but i m assuming it was about a bunch of parents fighting in the middle of the park , right ? ? if that s the case , then i think it s highly immature and inappropriate . not only are your own children watching you behave this way , which is further setting an example for them , but you re being watched by every other child and family in the park . disneyland is supposed to be a family fun , children oriented theme park , so i think any sort of fighting is completely unnecessary and embarrassing .","294278":"it would be easier for me to justify my mood swings if there was a genuine reason behind them , lol . but unfortunately , no nothing has really happened besides my brain going haywire . it happens every now and again . my mood swings are generally stable and mild , but every once in a while , they flare up for no apparent reason .","294279":"right now , i m feeling a bit anxious and flighty . i m trying to calm myself down by listening to music , but it isn t really working very well . i might take hydroxyzine and see if that does anything to help .","294280":"i ve honestly been better . my mood swings have totally been erratic these past two days , ranging from last night s euphoria to this afternoon s anxiety ridden and distracted sadness . i m feeling a bit more stable at this current moment , but overall i ve been somewhat of a mess .","294281":"aw , that s amazing ! ! even just the instrumentals move me to tears sometimes .","294282":"i m not comfortable doing that because i was dm ing a friend of mine on insta .","294283":"well , my healthier coping mechanisms are lighting a candle and or burning incense while laying down , listening to calming music , distracting myself with a television show or movie , and venting to a friend . my unhealthy coping mechanisms are chain smoking and getting drunk .","294284":"i guess the minute phone conversation i had with my boyfriend yesterday , haha . we were just talking about what s going on in our lives , how our day was , his work schedule for the week , his upcoming camping trip , etc etc .","294285":"answering questions , drinking coffee , and listening to music .","294286":"i don t believe there are any topics that i dislike talking about , unless it s something that i m not educated on because then there isn t anything i can really contribute to the conversation .","294287":"i don t have any wild activities that i want to try , lol . my crazy days are far , far behind me . i m looking for contentment and relaxation these days .","294288":"girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . i am not a serial killer by dan wells . the gargoyle by andrew davidson . the secret history by donna tartt . the shining by stephen king .","294289":"surprisingly , i don t think i ve ever been on a ferry before . which is unusual considering the best way to travel to connecticut or fire island from long island is via ferry , lol .","294290":"disrespect retail food service workers . if i witness someone being rude to someone who works in a store or at a restaurant i . e . , cashiers or hostesses and waiters , then my respect for them is totally lost .","294291":"i love my passion for the things i love , i . e . writing , photography , art , video games , music , and my close friendships relationships .","294292":"yeah , i definitely believe so . if someone is too cheerful , then there s the potential that their optimism overshadows realistic outlooks on life , and they re basically living in an illusion as opposed to facing reality .","294293":"mental health and mental illnesses . there s still a lot of stigma surrounding mental health , particularly regarding mental illnesses like bipolar disorder , bpd , psychotic disorders , dissociative disorders , etc etc . there are still so many people out there who think we can just snap out of it or that we re seeking attention for the hell of it . in reality , mental illnesses are serious disorders of the brain which often have physical components as well . they should be taken as seriously as physical illnesses instead of brushed away .","294294":"i don t really have any secrets because my boyfriend my therapist know basically everything about me .","294295":"shallow by lady gaga bradley cooper https www . youtube . com watch ? v bo efyhyu a","294296":"no , i don t judge people on their swearing or slang usage or anything of the sort . personally speaking , i swear a lot and use slang occasionally , so it would be hypocritical for me to judge someone else on those same things , lol .","294297":"i can t tag everyone , but i ll tag a few accounts for you ! ! celinem littlesha shehitsback sweetnothings

play the piano it s my favorite instrument . i have a full length keyboard , but admittedly i never really put enough time into learning how to play it .","294299":"it s basically a light that s in the shape of a three dimensional moon , with very realistic features . i attached an image below , i have the same one shown here","294300":"yes , i absolutely love poetry which is why i ve written a lot of poetry too . i own quite a few books by rupi kaur and lang leav , and my favorite poet is pablo neruda .","294301":"yes , i am very much in love with my boyfriend .","294302":"yes , i ve written dozens upon dozens of poems ! ! i ve been writing poetry since i was a teenager , so more than a decade at this point . most of my poetry is about mental health , but i also experiment with other themes like life and death , addiction , friendship , love , violence , etc etc .","294303":"i feel pretty good rn , actually ! ! i had a very productive day at work , and i had enough energy to run errands after work even though the entire drive there , i was debating on just going home , lol . i treated myself to an iced coffee too . i feel so much better now that i re did my entire bedroom , cleaned all the nooks and crannies , and organized every crevasse . i feel like i have room to breathe , which makes sense because i believe there are studies that prove clean , neat environments are helpful for better mental health .","294304":"yes , i actually have seven tattoos ! ! i m planning on getting my eighth tattoo relatively soon , perhaps around september or october when the weather is cooler .","294305":"unfortunately , none other than my home country the united states .","294306":"no , i ve never heard that song before . the only song of his i know is hallelujah .","294307":"no , i ve never had a desire to go crabbing before .","294308":"to find an affordable apartment . to adopt a cute puppy or even a senior dog . to have more opportunities to travel .","294309":"yes , my boyfriend truly inspires me with his hard work ethic , compassion toward animals , and ambitious nature to get what he wants . he motivates me to do better in my life he s made me realize that i have potential , and if i want something in my life , i have to work hard to get it .","294310":"i see a friend or two perhaps once per week . i socialize enough at work with my coworkers , so by the end of the day i m so mentally drained and want to be left alone .","294311":"i rarely remember my childhood , but i do recall wanting to be some sort of teacher when i was younger . obviously that has changed drastically , lol . i realized when i was a pre teen that being a teacher required social interaction all day , every day , and that isn t something i can handle . i then decided that i wanted to write for a living , so that was something i strived toward .","294312":"having the same interests as your partner is integral in a relationship , in my opinion . how can you really relate to someone , do things together and have discussions if you have no common interests ?","294313":"not particularly , lol . i have depression so most of the time i m either depressed or just content .","294314":"all of my scars are from self h rm or skin picking .","294315":"no , i already have enough . i also have a himalayan rock salt lamp and a moon lamp .","294316":"age doesn t have a particular feeling to me .","294317":"thanks ! ! i am too","294318":"i don t remember my childhood , so i have no memories .","294319":"i don t have a preference . my boyfriend has had bother short hair and very long hair , and it didn t phase me at all . i like a person because of their personality , not so much their hair , lol .","294320":"i wake up around am every morning for work .","294321":"depends on what the decision is . if it s something major or life changing , then i usually think about it for a few days . for most other things , i act spontaneously .","294322":"seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile , having the first cup of coffee in the morning , rainy days , finding a show i genuinely enjoy and binge watching it , seeing friends at a bar or restaurant , nature walks , getting lost in a book , writing creatively , and painting sometimes lol .","294323":"taking a shower , moisturizing , lighting a candle or putting ambient lights on , and relaxing in front of my television with either tea , coffee or a beer .","294324":"not a real gun , no . i ve used airsoft guns and paintball guns , though .","294325":"i m not comfortable discussing it , sorry . it s why i didn t bring it up in my first response .","294326":"ok last photo for the day , i promise lol . i hung lights up all over my room they look so pretty .","294327":"before after ! ! finally done re attaching the shelf to the wall , sorting through and donating half my clothes , and hanging up the remaining clothes . whew . ?","294328":"like i said , in any big city there s that potential . if you stay near times square , though , you should be fine . just remain vigilant of your surroundings and keep your bags purses close to you .","294329":"i m saying there s a potential for your sister to be abducted and sold into sex slavery if both of you aren t careful .","294330":"yeah , the sex trafficking industry is really prominent in big cities in general .","294331":"to be fair , most places are dangerous at night depending on which part you re in . there are good and bad sides to every neighborhood .","294332":"yeah , new york city is tourist central . it s so congested you can barely move there . then those same people move out to long island , making long island even more crowded .","294333":"well , new york city is different from upstate new york and long island . however , it s generally because of how expensive it is to live here . people can t afford to make ends meet .","294334":"i m honestly not sure , lmao . it s becoming increasingly harder to live here and everyone i know is either moving or has already moved out of state . no one wants to stay here anymore .","294335":"i only know a few words of spanish . i solely speak english .","294336":"i guess my boyfriend ? ? he s my partner but also my best friend .","294337":"his birthday is in a few weeks . here s a photo of it from the amazon app","294338":"a cookie jar with a ufo cork top , making it seem like the ufo is beaming up whatever is inside the jar ! !","294339":"this is true ! ! i mean , i ve also had a lot of experience with death in itself , more real than things shown in movies or television . i didn t really want to say that in my original answer , though lol .","294340":"no , probably not . i ve seen too many crime shows and follow too many blogs to really be phased by death .","294341":"by simply existing .","294342":"helping my father install the clothes rack on my wall in my bedroom , lmao . it ripped itself out of the wall yesterday with all of my clothing still on it , so now we finally have it back secured in the wall .","294343":"i d like to visit europe one day , but i don t know about living there at the moment .","294344":"no , i would never in a million years move to new york city . it s gross to live in , expensive af , and it s always congested with people .","294345":"that s not true , lol . we have disagreements but they never explode into an actual argument anymore although it did in the past . our relationship is very far from perfect .","294346":"no , i don t judge people s pasts . my boyfriend has a checkered past himself , and i understand that he s a different person now and what s in the past is staying in the past . people make mistakes and learn from them , and as long as they recognize their behavior was hurtful and make amends to be a better person , then that past doesn t matter to me .","294347":"i wouldn t lie about that so yes , really . it doesn t matter if you come off anon , at least now i can see who s sending me disgusting messages .","294348":"no , no one is perfect and no relationship is perfect either . even if a relationship seems perfect on the outside , guaranteed those people have flaws and concerns about their relationship that is kept hidden from everyone else .","294349":"i don t feel the need to satisfy a gross anon s desire to see me in a bathing suit .","294350":"i don t even own a bikini , lmaoo . if i did , i wouldn t post a photo on askfm .","294351":"lol . that s my boyfriend and he just got finished with a hour shift beginning at am .","294352":"i m years old .","294353":"celebrities , hollywood , new york city , american cuisine , etc etc . the list goes on on .","294354":"confession i haven t showered in like three days i m aching to shower after i m done cleaning today .","294355":"other people s perceptions of me some people find me attractive , others find me ugly . as for intelligence , i ve read a lot of books and studied thoroughly throughout my life . i m always looking to educate myself through various mediums .","294356":"none of my talents are hidden or secretive , lol . my only talents are really in the arts , i . e . writing , painting , and photography .","294357":"well , let s get started then .","294358":"hello do you have a question ? ?","294359":"i have one black tee shirt that says with enough coffee , i can rule the world .","294360":"is there ? idk .","294361":"lol same . it s funny how our minds work like that .","294362":"lol , she was going to write out loud but wrote something else instead of the word out , i don t remember what it was i don t feel like scrolling . it s interesting because my mind automatically filled it in with the correct word , so i didn t even notice there was a typo , lol . cc livibates","294363":"chester bennington rest in peace will always be my hero , long after his death . he and his music were there for me during crucial struggles of my life , and i turned to music and the fan community when i was enduring trauma . if it wasn t for him , his passion for music , and his personality in general that he showed to his fans , i probably wouldn t be here today .","294364":"browsing social media , haha . i spend my spare time using askfm when i don t have other responsibilities at hand .","294365":"meeting my boyfriend , and eventually when i realized how life changing of an experience our relationship would be once we started dating often . he s always been a non judgmental beacon of support for me , and he always brings out my best potential and believes in me even when i don t believe in myself .","294366":"spanish would probably be the most practical language for me to learn .","294367":"hello thank you . i m doing well . i just got some packages from amazon , so i m going to spend the afternoon fixing up my bedroom , since i ordered some string lights and light bulbs for my himalayan rock salt lamp .","294368":"well i m non binary , so jot that down . i m not a winner or a loser . i m a realist who doesn t think in terms of winning or losing because everyone has their flaws and attributes .","294369":"? ? ?","294370":"aw , thank you ! ! honestly , my eyes are like one of the few things i genuinely like about myself . besides the fact that i m almost legally blind .","294371":"natural bathroom lighting is the best , haha . ignore my unruly brows .","294372":"aw , thank you","294373":"like i said , i know nothing about children . lol . all i know is that i was years old when i started high school , i think . i graduated high school at the age of .","294374":"it s the capital of poland , i believe .","294375":"i don t know much about elementary aged children to begin with , so my opinion may be a bit uninformed . however , i believe lgbt relationships and gender identity should be introduced into curriculum during the middle school years , like around the ages of or so . they re old enough at that point to understand what they re being taught and also to understand their own emotions and feelings toward the subject .","294376":"it s quite common for ab se survivors , actually . you were hurt by their actions , and perhaps even traumatized by them , and so as a result , you want to shut them out of your emotions , life , events , etc etc . , because that shows vulnerability and you don t want your well being to be compromised again . i m the exact same way . i don t key my family in to any aspect of my life at all , i m shut off from my family emotionally , and i don t tell them anything about what s going on in my life besides big events i . e . , me getting my new job two years ago . i m also very uncomfortable around and embarrassed by my parents , particularly my mother , so i totally empathize with your situation .","294377":"the original rainbow flag should do the job just fine , lol . there are also flags for being gay , bi , lesbian , trans , non binary , asexual , etc etc . i just personally believe the original rainbow flag encompasses everything .","294378":"is this the one ? seems like , according to google , the black and brown lines represent marginalized communities , and the rest of the new colors represent the trans community . i think it s good that it s more inclusive , but i also believe it s a bit unnecessary since they have their own flags as well .","294379":"i didn t know about this . what did they update about it ? i think it s fine the way it currently is , with the normal rainbow scheme . there are plenty of other flags for other orientations and identities . i believe the rainbow flag jut encompasses everything and is the umbrella flag for the entire lgbt community .","294380":"i think it depends on the child , really . i m not exactly well versed in children or child education , but i believe that perhaps they should be taught at around an older age , like or years old . or if the child expresses a gender identity that differs from their sex from an early age , they can be taught about gender at that age as well .","294381":"my day has been going well . i woke up around am , made myself a cup of coffee , and ran a few errands before anyone else in the house woke up . after i came home , i made myself an iced coffee since then , i ve basically been listening to music and browsing the internet . later , i m planning on re attaching my clothes rack to my wall and hanging all of my clothing up again , since yesterday everything unhinged itself and fell off the wall .","294382":"i like doing video responses , but sadly my phone does not , lol . every time i try to post one , it says it can t post it , for whatever reason . i ve tried uninstalling reinstalling the app , taking videos from different orientations , using the front facing or regular camera , etc etc . i wonder if it s because my phone is a bit older , so it doesn t support it ? i m not entirely sure .","294383":"those are different from the bones you sit on .","294384":"lol . i was so confused . i ve literally never heard of anyone referring to their ass as cheekbones .","294385":"i ve literally never heard anyone call those cheekbones , lmao . they re actually called sit bones .","294386":"yes , your cheekbones are on your face .","294387":"i love my eyes and my hair the most . i also like my cheekbones .","294388":"yeah , one of my friends from middle school , who introduced my boyfriend to me when we were in high school , ended our friendship after my boyfriend ended his friendship with her boyfriend i hope this makes sense , lol . my boyfriend and her boyfriend were best friends , and when their friendship ended , she decided to cut me off entirely with no reason or explanation .","294389":"i believe so , yes . if my boyfriend wanted to move to cuba , for example , i would be more than willing to learn spanish and cuban traditions . i already know a little bit of spanish through interacting with his family and have experienced a bit of the cuisine through my boyfriend s grandmother , and it would certainly be a learning experience to witness those traditions first hand .","294390":"true friendship , in my personal opinion , is having a friendship where both people care about each other equally and reach out during times of need . there s no vying for the other person s attention or affection , and you both can be percent yourselves around each other . you can talk to your friend about almost anything going on in your life without fear of ridicule or judgment , and vice versa .","294391":"i would rather go into the past , just so i could educate myself on certain events like the victorian era or world war ii .","294392":"i just looked up the term deep state , and i don t really understand it very much but it generally seems like it refers to the collusion of government officials with influential people in various industries to put forth policies and ideas whose true intentions are hidden from the general public ? if that s the case , then yes .","294393":"i firmly believe that the government knows about the existence of extraterrestrial lifeforms and is actively hiding it from the general public .","294394":"answering questions , listening to music , and drinking an iced coffee .","294395":"i wholeheartedly agree . years ago , although i struggled with depression , i basically didn t want to help myself because i thought i was so deep in the hole that there wasn t any worth for me to seek out help . it ended up making my mental illness worse , and i really didn t realize that until it was almost too late .","294396":"some people can break out of those negative thought patterns , yes . it takes a lot of self talk , soul searching , and acknowledgment that your thoughts are toxic in order to really get over your own prejudice . it s entirely possible to break free from problematic perspectives against communities whether it s the lgbt , black , asian , or spanish communities , etc etc . . i think it s easier when people are younger , because when you re older it becomes so conditioned within you that it s difficult to really escape from those prejudices .","294397":"if i like someone , it s regardless of their skin color . my boyfriend has light skin despite the fact that he s spanish .","294398":"she s going to have to want to exercise in order for her to begin exercising you can t force someone to do something they don t want to do . and generally , people with mental illness react negatively to the stereotypical response of exercise will help ! sometimes exercising takes away the depression temporarily , but it isn t a cure all . if anything , it s something that distracts people with mental illness from their feelings . it doesn t actually help or cure the depression . however , everyone is different .","294399":"most people comment on how colorful and great my hair is , haha . i can pull off nearly any color or combination of colors , and a lot of people indicate that they re too afraid to color their hair a funky color .","294400":"smoking cigarettes or marijuana around children . i believe it s irresponsible for people to do both , especially regarding smoking cigarettes because of the severe health risks associated with second hand smoking .","294401":"no , i believe that s a common misconception that arises out of a patriarchal society where women have always been seen as in hysteria and men were revered for being the logical , rational type to make the greater decisions . in reality , women and men are equally as irrational , and men are actually just as emotional this also stems from toxic masculinity , because men have been conditioned to suppress their emotions because it s seen as weak for men to show emotion .","294402":"i wouldn t have started self h rming when i was a pre teen and i would have tried to be more open to therapy , because at that time i was dealing with a lot of complex mental health issues .","294403":"i would assume probably within the next years . i don t really have much hope for the stability of the earth , tbh .","294404":"this is one of watsky s most under rated songs . god , it s so good and deep talking to myself https www . youtube . com watch ? v fsw z qthsa","294405":"climate change and the effects of global warming , most definitely . the previous generations really destroyed the environment and the ozone layers , among other environmental things , and we re currently reaping the costs of those behaviors through severe , unpredictable weather patterns and increasingly hot summers and freezing winters . it s going to be significant for the next generation and it s going to rise to one of the highest concerns .","294406":"there are actually a lot of physical cues to tell if someone is lying . a few of them are pausing before answering an obvious question . verbal non verbal contradictions , i . e . someone nodding while saying no or looking off to the side while speaking . hiding their mouth or eyes while speaking . gulping or swallowing before answering a question or speaking . hand to face activity , i . e . picking at the lips , scratching the head , pulling on the ears , etc etc . it means their anxiety has been triggered . adjusting their shirt , fixing their glasses , playing with their hair , or wiping sweat off their brow .","294407":"honestly , most of the time i dream about work , lmao . which is absolutely terrible but i guess it means that it s taking over my life . i actually had a dream the other night that my coworker and i went to a party together , and she asked me to grab a gun from her car and keep it in the back of my pants in case anything bad happened . i was hiding it from people , obviously . when i woke up , i told my coworker about the dream she looked up what it means , and apparently hiding a gun in a dream means that i m suppressing feelings of anger . which . . . isn t really untrue , haha .","294408":"in general , i try not to regret things in my life . i believe that it s useless and harmful to focus on past events and wonder what you could have done differently , because there isn t anything you can do to change them now . you can only accept them for what they are and move on . however , one thing i do sorta regret is beginning self h arm . i was years old and finally stopped when i was around years old . it took over my entire teenage years .","294409":"all of my favorite vacations involved the trees , mountains , fields , rivers , etc etc . my boyfriend and i used to travel to upstate new york often i absolutely loved the atmosphere , the nature , the fresh air , and the starry night sky which you can t see where i live . i like vacations where you don t have a specific repertoire , you can do whatever you want whenever you want to . i find that having a lot of vacation plans is really overwhelming and you don t really get to enjoy the freedom and spontaneity of being on vacation .","294410":"arrogance believing that they re better or higher up than other people because they have money , or are attractive , or own a nice car , or have a nice job , etc etc . no one is inherently better than anyone else and it s sickening and unappealing when a person believes they re entitled to more things than others .","294411":"i can t choose between the two ! ! i find intelligence very attractive , but i also need a partner who s really funny because i need humor in my life for me to get through the rough times .","294412":"i don t really think it s a good thing to judge people in general without knowing them personally first . in the case of askfm , i think reading people s answers may give off the impression that we know someone , but really people only post what they want to post and it often isn t a full representation of who they really are .","294413":"i think i would rather use a pseudonym for my writing should i ever become a published author in the future . although i m proud of my writing , i wouldn t necessarily like all of the attention if my writing became popular , especially when that translate to real life scenarios .","294414":"aw , thank you ! ! when i was much younger like my early teen years , i would sort of adopt rowling s writing style but create my own stories , which at that time was mainly fan fiction . i also read a lot of stephen king s books and anne rice s books enjoyed their descriptive style , so i also tried adopting those styles and emulated them in my own writing , during a time when i was trying to find my own unique voice . eventually i branched out from adopting other people s styles , and as i got older , my writing matured . i still don t have an established voice per say because my style does change slightly depending on what i m writing , but now i definitely know how to write things according to my own perspectives while maintaining my own voice .","294415":"i need to read books because alongside the voice in my mind reading the words to me , i need the physical act of seeing the words on the page in front of me in order to really grasp the material . audiobooks don t translate well to me , it s difficult for me to follow . i also don t like reading books on kindles and other screens , it hurts my eyes after a while .","294416":"i ve never had any weird arguments . most of my arguments although they re rare are about serious matters .","294417":"i just listened to the song , from a lyrics video like you suggested , and i m surprised i never heard this song before ! ! it s a true testament to the problem with gun violence , especially when it comes to gangs and whatnot . thank you for showing me ! ! it s interesting i m a big fan of mike shinoda s rapping style and i can definitely see where he gets his influence and rhythm from , especially in the hybrid theory days . here s one of my favorites https www . youtube . com watch ? v nandz ah yi","294418":"i believe the most recent movie i watched on netflix was the crow .","294419":"honestly , most of the clothing i purchase is from amazon , lmao . however , i also like torrid and black craft cult s clothing .","294420":"ambitious , impulsive , and sensible .","294421":"both , in different ways . i m motivated to reach my goals , but i also have a bad habit of being attached to certain people in my life to the point where it hurts me .","294422":"one of my coworkers who just changed her phone number to get away from an ab sive ex .","294423":"honestly , i would probably just wear the same dress that s in my profile picture . it s a red , floral knee length empire waist dress .","294424":"a one week vacation . i ve never taken a vacation that long before it s something i feel i desperately need . i ve been getting so burnt out from work lately but at the same time , i feel like if i do take a vacation , then the stuff i m directing at work would fall super behind .","294425":"cont . . . just some how stop being poor . you know what s not fair ? having to struggle to pay your bills even in a two income household i wasn t implying that those who can t afford to pay their bills in general aren t trying hard enough . i was inferring that i wouldn t be interested in dating someone who couldn t pay their bills , and they weren t interested in doing any better than that . i wasn t making a general statement about poor people , it was localized to one specific situation . however , i do understand what you mean and agree wholeheartedly . i also come from a background where i didn t make enough money to pay my bills either when i was much younger , and it had no reflection on my work ethic . i was just in a sh tty job with a sh tty situation at the time .","294426":"aw , thank you ! !","294427":"you can if you want to , but i won t click it . just send me the name of the artist and the title of the song .","294428":"i don t even know who that is .","294429":"yeah , i listen to rap regularly .","294430":"yeah , but a bike could also mean like a motorbike .","294431":"a song i was listening to made me very emotional , lol .","294432":"yeah , there were several fights in my high school between people to the point where sometimes the police had to get involved . i never intervened , that was basically asking for a death wish .","294433":"a necklace with a cross on it , haha . i m not religious in the least , but for some reason , someone thought that i needed a cross necklace don t remember if it was for my birthday or xmas . i expressed thanks and gratitude , of course , but i never wore it .","294434":"a few days ago , while driving home from work .","294435":"no , i don t believe in reincarnation so the concept has never troubled me .","294436":"yeah , i rarely eat beef as it is .","294437":"random fact i never learned how to ride a bicycle as a child .","294438":"australia , new zealand , aruba , england , italy , and spain .","294439":"i wasn t talking about poverty . but there comes a point where people need to do what s necessary to pay their bills . it s great to enjoy your career , but if you re making such little money that you can t even pay your bills and you don t even care , then that s a personality trait more than anything else . there s no motivation to do better . i m also coming from the perspective where people need two incomes , at the very least , to keep afloat where i live , lol .","294440":"sometimes it s a , other times it s a . there s really no in between .","294441":"i probably wouldn t be interested in dating them , then . at this stage of my life , i m looking for someone who is independent and doesn t have to rely on anyone . if a prospective partner couldn t pay their bills , then that would mean that i would have to pay their bills for them in order to keep them afloat . that isn t fair .","294442":"i believe this is a universal love , haha .","294443":"no , i ve never had surgery before .","294444":"i don t remember my childhood , so i really don t know .","294445":"my entire clothes rack , with the clothes still on it , unhinged itself from the wall and came crashing down almost on top of me , lmao . i just spent the last two hours cleaning it up , and now all of my clothes are on my bed and i have no idea what to do with them . it made me laugh because only this would happen to me on what was supposed to be a relaxing day . oh , and i also sliced my foot open while moving furniture .","294446":"youtube for music , netflix for television shows and documentaries .","294447":"no , i ve only ever worn a wig once for halloween .","294448":"the career path itself doesn t matter to me , as long as they re doing what makes them happy and they can afford to pay their bills .","294449":"exercise more often and or go for walks outside , read books , take some photographs at the park or beach , spend time with friends , paint and or color , and sleep .","294450":"when i have a bad day , i normally spend time alone so that i can collect myself , reflect , and relax . i ll put on a good documentary about true crime or put on relaxing music , make a hot cup of coffee , and light a candle or incense . on the contrary , sometimes cleaning helps me organize my thoughts and puts me in a better mood because i like clean , organized spaces . it gives me a sense of accomplishment and also distracts me from how i m feeling .","294451":"infj ! !","294452":"you cannot heal in the same environment that made you sick .","294453":"haha , no . i ve never seen a ufo or alien before . i wholeheartedly believe that they exist , though .","294454":"i had a meeting with my supervisor and another editor who works for print production in regards to the content my department creates . i m currently an interim director for the magazine project , because the previous director went on maternity leave for three months . so , in the meeting my supervisor basically asked me if i was open to starting up and directing my own project when the director takes back her role when she returns from leave . my supervisor told me that i was excelling as interim director and has full faith that i can direct my own project now . so i jumped on the opportunity and said yes .","294455":"no , it really doesn t . regardless of rowling s stance on trans people or feminism and whatnot , the books still had a substantial impact on me growing up . it doesn t take away from the fact that those books influenced me in becoming a writer .","294456":"what i do in the summer doesn t really differ much from what i do the rest of the year , besides spending more time outside . i like going down to the bay and listen to live music , but that s really the only summer related activity i do .","294457":"it depends on who you ask , lol . some people believe i m relatively normal while others know me on a deeper , more personal level and can see my weirdness more . my boyfriend will be the first person to tell you that i m weird af .","294458":"lol , is she really ? i had no idea about that .","294459":"i think of success in the context of happiness or satisfaction with one s own goals and milestones . successful people , in my opinion , are those who are actively trying to accomplish their goals and work hard to do so . they re trying to attain a level of contentment and satisfaction in their lives to better themselves and other people . unsuccessful people , on the other hand , are people with no real drive or motivation to better themselves . they re just sorta existing or they take advantage of those around them .","294460":"the harry potter books by j . k . rowling completely changed my life . it was one of my first real introductions to creative fiction and the first book series i became obsessed with . it inspired my own journey into reading and writing , and soon i began trying to emulate rowling s style into my own fictional pieces until i developed my own voice .","294461":"i believe it s fine for people to have their own preferences , yeah . it s normal for people to not want to date others who don t take proper care of their hygiene , who are perhaps too tall or too short for them , who don t have the same interests , etc etc . i think it becomes shallow when someone doesn t want to date someone who s a different race especially in a racist context , or something along those lines .","294462":"i just ordered some clothing off of torrid i m super excited to receive them .","294463":"i would rather shop online . i find shopping in the store is a bit of a hassle , and you can easily find better deals online as opposed to in the store , especially if free shipping is involved .","294464":"no , i don t have any particular plans , unfortunately . i went out spontaneously with my friend last night which was honestly a somewhat bad idea , my anxiety was sky high because there were so many other people out . i might see my boyfriend tonight depending on how he s feeling . otherwise , i m just planning on cleaning and doing laundry .","294465":"i really have no idea , haha . if there was no more electricity , then i would be out of a job because i work on a computer all day . i suppose i could become an off the grid sort of person , travel to the middle of nowhere and start my own commune , but that isn t like me at all .","294466":"i d rather spend the day at the beach and work on my tan , go in the water maybe , and listen to music with whoever i m with .","294467":"cont . . . oh and also sometimes i think i might have to let them go . probably not but the thought has definitely crossed my mind . but i have no one except for them and i am scared i might make the wrong choice , i don t know . not replying to my texts during a breakdown kind of says something , to be honest . when she had a breakdown and all sorts after work i met her and bought her ice cream and all even when i had work the next day . i m not boasting , definitely isn t my intention , but when it comes to me , i don t get anything and i thought i have cut of all people who i didn t want in my life already . ugh , i feel this hardcore . i also empathize with the notion that you don t want to be alone because they re all that you have . i don t have many friends at all , and if i were to cut them out of my life , then i would have no one except my boyfriend which isn t necessarily a bad thing , but i need friends too . it s wrong of her to not respond at all when you re having a breakdown or even just a bad day . even though she says she doesn t know how to respond , i agree with you that at least acknowledgment of the messages means something .","294468":"i always tend to sleep more deeply after i ve already woken up in the morning and decide to go back to bed for another hour or two . these days , i ve been waking up around am , so on the weekends i always go back to sleep until around am , and those few hours are the most deep sleeps i ever experience .","294469":"i listen to the radio every morning on the weekdays while i m driving into work . there s a local alternative rock radio station that i enjoy listening to ! ! they play musicians like stone temple pilots , nirvana , pearl jam , audioslave , muse , korn , marilyn manson , etc etc .","294470":"the bartender last night gave me a free drink as a buy back , if that counts for anything . normally if you order three drinks , they give you your fourth drink for free .","294471":"no ? misgendering someone is albeit rude , particularly when it s done on purpose , but it s nowhere near violent unless that person makes actual threats toward someone else s health or well being .","294472":"i m not currently wearing nail polish , but here s a photo of when i got my nails done a few years ago .","294473":"i believe gender exists on a spectrum , not that there are a distinct number of genders i . e . , just man or woman . people who are transgender are usually a trans man or a trans woman , but there are also those who are non binary , genderfluid , agender , etc etc .","294474":"i m actually left handed .","294475":"i would reveal the usernames behind every anonymous question so i can see who s sending sick or hateful messages , haha .","294476":"i m not interested in asking you questions . i m also not interested in coins .","294477":"are the authorities looking into it ? ?","294478":"not anymore . i ve become too self aware and anxiety ridden to feel comfortable taking big risks these days .","294479":"not generally , no . however , there has been this one random phone number calling me every morning around am , but they never leave a message .","294480":"i don t care about to look up something that insignificant .","294481":"yeah , just because you have friends who are of a minority group doesn t make you any less racist . it doesn t excuse your actions or thought patterns .","294482":"oh , hell no . i try singing and i do it often enough in my car , but i m definitely terrible at it .","294483":"not really , just tapestries and string lights .","294484":"consuming large amounts of coffee in little time frames .","294485":"i used to be able to quote harry potter and the sorcerer s stone word for word when i was younger , lol . but i haven t watched the movie in a really long time , so i m not sure if i still can .","294486":"no , i don t care enough about phone apps to pay actual money for them .","294487":"writing has always been a natural talent of mine . i ve been writing stories and poetry for as long as i can remember , and it s always been my go to outlet for both creativity and expressing my feelings .","294488":"no , this is the first time i ve heard of him . i ll look him up though ! !","294489":"i prefer showers . i get really bored in baths , lmao . after like five minutes , i m usually done with it and looking for something else to do . they re not relaxing to me at all .","294490":"my brother at the wedding i went to two weeks ago , haha .","294491":"certain songs of the skyrim soundtrack , heavy rain hitting the window or roof , and thunderstorms .","294492":"a lot of soul searching regarding my relationships with people and how i m realizing that i put too much into certain relationships and don t get anything back in return . it s disheartening , and i care too much about these people , but i really need to start letting go .","294493":"lately , anything by lizzo , childish gambino , or nf .","294494":"aahh , i m honestly in the same situation as you right now . i care about my friends a lot and check up on them often , but they basically never do the same for me except for one of my coworkers . the reason why i haven t done what you re suggesting is because i really don t know how to bring up the topic without sounding like i m accusing them of being a bad friend or something . i ve sent texts that would literally say that i was on the verge of a breakdown or in the middle of a breakdown , and often i would get no response . i don t know if that means i should find better friends , but idk . i don t really have an answer for you , i m afraid . i m in the same exact boat , and it sucks .","294495":"any of the fetish questions are weird and uncalled for , lol .","294496":"cont . . . that is envisioning how my kids will look like w him . this sounds terrible , but i m worried they won t be cute enough . i mean i know they ll have light skin maybe good hair not too coarse , but not light eyes it bothers me they won t appear white enough . i know it s wrong to be so shallow i should look beyond the physical but i can t seem to shake the feelings of disappointment . it s rooted in a lot of insecurity my own personal beauty standards . what do you think i should do , do you have any advice ? thx well , first thing it s good that you recognize that your thoughts are wrong and they re possibly rooted in your own insecurities and beauty standards . that s the first step in acknowledging negative thought patterns and reversing them , or getting over them to create more positive thought patterns . honestly , it doesn t surprise me that you feel this way . there s such stigma and discrimination against black people and latino people , especially when they have biracial children and your hope that your child appears white is just a product of that stigma . you re afraid that they re going to be discriminated against or teased for being a mixture of black , white , and latino . but , you have to eventually realize that when you become a mother , your child ren will be the most beautiful things to you . perhaps you simply need to mature more , but coming from my experiences with my friends who have kids , any insecurity regarding their appearance disappears after they re born because you develop such an intimate connection with your child during pregnancy . at that point , you just want to provide what s best for them . as for what to do . . . there really isn t much for you to physically do in this instance . it s just a matter of you thinking about why you have these thoughts to begin with and try to work on overcoming them .","294497":"no , i haven t done art in quite a long time . the last time i attempted to paint or anything was a few months ago , but i got so frustrated that i totally gave up on the painting , lmao .","294498":"um . . . this is social media , lol . you cannot see my face , nor do you know what i sound like . i just simply stated that you asked me this question once before and that i honestly do not care .","294499":"yeah , i didn t know either until seeing a thread on twitter like minutes ago that posted the message she wrote it looked like instagram . and not only children , but elderly people with no immune systems , people with autoimmune disorders , people recovering from cancer . . . the list goes on and on .","294500":"i don t think i m the angry one in this exchange , lmao .","294501":"you asked me this once already . i told you that i didn t care enough to view your profile .","294502":"not always , no . i have a really terrible memory , to be perfectly honest . i do remember most conversations , but the general meaning of the conversation , not so much the small details .","294503":"hello do you have a question ? ?","294504":"considering she literally could have hurt or k lled people , no . she posted a picture on social media indicating that she had the flu before she licked the ice cream and wanted to start an epidemic . for people with compromised immune systems , that s incredibly deadly .","294505":"holy crap , haha . that s a good thing because it s endangerment to the health of other people . it s a really serious matter .","294506":"customers .","294507":"there s this new trend apparently where people like . . . use grocery items or lick items or something , and then put them back on the shelves . it s disgusting .","294508":"either they have something to give me , or they have a crush on me , haha . either way i m not particularly interested .","294509":"absolutely disgusting i m pretty sure it s also against the law . as someone who comes from a retail environment , it s an incredibly disservice to the store and those who work in that store because of shrink percentages .","294510":"? ? ?","294511":"see a therapist .","294512":"i don t really think it s these days , i believe it s always been that way with people and relationships . a lot of people are either afraid of or not interested in commitment . as for your situation , depending on how close you are and or how long you ve been dating , perhaps you should tell your partner how you feel . just because it s long distance doesn t mean the relationship is less valid .","294513":"i finally remembered to grab my dslr camera from my best friend s mother s house , lol . i want to go out and take more photos now .","294514":"she lives somewhere near keene , i believe ! ! she s always posting photos of cute towns and hiking trails and whatnot .","294515":"yesterday morning . i was hungover when i woke up .","294516":"no , but being an assh le does .","294517":"that s a very high and inaccurate percentage , lmao . you ll find a girlfriend , don t stress out about it .","294518":"i m seeing my best friend since she came back to new york for the weekend .","294519":"yeah , it s pretty much the same here too . lmao , one time when i was working at the drug store , my coworker brought in one of those bags and just smoked from the bag instead of putting the cigarettes in like an empty pack . i was like . . . wut .","294520":"ugh , that s so terrible . if he s dead set in his ways , i really don t know what you could say to him that would convince him otherwise especially if you tried everything already . perhaps your mom stepmom whoever can try to talk to him about it , if she s also bothered by it ?","294521":"i write every day at work , so honestly by the time i get home , i m exhausted and my brain turns to mush , haha . i haven t written anything creatively in quite a while .","294522":"aahh , that s so unhealthy . i m so sorry you have to deal with that ! ! even though i m a smoker , i would never smoke inside the house or inside anyone else s house , it s just disgusting . the chemicals from the smoke stains everything and leaves every object with the terrible scent . if you haven t tried before , maybe explain second hand smoke to him and indicate that you don t want to get health problems just because he smokes ? ideally , he should be more considerate of you since you re his child and your health is at risk .","294523":"holyyyyyy crap ! ! that s more expensive that new york city . yeah , i totally need to go to the reservations because cartons of their own brand of cigarettes are really cheap .","294524":"jesus christ , lmao . that s so ridiculous .","294525":"yeah , probably . he has a hell of a memory , much better than my own memory . honestly , he would be the one to bring it up first because i would have forgotten that i said it in the first place .","294526":"wtf is a sin tax ? ! we get taxed on cigarettes too so most times , two packs of cigarettes costs me like .","294527":"i m honestly not sure . i think it depends on the company , whether or not they would ask . either way , if they discriminate against you or don t give you a job simply because you took a few years off to focus on your health , they re not a good company to work for . also , you re not obligated to get into specifics if they do ask . you can simply say it was for health reasons .","294528":"definitely not , lmao . that s pretty much an omen that the relationship is going to fail .","294529":"aw , you too ! !","294530":"yeah , we have drifted apart . that doesn t mean i don t care about her anymore , though . and she s helped me a lot throughout my life and helped me cope with the trauma i endured when i was a teenager , so even though we don t talk often anymore , she s still important to me .","294531":"considering it takes me minutes to an hour to drive to work every day , going to mastic doesn t seem so terrible , lol . i just haven t had the motivation to go .","294532":"not at all . i don t regret any of my tattoos because they were super meaningful to me at one point in my life , and most of them still hold meaning because they represent me , my life , and my friends relationship .","294533":"yeah , the one everyone i know goes to is the one in mastic . which honestly isn t a terrible drive the other one is in southampton , which is hard to get to .","294534":"i mean . . . we sorta are , lol . the only justification is if we go to the reservations , which i ve been meaning to do lately because a carton is like .","294535":"ugh , smh . i mean if i lived there , i would probably never quit , lmao . i just looked up cigarette prices by state apparently they re less than in kentucky and alabama .","294536":"omg i know . it s the same in queens too ! ! i mean , cigarettes are already expensive on long island compared to other places , but in the city , it s absolutely ridiculous .","294537":"yeah , that s my ultimate goal actually . i was thinking of checking out north carolina or virginia .","294538":"yeah , i ve definitely had that happen to me multiple times before . i would absolutely hate living , or even working , in the city because of how congested everything is . also it s expensive af , i think even more expensive than long island .","294539":"no , at the last second she claimed she was feeling fine and stayed until the regular time we normally leave . we think it was because my other coworker did catch her in the bathroom and saw she was fine . this wouldn t be the first time she s lied to our faces about sh t , though . she s generally a very sneaky and manipulative person and we ve caught her in lies before .","294540":"things i like about new york city all of the things to do and opportunities to see , i . e . restaurants , plays , and museums . everything is open until late at night . hot dog and halal vendors on the street . they literally have the best food . things i dislike about new york city how crowded everything is . you barely have room to walk half the time . the commute via train to the city . it s expensive and annoying . the smell . most people don t know about it , but everything smells like hot garbage .","294541":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","294542":"my coworker lied straight to my face about feeling sick in order for her to leave work early . she claimed she was vomiting in the bathroom at work , but when my other coworker went there to check up on her , she was leaning against the wall just looking at her phone . she didn t wash her hands or her face , which is normally what someone would do had they been vomiting like she said she was . it was a beautiful day outside all morning she was complaining that she didn t want to be at work and all she wanted to do was go in her friend s pool . so me and my other coworkers a few of us are in a group chat together think that she lied just so she could leave early and hang out with her friend .","294543":"it s no problem at all ! ! i hope you have a great day weekend , my friend .","294544":"i would rather go to a small gathering . big parties are definitely not my scene , especially because of my sensory issues and social anxiety .","294545":"sometimes , lol . at times , it s easier to get involved in tasks with multiple steps when you walk them through out loud to yourself .","294546":". . . why am i doing those things ? obviously because i want to .","294547":"yes , i love avocados guacamole . i actually have an avocado tattoo on my ankle , lmao it also symbolizes my friendship with my best friend , since we both love avocados .","294548":"cont . . . want to find love but i kind of think it s impossible for anyone to love me . i understand that too , about the whole best friend thing . honestly , my best friend and i have drifted apart ever since she moved to another state , and i don t tell her anything about my family and struggles because i either don t want to burden her or i feel like a broken record , always complaining about the same exact thing over over again . as for your second statement you seem like a beautiful , compassionate person and i guarantee that you will find love one day . you re young and you have your whole life ahead of you , and there is definitely someone that exists who will accept you for all that you are , struggles and all .","294549":"i m currently answering questions on askfm , listening to music , and drinking an iced coffee .","294550":"i m feeling pretty good today , actually . i got a terrific amount of sleep i didn t drink alcohol last night , so i woke up feeling refreshed . i forgot how good i felt in the morning on nights that i m sober , and i m actively trying to continue on this path . i m currently drinking coffee what else is new ? and waiting for my best friend to text me back . she s back in new york for the weekend we re planning on seeing each other .","294551":"ugh , i feel this completely . i m also looking to move out but it s nearly impossible considering how expensive everything is around my area i live in new york . my therapist , my boyfriend and i all agree that my mental health would be x more stable if i lived independently and didn t have to deal with my family on a daily basis . i could finally be in control of my own life and do things on my own time without having to worry about my family judging me . also , no problem at all ! ! i m glad i was able to help . just remember that i m always here if you need to rant , we re in very similar situations so i sympathize completely . xx","294552":"this is a pretty difficult situation to be in , so if you re currently experiencing this , then i empathize with you . really , you re just going to have to be upfront and honest with you . space out a time where you two can both sit down and have a discussion , and then explain to her what she s been doing , how it s been making you feel , how it s possibly been hurting her or you or the people around her , and provide support for her if she s willing to recognize these patterns and change . be sure to identify that you don t think anything less of her or that you don t want to be her friend anymore . tell her you care about her immensely and that s why you feel the need to have this conversation . you want what s best for her .","294553":"it depends on who s trying to tease me about my body . most of the time , i try not to let it bother me because ultimately other people s comments are worthless and insignificant . if they don t like the way i look , then good for them they re not in control of my body or live in it every day , so their opinion is ultimately invalid .","294554":"yes , i believe that s possible . look at polyamorous people , for example they date and love multiple people at the same time , which leads me to believe that a lot of people have the capability of distinguishing various forms of love and applying them to different people in their lives . you can be in love two different people for two very different reasons . humans are naturally complex creatures , and love isn t necessarily reserved for only one person in our lives .","294555":"oh , hell no . why is a water bottle that expensive ? ! lmaoo . granted , i do like water bottles and use them at home and at work . but the most i ve spent was like on one of those yeti bottles that keeps drinks cold for two days .","294556":"followed ! ! xx also if any of my followers are looking for new people to follow , joanna is an absolute doll .","294557":"i m so sorry you re dealing with this . honestly i ve endured the same exact thing my entire life , so i understand completely how you feel . i also feel like i walk on eggshells around my family , particularly my mother , because she can change at any given second . she gives off the impression that she s a kind person , when really she feigns for sympathy and turns everything around to be a pillar against her . it also doesn t help that she s physically disabled , because that means my father and i have to do everything around the house for her , which includes her barking orders at us constantly . in the beginning , i didn t deal with it well at all . i m diagnosed with depression , anxiety , and bpd . for a very long time , i turned to self h rm to deal with my problems and attempted s icide a few times . even though i m clean from sh now , i still have urges every day and i ve relapsed every so often . as i got older , i turned to drugs alcohol . i m still battling with my dependence on alcohol because it was only very recently revealed to me how much of a problem it was . needless to say , my coping mechanisms aren t healthy . however therapy and medication has helped me a lot . not only in dealing with my moods and whatnot , but also for developing coping mechanisms and changes in thought patterns related to what i m going through with my family . talking to a therapist about what happens at home has been really beneficial to me , and if it s possible for you , i suggest you do the same . it s integral to find someone who listens . understands , and is on your side . i hope this all helps . xx","294558":"this is the last selfie i took","294559":"this reminds me of high school when we would have to say the word organism in a sentence in science class we would be so terrified of accidentally saying org sm . lmao .","294560":"haha , no . i ve never done that before .","294561":"no , but i do drink coffee every day lately iced coffee .","294562":"i would rather have new clothing . my phone works perfectly fine i don t need a new one .","294563":"aahh , i have so many ! ! i don t think i can choose just one . the x files , criminal minds , ncis , castle , bones , ghost adventures , ghost hunters , paranormal lockdown , ghost brothers , bob s burgers , bojack horseman , big mouth , parks and recreation , how i met your mother , and supernatural .","294564":"i either sleep in the fetal position with one arm under the pillow and one leg bent , or on my back .","294565":"i think i look more like my dad . we have similar facial features .","294566":"aesthetic photo of my wine date last night","294567":"good as hell by lizzo ! ! https www . youtube . com watch ? v smbmeogwsqe","294568":"i would rather be able to breathe underwater . i feel at peace when i m in the water , and i remember when i was young i used to hold my breath for as long as possible and just sit on the bottom of the pool , taking in the underwater silence . it was relaxing .","294569":"the first band i was ever interested in was linkin park when i was years old . their music spoke to me and really triggered my love and passion for music as a whole . i still listen to them to this day .","294570":"i would take a road trip to montreal , canada , with my boyfriend . when we were driving upstate to the wedding two weeks ago , we were only maybe miles away from montreal . we talked about it , and it s definitely something we want to do one day .","294571":"yes , i m a very loyal friend and would never reveal someone s secret to anyone else . i wouldn t want someone to do it to me , so why would i do it to someone who considers me a friend ? ?","294572":"yesterday , haha . my coworker straight up lied to my face about something she had no shame . she texted me and a few other coworkers we re all in a group chat together , saying she was projectile vomiting in the bathroom . so my one coworker went to the bathroom to check up on her , and she was literally just standing against the wall on her phone . honestly , we think she was trying to create a back story with us so that she could email hr and try to leave early . all she was saying in the morning was that she didn t want to work and just wanted to go in her friend s pool . guaranteed she was trying to make plans to leave .","294573":"this is a picture of me from around my boyfriend and i visited the central park zoo with a mm camera , and he snapped this shot of me .","294574":"honestly , i think only once and that s with my current boyfriend . my previous relationships conjured feelings of joy and happiness , but they didn t make me feel nearly as strong as i feel about my boyfriend .","294575":"girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . it s an autobiographical sketch of the author s in patient stay in a psychiatric facility after a s icide attempt , and it was really eye opening regarding mental illness in general . it was my first real introduction to mental health .","294576":"i would visit my best friend who lives in new hampshire . the area she lives in looks absolutely beautiful .","294577":"no , that would absolutely be counter productive . yelling at a child isn t going to make them learn a lesson , it s only going to encourage them to act out more . ideally , sitting down with your child and explaining to them why their behavior is wrong or dangerous and how it can affect them , and also providing support if necessary , would be the best course of action . however , every child is different . what works for some may not work for others . from my personal experience , getting yelled at as a child only made me more volatile , aggressive , and careless . it taught me that i couldn t trust my parents so i completely shut myself off from them .","294578":"you can do an educational or informative vlog regarding a subject you re passionate about that other people may not know about .","294579":"for the most part , yes . your own happiness is ultimately the most important , but i also do understand that a lot of people are more willing to help others rather than help themselves which i do the same thing too . simply put , you will not be able to have a successful , longstanding relationship with someone unless you understand that you need to actively work on improving yourself otherwise the other person will become frustrated , because people are supposed to grow together . by not helping yourself , you re doing not only yourself a disservice , but also those around you .","294580":"not at all ! ! i thoroughly enjoy your questions . you re doing a wonderful job .","294581":"this picture always makes me happy because i took it on one of my favorite vacations to montauk , new york .","294582":"i honestly have no idea who s running . i haven t done any research on the upcoming candidates .","294583":"i wouldn t say that i m addicted to any kinds of apps or social media . however , i use askfm and instagram the most .","294584":"no , i normally downplay my symptoms and pretend they don t exist , lmao .","294585":"i like the grunge style of the s .","294586":"no , he s almost a year older than me .","294587":"sneakers , obviously .","294588":"i like all of billie eilish s songs , haha .","294589":"yeah , i know what s appropriate and what s inappropriate in social and professional settings .","294590":"definitely not , lmao . that seems really vain .","294591":"nah , i like them because they re relaxing . i usually put some string lights on , turn off the overhead light , and light a candle at night to relax while i watch netflix .","294592":"not many at all . sometimes i ll scroll through social media in the morning when i m sitting outside waiting for am to roll around , but most of my usage happens after pm and i m only on sporadically . i spend most of my time answering questions on askfm , actually .","294593":"i started working out like a month or two ago , and i ve also cut down on the amount i drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes .","294594":"not very often these days ! ! usually i skip between feeling nothing then feeling everything and then some , but lately i ve been pretty content with everything .","294595":"unless this is referring to something in the media that i don t know about , i m going to assume you mean neon colored light fixtures . in that case , i like them a lot . i want different colored strips and bulbs for my room , haha .","294596":"i d rather call my boyfriend on the phone , but text everyone else . lol .","294597":"no , i ve never used a porta toilet before .","294598":"take my medication . i skipped my meds for like four days in a row once , and i was absolutely miserable , s icidal , and borderline self destructive . my medication keeps me stable for the most part .","294599":"honestly , i have really bad driving anxiety and that s partially because of the accidents i ve been in . no matter how cautious i am , i know that i can t control over drivers so i m always on high alert . i also have a really bad story about a car accident my boyfriend was in , but i don t want to scare you guys more , lmao .","294600":"i threw house parties when i was years old , yeah . i never had a desire to go to the club i don t like loud music in small spaces , crowds , or dancing .","294601":"i never went to nightclubs either , lmao . during those days , i was a delinquent or criminal , and a borderline alcoholic . i drank every night of the week , did illegal things with my friends , and somehow found a way to work go to college at the same time . there was nothing punk about it and it isn t something that should be idolized .","294602":"yeah , i m planning on getting a writing quill on my right forearm , as well as a traditional style dagger on the back of my right arm .","294603":"i have seven tattoos .","294604":"it s a little inconvenient but we ve gotten used to it . gaming isn t a priority , it s just something we all do for fun when we have the spare time .","294605":"haha , it s something we ve always discussed but never went through with it . and especially now it would be virtually impossible we rarely get to play all together these days due to everyone s conflicting work schedules .","294606":"i totally understand that , that s happened to me every time i ve gotten into an accident too . most recently , a work van rear ended my car and pushed me feet forward , totally destroyed the back of my car . the other bad accident i was in happened quite a few years ago , some old man drove right through a stop sign without stopping and i didn t have enough time to swerve out of the way , so i ended up t boning his car and totaled my car as a result .","294607":"nah , we don t stream . we ve always talked about it though especially when his friends are involved , the gameplay and conversations are always hilarious .","294608":"my boyfriend and i are going to play far cry tonight , it s what we played last night as well .","294609":"lol , it happens sometimes . i ve been in accidents every now again , as well as my best friend and my boyfriend . my best friend actually had a similar experience she was driving down the parkway and her tire completely blew out , which made her swerve and hit a guard rail . thankfully she was fine .","294610":"i haven t actually ran long distance in a very long time , lmao . i go in short spurts and then go back to power walking .","294611":"i don t post pictures of my friends or family on askfm , sorry .","294612":"my day has been fine . work went by relatively fast , thankfully , and i ve just been relaxing by scrolling through my questions drinking an iced coffee . i m planning on playing video games with my boyfriend tonight when he gets home from work actually , so i m looking forward to that . i don t really watch or listen to comedians , although i do appreciate comedy . george carlin used to be my favorite .","294613":"no , not at all . even when i was a child , i read either ya or adult novels not those kinds of adult novels , ya fools .","294614":"june was great because . . . i got my hair re colored shaved . i went to my cousin s wedding , which was hella fun . the publication i ve been working on since march was printed , which excited me because my name and writing is in the publication . i m not really looking forward to much in july , because i don t have anything really planned . however , i have the th of july off from work so that will be nice .","294615":"i always thought wolves represented me quite well . i ve always felt a bizarre , otherworldly connection to wolves from a very young age , which is the reason why i have a wolf tattoo .","294616":"i haven t played a board game in so long . however , i used to be a huge fan of parcheesi .","294617":"i mean , i would say my boyfriend but he s definitely the type to let me fall like of the way down before catching me as a joke , lmao . depending on how hard the floor is , of course . otherwise , i would say one of my coworkers with whom i m close . she s a genuinely nice , trustworthy person who wouldn t play games like that she would definitely catch me .","294618":"my best friend and i met in middle school ! ! we sat at the same lunch table bonded over our love for linkin park .","294619":"lasik eye surgery .","294620":"i use spotify , so i m not sure if there s a way to check which song i ve listened to the most . however , the artists i ve listened to the most are likely macklemore , watsky , grandson , or matt maeson .","294621":"i m currently listening to a specific playlist i made . so the first three songs that come on shuffle are bonfire by childish gambino the search by nf truth hurts by lizzo","294622":"my boyfriend and i were sorta long distance for a short period of time . when i moved away to college , we stayed in a relationship for a few months before breaking up . we got back together after i suddenly had to come back home , and i ended up staying home for a number of reasons .","294623":"i m currently reading game of thrones by george r . r . martin .","294624":"i played tennis during high school in gym class , but that was it . haha .","294625":"my biggest complaint is that the camera doesn t work very well anymore , and it doesn t take high resolution pictures . it s really shoddy compared to newer phones .","294626":"here s a picture of my boyfriend s dog . he s a black german shepherd lab mix .","294627":"no , i m not vegetarian or vegan . however , i use soy milk in my coffee if that counts for anything , haha .","294628":"starter spinach artichoke dip , taquitos , or caprese salad . main course some sort of steak or veggie burger , with steamed or saut ed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes . dessert good ole fashioned cheesecake .","294629":"mainly first person shooters and open world rpgs . my favorite games are fallout and skyrim , although i also play assassin s creed , destiny , far cry , minecraft , bioshock , and a few others .","294630":"my paternal grandparents are , yes .","294631":"i ve honestly just been working , although i haven t worked on the weekend in the past three weeks , which is a bittersweet feeling , haha . i got my hair done two weekends ago , last weekend i went to a wedding , and this past weekend i just wanted to relax .","294632":"no , i m still relatively young so aging isn t a concern of mine .","294633":"i never had a punk phase to begin with , lol .","294634":"we had a mutual friend , someone who i went to middle school with and then went to the high school my boyfriend went to . we went out all together one night and him and i hit it off immediately .","294635":"no , i m growing my hair out .","294636":"depends how interested i am in the game and the dlc . i have a few games that i like playing , but i probably wouldn t want to spend money on a dlc because they cost just as much as a regular game at this point .","294637":"something that i m not really comfortable talking about on askfm anymore .","294638":"last night , i ate some pork with a side of broccoli with cheese sauce .","294639":"lol . to be fair , they ve changed their logo a lot over the years .","294640":"i rock back forth when i m feeling anxious or overwhelmed and it calms me down . it s actually a very common coping mechanism . i don t really know the actual science behind it , but it is comforting to a lot of people .","294641":"you ll have to be more specific . which messages are you talking about ? ?","294642":"it s ok ! ! it s the symbol for the band linkin park .","294643":"i play video games , but nothing on the phone .","294644":"not really , no . feel free to ask me questions , though","294645":"yeah , june went by super fast for me ! ! i suppose the highlight was my cousin s wedding last weekend , but i also got my hair colored the weekend before that , so that was a highlight too .","294646":"no , thankfully i ve never had acne . occasionally i ll get pimples on my face but it isn t very often .","294647":"no , i ve never made my own before . i just buy hummus from the store , normally sabre brand .","294648":"yeah , you used frequently correctly . however , it should be she and i . . . not her and i . . . in the beginning of the sentence .","294649":"sorta , but not really . school was my escape from my home life , but at the same time , i didn t have many friends and i rarely saw anyone outside of school . i studied and worked hard most of the time because i wanted to get into a good college leave .","294650":"how much i managed to clean today despite waking up hungover from last night . i did two loads of laundry , dusted and vacuumed the living room and dining room , wiped down all of my furniture in my room , vacuumed my room , reorganized my belongings , and put fresh sheets and pillowcases on the bed .","294651":"linkin park . their discography is pretty diverse and they have a hell of a lot of songs , haha .","294652":"mcdonalds , if i had to choose between the two . they have pretty good coffee .","294653":"i honestly have no clue . i graduated from high school years ago .","294654":"yeah , i m my hardest critic .","294655":"definitely not , haha . i don t really wear eyeliner unless i m trying to do a wing , but i usually fail miserably .","294656":"life has been all right , it s had its normal ups downs like usual . i m currently feeling pretty good rn actually , i have a lot of motivation so i ve been cleaning for like four hours .","294657":"no , i ve only been triggered on rare occasions , usually in things like television shows or movies . it has to be pretty graphic though .","294658":"i don t really follow anyone on other social media besides my friends a few youtubers , lol . i follow a lot of the cast and crew from rooster teeth achievement hunter , as well as gamers such as markiplier and jacksepticeye .","294659":"lol . i ll promote la croix any day , it s legit the only way i ll drink water . polar sparkling water is good too .","294660":"the lord of the rings trilogy . i can watch them endlessly .","294661":"depends on how your eagerness affects you . if it s putting you at a disadvantage , then it s a flaw . however , if it empowers you , then it s a positive attribute .","294662":"la croix sparkling water ! ! i ve been cleaning nonstop since pm and it s been keeping me hydrated , it tastes great .","294663":"no . just because you believe in something doesn t mean that it s necessarily true . a lot of people believe in things that are generally inaccurate or false .","294664":"no , he wasn t in the army . he actually wanted to go so badly , but he couldn t for medical reasons .","294665":"no , although he does have depressive tendencies due to his ptsd .","294666":"i already planned my next tattoo . it s going to be a writing quill i m putting it on my right forearm .","294667":"sushi , even though i ate it last wednesday . lmao . i can always go for some sushi .","294668":"no , i don t like the way watches look on me .","294669":"sure , that sounds like fun .","294670":"going on askfm , lmao .","294671":"uh , i don t even know what that is . lmao .","294672":"you re asking the wrong person , my friend .","294673":"i wouldn t use the terms hateful or bigoted , but i would consider them to be fairly closeminded and ignorant . it s perfectly acceptable and very progressive to teach children about different s xual orientations and genders , and it leads to further tolerance , understanding and acceptance later in life .","294674":"nothing makes me blush . i m not really ashamed to talk about anything i m very hard to embarrass .","294675":"i d be pissed , obviously . i would contact my insurance company see if it s covered .","294676":"sometimes pop , but mostly rap . it doesn t stop my mind , though . lol .","294677":"i m not really a big fan of horror movies .","294678":"depends on what the secret is and who the person was who was keeping it from me .","294679":"it could lead to s x addiction if someone is replacing actual coping mechanisms with the act of s x . they become dependent on the actual feeling of an org sm .","294680":"i have rudimentary knowledge , sure .","294681":"no , i haven t heard of that study . that s an interesting perspective , though .","294682":"you mean through s x ? ? probably not . i wouldn t want him to feel obligated to have s x , and the act of having s x does not make someone less depressed . he s still going to feel the same way when it s over , and he may even adopt feelings of guilt because he may not enjoy it . if my boyfriend was depressed , i would sit down and talk to him about his feelings and make a plan to try to make him feel better , whether that s through medication or therapy or finding new hobbies that are healthy .","294683":"i m a bit split on affirmative action because it has both pros and cons . on the one hand , i do agree that disadvantaged groups should be allowed to have the same treatment as advantaged groups due to historical background , it s sorta like making up for lost time . however , at the same time , it could lead to preferential treatment , i . e . colleges trying to meet a quota regarding percentages of students who are from minority groups . in addition , affirmative action leads people to suppress themselves and view themselves as disadvantaged more . while it s healthy to understand the history of oppression and discrimination , it may lead people to not want to progress further and see beyond their lack of advantage . they may not want to better themselves anymore because they see it as part of their identity .","294684":"i m not an expert on s x , so i honestly don t know , lol .","294685":"i haven t had the time or the inspiration . normally when i get home from work , i m totally burnt out from writing all day so i just want to relax .","294686":"again , it depends on the person . some people have s x in healthy manners and it gives them a sense of intimacy with their partner . however , other times it s an unhealthy coping mechanism for some people .","294687":"occasionally , but it s been quite a few months since i ve written poetry .","294688":"it depends on the person . you can t really quantify something like that as a whole because each person has their own comfort levels regarding s x and what they deem to be often enough in their own lives .","294689":"they re welcome if they insist on it , but i don t invite anyone over to my house . if i m seeing a friend , i always either meet them out somewhere or go to their house .","294690":"i have no opinions on it . it s just a clothing item .","294691":"depends on the day . usually i ll have two large cups of coffee in the morning on the weekends , while during the week i ll only have one cup in the morning and then one cup in the afternoon .","294692":"i posted a picture of my tattoos last night , if you feel like scrolling . i have them on my shoulder blades , my upper and lower arm , the top of my thigh , the back of my calf , my ankle , and my ribs .","294693":"i ve never heard her music before .","294694":"no , i ve actually never tried before .","294695":"lol , no . all of my tattoos are visible and everyone knows about them .","294696":"for some people , yeah . it s never bothered me though .","294697":"you must move through pain if you wish to be happy , for he who stands still , feels the full force of misery .","294698":"no , it s the same as it s always been . i m not putting any effort into improving relations because i honestly don t care enough .","294699":"yeah , but they have to acknowledge that they can improve and that what they re currently doing isn t good . however , outsiders cannot change their loved ones , friends , etc etc . to try to do so would be manipulative .","294700":"i can t even imagine myself one month from now , let alone one year . lmao . i could be completely different with perhaps greater confidence , or i could be the same as i am today . it all depends on what i ve gone through or accomplished within the next year .","294701":"when they won t acknowledge that what they re doing is wrong or hurtful , have no desire to change , and aren t putting in any effort into the relationship or friendship .","294702":"i m absolutely terrible at both , lmao . however , that doesn t stop me from playing . pool is one of my favorite games , especially if there s a pool table at the bar .","294703":"any time my boyfriend and i have gone on a small weekend vacation are wonderful moments . we don t have responsibilities for once in our lives , and we can do what we please with no restrictions . we normally go to upstate new york or montauk , new york .","294704":"i would likely either move abroad or go down south to perhaps north carolina . i would probably have a similar job as what i have now , which is a writer editor for a publishing company , where i could write articles and press releases as well as help in publishing items . that , or i would settle down and try to be a published author . i imagine having a small , quaint house with a lot of windows and wood furnishings . there would be plants and animals everywhere , and it would be a place where my friends could come if they have nowhere else to go . i would like my future home to sorta have an open door policy because i would want others to feel comfortable .","294705":"yeah , i got kicked out of a wal mart once because my friend stole something , so we were asked to leave . i m not sure if we were necessarily banned from there , but still i haven t gone back , haha . this was years ago .","294706":"i m not really a hermit , no . i usually see my friends once per week , and occasionally i ll go to parties but it s rather rare because they only happen on holidays really i . e . , my coworker threw a fourth of july party last night i went , it was actually pretty fun .","294707":"yes , for the most part . i m slowly working towards my dreams goals , because unfortunately they aren t an overnight thing . sometimes the process can be a bit daunting or worrisome , but it s absolutely worth it in the end .","294708":"leigh means dweller by the wood or clearing .","294709":"hearing a loved one laugh or seeing them smile immersing yourself in nature having the first cup of coffee of the day having a sense of accomplishment and pride when you did well on something you were previously worried about receiving positive reinforcement from a trusted friend , family member or colleague and being listened to and validated .","294710":"one of my coworkers who s been pissing me off asked if i wanted to hang out today , so i lied and told her it was laundry day so i wouldn t be able to see her . lmao .","294711":"there s quite a few of us ! !","294712":"another tattoo , lmao . i haven t gotten around to making an appointment or a consultation yet , though . i know which artist i want to do the tattoo , her work is amazing .","294713":"i don t know if this is considered mexican food , but i love classic rice beans , as well as empanadas . my boyfriend s grandmother makes amazing empanadas and her rice beans are so delicious . every time she makes them all , she ends up making a huge batch that lasts my boyfriend and me two days .","294714":"i m not close to my family at all , tbh . the person i m closest to is perhaps my brother , but we don t generally speak to each other unless we re at a family event .","294715":"i don t believe perfection exists . we re human beings we re naturally flawed creatures , so nothing we do or think will be absolutely perfect . we re prone to mistakes the only thing we can do to prevent them in the future is to learn from them .","294716":"littlesha i love morgan s no nonsense attitude , her maturity and outlook on life , and her opinionated nature . she s not afraid to express herself and stand true to her beliefs , and i find that really admirable . misphire i love steph s passion toward her interests , whether it s her family or writing or astrology . i ve always found her to be so creative as well , and we operate on the same wavelength when it comes to our perspectives and what we find humorous . lol . urlsareshittbh i love danny s outspoken nature ability to express himself , as well as his interest in and passion for animals . his vegan lifestyle makes me want to try to go vegan myself . i also find that i can relate to him a lot due to similar experiences .","294717":"alongside happiness , i also do want to be more independent and express myself more creatively , work toward my ultimate goal of being a published writer not work related , but like a fiction novel or book or poetry .","294718":"yeah , i know one or two people whom i would consider a hypocrite . they never want to admit they re wrong either , and they demonize other people for things that they do or are themselves .","294719":"last night , i ate a home cooked well , bbq d black bean burger with vegan cheese , and it tasted delicious . i also had cold pasta salad . last time i had takeout fast food was yesterday morning , lol . i ordered an egg sandwich from dunkin when i went to grab an iced coffee .","294720":"she s extremely compassionate toward other people especially animals . she s so passionate about the welfare of animals and it s admirable .","294721":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope you do too","294722":"nothing extraordinary . we usually have squirrels , rabbits , raccoons , possums , different types of birds , and i see bats at night occasionally . if you go out east more or down towards the beaches , there are wild deer .","294723":"yeah , thankfully it did . after the storm passed the humidity went totally down today it s absolutely gorgeous . not a single cloud in the sky .","294724":"yeah , i was in nassau county we got that , but also the really bad rain hail . i couldn t believe it was hailing outside , i ve never seen that before . i thought my windshield was going to break .","294725":"i don t have a pet currently , but i used to have two fish , lol . and yeah , i would talk to them every day . usually things like , hey buddy ! how are you doing today ? ! you hungry ? !","294726":"omg , i know . yesterday was so disgusting outside . i was driving out west to the party it started downpouring rain and there was hail the size of quarters for like minutes . it was absolutely terrifying . did you get that by you ? ?","294727":"this is my current laptop wallpaper","294728":"truth hurts by lizzo . i m obsessed with this song . https www . youtube . com watch ? v p hmxdsvzi","294729":"this is pretty vague . who s ugly why would i care ? ?","294730":"right now , i m thinking that it s an absolutely gorgeous day outside and i want to take advantage of the sunshine . i don t want to go anywhere per say , but i do want to spend some time in the backyard this afternoon maybe get a nice tan .","294731":"my weekend is going good ! ! yesterday , i got all of my errands done in the morning then i went to a fourth of july party in the afternoon evening , which was hella fun . it s sunday morning i woke up not too long ago slightly hungover , lol . i just made a cup of coffee , and i m planning on sifting through my inbox for a little bit before starting laundry and sunbathing outside with a good book .","294732":"which symbol one are you talking about ? ?","294733":"here are all of my tattoos ! !","294734":"yes ! ! i m currently at a fourth of july party at my coworker s house .","294735":"yeah , i smoke every few weeks or so .","294736":"vegetables , i . e . cold mushrooms , carrot sticks , tomato mozzarella salad , etc etc .","294737":"the only thing that bothers me about him is that he s a fairly messy person . he has a bad habit of leaving cups on the table , throwing his clothes on the ground , etc etc . he s gotten a lot better over the past year , at the very least , but when he works a lot , his bedroom becomes atrocious because he doesn t have the energy or the time to clean it , lol .","294738":"nothing , haha . i haven t done much today except eat breakfast , have two cups of coffee , and run errands .","294739":"my boyfriend ! ! i m hopefully seeing him tomorrow night .","294740":"anywhere in nature , particularly among the trees .","294741":"lol , no . i can t whistle when blowing outwards , but i can while sucking inwards .","294742":"i would much rather live in the mountains . i ve lived near the beach my entire life i still don t really go there , haha . i like the water , but i ve never really liked the beach itself because it s always busy with families .","294743":"pursue a relationship with someone where you accept love them for who they are , not for a fantasy version of them that differs from the truth . i was very young in my last relationship , and over time i noticed that i was in love with the idea of him , not so much him as he actually was . i eventually broke up with him , for a variety of other unrelated reasons as well , but it was a conclusion i came to perhaps months later .","294744":"ah , i can relate to this a lot . my boyfriend and i both work a lot he works like hours per week , and our schedules are totally opposite so i only see him once per week even though we live close to each other . have you tried other avenues of seeing each other ? i . e . , facetiming , skyping , snapchat or facebook video , etc etc . i also don t know how you feel about talking on the phone , but i talk to my boyfriend every night it helps a lot on the days we can t see each other .","294745":"i like the regular audio versions the lyric videos , so i can follow the lyrics on the screen while the song plays .","294746":"i think the longest i ve been awake was hours . i didn t sleep for two days , i guess that equals out to , which doesn t seem like much but it definitely caused me a lot of trouble since i was a high school student at the time , haha .","294747":"anyone who pours the milk first is a heathen .","294748":"i don t have much experience with reading the books , since i m only maybe pages into the first book in the series . however , it s definitely a lot more interesting , and it goes further in depth that the television show ever does .","294749":"i don t believe i can choose just one tbh . all of the road trips vacations i ve been on with my boyfriend are all happy , delightful memories ranging from when we go upstate to when we visit the east end and montauk . we even traveled to austin , texas , a few years ago and that was an amazing memory .","294750":"they re both inherently valuable , but it just depends on how when you apply those traits throughout your life . you can be a creative person , but without the application of that creativity , you or your talents aren t very valuable . the same can be said for knowledge you may have a plethora of knowledge within you , but if you don t push forward and apply that knowledge to a greater cause , it s not valuable at all .","294751":"songs the entire skyrim soundtrack sleeping sickness by city colour books girl interrupted by susanna kaysen the harry potter series by jk rowling films heathers the lord of the rings trilogy","294752":"i don t normally enjoy the heat , but if it s bright sunny outside , then i ll sit in my backyard with a book and sunbathe , lol .","294753":"last week , actually ! ! for my cousin s wedding , my boyfriend and i stayed in a hotel about minutes away from the reception venue . we left early sunday morning to come back home .","294754":"yes , i m usually the designated direction giver when my boyfriend and i go on road trips . he drives and i point him in the direction he needs to go .","294755":"cont my myopia has increased but i m afraid to go check it out . can you relate ? sorry just need to rant . yeah , i can definitely relate to this ! ! i ve been wearing glasses since i was a toddler , and my eyesight has only gotten worse as i ve gotten older . it s never stabilized either , and i think that partially has to do with my astigmatism . honestly , contacts didn t help my eyesight at all and they made my eyes itchy and irritated . do you wear glasses as well ? it may help more , but i do understand the fear of going to the doctor . i haven t gone in three years to get my eyes re examined , even though i should ideally go annually .","294756":"i mostly drink beer or white wine these days . i rarely order cocktails unless it s a margarita at a spanish restaurant . i ve never liked the taste of whisky . i also love mojitos , but most places don t make them correctly .","294757":"most humans are selfish and greedy .","294758":"sometimes i do , but what s in the past is in the past . you can t do anything to change it so there s no use in regretting it .","294759":"i like eating calamari on the beach .","294760":"sorta , but not in an overbearing way .","294761":"yeah , i value my alone time a lot . i spend most of my days surrounded by people , so i like spending time by myself .","294762":"a few hours at the most . sometimes i ll check social media if i have the time in the morning before work . i don t use the internet again for recreational purposes at least until after i get home from work around pm .","294763":"yeah , one of my cousins doesn t like chocolate . i m also not a huge fan of chocolate either . i can t eat it straight , it gives me a stomach ache .","294764":"uh , some criminal activities that i don t feel like explaining on askfm . lmao .","294765":"my boyfriend s mother dying , my best friend s father dying , and my boyfriend s dog dying .","294766":"my back hurts , but that s not unusual . however , my anxiety is skyrocketing rn . i have no idea why and it s bothering me a lot .","294767":"not really , no . everyone who i enjoyed following on askfm who have left , i keep in contact with on other social media sites .","294768":"no , i prefer to be left alone especially if i m sick or depressed . otherwise i just feel like a burden on whoever i m with .","294769":"uh , don t call me babe . that s pretty weird . i m doing well , though . the magazine i ve been working on at work was just shipped to the office i got to take one home ! ! my name is listed in the contributing staff section as a content writer , which made me really happy .","294770":"my first paying job was a cashier position at a pharmacy . i stayed there for about four years and was promoted to photo lab technician and then lab supervisor . i also worked as a pharmacy technician for a brief period of time .","294771":"i remember when i was in middle school high school , napoleon dynamite was just released everyone was obsessed with it . i couldn t even watch it though , it was so cringe y to me and super awkward and boring , lol .","294772":"i feel the most comfortable in a regular tank top , a long hoodie or a cardigan , skinny jeans , and knee high boots .","294773":"wow , this made me emotional . thank you so much this means so much to me .","294774":"no , that wouldn t offend me . i would be appreciative of it being given to me regardless of the value of the item .","294775":"i just simply don t have faith in any sort of higher being like that , regardless of whether it s the catholic god or an entity from any other religion . i place my faith in science , nature , humans , animals , etc etc .","294776":"aah , so many ! ! my favorite movies that i ve seen multiple times are heathers , american psycho , sweeney todd , les miserables , i am not a serial killer , the crow , the punisher , queen of the damned , the number , secret window , and the shining .","294777":"i m the same as i am on askfm , except more corporeal .","294778":"sometimes , sure . honestly , most of them are really dark either that , or they re like dad jokes , haha .","294779":"i ve never purchased used clothing before , but i always wear my boyfriend s clothing lol .","294780":"no , i don t believe in god . i ve been an atheist for as long as i can remember .","294781":"i usually always order spicy tuna rolls and or salmon avocado rolls . they re my favorite .","294782":"k . flay just came out with a new

my dslr camera at her mother s house which i keep forgetting to take back .","294785":"sorta , haha . i eat healthy and exercise , but my coping mechanisms are rather unhealthy and i drink perhaps a little too much .","294786":"sometimes , yeah . i put my boyfriend s happiness before mine at times because i care about his happiness more than my own .","294787":"cannolis , if they count ! !","294788":"i ve never been to europe , so i really don t know . it wouldn t surprise me though .","294789":"october i love the changing leaves , the chilly weather , the ability to finally wear

ranch doritos , but i usually eat veggie chips .","294792":"no , i m rather weak both physically and emotionally , haha . i give into my urges too often and i have no concept of self control . even though i ve gone through some traumatic things , i haven t really recovered from them and they still weigh me down significantly .","294793":"not really , no . at least not the stereotypical concept that says that everyone has only one soul mate . i believe that if soul mates did exist then it could apply to several different people for various reasons , whether the relationship is romantic or platonic .","294794":"i don t know most americans , so i really have no idea . i hardly know any people on the small island in which i live , lol . that s nothing compared to the millions of people who live in america .","294795":"lol no , i m very far from being patriotic .","294796":"no , i don t hate change . sometimes i embrace it because change makes life interesting , and it s good to mix things up a bit .","294797":"i m doing fine . i went to my cousin s wedding last weekend , which was a lot of fun . my boyfriend and i ended up driving five hours to upstate new york and made a small weekend trip out of it . other than that , things have been rather ordinary and uneventful .","294798":"yeah , all the time . i m always thinking about how my life could have turned out or how i would be different had i not started self h rming and similar things .","294799":"no , it has nothing to do with me really so it doesn t affect me . if someone doesn t like me , then that s more of a them problem because they came to that conclusion , and unless they re going out of their way to damage my life , it doesn t bother me at all .","294800":"scars from severe skin picking also known as dermatillomania .","294801":"i honestly have no clue , haha . i m also not home so i can t check to see what brand it is .","294802":"i have no idea who you re talking about .","294803":"here s my new improved bitmoji instead ! !","294804":"i answered this two hours ago .","294805":"oh , haha . either way , it doesn t matter . what cadence decides to do in her spare time is her business

the time exactly . i know it was in the morning hours , though .","294809":"i didn t even know askfm had a recommended friends list , lol . guess they re trying to be like fb now , smh .","294810":". . . that s sorta weird that you knew she reactivated her account before she even started answering questions .","294811":"that s such a bullsh t excuse , lol . it s impossible for every employee to run around and immediately clean a machine after a customer has used it before the next customer starts using it , especially when it comes to treadmills and bikes . it s as simple as this clean up after yourself . wipe your own sweat off the machine and make it ready for the next person . if you have a problem with that , then don t go to the f cking gym .","294812":"whenever i order italian food , i always either get chicken parm or eggplant parm , haha . i also love caprese salads .","294813":"i m fine with regular american cheese if i m at a bbq at home . but if i go to a restaurant and have an option , then i ll usually order cheddar cheese .","294814":"lobster bisque , new england clam chowder , broccoli cheddar , and hearty vegetable .","294815":"it really depends on the kind of sadness , if that makes sense lol . i have really somber periods of sadness , where all i do is cry and listen to sad music . i have destructive sadness , where i need to escape from my emotions and get drunk and or high . and i have quiet sadness , where i sit in silence and do absolutely nothing or try to sleep it off .","294816":"i seldom wear makeup to begin with , unless i m going out somewhere and have the patience to put some makeup on . i also do wear less foundation in the summer months anyway , mostly because my face gets tan and i don t feel like dishing out the money to buy a darker shade of foundation . my go to look is similar to my makeup style in my current profile picture , if you can see it . neutral eyeshadow shades in reds , pinks , and browns mascara a small bit of contouring with highlighter and a nude or red lip .","294817":"well thank you , i appreciate it","294818":"i like sauteed spinach the most . i could eat spinach literally every day of my life not get tired of it .","294819":"i absolutely love cheez its , lmaoo . they re my all time favorite snack . the regular , classic ones are delicious , but i also really like the cheez it grooves in white cheddar .","294820":"haha , aw . thank you i wish i shared your sentiments . i honestly don t know how i would be as a parent , i was raised terribly and i wouldn t want to find myself in a position where i would be emulating their parenting techniques without realizing it .","294821":"yes ! ! that s a really big deal to me , and i ve only ever seen maybe one or two people completely walk away from the machine without cleaning it first . there are cleaning stations all over the gym i used to go to , and there s really no excuse as to why you can t squirt some cleaner on a paper towel and wipe the machine down quickly . smh .","294822":"i don t even know if i want kids to begin with , tbh . it s something i ve always thought about and was never completely comfortable with the idea of me having children .","294823":"i don t remember , tbh . i generally never feel old because everyone i see on a regular basis is older than me .","294824":"i ve been wearing glasses since i was a toddler .","294825":"it has helped me tremendously , yeah . i struggle with mental illness and i started attending therapy because i was having s icidal thoughts and didn t know what to do with myself anymore . i went to my general practitioner she referred me to a counseling center that had both therapists and psychiatrists , so i made appointments to see both .","294826":"yes , i ve been in therapy for two years now . i used to see my therapist weekly , but a few months ago we changed it to every two weeks .","294827":"it isn t my all time favorite song because i don t have one , but i ve been listening to soco amaretto lime by brand new non stop for the past hours . i ended up drunkenly listening to it when i got home last night sobbed my eyes out . https www . youtube . com watch ? v rkbrdjkytye","294828":"yeah , i have generalized anxiety and social anxiety . so i m pretty much worrying nonstop experiencing racing thoughts on occasion .","294829":"depends on my mood in that moment . sometimes i ll order a glass of pinot grigio , other times i ll order a light beer . i used to drink ipas a lot , but they have so many carbs in them that i didn t feel comfortable drinking them anymore .","294830":"things are going fine at the moment . i m honestly just so mentally exhausted i feel like i m burnt out from working , even though i had a three day weekend last week . i find myself questioning if it s worth it to call out or leave work early , even though i really have no reasonable excuse . i m just drained .","294831":"yeah , i exercise every days .","294832":"above all else , i need sleep . i m not talking about a regular night of sleep , though . i m talking about an entire weekend where the only responsibility i have is to lay in bed . i need a few days to really relax my brain and recharge .","294833":"yes , i did . i follow some youtubers on twitter who were posting about him the day he was found , it brought me to tears . i never watched etika s videos or really knew who he was , unfortunately . but this is just further evidence that celebrities are human and prone to depression , anxiety , etc etc . , just like the rest of us . no one is immune and we need to keep having conversations about mental health to make reaching out more acceptable and less stigmatizing .","294834":"i m fairly flexible . it s funny because i actually freaked my coworkers out today because of how far i can bend my arms back , lmao .","294835":"just a headache . i ate and took advil , and i ve been fine for a while now .","294836":"i can t drink it straight , but i used to drink vodka cranberry cocktails occasionally .","294837":"i believe i ordered it from modcloth .","294838":"i ve been at work for almost five hours .","294839":"haha , no . what i do in my time outside of work isn t their business and they don t care . if i showed up to work drunk , then that would obviously be a different story .","294840":"i wasn t tired , no . i still got more than hours of sleep .","294841":"somewhat , but only towards myself if that makes sense . i don t work in groups so all of the expectations and pressures are on myself .","294842":"i made it quite evident in my answers last night that i was drinking .","294843":"i m fine at the moment . i just got to work and i have like minutes to spare before i have to walk inside . i m . . . sorta ? . . . hungover but it isn t anything terrible . although it has been quite a while since i felt this way , lmao .","294844":"yeah , i m generally in a much happier mood when i m drinking

then i won t go out drinking with a friend . i would rather spend time with him than with any of my friends .","294849":"occasionally , yeah . sometimes i ll wake up around or am and not be able to go back to bed because i m too awake .","294850":"no , i normally don t notice it at all .","294851":"no , i m not sleeping yet .","294852":"i don t have an answer to this question , my friend . i m not an expert in psychiatry or neuropsychiatry .","294853":"this is a stupid fucking question . unless someone is lucid dreaming , they don t have control over their dreams . anyone with a basic understanding of sleep knows that .","294854":"is this a serious question ? lmaoo . they re out of my control . i can t help but have dreams or nightmares . it s unpredictable and i have no control over them .","294855":"depends on the day . sometimes i ll have a buttered croissant , or a yogurt parfait , or an egg sandwich .","294856":"obviously not ? lmaoo . that s why they re called nightmares , not dreams .","294857":"two to three times per day . i normally eat breakfast , sometimes lunch , and then dinner .","294858":"no , i can t remember my first time . it was either during my sophomore year in high school when i experimented with drinking for the first time or my first year of college .","294859":"yeah , sometimes . it depends on my mood while i m actually going to bed . sometimes i ll sleep like a rock , while other times i ll have nightmares .","294860":"friendships happen naturally , not upon request . i appreciate the acknowledgement but you can t make friends with someone by simply asking to be their friend .","294861":"uh , drunk . lmao . otherwise , i m feeling fine . i had therapy this afternoon then my friend asked me to meet for dinner and a drink , so i complied . now i m a bit tipsy and going to bed soon .","294862":"one of my cousins . she s absolutely gorgeous . angular face , dark brown curly hair , and a beautiful figure . she also has a great personality and her husband is just as charming and funny .","294863":"not at my own house , no . i sometimes go to bbqs at my friends houses though .","294864":"i m left handed .","294865":"three weeks ago , i think .","294866":"occasionally , yeah . we had a flash flood warning the other day , from what i remember , because it was storming all morning .","294867":"either skyrim or fallout .","294868":"i don t believe i ve ever learned how to write short hand , no .","294869":"thanks","294870":"no , i don t have gerd , nor do i know anyone who has it .","294871":"i try to exercise every other day , but sometimes i get lazy and only exercise every three days , lol .","294872":"not really . i ate steak and vegetables for dinner and had a few glasses of white wine . i totally missed dessert , lol .","294873":"lmaooo . omg .","294874":"sunday afternoon when i hugged my boyfriend goodbye after i dropped him off at his house after the trip .","294875":"don t settle for anything less than what you deserve . it s perfectly fine to be picky when dating , and even if you re already in a relationship , you shouldn t be anything less than happy with your partner and your progress together . life is too short to settle down with something that simply feels comfortable . you deserve someone who will not only make you feel at home , but also be a beacon of support , a source of encouragement , someone who brings out the best version of yourself .","294876":"call an exterminator .","294877":"haha , no . i find those super annoying .","294878":"it feels like you re coming home for the first time .","294879":"yes , they surprisingly get along . my boyfriend doesn t like my mother at all , though , but he plays nice for my sake .","294880":"no , i don t have any food allergies or anything . i only have seasonal allergies to things like pollen .","294881":"usually i get on the treadmill and exercise for a while .","294882":"reading , writing , painting , playing video games , photography , and seeing my friends .","294883":"no , i have no desire to try that .","294884":"i wake up at am every morning .","294885":"i find the concepts to be interesting , but i m not sure if i necessarily believe in them .","294886":"yeah , my parents are notorious for doing that . growing up , my mother in particular always made me feel guilty about my interests , which has led me to clam up about everything i m interested in or doing as an adult .","294887":"dark humor , lmao . i laugh at gory movies and i especially love dark comedy movies , like heathers .","294888":"lol , this defines most of my social experiences . i always get the feeling that no one is actually listening to me but i finish the story anyway .","294889":"surprisingly , no . all of the bridges i ve burned happened a few years ago and i ve been content with my group of friends for a while now . however , there is one friend with whom i thought i should cut ties , but i m still unsure of where we stand . we have a good time when we see each other , but they ve royally screwed up on multiple occasions and i m not sure how many more chances i m willing to give .","294890":"honestly ? no . it s in our human nature to aggravate conflict . we re creatures of habit , and any form of change is immediately met with hesitation and skepticism . most important figures who are in control of the world are also ruled by greed and gluttony , and if something does not fit their preconceived viewpoint of the world , then they reject it . i don t think we ll see world peace , at least not in this lifetime if the human race is still standing .","294891":"hello i m doing well . i m watching a true crime docu series , drinking some alcohol , and scrolling through my askfm questions . i should probably be asleep , but i m not tired yet .","294892":"the truth is , everything is catered to the male gaze , and even though realistically beauty has no importance to what s significant in life , it s become conventional and standard to place that importance on beauty in order to quantify some sort of worth in society . from early times , women have always catered to men . the idea of a woman s beauty has been deemed as important to further serve the men in their lives . in the current age , that has manifested in different makeup forms , body types , body hair styles , etc etc . women are told men won t like you with short hair or men don t like when women are not shaved , and so on . it s become so typical and commonplace to see these standards of beauty and most people don t acknowledge how misogynistic it can be .","294893":"thankfully , i feel like my vocabulary is pretty diverse , due in part to my studies in grammar and literature while in college . the words come to me naturally , even words that i notice i haven t used in quite some time , depending on the situation and what message i m trying to convey .","294894":"while i do have a lot of terrible and depression decisions that made my life worse , for the sake of askfm i ll answer this on a positive note . deciding to stick through with college graduate changed my life , and for the greater good . i struggled a lot with my grades and juggling assignments , especially with my mental health being as bad as it was , but i knew that if i dropped out then i would feel worse . i stuck through with my studies and ended up graduating with a . gpa . it s changed my life for the better because i wouldn t have had the job opportunities i ve had , had i not graduated .","294895":"in theory , yes . it s technically fair but in application , no . for example , even if your boss looks down on you , in some circumstances you simply cannot treat them the same way otherwise you ll lose your job . and while some people may think that s worth losing their job over , other people can t afford that to happen to them . the reality is , sometimes we have no choice but to deal with being treated poorly by people . however , in most cases we do need to take a step above them and take the higher ground , because by behaving like them you re only stooping down to their level .","294896":"girl interrupted by susanna kaysen is perhaps the best , and most important , book i ve read to date . it s definitely not a complex novel , but it s an autobiographical sketch of a woman s lessons she learned while staying in a psychiatric ward after being diagnosed with bpd . it was the first book i read that introduced me to the importance of mental health and also was my first insight into depression , anxiety , and bpd . i was able to relate to many of the characters , which was my first clue that i was struggling with mental health myself .","294897":"i used to prioritize other people s needs desires over my own . as i ve gotten older , i ve learned that my own needs , desires , and happiness are just as important as those of others . i m now acknowledging that i need to prioritize myself moreso than ever these days , because i cannot help others until i ultimately help myself . i m learning that i deserve happiness and recognition .","294898":"well , i just got back from the gas station and picked up alcohol , so ask me questions since i ll be drinking staying up for a while","294899":"somewhat , yes . i never really responded well to positive affirmations when i was struggling , because it simply seemed unrealistic to me . however , i do appreciate gentle approaches to reality and encouragement . the acknowledgment of the struggles and hardships while also offering sound advice that isn t a blanket statement or falsely confident .","294900":"seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile , watching the rain outside the window , drinking iced coffee in the morning , spending lazy early mornings with coffee and cigarettes with my boyfriend , positive reinforcement , sleeping well , true crime documentaries , reading a good book , painting , writing something i m proud of , and playing video games .","294901":"went to bed early the other night because i knew i needed the extra sleep , instead of staying awake to prolong the night .","294902":"a meme that i saw on facebook , lmao .","294903":"very much so , yes . i have generalized and social anxiety , so i m basically worried about everything and overthink everything .","294904":"because i m afraid something could go wrong , haha .","294905":"there s a mexican food restaurant that i love going to because their food is always delicious . you can create your own burritos , tacos , and burrito bowls , and they also have churros and quesadillas . i normally get a burrito bowl with white rice , pinto beans , carnitas , guacamole , salsa , cheese , and lettuce . it s one of the best meals ever .","294906":"i don t really enjoy swimming in general . but i like being near the ocean , and sometimes i ll wade out into shallow waters and dig my toes in the soft sand . it makes me feel closer to nature .","294907":"i ve always wanted to travel to australia , new zealand , england , and spain .","294908":"nah , it s obviously much easier to spew bullsh t onto other people s pages , even though it s perhaps the easiest way to make a fool out of themselves , haha .","294909":"i ve always found that amusing too , especially with you in particular . occasionally i ll get an anon or two who tries super hard to bring you down on my page , knowing full well we re good friends . like . . . ? ? it goes against all common sense , lol .","294910":"yeah , there are a few shows i binge watch from time to time . they re usually some sort of true crime docu series . right now , i m watching the second season of the confession tapes on netflix .","294911":"it s interesting how this anon is so dead set on calling you scared or ashamed when they re the one who s anonymous , lmaoo .","294912":"my boyfriend does on occasion , yeah . it isn t really an unusual thing for couples to do . lmao , which reminds me of a funny story . when i was at my cousin s wedding on saturday , my boyfriend noticed that my cousin grabbed his wife s ass when they were standing on front of the church before pictures were being taken , lmaoo .","294913":"these messages are hella silly and immature . if you have such an issue with littlesha , then express these feelings on her page . they mean nothing to me , so i m not responding to them from here on out .","294914":"i think i want to try things like bungee jumping , sky diving , parasailing , and ziplining . however , i m absolutely terrified of these things at the same time , lol .","294915":"sleeping sickness by city colour https www . youtube . com watch ? v ru wpvclmq","294916":"i ve become a simple souvenir of someone s kill . and like the sea , i m constantly changing from calm to ill . madness fills my heart and soul as if the great divide could swallow me whole . oh , how i m breaking down .","294917":"i grab my boyfriend s ass all the time , lmao .","294918":"hello i m not up to much at the moment . i m just relaxing by listening to soothing music , drinking iced coffee , and catching up on what i missed on social media today .","294919":"i m in a relationship .","294920":"no , i m perfectly content with the amount of friends i have at the moment . i see three friends occasionally , as well as my boyfriend , and that s enough to keep me busy .","294921":"apparently some anons like to pull sh t out of their ass in order to fabricate drama .","294922":"fine , as far as i m aware . my physical health is perfectly fine , as usual , and my mental health has been much better this past week compared to last week . i ve been trying to put myself on a stricter general schedule routine so that my moods can be more even waking up at the same time every day , taking my meds at the same time every day , eating at the same time every day , and exercising every two days .","294923":"why are you asking me this question , when you should really be asking littlesha ? ? lmaoo . i m not on askfm until at least pm , and sometimes early in the mornig before am if i have spare time before work . i don t know the majority of what is said on my feed .","294924":"i m feeling fine i m still a bit tired from the weekend , but that s to be expected , especially considering i didn t get enough sleep last night and woke up twice throughout the night for no apparent reason . right now , i m drinking some iced coffee and catching up on my questions here and also listening to music . i really need to wash my hair , but i don t have the energy right now .","294925":"if the topic hurts you too much to write about it , then perhaps you aren t ready to write about that topic yet . you may still need to do some thinking and soul searching to come to terms with that topic , or at least begin to accept that whatever happened has happened and you have to try to move forward from it . the words will come in time . sometimes , it helps the healing process . but if you can t muster the words right now , don t force yourself .","294926":"? ? ? i ve never said i was poor people have always asked if i was wealthy , and obviously that isn t the case so i always say no . there s a difference between being poor and being in that weird in between stage where you re not poor , but you re not well off either .","294927":"consent for you and even a potential boyfriend getting filmed , photographed , and gushed over and if i m honest , it was mostly straight girls . i identify as mostly straight now , but was mostly gay in my teen and early s , and i lived through all that thinking the fetishization was normal . yeah , i remember that too honestly , i wrote gay fanfiction too when i was a teenager , lol . thankfully that didn t transpose into my real life , it was just a way for me to practice my writing . however , i definitely understand where you re coming from . thank you for providing this perspective","294928":"summer just started , so i really don t have one yet .","294929":"yeah , my boyfriend s family got a groupon deal so it isn t very expensive at all . plus i ve been paying it off in monthly installments .","294930":"i m going to the caribbean next winter .","294931":"my next objective for the month of july is to get my passport .","294932":"i m always up for an adventure . it seldom happens , though . i don t have a group of friends i rarely see my few friends to begin with due to conflicting schedules .","294933":"i don t normally eat late night snacks . i usually have dinner and then i m done eating for the night .","294934":"all of my lessons , i ve learned the hard way , haha . i was never one to really listen to authority when it comes to advice about situations , i always had to experience it myself .","294935":"yes , i see no problem with that . not everyone is equipped to handle mental illness , but as long as they at least tried to understand and didn t discriminate against them for having mental illness , then there s nothing inherently wrong with breaking up with a person because they really cannot handle it .","294936":"i made a salad , if that counts . lmao .","294937":"i only follow people whose answers i like , and i find it distasteful when people demand that i follow them simply because they chose to follow me first .","294938":"no , not that i can recall .","294939":"abandonment","294940":"i actually believe that gay men and lesbians are treated similarly because lesbians are fetishized . take , for example , the lesbian couple who were assaulted because they wouldn t kiss on demand when a stranger asked them to . lesbians are likely in just as dangerous positions as gay men .","294941":"lol , no . not at all . there s no age limit to using askfm or any social media site in general .","294942":"why did you send this to several people ? lmao . no , i don t hate buses .","294943":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","294944":"i just got to work .","294945":"i usually go to bed anywhere between pm and am . i wake up at am every morning .","294946":"aw , thank you so much ! !","294947":"aw , no problem ! !","294948":"like i said , i m not comfortable talking about my childhood .","294949":"i don t feel comfortable talking about my childhood , sorry .","294950":"time outs , taking electronics or whatever they express interest in away , grounding for a week , etc etc . keep in mind i know absolutely nothing about children , lmao .","294951":"no . i believe there are some risks for people to have children after they reach , but modern medicine has progressed to such a point where its easier to manage those types of pregnancies .","294952":"it isn t really something i can give suggestions about because it s different for everyone . people learn over time what works and doesn t work for them , and in order to be true to yourself and express yourself comfortably , you have to learn about yourself over the course of many years . it doesn t happen overnight .","294953":"it doesn t represent or affect me , lol . i just like changing my hair color often because i get tired of the same colors all the time . i ve been coloring my hair since i was years old .","294954":"i went to the salon and got it done .","294955":"haha , no . that would totally ruin the moment .","294956":"no . i don t think anyone s face is symmetrical .","294957":"i really enjoy sushi the most . it s pretty versatile and i absolutely cannot get enough of it , haha . i also tried pad thai for the first time two weeks ago fell in love .","294958":"no , quite the opposite , lol . i don t really care what other people think about my opinions , and i ve always been pretty outspoken about my perspectives when asked .","294959":"only from my friends . i usually feel uncomfortable if strangers compliment me .","294960":"yes , definitely . it s a problem when people feel attacked because they refuse to take accountability for their own actions .","294961":"the only thing that bothers me is that he s a very messy person , lol . he throws his clothes wherever , he leaves empty cups on the table , the garbage doesn t usually make it to the garbage , etc etc . it used to be much worse , so it s gotten better within the past year ever since he reorganized his bedroom . he has more incentive to keep it clean and has learned that he feels better mentally when his living space is organized .","294962":"usually because they re insecure with themselves or have pent up aggression from experiences normally at home . people don t bully others unless they feel weak in some aspect of their lives , or unfulfilled . it never comes from a good place .","294963":"yes , i was bullied a lot when i was in middle school , as well as the beginning of high school . i was bullied for my appearance and my dress style , because i was goth at the time .","294964":"an experience i had at work this afternoon . on my lunch break , my coworkers and i were outside and noticed a dog running around the parking lot it seemed scared . my coworkers cautiously walked to the parking lot to see what was going on , and after about minutes , a woman walked out of the office building and basically said , oh yeah , that s my dog . did she escape ? and totally didn t seem phased by the fact that her dog was running around and almost got lost . also , the dog didn t have a collar or identification . the woman left the dog in the car for who knows how long , with the window wide open . the dog likely hopped out of the car because it was dying of heat . i was so annoyed and upset over the entire ordeal , the woman was totally irresponsible . she shouldn t have a dog to begin with if she can t take care of it .","294965":"heathers the crow sweeney todd queen of the damned american psycho","294966":"i would probably start laughing , but also be annoyed slightly at the same time , lmao . i wouldn t take my annoyance seriously though because it is a lighthearted joke , but i definitely would be like , what the f ck ? ! you re an a shole ! haha .","294967":"a resume is a basic overview of your professional experiences and goals , and it can be as simple or as complex as you d like . personally speaking , i ve always gone with a more simple , straightforward approach with my resumes for easy reading . i ll list my career objectives , my past work history with a brief explanation of my tasks and responsibilities , and my schooling with certain achievements , like being on the dean s list or graduating magna cum laude or being published . i also have a section on my resume of my professional skills , i . e . proficiency in adobe , microsoft office , photo editing , customer service , writing and editing , etc etc . at the end of the resume , i have a section that says references available upon request , and on a separate document i have a few professional references with their email addresses and whatnot . if you need any tips , feel free to ask ! !","294968":"on rare occasions , yes . i mostly drive everywhere i need to go , but sometimes i ll have to take an uber somewhere . i also take the train if i ever go into new york city .","294969":"haha , yeah . i dislike my next door neighbor . he s a really irritable old man who complains about everything , mows his lawn at am on the weekends , and yells at my landscapers . he s extremely rude , and before his wife passed away , i could hear him screaming at her most nights when i would go outside to have a cigarette .","294970":"no , i don t have a swimming pool at my house . my family used to have a pool in the backyard , but it was extremely old . we eventually took it down perhaps years ago i don t remember .","294971":"i purchased beer at a gas station in upstate new york , so the attendant asked for my id . that was on friday night .","294972":"i am ! ! she doesn t have an askfm account , though .","294973":"no , i ve never eaten caviar before . i never had a desire to try it .","294974":"yes ! ! i try to put on a face mask at least once a week no more than twice per week , though . i find that the charcoal face masks help clear up my skin and keep it feeling clean .","294975":"my cell phone , my television , the game of thrones anthology , a piece of jewelry , and a pack of cigarettes .","294976":"there s nothing inherently wrong with being a social justice warrior in the sense that there isn t anything wrong with being socially conscious , advocating for the rights of others , and calling out problematic behavior to be more inclusive . however , there s this sjw culture of people who claim to be feminists , but they use it to their advantage to try to justify their own problematic beliefs . it s more of a popularity label than anything else , and people generally don t advocate for what s morally and socially right anymore . it s just an arguing competition online , and in general these people don t transpose their words into actions irl .","294977":"when i dance , i look like a fish flopping on the ground after being reeled in from the water . lmao . me dancing is definitely not a pretty sight , so i avoid it at all costs .","294978":"i find a sense of confidence to be attractive however , not too confident to the point where they re arrogant about themselves . it s beautiful to see a person embracing themselves and being true to themselves and express those feelings without shame . i also find dark senses of humor to be attractive , lol . as well as having an open mind , maturity , being down to earth , and having a bold and unpredictable personality .","294979":"my experience with askfm has mostly been positive ! ! i ve met tons of amazing , wonderful people on here some of whom i can call a genuine friend .","294980":"uh , no ? lmao . it s common courtesy to use a person s correct pronouns , but it shouldn t be treated as if it s some criminal act if someone doesn t use right pronouns . it s definitely rude af , but not illegal .","294981":"i ve never purchased flowers for anyone , but i ve received flowers on a few occasions . a few years ago , my boyfriend sent a big bouquet of flowers to my office for valentine s day . it came with chocolate too , haha . it was one of the cutest things he has ever done for me .","294982":"if you re going through hell , keep going . it inspires me to keep pushing through even when i m struggling . sometimes you may feel as if you ve hit rock bottom , but that only means the only way you can go is up . if things feel as if they cannot get any worse , then the only thing that can happen is that they ll get better .","294983":"i normally eat healthy , but i do sometimes have junk food every now and again in moderation . usually in the form of small servings of cheetos or cheez its , lol .","294984":"i d rather attend a bbq . there s nothing better than grilling some burgers and hot dogs in the middle of the summer , drinking a beer , and having a campfire .","294985":"i don t personally know . i don t know the salary ranges for file clerks or paralegals .","294986":"bad days by ajr https www . youtube . com watch ? v m ldh m c g","294987":"my best friend irl is a woman i met when we were both just years old ! ! we ve been best friends for years . i don t really have an askfm bestie , but i m probably the closest to littlesha and misphire .","294988":"oh yeah , all the time . i normally delete all of those messages . they re not worth responding to .","294989":"unfortunately , yes . that s why i have most of my accounts on private and don t generally talk to strangers online .","294990":"bloody mary scared me a lot , haha . i never actually did it because i was terrified that it was real .","294991":"cool ranch doritos are yummy .","294992":"my beliefs align with intersectional feminism but i don t identify with the label of feminist .","294993":"i like carrots . i d rather have them raw because then i can dip them in hummus , haha .","294994":"definitely a glass of water . milk is disgusting .","294995":"wedding selfie","294996":"yes , i ve struggled with depression since i was years old .","294997":"i was at work when you sent this to me . now i m home making a cup of coffee .","294998":"i never wanted to please her , but whatever helps you sleep at night . i know my opinions and intentions , and you re definitely far off the mark , lol .","294999":"uh , no ? why would it get weird ? lmao .","295000":"i normally just drink beer or wine . my favorite beer is fat tire and my favorite wine is pindar .","295001":"yeah , new york is fairly expensive pretty much just the island and the city .","295002":"yeah , i do both of those things .","295003":"aw , thank you so much ! !","295004":"i still think it s gross , but it really isn t my concern what other people do in their relationships . what would this even have to do with cadence , anyway ? she doesn t even use askfm , lmao .","295005":"honestly , normally my anxiety keeps me awake at night because my mind sometimes races a mile a minute and i can t control it . once i m asleep then i m fine i maybe wake up only once or twice a night , but getting to sleep can be difficult at times .","295006":"my stamina is absolutely terrible , but it s gotten a lot better ever since i started working out .","295007":"whoops , i didn t see this until today monday , lol . on friday , my boyfriend and i drove five hours upstate and then had dinner at a smokehouse bbq restaurant . then we went back to the hotel room , got high , and went to bed .","295008":"i don t personally know . i m not up to date on politics now as i used to be in the past , and i don t really have a strong opinion on the issue in general .","295009":"as a whole , no . i m not an inherently happy person because i ve struggled with depression my entire life . i certainly have a few happy moments and i give off the impression that i m fine , but most of the time , i m in a neutral mood .","295010":"yeah , of course . there s nothing inherently wrong with being a conservative as long as you don t hide behind your beliefs to try to justify problematic or oppressive perspectives i . e . being racist , sexist , or homophobic , etc etc .","295011":"i have work from am to pm . then i plan on either making dinner with my mother or ordering in , showering , and relaxing in front of my television before going to bed .","295012":"i almost cried at the wedding on saturday , lol . it was so beautiful and moving . but other than that , i think the last time i cried was sometime early last week . i was having a really bad mental health day .","295013":"no , i don t particularly care to look at your profile to see what you look like .","295014":"i basically just answered this in my first answer , lol . i don t find it attractive in my own relationship , but it doesn t concern me if other people use it in their relationships .","295015":"thank you , and yes i agree . masculinity in itself isn t toxic and there s no issue with embracing your masculine or feminine features . it s when you begin exhibiting traits of toxic behavior or thought patterns where it becomes an issue , and that s largely due to society s general expectations of men .","295016":"depending on how long they are , yeah . this trip was five hours long each way , so my boyfriend and i grabbed some waters and coffee before the trip , as well as some quick snacks .","295017":"yiruma s river flows in you was played at the wedding this weekend i almost started crying . https youtu . be majoi qmu","295018":"i ve never listened to it before .","295019":"everyone report this account , please ! ! that s absolutely disgusting , i can t believe people like this exist .","295020":"no , i don t personally believe so . there are a significant number of people who shave their arm hair . i would do it myself if i wasn t concerned of it growing back in darker .","295021":"i believe i was or years old when i received my first cell phone . back then , we didn t have smartphones so the only things i was able to do was text and make phone calls .","295022":"yes , i ve eaten lobster before . it s delicious to me , but i only have it on very rare occasions . most of the time , it s in lobster bisque soup .","295023":"haha , no . i don t even know how to ride a regular bicycle .","295024":"my favorite condiment is ranch . my least favorite condiment is mustard and mayonnaise .","295025":"i don t believe it s possible to fall in love with someone you literally just met , no . however , even online relationships can ignite feelings of love between two people . just because it s online doesn t mean it s less real or your feelings aren t valid .","295026":"my first kiss was with my first girlfriend when we were years old .","295027":"i sorta took the latin words for poetry and moon mashed them together , haha . i wanted something latin based that resembled something that represented me , and i thought it was fitting .","295028":"it isn t too expensive right now , and i ve definitely seen it worse . the cheapest right now has been . gallon .","295029":"no , they didn t have wedding vows . it was a traditional romanian ceremony , so it was much different than a regular catholic wedding . they still had the exchanging of the rings in the very beginning , but the rest of the wedding was in a byzantine tradition .","295030":"probably ! ! i think personalized wedding vows are beautiful , and i ve actually never been to a wedding where the couple wrote their own vows .","295031":"no , i ve never traveled anywhere by myself . every time i ve taken a trip , it s been with my boyfriend or a close friend .","295032":"yes , i am indeed aware that there is a high divorce rate in the united states . that isn t necessarily a bad thing , though . these days , people are more apt to recognize when a relationship isn t working anymore and they re willing to break up in order to further both of their senses of happinesses , not only for themselves but for the children as well .","295033":"it s a celebration of the love that exists between two people . obviously there are legal benefits to being married as well , but i ve also always been somewhat of a romantic and believe that weddings are beautiful traditions .","295034":"yeah , i m sure my boyfriend and i will eventually get married in the future . we re in absolutely no rush either way , it isn t a priority to us .","295035":"one of my cousins ! ! he and his bride were absolutely stunning . i posted a picture a few posts below , but they might have gotten buried .","295036":"i ve wanted tattoos for as long as i could remember . i got my first tattoo the week after my th birthday .","295037":"my trip was good ! ! my boyfriend and i headed upstate friday morning and checked into the hotel . we had dinner at a smokehouse bbq place and then went back to the hotel to sleep since we were both exhausted from the drive . saturday , we went to the church ceremony for the wedding and then the reception afterwards . the reception was at this big , beautiful barn in the mountains of the adirondacks , and it was absolutely gorgeous . we stayed until about pm and then left because we were both feeling toasted , lol . today , we left the hotel super early to drive home , which took about five hours . i dropped him off at his house and then went home , and i napped for a little while . overall , the trip was wonderful and well worth the very long drive .","295038":"i enjoy my current job a lot . right now , i m working as a writer and editor for a publishing company , and they ve been extremely accommodating over the past . years . i feel at home in the office with my coworkers , and everyone is extremely friendly . my dream job , however , is a stay at home novelist .","295039":"hello do you have a question ? ?","295040":"i don t like receiving questions pertaining to my family . honestly , i normally just delete them .","295041":"i like personalized questions pertaining to my life , my relationship , my hobbies , my job or education , my friendships , etc etc . i even like the occasional how are you ? or how was your day ? types of questions because i think it s interesting to have that sort of insight into someone s life .","295042":"i don t answer inappropriate questions , questions that are obviously trolling , or anything that s s xual in nature .","295043":"i like dipping french fries into vanilla ice cream like if i go to mcdonalds , i ll get a small french fry and dip them in an oreo mcflurry . i also sometimes put potato chips on my cheeseburgers or hot dogs .","295044":"i would get the tattoo that i ve been planning on getting for about a year now , haha . it s a writing quill in black , white and gray ink .","295045":"i don t have any pets . however , here s a picture of the bride and groom dancing from saturday night .","295046":"my boyfriend and i don t really go on stereotypical dates very often since we don t get to see each other as frequently as we d like to . i believe the last time we went on a date was perhaps over a month ago we went to texas roadhouse for dinner and drinks one night .","295047":"i m neither happy nor sad . i m fairly neutral , probably because of how tired i am . i just want to lay in a bed of blankets in silence for the rest of the night .","295048":"no , quite the opposite actually . if a man cries , he s simply human it s normal , expected and healthy to cry for a variety of emotions someone isn t less of a man for releasing those emotions . the idea that crying makes men weak is extremely unhealthy and antiquated . it s a stigma used against men to promote toxic hypermasculinity in a society where men are conditioned into thinking that they should never display emotion . it s not good or healthy to suppress yourself like that , regardless of your gender .","295049":"no , i have no desire to see toy story .","295050":"sure , i probably could be classified as a nerd . i m a big ole book reading , video game playing , glasses wearing , philosophical question asking sort of person .","295051":"i know plenty of people who call their partners daddy . it s fairly common these days it doesn t personally bother me . i wouldn t use it in my own relationship , but other people s relationships don t concern me .","295052":"i already explained this in more detail below , but in short , my boyfriend and i traveled home from upstate new york this morning afternoon . i ve been laying down pretty much ever since i got home because the drive exhausted me . anyway here s a picture of the bride and groom walking to have their first dance .","295053":"i have snapchat , but i don t give out my username to people i don t personally know .","295054":"hello do you have a question ? ?","295055":"i usually sleep for anywhere between and hours . it really depends on the night .","295056":"i normally don t wake up any later than am , even on my days off from work .","295057":"i normally hit snooze once at the very most , otherwise i know i ll be late for work . i like getting to work at least minutes early so that i don t have to rush .","295058":"i haven t been in any sort of schooling for six years , haha . i graduated college in .","295059":"you can see our outfits pretty well in this picture . my dress was all maroon floral with beige wedges , and he wore a gray suit with blue accents and brown shoes .","295060":"when you asked me this , i was getting ready to leave for the trip . i logged off of askfm from friday morning until this afternoon , so i apologize that i didn t get to see this message in time .","295061":"haha , thank you ! ! i had a fine day my boyfriend and i woke up in the hotel , got on the road by am , and got home around pm . we picked up some lunch on the way home because we were starving , and after i dropped him off at his house , i came home , sorted through my things , and laid down for an hour or two . i m still exhausted , so i m probably going to call it an early night . i kinda regret not taking off from work tomorrow .","295062":"aw , don t be jealous . there s no need for that . i m sure you re a beautiful person too .","295063":"lol . in due time , my friend .","295064":"just my cell phone . i have a samsung galaxy s .","295065":"i did ! ! thank you so much .","295066":"i didn t drive , my boyfriend drove bless his heart . the trip itself was fine , just getting through new york city was terrible both going there and coming home . it was a five hour ride both ways .","295067":"partly , yes . i didn t want to go to the wedding with my hair as faded and terrible looking as it was , and i also wanted to color it again anyway . so it just worked out .","295068":"i love weddings too , they re so festive and full of hope and joy . i don t have the opportunity to go to weddings often , i ve only been to four in my entire life .","295069":"no , the italian is my side of the family . the bride s family is romanian .","295070":"not at all , i m so happy for my cousin . i didn t have any negative feelings whatsoever . they re a gorgeous couple .","295071":"i ll post more pictures later . i wore a maroon floral dress . the wedding was fun because of the location and the general atmosphere of the place and the people invited . it was a full out party , haha . you had italians and romanians . everyone got along really well .","295072":"burlap beams wedding barn in upstate new york ! !","295073":"hello , friends ! ! i m
