Not in a global way per say, but used daily with Gods guidance & protection.\n  ","341586":"\n  I've seen people do it. I've never experienced this phenomenon. As a \"traditional aries woman\" (loosely used), I'm all or nothing. If I love honestly, I don't put eggs in another basket or gave a side situation in my heart. But I understand a person could fall in love with certain aspects of a more than one person & feel deep feelings for 2 people. However, for me...everything is connected. So it's hard for me to remove someone from my head & focus on the person in front of me.

NY has started a program for people who live in NYC for a few yrs with a certain GPA that will give high achieving students free education at NY state schools.

I wasnt able to let my wall down so I was often protective & sensitive instead of trusting & loving. We had waaaay diff love languages.\n  \n  Then came my 1st adult love at age 18. His smile & warmth shifted something in my spirit. I just wanted to be in his presence all the time. But I was young & had an undeveloped mind when it came to relationships. I didnt voice my needs becoz I expected him to know them, when I didnt know what they were. So I acquiesced to a lot & hid inside myself without even being asked to & stayed extra busy while trying to figure out who I was becoming. We were best friends, yet became strangers in the same bed.\n  ","341594":"\n  True friendship means sometimes wanting the best for others when it may not be the best for you.

Way too many people are worried about what others think. When it's all said and done, no one can live your life for you. If you're not honest & happy, you're not fully living.

The job market is \u00fcber competitive. BUT some sectors are booming like occupational therapy, nursing, pharmacy technicians, X-Ray tech, dental asst., etc. Look for county\/community colleges that offer good programs at low cost & change or start a new career if you must. Invest in yourself. Save $ and get certified in a field that is hiring now.\n  ","341604":"\n  An irresistible candy. Melt in your mouth good. A best of both worlds kinda treat.

The mother who sacrificed her happiness to raise children pouring herself into them. The father who works under conditions that test his dignity to provide for his family until opportunity knocks. The pioneers at work, careers & neighborhoods who break color lines. The folks who don't give into temptation just becoz it's easy. The selfless, inspirational, wise & funny folks. Personal: My mom who grew up very poor in a very small town in the segregated south who instead of hate & fear, operates in love & treats people as God's children...until u cross that Gemini. Then all bets are off. Ice Cold. Ha!\n  ","341608":"\n  I'll never forget anyone I've ever loved. Although my 8th-10th grade boyfriend would mos def tell u I was insecure & we put thru the ringer with sarcasm & innuendo,  instead of strait talk. He knew how to love me tho. Bless his heart. And my 12 yr high school sweetheart relationship had to endure all of my growth that I kept hidden. I never gave him what he needed. I acquiesced to be what everyone in my life thought I should be. I didnt know how to love myself or him & ignored all my intuition for comfort\/sanity. And I didnt consider marriage. I knew we weren't matched the way a permanent thriving couple should be. We were too immature to give what the other needed. Blinders on. Different outlooks on life. Poor guys. O & D thanks for pushing me to grow eventhough it wasnt on purpose. I'm not enemies with any exes. No matter what men have put me thru & vice versa. I'll never hate them\/ya'll. But what's in the past is in the past for a reason. I'm not the same person. I'm fully me.\n  ","341609":"\n  Yes & No. I had a professor who was also the newspaper editor, my advisor & dean of school. She hated my beauty, entertainment & self help style of writing. I was really into Honey Mag at the time. She was a devout feminist. She found it fluffy & lacking substance. I wrote for the college paper only when she was on hiatus. Instead of proving her wrong, I did internships in TV, then Movie Studio, and ultimately music. I left my love of writing behind, except for gov't writing & a few published human services pieces. I blog & blogged for forharriet.com for a while (inconsistently). Yeats later, I now have a writing\/consultation company. The journey was long & hard. I had to accept who I was & embrace my gifts. I let 1 person in various capacities delay me. Hindsight: God's timing.\n  ","341610":"\n  2nd Quarter I'm focusing on two things. 1. Coaching Newbies: I'll have some session specials. 2. Outings. If ur in the area I'm hosting a quite a few girlfriend outings to develop or foster Sisterhood. Fourth 1\/4 we'll have a healing event (Ladies Only).\n  ","341611":"\n  No. I think what can be habitual is the things we do to show people that we love them. Learn their love language & spice it up a bit. However, I do think if a relationship doesn't grow with the people things can become stagnant & love wanes from the strain of lack of honesty & communication. Also, Finances, Emotional stress along with lies can ruin love if you don't decide to love daily. Love is a choice. We choose to give ourselves to others & connect with purpose & compromise.\n  ","341612":"\n  Life lessons. Circumstances. The irony of things, if you remove yourself from a situation & look at it as a complete stranger...can be pure comedy.\n  \n  Also, Gourmet Ice Cream is funny and sad. I'll go all the way to NYC for something that takes minutes to eat before it melts. Ha! I'm full of jokes today.\n  ","341613":"\n  Does a fish love water?!!!!! (Slice Keeper photo included). I've had & loved Port Authority NYC area cheap pizza to Nino's Deep Dish in Chicago. My faves as the older adult that I am has more texture & veggies becoz I no longer eat meat (for now). Some local faves were cajun chicken or garlic shrimp from Crispy Crust on Palisade Ave Eng. I grew up on decadent cheesy Have-A-Pizza (foster village, bergenfield) no longer exists. No I just do Blaze Pizza & create my own thin crust. My future husband needs to be ready for a Paris trip for pizza. No lie.\n  ","341614":"\n  My favorite candy is gourmet\/imported dark chocolate. However, I would eat GODIVA Milk Chocolate covered strawberries for lunch or dinner during shopping mall trips instead of food court food when I was in high school & college. Blame it on my dear friend Elisita\/Erinezer (Erin Stripling) it was 1 of her high school jobs & she ruined me for life. Even in college I kept up the practice. Additionally, I love Reece's cups, Kit Kats, &Welch's Gummies.\n  ","341615":"\n  Thousands I cashed out after layoffs from my 457B (deferred comp\n  \n  like 401K, but for gov't jobs). I used it to live & pay bills when I was laid off yrs ago. It was a good chunk.\n  ","341616":"\n  I'm most sad when someone I trust or love has disappointed me thru deception or lies. The first Aries in me wants to be heard so love to reiterate or re-explain to be understood (some would say to prove im right) - working on that, but at the end of the day it doesn't always bring understanding, so... BUT I deplore raised voices\/fights. Never want that in my household.\n  ","341617":"\n  I'm a sucker for all things 80's movies\/music.\n  \n  I digress.\n  \n  1. Superhero\/Fantasy movies are my escape from reality.\n  \n  2. Action Movies for the cars & hot bods.\n  \n  3. Dramatic Comedy \/ Chic Flicks. (I swear I was Dara (mtv) in high school.\n  \n  4.

I fangirled Michael Jordan dang near my whole life until I learned of his political\/social views & actions.\n  \n  Muhammad Ali I visited in training camp as a youngster. I owned a Dr. J doll which I used as a Ken doll. Love him!\n  \n  HOWEVER I'm a Lebronsexual. I adore him on & off the court. Serena Wiliams is a beast. I love her like I loved Flo Jo (Florence Griffith Joyner).\n  ","341619":"\n  I enjoy the fresh smell of citrus. Right now the incense I have are coconut mango. For sleep a good spritz of lavendar on my pillow. Cologne on men...it varies. I was obsessed with Issay Miyake cologne in college. Blame it in my 1st boyfriend from 8th grade lol.\n  ","341620":"\n  Yes. Yes I have. It's pretty common to think about escaping a situation when you feel overwhelmed with reality. That's why it's important to have people in your life to contact to give you a picture of the future.\n  ","341621":"\n  If I'm melancholy I listen to Daniel Caesar. I feel love at it's pure form listening to him pour out his heart. He hits me like early Musiqsoulchild. I can zone out in a cocoon of love flaws & all. It's like a fairytale.\n  ","341622":"\n  Whooooo! Trust is a strong word. Honestly, I trust my aces. They've stood the test of time, nurturing, keeping secrets & accepting me fully. Quirks & all. To them (my chosen family), I give my devotion.\n  ","341623":"\n  Haven't taken a picture of myself in weeks. Except for the snap I posted here. Not a fan of my pics. Latest photo in my gallery is from yesterday. Here it is.\n  ","341624":"\n  Are you referring to today? Finally done moving into a new house. Sometimes the overwhelming feeling of love & appreciation hits me. Especially after a transition or obstacle. I am so grateful to be surrounded by a loving network of folks...who are my chosen family.\n  ","341625":"\n  Although religiously I do not believe in past lives, I do believe in unexplained connection & experiences. I cannot explain d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or the feeling of home that presents itself with certain people at certain moments. We all come from the same source. Sometimes we feel each others souls or a moment (i.e. at the ocean) as if it were the only thing in the galaxy.\n  ","341626":"\n  Hey there. I believe this question I answered a while back, might be the answer you're looking for. If not, feel free to clarify. (See attached photo).\n  ","341627":"\n  Ha ha ha. 1. I don't like pictures of myself. The curves become the focal point. I only smile and show dimples & teeth if others are in the photo with me becoz I got tired of people complaining as a teen. 2. I only post captures of moments\/feelings or events. Semi Answer: I love my skin tanned, so I guess summer bronzing pics are my fave type. 2nd fave type me in heels. Bonus: Here's a snap of me at this moment.\n  ","341628":"\n  Real heroes are the every day people who take time to connect with others thru help, smiles\/hugs (at the perfect moment), listening w\/ out judgement or sharing resources no matter how small. It's those lasting examples of selflessness that I remember most. I just posted on my personal FB pg about 1 of my heroes who recently passed. She saw deep within me & offered tough love.\n  ","341629":"\n  I actually use pumpkin spice on top of my fall foods like apple pies, sweet potato pie b4 I add whipped cream or almond milk whipped cream or even on sweet potatoes. It's cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves & allspice. However, fall season is over. Spring is fresh fruit season. Yum!\n  ","341630":"\n  I love to attend concerts (even intimate venues), visit exhibits, reading & writing, trying out unique restaurants, night walking w\/ skyline views & watching  ASMR videos that give me tingles or relaxation on YouTube.\n  ","341631":"\n  Hi there. See picture. I answered this a few days ago.\n  ","341632":"\n  Confidence is fly. Cockiness is usually a repellant for me. Being mixy just to be mixy or dying to be seen...isn't my scene. However, interactive folks make a party! They are the people others gravitate to. A balance of talkers & listeners, doers & watchers makes it exciting! Too many acquaintances isn't my issue. It's the folks who give close friend access to acquaintances & wonder why they're always getting dissapointed.\n  ","341633":"\n  Hey Babygirl,\n  \n  Trust your intuition. Love yourself as much as you love humanity. Life will throw you curve balls...connevt anyway.\n  \n  You have unique spiritual gifts, stop denying your uniqueness.

I also love to laugh. Bonus points for witty\/funny (3) guys. And a good stride\/walk (4)...yum confident presence is sexy!\n  ","341648":"\n  It's in everyday interaction. I can honestly say I feel like a World -Changer, when I make a touch, look, words, moments count. I want people to feel me & I want to feel something from them. BUT I'm cognizant that I choose when to open up. Work in Progress.\n  ","341649":"\n  The most important thing I do every day is breathe. Feeling alive doesn't always feel good. Sometimes there's pain, sometimes pleasure. I welcome the lessons. I'm working on being more present. After a hard days work I sit in silence for s few minutes and essentially \"take my coat off\" & let the day wash away. Spiritually I need to connect with others when I get home in loving & positive ways.\n  ","341650":"\n  It depends on how u look at it. The short answer is deteriorating. Humans need each other and the connection that exists across lines. We lose a bit of ourselves with too much division yet we don't gain much being separatists.

It freed me from unnecessary illness, stress & pain. It doesn't mean I don't care if I say no...it means I care about my wellbeing.\n  ","341655":"\n  I can be downright silly. I love to laugh! I release my innermost emotions writing & other artsy creative pathways. I don't believe in arguing...but the Aries in me wants my words to be understood. I used to walk away to avoid hurting others with my words. I swallowed my words. Now I believe it is equally painful to NOT express one's feelings. I have a disdain for raised angry voices. No time for that in my household.\n  ","341656":"\n  I like gifts that involve doing something with the person who gifted it, like a class, museum, trip, spa treatment, or something special that shows they've paid attn to the things I like.
