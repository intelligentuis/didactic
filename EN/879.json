Bc if I were to run the distances they did, would it still feel like I was just running normally, or would I actually barely even realize it bc I'm going so fast that I can hardly see\/tell?\n  \n  I guess for example, if I were to run home from work one day bc I forgot my work vest, would I be running like how I normally run but just not losing as much breath or tiredness, feeling the same as I normally would but everyone would be \"frozen\" around me so by the time I got back time hardly passed, or would I feel faster and feel like I'm running in the time that everyone sees me as (a blur\/streak) and just somehow be able to take things in faster (like stuff I read and my whereabouts, etc....)?\n  \n  Bc if it's the former, I think I would use it a lot less just bc shit would take a long time for me, even if it was only really like 2 seconds in real time and it was fast for everyone else... But if it's the latter, then my answer stays the same.\n  \n  This is smth I've never understood bc when The Flash does important shit really fast, then the show slows down everyone else so we see Barry moving around and thinking in our time as if things aren't going on really fast for him, it just seems that way for everyone else... but then they show clips of him doing small things like reading a book or running to work and they just show it as a \"streak\" as if it takes no time at all (as it does).

I do know that racism, by definition, can only exist when one group has power and influence over another. Therefore, the ones racist to Asians\/Latinos are white people. many white people I imagine (ofc not all) are finding it easier to just \"ride the wave\" instead of actually showing care for the situations. they may post smth when smth becomes big on the news (for ex, George Floyd), but they don't care if it's not on the news and they just post bc everyone else is doing it. After the news dies down (which sadly, it always does way too soon), they no longer care. There is not quite as much Asian or Latino police brutality in US (which is the only country I can speak for) so they don't make it on the news like that. therefore, some messed up white people may find it more \"safe\" or \"appropriate\" to be racist towards Asians and\/or Latinos. they figure they won't get into as much trouble bc they aren't contributing to an as prevalent controversial issue in US. Anyway, that's just a spit ball theory. I don't really know and will never understand.\n  \n  And also, this can apply to discriminative Black or indigenous people as well. They just can't be \"racist.\" But they can be discriminative or mean. Everyone can be that by definition. I do believe on an overall scale, POCs tend to unite more than divide.

He focused too much on trying to send a message thru the movie that the plot didn't actually make much sense.

The director was trying to compete with the previous director so tried to make the movie nothing like the one before, and complained that the book was too long. Then he made stupid choices like lengthening the 1st tournament with the dragons which was horrible, revealing that Madeye wasn't Madeye right off the bat, making the France school all girls and the Hungarian one all boys, cutting out the Quidditch championship match, making Fleur (the only triward witch) a wimp in the maze, and letting like every single male in the cast have their hair long throughout the movie.\n  \n  - Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince - It just strayed from the original story so much, which wouldn't have been bad, if they hadn't just made it worse.\n  \n  - Captain America (the first one) - Had no character development.
