in you .","265785":"i believe the silent treatment makes things worse . when it comes to any relationship , whether it s romantic or platonic , communicating your feelings does wonders as opposed to

someone literally just told me that i looked years younger than my actual age , lmfaoo . my skin is smooth and i don t have wrinkles , so this is a very poor attempt at trolling .","265788":"depends

like a week after christmas , haha .","265790":"i believe community college is a great alternative in general , regardless of the pandemic or whatnot . there s nothing wrong with attending community college for two year programs , especially if a student is unsure of what they plan on studying . it provides them greater opportunities to delve deeper into their interests . gap years can be helpful too , particularly if the person finds a job and figures out whether or not that job s is worthy of their further study . everyone does education at their own pace .","265791":"no , not really . i can tolerate children , but i really don t know how to deal with a screaming child as an example if they re placed under my supervision , lol . i ve never had much experience with kids .","265792":"no , i

have the upper hand in this thread , but believe me when i say that a display photo is simply a photo of which i m proud nothing more , nothing less .","265794":"that isn t true it s because of the blm protests that increased awareness has been spread about the inequity and racial inequality that exists in america , and will further lead to greater legislation against police brutality .","265795":"have you not kept up with the events that happened in alone , not to mention years prior ? protesting has always been an integral part of history .","265796":"considering the intention of my photos aren t to be s xually appealing , i ll take this as a compliment . i ve never been one to attempt to be fawned over .","265797":"i understand the importance of protesting , so i m not going to sit here and say don t go to protests ever , especially in light of the events that happened in regarding trump and blm . however , wearing a mask during those protests is imperative and the least you can do to do your due diligence during these times .","265798":"apparently you didn t read the part where i said i never really looked into the conspiracy theory . educating someone about something for the sake of satisfying your thirst for drama is archaic . find something else to do with your spare time .","265799":"no , although i never looked into that conspiracy theory very much .","265800":"oh goodness , no . lol . i look much younger in photos than i do in real life , most likely .","265801":"not really , no . i ve done freelance contractor work online through my full time job on the weekends , but that s all .","265802":"definitely not . milk absolutely disgusts me .","265803":"people either think i m much younger or much older , lol .","265804":"i ve always been a relatively patient person when it comes to most people , so even when people are in front of me and exhibiting ignorance or even arrogance , it doesn t phase me . the most i can do is try to educate them , and if they re not willing to be educated , then that isn t my problem anymore .","265805":"i like more personalized questions , especially with respect to mental health , my hobbies , television shows or movies , my education or career , political beliefs , etc etc .","265806":"even though everyone has been pounding this concept into askfm s skull for ages now , the reporting blocking system needs desperate improvement .","265807":"i believe most people are fundamentally good , but of course there will always be a few bad apples thrown into the bunch as well .","265808":"no , although spiders do make me nervous , lol .","265809":"it isn t too difficult for me , personally . i can usually gauge what a person is interested in and go from there .","265810":"i have the tendency to be calm and collected externally , even when i m panicking on the inside . i ve always felt the need to be strong for other people , and situations often don t hit me until days after the fact .","265811":"veggie burrito bowls , lamb rice platters with white sauce , sushi , and pasta .","265812":"several of my friends had parents and other family members who d ed during the attacks because they all worked in manhattan . several of them who lived had to walk across the bridges on foot because everything was closed otherwise . schools were closed immediately , and in the following weeks months , several students weren t in class because they were too devastated from losing their family members . i recall one classmate literally having a breakdown in the middle of class and having to leave .","265813":"i took a few taekwondo classes when i was much younger , but that s all .","265814":"aw , thank you ! ! i wish the same for you my day was certainly productive , and i m in a relatively good mood . i m debating on playing video games with my friends tonight or watching supernatural .","265815":"i don t believe i ve been sick during the covid

the number of your followers remains the same not including followers who left askfm for one reason or another . the best way to receive more attention likes is to engage with the community more , i . e . asking the people you follow questions , sending shout outs , answering questions routinely with interesting answers , sending people follow up questions , etc etc . askfm also has different marketplace promos where you can promote your answers through paying for the service with coins , which i ve done on a few occasions .","265824":"angelina jolie , robert downey jr . , and jensen ackles .","265825":"the only mobile game i play is among us .","265826":"i sneeze when looking into sunlight .","265827":"yes , this happens to me on occasion . the glories of being a mentally

appreciate the offer , but i ve been in long term therapy for years and take multiple medications to treat my mental illnesses . talking to a random stranger online will not do anything .","265835":"you re not a medical professional , so no . your mere conversation will not help my mental health .","265836":"scrambled or over easy .","265837":"mental health , lol .","265838":"attend therapy .","265839":"best thing to happen to me this morning , lmaoo .","265840":"it wakes me up in the morning and allows me to focus on the tasks at hand .","265841":"it doesn t increase my anxiety , but it depends entirely on the individual . some people can t have coffee because it increases their anxiety .","265842":"tea , no . i normally have it straight . as for coffee , i use creamer .","265843":"nah , i don t watch anime .","265844":"i prefer iced coffee over hot coffee , but i m happy with both .","265845":"i m years old .","265846":"i sought professional treatment for mental health when i was years old , so between the ages of and .","265847":"i haven t sent any out this week yet , but i ve still been getting answers from shout outs that i sent weeks ago , sigh

.","265857":"as for netflix original series , probably you and the punisher .","265858":"eh , not really .","265859":"that s what sanctuaries are for they exist to help species thrive , and they re not zoos at all .","265860":"they re likely projecting their own insecurities on other people , because insulting someone can reflect how they genuinely feel about themselves .","265861":"no , considering my job depends entirely on technology in order to operate . i wouldn t really know what to do if technology didn t play a factor in my life .","265862":"i really have no idea , tbh . i try not to think about the distant future like that because life can change at a moment s notice .","265863":"how i handled the year , the four years of trump s presidency , and likely my experiences with the attacks .","265864":"yes , and it was devastating . i couldn t bear to look at the animals in the zoo because they looked so miserable , their enclosures were too small , and they looked like they weren t treated well at all .","265865":"yeah , i used to do independent studies into various topics all the time when i was younger , particularly when i was in college . i would be introduced to a concept that we would go over briefly in class , and so i would try to research more into the topic in depth on my own terms .","265866":"there s a long historical context behind the stigma of mental illness basically , people who were mentally ill were often seen as hysterical or deranged , and would be institutionalized for life instead of being treated as human beings . even though society has progressed a lot since those times , the stigma against mental illness exists to an extent especially in terms of more complex disorders , like trauma disorders , dissociation , personality disorders , etc etc . a lot of people refuse to see mental health as a legitimate issue , and they often see it as lesser than physical health problems because mental illness is an invisible illness . that s why we need to progress more in mental health awareness .","265867":"i m honestly not sure i d like to think that my friends see me as a reliable , creative person . as for my family , i ve unfortunately always been the outcast or black sheep of my family , especially in the year .","265868":"spanish , italian , russian , and latin .","265869":"gain deeper insight into my trauma ,

m sure those won t end anytime soon , lmaoo .","265910":"i m not fighting anyone s battles , lol . i m providing a small bit of education having discussions with others who ask me about the state of america . there s nothing wrong with having civil discussions . just because it doesn t personally affect you doesn t mean you can t talk about it .","265911":"never said i didn t experience privilege . i m just pointing out the inequities that exist in american society it doesn t mean it has anything to do with me .","265912":"it seems difficult , but it is possible . don t base your own recovery off of what i reveal about mine . it s always worth it to take that step forward to better yourself , and everyone is different . what hasn t worked for me may work well for you . healing isn t linear .","265913":"i m five feet tall .","265914":"people who live ordinary lives are affected by politics , whether they re conscious of it or not . although the wealthier makes the majority of the decisions and are in power , the consequences of those decisions ultimately fall on the working and lower classes . it s a backwards system , unfortunately . so yeah while some people have the privilege of sitting back enjoying a beer , other people s lives are at stake based on politics and the decisions made through local and federal government .","265915":"yep , generalized anxiety panic

is a bit weird , dude . obviously your previous account was banned for a reason . let it rest .","265924":"yes , this is definitely true . idk the other anon s medical history , but my mental illness history is quite extensive and complex which is why i ve been in long term cbt and now dbt therapy for several years , as well as take multiple medications . they shouldn t be discouraged because i

listening to music , and photography .","265940":"letterkenny ! ! my roommate has been showing me episodes of the show , and i think it s hilarious .","265941":"unstable , bad influence , and addictive .","265942":"yeah , it would be nice to not experience emotional pain anymore . i don t experience much physical pain at all , so that isn t a worry of mine , but i ve gone through so much turmoil and emotional pain that i don t know how much more of it i can handle .","265943":"certain things about my mental health that i had never considered before . . . or considered , but didn t pay any mind to it at all because i was too afraid of my subconscious being correct .","265944":"i have before , yes . there s no downside to applying for a job that you believe you re underqualified for the worst that can happen is that they simply don t contact you . it doesn t hurt to put your name out there .","265945":"my ex , without a doubt . we re on good terms and we re close friends , so that wouldn t be weird at all .","265946":"i opened a new bottle of wine that i never tried before , and it s so incredibly delicious .","265947":"yeah , for job applications and whatnot .","265948":"a year or longer .","265949":"not much , depending on how bad of a mood i m in . sometimes talking to friends helps , as well as listening to music .","265950":"not at all .","265951":"it s probably going to last a long time , tbh . with the rate that the vaccines are rolling out now , it ll be quite a while before we see genuine results .","265952":"life experiences .","265953":"too many things to list , haha . i love watching videos of reunions of people with their pets if they haven t seen them for a while like veterans coming back from duty and seeing their dogs for the first time in over a year . it s so heartwarming .","265954":"whatever name they re most comfortably with being called by .","265955":"eh , not really . i tried it a few times when i was younger , and it simply wasn t my thing .","265956":"glitter . everywhere .","265957":"i d much rather live in the country . i don t like urban environments , and the chaos and fast lifestyle of living in a city isn t for me .","265958":"my parents house .","265959":"i ll be honest with you i have no idea about what his education plan is . i ve somewhat kept up with major news , but i haven t delved deeply into what biden is currently planning on doing .","265960":"honestly , the little room i had when i went on a cruise last february was really cute . it had a balcony , so i d go out there on the balcony in the mornings and late at night and just listen to the waves .","265961":"the stigma and misconception that people who are mentally ill are dangerous , manipulative , and will hurt or k ll you automatically . the whole media trope that mentally ill people are inherently dangerous is really archaic , false , and exhausting .","265962":"i m not really educated enough on this subject to have a valid opinion .","265963":"life sentences in prison .","265964":"i m listening to an emo post hardcore pop punk music playlist that i made and totally vibing to the music rn , not gonna lie . i also just popped open a bottle of wine .","265965":"they do sometimes mean it often times , words people say in anger can be what they truly think but are hiding from others .","265966":"words most definitely matter , sometimes even moreso than actions .","265967":"i work for a company .","265968":"parcheesi .","265969":"that sounds absolutely worth it .","265970":"i edited my hair color in this to see what my hair would look like blue again , and i m super excited to get it done .","265971":"time has always been a bit weird and hazy to me , so the past four years have gone by rather fast for me , all politics aside .","265972":"no worries at all ! ! i m glad you responded , and you know that i m always open about my mental health journey . i ll definitely look into it thank you ! !","265973":"it s okay , i m comfortable with posting . that sounds wonderful ! ! i know a lot of trauma sorta . . . stores itself in the body , in a way ? at least that s what i learned from my previous therapist , it can manifest in a lot of physical symptoms which is why a lot of people with mental health issues also have physical health issues . i m always willing to look into a recommendation , if you don t mind ! ! i was reading a self help book about toxic ab sive parents a while ago and it was very insightful as well .","265974":"it s too early in the year to really determine that , i think . we re only for some people days into . i have some kind of hope for though , especially considering the covid vaccine has been rolling out and we re entering a new presidential administration .","265975":"not really , no . if anything , competition motivates me .","265976":"overall , i honestly just want to write and publish a book , as well as travel more often when time allows .","265977":"yeah at this point , i delete repeated questions that i ve answered several times before . as for which questions i like to be asked , i prefer personalized questions related to things like music , art , mental health , video games , my education and career , movies and television shows , etc etc .","265978":"i m not sure when this question was sent , but i honestly had no idea it was happening when it was happening because i was working . my roommate had come home from work and asked me about it , so i googled it immediately . absolutely ridiculous sh t .","265979":"honestly . . . i really love the borat movies . lmaoo .","265980":"having more control over my mental illnesses and utilizing healthy coping mechanisms .","265981":"buying gifts for my friends off of etsy , since etsy does a lot of personalization of items .","265982":"you ? by two feet . identity by grandson . twisted by missio .","265983":"does escargot count ? i enjoyed it too , ahah .","265984":"yes , without a doubt . i ve seen read so many horror stories about people who own ab se their pets , or neglect them because they re uneducated and stubborn , and it s incredibly sad . not everyone has the capacity to take responsibility of what it means to be a pet owner .","265985":"nothing really . i sleep quite well most nights , and i can fall asleep pretty much anywhere at any time .","265986":"yeah , on a few occasions . i can t recall what any of them were about , though .","265987":"lack of a healing from trauma , chemical deficiency in my brain , dependency issues , mental illnesses , and self esteem issues .","265988":"breathing exercises , grounding techniques , and anti anxiety medication .","265989":"i ve honestly never seen the star wars movies , lol .","265990":"black ink , always .","265991":"i think surveillance in general is a bit wrong , although i m not educated enough on the topic to have a well thought out opinion .","265992":"i don t believe everyone does , no .","265993":"living in the moment , most definitely . even though i have my bad days , i m more stable in the present moment than ever before . i would never want to relive my life again .","265994":"yes , it s extremely disrespectful and in poor taste .","265995":"this month has honestly flown by for me , i can t believe we re more than halfway through the month at this point . i can t even recall anything that i ve done this month at all .","265996":"hanging out with my friends and having a few beers together while we talk bullsh t .","265997":"it tasted like regular , cold green tea ice cream but it was covered in a layer of warm fried dough , which complemented the coldness very well . it was super delicious .","265998":"music , writing , video games , and mental health awareness .","265999":"every phase of my life has had its ups and downs . i guess my teenage years were among the worst , though , considering that s what i remember most about the ab se that occurred .","266000":"not with my own family , no . i get along well with my friends families , though .","266001":"i don t plan on having children . either way , i m anti circumcision .","266002":"yes , i have two cats .","266003":"yes , quite often actually . a lot of it has to do with my job if i need more information about something .","266004":"no , not generally . the only soda i ll drink is mountain dew voltage and baja blast .","266005":"i prefer roses over sunflowers .","266006":"my day has been . . . eventful , to say the least . i was on the verge of a mental breakdown this morning , but managed to collect myself and finish work successfully . i ve been watching television with my roommate ever since , and now i m trying to re organize and answer my askfm questions .","266007":"yes , i love video games .","266008":"i used to be obsessed with their song michael .","266009":"i have seven tattoos .","266010":"i have an android phone .","266011":"no , that sounds silly . it would basically turn into one of those facebook games where people would constantly request you to play with them , and it would get super old super fast .","266012":"les miserables , sweeney todd , the crow , american psycho , the shining , girl interrupted , heathers , the punisher , the lord of the rings trilogy , and queen of the damned .","266013":"yes , i believe they do .","266014":"skin picking is the most serious habit that i need to stop .","266015":"new york state .","266016":"now that i ve calmed down from this morning s mental breakdown , i have a splitting headache . jfc . i just want this work day to be over so i can sleep .","266017":"i have one , but i don t give it out .","266018":"not new , but the most recent .","266019":"well yeah , that s a different story . i d have to greet people all the time when i worked with the public .","266020":"by not doing it at all .","266021":"i ve been binge watching supernatural for about two months now , haha .","266022":"no , i ve always wanted to go though .","266023":"i just let it ring , tbh . unless i m in the middle of doing something on my phone , then i ll decline it .","266024":"yes , i ve had fried green tea ice cream .","266025":"in the s fahrenheit and cloudy .","266026":"i ve been on the verge of a mental breakdown all day , i can t focus on work , and i spent half the morning crying . gotta love it .","266027":"my friends .","266028":"i m content with what i m doing currently drinking and watching television .","266029":"no , not that i m aware of at least .","266030":"my bed , haha .","266031":"serotonin .","266032":"i bought a malibu mixed cocktail pouch of rum punch with a bunch of different tropical flavors and it s delicious .","266033":"i don t have much knowledge of it personally , but perhaps you can ask respectable questions to astoldbyjoanna .","266034":"no one is ever too old to have friends , the idea of being without friends as an older person is honestly very sad . until the day someone d es at an elderly age , they should always have friends around .","266035":"yeah , it s pretty much my favorite genre .","266036":"yeah , i use twitter often .","266037":"my love for video games .","266038":"i joke about most things rarely take things super seriously , so i m not very sensitive at all .","266039":"my favorite animals are wolves .","266040":"abandonment .","266041":"i had work therapy , then my roommate and i had dinner and watched a few episodes of letterkenny . now i m drinking and watching supernatural .","266042":"pretty much the same , especially since i keep to myself even when my mental health is acting up .","266043":"yes , i worked today .","266044":"no , i haven t .","266045":"yes , when prepared right , it tastes very good .","266046":"depends on my mood . sometimes i m more comfortable motivated in the morning , while other times it s at night .","266047":"definitely me . i m getting so burnt out .","266048":"i had work therapy , so not fun at all . lmao .","266049":"you ll understand that it isn t when you approach . especially if you have people around you who are already older than you .","266050":"idk , in my personal opinion it s anywhere from like and up . but everyone has their own definition of old and young .","266051":"yeah , and is young .","266052":"i m all right just taking a small break from work since i had a meeting during my lunch break . i m tired and i m looking forward to laying down and possibly napping when i clock out , haha .","266053":"sadness , anger , euphoria , and numb .","266054":"yes , i m young .","266055":"well , the weekend is nearly over for me although this shoutout was probably sent super late like the rest of the shoutouts across askfm . despite that , it was a relaxing weekend and a much needed break from the stress of work over the past weeks .","266056":"i ve been enjoying deal with it by ashnikko lately . https www . youtube . com watch ? v dxgelmwqfm","266057":"i haven t gone outside besides to go to the store in like , months . lmaoo .","266058":"circumcision is g nital m tiliation . capital punishment is archaic , inhumane , and injust . people have the freedom to get abortions regardless of their reason . self diagnosis of complex mental illnesses is wrong , and just because you think you may have symptoms of a certain illness doesn t mean you can outright say i have x disorder . marijuana should be legalized on both a medical and recreational level .","266059":"i prefer to watch movies alone .","266060":"not in the near future , no .","266061":"i haven t taken any pictures today . however , i ve been lounging around the house and perusing social media since i woke up , so there isn t really much to see .","266062":"veggie burrito bowls , sushi , and lamb rice platters .","266063":"relaxing , thankfully . i spent yesterday being somewhat productive , and then winded down in the evening with some movies and drinks . i m currently debating on what i want for dinner , and then i m going to continue watching night stalker on netflix .","266064":"sometimes when i don t feel like cooking eggs on the stove , i crack an egg into a mug with a little splash of milk and some salt , and i microwave it for seconds .","266065":"definitely not at least not me . i don t understand how so many trump supporters insist that the election was rigged despite the plethora of evidence indicating that the counts are correct biden won fair and square . unbelievable .","266066":"syndicate took place in victorian era england , which is another one of my favorite cultural historical eras . i mostly played as evie because she seemed more of a stealth character to me , and i loved the introduction of famous figures much like previous ac games , but i liked these characters more , lol . there was also a part about jack the ripper i don t remember if it was part of the original story or a dlc , but nevertheless , it was very compelling .","266067":"valhalla is definitely in my top favorite ac games , for sure , especially because i ve always loved stuff related to nordic culture , vikings , etc etc . my ultimate favorite ac game is syndicate . i haven t gotten very far into valhalla because there s honestly so much to do and the map is so extensive , but it s an absolutely beautiful game . i highly recommend it if you re an ac fan .","266068":"well , i certainly hope so .","266069":"i have an xbox one . lately i ve been playing assassin s creed valhalla . i also play halo with my friends on occasion .","266070":"console . i ve tried playing games on pc , but i can never get used to the mouse and keyboard .","266071":"music and video games .","266072":"purple and red , or black and red .","266073":"yes , i would change it so that i wouldn t have started self h rming as a pre teen .","266074":"i don t have mine anymore , but i had the original gameboy , gameboy color , and gameboy advanced when i was younger .","266075":"i haven t seen many marvel films , but i liked guardians of the galaxy .","266076":"yesterday , i treated myself by cleaning the house it makes me feel better sometimes , idk why , taking a hot shower , getting dressed , watching movies , and drinking a cocktail .","266077":"waking up and having the first cup of coffee of the day . being outside in chilly , yet sunny weather . having deep conversations with friends . being outside in the backyard at night with a campfire , friends , and brews . listening to good music .","266078":"probably bus .","266079":"take time out for self care and self reflection , in whichever way is best for that individual person . self care looks different depending on who it is , so it can be anything from taking an extra long shower to reading a book in silence to disconnecting from social media and electronics , etc etc .","266080":"meteora by linkin park . it was the first album that i ever purchased and listened to , and linkin park grew to not only become my favorite band , but also a source of inspiration and hope for me .","266081":"i think social media can have the tendency to harm a person s mental health , especially on sites such as askfm , where there s a lot of anonymous cyber bullying . social media isn t a necessity , of course . so if a person feels overwhelmed by social media and feels the need to delete their accounts , they have the freedom to do so . what s better is different for each person , so it s hard to make a universal statement on it .","266082":"world spins madly on by the weepies .","266083":"this requires me to know what other people think of me , and tbh i really have no idea how other people see me , lol .","266084":"not as often as i would like . i took dante s inferno off of my bookshelf this morning and i was debating on flipping through it today .","266085":"not intentionally , no . i ve developed a small collection of mugs and wine glasses over the years , though .","266086":"yes , it happened a few times in the past .","266087":"i think what s more concerning is when people have strong political opinions based on little information , and then express those opinions as if they are educated in politics especially if they re putting forth rhetoric that s just flat out inaccurate . politics is one of those hot subjects that everyone wants to have a say in , it s just the way people are .","266088":"i watched as above so below for the first time last night , and it s definitely in my top favorite movies now . i ve seen a lot of people recommend it , and it definitely lived up to the hype .","266089":"my little movie night setup from last night , haha .","266090":"not at all . i have no regrets with our former relationship .","266091":"eh , i don t think so . as long as you re thankful for the gift and express to the person who got you that gift that you appreciate them thinking of you , there s nothing wrong with returning it if it isn t something you think you can use .","266092":"the question was who is , meaning in the present tense . i don t currently have a one , true love . it was most definitely true while we were dating and while i was in love with him , but my feelings nor his are the same anymore . and no , i definitely don t hate him . we re still good friends .","266093":"logging into my work email tomorrow and having to sort through everything i missed because i clocked out early on friday .","266094":"evidently he isn t my one true love because we re not together anymore , and i don t think we ll ever get back together in the future .","266095":"my roommate s girlfriend . she s so incredibly chill and down to earth , and i always love seeing her and hanging out with her . she brings great vibes .","266096":"i m not in a toxic , unhealthy , and ab sive environment anymore .","266097":"i m doing all right i feel a bit anxious and off , for some reason , but otherwise i m okay . i m listening to slow music and i m kinda in the mood to write , but i m not sure what i should write about .","266098":"i don t have one .","266099":"for the most part , yes . i m just happy that i m living independently and not with my parents anymore .","266100":"yeah , especially if you keep looking at your phone instead of looking at the person while talking . it s one of my biggest pet peeves .","266101":"the hairstyle i currently have now longish on one side , shaved on the other . i also have an undercut on the long side and in the back .","266102":"yes , plenty of times .","266103":"having coffee . it s one of the primary motivators for me to get out of bed in the morning .","266104":"i haven t even thought about lunch , let alone dinner , haha . i might make breakfast for dinner , though . we have a lot of eggs , and scrambled eggs are one of my comfort foods .","266105":"keeping my mental health and impulses under control , reading for extended periods of time , and having a stable routine regarding my creative writing instead of writing fervently for a week and then going months without writing at all .","266106":"no problem , i hope everything turns out okay for you in the end . you have to prioritize your own health and needs .","266107":"i understand this all too well . eventually , you have to tell yourself that you ve become dependent on this person for your own happiness , but you re not actually happy with them . they continually hurt you , and to be frank , they probably know and are leveraging that to keep you close .","266108":"sometimes you have to weigh the pros and cons of being friends or in a relationship with this person or people like this in general . if it s detrimental to your well being or mental health , then you may be better off cutting them out of your life . in certain circumstances , people like this will eventually realize they re wrong , admit it , and work on themselves to being a better person . but if you have the sense that this will never happen with them , then you re under no obligation to continue associating with this person .","266109":"my mental health .","266110":"well . . . the fact that he s accusing you of cheating via text message instead of face to face is a bit immature and silly , ngl . i feel like that s the type of conversation worth having in person , not over messaging where it s easy to misconstrue meaning or feelings .","266111":"people who are creative artsy , passionate about their interests , mature and not willing to put up with bullsh t or drama , etc etc . all of my friends have similar interests with me , which also helps a lot .","266112":"on the very rare occasion , yes .","266113":"anxiety , unfortunately .","266114":"just because someone is quiet doesn t mean they re incapable of speaking , haha . just find a subject to talk about that makes both people comfortable , and go from there .","266115":"it s so weird to hear movies from the s and s be referred to as old , lol . regardless , yes most of my favorite movies are from the s .","266116":"haha , i mean if you are asking for advice i would really only quit a job without a backup as a last resort if it was affecting my health that badly , meaning i literally couldn t wait any longer . however , coming from my own personal experiences , even though the jobs i ve had in the past were terrible , i still somehow stuck it out until i found a new job before putting my notice in . that alone was enough to kinda stabilize me a bit more , because if i quit a job without having a backup , then i would probably freak out even more .","266117":"yeah , i used to play on the snes and the n when i was younger .","266118":"eventually , sure . it isn t a priority of mine , though .","266119":"i do , yes . i have to be in a certain mood to listen to it , though .","266120":"i can t see the stars where i live .","266121":"personally speaking , no . i ve always had backup jobs lined up when i wanted to quit a job to ensure that i always had a steady source of income .","266122":"i think it looks great on some people . a few years ago , my hair was blue with some gray silver strands in it , and it looked really nice .","266123":"hello , that would be me .","266124":"let s see what the sh tstorm has rolled in today .","266125":"when i want to be , yes .","266126":"i honestly don t remember , it s been a while since i ve watched it .","266127":"anywhere between , i would assume .","266128":"i watched the first season a long time ago , yes .","266129":"dim lights on , and sometimes music playing in the background .","266130":"i have an xbox one , and have been using xbox consoles since the original xbox console came out .","266131":"i just logged back into my old tumblr account , lol . i know i quit tumblr because it was unhealthy for me , but i m feelings things and now i m just scrolling through my page and looking at everything i posted between .","266132":"type diabetes .","266133":"my writing , my compassion for others , and my dedication loyalty to my friends .","266134":"i don t want to be famous . however , if i had no choice , it would be for my writing .","266135":"i try to show my love for people through what i interpret to be their love language , whether it s through words of affirmation or gifts or physical touch . for my ex , i normally had encouraging words to say , would buy him things that reminded me of him , sent him music that reminded me of him , etc etc . as for how i d like to be shown love , i ve taken quizzes that said that my primary love language is through words of affirmation . i like being told how much i mean to people , being validated for my thoughts and feelings , and being reassured .","266136":"susanna kaysen from girl interrupted , ironically enough .","266137":"i was a weirdo , haha . i was one of those goth turned scene turned punk artsy folks .","266138":"yes , they re an older relative .","266139":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","266140":"i ve always played it on xbox one .","266141":"yellow .","266142":"i d rather not .","266143":"hello , hi . that would be me .","266144":"i ve never been to a protest before , no . there s nothing wrong with protesting unless it escalates and it turns into a riot or something worse like what happened at the capitol .","266145":"pancakes .","266146":"skyrim .","266147":"she wants to do a second christmas since my father just got home from florida , and she decided last minute to schedule it for tomorrow at noon . she said to me , well i want to take the christmas decorations down after doing it , and i can t do that until he opens his gifts , and i said we don t need the decorations for him to open his gifts . . . and she wouldn t accept that answer . smh . i can t win .","266148":"it s been fine , although now i m a bit angry because my mother gave me such an attitude over the phone simply because i told her that i wanted to stay home and relax tomorrow instead of going to her house . god forbid i do something for myself and take time for self care relaxation . i mean , i don t think i m in the wrong . just because i m free doesn t mean i m available .","266149":"you realize those are fictional television shows , right ? i think the show sex the city took place in manhattan , but i don t live there . locations in movies and shows are very unrealistic and don t represent how it actually is .","266150":"to some degree , yes .","266151":"lol wut .","266152":"not all of them , but a select few of them , yes .","266153":"yeah , i got mine last week or so .","266154":"claustrophobia .","266155":"this is true , but there s still racial profiling in law enforcement particularly toward the black community .","266156":"uh , the fact that you re referring to black people as blacks seems a bit condescending to me . regardless , yeah black people are targeted more by authorities , particularly police officers and other people in law enforcement .","266157":"any of bert kreischer s comedy specials on netflix . he s probably my number one favorite comedian right now .","266158":"tiger king was a wild ride .","266159":"i don t have one , haha . i don t look at brands when i look for shoes to purchase . i also haven t bought new shoes in like . . . over a year .","266160":"oh , of course . lol . your covid infected fingers are going to reach through my laptop s screen and strangle me , obviously .","266161":"look at these cuties .","266162":"lol , no . he contributes a lot to the house , especially in terms of grocery shopping and dropping off the rent check , etc etc . i haven t gone grocery shopping in a few months because he tends to do it as soon as he gets out of work , and i m still working by the time he gets home .","266163":"he s doing great , thankfully ! ! he tested positive on new years day , so we all quarantined for days . he got re tested on the th and came up negative , so he was able to return to work this week . as for symptoms , he luckily didn t have any severe symptoms . he lost his taste smell , but he s slowly getting it back . he s so fortunate it wasn t anything worse .","266164":"no , my roommates and i pretty much take turns or clean together , depending on how much spare time we all have . i m off every weekend , so i like vacuuming since i have nothing else going on . my one roommate tends to do the dishes most often , and my other roommate takes out the garbage and cardboard and recycling . i can never remember the damn garbage schedule .","266165":"productive i just cleaned and vacuumed , so the house looks pretty good .","266166":"considering my bedroom is right next to my roommate s bedroom , there s a much greater chance of me getting covid from him , considering courtneyuwu lives thousands of miles away from me . lol .","266167":"i slept until am , i

something i don t do because i m always trying to busy myself with various things throughout the day , haha .","266252":"that s common . but at least they have the knowledge that you are willing to help .","266253":"that may be true , yes . i haven t read up on it in a while , but i think i read somewhere that nordic countries are also among the happiest countries in the world .","266254":"a wolf , if they count .","266255":"ah , yes . i forgot that nascar was obviously the turning point and highlight of american culture .","266256":"i would assume some european countries , particularly the nordic countries .","266257":"i don t believe the united states is the best country in the world .","266258":"coming from someone who is mentally unstable hi , that s me , one of the best things you can do is simply be there for them to offer support when they need it . whether they want to vent to you , have you there in quiet for comfort , or just having the knowledge that you re willing to help even if they haven t asked for help can be the difference between life and death .","266259":"yeah , i was often as in on a regular basis , almost daily yelled at for a variety of stupid things , such as coupons being expired , items not ringing up on sale even though the sale had ended , the customer s credit card getting declined , the price of items in general and how they re cheaper in other stores , etc . management was relatively understanding , although my store manager was a mess and constantly expected the most out of everyone to the point where it was unrealistic . after i had put in my two weeks notice , he called me on my last day of work and asked if i could work a hour shift two weeks from that day even though i wasn t going to be with the company anymore starting my new job already . he was ridiculous .","266260":"i wholeheartedly agree with you . i feel privileged to have been able to transition to working from home and keeping my job during the pandemic . so many people i know lost their jobs , got laid off or furloughed , etc etc . it s such a saddening and frustrating thing to see , and also for those people to go through on top of dealing with the pandemic itself . i like my job a lot , even though they had to make certain amends to salaries to remain afloat they decreased our salaries by across the board . i actually clocked out early at pm today because i had a huge anxiety attack and could barely breathe , and i m lucky that i have the proper pto to be able to do so in the first place .","266261":"it is a lot of people i know work in retail environments and they re given hell on a daily basis by customers who have absolutely no respect or regard for retail workers in general . it s absolutely disgusting .","266262":"highly doubtful , considering i m mentally ill , drink copious amounts of alcohol , vape , and have a long history of serious physical illnesses in my family . but , who knows .","266263":"honestly , i would likely work part time anyway just to give myself some sort of routine .","266264":"vape and drink alcohol , i would assume .","266265":"i don t really feel any particular way , but it makes me chuckle when cashiers and other retail workers tell people , you have to put the mask over your nose or if you don t put a mask on , i m going to ask you to leave . cashiers are given a lot of sh t , especially now more than ever before , and it makes the former retail worker in me happy that cashiers now are advocating for safety and won t back down .","266266":"i really have no idea how it s produced , lol . i m not a wine expert . i just prefer white wine over red wine most of the time because it tastes better to me .","266267":"i m single .","266268":"the major anxiety attack i had this afternoon . gotta love it .","266269":"no , it gives me major anxiety when i have to talk to somebody on the phone unless they re a close friend of mine .","266270":"haha , nah . my caffeine intake is mainly through coffee , tea , and energy drinks on occasion .","266271":"sometimes you gotta pick and choose your battles . even if they come onto your feed and you dislike those people albeit for superficial reasons , in my personal opinion , you don t have to read their answers or engage with them .","266272":"it doesn t sound like something i would like , considering i dislike soda like coke and pepsi . to mix coffee with it would be strange , in my opinion .","266273":"no , it ll be a long time before we see the disappearance of covid , i m assuming .","266274":"if you dislike so many people and askfm in general , why bother even frequenting the site to begin with ? rofl .","266275":"i ve never seen it before , so i would assume no . but according to trusty ole google , apparently it s coming to the united states relatively soon this year .","266276":"not really , i only ever check the number of people who follow me when anons ask me how many followers i have .","266277":"water , shelter , food , etc etc . on a more superficial level , i can t live without caffeine .","266278":"not going to lie i m awkward around children because i don t know how to talk or relate to them until they turn like years old .","266279":"who knows if i ll even live to see , lol .","266280":"friday night as soon as i ve clocked out of work .","266281":"obviously the s , considering people such as myself would have had much more rights compared to the th century .","266282":"i normally wear boots .","266283":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","266284":"likely to get other people s perspectives on the situation .","266285":"i don t have any plans . i haven t cleaned in a while , so my only objective is to vacuum the house .","266286":"if i had to choose between them all , i d say floral . however , most of my clothing are solid colors .","266287":"i prefer science over mathematics , although the two have somewhat of a correlation with each other .","266288":"i had a bag of garden vegetable rice , because i m the epitome of health .","266289":"i honestly don t remember . i frequent the same places when i do go out to purchase alcohol , so they know me at this point and don t need to ask for my id .","266290":"happy and healthy haven t been in my vocabulary for months .","266291":"haha , yes . my roommates and i often argue over who should pay for dinner on occasion not like , real arguing though .","266292":"lol , yes . my entire teenage years were composed of reading and writing fanfiction .","266293":"i saw a tiktok where it was like , someone was showing their id to a cashier when purchasing alcohol and the cashier goes , oh i can see the in your birth year , you re fine . like . . . my mind was blown . damn .","266294":"i don t usually daydream because i try to distract myself at every minute of the day . if i m not working , then i m scrolling through social media or watching something on television or playing video games .","266295":"europe , australia , and new zealand .","266296":"sure , why not . i m not a big fan of pineapple , but that doesn t mean that other people aren t allowed to enjoy it .","266297":"uh , no ? rofl . i wake up at am every day .","266298":"no , not usually . i shop because i have to , not because i want to .","266299":"yeah . all of the ones i ve tried were really gross , tbh

regular basis .","266316":"drink and or smoke weed and listen to music .","266317":"a few weeks ago when my roommate s father came over . he s a staunch republican and is very pro trump and anti anything left leaning , including blm calling them thugs and everything else . i don t even remember what the conversation was about , but i just stayed quiet the entire time because i didn t want to involve myself in an argument confrontation . luckily , my other roommate his niece was arguing with him and her i share the same beliefs , so i didn t need to say anything . lmao .","266318":"honestly , not very well . i ve gained a greater appreciation for the home i live in and the relationships i have with my friends and roommates , but i ve also been drowning myself in drugs and alcohol . . . so , yeah .","266319":"i definitely read this as condiment and i was going to answer with honey mustard . lmaoo .","266320":"i m currently listening to avril lavigne because my friend brought her up in conversation , haha . i m listening to nobody s home , it used to be one of my favorite songs of hers when i was much younger .","266321":"yes , . it s one of my worst fears .","266322":"my best friend and i met when we were both years old , so we ve been friends for years . we met in middle school we sat at the same lunch table , and we started talking about music and discovered we both had the same favorite band .","266323":"fire by two feet . e girls are ruining my life by corpse . cry by ashnikko grimes . my mother told me whoever sings it , it s an old sea shanty . wolves by missio .","266324":"yeah , i ve been pulled over and ticketed for speeding a few years ago .","266325":"my living environment . i live in such a warm , non toxic , supportive household with people who genuinely understand how i feel , and it s such a healthy change compared to how i used to live .","266326":"getting high and listening to music","266327":"my past , particularly in reference to my childhood trauma . i ve been working closely with my therapist on past reflection and trauma healing , especially lately because i ve been having flashbacks often which has never happened before . idk . i feel stable and unstable at the same time if that makes sense ? some days , i m perfectly fine . other days , i m falling apart at the seams and i m flashing back constantly , can t sleep , turn into a manic mess , etc etc .","266328":"dragonball z and thundercats .","266329":"the friendships relationships they have established with others . a lot of people take their friendships for granted and sometimes take advantage of their friends whether they realize it or not because they re of the belief that their friend won t judge them or think of them any differently for it .","266330":"well , i don t know if it applies anymore . because i ve learned to enjoy it again . but the show supernatural . i used to be obsessed with the show years ago and watched most of the seasons i think i made it up to seasons or . i made a very close friend here on askfm who shared my obsession with the show , and we talked regularly . after a wild course of events , that person was outed to actually be a terrible , despicable , disgusting human being and i cut them out of my life entirely . blocked them on every social media . for a long time , i couldn t watch supernatural because it reminded me of them . but now a lot of time has passed , and i ve been able to watch the show again without thinking about them .","266331":"housing , considering it s my most expensive bill per month .","266332":"sushi , veggie burrito bowls , lamb rice platters with white sauce , jambalaya , and pasta .","266333":"yes , i love video games . admittedly , i haven t played in quite a while , though .","266334":"the luxuries i accept in my life are good drinks and going to the hair salon , haha . even though getting my hair cut and colored is absurdly expensive most of the time , it s absolutely worth it .","266335":"i don t really scroll through many websites besides social media , youtube , and amazon . however , i also really love watching people stream video games on twitch . i used to use reddit , but i haven t logged on in a very long time .","266336":"netflix , amazon prime , and spotify .","266337":"i want to eventually get a black and white writing quill on my right forearm . i also want a traditional styled dagger with skulls and roses on the back of my forearm .","266338":"yes , true crime is perhaps my favorite genre of television shows and documentaries .","266339":"i like yellow tail pinot grigio , when it comes to white wine . in terms of red wine , i like cabernet sauvignon and syrah . cupcake and the dreaming tree both make good red wine blends .","266340":"yeah , but i mainly use it to scroll through my for you page and find hilarious videos to share with friends .","266341":"i ve only ever played animal crossing pocket camp on my phone , but it was a cute game .","266342":"listening to calming music , lighting a candle , and having some wine to drink .","266343":"it differs for each person , but in general , the best forms of self care are things that make each person feel the best version of themselves . some people like to pamper themselves with things like baths , lotions , candles , etc etc . , while some other forms of self care can be artistic endeavors . whatever it is as long as it makes you feel good about yourself and brings about a sense of peace within yourself , then it s self care .","266344":"no , i am neither spiritual nor religious .","266345":"my bedroom or my living room .","266346":"i have a mixed media painting hung up on my bedroom wall that my ex commissioned a friend of ours to paint for me as a gift a few years ago . even though my ex and i have been broken up , i still value the painting because it s so incredibly well done and i ve always appreciated art .","266347":"i used to be in support of capital punishment when i was younger , and i held that belief for quite a few years . however , over the past maybe . . . years ? . . . my stance has changed , and now i disagree with capital punishment . over the course of those years , i ve learned the implications of capital punishment and how not only does it mean that perfectly innocent people could be put to d ath and exonerated after they pass , but it s also inhumane and an archaic means by which to punish someone for a crime .","266348":"i don t believe they are , no . i watched them both when i was a teenager , and i wish i could watch them again somehow without buying them , haha .","266349":"it depends on what the opinion is . there s a major difference between people disagreeing that pineapple belongs on pizza or that women should have equal rights as men just as examples . if someone s opinion is directly discriminating against or oppressing a group of people , such as being sexist or ableist or transphobic or homophobic , then that isn t exactly an opinion , that s bigotry .","266350":"it s a tie between hard candy and high tension . both are incredibly dark and disturbing movies .","266351":"i ve never loved my smile , but i m learning to accept it as i ve gotten older .","266352":"being in a new environment with which i m unfamiliar , such as a store or a restaurant bar , or even someone else s house . i m always incredibly anxious and nervous about going to new places especially if i m alone .","266353":"i haven t done much today at all . i worked from am to pm , and during my breaks , i tried to clean the house a little bit wiping down the counters , taking out the garbage , organizing the living room , etc . after work , i fed the cats and ordered dinner for myself . now i m listening to music and organizing my askfm inbox answering questions .","266354":"psychological thrillers .","266355":"i prefer xbox solely for familiarity s sake . i ve always owned xbox consoles my entire life .","266356":"i have seven tattoos . i m planning on getting two more in the upcoming future , although i do eventually want to get most of my body covered in tattoos .","266357":"speaking to people in general outside of my regular friend group . i was forced to confront my social anxiety when i began working a retail job , but ever since i started working in various office jobs , i ve lost that tolerance for talking to strangers , haha . i m still quite socially anxious , but at least i feel confident in talking to cashiers and whatnot .","266358":"even though j . k . rowling is a trash excuse of a human being , i do love the character of draco malfoy and have always had a slight obsession with his character and tom felton too .","266359":"yes , almost too easy , lol . i can fall asleep to pretty much anything . my roommates always ask me if they re being too loud when they know i m about to go to bed , and honestly , they could be vacuuming or yelling and it wouldn t bother me whatsoever .","266360":"i m not hungry , so i don t feel like eating anything . although i m debating on either cracking open a beer or pouring myself a cocktail .","266361":"i dislike the structure of my face with the exception of my cheekbones which aren t very prominent anymore because i ve gained weight . i d like to have a more defined jawline . i d like to lose pounds . i d like to stop skin picking so my arms aren t littered with scabs and scars , and then i can get more tattoos .","266362":"i quit smoking in after smoking a pack per day for years . these days , i vape on occasion .","266363":"when i went on a cruise last february , i rarely ever had service so i went most of the day without using my phone at all besides to take photos . during that time , i d just walk the cruise ship , sit at the pub , grab something to eat , listen to live music , etc etc .","266364":"i used to write in a journal as part of my therapy sessions , but i haven t done it in months . i never really got into a solid routine with it .","266365":"i just say thank you , although it really depends on what they re complimenting me on and how appropriate or inappropriate it is .","266366":"yes , i absolutely love musicals . some of my favorites are rent , les miserables although i ve never seen it live , sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street , the rocky horror picture show , and memphis .","266367":"the house that i live in , specifically the relaxing environment of my bedroom when i have my ambient lights on and i m sitting in bed watching television .","266368":"no , none of my irl friends or family use askfm to my knowledge . although i can say that courtneyuwu is an irl friend of mine since we did meet on two occasions .","266369":"i try my best to relax on the weekends , so that mainly entails sleeping in as long as possible , listening to music especially if i m doing laundry or cleaning , watching television and or movies , perusing social media on my laptop , and playing video games .","266370":"yes , i have two cats named teddy and braxton . braxton is a smaller gray white cat who s very timid and doesn t know how to meow , and teddy is a black white mainecoon who has separation anxiety .","266371":"both , to some extent . i try to save as much money as i can , but occasionally i do splurge on things such as food .","266372":"i prefer lightly sweetened iced black tea . when it comes to hot tea , i don t sweeten it at all .","266373":"they re old songs that sailors and pirates would sing on their voyages , derived from the th century , where they would harmonize with one another and seldom used actual instruments . lately , tiktok has popularized sea shanties since people have been posting videos of them covering old sea shanties , and they ve become sorta the new trend there , ahah .","266374":"my roommate . my asked me how i was doing feeling since my mental state has been a bit weird lately , so i thanked him for asking .","266375":"i started reading fahrenheit by ray bradbury months ago , but i never finished it .","266376":"my friends support in my life , having a stable job throughout this pandemic , having a house to live in independently away from my parents , and caffeine .","266377":"sea shanties , ahah .","266378":"my happiness levels or lack thereof don t depend upon my belief in free will . i do believe in free will as opposed to destiny fate , and i believe that everyone has the capability of making their own choices which can affect themselves and others in life , but it s pretty disconnected from whether or not i m happy .","266379":"legally speaking , a teenager becomes a legal adult when they turn years old at least in the united states . however , being a mature adult is a lot more complex than simply an age . i know plenty of people who are over the age of and don t act like adults , they still behave like children . when a person is over years old and begins to learn how to take on responsibilities , tries to be independent as much as their mental physical state allows , and cultivates a strong , concrete persona

best friend is one of the strongest people i know emotionally and spiritually speaking . she s endured a lot of hardship throughout her life , and she honestly has the worst of luck especially when it

her path , she has managed to find love , get married , and is in the process of buying a house . i m so incredibly proud of her . she s a true warrior .","266382":"listen to music , watch television

shouldn t have told you these things in the first place .","266390":"iced coffee , iced tea , margaritas , and beer .","266391":"my current job isn t a perfect job for me , but nevertheless , i do
