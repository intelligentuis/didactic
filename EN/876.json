all but i just think even if it never happened that some women would want to experience the world of working and have a job to make income . it also could ve effected the fact that since it never happened women would ve never really had jobs that made an income and they would probably think that their husband should go and do all that and that it wouldn t be okay for them to go out and work without their husbands getting mad at them and or being judged .","810452":"i d honestly think it s a real ghost given that i believe in ghosts and in the paranormal world . i believe that

.","810472":"oh i think in this case he s jealous of you and your boyfriend s relationship and that could be why he turned on you . another reason could be that he likes you more than a friend and he
