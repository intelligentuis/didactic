account just for the kid to use when older instead of the other parent being in charge of the money . . not knowing where it goes . i wouldn t want that for myself . what if i had a kid , they d most likely pull the same move then too . time with the kid s is better than money . there s even video calls or sending cards instead of being a deadbeat dad . why have kids if not mature enough to help out , stick around ? i d rather know that a small amount of money was going towards helping them instead of the guy spending good money on me . i d just feel guilty that they spent stuff on me but too

the double standards in what they just wrote too . nonstop saying the same things instead of anything new . claim its holding someone accountable when it doesn t concern them at all etc they just like bitching , creating drama , having me on their mind when they could actually be doing something else with their time and effort . when the talk about him them doesn t get to me they jump on the racist

went to senior prom with my friend and her stepdad had a car from the s or s that we drove in . was cool . i forget the name of the model atm","347778":"eh . i was in other ways lol lost respect for .","347779":"no , i haven t nor have they hurt me . i ve only hit one person and it was more to stop them from harming another . likewise , i didn t do it to hurt them , just to stop it .","347780":"what is ?","347781":"yes . that would suck . feelings are valid . it shouldn t be taken lightly .","347782":"people s actions and words can be very different in the moment . if i ever did

nah dude . someone has to be better in the relationship . they must have old wounds that need healing too .","347787":"uh how ? i actually wanted to know the anon s views after that question lol","347788":"how about be the bigger person ? let them vent out the frustrations assuming they aren t really trying to hurt you ? , listen to them , walk away , take a step back , cool down . breathe . i suppose it depends on the reason why too . be honest with them . be understanding again situation based lol the women should get the fuck out because its just going to keep repeating the cycle . obviously if the man keeps getting hit then same for him . that s not real love , my dudes","347789":"creepy condoning violence . seems like mental illness , addiction and other such problems would be a factor then . i d rather not be with someone that would lay a hand on me regardless of the circumstances . i ve had people i m close with that have been in those situations , it can only get worse .","347790":"ah ok","347791":"also when it s a choice . some cultures are very disturbing marrying children when they don t have a voice in the matter .","347792":"when you find someone you can t live without , right timing , divine intervention , financial stability , true love . i don t think age truly plays a part . . just whenever it feels right .","347793":"not really sure what you mean by the bands i don t think it s right to hit people . there s obviously a reason why she did something . . lacking in the relationship . hitting someone wont make them want to keep staying with you . it doesn t show them love or that you truly care about them . being dominated in the bedroom and being with a pos guy is very different . literally saw a tik tok vid on ig earlier where this guy hit his girlfriend wife on the legs . they had a young son and the son watched him hit her and then hit him over the head for hitting his mom . the kid is obviously learning bad behavior regardless if he stuck up for the mother .","347794":"it shouldn t have to ? you can have disagreements without getting physical . talk like adults , use words , understanding , feel safe with the person . if into bdsm and stuff then yes , cool but anything else is just red flags and clearly not a good relationship if always fighting in multiple ways .","347795":"some cooler weather would be nice but summer is my favorite season too !","347796":"yes","347797":"domestic dispute one in hs but classmates and teachers stepped in to stop it . i forget the reason but most likely childish xd someone getting hit with a cane one time i was supposed to go to the fair with my friend . i was waiting around and getting tired of it so i started to walk there . her and her then boyfriend pulled up as i was walking . this was the first time i met the guy and they basically spent the whole time fighting . barely went on rides or played games . like why even show up if fighting ? it was just such a shit night lol she actually married him because she got pregnant a few years later , divorced since he was cheating . i don t even think he s in the daughter s life since never mentions her going to his house . . i m sure his mom still sees her tho . glad she s with her now husband and they have kids together , treats his kid like his own etc","347798":"yes , i ve had it before . it s fine . my favorite pie is apple and pumpkin pie . also a chocolate pudding one with graham cracker crust .","347799":"in school , gym tennis dodgeball baseball , i do better with the bigger bats volleyball"}}
