don't know if she was my first love because we were young, but regardless, the first person i developed strong feelings for was my best friend.\n  ","402542":"\n  it isn't normal, no -- however, it *is* very common. if you're thinking this, then you should bring these feelings up to your boyfriend so you two can discuss them.\n  ","402543":"\n  ???\n  \n  it's unfortunate that alcohol is normalized in society, and i'm quite aware of that, but it isn't out of the ordinary for people my age to go out and drink. most of the demographic at the places i go to are people my age & older.\n  \n  also -- god forbid i go out and have a few drinks to celebrate my birthday, lmaoo.\n  ","402544":"\n  i haven't been to burger king in so long, lol. but the last time i went there, i ordered a spicy crispy chicken sandwich without mayonnaise.\n  ","402545":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","402546":"\n  it was a new brewery that i never visited before -- it was *okay* and i probably wouldn't go back again, tbh. the atmosphere was cute, but it seemed very clique-y (everyone there was friends with the bartenders) and the beer was just all right. i took home a growler of pumpkin ale, though.\n  \n  and no, i definitely did not get home early, lmaoo. my original intention was to be home by like 9\/10:00pm, but we ended up leaving the bar at 2:00am. needless to say, i'm exhausted.\n  ","402547":"\n  no, definitely not. i dealt with that a lot growing up from my parents, so i taught myself not to behave in such a way because i didn't want to treat other people the same way my parents treated me.\n  ","402548":"\n  i honestly agree with you. i don't like traveling into the city because the crowds make me completely anxious. i'm usually a nervous wreck when i'm traveling (walking, bus, subway, etc etc) but once i'm at my destination, then i'm okay.\n  ","402549":"\n  it isn't that many in the grand scheme of things, and a lot of my friends have even more tattoos than i do. i eventually want to get my entire body covered, but unfortunately that costs a lot of money.\n  ","402550":"\n  i don't have any upcoming, concrete plans for the week ahead. the only things i know i have to do are go to work, clean the house, perhaps do some light grocery shopping, and go to my therapy appointment.\n  ","402551":"\n  i apologize first if i did something wrong, yes. i'm honestly quite an apologetic person and sometimes i apologize for things that aren't necessarily my fault, which is something i'm trying to work on to better myself.\n  ","402552":"\n  i absolutely adore tattoos & i think they're a beautiful form of art and self-expression. i have seven tattoos and i'm planning two more that i eventually want to get.\n  ","402553":"\n  it honestly depends on the individual -- i can't say that i'm universally likeable or anything because everyone is going to have a different opinion of me.\n  ","402554":"\n  i prefer to shower in the evenings. it's an ideal way for me to wind down and relax after a long day, and i like the feeling of crawling under the covers of my bed freshly clean and smelling nice.\n  ","402555":"\n  no, i don't even want my friends and family to purchase me gifts for my birthday.\n  ","402556":"\n  thanks for the heads up !! it doesn't bother me, it's honestly quite entertaining, lmaoo.\n  ","402557":"\n  yet you're still here talking to me, lol. if you dislike me so much, then you're not being forced to interact with me.\n  ","402558":"\n  you're the one on my profile ... if you're unhappy with the words i say, you have the freedom to leave.\n  ","402559":"\n  there's a \"pale\" filter on it from my phone's camera, but that's all i did to it.\n  ","402560":"\n  there's no reason to be salty, my friend. i'm just informing you of askfm's standards and guidelines regarding verification.\n  ","402561":"\n  yeah, but you have to understand that askfm staff don't know that -- especially considering you're posting photos of celebrities on your profile who aren't you. there's no way to objectively tell that you're \"real.\"\n  ","402562":"\n  no, it doesn't. all i had to prove to askfm was that i was real, i.e. showing them a slip of paper with my username & showing my face alongside that paper.\n  ","402563":"\n  uh, you don't even have photos of yourself on your profile. lmaoo.\n  ","402564":"\n  that doesn't mean that i'm a celebrity. it just means that my account isn't a fake account.\n  ","402565":"\n  28th birthday eve. ?\n  ","402566":"\n  uh, no? lmaoo.\n  ","402567":"\n  my birthday isn't until tomorrow, but thank you regardless !!\n  ","402568":"\n  aw, this is the sweetest message ever. thank you so much !! i hope you have a fantastic night\/day. :'))\n  ","402569":"\n  i honestly can't remember. i don't have much time for self-care these days, so i enjoy partaking in the things i enjoy when i have the opportunity to do so. i feel as if i don't necessarily need to recharge by distancing myself from the things i like.\n  ","402570":"\n  i would like to be remembered for my creativity and compassionate nature, which i channel through my writing and my advocacy for mental health awareness. i want to let others know that they're not alone in their struggles.\n  ","402571":"\n  you can call me \"leigh.\" it isn't very difficult to comprehend.\n  ","402572":"\n  i've been in mental health treatment for almost three years. i see a counselor and a psychiatrist.\n  ","402573":"\n  you may have good intentions, but that doesn't change the fact that i'm uncomfortable with those nicknames. for future reference, i'm not comfortable with feminine descriptions.\n  ","402574":"\n  don't call me \"ma'am\" either, lmaoo. my name is on my profile -- there's no reason you can't call me by my actual name.\n  ","402575":"\n  hello, please don't call me \"honey.\" i'm not comfortable with that nickname and you don't even know who i am.\n  \n  however, i'm doing fine. i'm slowly recovering from my hangover (lol) and i'm finishing up my freelance work this morning. i just made a big pot of coffee so i'm hoping that makes me feel better.\n  ","402576":"\n  last year and the year prior to that, my boyfriend surprised me with tickets to a wine tasting event at a local aquarium. both years were so much fun.\n  ","402577":"\n  from the little bit i know of it, it seems to center on the idea that capitalism results in economic poverty and suffering which is something i agree with. it sounds like a good political ideology in theory, but when put into practice, it doesn't appear that it works out very well.\n  ","402578":"\n  yes, although my lazy days are usually saturdays, lol. however, this past weekend was a bit different -- i did all of my chores and errands yesterday so that i could have a relaxing day today, since i knew i was going to be feeling like sh*t when i woke up this morning (lol).\n  ","402579":"\n  the biggest positive change i've made recently was moving out of my parents' house into a house that i'm currently renting with two roommates. my parents' house was a very toxic environment and deteriorated my mental health, and it was very  difficult for me to pull myself out of depressive states in that sort of environment.\n  \n  since moving out and establishing my own life and routine, i've been much happier, more content with myself, more productive, and almost looking forward to waking up in the morning.\n  ","402580":"\n  depression can't really be cured, but you can most definitely go into remission for depression. the best way to overcome depression and\/or cope with your illness in a healthy manner is to seek out professional treatment, i.e. psychiatry or therapy. however, everyone who struggles with depression is different so there are different modalities of treatment tailored to everyone's unique situation.\n  ","402581":"\n  depends on the reason why they're in debt. if someone has a gambling addiction and is in debt because of it, then i would be more hesitant to date them because that means that they're not careful or responsible with their money.\n  ","402582":"\n  i believe you need to have at least 1,000 followers and contribute to the site on a regular basis (i.e. answering and asking questions routinely). i'm not sure what other criteria there is, though.\n  ","402583":"\n  i honestly don't remember. i don't watch sports in general, so the last football game i watched was probably last year's superbowl.\n  ","402584":"\n  i much prefer to be alone, and if i'm around people like my friends, then i prefer small groups. i value my alone time greatly and i become anxious when there are too many people around me.\n  ","402585":"\n  of course !! i gave everyone candy who came to the door. there were only maybe 6-7 groups of kids, though.\n  ","402586":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm fine, albeit a bit hungover. i ended up celebrating my birthday early last night and stayed out until 2:30am instead of 9\/10:00pm like i originally expected.\n  \n  right now, i'm listening to music and about to continue working on some freelance projects.\n  ","402587":"\n  yes, it's sunny, windy, and cold out rn. i think it's supposed to rain later, though.\n  ","402588":"\n  i'm not jealous, no. like i said, i don't have an interest in the fashion show or just fashion in general.\n  ","402589":"\n  no, i'm not interested in the victoria's secret show or anything remotely related to fashion, lol.\n  ","402590":"\n  aw, thank you !!\n  \n  i'm hoping not to stay out *too* late, since i have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning. i'm thinking about leaving the brewery around 9:00pm or so, that way i can get decent sleep tonight.\n  ","402591":"\n  hi friends ~~\n  \n  ask me some questions while i wait for my friend to pick me up. :'))\n  ","402592":"\n  on halloween, lol. a little girl was knocking on the screen door because she couldn't reach the doorbell.\n  ","402593":"\n  good timing -- just finished my makeup.\n  ","402594":"\n  i don't know if i'll be able to see him on my actual birthday, but regardless, i'm not overly concerned. i don't expect gifts from anyone. i'm past the point where gifts matter to me.\n  ","402595":"\n  i don't really have plans except going out this afternoon with a close friend. we're going to a local brewery.\n  ","402596":"\n  i'm turning 28 years old.\n  ","402597":"\n  yes, you're correct. my birthday is on monday. however, i'm celebrating it with one of my friends today since i won't be able to see her next week at all.\n  ","402598":"\n  it isn't my birthday yet, lol. but thank you !!\n  ","402599":"\n  thanks, i appreciate it ~~\n  ","402600":"\n  i'm doing well. i'm finishing up some laundry, as well as my freelance work that i took on for the weekend. afterwards, i'm going to get ready to go out for the afternoon.\n  ","402601":"\n  no, not usually. i don't surround myself with people who are ungrateful.\n  ","402602":"\n  i don't have a reason as to why you should follow me. that's something you can only decide for yourself.\n  ","402603":"\n  yeah, sometimes it does bother me. i don't usually say anything, though, because i don't really want to cause a scene.\n  ","402604":"\n  no, why would that be weird?\n  ","402605":"\n  i don't give out my personal instagram account because it's private. however, my writing account is @\/mortem.musings !!\n  ","402606":"\n  i can't even fathom being a parent or having children rn.\n  ","402607":"\n  it's a bit of a mess rn, but here ;\n  ","402608":"\n  i suppose the most obvious answer would be the ab*se i endured for most of my life. it completely re-arranged my methods of thinking and my personality, it re-wired connections in my brain, and it kick-started my struggle with mental illness. childhood development is crucial to how someone behaves as an adult, and because i was overcome with ab*se at such an early age, it's affected every aspect of my adult life.\n  ","402609":"\n  in current times, yes. i can't say the same for myself in the past, though. prior to getting treatment for my mental health, my mental illnesses were at an all time peak -- coupled with a significant amount of stress i was enduring earlier in my life. i was obsessive and insecure, and i crossed boundaries that i shouldn't have crossed.\n  ","402610":"\n  i think it really depends on the circumstance, but tbh, i can't really remember a time i was ever crushed by any sort of rejection.\n  ","402611":"\n  i'm doing well. it's not even noon & i already completed half of my freelance work, drank 3 cups of coffee, made and ate breakfast, and did two loads of laundry.\n  ","402612":"\n  a fresh pot of coffee in the morning. \u2661\n  ","402613":"\n  -- terrible drivers on the road (i.e., not using their signal, driving recklessly, cutting people off, etc etc).\n  \n  -- people who speak over me while i'm in the middle of speaking, or similarly, people who barge into a conversation.\n  \n  -- people who claim to understand things but then their actions or words prove just the opposite.\n  \n  -- accidentally dropping or spilling my coffee in the morning.\n  \n  -- people who dismiss mental health problems or claim people are \"crazy\" and cannot be helped.\n  ","402614":"\n  nowhere on my page would it ever hint that i was a fan of donald trump, lmaoo.\n  ","402615":"\n  the most important thing in being a good friend is to simply be honest with your friend and establish open communication with them. also, to be willing to support them in their endeavors while also knowing when to call them out if they're being toxic or problematic.\n  ","402616":"\n  i think it's a healthy combination of both, tbh (granted in healthy relationships). when you meet the right person and the timing is right, it's easy to fall in love. everything seems to fall into place. but if you meet someone and the timing isn't right, for whatever reason, then the interactions may leave you feeling lonely or confused.\n  ","402617":"\n  the funniest & best video i've seen in a while -- \"achievement hunter: the musical.\"\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XrgqFpTVdfs\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","402618":"\n  probably a lot, lmaoo. i'm on my computer for the majority of the morning in light of the freelance work i complete for my job. it usually takes me quite a few hours because i switch between working & then perusing social media.\n  ","402619":"\n  no, i'm not a fan of most sports and i don't watch sports in my spare time.\n  ","402620":"\n  hm, interesting. i wish you luck in your endeavors.\n  ","402621":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","402622":"\n  yeah, i actually have two instagram accounts -- one is personal, and the other is for my writing.\n  \n  honestly, i think it's stupid that they're proposing to get rid of likes. it's essentially the reason why instagram is so popular & they're going to lose a lot of people if they take likes away. i certainly wouldn't be using it as often, especially in terms of my writing account.\n  ","402623":"\n  i have zero plans for next saturday, lol. like i stated in earlier answers, saturdays are my days for relaxation & i seldom leave the house. it will probably just be a routine saturday for me, filled with freelance work and laundry and drinking lots of coffee.\n  ","402624":"\n  i was very sheltered in my youth and was never introduced to them. as an adult, i simply never had the desire to watch them. it didn't seem like something that would catch my interest.\n  ","402625":"\n  saturdays are mainly my days of relaxation & catching up on my freelance work and laundry. i like waking up early in the morning to get everything done.\n  ","402626":"\n  fun fact about leigh ; i've legit never seen a single star wars movie.\n  ","402627":"\n  i don't really do many chores on saturdays, i usually reserve them for sunday mornings. however, i absolutely *hate* cleaning the bathroom.\n  ","402628":"\n  tbh, i generally don't like leaving the house at all on saturdays (lol). i do my errands and grocery shopping on sundays.\n  ","402629":"\n  bulbasaur !! and then for pokemon yellow, obviously pikachu.\n  ","402630":"\n  i go through caffeine withdrawals if i don't drink any coffee by like noon or 1:00pm.\n  ","402631":"\n  i remember going to a restaurant with my boyfriend and his family for his birthday one year, and the menu was unexpectedly expensive af. they had surf & turf for $50 a plate. i didn't order the surf & turf (i honestly don't remember what i did order), but it was ridiculous.\n  ","402632":"\n  yeah, i was really into pokemon back in the day when pokemon red, blue, and yellow came out for the game boy.\n  ","402633":"\n  coffee, hands down. i drink at least 2-3 cups every day -- especially on the weekends.\n  ","402634":"\n  super mario brothers has always been very difficult for me, and it's probably the game i get most frustrated with, lmaoo. i haven't played it in years except for the mario world games that were on the wii a few years ago (those also pissed me off completely).\n  ","402635":"\n  i believe the most important thing i learned was the value of friendship. my teenage years were quite tumultuous and i used the support of my best friend to give me the strength to move forward. i also came across some ex-friends who were very toxic and unhealthy for me, and i learned to be wary of other people's motives.\n  ","402636":"\n  the lord of the rings, particularly in the shire and rivendell. i don't know whether i would be a hobbit or an elf, but i would absolutely have a deep appreciation for literature and nature, and spend my time immersed in them.\n  ","402637":"\n  a hippogriff, of course.\n  ","402638":"\n  shadows everywhere and bugs crawling on the curtains behind my computer.\n  ","402639":"\n  my moods have been pretty even lately, of which i'm quite thankful. however, i do still have periods where i get into depressive mindsets (i haven't been taking my medication routinely, unfortunately) but they usually dissipate within the same day.\n  ","402640":"\n  the longest i've ever stayed awake was around 40 hours, from what i remember. it was during high school and i was experiencing somewhat of a manic phase, so i didn't feel the need to sleep. however, i ended up having visual hallucinations after a while and crashed.\n  ","402641":"\n  i don't have anything to vent about tbh. i've been pretty content and level-headed these days.\n  \n  i'm going to a brewery with a close friend today to celebrate my birthday, so i'm excited for that. :'))\n  ","402642":"\n  when i was younger, i used to love watching gilligan's island and happy days. i also liked the munsters, full house, and frasier.\n  ","402643":"\n  i believe the purpose of life is to give your life its own sense of purpose. everyone will have a different purpose, a different reason to live and keep going forward. it's up to us to figure out what that specific purpose is while also finding our passions in life.\n  ","402644":"\n  i cook fairly often with my roommate these days. i never used to know how to cook but he's been teaching me basic meals, haha. even though breakfast foods are super easy, i love making eggs, bacon and sausages the most in the morning.\n  ","402645":"\n  i haven't done much research on those topics, so while i do know that the united states have performed acts of terrorism on other foreign countries, it isn't something i have strong opinions over.\n  ","402646":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","402647":"\n  kitty was curled up in bed with me last night. :'))\n  ","402648":"\n  a lot of my opinions are things that i'm very passionate about, such as gay and trans rights, mental health awareness, women's rights, etc etc.\n  ","402649":"\n  lately i've been listening to a lot of classical composers. musicians like mozart, beethoven, chopin, debussy, and tchaikovsky.\n  ","402650":"\n  i haven't had a christmas list since i was a pre-teen, haha. i don't ask for anything for christmas, so most of the time my family gives me money (gift cards, cash, etc etc).\n  \n  to treat myself, i do want to get my hair colored & cut (which i'm doing before thanksgiving). i also want to make an appointment to get a new tattoo.\n  ","402651":"\n  \"fragile: may break easily.\"\n  ","402652":"\n  neither, honestly. i don't remember my childhood and my teenage years were terrible, and i would much rather remain an adult.\n  ","402653":"\n  considering i don't know you & you probably mean nothing to me, i have no problem with that.\n  ","402654":"\n

political systems to really answer this question. perhaps if you asked me this ten years ago, i could give a more thorough answer, lol.\n  ","402673":"\n  that's correct, yes. it may have been founded with democracy in mind, but as far as i'm concerned, it isn't a democracy anymore.\n  ","402674":"\n  having support from friends and\/or family is a great means by which to overcome self-doubt. i mean, self-doubt can be inevitable for some people but it's certainly validating when you have trusted people around you who are rooting for you and confirming that you're doing well.\n  ","402675":"\n  no. when it comes to presidential elections, the popular vote doesn't matter. and as far as politics are concerned, most politicians just say what they believe civilians want to hear and once they're in office, they either change their views or put forth their own agenda, or both.\n  ","402676":"\n  yes and no, tbh. yes in the sense that i believe technology and medicine are advancing greatly, but no in the sense that the governments of the world only have their best interests at heart and are dismissing important issues like civil rights and climate change, which affects everyone.\n  ","402677":"\n  i mean, i have my location on my phone on at all times for google maps & whatnot, so evidently i'm not too concerned with information of my whereabouts being broadcasted to big corporations like google.\n  \n  if someone wants to harm me, then so be it. they're going to find out this information one way or another anyway regardless of data companies' efforts to track me if they wanted to hurt me so badly. people have done it in the past without technology, they can easily do it again.\n  ","402678":"\n  it isn't concerning to me, no. if companies are constructing a profile of me based on what i spend my money on and which websites i visit, then all they're going to learn is that i enjoy eating food, drinking alcohol and coffee, paying necessary bills, and perusing social media.\n  ","402679":"\n  again -- i don't really care, lol. companies can construct whatever profile they want of me, it doesn't actually determine who i am or how i spend my time in my life.\n  ","402680":"\n  honestly, it's been years since i went a full day without using my phone. :\/ the last time i remember doing so, i was on vacation and decided to disconnect entirely for the day. it was a freeing feeling, but it also made me anxious knowing that a family member could potentially be trying to get in contact with me in case of an emergency.\n  ","402681":"\n  it doesn't really concern me greatly. it's not as if i'm doing anything or spending money illegally.\n  ","402682":"\n  oh, i wouldn't mind that either. i usually pay for things with my credit\/debit cards. i seldom carry actual cash on me.\n  ","402683":"\n  aw, thank you !!\n  ","402684":"\n  i don't really know if that's do-able in today's age, but i wouldn't mind it. we would just go back to bargaining and trading.\n  ","402685":"\n  no, i have no interest in that. i'd rather just use cash or credit.\n  ","402686":"\n  acceptance of people who struggle with mental illness. there have been advancements somewhat in recent years regarding awareness of mental health and its importance, but there is still so much taboo and stigma surrounding mental illness -- especially complex disorders, like personality disorders, schizophrenia, dissociative disorders, eating disorders, etc etc.\n  \n  i wish it was more popular for people to actually read into the different mental health diagnoses and take the proper steps to support their friends and family who struggle with those issues.\n  ","402687":"\n  i'm fairly easy-going when it comes to romance, and i believe romance is more of a feeling than it is a place or an event. as long as you're emotionally intimate with someone, even the smallest instances can be romantic. i would be more than happy with an evening with my significant other where we have a candlelit dinner together and talk about everything going on in our lives.\n  ","402688":"\n  i've gone horseback riding in the catskill mountains, i suppose. i can't really think of anything else that would be considered adventurous.\n  ","402689":"\n  the coworker to whom i'm the closest is actually someone i was very wary of in the beginning, lmaoo. i honestly thought she was a b*tch and was very intimidating until we started talking regularly. now i feel comfortable telling her anything and we're super close.\n  ","402690":"\n  i'm proud of my boyfriend & close

etc etc., were considered taboo and\/or a sin.\n  ","402692":"\n  my friends and i used to drive around drunk & high and steal things from people's properties, including government property (traffic

together. addiction together. celebrations together. marriages together. all of the facets of growing into one's own and maturing were spent with one another, and for some people it doesn't work out, but by luck it worked out for us.\n  \n  every relationship is different, though. what works for one couple may not work for another. you just have to listen to your partner, your intuitions, and your own heart and go from there. it's difficult at times, and love definitely is not enough to continue moving forward.\n  ","402703":"\n  sneezed & farted at the same time while i was at work, lmaoo.\n

give purpose in my life and convinces me that there might be a reason for me to be alive.\n  ","402706":"\n  tbh, i've always felt really weird about sharing or lending my bed with others besides my significant other. i'm a private person for the most part, and i feel like it's a bit intrusive on my privacy for a person to be sleeping in my bed (i can't really explain it, it's weird).\n  \n

was displayed in one of the other rooms. i purchased two stickers from him.\n  ","403195":"\n  you don't even know me, so you have no merit in saying what i could or could not believe. if you keep enforcing your religious beliefs onto me, i'm going to ignore your messages.\n  ","403196":"\n  LOL.\n  \n  no, i don't believe in god & never have (even though i was raised in a religious household). i'm 27 years old, and my feelings on religion probably won't change at this rate. if anything, i relate more to eastern spiritualities than anything else.\n  ","403197":"\n  no, i'm an athiest.\n  ","403198":"\n  y'all should ask me questions, i'm bored af ~~\n  ","403199":"\n  yeah, i've done it with a few of my close friends when they were doing something borderline \"bad\" and i didn't want them to get in trouble, so i just played along until they were in the clear.\n  ","403200":"\n  yeah, it happened a few times in the past during my \"party\" stage.\n  ","403201":"\n  i have dozens of favorite books, lol.\n  \n  -- girl interrupted by susanna kaysen.\n  \n  -- american psycho by bret easton ellis.\n  \n  -- the shining by stephen king.\n  \n  -- the gargoyle by andrew davidson.\n  \n  -- the secret history by donna tartt.\n  \n  -- i am not a serial killer by dan wells.\n  ","403202":"\n  yeah, i was used to the galaxy s7 which i think only scanned it maybe once or twice. it always gave me an issue depending on which angle i would use my fingerprint to unlock my phone or sign into certain apps, and then it would lock me out if i didn't get it *just* right. it was aggravating.\n  \n  but the s10 is so much better, i'm really happy with the phone.\n  ","403203":"\n  there haven't been any issues with it at all, actually, even with the screen protector that i'm using. one thing i noticed that was different from the other galaxy phone i previously had was that the fingerprint scanner was *much* more comprehensive. instead of scanning your fingerprint once, it scanned it like 12 different times to pick up every groove. it was ridiculously interesting.\n  ","403204":"\n  i'm not much of a technology enthusiast at all, so no. i just got the samsung galaxy s10, though, and i absolutely love this phone. the camera is amazing.\n  ","403205":"\n  writing things down helps me a lot, because often it's difficult for me to express myself verbally. my words get jumbled up and i freeze up a lot -- it's hard for me to really convey what it is i'm thinking or feeling while i speak.\n  ","403206":"\n  i'm not much of a cook at all, but one of my favorite comfort foods is grilled cheese with tomato soup.\n  ","403207":"\n  it depends on how bad of a day i'm having, because it can range from being able for someone to cheer me up to me not being consolable at all. however, on the \"better\" days, my boyfriend usually cheers me up pretty well.\n  \n  as for material items that cheer me up, it helps my moods a lot when i listen to music, write something creatively, watch one of my favorite television shows, and\/or play video games.\n  ","403208":"\n  i like fragrances like lavender, chamomile, rose petals, jasmine, coconut, etc etc. i have a rose-scented shampoo and conditioner, and i think my body wash is scented with jasmine and coconut.\n  ","403209":"\n  yes, this basically defines my entire teenagehood. i was always interested in people who weren't interested in me back.\n  ","403210":"\n  chocolate isn't very good in my opinion, so most things are better than chocolate.\n  ","403211":"\n  i usually set a timer for everything. i have alarms that go off for when i wake up in the morning, for my laundry, etc etc.\n  ","403212":"\n  definitely in the fall. the heat of the fire can be too much during summer nights (at least where i live) but it's perfect for fall nights.\n  ","403213":"\n  no, probably not. they're probably just self conscious and are wondering why you're interested in them.\n  ","403214":"\n  thanks!!\n  \n  my day has been good so far. i finished up my work about an hour ago and i've been cleaning and tidying up the house since then.\n  ","403215":"\n  not the app, no. however, when i use it on the desktop it keeps redirecting to spam sites and it's super annoying.\n  ","403216":"\n  i haven't even thought about my birthday yet, lmaoo. i don't have any particular gifts in mind.\n  ","403217":"\n  yeah, i don't think i want to do a fancy color next since winter is coming up soon and i want something a bit darker. i was thinking about doing a chocolate brown balayage with mahogany tints.\n  ","403218":"\n  the last concert i went to was a radio concert series called \"not so silent night\" at the barclays center in brooklyn last december. they had such musicians as muse, florence and the machine, mike shinoda, AJR, death cab for cutie, and bastille. it was a lot of fun.\n  ","403219":"\n  right now, i'm answering questions and listening to music while taking a break from working. on the weekends, i work from home.\n  ","403220":"\n  the other night, i watched the movie saw (2004) because i found it on hulu. :')) it's one of my favorite movies.\n  ","403221":"\n  honestly, i try to think on it as much as possible and develop theories for as many outcomes as possible before diving into something and making that choice. while i appreciate change and embrace it, sometimes it can be terrifying and if a difficult choice comes with significant change, i don't know how it would affect me. i usually take a few days to think on it.\n  ","403222":"\n  the last time that i took a risk was yesterday, when i asked my HR manager about yearly pay raises. my two-year work anniversary was this week and i was curious about whether or not my company implements yearly reviews, and i was also hesitant to ask her because i didn't want to seem pushy.\n  \n  however, it did pan out well. she didn't seem bothered by the fact that i asked at all, and she said that she expects me to receive another review within the next 4-6 months based on merit and performance.\n  ","403223":"\n  well, if i told you my secrets then they wouldn't necessarily be secret anymore.\n  ","403224":"\n  thanks for the follow ~~\n  \n  i don't follow people upon request, so i won't be following you back. however, i hope you have a pleasant day.\n  ","403225":"\n  no, i don't have an issue with you. you may continue asking me question if you'd like, after all that's the purpose of askfm.\n  ","403226":"\n  no, that doesn't necessarily mean that they still have feelings for their ex. it could simply mean that they're not in the mood at that moment to talk about their ex, or they believe that you've already covered the subject so much in the past that there isn't anything left to discuss anymore.\n  ","403227":"\n  i've never had that question asked to me before, haha. i would try to redirect the answer to reflect how you *would* be a good candidate instead of answering the question outright. something like ...\n  \n  \"given my credentials and wealth of experience, my wish is that you may take my application and interview into consideration. i also want to thank you for this opportunity to sit down with you.\"\n  \n  and then follow up after the interview with an email that also thanks them for the opportunity and that you hope to hear from them soon.\n  ","403228":"\n  yeah, a few people in my life come to mind.\n  ","403229":"\n  for me personally, it wouldn't really warrant breaking up with someone. ideally the two people should have a serious conversation with each other about their feelings and come to a mutual understanding.\n  ","403230":"\n  i listen to pretty much all styles of music. and regardless, my depression has no correlation with the music i listen to. my depression is the result of both chemical imbalances and environmental factors while i was growing up.\n  ","403231":"\n  i had to google search what that was, lmaoo.\n  \n  no. i just have poor eyesight and astigmatism.\n  ","403232":"\n  depends entirely on the person. for some people it can be a happy occasion while for others, it can be depressing.\n  ","403233":"\n  my one roommate is a commercial truck driver and the other is a manager at a food store.\n  ","403234":"\n  i answered this once already, and my answer was no. you can't put a universal label on a group of people and expect them to all behave the same way. that's unrealistic.\n  ","403235":"\n  depends on the situation. having a college degree isn't a necessity and it doesn't necessarily mean you'll find a good job, but i would encourage everyone to challenge themselves and continually learn, whether they want to do that through college or taking up another endeavor.\n  \n  i don't think it's fair for a person to rely solely on the hope that their future spouse will provide for them, but if the case happens where your current spouse makes enough money to support the entire family then there's nothing wrong with staying home.\n  ","403236":"\n  neither. nobody should be the \"head\" of a household, there should be equality of responsibilities among everyone involved.\n  ","403237":"\n  of course not, lol. it's my close friend who i've known for 10 years and his brother.\n  ","403238":"\n  tonight, i'm seeing my friend perform at an open mic night at a nature preserve. there are going to be other performers rapping and doing spoken word poetry, and people will be promoting and selling their artwork !!\n  ","403239":"\n  no, like i said we're rarely home at the same time anyway.\n  ","403240":"\n  not at all. there's nothing to miss out on.\n  ","403241":"\n  no? i'm happy in my relationship. i wouldn't want to change it for the world.\n  ","403242":"\n  i'm not entirely sure. i don't know if i want children at all.\n  ","403243":"\n  they're LED lights, but they do come in bright colors. there are 16 color settings on the remote.\n  ","403244":"\n  yes !! i'm obsessed and so happy with the way it came out.\n  ","403245":"\n  no, that wouldn't be fair at all and i'm also not interested in her in that way anymore. my feelings for her stopped about a year after we broke up when i was 14 years old.\n  ","403246":"\n  lol, definitely not. we primarily broke up because she realized she was straight.\n  ","403247":"\n  well i've been with my current boyfriend for 10 years. prior to that, i was interested in another man. i've only been in three relationships.\n  ","403248":"\n  no, she was my first relationship and only relationship with a girl. ironically, she's currently my best friend.\n  ","403249":"\n  we were 13 years old, lmaoo.\n  ","403250":"\n  no, not at all. the only thing that was difficult was hiding our relationship from others because we weren't ready to come out yet publicly.\n  ","403251":"\n  well, i'm bisexual so yeah. i had a girlfriend in the past.\n  ","403252":"\n  no. heterosexual people definitely exist.\n  ","403253":"\n  i like listening to those live lo-fi hip hop beat videos on youtube as background noise (i.e. \"beats to sleep\/study to\").\n  ","403254":"\n  be considerate of other people's spaces, clean up after yourself, and be mindful of how your actions affect others (i.e. if someone is trying to sleep then try to be quieter).\n  ","403255":"\n  favorite color; earth tones.\n  \n  favorite

","403259":"\n  surprisingly, no. i don't really get phased or unsettled by anything at all. if anything, typically unsettling events intrigue me.\n  ","403260":"\n  i suppose it ultimately depends on what the gift or food is, lmaoo.\n  ","403261":"\n  for the most part, yes. they're not really strict rules or anything because we're all functional adults, and most of the time we're not even home at the same time.\n  ","403262":"\n  no, i don't believe so. however, my close friend baked me a housewarming cake last weekend to celebrate me moving into a new house. :'))\n  ","403263":"\n  if you've heard the songs, you would know that they're definitely not u.s. anthems, lmaoo. they're just two iconic songs with \"anthem\" in the title.\n  ","403264":"\n  leftovers are meals that are literally left over from a previous meal that you cooked.\n  ","403265":"\n  no, i've never watched the walking dead before. everyone tells me that i would love it, though.\n  ","403266":"\n  nothing is wrong with my shoes. i just don't entertain foot fetishists.\n  ","403267":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","403268":"\n  the clothes washer and dryer are in the basement, so the only purpose for the basement right now is to do laundry.\n  ","403269":"\n  because i like filters, obviously.\n  ","403270":"\n  lol, sorta? it's from the brand black craft cult.\n  ","403271":"\n  \"the anthem\" by good charlotte and \"national anthem\" by lana del rey, clearly.\n  ","403272":"\n  i suppose the last time i took a risk was last week when i moved out of my parents' house. it most definitely paid off, i haven't felt this relaxed and motivated and free in years.\n  ","403273":"\n  considering how important happiness is to me, i would rather be poor and happy.\n  ","403274":"\n  i'm fairly flexible and easy going.\n  ","403275":"\n  i've never written a song before.\n  ","403276":"\n  i'm sure there are some houses that don't have basements.\n  ","403277":"\n  when i finally got home after a long day yesterday. i was able to heat up dinner, take a shower, and relax in front of the television.\n  ","403278":"\n  if you're talking about my profile picture, it's a snapchat filter.\n

haven't gotten my hair cut since the last time i colored it months ago, lol. i do desperately need a shave, though.\n  ","403286":"\n  i absolutely love the colder weather, but i hate how there's such little daylight. i don't like driving at night so it raises my anxiety a lot.\n  ","403287":"\n  definitely not. i've always had horrendous attendance records.\n  ","403288":"\n  $0. i don't style my

was pretty warm out today. it's currently 60 degrees fahrenheit.\n  ","403294":"\n  i'm doing fine today. i just got out of work and now i'm waiting for my therapy appointment. when i get home, i'm

disorder (although i think it's in remission) so my anxiety levels are always sky high.\n  ","403298":"\n  no, i'm sometimes hypercritical of the things i read.\n  ","403299":"\n  it probably wouldn't be funnier, it would likely be just as funny. i love all of the nonsensical and ridiculous situations they get into, lmaoo.\n  ","403300":"\n  i'm waiting for my therapy appointment. i got here 30 minutes early, smh.\n  ","403301":"\n  unfortunately, yes. that's why i don't like sharing responsibilities with anyone. if i'm doing a project then it's a solo project.\n  ","403302":"\n  yeah, i'm very forgetful. :\/ i don't remember half of the events that happened in my life.\n  ","403303":"\n  i'm feeling fantastic tbh. moving out was the best thing i could do.\n  ","403304":"\n  waking up

seem to shake those feelings. it's really getting on my nerves and it was affecting me at work today, which is something that almost never happens to me because i'm a firm believer that you shouldn't take your personal problems to work with you.\n  ","403309":"\n  i googled the closest supermarket to my new house and found one like two miles away, lol.\n  ","403310":"\n  an iced tea at work this morning.\n  ","403311":"\n  i think it was 40 hours that i went without sleep when i was in high school.\n  ","403312":"\n  unfortunately, yes. it happens occasionally when i use askfm on the

punching my pillow while crying hysterically.\n  ","403315":"\n  this past weekend, i assembled the furniture for my bedroom, unpacked most of the things for the house, and i even had a friend over on saturday night. :'))\n  ","403316":"\n  i've always been the one with over-protective parents, lmaoo. all of my significant others' parents have been very understanding and easygoing.\n

yourself and the game. if you don't have any other responsibilities for the time being, then there's nothing wrong with playing video games for an extended period of time.\n  ","403319":"\n  i need to unpack and assemble the kitchen table for the house, as well as purchase some dining room chairs. i think i also need another lamp for my desk because my keyboard lights don't work anymore.\n

barber of fleet street, as well as the crow. :'))\n  ","403329":"\n  honestly, i would probably try to distance myself from them because it isn't fair for me to always be around when they need support but they're not reciprocating the same effort.\n  ","403330":"\n  my friend came over last night for dinner, and i started laughing hysterically at something she said. it was a lot of fun having her over.\n  ","403331":"\n  i only talk to my parents when it's on a need-to-know basis. i don't really have conversations with them.\n  ","403332":"\n  i don't have any sort of talismans or objects that

with both.\n  ","403334":"\n  i would rather feel fulfilled with love as opposed to having a lot of money but no one to share it with.\n  ","403335":"\n  i don't believe so, no. we're not close or

because some people are confused about their gender and it takes some experimentation before they come to know who they truly are. those sorts of situations don't take away from actual trans people, though.\n  ","403382":"\n  ???\n  \n  tbh... i like the taste of stale things better than fresh things sometimes, lmaoo.\n  ","403383":"\n  i don't believe i was ever friends with someone who could be considered a \"transtrender.\" that insinuates that being trans is, somehow, a fashion trend, and tbh that sort of mentality just makes life even harder for existing trans people.\n  ","403384":"\n  not at all, lol.\n  ","403385":"\n  no, there's unfortunately no cure for depression. depression may go into remission but it doesn't mean it's cured.\n  ","403386":"\n  tbh i'm feeling fantastic after moving out of my parents' house. i can actually live my life the way i want to live it without getting negativity or unwarranted comments from people such as my mother, and it feels nice to come home, sit down, and do whatever chores i need to do without someone prying into my life, bossing me around, and judging me.\n  ","403387":"\n  my pronouns are they\/them and i'm a non-binary person.\n  \n  i've always felt weird about my own gender, and i remember even from a very young age i didn't identify with being a girl or a woman. i was uneducated on trans identities because of the era, so people just basically called me a \"tomboy.\" i didn't learn about being non-binary or genderfluid until a few years ago, so ever since then i've tossed around a few labels that weren't within the gender binary to describe myself.\n  ","403388":"\n  i support greta !! she has a strong message and it's so important to be aware of climate change and the devastating effects we have on the environment.\n  ","403389":"\n  politics are interesting, but unfortunately i haven't kept up to date with what's been going on recently.\n  ","403390":"\n  i don't believe that i'm better than other people, lol. if anything, i'm constantly degrading myself because i have poor self-esteem and make terrible life choices.\n  ","403391":"\n  yeah, i seldom wear makeup to begin with.\n  ","403392":"\n  how so?\n  ","403393":"\n  it looks like the only person trying to be edgy here is you, lmaoo.\n  \n  grow up yourself -- another person's gender isn't any of your business so it's useless to occupy yourself with the happenings of others, especially total strangers, lol. instead of being twisted about my gender, perhaps you can channel that energy into something more productive.\n  ","403394":"\n  i don't have just one favorite movie, haha. i love the lord of the rings trilogy though (i'm actually watching the two towers rn).\n  ","403395":"\n  aw, thank you so much !! this is really sweet.\n  ","403396":"\n  why would they change?\n  ","403397":"\n  my name is leigh, and my pronouns are they\/them. some of my interests include mental health advocacy, writing, and music.\n  ","403398":"\n  me managing my life is akin to a fish jumping into a dry boat and flopping around in a constant, panicked state.\n  ","403399":"\n  i heard about it briefly, but i haven't done any research on it or looked into it at all. :\/ i feel terrible, i'm so out of the loop when it comes to current events and politics and whatnot.\n  ","403400":"\n  yes, i agree that friends can act more like family than one's own family. i'm much closer to my friends than i am to my actual family members.\n  ","403401":"\n  a few years ago, i paid around $250 for two tickets to a macklemore concert (they were around $100 each and then there were added fees).\n  ","403402":"\n  no, i don't think they're all bad people at all. i do believe most of them are uneducated, though.\n  ","403403":"\n  thanks !! it's actually a snapchat filter, haha.\n  ","403404":"\n  i've never watched the office before, actually.\n  ","403405":"\n  no, i don't have a garden.\n  ","403406":"\n  i think we may follow the same people, butttt ...\n  \n\n   @urlsareshittbh\n  \n\n\n   @origamibirds\n  \n\n\n   @speakofthefckindevil_\n  \n\n\n   @FreckleFaceDimpleCheek\n  \n\n\n   @daintybumblebee\n  \n\n\n   @LouisaRHale\n  \n","403407":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm non-binary. however, do you have a question?\n  ","403408":"\n  yes, i listen to my intuition fairly often because it's seldom wrong.\n  ","403409":"\n  \"it was good, very busy. how was yours?\"\n  \n  he had asked me how my day went because we didn't talk for the entire day up until an hour ago or so.\n  ","403410":"\n  one of my short-term goals is to build the furniture i purchased for my room, haha. i'm hoping to have that done this weekend.\n  ","403411":"\n  yes, i love sushi. my favorites are spicy tuna rolls and salmon avocado rolls.\n  ","403412":"\n  depends on the partner. i wouldn't consider it a red flag really, for me it's normal for my boyfriend and i not to text for most of the day because we're both too busy with work. sometimes a simple \"hey\" isn't doable.\n  ","403413":"\n  it's great !! i'm so happy with it, i just need to build a few things of furniture, get rid of the moving boxes, and go grocery shopping, lmaoo.\n  ","403414":"\n  not very often at all. perhaps once a month or so.\n  ","403415":"\n  strangely enough, i've never heard any gossip about myself. i don't even think people gossiped about me when i was in high school, but i honestly can't remember for certain.\n  ","403416":"\n  one of my passions is mental health awareness. i firmly believe it's important to try to erase the stigma associated with mental illnesses as well as promote better treatment options and accessibility.\n  \n  my hobbies are writing, reading, playing video games, watching television, photography, art, and seeing my friends.\n  ","403417":"\n  i suppose my commitment and loyalty to my friends. i'll walk to the end of the earth for them.\n  ","403418":"\n  worst as in just ... bad, stupid, not scary at all.\n  ","403419":"\n  i have four pillows on my new bed, lmaoo.\n  ","403420":"\n  my new beddddd. ?\n  ","403421":"\n  aw, thank you !!\n  ","403422":"\n  no, i can't remember the last time i took a vacation.\n  ","403423":"\n  well yeah, i'm moving out of my parents' house.\n  ","403424":"\n  10 years, lol.\n  ","403425":"\n  i'm doing well !! today is moving day, so i'm waiting for my friend to pick up the house keys and bring his moving truck to my house so we can begin loading up my boxes. :'))\n  ","403426":"\n  yeah, i'm in a relationship.\n  ","403427":"\n  i don't think that's necessarily bad, but i do believe it's important to obtain your news from multiple sources instead of just one source.\n  ","403428":"\n  i remember watching dead silence (2007) when i was in high school & thinking it was absolutely terrible, lmaoo.\n  ","403429":"\n  my stomach, my jawline, my mouth, my thighs, my upper arms ... the list goes on and on.\n  ","403430":"\n  i always skip youtube ads, they're usually pointless and a waste of my time.\n  ","403431":"\n  depends on why you're going to montauk. i personally love it there, it's so relaxing and i love the brewery.\n  ","403432":"\n  tonight's sunset. ?\n  ","403433":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","403434":"\n  depends on the context and who the person is.\n  ","403435":"\n  yes, i'm pretty sure all parts of new york have four distinct seasons. i'm sure upstate new york is much colder with more severe winters, though.\n  ","403436":"\n  if this is referring to street car, then i have no idea. it's been eons since i read the play and\/or seen the movie.\n  ","403437":"\n  does sin city count? haha.\n  \n  i also liked a streetcar named desire when i watched it years ago.\n  ","403438":"\n  attitude matters the most in the long run. having money and good looks is nice, but it's superficial -- it won't matter in weeks or months from now, but a person's attitude will most definitely matter.\n  ","403439":"\n  i haven't yet, but i want to watch it *so* badly !!\n  ","403440":"\n  finally done packing (except for my television and a few small items). i have extra clothes hanging but i'll have to make a second trip and come back for them because i don't have enough room in my suitcase for them. ?\n  \n  my room looks so empty, aaaahhh. but i'm so excited to build up a brand new bedroom. :'))\n  ","403441":"\n  about an hour apart, give or take. ?\n  ","403442":"\n  ah, i thoroughly enjoy a mid-afternoon session of disgusting others.\n  \n  the more upset you become at my existence, the more powerful i become. so please, indulge and feed me.\n  ","403443":"\n  lmaoo. ignorance is widespread across the world too, evidently.\n  ","403444":"\n  ???\n  \n  weird flex, but okay.\n  ","403445":"\n  opinions cannot be unwell, lol. regardless, i don't really see the point in telling me this. your opinion on my opinions isn't going to change how i think.\n  ","403446":"\n  i'm mentally ill, but that doesn't mean i don't have inner strength. most mentally ill people are, in fact, very strong individuals.\n  ","403447":"\n  i don't believe so.\n  "}}
