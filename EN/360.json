after seeing a doctor and they decided that they weren't dangerous to themself.\n  \n  is this ... valid? i was under the impression that cases like this, there's a holding period of like 24-48 hours

ridiculous.\n  \n  i wrote a very long, 5-paragraph long, email to my HR manager addressing my concerns and questions regarding the entire ordeal. she never responded to me. but i hope she heeds my

including going back to the office, and the other three are literally ridiculous), and said that if we don't choose an option, we'll have to resign.\n  \n  my department has around 30 people in a very small space. there's no air flow, the air quality is awful, there are no windows, and the space is very cramped. i can literally reach out my arm and touch my coworker on the shoulder. what they're

new york on vacation, i find it's best to leave my phone in the hotel room while i go travel with whoever i'm with, and it brings a certain sense of adventure wherever i go. i live more in the moment

therapist asked me if i had ever done any \"inner child healing\" exercises. i didn't even know what that was, so she asked me if i would be willing to try it, so i said yes.\n  \n  basically, she had me do deep breathing exercises while my eyes were closed and she spoke to me, guiding me through a scenario where i was in a park and i found a bench with a person sitting on it. she then said it was me as a child, and she asked me how old my child version was who was sitting on the bench. i said they were 7 years old. my therapist guided me through sitting down next to the child version of myself and told me to think about how the conversation would go, and that i could stand up and walk away when i was ready.\n  \n  in my mind, i had asked the child version of myself how they got there and how they were feeling. but the child didn't respond or even make eye contact with me. after i \"came out\" of the exercise, i told that to my therapist and she said that it would make sense that as a child, knowing what ab*se i went through, i wouldn't want to make eye contact with people. and i informed her that i still don't even do that now.\n  \n  it was weird, but interesting. apparently we're going to revisit it every once in a while and see what happens. i'm not necessarily sure i believe in it exactly, but i'm open minded to it.\n  ","386719":"\n  i guess work? idk, nothing really

finished. that way by the time the weekend comes, i don't have any pressing responsibilities.\n  \n  on the weekends, i'll wake up at whatever time i get up naturally, have breakfast, drink some coffee or gfuel, and usually i'll log into social media on my laptop and catch up on things while listening to music. sometimes i'll play video games in the afternoon as well.\n  ","386722":"\n  idk,

high school, but it was a mandatory part of the curriculum.\n  ","386725":"\n  oh goodness, i'm sorry you're dealing with that. she might not even realize she's being hard on you like that, which is concerning in itself.\n  \n  have you tried to simply talk to her about it in a mature, conversational manner? if she's aware of what she's doing now, she might be apt to re-think her words and not say those things anymore.\n  ","386726":"\n  my addiction to self-h*rm when i was a teenager. i wouldn't have started in the first place.\n  ","386727":"\n  that doesn't necessarily mean that she

as if i thought you were. it just reminded me of those instances where people do romanticize it or think any good comes from having mental illness.\n  \n  even certain things that aren't necessarily romanticizing can leave a bad taste in my mouth, tbh. like when people say \"yeah my x disorder makes me feel more deeply for people and the things i love,\" which is ... fine on a surface level, i suppose. but it's also just as damaging because that's very much a symptom too, and a lot of harm can come of it due to personal attachments and whatnot.\n  ","386995":"\n  i usually hang out with the same 3-4 people, haha. i don't have a large inner circle, but i'm content with the friends i have.\n  ","386996":"\n  for me personally, i would it consider it extreme if someone is using their religion to enforce harm onto someone else, i.e. someone's who's christian and is protesting saying that gay or trans people should d*e, and other things of that nature.\n  ","386997":"\n  i never said i disagreed with you regarding islam. i was offering christianity as an example of another flawed religion. perhaps it's just where i live (who knows?), but there are a lot of christians\/catholics\/etc etc. who are extreme in their thinking, and leverage their religious beliefs to put forth their own close-minded views.\n  ","386998":"\n  the answer depends entirely on the individual. some people find meaning in their careers, others in their friends and families, and others in their spiritual and\/or religious beliefs. a lot of the time, it's a combination of some or all of those factors.\n  ","386999":"\n  don't believe everything you read online, triple check your sources to see that you're obtaining the most unbiased information, and don't take social media

extremes.\n  ","387002":"\n  i think it depends on the individual circumstance. personally, i'd much rather know things than be ignorant or na\u00efve towards them, even if it might hurt me.\n  ","387003":"\n  i wouldn't say that my day was necessarily good, but it wasn't bad either. i feel much more stable today than i did yesterday, for which i'm thankful.\n  \n  yesterday, i had a meltdown and couldn't stop crying while trying to work in the morning, and i ended up clocking out around noon. i laid in bed for an hour before finally taking a 3-hour nap, and i woke up feeling even worse than before. i haven't been that down in a very long time, but i'm feeling a bit better today.\n  ","387004":"\n  ???\n  \n  this is exactly what i'm talking about, rofl.\n  ","387005":"\n  i don't think it's wrong to say that, no. *all* major religions are extremely problematic because of their historical roots and context, and islam is no different.\n  \n  i'm not saying i'm an expert on religion or anything, i haven't studied religion in over a decade, but i just want to point out that i'm not targeting just islam when it comes to things like this. there are also major issues with christianity too, as an example.\n  ","387006":"\n  i don't have any thoughts on the matter. people have the freedom to be spiritual and\/or religious, and it isn't my business what someone else believes in.\n  ","387007":"\n  OH, okay. you weren't patronizing, i just read the message wrong and it sounded like you wanted me to cut my medication and therapy out of my life, lmaoo.\n  \n  eating healthy food and exercising can temporarily help to some degree, but it isn't a cure-all. the mental illness will still be there and most of the time, the most effective means of combatting it is through psychiatric medication and talk therapy.\n  ","387008":"\n  as much as it frustrates me that the stigma exists, i still try to talk about mental health and mental illness often *because* that stigma is still there. i want people to understand that while everyone has mental health, not everyone struggles with mental illness, and you can't compare a small bout of sadness to chronic depression.\n  ","387009":"\n  when i first started working, i was a minimum wage cashier at a drug store. i worked in that position for a while before being promoted a few times, but i stayed with the drug store for 4 years.\n  ","387010":"\n  no, i'm not a religious person.\n  ","387011":"\n  i'm not really concerned with having romantic relationships at the moment, so it isn't something that's in the forefront of my mind.\n  ","387012":"\n  i haven't watched it and i'm definitely not planning on watching it. i stumbled upon a small clip of one of the scenes on twitter that auto-played while i was scrolling, and it was *so* wrong and disgusting. i can't imagine actually sitting through an entire movie of that.\n  ","387013":"\n  i really hope you're not suggesting that i stop taking medication or going to therapy in favor of eating well and exercising.\n  ","387014":"\n  if my medication and therapy sessions weren't effective, then i wouldn't have been taking them for nearly four years, lol. if i didn't have these things in my life and if i didn't seek professional treatment when i was 25, then i would be dead.\n  ","387015":"\n  i wrote an essay a few years ago regarding my experiences with depression and people who have romanticized it over the years because i was so frustrated with how quick others are to be like, \"yeah at least you learned x out of it!\"\n  \n  no -- i didn't learn anything from being depressed, s*icidal, and hurting myself for nearly a decade. i was in pain and wanted to d*e, and there's nothing redeeming or beautiful about that.\n  ","387016":"\n  i think it's appalling for so many different reasons, i wouldn't be able to even list them all. not only is the actual filming and production of the movie problematic because they're children (and tbh, those parents should be condemned too for subjecting those children to this), but the actual movie will only teach children that these types of behaviors are okay, that they'll continue to be s*xualized, and and will gain positive responses from being s*xualized. the idea of consent is lost, and that's very troubling.\n  ","387017":"\n  no, i've been taking medication and going to weekly therapy sessions to handle my mental illnesses. they work for the most part, it's just environmental things around me that trigger my more \"extreme\" responses.\n  ","387018":"\n  at this point, i just want to live independently by myself (most likely in an apartment, i don't need anything grand), adopt a lot of animals, progress forward in my career, get a better handle on my mental health, and write a book.\n  ","387019":"\n  no, lol. my life would be 100x easier if i wasn't mentally ill. there are no redeeming \"qualities\" to having a mental illness, the symptoms are ever-present and have absolutely wrecked havoc on me and my life.\n  ","387020":"\n  my psychiatrist sees patients on sundays.\n  ","387021":"\n  when everything first started happening, i was coping very poorly with COVID. i was terrified that i was going to catch it, or my family or friends were going to catch it, so i took the protocol very seriously and it also affected my mental health in light of my paranoia and anxiety. i started working from home mid-march, and i'm still working from home now in september.\n  \n  now that it's been several months and things seem to be getting better COVID-wise, my worry about the virus has lessened, but my mental health is still on the decline.\n  ","387022":"\n  tomorrow, i'm planning on running a few errands during the day before relaxing in the afternoon\/evening. then on sunday, i have a doctor's appointment.\n  ","387023":"\n  i don't like swimming pools in general, they sorta freak me out because i can't imagine how much bacteria is circulating in them. dozens upon dozens of people use swimming pools every day (public ones, at least), the idea makes me uncomfortable.\n  ","387024":"\n  yes, i absolutely adore the cold weather !! i prefer it over warm or hot weather.\n  ","387025":"\n  i haven't been to many places at all, even within the united states. therefore, i don't have a basis upon which i can make a decision. i would have to visit more places to come to a real conclusion.\n  ","387026":"\n  idk, i'm pretty desensitized to most things. i suppose one of the more common things that can make me cringe is the thought of having your fingernails ripped off.\n  ","387027":"\n  i've never tried a fruit that i absolutely *hated*, but i don't really like pineapple very much.\n  ","387028":"\n  i believe that's a pretty cynical way to look at it, but nevertheless, we have been taught things from a very young age that does skew the truth (united states history, for example). that doesn't really mean your entire existence is a lie, but i can see where the perspective comes from.\n  ","387029":"\n  i don't believe i have, actually !! i just typically order food from a restaurant specializing in whichever cuisine i want, i've never been to a fusion restaurant before.\n  ","387030":"\n  of course -- evolution is scientifically accurate, and students should know the science behind evolution (even if they attend a religious school, because i believe the science should also be taught alongside the religious belief).\n  ","387031":"\n  i'm not picky with my pizza, so just cheese and sometimes pepperoni is fine by me. i just actually ate a slice of cold pizza for dinner, rofl.\n  ","387032":"\n  i left the house a few nights ago to pick up some things at 7-11 (i wanted drinks and munchie food). i'm going out again tomorrow to grab some toilet paper and other household necessities.\n  \n  my area is still following quarantine guidelines, i.e. wearing a mask in stores, restaurants are only allowing a certain percentage of patrons in at a time, schools are beginning to open but are closing abruptly because of cases, etc etc.\n  ","387033":"\n  i have zero idea what

self-care have been playing video games, journaling, sleeping, smoking weed, and drinking alcohol (granted the last two aren't healthy, but whatever).\n  ","387050":"\n  i'm open about it to close friends and i've talked about it on my social media accounts, but i never brought it up at work before. some of my coworkers know (including my supervisor), but i never felt the need to bring it up to management or anything.\n  ","387051":"\n  eh, not really. i knew i wanted to go into writing, but there are several different industries where writing is prevalent. i took a lot of psychology and sociology courses, so for a split second, i debated on going into research. however, i graduated college with a bachelor's degree in communications, so i could apply my skills in virtually any industry. i just happened to find a job first in the legal field, and then now, in the publishing field.\n  ","387052":"\n  yes, i consider that one of my greatest assets. even though my mental health sometimes gets in the way of my ability to work, i do have a strong work ethic and have always established myself as a top person regardless of which job i've had.\n  ","387053":"\n  i usually play as

friends, my inbox is nearly empty so i'd appreciate some questions. it'll also help distract me from my negative feelings ~~\n  ","387056":"\n  i believe in souls to a certain extent, yes. i've seen lifelessness where the object doesn't appear to have a soul anymore, and it's crushing to realize. i also believe that when we die, our body may perish but our souls carry on, as our souls are created from energy and energy cannot be destroyed.\n  ","387057":"\n  i'm not really sure how to answer this questions besides to state the obvious -- you *should* be good to most people, as long as they didn't warrant something bad happening to them (which i admit is subjective, but it is what it is).\n  ","387058":"\n  this has been asked to me so many times that i'm beginning to think it's a fetish.\n  ","387059":"\n  i don't tend to screw up royally, but i do make mistakes here and there that i try to amend immediately so that other people don't notice (especially regarding work, lol).\n  ","387060":"\n  honestly, terrible. i feel horrible right now, and it's been like this since around 9:30am (so around 9 hours). i was crying the entire morning and couldn't focus on my work, so i clocked out at noon and cried in bed for an hour before finally being able to fall asleep. i slept for three hours and had a nostalgic dream about my ex, which made me feel even worse when i woke up.\n  \n  my roommate came home shortly thereafter, and we talked for a bit and he told me that our friend who admitted themselves to the hospital is getting out tomorrow, and they're coming over tomorrow afternoon. so i'm looking forward to talking to them and seeing how they feel.\n  \n  i'm drinking disaronno right now, and i'm debating on either trying to write something creatively or play video games.\n  ","387061":"\n  (cont) ... In conclusion, BPD sucks lmao. I'm religious so the only thing I've been able to rly do is pray to God to let his will be done & allow me to feel at peace with the outcome, but the situation still makes me incredibly anxious bc I can't cope with the thought of us never speaking again.\n  \n  --\n  \n  i understand, and no need to thank me -- i'm here if you or anyone else needs to talk, and i'm happy to provide my support and opinion. you're in a difficult situation no doubt, and i understand the BPD part of it (although honestly, i think my therapist is leaning more towards bipolar disorder at this point, idk what's going on). i'm also attached to my ex to the point where idk what i would do if he wasn't in my life at all, i can't imagine a life without him even in a friend context.\n  ","387062":"\n  ugh, i feel this hardcore. :\/ i'm attached to my close friend, and surprisingly enough, my supervisor. and i'm still somewhat attached to my ex, but i guess my feelings are a lot stronger than i initially thought because i keep having dreams about him. ugh.\n  \n  you shouldn't let your loneliness lead you into an uncomfortable place, though. i know it's difficult, but try to compartmentalize your feelings and understand that this friendship\/relationship shouldn't supplement your loneliness, especially if you don't think your feelings other than the attachment will go anywhere. you need to preserve your own happiness first and foremost.\n  ","387063":"\n  you're not dumb for feeling the way that you're feeling. i understand the confusion and your worry that you're going to get hurt. i suppose my advice would be to take each day as it comes and try not to focus heavily on the future, because like he said, the future is unpredictable -- and that can go both ways.\n  ","387064":"\n  i mean, technically it's legal but i think it's a bit odd considering both people are in *very* different stages of their lives. i can't imagine there being any common factors involved besides surface-level interests and whatnot.\n  ","387065":"\n  (cont) ... In common. In my heart, I feel we won't end up together. Still, I'm EXTREMELY attached due to BPD & when we didn't talk before, I was miserable & obsessing over him. What do you think I should do? I feel like this is torture lol.\n  \n  --\n  \n  i'm sorry you're going through this. i mean ... personally, if i thought something was going nowhere with someone, i would cut them out. but i understand the feeling of attachment because i'm currently very much attached to a close friend of mine (not the same thing, but still), and i could never imagine them not being in my life.\n  \n  is there any way you can be honest with them about these feelings you're having, both the negative and positive ones? it might provide you with a sense of direction and some closure.\n  ","387066":"\n

oblivion.\n  ","387077":"\n  just tell them straight out and don't try to beat around the bush or sugarcoat it. people appreciate honesty when it comes to those types of things, and it's easier on

ahah. i also like parcheesi when it comes to board games.\n  ","387117":"\n  i mean ... it's a weird circumstance, but i'm sure plenty of people have done it before with no issue. i can imagine that as long as the ex is okay and on good terms with both people, there wouldn't be much wrong with it.\n  ","387118":"\n  i'm watching the new season of ancient aliens that just came out on netflix, i'm drinking a delicious beer, my window is open and the cold air is flowing in, and i'm overall in a content mood despite all of the chaos going on rn.\n  ","387119":"\n  i'm pretty sure there aren't any restaurants in my town that can give a romantic dinner, rofl.\n  ","387120":"\n  i usually just cut those people out of my life, tbh.\n  ","387121":"\n  i watch netflix pretty often, and i haven't had

but it really hurt my bank account. rofl.\n  ","387124":"\n  i've honestly just been working a lot, and in my spare time, i've been playing video games and trying to do some art (photography and drawing).\n  \n  i also started smoking weed at night to quell my anxiety, decrease my drinking habits, and aid in my sleep. it's been working pretty well so far.\n  ","387125":"\n  i went to the courts and talked to a judge, and she knocked it down to zero points on my license. however, i had to pay a $500 fine.\n  ","387126":"\n  i had a really frustrating\/emotional day. my work computer was having technical difficulties this morning, which caused me to not work for over an hour because the IT department was trying to figure out the problem. the problem wasn't even fixed, and the hard drive might have to be replaced. sigh.\n  \n  i also found out that a close friend of mine admitted themselves to the hospital for s*icidal ideation, and i feel so helpless. i just hope the hospital helps them, because i've heard a lot of stories of people going to that particular hospital here and leaving worse off than they started.\n  ","387127":"\n  i enjoy reading. however, i haven't really had the attention span to actually finish a book lately. i've tried reading three books over the past few months, and i haven't finished any of them.\n  ","387128":"\n  i'm sure i did, but i can't remember for the life of me what it was about.\n  ","387129":"\n  i worked from 9:00am to 5:30pm, and then i was talking to my roommate for a little while. i just took my meds, turned on the television, and grabbed a beer.\n  ","387130":"\n  i would personally confront the problem with a manager\/supervisor, but that's just me. however, if it's a very hostile work environment which is deterring you from enjoying your job, perhaps it's time to find a new job.\n  ","387131":"\n  yeah, it was a hefty one because i was going 20 mph over the speed limit. lmao.\n  ","387132":"\n  no, i'm

a new relationship right now.\n  ","387134":"\n  you're allowed to keep working here as long as it's under a certain amount salary-wise. a lot of people retire and act as a consultant for whatever industry they're in for extra money while still getting their retirement benefits.\n  ","387135":"\n  from my understanding, people who choose to retire can obtain social security benefits for retirement depending on how long they worked and the \"credits\" they've accrued over the years (it also depends on how much money you've made throughout your career).\n  \n  the average age of retirement for people in the united states is around 65 years old, but people can choose to retire earlier or later than that.\n  ","387136":"\n  not at all.\n  ","387137":"\n  oh goodness. lmao.\n

stigma surrounding toxic masculinity and men's mental health, meaning that men are conditioned to not express or feel emotion, be more violent, etc etc., and in turn that makes underlying mental illnesses go unnoticed (which is why more men die from s*icide).\n  ","387168":"\n  one single quality in a person isn't enough for me to love them. it has to be a combination of qualities, how well

honestly, in most cases i support vigilante justice. the justice system (in the united states) is absolutely horrid and doesn't protect victims and survivors, and sometimes people do take matters into their own hands to serve justice for themselves and the ones they love. i see nothing wrong with that.\n  ","387172":"\n  drinking wine when i'm sad, expecting it to make me feel better, but it only leads to mental breakdowns and crying fits. lmaoo.\n  ","387173":"\n  no, i've never been interested in the final fantasy series. i have a lot of friends and coworkers who love it, though.\n

dire the situations are. look at the widespread fires in the united states, south america, and africa -- these are all culprits of global warming to a certain extent, and it's absolutely horrifying. weather patterns are getting more and more severe throughout the year as well.\n  ","387176":"\n  i never have before, but i'm very interested in trying it !!\n  ","387177":"\n  thank you !! i appreciate it.\n  ","387178":"\n  i don't believe it's being taken seriously enough in the united states, which is why cases are constantly rising\/fluctuating depending on where you live. once some restaurants and bars started opening, people flocked to them and pretended like everything was back to \"normal\" again, when that is far from the truth.\n  \n  i do my due diligence by wearing a mask, social distancing, washing my hands often, staying home and isolating, etc etc.\n  ","387179":"\n  well yeah, otherwise i would go into more detail about the problems, lol. i've always been open about the ab*se but i keep most of the details to myself.\n  ","387180":"\n  most of 2020 has been a blur to me, honestly. the only good things really to come out of the year thus far is starting therapy again and being able to work from home.\n  \n  other than that, my mental health has been on the decline since the year started (probably due to COVID and all of the chaos going on the world, plus problems in my own life). my moods are sporadic and spontaneous, and i recently came down from a week-long manic episode. now i'm fairly sad most nights unless i'm high.\n  ","387181":"\n  yes, there are plenty of issues within my family.\n  ","387182":"\n  my weekend wasn't bad at all. i didn't do much on saturday at all from what i can remember besides getting very drunk and high (lmao), but sunday i went out to eat brunch with my roommate which was fun.\n  ","387183":"\n  i like both of them, it all depends on where you're trying to order from.\n  ","387184":"\n  i'd probably watch the movie first and then attempt at reading the book. i haven't had the attention span to really read an entire book lately, though.\n  ","387185":"\n  i've only ever seen the movie \"the parasite,\" but i enjoyed it a lot.\n  ","387186":"\n  i try to keep my bedroom as clean as possible. it's beneficial for my mental health when everything is organized and there's space for me to move around and breathe.\n  ","387187":"\n  most of the time, yes. i usually try to get 6-8 hours of sleep per night.\n  ","387188":"\n  yeah, i've dealt with a lot of harassment on askfm -- i just delete the messages at this point, i barely entertain them anymore.\n  \n  askfm is honestly terrible at their reporting\/blocking system, despite multiple complaints from users who are being harassed on this site. i don't think they'll improve their security measures anytime soon.\n  ","387189":"\n  i'm not quite sure what you mean by this.\n  ","387190":"\n  i oppose the death penalty. i think it's archaic and inhumane, and sorta an easy way out of a crime. it would be much more effective to throw someone in solitary confinement for the rest of their life, make them suffer.\n  ","387191":"\n  yes, i wholeheartedly agree with you. i know several people whose computers\/phones should be IP blocked because they constantly make new pages even after being banned solely to harass other users.\n  \n  however, IP bans can only do so much, and there are easy ways to get around them unfortunately.\n  ","387192":"\n  i like the aspect of being asked questions and answering them in the hopes that i'll either bring something to light for someone or educate them (depending on the question, obviously). i also like reading my friends' answers and learning more about them.\n  ","387193":"\n  mental health, writing, video games, music, movies\/television, and the arts.\n  ","387194":"\n  my family and i aren't on the best of terms. which doesn't bother me at all tbh, i would much rather them be out of my life completely at this point.\n  ","387195":"\n  this is going to sound weird, but my next therapy appointment. she and i have been making a lot of progress lately, and our session last night was very eye-opening and validating to me. she brought up the fact that i dissociate a lot without me even mentioning it first, just based on what i've told her about my memory lapses and memory loss of when i was a child.\n  ","387196":"\n  no, i'm single.\n  ","387197":"\n  definitely not, LOL. i've never had a good relationship with my family.\n  ","387198":"\n  i don't have the disposable income to donate to charities.\n  ","387199":"\n  no, i've never been interested in the social work profession. i'm not exactly a people person.\n  ","387200":"\n  linkin park is probably my overall favorite band.\n  \n  these days, i've also been listening to two feet, grandson, NF, mike shinoda,  juice WRLD, ashnikko, watsky, starset, and korn.\n  ","387201":"\n  i wouldn't necessarily say that i'm a workaholic, but i take my job very seriously. i don't usually work extra hours outside of my 40 hours per week, though.\n  ","387202":"\n  there are plenty of fake people all over the place. if i figure out that someone is not being genuine, then i'm not interested in talking to them and i wind up ignoring them.\n  ","387203":"\n  no, i have no desire to have someone else pay for things i purchase online. i have my own income.\n  ","387204":"\n  i love doing the dishes and doing laundry, haha. i don't mind vacuuming, it's just that my household has this super heavy-duty vacuum that's hard for me to navigate and it hurts my back.\n  \n  the chore i hate the most is cleaning the bathroom. :\/ especially the bathtub, it hurts my knees so much.\n  ","387205":"\n  i tell them directly, i do things for them (i.e. buying them things randomly, sending them memes that remind me of them, etc etc), and i try my best to be a good friend and talk on a regular basis.\n  ","387206":"\n  both, haha. i like setting tasks and deadlines for myself, but obviously money is extremely important in my life and i need a paycheck to survive.\n  ","387207":"\n  i miss the aspect of learning and going to lectures, but i don't miss school itself (if that makes sense). i like continuous learning, and sometimes i get the desire to enroll in a few classes at the local community college just for the hell of it.\n  ","387208":"\n  no, i don't believe in destiny.\n  ","387209":"\n  criminal minds !! i haven't even seen the entire show yet, but i always love restarting it from the beginning for nostalgic purposes and watching it season to season.\n  ","387210":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm doing well. i finished up with work, ate a delicious dinner, went to 7-11 to buy some drinks, and now i'm drinking a mike's harder lemonade. :'))\n  ","387211":"\n  i'm not quite sure i understand the question.\n  ","387212":"\n  in most cases, yes. there are certain circumstances where honesty may not work out well, though -- at least in the time being. it really depends on the individual situation.\n  ","387213":"\n  both simultaneously, in a sense. i look inward into the present moment more often than ever these days, but i'm also moving towards the future. at the same time, however, i do live somewhat in my past because of my therapy sessions and working through unresolved trauma.\n  ","387214":"\n  anons just use it as an excuse to try to ask people sexual questions.\n  ","387215":"\n  no, i don't.\n  ","387216":"\n  work, especially when assignments\/projects pile up on top of each other.\n  ","387217":"\n  yes !! it's currently 60 degrees fahrenheit outside & i'm living for it. i love the cooler weather sm.\n  \n  i don't do anything different during the autumn months, but i try to spend more time outside.\n  ","387218":"\n  i have a lot old old friends, so you'll have to be more specific.\n  ","387219":"\n  yeah, i've used doordash and grubhub.\n  ","387220":"\n  nah, i'd just be a bat. :'))\n  ","387221":"\n  do i look like a historian to you.\n  ","387222":"\n  you can like someone romantically, but the actual word \"crush\" is a bit juvenile.\n  ","387223":"\n  i wouldn't say most likely. there are a lot of factors that are involved in the diagnosis of a personality disorder. what you said could even be just a natural personality trait for someone.\n

violence is encouraged and instilled in men from a young age, when that isn't the case for most women.\n  ","387236":"\n  yeah, i just like regular cheese or pepperoni pizza.\n  ","387237":"\n  i have memory loss. not even just from childhood, but also from a day to day basis. i have to write things down constantly. and my therapist brought up the point that i'm likely experiencing a lot of dissociation (which i already kinda knew, but could never put the words to it).\n  \n  either way, she's the first professional to ever bring that to light with me. no one else has acknowledged it before. and it feels nice to be heard in that respect, because i feel like dissociation isn't really talked about enough in mental health circles.\n  ","387238":"\n  i prefer working in the mornings so that i have the afternoons\/evenings to myself to relax.\n  ","387239":"\n  it was good \u2014 very productive. i had work and then my therapy session, which raised a lot of questions and answers. my therapist brought up some interesting perspectives and actually validated one of the concerns i've experienced for years, which is the first time a professional has ever addressed this concern in the 3-4 years i've been in mental health treatment.\n  \n  i just finished writing in my journal, and now i'm going to open a beer and watch some television.\n  ","387240":"\n  yeah, if i order a

have zero hand-eye coordination.\n  ","387248":"\n  not really, no. restaurants and gyms can only seat 30-50% capacity (i think) and we still have to wear masks everywhere. most places are open now,

past 20 minutes.\n  \n  sorry, can't come back to work. there's a giant kitty preventing me from getting up.\n  ","387253":"\n  thank you!!\n  \n  so far, my monday has been filled with technical difficulties, fixing spreadsheets, and correcting mistakes in other people's work. so i have a slight headache, but at least i've kept busy.\n  ","387254":"\n  true !! i was afraid to play after a while because i'd constantly get hit in the fingers with the puck, lmfao.\n  ","387255":"\n  the only arcade game i really played was pinball. i also liked air hockey, but idk if that's classified as an arcade game.\n  ","387256":"\n  if i didn't have work or anything to do throughout the day, it'd probably be difficult for me not to check my phone because of the abundance of free time i'd have.\n  \n  i could probably do it if i wanted to, but i'd need other activities to occupy myself with for the entire day, lol.\n  ","387257":"\n  i'll be one to admit that i know pretty much nothing about politics in other countries.\n  ","387258":"\n  depends on which ex, haha. there's only one ex who i'd refuse to meet up with. my other two exes are good friends of mine.\n  ","387259":"\n  honestly, i feel the same way, lol. i was expecting something like alcohol or drugs ... not meditation.\n  \n  i'm not really going to entertain this anymore. people are always trying to make problems out of nothing and call it something more serious than it actually is.\n  ","387260":"\n  i already told you. you can also google it.\n  ","387261":"\n  i'm not sure if meditation can be classified as an addiction.\n  ","387262":"\n  yes, i wholeheartedly agree. it definitely calms me down when i'm stressed at work, ahah.\n  ","387263":"\n  me too !! i have spotify playlists for everything from skyrim and oblivion to the halo franchise and destiny 1 & 2, to the LOTR and harry potter, and i also have a game of thrones playlist. :'))\n  ","387264":"\n  depends on my mood. lately i've been listening to a lot of instrumental music (i.e. video game, movie, and television soundtracks), alternative rock, nu metal, pop, and rap.\n  ","387265":"\n  i just told you how.\n  ","387266":"\n  addictions can kill you. if you're not ready to seek help, then that's perfectly okay. but any kind of addiction is harmful for you both mentally and physically, and it also harms your relationships with friends, family, partners, etc etc.\n  \n  it can make you happy in the short term, but in the long term, it's extremely harmful and it's only an instant gratification.\n  ","387267":"\n  my roommate picked me up a vape pen the last time he traveled out of state, haha. idk if that counts though, i didn't ask for it or anything so he surprised me with it.\n  ","387268":"\n  stopping an addiction is difficult, and usually it's easier if you have a support system and medical intervention, such as a therapist or a psychiatrist who can help you ease off of whatever you're addicted to.\n  ","387269":"\n  addiction is a mental illness characterized by a compulsive use of substances (or things such as sex or gambling, for example) to obtain a level of satisfaction despite the consequences associated with the addiction. people who are addicted to things feel as if they can't live without the substance, and often people go through withdrawals if they stop.\n  ","387270":"\n  stop caring about what other people think about you and just put yourself out there. it usually comes easier with time and age.\n  ","387271":"\n  i don't think askfm implements shadow bans. it's normal to not receive likes on all of your answers. i wouldn't think too much into it.\n  ","387272":"\n  there isn't really a measurement involved because everyone's mental health is different and subjective. that's why there are doctors such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists who help those who struggle with their mental health.\n  ","387273":"\n  your health and wellness as it relates to your emotions, personality, and feelings.\n  ","387274":"\n  i'm seeing likes on your answers. perhaps you're just not getting the notifications.\n  ","387275":"\n  yeah, compliments on my appearance in general make me uncomfortable, especially sexually-driven statements. i'd rather be complimented on my personality and my writing (although i don't post my writing on askfm).\n  ","387276":"\n  a culmination of both.\n  ","387277":"\n  i've purchased the VIP program, as well as a promotion of one or two of my answers.\n  ","387278":"\n  out of those examples, i prefer psychological and political questions. however, i don't have much of a larger preference as a whole because i enjoy most of the questions i receive regardless of their theme\/subject matter.\n  \n  i do like personalized questions the most, things that relate to my own life and interests, and for some reason i like the \"how are you?\" questions because it gives me an opportunity to express my feelings and how my day has been going.\n  ","387279":"\n  i had a really weird dream the other night that still sticks out in my mind. :\/ it wasn't necessarily a bad dream, but it was very jarring and unexpected.\n  ","387280":"\n  i'm content with the questions people ask me, but sometimes i wish they were more personalized to my life and interests.\n  ","387281":"\n  mostly racing thoughts related to how i feel about myself, my fears and triggers, constant reminders of what i'm going to do throughout my day, things i've done and\/or need to get done, and a constant loop of music.\n  ","387282":"\n  no, i've only traveled out of the united states once to visit the bahamas.\n  ","387283":"\n  yes, although i'm not sure if she was my first or not. the memories are a bit hazy, and she didn't reciprocate my feelings, so idk if that would classify as a \"first love\" or not.\n  ","387284":"\n  i'm thankfully very good at saying no, i have no issues with turning people down if i'm uncomfortable with something or just simply don't want to do something.\n  ","387285":"\n  i can't do it, LOL. my mind goes into overdrive and i end up remaining very paranoid for the rest of the night\/into the next day.\n  ","387286":"\n  i'm a writer and editor for a publishing company.\n  ","387287":"\n  you're asking the totally wrong person this question, rofl. i overthink all the time, even in professional settings (which is both a blessing and a curse). the only times my mind slows down are when i'm under the influence.\n  ","387288":"\n  yes, i most definitely trust my friends more than i trust my family. my relationship with my family is dysfunctional at best, and they've always been a source of trauma and distress for me.\n  ","387289":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm doing fine.

around 9 years.\n  ","387291":"\n  i've probably spilled a beer on someone by accident, but i don't recall any particular instances, LOL.\n  ","387292":"\n  not really, no. i have my own weird reservations about food (i.e. most of the time, i don't eat past like 5:00 or 6:00pm), but i'm not very picky at all.\n  ","387293":"\n  thank you !! i hope you are too ~~\n  \n  i woke up super early this morning despite not falling asleep until nearly 1:00am, but i strangely feel well rested. i don't have to clock into work for another 40 minutes, so i'm perusing my askfm inbox in the meantime.\n  ","387294":"\n  i don't really have a fear of germs, thankfully. it was definitely heightened when COVID was first happening, like around march to april, but i've calmed down a bit since then.\n  ","387295":"\n  simple. i don't care for glamorous or fancy things.\n  ","387296":"\n  i can sleep pretty much anywhere.\n  ","387297":"\n  this question makes me sick to my stomach, ugh.\n  ","387298":"\n  ask me questions while i watch some youtube ~~\n  ","387299":"\n  i guess i would rather be able to see my own future, considering i shouldn't really be interested in other people's lives & futures. however, the idea of seeing anyone's future, including my own, is a bit daunting to me.\n  ","387300":"\n  the feeling of happiness, much like any other emotion, is a chemical reaction from a scientific standpoint. however, that can be triggered as a result of the presence of positive emotions, if there is an absence of negative emotions, and a person's satisfaction with their life. happiness is much more complex than people realize, as it ranges in intensity and everyone's experiences with happiness are subjective.\n  ","387301":"\n  this is askfm. you can ask me questions if you'd like, but that's pretty much it. not to mention the fact that you're anonymous.\n  ","387302":"\n  i have no interest in making new friends.\n  ","387303":"\n  definitely not, i think it's absolutely disgusting.\n  ","387304":"\n  this may or may not answer this question, but it's the only thing i can think of -- i started smoking weed when i was 15\/16 years old, and i did it pretty much all the time until i was 20 years old. although i graduated high school with honors, my habit became too much during my first year of college, and i ended up failing two classes.\n  \n  fast forward to today -- up until last week, i only smoked maybe once every 1-2 months because i was cautious about how i would be able to handle it. i finally decided to buy a pen for myself last week, and i've been smoking every night before about two hours before i go to bed, and i get the most restful sleep ever. it's definitely helped me a lot, and it's also helped decrease my alcohol intake as well.\n  ","387305":"\n  yes, i saw a therapist for three years before she quit her job last february. i recently started seeing a new therapist last month.\n  ","387306":"\n  monthly reminder to follow my backup account,\n  \n   @lunampoeta\n  \n  !!\n  \n  (i regularly check my questions there & answer them once per week or so, but this is still my main account.)\n  ","387307":"\n  my day has been fine -- i haven't done much besides sleep, go out to brunch, and check up on social media, lol.\n  ","387308":"\n  that doesn't mean that you're not as deserving of respect or communication or loyalty in a friendship as you are in a relationship. your friends shouldn't make you feel like sh*t about yourself.\n  ","387309":"\n  if your friends are making you feel like a bad friend when you haven't done anything wrong, and they make you feel as if you're annoying them when you haven't done anything to warrant those feelings -- then those friends obviously are bad friends.\n  \n  friendship is supposed to be mutual and you're supposed to life each other up and be each other's support system. they're not supposed to be a source of distress.\n  ","387310":"\n  perhaps you simply don't have the right friends.\n  ","387311":"\n  i would tell them to do what makes them comfortable and to never be afraid to ask questions as to how to be a \"better\" friend. communication is key.\n  ","387312":"\n  i'm not great, but i'm not terrible either. i also haven't swam in years.\n  ","387313":"\n  no, i just said i wasn't interested in dating.\n  ","387314":"\n  no, i've never desired to be in a long distance relationship. i'd rather have someone with whom i can spend time on a regular basis.\n  ","387315":"\n  i'm not interested in dating at the moment, especially not long distance.\n  ","387316":"\n  ask me questions, friends ~~\n  ","387317":"\n  from what i remember, my week was filled with ups and downs. :\/ i have everything written in my journal so that i can talk about it with my therapist tomorrow.\n  ","387318":"\n  people who talk over others when they're in the middle of speaking. i find it very rude and disrespectful.\n  ","387319":"\n  unhealthy coping mechanisms.\n  ","387320":"\n  it's been good so far !! my roommate & i went to grab brunch this afternoon, which was really yummy.\n  ","387321":"\n  yeah, i like the neighborhood that i live in. my neighbors are all extremely nice.\n  ","387322":"\n  quietly with close friends.\n  ","387323":"\n  yeah, this has happened to me on more occasions than i can count.\n  ","387324":"\n  it'll always have meaning to me. regardless, a tattoo doesn't have to have meaning in order for it to be a great tattoo.\n  ","387325":"\n  ???\n  \n  it says \"death before decaf.\" i'm still drinking caffeine every day, rofl.\n  ","387326":"\n  they'll delete innocent questions\/answers but will refuse to IP block certain people from making accounts, it makes no f*cking sense.\n  ","387327":"\n  i usually put small amounts of sugar in my coffee, but i haven't regularly drank coffee in about 2-3 weeks.\n  ","387328":"\n  yeah, you would technically be neuroatypical then.\n  \n  i wouldn't involve yourself in all of the terms and catchphrases related to all of this though, there are so many micro-divisions of the neuroatypical community that it becomes somewhat weird, and people often ascribe themselves to terms and identities that don't necessarily relate to them as a result. i just stick with \"neuroatypical\" because it's an umbrella term that's fairly understood in most circles.\n  ","387329":"\n  i believe so, yes. typically, someone who is described as neuroatypical is a person who has a developmental, intellectual, or cognitive disorder, or mental illness(es). it's mostly used by people who have autism or are mentally ill.\n  ","387330":"\n  hopefully neurotypical with their life and emotions held together, haha.\n  ","387331":"\n  i'd consider what they say, but approach it with caution. most people who are oppressive in that fashion can also easily hide it, so i would watch them cautiously and wait to see if anything slips out.\n  \n  on the contrary, depending on my mood, i might flat out just ask them, lmaoo.\n  ","387332":"\n  singing, most definitely. i've always loved music with a passion and i would have become a vocalist if i had a good voice.\n  ","387333":"\n  through the terrors that the earth unleashes upon us through climate change.\n  ","387334":"\n  the idea sounds scary and daunting to me, lol. i can only imagine that something could go wrong.\n  ","387335":"\n  no, i don't believe in love at first sight. i believe you can't truly love a person unless you know them on a deeper level, and that doesn't exist with people you've met for only one time.\n  \n  you can have an infatuation with them, for sure, but whatever feelings of love you might have are actually lust and your expectations of what that person might be instead of who they actually are.\n  ","387336":"\n  i used to be a party person until the past few years when i've calmed down on the constant partying and settled down. now i'm totally a homebody, haha. COVID has really brought out the agoraphobia in me (albeit it's rather mild) and i seldom leave the house these days.\n  ","387337":"\n  thank you, i appreciate it ~~\n  ","387338":"\n  not really, no. i get pretty restless when i have to stay in one spot for too long.\n  ","387339":"\n  i've been having a bagel with cream cheese every morning for the past three days because my roommate bought a dozen bagels the other day, lol.\n  ","387340":"\n  thank you ~~\n  \n  my day yesterday was rather terrible, tbh. i feel a bit better today, but then again i also slept most of yesterday afternoon\/night so i'm well-rested right now.\n  ","387341":"\n  i thought i had lost my vape the other day, but it appeared under the folds of my comforter on my bed, haha. i must have put it there without realizing it when i woke up and then only found it once i made my bed.\n  ","387342":"\n  i don't believe i'm going to have children, so this is a hypothetical question for me. i'd probably find out the sex of the child prior to its birth, however, just so i can plan accordingly and prepare myself.\n  ","387343":"\n  i wouldn't know, i haven't tried doing that in years.\n  ","387344":"\n  i mean, that doesn't much matter when i only send a question out every few weeks or so and you'll be clogging my feed with answers that i can't understand everyday, lol.\n  ","387345":"\n  i like following people whose answers are mostly interesting and thoughtful, they put the time into answering questions depending on the subject matter. i also follow people who are my friends, as well as people who also receive interesting questions because i'm curious as to what their answers are.\n  ","387346":"\n  chocolate chip cookie dough and\/or green tea ice cream.\n  ","387347":"\n  good morning ~~\n  \n  thank you, i'll try. i'm supposed to go out to brunch with my roommate later today (it's only 9:00am where i live), so we'll see what happens.\n  ","387348":"\n  i think they're just about the same at the moment, i've been getting a lot more public questions because the public accounts who follow me have been asking a lot more questions lately.\n  ","387349":"\n  my best friend, my ex, and my roommate.\n  ","387350":"\n  okay. i still don't want to send questions to you, though. that would require me to follow you and i don't follow accounts whose answers aren't in english considering i can't understand a language other than english.\n  ","387351":"\n  --\n  \n   @CourtneyUwU\n  \n\n  --\n  \n   @ManicMartyrdom\n  \n\n  --\n  \n   @kittiemeowsie\n  \n\n  --\n  \n   @CelineM96\n  \n\n  --\n  \n   @TheBeesKneesGirl\n  \n","387352":"\n  probably too much time, smh. i like my morning routine of logging into askfm on my laptop and answering questions (well, on the weekends at least), which sometimes lasts a few hours if i have nothing else to do.\n  "}}
