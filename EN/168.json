gross . or if a mare is in heat they squirt and squeal and make a fuss at the male horses even if they re only around neutered males . that one is actually kinda gross lmao but not what i d consider embarrassing","155523":"never owned a credit card , never bought a lottery ticket , never gambled in a casino","155524":"i don t really think anything horses do is embarrassing . and horses don t know

down aren t worth giving the time of day to . if they really chose to take time and energy out of their own day to say mean things about you and went out of their way to be rude to you then they re

the energy for that , it just seems dumb . also worth mentioning that i ve literally never been in , been near , or even seen a large gender neutral public bathroom with many stalls . most restaurants

dead","155698":"hmmm . definitely go visit a farm and see where our food comes from . milk a cow , pet a goat , ride a horse , and collect chicken eggs . so many people have such a a sterilized view of food and don t think about where it comes from past just from the grocery store","155699":"no idea dude . i don t even have twitter or fb or anything","155700":"yeah i guess","155701":"an average person in the present","155702":"google this . i m not google","155703":"fear , then embrace .","155704":"no , research shows that horses either don t care or can t tell the difference between male and female riders and handlers . https thehorse . com do horses react differently to male and female riders this isn t to say that horses can t recognize and remember individuals though . it s been found that horses can easily remember their humans by the sound of their voices https animals . mom . com horses remember past owners . html","155705":"hi i m doing well thanks hope you re good too","155706":"nope , there isn t a h close to where i m staying rn and i move around too much to be able to commit to a volunteer schedule anyways","155707":"i am neither a guy nor am i black so i can t answer that question and i m not interested in discussing it any further","155708":"i d have to say cat","155709":"i really hate vacuuming because i don t like how it s so loud that i can t hear my environment very well . sounds silly but it kinda makes me nervous","155710":"i wanna say it s a nice blend of eros , pragma , agape if that s even possible","155711":"there s a difference between enslavement and outright murder for consumption on a mass scale . . . humans have never forcibly raped eachother over and over again , forcing someone to become pregnant and have babies for their entire lives only to rip away each child and do it again so we could steal milk from them until they were too tired to go on and died . . . . but that s what factory dairy farms do . it s easy to see the distress in an animal but it s also apparently extremely easy to also write it off as just an animal with no feelings because it cannot say in english i am in pain , i am in desperation , please stop . the difference is , to me , if animals could communicate using words then it would suddenly become a bigger moral issue because then humans would have to answer directly for killing animals by the millions , crammed in hot , smelly , houses , for the sole purpose of consuming them because we could understand without certainty that we were harming an intelligent and sentient creature . it s the same reason why people condemned sea world s dolphin and orca shows . it s because we realized those animals were extremely intelligent and were distressed and bored and that it was cruel to make them jump around every day for treats like we did . we know that with certainty , so there was public outcry . that s what i think would happen if all animals could talk . i just think it would happen much quicker since words are what humans understand the easiest","155712":"no i don t think so . destiny is ever changing and we are in control of it . we have the power to shape and reshape our own destiny based on the choices we make every day . the only thing that is truly destined for anyone is death at the end of life .","155713":"nope . a lot of people also stretch their eyelid to make it flat but i don t do that either . i have hooded eyelids so if i contort my face too much while applying eyeliner , when i let go and go back to a neutral face , the line looks funny . i just gotta stare into the mirror with a blank face and paint it on without touching anything","155714":"yeah ikr . people love asking me the weirdest stuff . . . haha anyways , cattle and horse feed tastes a whole lot better than dog food imo lol . call me crazy but i used to straight up eat the horse s barley and oats at the farm when i used to forget my lunch sometimes haha . sweet feed kinda tastes like crap though that s neat that you tested the food every day ! as i ve come to understand , aren t cows a lot less susceptible to having health issues caused by mold than horses are because of their multiple stomach and ability to vomit ? a lot of the local farmers here feed their cows round bales and stuff that have sat out in the rain all summer and winter and they don t seem affected , whereas i know you could never do that with a horse cause they d probably colic or get respiratory issues","155715":"it was something dumb about my dog haha i don t even remember what it was but my dad said something to the effect of no he won t do that and then like min later he did","155716":"yeah lol rat snakes , garter snakes , and black racers are like super common around where i m from . i used to see them in and around the brush by the side of the ring and near the hat lofts allllll the time . i don t really mind snakes though . actually i think they re kinda cool !","155717":"anything i can get in m environmental sciences idek . literally whomever will hire me with no real experience fresh out of school","155718":"i don t actually have very many early childhood memories tbh . i do

remember it was when we lived in hawaii","155719":"you said i don t need to respond but i feel like you need to hear this stop it , creep . i don t love you back and it s uncomfortable for me to keep

need","155728":"animals","155729":"don t really have one that comes to mind","155730":"that s different for everyone lol i don t know for you . but for me i think a perfect first date would be a hike or a tandem trail ride","155731":"this isn t something i can help you choose . i don t know you or your financial situation . . . that being said , most people get a car before getting a house so they can drive to work and make money so they can afford the house","155732":"not angry but probably annoyed","155733":"not sure why anyone cares about coins lol . they re pretty useless . i have like

exercise some people get being everyday office workers , how much processed food and sugar we consume , and the all consuming presence of social media and our need to feel accepted by strangers on there who we ll never meet","155740":"i told you i was confused because i ve been answering questions daily and haven t been gone . that sucks that that s how you interpreted it i guess . glad i ve been missed","155741":"iceland !","155742":"it s all about confidence . fake it until you make it and you ll just get used to it . just like the recent ask i just answered , that s just another hurdle you need to jump over in your life . one day you re going to realize that nobody s looking at you , nobody will remember any dumb things you say after like a day , the things you say aren t as dumb as you think or aren t dumb at all , nobody is judging you , and you don t need to over analyze every single second of every day . none of that matters and it never did . don t feel like you need to apologize for so many things . you are worthy , you deserve to exist , you deserve to fill your own space , and being quiet is okay . if you have something to say then say it , and if you don t then don t .","155743":"buy a fancy horse and compete in pro level equestrian events","155744":"get over it . you don t need anyone who doesn t want you around","155745":"thanks","155746":"that s a phase i

so","155800":"um ok","155801":"nice","155802":"like idk . being too forward can come off as hella creepy . just being nice and having a conversation over the course of your meeting time together and getting her snap or something at the end is much more casual and way less creepy . some women can feel pressured in those situations where men act very forward and they might be afraid to say no in fear of how he might respond . not necessarily saying you d do this of course , but some guys get angry or salty when they re rejected and they act out . it s just an extremely awkward and potentially dangerous situation for a lady to be put in , so sometimes some people end up giving out their number or whatever without really wanting to . lots of my friends have said that to me and it s happened to me before too","155803":"honestly , neither , but i like christmas a bit better than thanksgiving . thanksgiving is sometimes awkward when my weird relatives show up and make a fuss or start talking politics and christmas just makes me go broke buying gifts for people i don t even like . i love the holiday spirit though and the winter season","155804":"blue !","155805":"same honestly or they d think i was some sort of wook or hippie lol","155806":"moped for sure","155807":"if i could get my ears to equalize then sure sounds fine to me","155808":"i d rather lose all my pics . in the age of technology pics tend to be a lot more replaceable and less valued as a digital medium than they used to be as a strictly physical medium","155809":"nope , the grey in my profile pic is just one i exercise and train . the one jumping in my banner pic is my old trainer s horse i used to compete with before she moved away","155810":"i tend to like curries , butter chicken , chana masala , samosas , and basically anything that isn t too too spicy . i love anything with chicken , potatoes , chickpeas , or coconut","155811":"why are you asking me this ? i cannot speak for a group of people to which i don t belong . idk","155812":"because it s gross for me to imagine , it s arrogant to assume they d want that from you , i dislike the phrasing of your ask as it subtly takes agency

probably not . if you re in it to make money then you ll probably be disappointed . animals don t tend to make people loads of money . that s why most farmers you see aren t rolling in riches . i don t have much experience with cow or chicken or pig farms , but i know a lot more about the equestrian side of things . people who do end up making it big off of equestrian sports do it by spending their entire lives learning how to train and sell top performance animals and sometimes not always the welfare of the animals falls to the wayside as people become greedy for more money if it s a passion of yours then it s a worthwhile investment . if it s not , then it s a money pit .","156044":"i don t like fighting and in general people don t tend to want to fight me . it s obvious i m a

self in most situations i encounter . i m not a helpless , fragile , princess , made of glass . his support and backup is definitely always appreciated , but i would never solely rely on him to fight my battles for me even though i know he would in a heartbeat , he s the best as for the beast encounter situation sandy is just a person and he s not stronger than a bear . if we encountered a bear i would sit in his shoulders and make both of us look really big and scary to the bear and we d both shout at the bear to scare it away . if that didn t work then we d try to back away from it and get somewhere safe . if none of that worked i guess we d both get mauled . bears are faster , stronger , better at climbing , and better at tracking than people are . if a bear wants you dead you re about

desperate , might be a bit r niceguys worthy , or you may be trying too hard for ladies that just aren t interested in you . if she says no then don t keep trying . just move on , ya know ? doing more and hanging around waiting for her them to appreciate the things you do for love is sad . courage is a dog . . . you re a person . . . it s not the same dynamic . obvi i don t know you or them and i ve never interacted with you in person so i don t know what s really up , but maybe just be yourself and stop trying so hard or expecting people to owe you a date or something just for being nice to them . just general thoughts about other men i ve interacted with that i didn t want to engage again for one reason or another","156061":"yesiree","156062":"the future","156063":"practice empathy for

reason","156116":"you need subs to get monetized","156117":"both ! they re herd animals so they re used to looking to their leader figure for cues about how they should feel about things . that s why

bf s older brother used to do that every morning and he s super buff !","156120":"my mom thinks it s all silly and hasn t ever seen anything but my dad said he and his sister my aunt have both had several encounters with paranormal beings . i can t ask my aunt because she s since passed away but my dad said she used to live in a house that was at one point converted into a makeshift civil war hospital . said she told him on the phone once how her kids used to play with the nice man who my aunt thought was an imaginary friend . she thought he was anyways . . . well , one day when her kids were upstairs playing while she was doing laundry , she heard a scream from the attic where her kids had been playing pretend in front of their huge bay windows . she rushed upstairs to find that even though she d thought she d locked it , the giant windows were flung open , but both kids were safe and sound sitting on the floor as usual . she asked them what had happened and her daughter replied that she was playing by the window and pressed up against the old glass to look out on the yard but it opened and she fell out and screamed ! my aunt was confused because her daughter was obviously right there , and was unhurt , so she asked how she d gotten back inside and why she wasn t injured and her daughter told her she was okay because the nice man had saved her . my aunt thought she was just exaggerating or just playing pretend again so she locked the window and went downstairs to keep doing laundry . my dad then told me that she said she needed to put another load of dirty laundry into the machine , so she opened the basement door where it was located and turned on the light to go down the stairs and put it in but stopped dead in her tracks when she saw a strange , tall , man dressed in blue whom she d never met standing at the base of the stairs and smiling up at her . it scared her to death and she dropped the dirty laundry and slammed the door shut ! when she reopened it a minute later he was gone . apparently that was the very last time her kids mentioned the nice man and she never saw him again","156121":"cool","156122":"it s been ages since i rode a bike . probably a good years or so . it s not an activity i usually find super fun or interesting , idk . if you wanted to commute on a bike to any retail or restaurant job in my immediate area it would be perfect since we have loads of paved walking and biking trails around us that connect the neighborhoods and run next to the main roadways to the shopping centers . if you have any sort of career based job then it s usually in the big city and it s much too far away to bike every day . it d take you hours to get there .","156123":"yup","156124":"first time i ever ever saw anything paranormal was when i was extremely little laying down in my room at night . i was waiting for the tooth fairy to come and take my front tooth from under my pillow and leave me a quarter so i was trying to stay awake for as long as possible so i could see her . i was so excited ! around am i actually did see her that night ! . . . a small glowing blueish orb that floated from one side of the room to the other . . . i closed my eyes real tight after i watched her float across the room and pulled the blanket up over my nose because it got kinda cold ! i remember getting the chills because i was just so excited ! now looking back on it and knowing what i know now about paranormal activity it was definitely some sort of ghostly encounter . apparently blue orbs followed by cool breezes are much more common than fully manifested human forms aka like full on ghosts . that s not the only time i ever saw anything but it is the first i ever remember","156125":"cereal , popcorn , chips , anything easy to munch on in small quantities","156126":"shower for sure","156127":"but i only put one under my head to sleep . the other one i hug because it s the most comfortable way for me to lay most

shits ? it s because it s been culturally normalized , people have been doing it for thousands of years , and it s benefitted our species . eating some animal proteins is beneficial for my continued existence . a little meat every week supplementing a mostly plant based diet is healthy for a human and in order not to die people need to eat certain proteins , minerals , and vitamins . meat just happens to be a great way to acquire some of those . switching over to an omnivorous diet that included cooked meat was the vehicle that took early humans from being upright walking , hairy , apes , to more intelligent and more organized versions of ourselves like the cro magnon and neanderthal . granted , i dislike the way factory farmed animals are treated nowadays and the conditions they re subjected to , but i don t have the means to be a vegan as of now sadly . also i like chicken nuggets they re good af","156148":"sure just did","156149":"yeah but i haven t used it in years . if you

being washed . we can only do that in the summer though . they both don t mind brushing and grooming stuff . . . actually i feel like they probably like it neither eats oats , but chance eats sweet feed and his hoof growth supplement . max doesn t eat grain and can t have any of chance s bc of the hoof medicine in it although he tries his best to bully chance into letting him have some when he can . they re not mine and they re more like country pasture pets that sometimes go on trail rides so i don t think they ve ever competed a day in their lives . max is too swaybacked and old to learn to do much more than trail ride . it s not his mental state , it s his body . not too sure of his history but my guess is poorly fitting tack , riders that were too heavy , bad nutrition , and age have made his back muscles atrophy more than normal and caused him to have a much weaker back that says in the middle . the most he can do is wtc and not very beautifully or in balance . . . it makes his stride very short and choppy and awkward . if i had more time i know i could work with chance enough to get him to a point where we could show in local shows but i don t have the resources or time . max has the most bad days because he s an abuse case . he wasn t treated nicely by his previous owners and he s just very afraid of everything . it s not his fault but it gets in the way of things we want to do sometimes when he gets overwhelmed by seemingly trivial or simple things . he just needs a friend and time to relax to show him that everything is okay","156170":"i m driving down the

though that was pretty self explanatory lol","156182":"i ve heard wild wolves howl before ! but honestly a family of coyotes or foxes sound a lot more creepy . like little children screaming in the

squeeze them with my legs in a special way that tells them which lead to take , and i give them a few clucks and kiss sounds and say gallop . kinda hard to explain in words without being able to show someone p","156313":"no , i don t . hitting them wouldn t accomplish anything . they don t understand that . in a competition of strength the horse will always win , so it s just pointless and cruel to smack them around or hit or punch them for not understanding something , doing the wrong thing , or for acting up .","156314":"haha thanks . i mean , they re the exact same pic , just different
