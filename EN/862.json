However, she did not enjoy her school experience due to a combination of bullying and skipping a few grades. She was ahead of her classmates and had memories of sitting in class, staring out the window, waiting for the lesson to be over. She wanted her kids to be able to go at their own pace, even skipping several grades if that was what was right for them.\n  \n  She shared her thoughts about homeschooling with her husband and he was on board. They decided to homeschool all of the kids from kindergarten through 12th grade. She developed her own curriculum based on classic literature, Latin and Greek, the Catholic faith, and critical thinking. She wanted her kids to learn to think for themselves, to be curious and love learning, and to have strong moral compasses.\n  \n  Lynne had heard of other families who homeschooled out of fear of the world and wanted to isolate kids from that, and she did not want her kids to be isolated. And so, she signed them up for every activity possible in their area- swim team, musical theatre, basketball, gymnastics, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, karate, and many more. Her kids grew up to be a loud, vibrant bunch. They were very well \u201csocialized\u201d and had a lot of friends. Most people didn\u2019t guess they were homeschooled when they met them because of their social and people skills.\n  \n  To this day, the Cimorelli's count their homeschool experience as one of the greatest tools in their lives and careers. Because of homeschooling, they had a lot of free time to learn instruments, practice singing and harmonizing, and write songs. Homeschooling gave them the space to be free to be themselves. Being unique and independent was highly valued in the Cimorelli household; they were not told to \u201cfit into the mold.\u201d This ideal shaped their music and decisions for years to come.\n  \n  TO BE CONTINUED\u2026 more on the early days of Cimorelli coming next week!\n  ","925381":"\n  We have originals and I have originals\n  ","925382":"\n  Sometimes if they call back to back multiple times in a row\n  ","925383":"\n  I don't like showing off my body\n  ","925384":"\n  Hardworking\n  \n  Loyal\n  \n  Compassionate\n  ","925385":"\n  Cuddles\n  ","925386":"\n  I think they're cute but never wore one yet\n  ","925387":"\n  I'm okay not the greatest\n  ","925388":"\n  11\n  ","925389":"\n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/Lc-FyO0oN6U\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","925390":"\n  Sisters or children all together\n  ","925391":"\n  Yes we are shes the oldest and I'm one of the youngest\n  ","925392":"\n  Thanks for the feedback\n  ","925393":"\n  Hello\n  ","925394":"\n  Thank you\n  ","925395":"\n  Thanks\n  ","925396":"\n  Everything lol\n  ","925397":"\n  U have a fetish and I don't talk to people who are creepy\n  ","925398":"\n  Lol\n  ","925399":"\n  Sausage and cheese\n  ","925400":"\n  I don't really listen to rock music.

Changes my morning so much, brings so much more peace and clarity to my day!?? 2. I started drinking a gallon of water (128 oz) everyday which is keeping me so hydrated which makes me feel better physically and also is making my skin look so good ??? 3. I read this 70 page book at 10 pages a day called \u201cSearching For and Maintaining Peace\u201d and it changed the way I view God, myself, the people around me, my goals, literally everything. If you are seeking a deeper relationship with God, this is a MUST READ!!

I want her to live a simple but comfortable, happy life and get to experience the world. The show like toddlers and tiara basically make up tons if drama between the children and the parents. They spend thousands of dollars on just one outfit the child will most likely only wear once and never again. Flippers to have the most \"perfect smile\" when there could be absolutely nothing wrong with it.

Nick, the next brother born, was no exception to that rule. Where Christian was more quiet, thoughtful, and even philosophical, Nick was wild, fierce, and a force to be reckoned with. Nick had endless energy and hated sitting still for longer than a couple minutes. Nick was very stubborn and particular about things, similar to his sister Christina. Christian was so excited to have a brother so close to his age, as they were 18 months apart, and they quickly became best friends.\n  \n  In the year 2005, the family was completed. The last boy of the family, Joseph, nicknamed Joey, was born and he completed the trio of the youngest boys. Joey, like Nick, was full of boundless energy. He was known to run around and play with his siblings nonstop until he would randomly fall asleep in the family room. Joey was easygoing and very smiley, and like his older siblings, loved music from a young age. Joey would sing often and loved to entertain his older siblings. Christian and Nick were so happy to have another little brother to play with, and the three of them became inseparable.\n  \n  To be continued..\n  \n  Next week, we will learn more about the early days of the Cimorelli family!\n  ","925648":"\n  Only a year after Amy was born, the Cimorelli family welcomed another child, Alexander. They started calling him Alex almost immediately. Along with Lisa, Alex was one of the more introverted and shy members of the family. Whenever anyone came to the door, Alex would hide behind his mom. He was very thoughtful, observant and analytical from a young age. As a kid, Alex could be described as \u201ca man on a mission.\u201d  He was incredibly curious and used to empty out all the drawers in the house, make huge messes and stick things into the outlets. Alex was also always very sunny and smiley, and whenever people met him, they instantly loved him.\n  \n  Two years later, Lauren was born, continuing the long line of girls in the Cimorelli family. Lauren loved music and learned to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in Latin at the age of 2. She was also fearless and kept up with her older siblings. She loved skateboarding and swimming, and was confident in her ability to succeed. She was also very serious and focused, and sometimes if something she did seemed less than perfect to her, she would burst into tears of frustration. Lauren loved fashion and putting together fun and funky outfits. Christina loved dressing her up as a \u201cmodel\u201d for photoshoots, and as usual, Lauren was up to try anything!\n  \n  Not long after Lauren came into the family, another little girl was born. Danielle, although close in age to Lauren, was very different from her older sister. Where Lauren was more sporty, Dani (her nickname from a young age) was more of a girly girl and was obsessed with carrying a purse and a pink toy cell phone. Dani was sassy and fun, and up for any adventure. She loved making up games with her siblings, often creating her own \u201crestaurant\u201d  or \u201ccafe\u201d and cooking food for her siblings. Dani was quick to learn and try new things, and always excited by a new experience.\n  \n  The next child in the Cimorelli family was another boy, Christian. He was naturally deep, inquisitive and very smart. More on the introverted side, Christian loved reading and music. He started playing the drums when he was 2, learning new rhythms very quickly and with ease. Christian also loved writing songs and he made his siblings smile with the lyrics he came up with. By the time Christian was born, his older sisters Christina, Katherine and Lisa were quite a bit older than him (ages 9-12) and they loved having a baby brother\n  ","925649":"\n  Katherine was the third child. She was very different than her 2 older siblings. While they were both more intense personality-wise and welcomed confrontation, she was much more peaceful and avoided conflict. She was social, made friends easily and loved being with her friends more than anything. She was also sensitive and artistic, spending hours getting lost in books and poetry, as well as writing her own poems and stories. She was very passionate about musical theatre and she was in 16 musicals. Towards the end of her time in musical theatre, she was given a few comedic acting roles and realized how much she loved comedy.\n  \n  The fourth child was named Lisa. Lisa was similar to Christina in that she was perfectionistic and driven, but in a very different way. Lisa was very deep, self-reflective and analytical from a young age. She loved to sing and perform for her family members, often original songs she made up as a young girl. She was athletic as well, excelling in triathlons and figure skating. She was very quiet until she started to slowly started to come out of her shell around the age of 12, and out of the oldest 4 kids, she was by far the most introverted.\n  \n  Amy was next. The fifth child in the family, Amy was the smallest of all the kids. It got to the point where she didn\u2019t seem to be growing at all for a long time. At age 9, she was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Turner\u2019s Syndrome, which, among other things, affects growth. Other than being the smallest member of the family, Amy was also the most social, outgoing and people-oriented. She always had a big smile on her face. Any time a guest came over, Amy would take them by the hand and give them a tour of the house. She also was born with the loudest, most powerful singing voice in the family. Any time Amy sang, people were blown away to hear this huge, powerful voice coming out of a tiny girl.\n  \n  To be continued\u2026\n  ","925650":"\n  OUR STORY BEGINS many years ago in the small town of Lodi, California where a girl named Lynne fell in love with music. Lynne was a focused, driven individual and she devoted many hours to her two main hobbies- piano and swimming. She went on the excel in both, becoming an All-American swimmer and earning her Master\u2019s degree in Music with a concentration in Piano Performance.\n  \n  In college, while Lynne was practicing piano for hours a day for her recitals, she met and fell in love with a passionate Construction Engineering Management major named Mike. The story is that a mutual friend connected them, and they ended up meeting in the cafeteria to talk one on one for the first time. They ended up talking for so long that they lost track of time. Only when people started coming into the cafeteria for the next meal did they realize they had been talking for several hours.\n  \n  They were friends for four years. Over those four years, they remained friends but didn\u2019t date as Lynne always had a boyfriend. However, once she was single, Mike started dating her, and that was where they really got to know each. While they had both been raised Catholic, that was as far as their similarities went. Mike\u2019s family was a loud, Italian crew while Lynne\u2019s quieter Norwegian-Irish family interacted completely differently. Still, they fell in love, and they ended up moving to a small town in the hills of Northern California.\n  \n  Neither of them had planned on having a big family, but they were open to whatever God gave them. About every 18 months, they had a baby; and so, 11 kids were born. Oldest to youngest, they were named Michael (Mike Jr.), Christina, Katherine, Lisa, Amy, Alexander (Alex), Lauren, Danielle (Dani), Christian, Nicholas (Nick) and Joseph (Joey).\n  \n  The oldest kid, Michael, was born in 1989. Energetic, outgoing, and a risk-taker, he had an \u201cengineering brain\u201d from a young age. He was known for working on endless projects- taking computers apart and putting them back together, working on cars, and building half-pipes and jumps for skateboarding escapades with friends. He begged his mom to get him a guitar, and once he received it at age 12, he played rock and metal for hours a day. He was friendly and social, but also fiery and fearless.\n  \n  Next in line was the second child, Christina. Christina was driven, perfectionistic, and a born leader. When she was 7 years old, she asked her mom to order her a planner she had found in a catalogue. She waited every day for it to be delivered. Then when she received it, she scheduled out her days, including blocks for \u201cfree time.\u201d With her focus, determination and talent, she excelled at anything she tried, achieving level 6 in gymnastics, breaking records on swim team, learning the piano at age 2, and earning lead roles in musicals. She became a leader for her siblings, setting the bar high in her accomplishments and moral standards.\n  \n  Katherine was the third child. She was very different than her 2 older\n  ","925651":"\n  Justin bieber is getting married today :(\n  \n  \"Alexa play that should be me\"\n  ","925652":"\n  Yeah aha\n  ","925653":"\n  Hello, but on a side note I'm so excited we get to go on tour and it starts in a few weeks \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d cant wait to see y'all\n  ","925654":"\n  Throw back\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/2EF4zrwmrT8\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","925655":"\n  New post on our tiktok!!\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B3C_OdQn8xt\/?igshid=19pjwbi29zoyw\n  \n","925656":"\n  Remove the its and you'll find\n  ","925657":"\n  Christina asked this awhile ago and stated she sits in the front but I think I would rather take a bus or train or just walk lol heard way to many horror stories about uber\n  ","925658":"\n  Its spooky season :))\n  ","925659":"\n  \ud83d\udc40\n  ","925660":"\n  You won't be able to see it for a few weeks :)\n  ","925661":"\n  Our wifi been out all day today \ud83d\udc40\n  ","925662":"\n  Maybe because everything starts to fall into something like animals fall into a hibernation, the leaves fall to the ground, the temperature falls into a chill ?\n  ","925663":"\n  No but accidentally smacked him in the area because I went to go swing back\n  ","925664":"\n  DEAD \ud83d\udc80 \ud83d\ude02\n  \n\n   https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/augustxcloud\/status\/1178716737912659970\n  \n","925665":"\n  My sister lisa used to say it was her favorite color \ud83d\ude02 but it can look nice with some things as long as its not over excessive\n  ","925666":"\n  If its all a dream...

(Not pictured on here but my insta) This week I think I did pretty well with managing the amount of pressure I put on myself. I found myself a new mantra for when I start freaking out about potentially not doing something perfectly: \u201cI could choose peace over this.\u201d And then letting it go as best I can. I\u2019m trying to start seeing succeeding and doing well as an option I get to choose rather than something that I absolutely must do or else I will die cause with the amount of anxiety that whole concept causes me, it seems to be that I\u2019ve been seeing it as a life or death thing. I\u2019m reading a book called \u201cSearching for and maintaining interior peace\u201d and I would highly recommend it for anyone seeking peace.
