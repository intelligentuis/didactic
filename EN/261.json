But we do it anyway.\n  ","280322":"\n  I was only kidding about the fake wiki thing, Jeez!\n  \n  You guys have already taken a big step by trying to fix people's posting somewhat. The single biggest problem has always been that the wiki looks like it was run and written by non-English speaking foreign children and lazy illiterates (SPELL CHECK IS FREE AND TAKES NO TIME). Please understand, I'm not trying to bash people who speak other languages, Ben 10's international fans are hugely important to the franchise, and they should be welcome to contribute to the Ben 10 community because they love the show too. But there should be a moderator who fixes grammar and whatnot. And it does look like that is happening more now. But that's the single biggest issue, getting the articles to look like they are competently written.\n  \n  Here's a  paragraph from the wiki. It isn't riddled with spelling\/grammar error or anything, but let's look at how it's written:\n  \n  \"In Omniverse, Hope returns to wearing a pink and purple color schemed coat. She has a bigger ponytail and her hair also has been dyed purple in some places. She now has black marks under her eyes. She is also now able to don heavy armor with skulls and the color of her stone creatures. Her ears also have two golden earrings.\"\n  \n  What a clunky and strangely worded mess that is! I'm no writer, but isn't something like this nicer?:\n  \n  \"Omniverse's Charmcaster returns to a color scheme similar to the original series, while retaining the skirt and some thematic elements from her UAF appearance. Her stark white hair is now framed with purple highlights, and like the original series, she has her hair in a ponytail. She wears gothic \"Eye of Horus\" styled eye makeup and golden earrings. Charmcaster has developed the ability to merge with her Rock Monsters to create a secondary armored form, that retains the stone texture and color of her creatures.\"\n  \n  Also, those \"trivia\" section factoids feel like they miss the mark like half the time. Just because YOU think something in the show reminds you of something else in pop culture, does not mean that was the creator's intention. The trivia section looks like it's written as if the info comes right from the creators, and it doesn't. If you are going to put those opinions in, at least write them as opinions, not as \"facts.\"\n  \n  Sometimes it's really outrageous, the things that are considered to be \"canon\" or \"jokes\" over there. The whole Darkstar totem thing is still vaguely annoying. Whoever made the judgement call on that thing made a very foolish error. The counterpoint argument was groundless, and absolutely absurd.\n  \n  Everyone who works on the Ben 10 wiki should be looking at the Transformers wiki. TFWiki.net is widely considered to be one of the best fan wikis around.\n  \n  I hope this will be taken only for what it is: My personal opinions and constructive criticisms that I am giving because I was asked for them.\n  ","280323":"\n  Yeah!\n  ","280324":"\n  That is Mr. Pip.\n  ","280325":"\n  That is totally not how it started.
