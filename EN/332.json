i m not worrying incessantly about work after i ve come home , and i have a lot of support from my supervisors regarding my mental and physical health , something that was lacking in my prior jobs . they ve also entrusted in me the opportunity to complete freelance work on the weekends alongside my monday through friday work , which means extra income . there s a lot of growth available with this company , and i can see myself staying here for a number of years .","307116":"i m not conventionally good looking , so there s really nothing i can get based on my looks alone . in that same vein , there isn t anything i want that could be acquired by having good looks anyway .","307117":"i admit when i m wrong because i never want to give off the impression that i m stubborn , ignorant , or a toxic person . i m always trying to rectify my wrongdoings because i m also terrified of my friends being angry with me .","307118":"he s one of the most intelligent and hardest working people i know . we connect on an intimate level , more than with anyone else i ve ever talked with before . we can sit down and have conversation for hours and never get bored , and we can also sit down and laugh over silly , nerdy things together without judgment . he s also one of the strongest people i know in that he s endured a lot of hardship but has never let it overcome him or deter him from his goals .","307119":"ideally , it should be . there isn t much you can do with a person in the long run if you re going off of their looks alone . you should be able to have a conversation with them on an emotional level .","307120":"making impulsive decisions without any regard for how future me is going to feel about those decisions . jumping to erratic conclusions based on vague evidence . drinking large amounts of iced coffee in small increments of time .","307121":"lmao , no ? ? i don t use big or complicated words on askfm .","307122":"i m going to a party for my best friend s husband s th birthday tonight . tomorrow , i m working on some freelance assignments and then i have a cocktail party for work in the evening . sunday , i don t have any plans besides finishing up my freelance work .","307123":"addiction is a disease it s a mental health condition and its listed under substance abuse disorders in the dsm . while you do make the choice to do a drug , you obviously don t choose to be addicted . it literally rewires your brain and causes psychological and physiological changes that are out of your control .","307124":"i m just going to leave this here .","307125":"it is for me , i would never spend that much money on a phone . but if other people have the disposable cash and want to drop one grand on a phone , that s their choice .","307126":"i was kicked out of walmart once because my friend stole something , so they kicked out all three of us since we all went together .","307127":"right now , it s breezy and overcast . however , this morning there were torrential downpours of rain . it s probably going to rain again later too .","307128":"lately i ve been listening to mike shinoda , macklemore , grandson , watsky , and bryce vine . however , some of my top favorites are linkin park , stone temple pilots , korn , soundgarden , and alice in chains .","307129":"my main goal is to find happiness and also make my loved ones happy .","307130":"i ve been losing weight through healthy dieting and exercising . i lose motivation sometimes too , but you have to keep reminding yourself that nothing will happen if you don t actively work towards your goals . it also isn t an overnight process .","307131":"honestly , it s been terrible . i ve been having stomach problems since last night and actually left work early due to getting sick and running to the bathroom three times in three hours . i took a nap and feel a little better , but my stomach is still killing me . i m going to try to distract myself with some xbox .","307132":"with my boyfriend , obviously . lol . we ve been together for eight years .","307133":"i would honestly have no idea . i only know a few people who are twins , lol . and it s not as if there s any way to predict what gender a person is , so it s basically impossible to know .","307134":"no , i m in a relationship .","307135":"he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man . it s always held a deeper meaning to me because it reminds me of my youth , and my behavior thought processes when i was younger . i did a lot of things that i gave the impression that they were fun , when in reality i was just masking the fact that i was in a lot of emotional pain .","307136":"surprise , i have a twin","307137":"i don t spoil myself very often , although i know that i should for my own mental health . self care days are important . the last time i spoiled myself was a few days ago when i splurged on two pairs of shoes . idk if that s really considering spoiling myself , though , because i kinda needed them since i only have one pair of shoes with adequate support .","307138":"this is my most recent one .","307139":"so after seeing other people s answers , i realize you mean partying and drinking or doing drugs . yes , i used to be heavily involved in that kind of behavior where it did negatively impact my work and my personal relationships .","307140":"be yourself regardless of who dislikes it . your true friends will stick around and you don t need to prove yourself to anyone . focus on school and study hard . getting an education is important and a lot of teenagers don t realize that . there are always avenues for help if you need it , and you re never alone in your struggles . you have friends , family , guidance counselors , teachers , and doctors at your disposal . don t feel pressured to do things that you don t want to do . those who genuinely care about you will understand if you don t want to party or do drugs , for example , and those who get angry with you probably don t deserve your friendship anyway . dating isn t as important as it seems and you have your entire adulthood to date around . don t feel pressured to be in a relationship or have sxx if a lot of people around you are . if you don t want to have sxx or be involved with someone , you don t need to be .","307141":"probably , my mother has been talking about it a lot recently . she wants another dog but my father doesn t seem too keen on the idea . i would personally love another dog , though . it ll help me a lot with my mental health issues .","307142":"no , i only made one or two friends . i didn t dorm or stay at the college all the time , so there wasn t any time or reason for me to make friends . i basically went to class and came home .","307143":"i honestly haven t been feeling well mentally for the past few days , so i have no inspirational speeches to give . i m always an advocate for recognizing your strength , but for me personally , it s difficult to do that sometimes because i still feel weak and powerless . however , you shouldn t forfeit in the face of adversity . there are no white flags to be waving , and if you ve made it this far in life , then you ve already won . no matter who you are , everyone faces immense struggle in life from time to time , and the fact that you survived thus far is a testament to your strength and will power , and that s something of which to be proud .","307144":"just forget about the past . if it was that easy , then i wouldn t be in long term treatment for recurrent svicidal ideation and multiple mental illnesses , lol .","307145":"you evidently don t understand how having svicidal thoughts work . even if someone has moved on from trauma , they can still experience svicidal thoughts . it s a chronic side effect of a lot of mental illnesses , even if that person hasn t experienced trauma at all . it takes a lot of therapy for people to come to terms with their thoughts and find incentive to continue moving forward .","307146":"i ve never smoked hookah before , actually .","307147":"lol , yeah . when i was a teenager , i tried trimming my bangs by myself . it turned out absolutely terrible , as they were incredibly uneven .","307148":"yeah , i definitely do that a lot . my brain processes information a lot faster than i can speak , so i have a tendency to stumble over my words , skip out on words , combine words , say them in the wrong order , etc etc . i m not really good at verbally expressing how i feel either , which is why i garner much solace in writing things down .","307149":"long distance relationships take a lot of work , so it feels different in the aspect that you have to really put aside a lot of time and effort in order to maintain the relationship by talking to them routinely , and letting them know how much you re thinking of them and appreciating them . similar to having a relationship where you two see one another regularly , there needs to be a lot of open and honest communication , as well as a strong foundation of trust .","307150":"it took me a few months to warm up to my boyfriend , yeah . especially considering i didn t know what to do in our situation since i was moving to another state for college soon , so i wasn t sure how much of myself was safe to offer to him . i don t remember much about meeting my best friend for the first time because we were both years old , though . the only thing i remember is that we bonded over our love for linkin park , which basically solidified the foundation of our friendship .","307151":"i don t tolerate any forms of ableism , racism , sexism , homophobia , or transphobia , among other methods of discrimination . society should be inclusive , even though it isn t on a variety of scales . i always try to be an advocate for inclusivity and educate others on the nuances of various social issues , which includes gender , sex , lgbt rights , and disability and mental health awareness .","307152":"lately i ve been switching between criminal minds and breaking bad . both are really good shows . i also really enjoy the x files , ncis , how i met your mother , parks and rec , orange is the new black , wentworth , stranger things , the killing , supernatural , and various crime documentaries .","307153":"i love the art from this artist , they re always so uplifting and beautiful .","307154":"i only really watch achievement hunter , markiplier , and seananners on youtube .","307155":"my boyfriend i don t really spend much time together to begin with , but we do usually need breaks from other people and require alone time , respectively . when i need to be alone , i usually relax by watching tv or just laying down and listening to music .","307156":"my boyfriend told me that we can have a bbq and a fire tonight , which made me smile . he knows that i always love spending time outside with him .","307157":"i can t believe it s been one year . you ve taught me so much about growth , mental health , and survival . and i don t think i would have made it this far if it wasn t for you . rest in paradise , chester . you were a beacon in this world and you taught us to grieve in the wake of your death . we all miss you .","307158":"i have dissociative amnesia , meaning i can t remember huge chunks of my life . i don t remember the first years of my life and my teenage years are mostly a blur .","307159":"laying in bed having an existential crisis , no big deal .","307160":"i m the same way , it s such a shitty feeling . you have to remember that everyone goes through life according to their own timeline , though , and its difficult to compare others without considering your and their circumstances individually . every person s situation is different and usually people s lives are much different than how they portray them on social media .","307161":"i don t post photos of my family on askfm .","307162":"i ve only mentioned that i had a degree once within the past week or two , and it was literally a question about intelligence where i said that i was of average intelligence . i m not perfect by any means so idk where you would get that assumption from . i have more flaws than attributes .","307163":"i m constantly talking about my flaws , rofl .","307164":"my pet peeves pretty much all have to do with other people , as i basically hate most of humanity , lol . that includes shitty drivers people who don t use their blinkers , drive too car to my car , cut me off while switching lanes , don t allow me to merge , etc etc .","307165":"i ve done plenty of things for the first time , so you ll have to be more specific . i have to admit , though , the first time i drove was absolutely terrifying even though there was an instructor in the car with me .","307166":"not at all . nudity is just a human being in their natural state , nothing more or less .","307167":"i highly doubt it . i haven t heard anything indicating that the site will be taken down .","307168":"no ? ? i don t know any job that does that .","307169":"my day has been fine . nothing out of the ordinary . i m on my lunch break right now and i m debating on what sort of drink to buy from the store .","307170":"yeah , definitely . the medication helps my depression anxiety a lot and therapy has helped me develop better and healthier coping mechanisms to deal with my triggers .","307171":"i ve never watched any matches or anything , but i think it s a cool way to make money . i ve always wanted to make money by playing video games professionally , rofl .","307172":"obviously the tide pod challenge was the worst one because people died from it . i think challenges in general are silly , though .","307173":"no . i don t go to zoos because i can t handle seeing the animals in such conditions . they re often mistreated there .","307174":"when my boyfriend does something kind for me that s unexpected . the other morning , he woke up before me and made me a cup of coffee for me to drink when i woke up . he brought it right to the bed , which i thought was really sweet .","307175":"i don t have any games on my phone . they use up too much battery .","307176":"i m not interested in speaking to someone from askfm either . i m only here to answer questions .","307177":"idk , but it bothers me sometimes , lol . i ll be proud of my makeup when i see it in the mirror , but it doesn t usually translate well into photos .","307178":"he s the hardest working person i know and he s extremely passionate about animals . he s always there for me to listen and offers unbiased but gentle advice for when i m struggling , and he s always down for conversing about difficult topics .","307179":"i haven t written something in a few months , but i usually write nonfiction essays and poetry .","307180":"i ve recently gotten into the habit of eating veggie burgers as opposed to beef burgers , and i absolutely love them . i love how versatile they are and how you can make them with an assortment of different things .","307181":"criminal minds , ncis , unbreakable kimmy schmidt , the killing , the x files , how i met your mother , parks and rec , supernatural , breaking bad , ghost hunters , paranormal lockdown , and ghost adventures .","307182":"i wouldn t be friends with someone who s so young that they re going through puberty . that s just bizarre and gross .","307183":"you can please refrain from calling me dear , it isn t a nickname i m comfortable with . however , good morning","307184":"depends what you mean by the call of duty . i m willing to help people as long as it doesn t put my own health at risk .","307185":"i think this question is what fueled the last question i answered on my page . in short , if you re over the age of , you can use any media site you want within reason unless the site it . there s no age limit to social media , and i would even go so far as to say that those who are should use social media more due to their wisdom . for me personally , i m turning this year . i use facebook , instagram , askfm , twitter , and snapchat .","307186":"no . you can be on social media at any age after the age of . most social media sites indicate that you shouldn t be under to use their sites however , there s absolutely no age limit .","307187":"lol , no . i don t have any valuables or assets therefore , i don t have a will .","307188":"obviously , considering we re all homosapiens .","307189":"he can still be worried about me even when i don t express my svicidal thoughts to him . he s worried about my depression , my anxiety , my panic attacks , my behavior and impulses , etc etc .","307190":"yeah , most of them do . my boyfriend has told me that he s constantly worried about me and he s always checking up on me , which is something i do appreciate . yesterday , for example , he went out to run a few errands and i stayed home to finish up some work . i decided to lay down when i was done , so when he got home , he got concerned and thought i was having an episode because i was just laying in bed with all the lights off . i was fine , but a lot of the time i m not fine which is why he acted that way .","307191":"no , they all pretty much have the same effect on me . i just drink different things depending on my mood that night .","307192":"in my current relationship , no . we ve established and built a relationship that has been eight years in the making . to throw all of that away and break that foundation of trust would be devastating , and even if he apologized , that doesn t take away from the fact that he purposely did something to betray that trust , knowing it would hurt me .","307193":"i know a few people who complain about their lives but do nothing to change it , unfortunately . they constantly try to make other people feel bad for them but they re not willing to make positive steps to change themselves or their lives . i m thankfully not this person , at least not anymore . i used to be really unhappy with my life and was too depressed to change anything , but recently i ve stepped my game up and started working towards improving myself .","307194":"you re probably better off asking someone who s a girl .","307195":"in a sense , i sorta understand what you mean . however , in order to live in this society we must deal with those expectations regardless of whether or not they re ridiculous . it doesn t change the truth of how reality is and it doesn t diminish the struggles people face as a result of those societal expectations . you can t simply pretend that they don t have an effect on people .","307196":"for something to be abnormal , it has to be out of the norm . being mentally ill isn t out of the norm and its actually a lot more common than people realize .","307197":"i like being able to escape into the book i m reading and forget about the worries or troubles of my everyday life . i love books that completely captivate you and draw you into the world completely .","307198":"guess i m boring then .","307199":"i deal with intrusive thoughts and memories often , and tbh i just try to let them pass and give myself positive affirmations and remind myself of how much i ve endured , and it helps me let them pass . therapy helps too , but i know not everyone has access to that .","307200":"probably because they feel as if they don t deserve to be valued or taken care of properly by other people .","307201":"idk about a farm , but the idea of living in a rural area is appealing to me .","307202":"i don t post photos of my friends on askfm .","307203":"i think that s a toxic invalidating mindset . people recognize that they re mentally ill , especially with respect to depression and anxiety , and not everyone can afford to be professionally diagnosed , obtain medication , or attend therapy . it doesn t make someone struggle less if they re not in treatment , since treatment is often a privilege unfortunately . that being said , i don t agree with self diagnosis of complex disorders because that should be diagnosed by a trained professional , since they re the only ones who can differentiate one disorder from the other . it s fine to have suspicion that you have an illness but if you re going around saying that you re definitely borderline or dependent or antisocial , then that is just insulting to people who genuinely do have those disorders .","307204":"lately i ve been enjoying the answers of the following users courrtana country peach babycadiex perfectionistgirl urlsareshittbh","307205":"this is the only one i have saved to my phone","307206":"i haven t done anything lately , but i used to paint and take photographs often . i also write poetry .","307207":"i m not into dance , but i do enjoy art both observing it and making it .","307208":"they re quite similar , so it all depends on your own personal preference . i prefer yoga over meditation because i m giving my body a workout , and it s also difficult for me to really meditate .","307209":"do you mean blood water by grandson ? ? if so , then yeah i absolutely love that song .","307210":"i like his serious roles more than his funny roles , actually .","307211":"it s so good i recommend it . i m only six episodes into season one but it s really enjoyable . a good mixture of drama with a hint of comedy .","307212":"zero , lol .","307213":"absolutely . people shouldn t be subjected to discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender , so i m fully in support of the bill . for those who don t know , the sogie bill is a bill in the philippines that stands for sexual orientation and gender identity or expression and it seeks to prevent discrimination against people based on their orientation or gender identity .","307214":"perhaps those guys should reevaluate their relationships then . if you re in a monogamous relationship , then ideally the only person you should want to be with is your partner .","307215":"no . it s actually quite common . people usually mind their own business and care about their own lives , especially if they re already out with friends or running errands .","307216":"don t say you support people with mental illness then abandon them when their symptoms start to act up . supporting those who are mentally ill means you re there for your friends through the good times as well as bad times , and they need extra support during those times when things get bad .","307217":"thanks , lyndsey . i appreciate it . my boyfriend knew it was going to happen , but i was too optimistic in his recovery . he s been sick the past few weeks and it got progressively worse over the past three days , despite the fact that we were giving him routine medication . it was difficult to make that decision . but ultimately you have to decide what s best for your dog , and it would have been cruel to prolong his suffering any more than it was .","307218":"i m sorry to hear about your dog too they genuinely are members of the family , though . losing one is like losing a segment of yourself . the house felt so empty today , it was unsettling . everyone has been a wreck since he passed away . he was years old , but it didn t feel as if his time was here yet . it happened so quickly .","307219":"i wish i had bonfires at night more often with my friends . they re usually so much fun , but we all work conflicting schedules so it s difficult to really gather everyone around .","307220":"i don t really lie often enough to know if i am or not .","307221":"my most debilitating habit is skin picking i have horrid marks and scars all over my arms as a result , and sometimes people point it out to me and make it quite embarrassing .","307222":"don t come on strongly take your time with talking to them . if they say no , then leave them alone . however , if you re consistently getting blocked , then you have to sit back and analyze what you re doing objectively that makes you sound like a creep . it isn t coincidence .","307223":"i m not really sure i used to be greatly into buddhism hinduism when i was younger , but as i got older , i fell out of the mindset and became less interested in their perspectives . it s nothing against the religions themselves , i just think i lost my personal value in them and started focusing more on my mental health , studies , and personal life .","307224":"i don t believe in any form of a higher power . i m not really religious or spiritual anymore .","307225":"student loans rent , lol . i wish rent was less expensive so that i can afford an apartment on my own , or at the very least , my student loans were less expensive so that there s a chance i can allocate that extra money toward rent .","307226":"i m actually outside rn . it s cool and breezy , the sun is setting , and everything has that golden hue to it .","307227":"i don t believe in sin . however , if i hypothetically did , then i would think that the difference between the two would be regret . when you re committing a sin , you don t regret your actions . there s no guilt involved . however , mistakes are usually made and there s guilt regret involved , which is what defines them as a mistake to begin with .","307228":"my best friend boyfriend are very non judgmental people so they ve always helped me out when i found myself in a weird or awkward situation . at the same time , they also make fun of me for it because i have a tendency to make things more awkward than necessary without meaning to , lol .","307229":"i d create more awareness regarding mental health , and specifically , personality disorders schizophrenia did . there s a lot of misconception about all three and people should know that someone isn t inherently violent if they have a certain disorder .","307230":"that doesn t matter . i m not here to entertain anyone s fetish , i m here to answer questions . you re lucky enough that i m comfortable posting photos of my face here .","307231":"i think you re setting your hopes too high because you already know that i won t do that .","307232":"mine is the maroon color ! ! i haven t changed it in ages , but i ll usually do pink or black as well .","307233":"it isn t really something you can learn through books . you just have to socialize more and get yourself out there .","307234":"smh .","307235":"cont . . . accidentally got on the table . i erased it and everything but the teacher saw that as a reason to take us both into a closet , have a teaching assistant restrain me , and whoop me with a paddle multiple times . my skin was actually bruised and i was squirming so much that one point she hit me in between my legs . i couldn t even walk for the next few days and sitting h u r t . my parents were infuriated and thankfully both the teacher and teaching assistant were fired . omg . i m so happy they were both fired , but that doesn t make their actions any less abvsive . i m so sorry you had to go through that at such a young age ! ! this is beyond disgusting to me .","307236":"yeah that s so ridiculous , omg .","307237":"this sounds like something a child would say then immediately give their friend a high five due to their sick burn .","307238":"omg , for kindergarten kids ? ! i m so appalled right now .","307239":"yeah , i m not going to entertain the notion anymore . it s getting silly i don t want to clog my feed with this .","307240":"i m not going to repeat myself regarding those definitions for a third time . however , you can believe whatever you want to believe obviously there s no reasoning with you otherwise .","307241":"? ? ? you didn t give me evidence at all . you re talking about magic dragons , lol . i provided you with an objective source of information regarding gender . that s all i can really do in this case .","307242":"this makes absolutely no sense , i hope you realize that . i m beginning to wonder if you re just trolling me at this point , so unless you have factual evidence to provide , i m going to have to end this conversation .","307243":"there are countless examples of homophobia that exist , so the idea that you re denying it is a bit worrisome . regardless , your analogy is a bit far fetched and not rooted in reality .","307244":"i ll give them the benefit of the doubt .","307245":"like i stated , rudimentary definitions aren t a sound basis upon which to explain the difference between sex and gender . it s a sociological and psychological topic of study and has existed for centuries . however , there are unbiased facts regarding both concepts and it has nothing to do with whether someone is part of the lgbt community or an ally . your statements makes you sound a wee bit homophobic , though . in addition , the example you just provided is largely used by transphobic people who don t believe that trans people exist , as there s no logical way a person could identify as an animal .","307246":"if you read the text , it gives a profound explanation of gender . i don t really expect you to read it now , but please bookmark it and read it sometime if you have time to spare .","307247":"there have been studies that suggest that sexual orientation is established in a child s adolescence , as many children realize their sexual orientation from a very young age . a lot of people don t really realize their sexual orientation until puberty years because they re conditioned into believing that being heterosexual is the default orientation .","307248":"rudimentary definitions aren t a sound basis upon which to establish an understanding of something as complex as the difference between sex and gender . https www . genderspectrum . org quick links understanding gender this link explains the difference between the two fairly well .","307249":"again , you re thinking about sex people can have transition surgery to change their genitals and undergo hormone therapy to alter their secondary sex characteristics . you re right that someone s sexual orientation does not have any correlation with their gender . but again , your idea of gender is actually the definition of what sex is .","307250":"i just explained how sex gender are different . they re not synonymous with each other anymore because society as a whole has developed a deeper understanding of what gender truly is and how it is and isn t correlated with people s assigned sex . your sex is biological and is dependent upon your chromosomes . your gender is your perception of yourself .","307251":"thanks , my dude","307252":"no , you re thinking about sex . your sex is dependent upon your chromosomes , which in term influences what genitalia you develop . there s also a term called intersex , which is a chromosomal anomaly in which people aren t entirely male or female . gender , however , is different from your sex . you can be a man , woman , non binary , etc etc . gender exists on a spectrum so there s really no number as to how many genders there are , but nevertheless they all fall under the trans spectrum unless a person is cisgender meaning their gender aligns with their assigned sex .","307253":"can you explain why ? ?","307254":"yeah , absolutely . for example , it wouldn t be appropriate for a woman to wear short shorts and a tube top to work in an office or retail environment . even if the dress code is casual , that doesn t mean that people can wear any clothing they want .","307255":"obviously neither .","307256":"i couldn t be a therapist because i don t think i d be able to handle other people s problems on top of my own . i can empathize with people but i invest myself too much into other people s emotions to begin with .","307257":"that makes a lot of sense ! ! i can get behind that .","307258":"i wish i was better at singing . i absolutely love to sing , but my voice is terrible . if i had a decent singing voice , i probably would have entered the music industry .","307259":"i d say they re fairly equal . i m a fast reader , but since i ve been typing on computers since i was a child , i ve become pretty fast at typing too .","307260":"i m terrified of driving , but it s something i have to do practically every day . the idea of getting behind the wheel and risking myself to the potential of being injured or k lled scares me , especially considering i drive on mainly highways where people drive mph .","307261":"i like cool ranch doritos , cheddar sour cream ruffles , and salt vinegar lays .","307262":"no , the only language i speak is english .","307263":"i won t answer invasive questions about my sxx life or trauma , and i don t respond to trolls most of the time .","307264":"my best friend likes to talk things through , but my boyfriend requires a lot of space .","307265":"yes , my moods are easily swayed by other people s moods , especially when it comes to my boyfriend best friend . if either of them are having a particularly bad day , then it usually puts me in a terrible mood because i feel as if i can t do anything to help them .","307266":"i m not sure what the protocols are when it comes to field trips . i would assume that the parents have the authority over the teachers when it comes to those instances , but i m not versed in education .","307267":"i disagree to an extent . i think parents should discipline their children and encourage them to do better in school if they re getting poor grades , especially if they re getting detention for acting out or neglecting to do their work . kids won t learn unless their parents teach them the correct way . if a parent ignores the fact that their child is doing poorly in school , then the child won t learn how to reverse their behavior . they need guidance .","307268":"i don t really see what this has to do with me . this is a conversation between you and morgan , and i have no involvement in this at all . cc littlesha","307269":"morgan is another person on askfm who isn t afraid to call people out on their bullsh t if they re being rude , invasive , or otherwise trolling . if morgan is being mean to you , then you did something to warrant her behavior . otherwise , she s quite pleasant and fun to talk to .","307270":"i try my best to always be upfront and honest , and i m also not afraid to call people out if they re doing something wrong or harmful . i also believe communication is key to all relationships , romantic or otherwise .","307271":"i used to watch it occasionally when i was younger , but i haven t seen it in years .","307272":"you re welcome ! !","307273":"absolutely . she sees it like it is and has no qualms over putting someone in their place .","307274":"celine is one of the nicest people i ve ever had the pleasure of speaking with . she s also not afraid to call people out on their bullsh t if they re being rude or invasive . if she s being mean to you , then you did something that warranted it . cc celinem","307275":"no , not generally . i usually referred them to the pharmacist since i have no medical training whatsoever .","307276":"i dislike him greatly . i think he s incredibly rude , entitled , and racist , among other things . he s a celebrity , not a political figure .","307277":"at this point , probably donald trump .","307278":"i used to work at a drug store , so i ve seen and heard plenty of inappropriate and disgusting things coming from the mouths of customers . i worked in the pharmacy sometimes , and customers would always ask me questions regarding their bowel movements or sxx lives , and it was incredibly uncomfortable .","307279":"i don t remember much about high school because that was a tumultuous time of my life however , it did slightly bother me that the students who were good at sports were given a pass when it came to grades or discipline simply because they gave the school a good name when it came to sports events .","307280":"i definitely don t prefer eating foods high in fat sugar because i m in the process of losing weight , but every now and again i ll splurge on an egg sandwich because they re delicious . lately i ve been trying to eat low carb , low sugar foods and focusing more on protein and healthy fats i . e . avocados . i m still in the process of figuring out what are the best things to eat , though .","307281":"this might come as a surprise , but honestly no . i ve gone through hardship and have made my mistakes , but it s transformed me into a stronger , wiser , better person . it s taken me a long time to realize and accept that fact , but i m growing to appreciate who i am and my perseverance .","307282":"yes ! ! my boyfriend recently commissioned a friend of ours who s a terrific artist to paint me a fallout inspired picture , and it came out beautiful . it s still sitting against my dresser , i need to hang it up soon .","307283":"honestly , i can personally tell by the vibe they give off . i m very suspicious of people who i think aren t good , and most of the time , i m right after learning more about them or when their true colors come out .","307284":"chill hip hop , like grieves and atmosphere . i also really like bryce vine , he s more pop ish but still really chill .","307285":"no , unfortunately they saw what happened . my boyfriend and his best friend were doing yard work at my house his best friend leaned against a low fence separating my yard from my neighbor s yard , and he accidentally broke a part of the fence . my neighbor came out a few minutes later , fuming , and demanded that they replace the fence immediately lmao .","307286":"i don t like cooking or baking at all , lmao . i like the fact that people are enjoying what i made but the process is so tedious to me .","307287":"i tried to cut my own bangs once when i was a teenager and it was a disaster , lmao .","307288":"i m so sorry you two are going through this . it depends on the person though . sometimes people need space while other people need comfort . ask your best friend what she needs and if there s anything you can do to help .","307289":"you can t really force a child to make friends , it has to happen naturally . take your child places where there are other children so that they can be socialized .","307290":"no , i usually just read outside in the natural light .","307291":"that isn t really dissociation and what you experience is normal , so i wouldn t be concerned .","307292":"a few months ago . i really need to make an appointment , though . my shaved side has grown out so much and it s been bothering me .","307293":"i don t use kik .","307294":"yeah ! ! i use medisafe . it sends you notification reminders at whichever time you choose if you don t tell it that you took your meds , it will send you reminders every minutes .","307295":"at times , yes . sometimes i get frustrated with who i am or where my life has led me , and sometimes i get angry because of how unfair my life has been at times . however , through mental health treatment , i ve learned to appreciate what i do have and i m slowly learning how to love myself for who i am .","307296":"i prefer watching tv series . they re quicker to get through and its really easy to binge watch a few episodes in a row .","307297":"sip ginger ale eat lightly toasted bread . it s one of the best ways to settle your stomach after vomiting . also remember to stay hydrated . gatorade or electrolyte popsicles are good for that .","307298":"i live on an island , so it gets very humid where i live . thankfully it isn t humid out today , though ! ! my boyfriend i have just been hanging outside because it s gorgeous out .","307299":"i enjoy writing , playing video games , reading , and painting . i haven t done the latter two in a while , but i have gotten back into the habit of writing routinely .","307300":"i actually enjoy washing dishes doing the laundry ! ! i ll wash anyone s laundry , i just love how good they smell when they re done .","307301":"interesting ! ! thank you , i wasn t really aware of those differences . it s not something i ve ever really looked into , to be honest .","307302":"no , not really . it wasn t so much trying to fit in as much as it was to remain up to date on trending issues , especially when it comes to politics .","307303":"oh yeah , lmao . not that these people have good reputations to begin with , but i definitely have a lot of information that could ruin their image and lives for good .","307304":"my phone is a samsung galaxy s .","307305":"isn t polygamy marriage among different individuals polyamory is basically being in an open relationship where both partners have the option of dating other people or have partners at the same time ? ? this could be way off , but idk .","307306":"? ? ? i never said anything about an electroshock story , so idk where this is even coming from . are you confusing me with someone else ? ?","307307":"lol , i highly doubt it . you can certainly google this question , though .","307308":"it has nothing to do with bravery . i m brave because i ve endured a lot throughout my life , but i m very insecure about my body and hate full body pictures of myself .","307309":"i only hug people i m close with . otherwise it s uncomfortable to me .","307310":"yeah , i do swear a lot during the course of the day , lol .","307311":"that doesn t sound like it s my problem .","307312":"look up mike pence because he s worse than trump is .","307313":"trump shouldn t be impeached solely because his successors are even worse than he is . we would be putting this country in more peril if he gets impeached . i disagree with most forms of self diagnosis when it comes to mental illness except for obvious disorders like depression and anxiety . if you have the ability to see a doctor then just see one and get a psych evaluation . the biggest problem is that people with self diagnosed complex mental illnesses infiltrate communities they don t belong in . new wave feminism is a bit of a joke , and while i m obviously all for women s rights , i think the new feminism movement focuses more on insignificant things instead of more important dilemmas in other countries like human trafficking , fgm , child marriages , etc etc .","307314":"it s literally a symptom of my mental illness , lol . but like i said , it s something i m continuously working on because i know it isn t healthy .","307315":"uh , i ve been with my boyfriend for eight years . i m pretty sure i know . lol .","307316":"rofl what kind of question is this . i m not talking about my boyfriend s penis on askfm .","307317":"i ve realized over the course of the past few months that i m a pretty jealous person , which makes my bpd come out more . if a friend is hanging out with someone else and doesn t invite me if i m friends with both of them , then i feel pretty excluded and jealous . i know it isn t a healthy feeling to have and i ve been trying to work on it .","307318":"i m hot sticky tired . i just got home from work and i m drinking an iced coffee . i m going to head to my boyfriend s house in about an hour and hang out . i m excited to cool off with his ac and a spiked seltzer .","307319":"no , i don t believe in love at first sight . if you re attracted to someone upon first meeting them , then it s infatuation . part of it also has to do with you projecting your desires onto that person and seeing all of their positive attributes that correspond with your own , as well . you don t actually fall in love with someone until you know them personally on an intimate level . and that takes quite a few meet ups to actually happen .","307320":"no humidity . oh my god . the humidity is absolutely wild where i live because we re surrounded by water , so it always feels degrees hotter than it actually is it s hard to breathe outside . i would much rather take a hotter temperature with no humidity whatsoever .","307321":"it isn t boring if you re with the right person ! ! my boyfriend i have never gotten tired of each other and we always have things to discuss .","307322":"yeah , plenty of my friends have different views than me . you can t expect your friends to be replicas of yourself , that s just unrealistic .","307323":"no , i ve never seen it before .","307324":"too much , rofl . i check it on my breaks at work and then i ll check it whenever i get a new question when i m home .","307325":"nah , i ve always enjoyed ncis . however , the episodes of criminal minds i ve been watching have sorta been rubbing me the wrong way . they re basically demonizing people with did and i m not here for it .","307326":"i m from the united states .","307327":"someone keeps asking me how old i was , how it felt , and how many times i ve been sxxually assaulted . it s incredibly invasive .","307328":"if the officer didn t ask you to step out of the vehicle , then you should stay in the car until further instruction .","307329":"i m probably not going to sleep anytime soon , so yeah .","307330":"not really . i ve been feeling pretty depressed all day for a number of reasons . i ve basically been laying in bed for the past six hours doing absolutely nothing . i hate when this happens to me .","307331":"not that i m aware of . i don t exactly have much exposure on askfm .","307332":"confront them stand up for yourself . if you re not an easy target then they ll find someone else to pick on who may be too afraid to say something .","307333":"of course . i m sure there are dozens of chefs who are proficient at cooking food outside of their culture .","307334":"burgers are an american oriented food , but that doesn t mean they re every american s favorite food . or even that every american likes or eats burgers to begin with .","307335":"lmao , jesus if this ain t the epitome of a stereotype .","307336":"yeah ! ! my job writes using ap style and they don t use the oxford comma it drives me up the wall , lol .","307337":"i m not patriotic , so there s nothing for me to celebrate . also , none of my friends invited me to any festivities so i ve just been sitting at home watching tv , rofl .","307338":"it s difficult to read but i couldn t care less about how people type .","307339":"no . i ve been a department supervisor , but never a store manager or someone in charge of hiring employees .","307340":"like i said before , the only thing you can do is keep trying . you ll find one eventually and it s fine to be frustrated , but you can t let it discourage you from finding a job .","307341":"i don t really have any pet peeves because i don t care about other people s grammar . however , ap style doesn t use the oxford comma which took me a long time to get used to .","307342":"i enjoy veggie burgers , but they re not my favorite food . i just tried boca burgers recently they were really good ! !","307343":"it s always the double edged sword when it comes to finding a job , especially if you have no prior experience . it s a little ridiculous that some companies won t give people with no prior job a chance , because how else is that person going to gain experience ? ? the only other place you can go is retail , when it comes to having no other jobs . there are a lot of retail stores that will hire first timers .","307344":"i live with my parents so i don t pay the mortgage or anything . however , i do contribute to the food that enters the house .","307345":"good bras support breasts in terms of holding them up keeping them secure . good friends are supposed to support their friends emotionally and keep them afloat .","307346":"i ve taken puffs of my friends vapes , but i don t own one myself . i ve been thinking about buying a juul so i can cut down on smoking cigarettes , though .","307347":"abandonment .","307348":"these days , i would walk away . i don t exhibit much pride because i m more humble than proud i m not keen on putting myself into dangerous situations anymore . if you asked me this question five years ago , though , i would have continued doing whatever it is i was doing . i was too proud and arrogant to be afraid of death i welcomed it with open arms .","307349":"do you mean csi ? ? i ve seen a few episodes here and there but i ve never sat down and watched it . i remember an old forensics teacher who showed my class a few episodes pointed out everything that was wrong .","307350":"i m pretty easy going . i prefer to talk about music , writing , video games , mental health , art , fitness , coffee , tv shows movies , true crime , etc etc . although i ll answer anything as long as the questions aren t sxxual .","307351":"probably the one with the added frother and glass carafe ! !","307352":"uh , i mean not personally lol . i had a dog when i was younger that my family had to put down , though . she had cancerous tumors in her stomach and couldn t eat or drink water or move . it was terrible i felt so bad , but she was in so much pain and discomfort .","307353":"no , i don t listen to any podcasts . i used to watch the rooster teeth podcast a few years ago but i stopped watching it . not for any particular reason , i just became distant from the community .","307354":"yes ! ! but honestly , it doesn t seem to make my coffee strong enough . i want a ninja coffee bar but they re hella expensive .","307355":"just a psa for the fourth of july ! !","307356":"i ve seen men cry all the time . there s nothing wrong with men crying and sometimes there doesn t need to be a story behind their tears . crying is a natural human reaction that happens to everyone regardless of their gender . the idea that seeing a man cry is still taboo in this age is ridiculous .","307357":"then that s a conversation you need to have with your partner . if you re unhappy with your intimate life then you need to communicate that with your partner , as hard as it might be . excess masturbation is only a problem if it causes issues in your personal or professional lives . if your behavior is causing a rift between yourself and your partner then that s something you need to change .","307358":"of course it is . it s a completely natural and healthy act and there s nothing wrong with it .","307359":"society , the media , parents , friends , etc etc . males have been taught for centuries that they re supposed to be the stronger or more superior sex compared to females and a lot of that is tied into the physical act of having sex .","307360":"i think males are conditioned from an early age to equate sex with attention and respect , while its different for females , who are taught that you should only have sex with someone you love . there s a higher pressure on males to have sex and lose their virginity because of hypermasculinity , and that s automatically geared toward heterosexual males . a lot of their lives revolve around sex and that s instilled in them from an early age .","307361":"depends on the teacher it also depends on whether you re talking about high school or college . most of my college professors delved right into work the first class because they re only allowed a limited number of classes per semester .","307362":"it s understandable to be nervous ! ! i was nervous my first year of college too . however , you re typically given a lot of freedom you ll get used to it rather quickly . good luck ! !","307363":"i don t like her music i m pretty sure she s been problematic in the past i m pretty sure she forced a minor to kiss her during a concert ? .","307364":"i drive a hyundai accent .","307365":"yeah , i actually just met mike shinoda a few weeks ago ! ! it was one of the best experiences of my life .","307366":"no , i don t believe in any of those . i m not religious or spiritual by any means .","307367":"i ve been debating on buying a new band for my fitbit but i can t justify spending on it , even though i m going to wear it every day .","307368":"i m not entirely sure . it s one of those things i m constantly debating in my mind .","307369":"he couldn t hold food down and kept on vomiting . there s been a rodent problem in the area so we thought that maybe he got a rat borne or a tick borne disease since that would account for his symptoms . they ran all of the necessary tests and took x rays just in case , but thankfully everything came up negative . they gave him a strong dose of anti nausea medication and fluids to rehydrate him , and he s been ok since then ! !","307370":"yikes , i didn t realize up until this point that i was talking to a child . idk how you found me , but you can kindly leave my page now . i don t converse with children .","307371":"? ? ? if you were never rejected , then logically you wouldn t have the desire to try to hit on people via the internet . by that logic , you would likely be in a relationship have no reason to be even having this conversation . your insecurities are still showing , though . and that s perfectly okay ! ! just don t be a d ck about it .","307372":"rofl . my man , if you were really that perfect then you wouldn t be vying for a complete stranger s attention anonymously on the internet . you re showing all of the telltale signs of insecurity , probably from being rejected often . instead of exuding false confidence , just be yourself .","307373":"uh , yes and no . saturday started out fine , but then i had to rush my boyfriend his dog to the emergency hour vet clinic because his dog was violently sick . we didn t get home until am his dog is ok now . sunday was exhausting because all of my boyfriend s little cousins came over and they were there from pm until pm . it was fun seeing them , but looking after six children while the parents talk is exhausting .","307374":"i have a few great memories , yeah ! ! was the year of my best friend s wedding , and my birthday last year was actually quite enjoyable . i also got a few tattoos . however , was also bittersweet . there was a lot of tragedy and loss , which in a way makes the good moments seem richer because you appreciate them more .","307375":"hell no . i m too over emotional , unstable , impulsive , and angry . i have no idea how or why my boyfriend puts up with me or what he even finds alluring about me at all .","307376":"most of the time , zero . i haven t had the time or energy to watch tv lately . when i am in the mood to watch something , i ll usually watch episodes for longer shows or episodes for shorter shows .","307377":"hell no . i typically pick tv shows that have a lot of episodes and a lot of seasons so that it keeps me occupied for a while . i was watching the x files for a few months , but then i stopped for a while . even though i was watching it for months , i m still only maybe halfway through the series , lol .","307378":"student loans , considering they re my biggest loan my most expensive bill each month . i loved learning new things while in college . . . but at what price ? ? i m going to be paying back these loans until i die .","307379":"coffee , alcohol , music . whenever those three things are nearby , they have my undivided attention .","307380":"i m not saying it s not real , but i definitely thought quicksand was going to be a hell of a lot more threatening and commonplace than it actually is . lmao .","307381":"or if you did it would have been your fault not mine lmfao i m howlinggggg . buddy . . . please go bother someone else .","307382":"i m exhausted . this has been a rough weekend and i m ready to sleep for the next hours . i still have almost two hours left of work i m so distracted . i just want the day to end .","307383":"i m not a tattoo artist so i can t make tattoos . regardless , getting someone s name tattooed on you is reckless , unless it s the name of your child or something . i know a lot of people who got their partner s name tattooed on them then felt really dumb when they broke up .","307384":"i ve had dreams about some of my online friends at times too , lol . it isn t uncommon .","307385":"i don t know a single thing about the world cup .","307386":"i don t generally lie to people , so i personally don t know . i have nothing to lie about in my life .","307387":"netflix is absolutely worth the subscription . they have an amazing array of tv shows movies .","307388":"haha , well thank you","307389":"no , they shouldn t be banned . i think they shouldn t be used during class should be kept on silent , but i also think they re good in case of emergencies .","307390":"i use vegan alternatives whenever i can , and i do love vegan food because it tastes so much better than typical meat and dairy products . i had a boca burger for the first time the other day it was delicious .","307391":"sounds a little judgmental . everyone will have physical imperfections because we re only human , but that doesn t mean we can t also see their perfections or things that make them unique .","307392":"aw , thank you ! !","307393":"if you have a problem with me , you can clearly unfollow block me . no use in telling me to stop talking on my own page if you re not going to do anything about it .","307394":"my boyfriend is definitely more hot headed than i am . he gets angry and frustrated pretty frequently , but he fortunately deals with his anger in constructive manners so it isn t detrimental to his health . i have a tendency to be hot headed at times , but only if certain people get under my skin . normally i m fine , but if one of those people really get to me , then i go into fits of rage and make stupid , reckless decisions .","307395":"according to my canadian friends , apparently canada isn t that much better than the united states ? ? i don t know enough about canada to really make a decision , though . i would certainly like the weather more , at any rate ! !","307396":"i m more like my father in terms of personality . we re both academically oriented and think logically as opposed to emotionally although i admit that i think more with my heart at times . we also both struggle with anxiety .","307397":"uh . . . no ? ?","307398":"hello do you have a question ? ?","307399":"lately i ve been having salads with spinach , diced tomatoes , lettuce , shaved carrots , parmesan , and a small amount of pasta .","307400":"i think it s gross , but people are entitled to their fetishes . just don t push them onto me , which unfortunately happens a lot of askfm .","307401":"studies have shown that flying is actually the safest mode of transportation because it has the least percentage of deaths when compared to other means of transportation , i . e . driving , riding a motorcycle , taking the train , etc .","307402":"my day is good , so far . it s only am and i ve only been awake for minutes , though . i m currently drinking iced coffee catching up on my questions , and when i m done , i m going to continue working on some freelance assignments . i m hoping to get everything done by this afternoon , since i m going to have a busy day tomorrow won t be able to work on anything .","307403":"i ll try to recommend some different people this time around , since i notice i always the same few people ! ! country peach perfectionistgirl livibates origamibirds urlsareshittbh they all give really interesting and in depth answers .","307404":"don t settle for anything less than what you deserve . your feelings are valid . i support you .","307405":"during the summers , it s between degrees fahrenheit , and during the winter , it goes between degrees fahrenheit . this week is supposed to be actually , and i m not looking forward to it . i do believe in global warming that s why temperatures have been extreme these past few years .","307406":"i have this one friend whom i made online when i was years old . i was a member of a linkin park message board and we clicked immediately , and i would look forward to coming home from school talking to her on aol instant messenger every day . she was probably one of my closest friends during a really tumultuous time of my life .","307407":"there s no such thing as having enough money .","307408":"height doesn t mean anything in terms of relationships . if you re interested in a person , then you like them for who they are , not for how tall or short they are . if a woman is taller than a man , then it makes zero difference .","307409":"i occasionally post photos of me smoking cigarettes on askfm , but every time i do , i get hounded by anons claiming that i m encouraging children to smoke , lol . i don t post photos of me drinking alcohol anywhere , though . occasionally i ll post a picture of my beer to my insta story , but that s it . i don t think it has a positive or negative influence on the people who are old enough to use social media sites , such as askfm . at that point , they re old enough to know that smoking cigarettes is unhealthy for you and drinking underage isn t cool so it doesn t make much of a difference . if a teenager wants to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol , then a picture of me smoking a cigarette isn t going to be the tipping point .","307410":"i appreciate the compliment . however , my bio indicates that i m not a girl and i would also appreciate it if you didn t refer to me as a girl anymore .","307411":"i guess you ignored the part of my answer where i said that a significant portion of people who sell content are doing so while attending college . like i said , that s your opinion . i find that people are sexier when they re doing something they re passionate about and have adequate support from friends or family .","307412":"my age is clearly listed in my bio . i m years old . why am i getting all of the foreign anons today ? ? this is bizarre .","307413":"i disagree with your opinion , and i realize there s unfortunately nothing i can do to change your mind since people of your stature are usually set in their ways .","307414":"that s disrespectful toward people who sell videos pictures to make money , including sxx workers and strippers . they re just as deserving of respect as people who have other jobs . in addition , selling content doesn t automatically make a person less intelligent than someone who doesn t sell content . often , people are attending college to obtain degrees and sell content on the side .","307415":"? ? ? i wasn t implying that i was sad , i was just stating that i have no interest in learning about egypt

my teeth .","307419":"i don t find myself attractive , so i wouldn t feel comfortable putting myself out there . besides , that s why i m working on the weekends . cc courrtana","307420":"i don t think children should be drinking or smoking marijuana under the age of . it hinders their development otherwise . however , i would definitely talk to my children about the risks of doing those kinds of behaviors underage and give them the proper tools they need if they wanted to do it against my wishes . it s better for them to be safe while doing it than to ignore the problem entirely .","307421":"if someone has a shirt on that says something negative about gay people , you re damn right i m going to judge them .","307422":"yes . . . global warming is a real threat .","307423":"you click the three dots and hit block .","307424":"sometimes , yeah especially if i m feeling isolated or lonely . however , i have to remind myself that the friendship ended for a reason and i can t be sucked back into a toxic environment . even if i miss the friendship , i m not going to put myself back in that situation . it isn t healthy .","307425":"yes , it absolutely makes sense ! ! creating art is a healthy coping mechanism for mental health issues .","307426":"i highly doubt that a woman will purposely put their feet in agony just to do something as pointless as impress a man . some people have told me that they love high heels , but i never understood the appeal .","307427":"there is an issue with people coming to the us illegally , but i don t believe in tearing innocent families apart and placing children in detention centers due to immigration issues . that s just inhumane .","307428":"pretty much , yeah . the media tends to glamorize certain things or portray them in a particular light , but the facts are all still there .","307429":"i m assuming my boyfriend , if he s even alive at that point . this is also assuming i m alive at that point too .","307430":"yin yang bass clef this was my first tattoo i wanted something to represent the duality of music and how it s balancing to me . roses half sleeve i honestly just wanted something with flowers with the phrase love conquers all around them . om symbol this was a tattoo i got with my best friend , she got one on her foot . it s symbolic of our friendship . wolf moon there s no hidden meaning behind it , i ve just always loved wolves and i love the moon . coffee cup pretty self explanatory . i m addicted to coffee , lol . avocado this is a matching tattoo i got with my best friend . she got the half with the pit in it . basically another tattoo that symbolizes our friendship all of the sh t we ve endured together . linkin park symbol this is probably my most meaningful tattoo because they ve helped me substantially throughout my life even saved my life at one point . i owe them everything .","307431":"lmao , no . i don t need people worrying about me more than they already do .","307432":"no . women and men are equally as complex . humans in general are complicated creatures with a vast array of emotions .","307433":"you cannot judge a person merely by how they look just because a person looks a particular way doesn t mean that it defines their personality , their interests , their relationship status , their opinions , etc etc . people are more than just physical appearances .","307434":"focus your attention elsewhere whether it s through seeing friends family , delving into hobbies , exercising , etc etc . you shouldn t be defined by a person and you have to remember that you were your own individual prior to meeting and dating them as well . things will get easier with time .","307435":"i would advise against asking questions such as these in the future , as they may cause some individuals to dissociate or experience psychotic symptoms . if i start thinking too much about reality vs fantasy , i tend to dissociate badly and it lasts for the rest of the day . it isn t healthy for me to think so deeply about such concepts .","307436":"i saw headlines about this but i didn t watch the video at all . i think that s amazing , though . animals are so much smarter than humans give them credit for . i haven t witnessed any animals doing anything amazing , but i love the new videos that have been surfacing lately , where the owner hides behind a sheet and disappears , and their dog looks wildly around for them . i think it s hilarious .","307437":"yes , beauty is entirely subjective . everyone has a different concept of what s beautiful that s individualized to them and their tastes .","307438":"i ve actually never gone camping before . i ve always wanted to go , but it just hasn t happened yet since my boyfriend and i seldom get the same days off it s difficult for him to request days off from work . i think i would wholeheartedly enjoy it , though . it would be nice to disconnect and be surrounded by nature for a while .","307439":"no , i ve never been on a dating site before . i ve been dating my boyfriend since before dating sites apps were really prominent , lol . i ve heard good things about plentyoffish and okcupid , though . i know quite a few people who have found partners through those sites .","307440":"i m sorry you had to go through that ordeal . pets are members of the family , and it s always difficult to have to put a pet down . i used to have a german shepard when i was younger , and as she got older , she developed a lot of tumors . it got to the point where she didn t eat or move anymore , so we had no choice but to put her down . it was a really sad moment of my life .","307441":"lol . those types of shows are largely ineffective . either way , my behavior wouldn t have qualified me to be on that show because my actions were minor .","307442":"absolutely not . having a mental illness doesn t excuse you from being a troll or an a shole . you still know the difference between right wrong behavior .","307443":"this isn t exactly a question . . . my life wouldn t be any different . marriage doesn t mean much to me .","307444":"here s the sunset from last night , which contain some of my favorite combination of colors","307445":"trans women are still women , so technically they re heterosexual because they re only attracted to one gender . however , i think that debate comes from a lot of homophobia still because it insinuates that being gay or bi is a bad thing to be .","307446":"i don t think the orientation itself changes i . e . what gender or sex you find attractive or unattractive , but as you get older , you start to discover more things about yourself and come to realizations regarding your sexual orientation . for example , i used to consider myself pansexual but as i ve gotten older , i ve realized bisexual fits me more . i ve always identified with bisexual more but there used to be such a stigma regarding bi individuals that i didn t want to be associated with that years ago .","307447":"lol , good . i m sarcastic on here sometimes a lot of people take me seriously .","307448":"i ll jot that down in my list of things that anons tell me that they think i m not aware of .","307449":"i don t think it s horrible it s realistic , and there s nothing wrong with knowing that you re fat . as long as we re taking the steps to better our health .","307450":"it s thunderstorming and raining outside rn , i fucking love it .","307451":"it depends on the individual . some people are closer to their mothers while others are closer to their fathers . some aren t close to either parent , while some are equally close to both of their parents .","307452":"i don t feel fat , i am fat . lol .","307453":"boo fuckin hoo .","307454":"i m literally smoking a cigarette in my profile picture .","307455":"there are actually some sources that confirm that having casual sxx may lead to disruptions in mental health , especially in terms of depression loneliness . i think it generally goes on an individual basis , though . i know some people whose sxxual encounters have resulted in a worsening of mood behavior , while for other people , it provided an outlet and didn t affect their health at all . it s all about moderation .","307456":"neither is judging other people for their behavior that has zero effect on your life . let people live their lives the way they want to live them . if you re bothered by it , then don t have a one night stand yourself . that s all you can do .","307457":"rofl . no , i have no interest in being with anyone besides my boyfriend .","307458":"other people s sxxual escapades don t affect your life , though . who cares if some people have one night stands or multiple partners ? ? it s consensual behavior and they have the freedom to express their sxxuality however they wish .","307459":"no , i never have before . it was never something that interested me .","307460":"i m usually the one who controls the music since the driver isn t supposed to be on the phone while driving . the only person with whom i take long trips , though , is my boyfriend . so we usually have a conversation the entire way there .","307461":"so i just finished up my walk , and i got my best time yet ! ! i know it isn t much to be proud of , but i walked a mile in minutes . that s a big improvement from a few weeks ago , when i used to walk a mile in minutes . today s been a good productive day ! !","307462":"about minutes ago when i finished up my walk , lol . my calves were hurting because i was trying to walk faster than my usual pace , so it felt nice to finish up and sit down for five minutes .","307463":"eh , not really . i haven t been paying much attention to the news at all . i see snippets of headlines here there , but i haven t read a news article in a few weeks .","307464":"i m eating more vegetables and protein . i m also cutting out a lot of carbs although some can t be avoided , unfortunately . instead of whole milk , i m using soy and coconut milk in my coffee . i m using sugar alternatives , i . e . truvia . etc etc . i m just making healthier choices compared to how i used to eat .","307465":"i don t even know if i want children to begin with . either way , i m not going to have children when i m not ready to have children in the first place . that s just unfair to the child .","307466":"i haven t had either in a very long time , lol . i honestly don t remember which one i preferred .","307467":"there s a difference between personal mental health issues being good at academia . school simply came easily to me .","307468":"everyone has their fantasies , but it all depends on whether or not they re going to act out on those fantasies . it s completely normal for you to feel wary , but if you re actually scared of your boyfriend because of this , then you need to have a conversation about your feelings and set guidelines and boundaries . i don t know if i would consider it to be a red flag unless he has fantasies about literal abvse or anything along those lines . . . but follow your gut instinct .","307469":"no , there s really no such thing as too much caffeine for me , lol .","307470":"no , i m just planning on working and making money . however , i do go out with my friends occasionally too .","307471":"no , not generally . it s the only genre that i don t listen to .","307472":"during the summer , i prefer iced coffee . however , during the winter , i only drink hot coffee . i like vanilla hazelnut the most . although lately i ve been getting my coffee with sugar free cinnamon dolce syrup .","307473":"obviously it s a thing if you just confirmed that it exists .","307474":"i don t exactly know what you mean by reversed nature .","307475":"i guess i do in a certain way , lol . i always wear flannels and skinny jeans with combat boots , and during the winter , i wear beanies . however , i ve never had blue hair if i was able to find her staple white tank top and necklaces , i think i would pull it off pretty well .","307476":"i ve always wanted to cosplay chloe price from the life is strange video games ! ! i ve honestly just always been able to relate to her i ve always loved her character . i also think she would be relatively easy to cosplay , which would be good for me since i ve never cosplayed before .","307477":"yeah , of course . i m polite to everyone until they give me a reason not to be polite anymore . if someone was attacking me because of my viewpoints , then that would be a just cause for me to be stern with them .","307478":"this question is actually quite controversial because there s a lot of debate over whether it should be considered a standalone diagnosis or merely a symptom of an underlying disorder .","307479":"https youtu . be gozujxstizs rofl . it s an s remix of numb by linkin park . i sent it to my best friend .","307480":"i just drank a oz iced coffee i m wired . should i try to play video games , continue bullsh tting on my laptop , or try to get some freelance work done ? ? so many choices . so much caffeine .","307481":"if that was my child my boyfriend and i were standing there witnessing this , that priest would have had a right hook straight to the jaw . it isn t a stranger s obligation to discipline a child that isn t their own especially a baby . babies don t know why they re being hit , so it s so detrimental to their well being . that priest was behaving completely out of line .","307482":"y i k e s i don t appreciate these sorts of inquiries . i m happily in a relationship have no intention of seeing anyone else .","307483":"my day was fine . i m still dealing with the after effects of my mental breakdown earlier this week so i ve been exhausted , but my day itself wasn t bad and i ve been able to keep control of my emotions today . i m actually looking forward to tomorrow because my job is having a bagel breakfast i absolutely love bagels , rofl .","307484":"haha , no . i was never interested in math .","307485":"i don t eat at mcdonalds . if someone is going there asks me what i want , i ll usually just order a coffee or an oreo mcflurry .","307486":"it depends on who the person is , what they ve done to wrong me , if they were apologetic for their actions , etc etc . sometimes my grudges only last a few days weeks , while other times it lasts months .","307487":"eventually , sure . i don t plan on smoking for the rest of my life .","307488":"it can be in some aspects if you allow yourself to be so sleep deprived that it causes detrimental effects to your body and mind . not getting enough sleep can actually cause death and further exacerbate mental health problems , including an increased risk of giving into other forms of self h rm or having a breakdown .","307489":"i m sure we ll get married eventually , but it isn t a priority right now .","307490":"when you re not married , you have a boyfriend girlfriend . when you re married , you have a husband wife .","307491":"hello do you have a question ? ?","307492":"you mean television series ? ? i prefer tv shows . they re shorter and hold my attention more , and it s easier to binge watch tv shows than movies .","307493":"i don t know anymore . perhaps three at the most .","307494":"yess , that s probably my favorite song off of the album . i can relate to it so much , especially lately . i had a really bad night last night , and i was basically playing it on repeat .","307495":"i believe that was one of the first songs he wrote after chester passed . i cried the first few times i heard it .","307496":"yes , i do . like i stated in an earlier answer , i bounce around a lot when it comes to things i enjoy , particularly music . i become obsessive over certain things , and then i quickly lose interest in them to focus my attention elsewhere .","307497":"it honestly was he s such a chill , down to earth guy that he instantly made me feel comfortable and i surprisingly wasn t anxious or nervous at all . the only thing that made my nervous was deciding on what to tell him when i met him because i was afraid i was going to not be able to say anything at all when i got to the signing booth , lol . but i managed to give him my letter ! ! ! and tell him thank you , and he was genuinely thankful and appreciative . he s one of the nicest guys i ve ever met .","307498":"you definitely should when you have the time ! ! it s a great album , i ve had it on repeat since i got the cd on monday . i recommend running from my shadow , i . o . u . , and hold it together . those are my jams right now .","307499":"hey friends , my inbox is empty . does anyone have any questions ? ?","307500":"cell phone , car loan , car insurance , and student loan .","307501":"i think he s both tbh he s exhibited racist tendencies , and he also thinks that people like him are superior to others who are less fortunate without regard for their shortcomings or struggles .","307502":"uh , no ? ? i d also be telling his wife rofllll .","307503":"i m sorry that you haven t experienced what it s like to finally meet your role model .","307504":"i m not concerned about the pain because i don t even know if i want children .","307505":". . . i literally just said who .","307506":"aaahh , thank you ! ! i m a little nervous because my best friend might be getting out of work late , and i m terrified we won t be able to get there on time , though .","307507":"i m meeting mike shinoda today , i can t contain my excitement .","307508":"traveled to austin , texas , for a video game convention with my boyfriend . i got to meet a few of my idols and hang out with really cool cosplayers .","307509":"i don t really eat food out of enjoyment , for the most part . however , i do really enjoy eggs and sushi not together , lol .","307510":"in general , you re right . however , if that speech is oppressive and inappropriate , then it s good for a website to be vigilant of those messages and get rid of them , especially considering there are children on this website .","307511":"that makes sense ! ! it s good that they re starting to do that , if that s the case .","307512":"exactly my point . tbh i feel as if i continuously get the same few anons who want to try to prove me wrong or challenge my statements , but then they ultimately get frustrated when i don t respond the way they expect me to , haha .","307513":"it obviously matters to the lgbt community because it raises a question about his credibility . in any regard , your bizarre analogy regarding your grandmother is a fallacy and makes absolutely zero sense . i m not going to entertain this any longer because it s getting wild , lol .","307514":"we already went over this . you can think i m lying all you want , but the truth is that he contradicts his own statements . just because you think he was pro gay marriage the second he was sworn in doesn t mean that he didn t spend a majority of his campaign against gay marriage .","307515":"i would imagine so . i haven t visited the city in a long time , though .","307516":"don t get your panties in a twist , my dude . i m just saying his opinions often contradict themselves . it isn t anything new .","307517":"that s honestly up for debate because his opinions regarding gay marriage have always flip flopped with time , rofl . during the presidential campaign , he made a lot of contradicting statements , first saying that he preferred traditional marriage and opposed same sex marriage , and then eventually saying that his opinion was irrelevant because the debate was settled .","307518":"i m in support of gay marriage . people should be allowed to marry whoever they want regardless of their sexual orientation , sex , or gender .","307519":"i m talking about actual businesses and corporations , my dude . especially in regards to businesses that have customers , i . e . retail positions or food service industries . being an actor doesn t exactly fit that mold . obviously if someone is homophobic and doesn t want to play a gay character , that s their decision .","307520":"your answer looks like it got cut off . either way , it sounds as if we re simply misunderstanding each other . i don t believe that people should be able to refuse business to others based on their race , sex , gender , sexual orientation , religion , etc etc . like my other anon said , if a person is being hostile and becomes a threat to the business , then yes , that s a valid reason to refuse service . but you shouldn t be able to refuse service to a person based entirely on a bias you hold against an entire group of people .","307521":"lol , it s honestly a strange question to ask because you should be at the age where you know whether or not your body gives off signs prior to getting a period . that s the only reason why i doubted that it was a legitimate question since everyone s bodies are different .","307522":"the supreme court ruled in favor of the baker , in that particular instance . however , i personally believe that it shouldn t matter whether someone buying a cake is straight or gay . the person is a consumer who wishes to invest in your product , and their sexual orientation doesn t affect the money coming out of their wallet .","307523":"obviously i think it was disgusting how one of their management heads said statements opposing gay marriage , and i think it was justifiable how people responded to the controversy through boycotts and refusing to allow stores to open in certain cities .","307524":"right now , i m getting paid to sit at my laptop in sweatpants and a ratty tank top while drinking a large iced coffee and listening to the skyrim soundtrack in my own bedroom . freelance work is friggin awesome , my dudes .","307525":"scrambled eggs with spinach or a spinach salad with bacon bits , mushrooms , and mozzarella cheese .","307526":"tbh i just want to be content with who i am , where i am , etc etc . i have a lot of goals and ambitions , though , so i m motivated to get myself to a place where i m truly comfortable with myself and my environment .","307527":"yeah , it does especially if i m around a group of people . i always need time alone to unwind after i ve been out and there are a lot of people around . if i m around one or two people maximum , then i m usually okay , though .","307528":"wow , that sounds amazing ! ! i definitely think more people should utilize such a thing because it sounds as if it can be extremely helpful , especially in the case of mental health if a person feels as if they have no one to relate to or no one cares about their issues .","307529":"tbh i never have anyone over my house so this question doesn t really apply to me . . . however , i personally don t care if someone walks into my house with shoes on as long as they re not completely filthy . i always walk around with no shoes on , i just hate how constricting shoes can be .","307530":"lol , i m one of those idiots who lay out in the sun until my skin turns beat red . i love having a tan , even though lately it s been really hard for me to actually tan probably because i m inside so often these days . i miss going to the beach , though . it was always so much fun to lay there , chain smoke , have a beer , and bullshit for the day .","307531":"positives i legitimately enjoy what i do i can listen to music while i work my coworkers are chill af they just recently gave me the option to do freelance work , so i ll be making extra income on top of my salary negatives the commute is long and exhausting there s never any parking in the lot there s a high turnover rate , which makes me paranoid that they re going to fire me without warning one day","307532":"i m bisexual non binary , so i m all about pride month ! ! i don t usually go to parades or anything , but i do like to raise awareness of lgbt issues during pride month .","307533":"that makes sense . i ve obviously always known that credit exists and that there are good and bad credit scores and that determines a variety of things such as mortgage payments and other big loans . however , i think it s sad that i was never actually taught what credit was , where it comes from , how it works , etc etc . it would have been beneficial to have been taught it in school i m sure some schools do , but mine definitely didn t .","307534":"this is true too ! ! granted you consistently make the payments on time , haha . i m lucky in that my car expenses and other bills have given me pretty good credit because i ve never missed a payment thus far .","307535":"aw , lol . i m not that smart , i ve just owned quite a few cars at this point in my life ! ! although my current car is the only new car i ve purchased , so all i really did was give a down payment and set up a monthly payment plan . good luck , though ! !","307536":"i ve personally never had the kind of money to drop all of my life savings on a car in one purchase , lol . i have monthly payments , like i m sure of the rest of the population with cars do as well . i can t imagine what would happen if the car is totaled , though . that seems like you wouldn t be able to get the money back compared to someone who was , for example , only halfway done with paying the car off .","307537":"when people talk over me when i m in the middle of speaking . when people chew with their mouths open or talk with their mouth full of food . when people insist on cutting me off and then proceed to drive mph down the highway . when people ignore texts instead of saying no if i ask them to hang out .","307538":"i don t have expensive tastes at all , considering i don t even indulge myself in expensive items since i can t afford them . i wouldn t consider myself to have much of a taste of anything since i m not very picky to begin with . i guess . . . i would have cheap tastes ? ? lol .","307539":"french fries ice cream ! ! don t me , courrtana . you won t understand .","307540":"no , lol . you re talking about kids in high school . they just questioned authority and the teachers opinions a lot and didn t follow their advice obediently like most other people did .","307541":"best mike shinoda meet n greet passes various vacations tattoos worst various items for my family as gifts that they ve never used","307542":"depends on who you re buying the gift for and what they like .","307543":"given the right amount of time has passed and circumstances , i believe so . however , they would have to be wary of the same situation happening again . there s a reason why people have falling outs a majority of the time , and if the circumstances or people involved haven t changed , then the same thing is doomed to happen again .","307544":"lol , parks rec reference ! ! treating myself means that i allowed myself to enjoy something after doing something particularly strenuous as a means of comfort . right now , i have no reason to treat myself . but i will tonight after i go to the gym , so i ll probably make a cup of coffee or tea when i get home .","307545":"about a month or so after my boyfriend bought me an ipad , i accidentally broke the screen , lmao . i was horrified but it still worked , thankfully . it was only a crack on the corner of the screen so i was still able to use it .","307546":"there s really no way around it . you can tell someone you need some distance , however , and hope they respond favorably . however , blatantly ignoring someone can be hurtful in most instances .","307547":"absolutely not . there s no excuse for physically abvsing your partner regardless of whether or not they ve been raised in an abvsive household . they re old enough to understand the difference between right and wrong .","307548":"i was speaking in the context of askfm regarding shehitsback . obviously i know that some people lie about their age but there s no benefit to doing so on askfm .","307549":"not at all . there s literally no reason to lie about your age , lol . she s a very open honest person . cc shehitsback","307550":"lol . it s been so long . story time i used to play fallout religiously when it first came out , and even after taking breaks to play multiple other games , it was one of the few games i would always come back to . i got back into playing it a few months ago because i felt like making a new character and playing a few mods , which jumpstarted my obsession all over again . well . i downloaded a few mods and my game kept crashing . i uninstalled the mods , and the game still crashed . i did a hard reboot , uninstalled the game , and reinstalled the game and it still crashes . there s no predictability over when it s going to crash , but it s made me almost throw my controller a few times because it s just so frustrating . tl dr i haven t played fallout in a long time because it crashes every time i play , so fml .","307551":"not at all . crying is a natural human reaction to stressors , it doesn t determine whether someone is weak or strong . crying also releases endorphins which is why you usually feel a bit more relieved after you ve cried over something .","307552":"pros lightweight airy comfortable af matches any outfit cons literally none .

.","307555":"yeah , i think it s hilarious .","307556":"lmao . first off if i like an answer that morgan posts it means i agree with her . second off she s completely right . it isn t up to the child whether or not they should go on a trip , that decision is left up to the parents . if a parent doesn t want their child attending a trip for whatever reason , then that s the final decision .","307557":"for the most part , mental health isn t taken as seriously as physical health and a lot of people still see mental illness as a weakness of character instead of an actual illness . it isn t so much taboo anymore considering recent events over the past year regarding celebrities , but it still isn t fully accepted .","307558":"it s understandable to be nervous about starting therapy i was afraid nervous too prior to starting myself . in the beginning , she basically asked me why i sought therapy and asked me a little bit about my life . we talked about the things that were bothering me or holding me back and she made it abundantly clear that her office was a safe place and i don t have to talk about anything that i was uncomfortable talking about . we talked a lot about my past and how it affects the present day , especially my behavior and how i think about myself . lately we ve been talking about the things i think and experience week by week and go from there .","307559":"my therapist has told me that it s perfectly okay to distance myself from things or people who don t serve my happiness in life . if something someone does not serve me , it s natural to not associate with it them because first and foremost , i should preserve my own well being .","307560":"right now , the few things that have kept me optimistic are my relationship with my boyfriend , my motivation to continue eating healthy working out , the freelance work i m about to start this week , and meeting mike shinoda next week .","307561":"lmao , it s pretty much guaranteed that there s at least one florida headline that s completely weird bizarre . i . e . , i just looked up florida news in google news and found the headline , alligator moves florida couple s patio furniture in the middle of the night . lmao what .","307562":"yes , but it entirely depends on the individual . sometimes marijuana can exacerbate people s symptoms , while other times it can actually aid in lessening their symptoms . i know quite a few people who use marijuana to help treat their mental illnesses .","307563":"i m against spanking . there s no reason to be using physical punishment against a child , especially if they re old enough to understand reason . in addition , if a child is too young to understand reason , then they won t know why you re hitting them . it s psychologically damaging to children .","307564":"the fact that i have fish as pets doesn t really have any correlation with the type of food i eat . regardless , i honestly haven t had fish in a while . i think the last time i ate fish was a few weeks ago when i was on vacation . my boyfriend i shared a plate of fried calamari .","307565":"my job is giving me the opportunity to earn extra money through freelance work on the weekends , and i m so stoked ! ! i m definitely going to take the opportunity . we re behind on a lot of assignments so not only is it the perfect chance to catch up , but i can make at least more per week easily .","307566":"i ve been watching the documentary evil genius on netflix , and i m completely intrigued by the entire case and how it s been playing out . i m only on the second episode but i m looking forward to watching it again tonight ! !","307567":"aahh , thank you ! ! this made my day .","307568":"i prefer calling my boyfriend , but everyone else , i text . i m not comfortable

oppression and discrimination against their community , and promoting their statements regarding activism .","307573":"i wish i wasn t feeling nauseous rn . it s distracting me from my work . i m afraid to eat something because it might upset my stomach .","307574":"yeah that s why i said it , given the context of the relationship you ve only been talking to him on kik for a month , and for him to go all out and say he wanted to propose . . . that s just bizarre and a bit terrifying . i m happy you re out of that situation , though . it could have turned ugly really fast . take care of yourself first , the rest will follow suit .","307575":"honestly . . . fck that guy . he s and you re right off the bat , that s a red flag because you have to think about why someone that age would want to even date someone as young as you . second , the fact that he was so immature as to curse you out accuse you even wish bad things upon you is terrible and manipulative , and he shouldn t have said those things at all . you re not in the wrong . you need to look after yourself first foremost , and if that means taking care of your mental health , then you have the freedom to do that . i understand that you feel bad or guilty , but you cannot blame yourself for this . he s the one acting ridiculous and predatory and immature . live your life you will find someone worth so much more and will treat you so much better than this dude .","307576":"i like taking selfies when i m confident because i can control how the photo looks . however , i hate when other people take photos of me .","307577":"it s interesting because i have a tendency to not cry over major events or stereotypically sad things , but i do cry at minor inconveniences and insignificant things , lmao . like , i ve never cried while discussing my trauma with my therapist but god forbid i drop my iced coffee .","307578":"no , probably not . it s difficult for me to meditate i haven t done it in ages . the last time i tried , i was dissociating for a few hours and it was awful . i like the idea of hiking in the woods and being one with nature , but i d prefer to do it on my own time .","307579":"not really . then again , i don t pay much attention to other people , especially strangers , so it s difficult to really say . also , i live in new york mostly everyone is aggressive in some manner , especially while driving , rofl . so i may be a bit biased .","307580":"i have an xbox one .","307581":"well it s only the fifth of june , so there isn t really much to go on , lol . i ve been surviving , though . i ve had both good and bad days and i m just trying to take my days hour by hour at this point . i m hoping things will start to look up soon , though .","307582":"i like sitting outside in the sunshine and drinking iced coffee with my boyfriend . i also enjoy having bonfires at night ! !","307583":"thank you , i really appreciate it .","307584":"yes ! ! i m going to a meet n greet event to meet and take a photo with mike shinoda of linkin park later this month , and i m honestly so excited and nervous and terrified all at the same time because linkin park has been a saving grace in my life and i don t know how to convey those emotions to mike so i m probably going to write him a letter .","307585":"i m honestly not feeling well today at all , and that s partially because i haven t been able to take my mood stabilizer for the past two days so now my mind is all frazzled and i ve been overwhelmed by the simplest of things . i want to do things to occupy myself , but i don t have the motivation to do anything at all . besides picking up the tickets yesterday , i ve done absolutely nothing and the only reason why i was able to get the tickets in the first place is because my boyfriend drove me to the venue . i want to do a water and filter change on my fish tank but even that seems daunting .","307586":"yeah , and it s definitely not as if i m glorifying smoking by any means or promoting it or saying that its good for you . it s legit just a photo of me having a cigarette in my backyard , and the reason why i took the photo was because my skin looked good , lol .","307587":"i don t do it myself personally , but it isn t unheard of to see close friends and family give pecks on the lips as a greeting . especially in europe . it isn t weird , there s just a cultural divide and it s something most people aren t used to seeing .","307588":"there s nothing wrong with it at all . it s commonplace in most cultures .","307589":"it depends on the circumstances . while there are some people who have the capability to change , there are others who don t or don t see the fact that they ve made a mistake . it goes on an individualized basis , you can t really group all cheaters into one .","307590":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company .","307591":"i ve never exactly entertained a group of people before , so idk . my social anxiety usually gets in the way of that .","307592":"people aim for it , but it doesn t exactly exist . there s no such thing as the perfect human .","307593":"because the human race is very selfish greedy , and instead of using that power to eradicate disease and genetic illnesses , people would likely use it for nefarious means or try to create the perfect child .","307594":"the idea of being able to live independently with my boyfriend in our own house starting our own lives together somewhere away from our families . it motivates me because it gives me a reason to wake up and go to work every morning , knowing that the money i make is one step closer to that reality . it also motivates me to work on bettering my mental and physical health because i know that also aids in my own pursuit of happiness .","307595":"i think we re born as blank slates to a certain degree in that our environment raises and nurtures us into developing the personality we have today . especially when it comes to opinions we may hold , if our families have enough of an influence on them . however , there is also a genetic component in that people are more predisposed to certain behaviors based on family history . it s a combination of environmental and genetic factors .","307596":"people seem to believe i m a radical feminist because of a few opinions i hold , and they automatically label me as ignorant or uneducated simply because they don t take the time to actually get to understand my reasoning or the fact that i m not actually a radical feminist . it happens mostly on askfm , thankfully . people irl don t really judge me as harshly as others do online because i only really interact with people who already know and understand me .","307597":"be polite thoughtful , and listen to them when they re speaking and ask follow up questions to show you re actually interested in who they are . also , it s integral to remain yourself so that you don t give out a false impression of who you are . if someone doesn t like you for who you are , then obviously they re not the right person for you .","307598":"this is the cutest thing ever , omg . thank you ily too ! !","307599":"i haven t been to one in ages , but they were all right the crowds of people made me anxious , but some of the rides were fun .","307600":"back when over exposed faces was the thing and my eyebrows were a wreck","307601":"from the ashes by in this moment https youtu . be s gom mwslk","307602":"they probably believe it makes them sound edgy superior . the term is generally geared toward people who have liberal mindsets who get offended over the smallest of things , but now it s basically applied as a defense tactic for those who have no other means of defending their position in a debate or conversation .","307603":"i ve honestly never heard either of those terms in my life , but they sound like phrases a troll would use to taunt trans people .","307604":"i don t really have a perspective on the matter because most of them don t apply to me , since i m not a parent . however , the only opinion that i do strongly hold is that i believe circumcision is an outdated procedure that shouldn t be performed on infant males .","307605":"i love all kinds of art whether it s paintings , sculptures , photography , writing , music , etc etc . i really like surrealist art because it usually has a dreamlike quality to it that blurs reality with fantasy , which is something that always fascinated me .","307606":"story of my life , lol . i have such a terrible habit of getting halfway through a game then abandoning it because i became interested in something else . that s why i try not to download new games until i know i m done playing the one i m currently fixated on .","307607":"i think that people can post whatever they want in their bios . if they feel as if their illness is a large component of who they are , then it would make sense to place the illness in their bio since it s something they associate with themselves . i used to have neuroatypical in my bio back in the day .","307608":"roses blooming in my boyfriend s grandmother s yard .","307609":"you do realize i m years old , right ? ? not only is that disgusting but it s also extremely illegal .","307610":"self esteem issues , probably these people were likely raised in a controlling environment or simply grew up not happy with who they are , so they don t allow themselves to accept notions of love because they feel that they re not deserving of it .","307611":"people have said that i m a good writer , but i always think there s room for improvement . i used to write a lot as a teenager and i feel as if i ve passed my prime already .","307612":"i don t really understand how i would be able to get into a relationship with someone in the first place if i couldn t understand what they were saying .","307613":"i m doing well ! ! i just came back from the gym took a shower , and now i m going to watch some netflix before bed .","307614":"i suppose the concept of moving out starting my own life is what motivates me the most knowing that i ll be much happier in the long run once i m able to live independently without the influence of my family weighing me down .","307615":"it makes me feel as if we re living in the truman show , lmao . i don t really understand what sort of expertise kim has regarding prison reform .","307616":"lol . fucking hell .","307617":"aw , this is cute . cc littlesha","307618":"so my best friend never texted me back about the gym , so i just walked a mile around my block ! ! i know a mile isn t much at all but it s a hell of a lot better than what i used to do , so i m v proud of myself .","307619":"i have a lot moana , mulan , zootopia , brave , the emperor s new groove , tarzan , inside out , among others .","307620":"? ? ? my boyfriend i are planning on getting married . so for your own sake and health , i would advise you getting over this and finding something productive to do with your life .","307621":"as you can tell from the rest of my profile , i speak english quite fluently . it s the only language i know .","307622":"it depends on the severity of the mistake . i ll usually give people another chance but if they haven t learned from the first mistake then i usually cut them out .","307623":"i love the rooster teeth achievement hunter podcasts and shows they have a few , i . e . on the spot , always open , the rt podcast , and off topic . i recommend the rt podcast off topic if you want something to listen to while gaming . they talk about gaming and pretty much anything that comes up in their lives , and the people on the shows are always hilarious . you can find them on youtube .","307624":"yeah , especially upon meeting someone for the first time or at a public establishment , like a restaurant or store .","307625":"i don t really have an opinion because it doesn t matter to me how other people answer questions . i used to write long answers myself until i stopped putting the effort in .","307626":"as long as you don t send them hate for being lgbt trans . . . echomyname heartofstitches country peach alaskan dark witch pokemontrainerriver","307627":"yes ! ! life is strange is one of my favorite games .","307628":"the roses in my boyfriend s grandmother s garden are blooming and they re always so gorgeous","307629":"i think i m a little bit of both i m introverted most of the time in that i don t like being around large groups of people i need alone time often . however , i m extroverted in the respect that i do like seeing my friends often and doing things with them .","307630":"r pists , abvsers , nazis , pedos .","307631":"it s difficult to really give a straightforward explanation because addiction is complex and differs depending on the person . people can have naturally addictive personalities and jump from addiction to addiction , while others fall into addiction without having the natural predisposition for addictive behavior . if you re concerned about your friend s habit , then rehabilitation is always the best go to when it comes to recovery . however , you have to keep in mind that it only works if someone wants to be better and puts in the time effort to change their behavior .","307632":"yes , i m very much a romantic . if i m in love with you , i ll bend over backwards to make you happy . i thoroughly enjoy doing stereotypical romantic things , i . e . candlelit dinners , random gift giving , physical affection , etc etc .","307633":"i m very competitive , to the point where i won t continue playing a game if i m not semi good at it to begin with .","307634":"lmao , wut . feminism doesn t exactly exist on a spectrum like that , it s a label .","307635":"you can have opinions that align with certain forms of feminism without being affiliated with the feminist movement . for me personally , i don t associate with mainstream feminism because it s become overbearing people get offended over the smallest of things . while some of my views match those held by feminists , that doesn t automatically qualify me as a feminist .","307636":"doesn t sound like that s my problem if you have a poor opinion of my appearance , but ok .","307637":"not generally . i m very stubborn and while i ll take other people s opinions into consideration it doesn t necessarily influence my own opinions at all .","307638":"relationships are absolutely two way streets , but that doesn t automatically mean both people are to blame if the relationship fails . sometimes the relationship could be completely one sided where the other person doesn t put in any effort at all . likewise , cheating is usually a one sided thing as well in most circumstances .","307639":"my ability or inability to dance isn t correlated with my nationality . being american doesn t mean anything .","307640":"well , yeah let s get rid of the notion that having a natural human reaction such as crying is detrimental to a person s masculinity . everyone cries , and it doesn t make someone less of a man to do so .","307641":"i m not happy , but i m all right .","307642":"i don t get questions about my friends , nor do i see them often . i only really talk about things that i get questioned on . i m sure if i was asked more questions about my friends , i would end up talking about my appreciation of them more .","307643":"just because i talk about my appreciation of my boyfriend doesn t mean i don t also value the love from my friends . i just don t really talk about it .","307644":"yes , lol . even if it s just covering a portion of my legs , i just feel more secure with a blanket .","307645":"baja blast .","307646":"chester bennington , scott weiland , chris cornell , maria brink , and florence welch .","307647":"sure , no one likes working with someone who s a difficult person or generally unlikeable . it s bad for morale .","307648":"for me personally , yeah . it sounds like you re trying too hard , in my personal opinion . it would be better if you two sat down and talked to one another and you explained why you liked her .","307649":"probably when i m older , married , with a house that i own and when i m financially stable . if i even want kids at that point . i don t even know if i want any .","307650":"no . i m not ready to be a parent so i would have an abortion .","307651":"last weekend when i went on vacation to a music festival ! ! there was music everywhere , i had delicious drinks food , and there were good vibes all around . it was such a great time .","307652":"aw this is the cutest . i m so happy that i ve helped you you deserve to feel good about yourself .","307653":"it depends on what they ve done to hurt me , how much time has passed , and how our relationship is now whether we re amicable or not . there are a few people who come to mind whom i would help , but definitely not everyone who has hurt me .","307654":"? ? ? i haven t spoken about virginity on my page in months . where is this coming from ? ?","307655":"two years ago when i told my boyfriend that i was severely depressed and contemplating svicide . it was extremely difficult for me to say those words out loud because i was in denial of how bad it had become , and i also didn t want him to blame himself for not being able to help me enough . i managed to get the help i needed , but it was still an extremely difficult point in my life . i m grateful that he didn t judge me and did everything in his power to make me feel comfortable .","307656":"i admire courrtana and etherealms a lot they have such positive auras about them , they re both extremely compassionate about the things they love , and they re two of the kindest people i ve ever had the pleasure of talking to .","307657":"give yourself time to breathe and take a break when you need it . life can be stressful and its perfectly ok to take a day for yourself every once in a while . you need that time to recoup .","307658":"i used to really enjoy yoga , but i haven t done it in such a long time . maybe i ll get back into it this summer ! !","307659":"the only thing i have planned is that i m going to a concert in july . there s also going to be a work party sometime in july too , so that should be fun .","307660":"a house to call my own financial stability to myself my loved ones a clean bill of health","307661":"yes , it does ! ! it s recommended to read especially if you re young because it does increase vocab .","307662":"i think all humans judge by default it s in our nature to judge because it s how we ve been raised to perceive and assess situations . if you re a good judge of character , it can be a good thing . however , if you re judging people wrongly or prematurely in an unfair manner , then obviously that s bad .","307663":"sitting outside with a cup of iced coffee or a cold beer and a few loved ones just chatting and listening to music .","307664":"my boyfriend . regardless of how much time we spend together , we still always have things to talk about , and talking to him about anything is just solace to my mind . i ve never met anyone with whom i ve connected so intimately .","307665":"toes by zac brown band . i honestly don t even know why . i was thinking about your last question started thinking about the beach , then suddenly that song pops into my head . damn it .","307666":"i totally agree , lol . i can t fathom the idea of being so mesmerized by a total stranger s life like that .","307667":"no one is denying you ll make more with a diploma , that s common sense but don t act like you re all knowing and superior than me cuz just sending my around shows you re quite the opposite anon . my life is mine and mine only . i ll do whatever i want on my own time . i m not entitled to do things in chronological order . if i want to be trying to go back to school or not go back at all , it s my business , not yours ? ? ? ? ? ? exactly . i . e . i have friends who didn t finish college but they re making hella more money than i am , lol . it has a lot to do with the connections you make along the way and what opportunities arise .","307668":"this is fucking hilarious . no , there is nothing to apologize for because mental illness has nothing to do with a viable pregnancy . this is the last message i ll respond to about this topic because this is flooding my page at this point .","307669":"i haven t ignored anything you sent me , so idk where that came from . either way , i m not wrong because viability is used to describe pregnancy you re legit the only person making a fuss out of this . if you keep this up , i won t respond to you anymore . this is getting ridiculous .","307670":"i have nothing to apologize for . you re literally making a huge deal out of something minor , and at this point , i m just entertaining you . so if you re going to just sit here continuously post in my inbox that i should apologize , then don t bother . it s a waste of time energy .","307671":"rofl . just do it i m wheezing , omg .","307672":". . . i did . i said i was using it in the context of pregnancy . jesus fuckin christ , my dude . lmao .","307673":"video games writing reading music health fitness true crime lgbt issues mental health","307674":"i m always up front honest with them about my feelings , which means that i often tell them how much they mean to me and how appreciative i am of their friendship relationship . i try not to let things go unsaid because you never know when the last time you talk to that person will be , so i try to constantly make sure that those around me know how i feel about them .","307675":"if i was wrong then i would have corrected myself obviously you re new to my page if you think i m not going to admit if i m misinformed because i ve done so on several occasions when it s been warranted . viability is a term used when describing pregnancy . there s really nothing else to say .","307676":"you really need to jump off your high horse . viability is used in the context of pregnancies all the time , and it s never been used to describe mental illness . this isn t a discussion that needs further debate . if you look up viability in pregnancy , you ll see what i mean .","307677":"? ? ? if you re looking for an apology , you re not getting one , rofl . you re the one who came to me freaking out with judgment instead of asking for clarification if you didn t understand what i meant .","307678":"i don t think simply smiling at a person is creepy people smile at each other all the time in public , and its common courtesy if you have to interact with them in some way although uncommon these days . i think people just aren t used to having social interaction with strangers in public places anymore so everything is perceived to be threatening .","307679":"i don t remember much about high school except that it was a really rough period of my life where i dealt with severe mental illness on top of other things , and at the same time , i was working hard toward obtaining good grades . i didn t have much of a social life . i graduated high school in , though .","307680":"i m talking about viability in the context of pregnancy . it s medical terminology .","307681":"no , i m not . i m adequately clean and groomed and whatnot but i don t obsess over things being clean of the time . it s unrealistic and causes unnecessary stress and worry .","307682":"it s hard for me to really think about this in an unbiased context because i ve been dating my boyfriend for so long we ve both maintained our relationship even with our mental health issues . but idk , i wouldn t be offended per say but i would at least feel a bit helpless in that i would feel as if i wasn t giving them adequate support or resources if someone were to tell me they couldn t handle a relationship due to their disorder s .","307683":"do i look like some sort of weather expert to you ? ? lol .","307684":"this is the largest reach i ve literally ever seen in my life . lmao . ok let me break it down for you is something isn t viable , then there s no chance for it existing or developing into an actual living creature . therefore , the concept of mental illness in such a specimen is preposterous .","307685":"? ? ? your logic makes absolutely no sense . i m pro choice meaning i support the idea of someone having the freedom to get an abortion . that has absolutely nothing to do with mental illness , lol .","307686":"the original anon was talking about abortion , you dishrag .","307687":"i used to do photography as a hobby , if that counts for anything","307688":"pro death . you can t kill something that ain t viable to begin with .","307689":"i don t remember much about that time period besides the fact that there was hella drama . so probably not .","307690":"everyone has a soul .","307691":"it s only been hours since i last answered a question , and i was asleep for about eight of those hours .","307692":"you want to know my thoughts ? ? i think everyone should leave ron haydn alone and stop trying to pry into their personal business . they re under no obligation to discuss their personal lives with anyone and whoever is sending out these anonymous inquiries are pathetic creatures .","307693":"uh , yeah . that s pretty much years younger than me . i wouldn t date anyone younger than myself .","307694":"yeah , i wish i was home in my bed . today isn t going well and i m ready to throw in the towel .","307695":"i like receiving compliments about my writing those are the ones that really make me happy feel as if i m making a difference .","307696":"i like trying out silly trends like the new app i just used to make my profile picture , but other than that , it has no bearing on my life .","307697":"i think they really need to work on improving their blocking reporting system and actually investigate into problematic accounts .","307698":"yes . that s called blood .","307699":"ahh , thank you ! ! i love apps that make you into cartoons , rofl .","307700":"i mean . . . i hate everything about myself so i really dont know how to overcome that , lol . it s easy to just say love yourself ! but that isn t reality for most people it takes a lot of hard work to be happy with yourself .","307701":"i absolutely hate mondays especially on days like today when i ve not only had multiple days off in a row but i was on vacation besides . today wasn t a terrible day , but i was so unmotivated to work my mind was all over the place , lol .","307702":"nature i m obsessed with waves crashing on the shoreline of the beach , mountains with snowy crests , rolling hills of green , forests thick with trees , etc etc . i live the smell sound of rain on a humid night and crickets and frogs during the summer .","307703":"idk the only people i m really close with are courrtana , etherealms , country peach , and littlesha because i talk to them semi often . however , i do talk to a lot more people but not really on a regular basis so idk if they re a friend as much as they re an acquaintance who knows my trauma insecurities , lmfao .","307704":"if i make it at home , i usually use half n half stevia . if i m buying it out , i usually order an iced coffee with sugar free vanilla syrup and soy milk .","307705":"eh , somewhat if it s someone i m already friends with then yeah , but i don t exactly make it a habit to make conversation with total strangers .","307706":"lol , no he didn t ask me to lose weight . i ve expressed a lot that i m unhappy with my weight and he s become concerned for my health because of how much weight i ve gained , it s taking a toll on my stamina and i m developing problems with my legs . his concern is from the heart and he s absolutely warranted with his concern . he just wants what s best for my health and right now losing weight is something that has to happen .","307707":"tbh it s been this month ! ! my mental health has been better this month compared to the past , and i went to a music festival this past weekend which was hella fun . the only thing making me nervous is that i forgot my car inspection was due this month and i only have like a week to get it done yikes .","307708":"aw , i know how this feels . i know a lot of people online who i want to be friends with but i m way too socially awkward to try to get close to them so i just end up liking a bunch of their stuff hope they notice me , lmfao . this is so cute though , thank you","307709":"thank you ! ! i ve always been really unhappy with my weight and this weekend i had a really serious talk with my boyfriend about it , and he motivated me to actually make these changes and to stay focused on my goals . i know i ll feel loads better once i start making progress , not only physically but also mentally , and i really hope it works out .","307710":"so i bought a fitbit and i m looking into getting a small treadmill that i can use at home . my weight has always been a concern of mine but i m really motivated to change . i m afraid of going overboard once i get into the groove of it , but i ll tackle that if it ever happens i guess .","307711":"i suppose it isn t unheard of . reading a person s answers is like getting a glimpse into their life and knowing their personality , so it makes sense why someone would be attractive to you based on their answers alone .","307712":"there are some people who simply look for things to complain about .","307713":"lol i honestly experience deja vu all the time , and its incredibly irritating as well as disorienting because it feels almost as if i can predict what s going to happen but it s right on the tip of my tongue .","307714":"courrtana her kindness , compassion for others animals , and we simply get along extraordinarily well . etherealms one of the smartest and most compassionate people i know . we ve also gotten along so well and i consider her to be a close friend . lakocis one of the most intelligent users on askfm and i m always learning something new from his content . he s also a great father .","307715":"lol , i wish .","307716":"i m not entirely sure . i m sure it goes on a case by case basis if your illness causes you to have cognitive difficulties in relation to driving .","307717":"clinical depression .","307718":"i like sitting outside with a cup of coffee .","307719":"lmfao . this one actually made me laugh . thanks , my dude .","307720":"i don t think there s a correlation between the two at all . it s personally never been something i cared about i was also on vacation this weekend .","307721":"i ran some errands after getting home from montauk , which was miraculous to me because i was exhausted . but nevertheless , they needed to get done . i ve just been taking it easy otherwise .","307722":"no , not at all . it s simply a developmental disorder that develops during childhood . it may make life harder for individuals because of the stigma still associated with the disorder , but it doesn t make someone any less human just because they have autism .","307723":"as far as i m aware , there s no way to really prevent it . the causes are generally unknown and scientists are estimating that it could be due to genetic factors , environmental factors , or a combination of both . either way , the stigma that having autism is bad should be erased . it s a disorder just like any other cognitive or mental disorder . it requires understanding and awareness .","307724":"i don t really have an opinion what kind of opinion are you supposed to have about a disorder ? ? i do think it s extremely misunderstood , though .","307725":"cyber bullying is never funny . it s a serious problem on the internet causes real issues with people , especially teenagers .","307726":"the beach was so nice this morning . it was cold foggy , but the waves were so strong","307727":"sometimes , if their behavior warrants a rude response . i m generally nice to other people but i m not afraid to put my foot down if someone is crossing a line .","307728":"bullshit . i won t tolerate if someone comes to me with drama or any other form of bullshit . just leave me out of it .","307729":"i m just . . . not ? ? lol i don t have an in depth answer for you .","307730":"no , that s not true . if someone is bisexual , for example , it means they re attracted to genders . it doesn t necessarily mean all of the genders that exist . for example , i m bisexual because i m attracted to cis men and women , as well as trans men . i m not generally attracted to trans women .","307731":"yo , you re only . you re young af . take advantage of your youth while you have it .","307732":"i want to go to the brewery nearby and get another vanilla bean ipa because i had one yesterday and it was .","307733":"woody allen . you can look up the allegation investigation on wikipedia . i haven t heard that about james franco , but i also don t keep up with celebrities either . i only found out that people don t work with woody allen anymore a few weeks ago .","307734":"i went through a lot of trauma as a child teenager , which caused me to mature faster than the majority of my peers and develop a thick skin .","307735":"i regret not travelling more when i had the chance when i was in college . i did go to vermont maine , but that was the extent of my travels .","307736":"there s a difference between simply not caring and being insensitive to others . you can not care about something and kindly let them know that you re not interested in something , but being insensitive is purposely being a d ck to people .","307737":"thank you so much ! !","307738":"a variety of kinds tbh . i mainly listen to alternative rock , hip hop , nu metal , and video game and movie soundtracks .","307739":"both , i guess ? ? if i m hanging out with someone at a caf or their house , then i usually plan ahead of time due to conflicting

afternoon , idk what mellifluousvixen said because i was at work all day . someone simply mentioned the word fat shaming and i offered my opinion on obesity since i assumed that s what everyone was

give them whether that s through a significant other , family , friends , coworkers , etc etc . idk if i necessarily agree because there are obviously single mothers out there who do their best with what s given to them , but i also believe that having any general support system is very important .","307820":"i used to never put myself first because i believed that other people s wants needs were more important than mine . i didn t feel as if i deserved to be important and that i existed solely to help other people . over the past year , though , that idea has changed . i know that i m worthy

.","307833":"if i was pregnant rn , i would have an abortion .","307834":"no , i don t trust the government . i believe that the government is keeping secrets away from the general public in the name of greed .","307835":"lol that s the furthest from the truth . there are plenty of people , like myself , who dislike drama and want to stay as far away from it as possible .","307836":"i ll always have a soft spot of my heart dedicated to hybrid theory by linkin park . that album literally changed my life and inspired me to continue living when i was a teenager , and i get such nostalgia whenever i listen to it today . it s comforting .","307837":"i usually have a cup of tea before bed so that i can wind down and fall asleep easier . other than that , i don t really have anything

. . . basically ever since formspring died out and everyone started flocking to askfm because it was the next best thing . i honestly like askfm the way it has been over the past year . i ve been consistently getting legitimate questions with some inappropriate ones in between , but not as often as before , and the entire vibe of the site is much more laid back .","307840":"i ve never found practical jokes or pranks to be amusing they re just inconvenient , awkward , and immature . i don t believe that it s appropriate to joke about sxxual assault , abvse , hurting people or animals , disabilities , people s ethnicity or race , body weight , etc etc .","307841":"if you re doing something often enough to the point where it begins interfering with how you function in your every day life , then it turns problematic . for example , it s fine to drink socially with friends every once in a while , but if you find that your habits are detrimental to your life and causing problems in your relationships , then that s a big problem .","307842":"i m not currently reading any books , although i did just recently purchase some poetry books by lang leav in an attempt to inspire me to start writing more poetry . the last book i read was i am not a serial killer by dan wells basically a story about a teenager who believes he s destined to become a murderer and tracks down the killings of another serial killer in town . it was pretty good they made a movie out of it .","307843":"i would probably find it most difficult to live without hearing music is an integral aspect of

obviously each day is what you make of it and there are good mondays , but it generally brings me down because i still have the whole work week ahead of me .","307849":"i love hand tattoos , but i m a believer that in order to get a hand tattoo , you should have the rest of your arm tattooed up first . obviously it s a personal preference and it depends on the size of the tattoo , but it isn t

refill is coming from my doctor s office , not me ! ! one of the medications i m on . . . i guess my insurance doesn t like when people take it , but there s no generic so i have no choice . so it has to go through a pending authorization before it even gets to the pharmacy and it was pending for days on end . i ve been without it for a week straight and i ve been bugging out , and after making countless phone calls to my pharmacy and my doctor s office and my insurance company , i finally got through to someone yesterday . my original doctor sent the script over last sunday . the woman told

illness and can especially exacerbate symptoms in people with eating disorders or body dysphoria .","307989":"a lot of words that are used on my page are buzzwords that askfm staff look for in order

like in this moment , halestorm , royal blood , grandson , etc .","307994":"? ? ? i had a small fire with my boyfriend friday night in his backyard . it was fun , but that doesn t mean my life is wild

to write about , but it s also been the most rewarding , which is why i try to write about it whenever i have the inspiration to write . mental illness is seldom discussed , and when it is , there are usually a lot of misconceptions regarding it . in my writing , i try to clear the air regarding what mental illness is like and describe my own experiences to create an open forum for discussion . it s difficult for me to reflect back on my experiences , especially the trauma which has caused some of my issues , but it s also been eye opening for me .","308001":"no , i m honestly kinda down rn . i

victoria s secret body sprays which are equally delicious especially sheer love , which is cotton lily scented . i don t use perfume or cologne much anymore because it s been aggravating my sinuses since it s much more concentrated than body sprays . i also don t use very much of it at all .","308010":"how about they re both equally as terrible because no one should be attracted to minors and you re a fuckin pedo if you are . and if you sympathize with pedos or want to question this stance , then you can unfollow me because i m done with entertaining this notion . this should be common sense .","308011":"i m not going to sit here and protest against your pedophilia because you re just proving it yourself regardless of what you say .","308012":"i totally agree with you . even when i
