  One day it was cold and I didn't have a jacket or hoodie and my brother-in-law had M and a L Under Armour hoodies. The M fit but the arms were tight.

  Should be free or way les money.
  
  I've only tried pads. No real reason for not trying tampons. And cups are more ""newer"" to the market, i don't really get my period often so don't personally feel like it's something that I'd try out.

  yes, it's probably why I like the 2-3 kids in the future.
  
  brother barely lived with us. 10 year age gap between us. Off to college when my sister and I were still young. Then moved into my grandpa's house afterwards. Not there when you really needed him. Moved to Arizona on my high school graduation day. He tries too hard to have a relationship at times. his wife is a b!tch most times and usually causes drama - he's on her side etc He's a good dad atleast. He acts like our dad.
  
  I've always been close with my sister. We're two years apart. She definitely had sister rivalry but would be protective as well. Was in her wedding as one of the bridesmaids.

  I work from home. .
  
  but ill talk about the first day at college. I felt odd since we had an orientation and I didn't know anyone. I was near the door and this girl came over and we talked about how we were nervous and stuff then went in together.
  
  It was nice because we actually had a good chunk of classes together. Would catch up when we did see each other. She was like my first college friend there. She also reminded me of my best friend's sister  (looks & acted like) so it was comforting.
  
  I mainly stuck with my high school friend at lunch. we had a couple classes together too. so over all i didn't really get the real college experience since it was a community one and 5 minutes from home.

  I've never had irl FWB but I'm sure that I'd want the same kind of things relationship wise too but obviously with the less commitment?
  
  i like funny guys, trustworthy/honest, outgoing, not judgmental, passionate about something  (music, etc) , someone who wants the same kind of things, common interests and the opposites can be good too. nice/caring, not too cocky or clingy.  can talk about anything with. family oriented would be nice but not really a deal breaker either.

   What motivated you to get out of bed and seize the day today?
  ","
  Myself and seeing other progress pictures from people.
  
  It was pretty warm (70s) and sunny out. I layed out around the pool. Got a bit of color. uv rays were bright. I even ended up going in the pool three times. It was still too cold to actually swim in it comfortably.
  
  Also just felt like a walk. My mom went too and did well. She was complaining about walking 5 miles before we left but she ended up doing all of it with me. Mainly since she didn't want to walk alone in the dark by herself XD One of the houses on our block has Christmas lights up and gives off those gingerbread looking house vibes so we walked around to see that. nobody else on the street did much yet.

   I know someone who sees white people saying ""traveller"", ""been to many countries"" and ""these are the countries I've been to....."" on their dating app profile and thinks ""colonizer"", ""young Columbus"", ""privileged racist"". What do you think of their opinion and what's your opinion,swipe left or right?
  ","
  I think it would be a bit weird to include every place you've been to. It kind of kills the finding out part but could always ask a question that related to traveling as an ice breaker...
  
  I wouldn't personally think anything bad about the person. I like to travel so having someone like minded would be good.
  
  What makes someone racist for traveling? I could understand giving the other two opinions based on the  whole account, not just because they like to travel. I suppose the ""colonizer"" looked more to have a good time and f8ck a lot of people? The young colombus screams a good looking guy who never left home before and now he's being adventurous with his life. The privilege part reminds me of people that have tons of money and can do whatever and go wherever they want without any real thought - I still don't see how it would make them racist.

I still cringe when I hear about southern comfort 😂

  One time my dog was sick and we went to the vet at night. My mom, sister and I were waiting in the car. Some car pulled up and they had a dead dog in the car. It was a big white dog and it was stiff, legs in the air. The lighting flashed over it. That was pretty awful. Could see everything when the lights flashed.
  
  domestic dispute. don't feel like sharing all about that :P
  
  this one is more funny... I forget what happened but the same dog as mentioned above had to go to the vet and for some reason they shaved around her face and she had a cone around it. She came running towards us and when I saw the cone it made me puke 😂😂😂😂

  breathing, maybe close my eyes or focus on something in front of me. Thinking of nice things about myself or whatever. Knowing i look way smaller than I used to.
  
  luckily it doesn't happen that often. I think it had more to do with waking up way earlier and feeling rushed kind of thing from the get go. I was literally all ""nothing looks good on me"" way before we even went to the shops. Not the best thinking when shopping can take hours, usually.

  Put more bugspray on. Move to a different campsite. Mosquito bites made me have a reaction. Had to get a steroid shot, gained weight. Which the shot most likely caused the insulin resistance. Would have been nice if doctors told me what was going on instead of finding out that I have pcos this freaking year.
  
  don't be so hard on yourself. You were smaller then... Also you should have joined a gym way sooner. but maybe you would have hated that? felt pushed instead of own decision. should have learned earlier that diets didn't work for you, lifestyle change does. Also should have gave up pepsi way before you did too.
  
  Should have got a job while also in school, saved more $

  Can be risky. Why not just be cops pretending to be the teens...

  ","
  I can see both sides. If it's something that could poke them in the eye, sharp, choking hazard then i wouldn't want a toy like that. Toys usually come with the age requirements. If it's more for your husband's benefit then he should have them higher up where the kids can't get them, unless when being watched /playing together.
  
  I think I would just limit the cartoon time so it doesn't seem like it's always dangerous. Or just find new ones to watch. Most kids don't even know what is really happening / the meaning.

  Right!! I'm only close with a select few.
  
  But that doesn't help since I'm not in Massachusetts right now.
  
  I say hi and stuff but like nobody ever becomes a friend here. It's easier if went to school here or had a actual real job. People at the gym seem nice but I'm more into my workouts and I'm sure everyone else is as well. Dudes seem to look at me but never talk either ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  Going around the loop here is about 5 so I'd need to push myself a little further :)
  
  I actually want to run but its hard for me when I have a water bottle in my hands. I need to find something that I can keep it on that doesn't bug me. I know hyrdopocket is cool but I'm not at the point where I'd ONLY wear a sports bra. I'd feel selfconscious.

   Has Lyndsey ever come close to becoming homeless?
  ","
  Yes. One of our houses was marked as condemned and we were living outside in our popup camper for a bit. I was still young and thought it was fun rather than knowing that I was basically homeless. Also lived on Cape cod for a bit while my mom cleaned up the cabins that they have there. Before moving into a real house.
  
  Another time i thought we're doing good and ended up getting a huge box filled with thanksgiving food. Obviously they played it off not knowing who sent it type thing. We had a home though.
  
  Basically those times, i didn't know about being poor. It didn't matter.
  
  You could even debate that I'm homeless because I'm currently living at my sister's but I don't think it really counts that much because there's shelter, food (from me + them) and other life necessities being met all around. There's an address. I'm not living outside anywhere etc Good luck trying to cause drama if that was the intention  <3 nobody fucking cares, man.

  Well the main male actors were from that area but I do feel like it could be a little elaborated on as well.
  
  There's actually different kinds of Massachusetts accents. Like if you go to little italy, you'll hear more macho Italian twists to it. It sounds a lot more different than say southie area.
  
  People have pinpointed Worcester/Worchester (there's always a battle on how to pronounce it) which is right outside of the Boston line, heading towards the south shore. My grandpa lived there so that's fine with me.

In ur bio, u mentioned weightloss and fitness... do you have any recommendations for losing weight, please??
  ","
  Mytransphormationstartstoday.com is good. They have an 8 week challenge that's always on going. They help find the right macro %, food plan and exercise plan. Personally, I go more extreme than the exercise plan they made... I like doing less sets with more reps and they seem to like the opposite with very low amounts. It's part of the whole 1stphorm products that i use.
  
  Obviously listen to your body. Everyone reacts differently.
  
  if you keep eating a lot of ____, try limiting it or smaller portions.
  
  I feel better when I have less carbs. more focused on protein and healthy fats.
  
  drinking more water helps
  
  any kind of exercise is better than nothing. Find what works for you

  It, Candyman and Twilight Zone.
  
  I also thought ET was spooky since my dad had the album of it. All the scratches etc
  
  maybe even x-files at times.
  
  Young when watched. I remember my dad getting IT because he thought it was a cute little kids movie about clowns. We were watching it and mom freaked out. My sister still hates clowns. I think she's over it now since they did a clown theme last year for Halloween.

   At my school there was a competition to cook the best meal and the prize was £1000, I made a Coq Au Van and spent the best part of £100 on the ingredients and they disqualified me but I used wine but how can you make Coq Au Van without red wine? I was furious. Can you see why?

  That's true but I do believe it. The other candidate was just so fake and stuff at the town hall debate. Usually it's back and forth but the bil ended up going first each time. It seemed scripted. The dude also mentioned all his endorsements when the question was ""what have you been upto outside the race""... like that doesn't answer anything. Like he legit went on a rant. Then the bil added on talking about his own endorsements and the guy asking the questions was trying to stop him. Definitely felt shady.

  If I could change back time then I would have loved to move out at 17-21 age. I was stupid and just focused on school and friends. I didn't think too much about the future.

   According to this anon it’s racist that I wouldn’t date a Amerindian, I grew up thinking we had a choice on who we find attractive, date, marry and fuck but I guess that only applies to women and non whites and white men must have sex with any non white woman just to prove we aren’t racist .....

  if it holds you back a lot, don't get close. All relationships need trust. I think it's good to understand why you feel that way and try to be better at it. Not everyone is the same. Being honest about how you feel will help.

  That didn't happen.
  
  They ended up buying a hazmat suit, covered in fake blood. Sister put a bit of face makeup on me. I basically told the kids where to get the candy., waved a foot around. Walked around a lot. Brother-in-law was hiding under the candy table. Sister was where you couldn't see her too.
  
  Lots of young kids got scared. The last one basically was coaxed in by his dad. He didn't really get scared when he finally went in. My sister climbed the fence and scared him when he came back out. His mom was taking a video of it since noticed her 😂😂😂

  Don't feel like it. Rest days are good. I might be getting sick, not sure. I ended up missing my shows yesterday and don't feel like doing that today. I push myself sometimes so it's nice getting a bit of a break. Listening to body and how i feel.

  I'm not sure where it would be.
  
  I do like a mix of styles - mid century modern, rustic, boho and other styles. Just really cozy. More neutral tones with fun accents. A big kitchen. Somewhat open floor plan. Nice backyard or garden area. Pool would be nice. Maybe an acre or two of land. wrap around porches are always cool. I do like the look of Victorians but I'm picturing something a bit more modern... more of a homey vibe.

  two had clown themes. One was a haunted house which wasn't that good... The outside decor was more creepy
  
  the 1st haunted house was a bit scary. people jumping out, weird masks, dark and strobelights etc
  
  one was like a haunted motel. had a fence and three zombie robots jump at it like in walking dead. had a zombie cat.. they had a window display where a silhouette of a girl was getting undressed and a guy comes in with a knife, stabs her, blood going on the window. Some other creepy things.. also had part of their garage as a motel room and it had black plastic stuff around the room, a bed, a little fake girl ontop of the bed with a knife and bloody body parts.. had a tape of the girl talking...
  
  one was more whimsical like. Lady came out and we all talked for a bit. I guess people didn't really look at her house as much since it wasn't scary stuff.

  I was reading a book on some hence the question. I found one to be a bit spooky.
  
  ~
  
  Personally, yes. I've seen a shadow figure before. It was basically staring at me the whole time. I ended up getting closer to it and then felt like I couldn't move at all. Then a calmness came over me and the thing vanished. I went back to sleep. I know it wasn't a dream since I don't dream about stuff like that and I remember waking up and then going back to sleep.
  
  Took a bunch of different prom pictures and in one we're on the porch... When we got them done there was a silhouette behind us. You could make out a facial features too. I had someone comment that they see two silhouettes but one is definitely more visable.
  
  Footsteps going up and down the stairs. Furniture moving WHEN THERE WAS NO FURNITURE UP THERE! The house was in the middle of being remodeled, the upstairs was basically gutted and all new walls going up etc it was our first day moving in midconstruction. Mom and I had the tv going downstairs. Before this we lived in a three family.. would hear stuff and wouldn't think about it. It basically hit us at the same time that this is a normal house and that we were the only ones there. Was so creepy!
  
  My sister and her ex bf were home alone one day and the fire alarm kept going off. They said it sounded more like morse code. Took the batteries out and was still going crazy
  
  My dad's mom had a spanish tiled table that she loved. When my dad was taking down the kitchen ceiling, one of the tiles was up there and fell, landed right into his pocket. Also had bullet shells appear out of nowhere and roll around towards him.
  
  Once the whole house was done, nothing haunting happened anymore.

  kill myself at the gym? This girl was hogging one of the machines so I kept using a lot of leg and arm ones basically waiting. Then this guy and girl couple ended up taking it but they were trading off on different machines too.. I was getting fed up with them so I ended up taking the machine from them - like you both are on two different machines yet you had your water bottle and some pillow thing on the one I wanted. been waiting for basically the whole time. was like im going to use it. I don't care if that's bitchy.. like everyone else got to use it. She even made a remark about her waterbottle being there but clearly it was more like who do you think you are kind of thing 😂 they ended up leaving after that though? That was pretty annoying lol like my legs were pretty dead by the time i got to use it too.
  
  I even stopped earlier than usual. ended up walking around the building then just sat waiting to be picked up, mom needed the car so she dropped me off.. I felt pretty sick while waiting :/ did too much. feel better now that I have food in me lol

  Not even sure. I feel like I don't review that many haircare products.

  Arizona since I've had a shitty winter last year in Maine.  so it's been nice getting a tan and all that. Also gym membership pretty much every month. This sounds cliché but finding out that I had pcos and that was the main reason why I'm like this.... seeing my nephews and everyone.
  
  not worrying as much which I kind of touched base on a few days ago in a different question. Also one of the gym questions i answered tonight relates to it too.

  It was a bit boring. My brother had passes so that was pretty much free for us. They had a chilli event but I just ended up getting a hot dog, chips and brownie it came with. Tons of bees and flies while we ate. They have a bouncy thing, some rides, petting zoo, pig races, we did the corn field maze. My nephews and a few others kept hiding and popping out at us. Ended up getting a lemonade from one of the vendor stalls. They had a pumpkin patch and hayrides. The ride was an hour wait so we didn't end up doing it. lots of walking. Watched the fireworks. ohh they also had a ramp where people were doing tricks on their bikes - 360, 180, jumped over a chair, had someone sit in the chair while jumping over. That was pretty exciting since only seen in video games or on tv. One of the riders also high fived one of my nephews.
  
  basically there from 4ish and got back around 10. long dayyyy

They are 30/40s, both married and don't have kids yet. Maybe they took my ""fun"" out of context..

   What's are your tips for gaining muscles and losing fat?
  ","
  It's been forever since I've had a question like this so I'm probably not the best at answering right now. Even so, I feel like not every person would benefit in the same way!
  
  I do more reps than sets
  
  listening to your body definitely helps! Aint nobody wants to get injured over silly mistakes.
  
  eating the right foods/macros. I focus more on protein and fat content. I try limiting my carb intake but nothing too crazy either! Counting every calorie can get unhealthy though.
  
  obviously sticking with it over time helps
  
  could even change up the workouts to keep your body guessing. I change up the order of what I feel like doing
  
  i like starting with cardio and then moving on to the fun stuff.
  
  I'm not sure what else to say currently. I feel like they kind of go together with me. My legs and butt bounce back super quickly and then other areas take more time :/ my shoulders seem to get better fast too but arms not so soon.
  
  supplements can help but i wouldn't be codependent on them. doing the work is where the results come from.

  I kind of hate how the gym makes you do the same papers. The liability one is a given but for the other one if nothing changed then why waste the paper? I can understand if moved, different number or last name changed then give it but each time is a bit stupid especially when its already filed on the computer.

   Name 3 thing you would never  do
  ","
  1. drugs. It's just not the life i want. One of my friends overdosed because her boyfriend gave her a lot of drugs. And then my sister gets updated every few months that someone died from heroin in our hometown. Also seeing how different my former stepcousin can get is creepy and my real cousin is following in his footsteps, more pills though. It's just sad. And another kind of childhood friend is all messed up on something, doesn't live with her kids anymore etc
  
  2. I don't think that I'll ever be an alcoholic either. I rarely drink and when I do, I don't drink to get drunk. I don't want to be like my dad in that way. Last night I drank tequila drinks and i believe the last time was New Years or something like that and even then it was just one drink that time. I don't need to be messed up to have a good time.
  
  3. cheat? It's not right to the people involved or yourself. I'd make sure that I was single before taking the risk if its what I truly wanted and worth it.
  "

  1. I've never had a sexy Halloween costume. It was always the typical witch and other type costumes or original ones with laugh factor added in. 🎃
  
  2. I don't always know how to handle compliments, I do say thanks but I might not always believe in what was said
  
  3. I like pineapple coconut water from walmart. that's more random... just had a sip. It usually lasts me all day.
  
  4. pcos... guess that depends more on how long you've been following me or missed. Yet people are still rude when I mention it... I would always keep the whole not getting periods much a secret so it felt good when I first mentioned it here and then later found out in June why that was and more o.o

   Im guilty of eating bad sometimes and I have eaten icecream in the morning,  do you think moderation is the key to healthy eating and not cutting out so called bad food?
  ","
  yes, I do.
  
  I had chocolate cake today, it doesn't mean the whole day is ruined. You can still eat healthy stuff too.
  
  I think sometimes cutting it out is good too if you know its a weakness but still having it time to time is fine. If you don't have it in the house then it's easier too. I personally feel way better when I eat better. Being too strict can be bad since people most likely would binge eat sooner than later.
  
  I like ice cream more noon or evening kind of thing. Especially since AZ can be hot so its more of a cool down treat. crave it more type thing. definitely need to limit it at times.
  "
525056,"

  Not what I expected. She had a lot of people in the group chat and only two people that weren't family came lol Their old neighbor and his gf/wife? Even though I'm pretty sure he's gay or bi.... and then a mom that had her two kids with her. Everyone else was family.
  
  The food was basically Guatemalan stuff. There was something that sounded like famila.. it was some salad kind of thing with meat and veggies or something lol. pork and chicken tamales. pork rinds, some round dough thing.. one hand cheese, another had steak, their state flower and I forget what the other had in it., i think a different kind of meat. Those looked good but I was full already. I didn't eat that much but the food was filling at the same time. um..
  
  there was some chip thing that you put a tomato salsa type sauce on, some cheese, cabbage/coleslaw and some green leaves... funny story about the cabbage mix... The guy's wife put it on the island with all the other food. There was a bad smell like bo or dog poop. I thought it was their dog Emmet since he walked by and went outside but it turned out being that dish. He ended up moving it far away from us. Then 10 minutes later his wife moved it back over to us and we all started laughing. He then broke the news to her that it smelled awful. I don't think anyone ate that part when adding the toppings
  
  there was some dip that had radishes in it.. apparently they had mini taco shells you were supposed to eat it with or could dip the pork grinds into.
  
  cheese, meat, cracker plate
  
  our hot dog things went very well. kids and adults loved them. The chocolate cake too.
  
  there was some banana and dates dessert with powdered sugar on top.. kind of doughy. I just got done eating a piece of cake when they took that out so didn't try it. mom said it was very sweet though.
  
  I think that might have been everything foodwise. Tequila was the main drink mixed with a liquidy orange juice but it had a small amount of pulp on top too. I had a lot of it... probably 8 fl oz cup in total :o Also drank my water bottle.
  
  Watched some of the Red Sox game on tv. played darts for a bit with my mom, siblings and the lady with her kids. Was in charge of music for them when it was their turn to play. Then my brother and sister busted out the karaoke machine.
  
  we were the last to leave. Got back around 1am and went to sleep :)

  There's no good reason to bring weight up. People aren't going to make the change overnight. In most cases it could make them eat their feelings. It's used more to bully someone. How was i supposed to interpret it?
  
  Fat and someone gaining a little bit of weight isn't the same thing if that is the way you meant. Or someone pregnant - it's different.

  My old dog. My dad would put markers on her face for a costume. One time he did the same design on his own face.
  
  She had a bag tied around her collar to collect candy in. She saw a cat and took off. The bag was pretty much full and when she came back it wasn't 😂
  
  A few years ago, my dad was drunk and passing out candy. I guess we were running low and he gave a kid a coaster. I was watching horror movies and also giving out candy at times. I was watching a movie and he came in the living room laughing and telling me that he gave a kid a coaster.

  ","
  I feel like it was hurricane + tornado kind of thing happening. We were camping in tents. Noticed the weather was getting bad. The tents were originally more near the water. Was on a hilly ground that led down to the water. My mom and I ended up moving the tents under some metal thing where the picnic table was instead. Instantly the weather got worse. We ran into the car. Everybody's tents went flying, you could see clothes going everywhere, food etc
  
  Luckily, our tents survived. They ended up wrapping around the pole and staying there. Trees came down. It lasted for hours like that.
  
  My dad ended up sleeping in his car the whole night. My mom and I eventually went into the tent because it was getting better and bored of being in the car for so long. Nothing got wet inside, surprisingly.
  "
525232,"
   you guys ever been in a tornado? What happened?
  ","
  More so the aftermath of it. We ended up just missing it since we got off the highway. Kept getting the warnings on the phone. You could see the cyclone and everything. We drove around it then and stopped at some town. This guy who went the other route was talking about how his friends car got pelted with hail and the windshield broke.
  
  We got back on the highway, was safer now, and noticed the mountains and stuff were covered in golf ball sized hail. Lots of crops died.

  It's not really their job to buy me anything anymore.  Literally nothing came to mind. Obviously with the holidays coming it would be nice. I mainly get a big gift and then smaller things that I didn't really ask for but still appreciate/need.
  
  And I don't know what the big gift would be until it's closer to that time. Lots of new things come out. I'm not currently lusting for anything. Last Christmas i got my new laptop. The old one was 10+ years old and it had lots of problems at certain times especially with the cables and overheating.

   Missed opportunity, I bet you have a really cute laugh. Next time, someone will have to sit on your calves, rub oil into your feet, massage them to relax you (and make you weak 😊) and then go in with a full tickling. Will easily cause belly laughter and make you look (and feel) like a kid again.
