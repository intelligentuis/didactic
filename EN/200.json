When people are hateful or toxic the reasons varies with perspective as well because there are always two sides to every story and even then sometimes you\u2019d need a third person that sees both sides from an entirely different perspective. There\u2019s no need to be hateful but it happens whether it\u2019s on purpose out of spite, jealousy or strong emotions like anger which they may later regret when they\u2019re calm.
