  just wanna point out to a couple of exhausting creep anons that I delete about 85% of anon questions lately. and a small amount of non-anons, too. When I first started on this app I felt because of being an unstable person that I had to give into my OCD urges and answer or address literally every single thing in my inbox and I grew past that through therapy and becoming able to just let go of completionist obsessions/urges. So I delete. And sometimes, I do turn off anon. But I keep it on for the rare non irritating non creepy anon but when I say rare I mean rare. My nearly 3000 followers are almost all new asshole trolls. Every time I get the new follower notification I cringe. I stay here for the friends, the people who I interact with regularly, the non anons. the rest of you will probably get deleted.

  I've really not been impacted too badly other than not going out all the time. Most things are back in stock at the stores, I don't have anything I need. I'm selling art at about the same rate as before. My partner's job wavers between field work and working from home but work is steady.

  nope not anymore

  ","
  I'm only a little afraid of getting it.
  "
144903,"
   Do you have bad experience or good with anons?

  I don't like anons. I find it sneaky and inauthentic. I get some that are okay or even friendly- and I get awful ridiculous ones. But I would rather people not hide behind it.

   Is that around the same for most with the same diagnosis? Or do you all have your unique ways to battle it?

  I don't know. I've not seen much on google. But I've had two doctors act like this was something they'd heard from others before.
  "
144908,"
   It would be so lovely if something like that could help ey?
  ","
  it doesn't even bother me really it's just a thing. Like another quirk. Like an eye twitch.
  "
144909,"
   Yeah, I think the problem also is, all it takes is for something unexplainable to happen a bunch. And it leads to more and more paranoia about why its happening, what it could be, why I'm experiencing it. Quarantine just adds fire to the flames unfortunately.

   Bless your heart, is it constant, or does it come and go at times?
  ","
  not constant but regular. I yawn about 50-80 times a day, compared to a normal person's 11-20
  "
144912,"
   That's not weird to me given what you experienceüòä. Is there anything else that helps at all with it?
  ","
  nope I just stay well hydrated and well rested and daydream about braincooling like if they could just drill a hole in there that might feel real good
  "
144913,"
   I don't have the same diagnosis. But with the mental health issues I do have, I completely relate to the 'people jumping to discrediting things you say you experienced' thing.
I've been experiencing something really bloody weird in my flat the past few weeks, and it's 100% real. No one believes me
  ","
  I'm sorry you have to deal with that. I read stories about ""bad spirits"" yesterday and have been worrying about those in quarantine with things that aren't pleasant to live with
  "
144914,"
   Or did you mean hot, like overworking? XD if so, please ignore my last question. I'm a derp
  ","
  I mean literally heat, enough to constantly need a yawn to stimulate blood refreshing across the brain's surface.
  "
144915,"
   In all the things I've read about schizophrenia, I'd not heard of that. That sounds so interesting, but also frustrating. Is it like an Intense heated headache?
  ","
  no, no pain. Just yawning. And intense relief from yawning. Like I would class relief from yawning as the second best pleasure my body can feel not to be weird or anything. It's like, a wave of coolness across my frontal lobe
  "
144916,"
   If you were truly abducted by aliens, would you risk being called crazy, and tell people? Or would you keep it to yourself?
  ","
  I am too mentally ill for anyone to believe me. Even if I've been in remission for years. A sasquatch could literally walk up to me and personally guide me to a UFO with psychic grey people and I could take pictures but because I have that schizophrenic diagnosis no one would believe.
  "
144917,"
   Why do you use the brain on fire animation for your mood
  ","
  It's kind of an inside joke with myself. Schizophrenia causes your brain to overheat- or at least sometimes does and this affects me. I yawn like all day, everyday trying to cool that brain. It's a big enough concern that I painted this last year- titled ""Brain Cooling""

  She is very tame. One of the regular trainings we do is recall training, where she flies to a perch somewhere in the house and I call for her to fly to me. She likes that game so she's pretty good at it. Would I let her be out of her cage if the patio doors were open or something? no absolutely not but as far as being around the house she is very well trained.

  I answered eggsy's Q on it too and my answer at the time felt a lil wobbly but the more I re read it the more I stand by it.
  
  Race is a social construct and not a biological identifier because if you cut me open and cut open a person of a different race we've got all the same parts, we have everything that makes us human regardless of outside appearance. skin is as important to being a human as hair color. We put all that extra racism and prejudice in ourselves, as a society, making it a social construct.
  "
147943,"
   Hypothetical: You do a DNA test like 23AndMe and your DNA shows that you've a significant percentage of DNA from a race you didn't know you were part. Do you then get culturally educated? Start identifying as the race and reclaim their slurs? What actions do you think are/aren't appropriate?

  assuming you meant ethically not ethnically
  
  the best course of action would have been to try to save the other person's life regardless of law. But at the same time no one is obligated to act for another so I don't know about how ethical it is but it's still an option/course of action that can happen for any reason including law. The most ethical person would ignore laws and preserve a life but a person who would not do that isn't necessarily an evil person.

  yes. There are acrylic paintings I've uploaded, digital paintings, and digital drawings. I use procreate on the ipad for the digital work.

   On your art store, I see several custom sizes for wall art. Are they all hand painted or pictures that are reproduced?
  ","
  they're prints. Nothing on redbubble has been touched by me, I just upload an image.

   If someone gave you a picture of their dog or cat, would you be willing to make a painting of that same picture for a custom amount?
  ","
  I've done many pet portraits they start at $15
  
  I draw my portraits. I don't take painting commissions, painting is reserved for me.

   How was your weekend?
  ","
  other than the toothache and someone stealing packages off my porch last night, it's been good. I made art and knitted and spent time with my favorite bird.

   Hope life is treating you well. Are you looking forward to the new year? Any personal goals you want to attain?
  ","
  It is, thanks. I am looking forward to the new year, because I have new social circles to be a part of and events to attend. I hope to be healthier overall and need less medical care. I hope to continue pumping out art as much as I have been lately
