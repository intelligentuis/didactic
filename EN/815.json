, old documents written on paper and ink that may be long extinct or damaged and cave paintings etc . many we didnt know how to decipher at the time and who knows if we even translated the cave paintings right or certain images . and those people who experienced these beliefs or heard the original story are way gone in life","754320":"about a good . i feel truly alive when things are going great , i m not super stressed out or dealing with being in a toxic place with someone . when i can just enjoy the moment with family and friends and so what i live without there being some huge

shenanigans","754321":"everyone is beautiful in their own special ways . dont be upset and drag yourself just bc you dont wear a size zero or have skin without breakouts and everything else . each and

our emotions , reactions , and expressions can be sometimes easier to read . if you re trying to learn new words and their meaning try using bigger words at times when you read or write , ask people what they mean if they use a word you re not familiar with in a conversation , look it up and read examples on how to use those words as well","754362":"i dont like to consider myself famous , i m just well known . i m not an a list celebrity like justin bieber , ariana grande s etc . i m more like a c list while i have met a bunch of a listers celebrities or was friends with me way before they

wanted her to do that part and i ve been letting her do it every time since .","754399":"look it up","754400":"i was when i started performing live . . . and i was like when we had our first tour

cleaning my eye ?","754417":"i dont like to pick and choose favorites . it s kinda rude ranking eachother on whose more attractive and whose the least and stuff","754418":"i guess","754419":"probably considering they dont have the necessities provided to them to ensure theyre healthy or not . many people in poverty dont have homes to protect them from the harsh weather conditions which can also cause illnesses , illnesses if not treated can cause death and some people cant afford healthcare or ever receive it in their life , some people cant even eat for days because they have no money to provide food on the table for them in their family and if they do receive food from someone or a shelter it may not always be fresh and safe . like our water as well some of us are not blessed to have safe , clean drinking water to drink , bathe in etc . so never take anything for granted because you never know how priviledge you are compared to others .","754420":"thank you","754421":"oops

the longer you keep it out of the body the more thick it starts to become , that is because of the clotting factors and the platelets in the blood . now i am assuming what you mean by dry blood is that they are clots . if so then it could be a lot of things . but one of the most common could be you have some problem with excessive coagulation . you will need to get a blood work done initially to see what could be the cause . some times after there is not much bleeding but only shedding of the lining of the uterus which could be perceived as dried blood .","754486":"i always say tissue

my childhood days when i would argue with my siblings over the color crayon i wanted","754681":"but a super hero is one people like because they help save the city from danger . however a super

fetish","754705":"its probably just the filter but i do admit it s kinda orangey like more than blonde","754706":"bc it s a song we may not be familiar with and you just want to listen to the songs you know and enjoy . or you may want to save that song for another time when you re in a certain mood etc .","754707":"bear","754708":"wait till next hear to collect the full amount . because i still will have money i saved get from doing my job that i can rely on to pay bill s and that","754709":"haha she normally replies back onto the band posts","754710":"yea","754711":"yeah it would be pretty

summer","754715":"bc someone thinks i am with you or something when i m clearly not .","754716":"hello","754717":"no lol i normally change","754718":"i think maybe our knowledge and memories come from

ways","754725":"i ate at home lastnight .","754726":"of course","754727":"well yes because they re way older than me . . but it s not like a rude thing . it s just the certain age group we consider them to be under .","754728":"sure","754729":"i ve never sent nudes","754730":"i m sure you ll make friends","754731":"i m not engaged . and most of those proposals only lasted a week bc the guy was dumb","754732":"awe","754733":"good so far .","754734":"dont be they re anons for a reason","754735":"both ?","754736":"maybe if he makes a new account but just keep blocking or ignoring those type of questions","754737":"you click the little dots next to the question and hit block anon , you can even report them","754738":"what makes him an idiot for starters ? why doesnt he have respect ? we all should be respectful to eachother until theres a reason on why we should give someone the same respect they give us or not . like if someone was being rude and calling you names you should still be polite and just tell them have a nice day and ignore that person s actions . be the better person but dont be rude and ignorant like they are .","754739":"i mean you can do what you please to do , although it s not the best idea . and you can still block anons","754740":"they have a ride like this at an amusement park i went to in ohio . when i used to do missionary work in the summer with catholic heart and other organizations . it s a pretty fun ride , it s super quick so you really dont have time to think about anything before you re launched off . it only lasts for like a minute lol","754741":"if it s on here just ignore them and block them","754742":"the smell is amazing","754743":"yeah it was a small bag i got from the dollar store as like a snack lol","754744":"because it s not always okay to be sad","754745":"yell jumanji bc this year keeps getting worse and maybe that s the secret word to get out the game","754746":"it does","754747":"personal beliefs , and wishes","754748":"is a sad face","754749":"awe i m sorry to hear that . hopefully you re able to find some really great people who want to be friends with you . the first week of school , or even being a new student is tough ! ! hang in there , you got this","754750":"then why the sad faces","754751":"imagine getting pressed about an account that s not even active cba","754752":"ugh i would so move to england . london to be exact if i could","754753":"idk","754754":"that s how i am most of the time","754755":"dont get me wrong i enjoy doing music but sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming","754756":"the only way they cant pull up your account is if you block them , deactivate or your account is under review for violating something","754757":"what ex ?","754758":"bc hes been busy with managing his band","754759":"times a day but sometimes its normally twice a day","754760":"my mom","754761":"yes i have","754762":"oh nice ! !","754763":"my day was pretty good even though it was a long , eventful and busy day with work","754764":"ba ba lon","754765":"havent talked to him","754766":"this week","754767":"no but i have queso","754768":"my sister lol and sure","754769":"just chilling with amy eating tortilla chips","754770":"i have a lot of ghosts apparently but i m glad you like the song","754771":"no thanks","754772":"hi","754773":"i ve never had the mint one","754774":"dont eat your shoe , but hello","754775":"have you tried the apple pie flavored ones yet ?","754776":"yeah how are you ?","754777":"i would actually marry noah schnacky hes adorable and omg his singing voice","754778":"fatatouille","754779":"think it was because i didnt like this one song someone wrote for me bc well it s pretty cringe","754780":"things that i m passionate about like music , art , skateboarding","754781":"yep and plus we also took the year off to just enjoy spending time with family and friends and relaxing and enjoying ourselves for a bit and rebranding the band . plus christina was pregnant and is now a new mom so we want to get everything settled and back to a schedule that works for everyone","754782":"wondering about something that just crossed my mind months after","754783":"okay this question is pretty hard to answer considering most of my life i lived in northern california up until when we moved to southern california until . and well winter in california was more like summer time in california . i never actually had to spend days where it was cold , snowing etc . till we moved to tennessee and experienced our first year of living through all weather conditions . however i still prefer to be in a sunny , warm area then a cold , freezing one .","754784":"no i don t , in a way i feel it s something we all know is a huge issue in the world right now . and things shouldn t be changing so rapidly but we all just kind of shrug it off and pretend we cant see what s going on infront of our faces until it becomes something that cant really be fixed or solved easily . but even then we still dont care about the things we do that causes things to happen until theres nothing left to destroy","754785":"didnt everyone pretty much get spanked as a child up until like the s ?","754786":"owls and snakes","754787":"no it never really crossed my mind until sam smith released that song , how do you sleep when you lie to me","754788":"love it ! !","754789":"kind of a trick question bc if you kill someone . you re still considered a murderer in the government s eye , even if it was a good reason as to why you did so . such as a guy being a p . e . d . o . p . h . i . l . e and luring on young kids and you found out and killed that person and saved others from having to ever experience their child doing that or their victims knowing about it and thanking you . . . so in a way the number of murderers will never decrease as long as someone is out there still killing people for good or just bc","754790":"a good resolution to those who created crimes that should be punished more severe and get what they did done to them . like if someone killed an innocent baby by shaking them to death then the same treatment should be used on them and give them a taste if their own medicine","754791":"in a way i feel they help keep the community a bit better and safe because they choose to keep an eye on possible danger and harm that can happen , which a lot of people consider them to be karen s for complaining or calling the cops etc . but in reality if theres a large crowd of people that are partying and drinking and start to act rowdy its probably a good thing someone called it in bc what normally happens is someone gets injured or lost a life","754792":"well theres no such thing as a stupid watch . . . just it would be considered a normal old watch that cant do things like text or call someone","754793":"i would try to run as far as i can to safety then try to ask what to do","754794":"roller coasters","754795":"guys zayn is a dad to a little girl now","754796":"no","754797":"theres actually people who respect your wishes and boundaries . and i m sure i ll find that person soon","754798":"basically when they say trust me that makes me nervous bc i m not sure rather i should should believe or something is going to happen lol","754799":"nope waiting till after marriage to even have a sexual relationship"}}
