the point where i was getting black out drunk times per week . and on the nights i wasn t getting intoxicated , i was having at least one drink per night because i craved it . since i came to that understanding , i ve been trying hard to limit myself and gain more control over my habits . i don t drink regularly anymore , which has been difficult in itself . i ll have one or two drinks here and there , but it isn t nearly as often as what i was doing a month ago , nor am i drinking as much on those nights that i do allow myself to have a drink . i still crave it every day . but it isn t

cheated in the past vow to remain faithful to their partner after marriage , whether that s due to loyalty or faith or tradition or something as simple as growing older and maturing . however , other people may want to marry their partner to ensure that they won t leave them if they continue cheating , and it has nothing to do with loyalty or maturity at all . marriage isn t an end all , and they can be annulled . it doesn t always mean that a person is ready to stop cheating if they offer marriage . it could simply mean another method of manipulation .","297902":"i always value my privacy ,

entirely different countries from me .","297904":"i wouldn t know what to do if they were caught dealing drugs or robbery , so i would personally hand the situation off to or consult my partner . he has more experience with more troubling situations like that than i do , and he would know the correct means of approaching the situation and disciplining the child .","297905":"? ? ? change is something inevitable and it occurs naturally as one gets older . if changing means that i m becoming more like myself whatever that may be and not willing to endure bullsh t or herd mentality anymore , then i welcome change with open arms . i apologize if i ve ever been mean or hurtful to you , but i m not generally a mean person . if i have to resort to using unkind words , then something is definitely wrong with the situation because that s a rarity for me .","297906":"no , i was goth when i was in middle school though . when i was in high school , i was mostly scene or emo , depending on the day , lol .","297907":"it depends on why they got arrested in the first place , whether or not the arrest was warranted , etc etc . if my child was absolutely in the wrong , then i would definitely be very angry . i would hope that i would be a resourceful , open , and loving parent to where such an event would be rare , though . however , i also know that kids will sometimes act out in rebellion regardless of how they were raised because that s how some kids , particularly teenagers , are .","297908":"nah , i never went to juvie . i probably knew kids that did go to juvie , but i don t remember any of them now considering how long ago that would have been .","297909":"you guys are making me hungry .","297910":"as long as there are no pineapples , i ll try it . lol .","297911":"aah , i ll have to look into it ! ! thank you i ve always wanted to try a cheese less , or at least a healthier alternative , pizza , especially since my lactose issues have been acting up again . it s honestly terrifying when my job orders pizza some fridays and i have to play roulette over whether or not my body decides it can handle cheese that day .","297912":"the only person i desire to kiss is my boyfriend .","297913":"my partner and i are very comfortable with each other , lol . when you ve been dating someone for as long as i have , then nothing is off limits really . i ve frequently told him that he smelled and suggested that he take a shower , and he s done the same thing to me as well . it isn t offensive to me at all .","297914":"yes , i watched it last night . it was fairly anticlimactic , but i also recognize that it was mainly an introduction episode to re introduce characters and establish their settings for the remainder of the season with a few curve balls here and there . i have to say , though . . . the memes coming out of this episode are golden . lmao .","297915":"two fried eggs , bacon cheddar cheese on a toasted croissant with hash browns and an extra large iced coffee .","297916":"i m drinking a blue raspberry flavored sparkling water that s infused with vitamins caffeine .","297917":"i actually just discussed this in my last answer before i saw this question , rofl . in summary , i do neither . if pizza is an option , then i either avoid it entirely or i suffer through the cheesy goodness . it also depends on how i m feeling that day , because some days my body is more able to handle dairy than others . it s weird .","297918":"this is a similar answer to my previous response , but yes i do like pizza . however , because of some of the ingredients on pizza , pizza does not like me in return , lol unless i get a cheese less pizza .","297919":"i like cheese , but cheese does not like me , lol . i ve been having terrible indigestion problems with most types of dairy , especially when it comes to cheese . i ve been avoiding it .","297920":"i don t discuss my finances on the internet . regardless , i get paid hourly so it entirely depends on how many hours i work that particular day .","297921":"i m sure i have at some point in my life . these days , i prefer dark wash jeans .","297922":"when i was a child , i got tested and my iq was somewhere within the range i don t remember the exact number . i m sure it s much lower now , though . my intelligence has greatly dwindled over the past years .","297923":"i like a few of her songs , yeah ! ! i only recently discovered her music , like within the past days .","297924":"i already gave my opinions regarding her behavior yesterday . to comment upon anything further would be a waste of time , and quite frankly to reflect on anything else she s saying at this point would be giving her undeserved attention . if anything else gets sent to me about what s been occurring over the past days , it ll get deleted . i already posted my thoughts and i m not repeating myself .","297925":"thanks , i appreciate it","297926":"neither it s actually a snapchat filter , lol . but thank you ! ! if i had the energy to ascribe to a particular style , it would definitely be goth . most of my clothes are dark anyway , but i just don t have the energy or money to put it towards a certain style . i also look terrible in percent of what i wear , so .","297927":"no , it s never been something i was interested in . i have a friend who did attend college for it temporarily , though . but most of what he knows is self taught .","297928":"i don t prepare meals by myself , but i help my mother do the cooking every night unless we re ordering takeout .","297929":"hello do you have a question ? ?","297930":"yeah , definitely . however , it unfortunately isn t something i can do at the moment . i m already in too much debt from earning my bachelor s degree , and i don t think i could mentally handle working hours per week attending school at the same time these days .","297931":"it s great to have a bachelor s degree under your belt , but more more jobs are either requiring a master s degree or greater , or at least give more privilege to people who have more than just a bachelor s degree . i m lucky in that i was able to earn my degree , but it s becoming more difficult for college educated people to find better jobs , even with a bachelor s degree . i wouldn t call it prestigious because that s an exaggeration .","297932":"bachelor s degrees don t mean much anymore , lmao . i get paid more for having a degree than if i didn t have a degree , but in my particular company , only managers earn a salary .","297933":"no , i get paid hourly .","297934":"hello do you have a question ? ?","297935":"rolling on the floor laughing . it s basically the same thing as lol .","297936":"rofl . i know for a fact that i wouldn t be the only person celebrating the day . however , if that did hypothetically happen , then i wouldn t feel embarrassed because i m comfortable around my coworkers . we would all laugh it off .","297937":"i would change the amount of time we get to spend together . lately , we ve only been seeing each other perhaps times per week , which saddens me because i miss him every day , even though we do talk every day whether on the phone or through text . our work schedules are complete opposites of each other , and we never have the same days off of work .","297938":"tomorrow is national wear your pajamas to work day , and the ceo of the company approved my department s request to honor the day , lol . so now i m sitting here debating . . . whether or not i should actually wear my pajamas to work tomorrow . it s going to feel so unnatural , but i think it would be fun .","297939":"celibacy is a voluntary choice , so no .","297940":"no , i try to treat everyone with kindness and patience whenever i can . it wouldn t be worth it to be mean to my parents despite what they ve put me through because that doesn t change the fact that i still interact with them on a daily basis . it would only make living with them more difficult .","297941":"at this point in my life , i would choose stability . my spontaneous inclinations only further encourage my impulsive reckless nature , and i do require stability most of all right now .","297942":"not usually , no . i m either incredibly motivated to overcome a struggle or it defeats me completely . i do require encouragement from loved ones to complete a particularly challenging task , but i try to encompass their support to help me pull through .","297943":"i ve always enjoyed the writing style of stephen king , anne rice , and francesca lia block . i also like poetry by pablo neruda .","297944":"i don t remember talking about kurt cobain at all how long ago was this ? ? it must have been over a year ago , at least . regardless , i agree with you that everyone is problematic to some degree . i don t know the specifics of why kurt cobain was problematic within his songs , but i do want to point out that drug addiction having svicidal ideation are both mental health issues , so he shouldn t he stigmatized for those things . whatever he did that was problematic , his mental health issues don t excuse those things either .","297945":"over the past two months , it s been improving in some areas . however , i ve also been on a decline recently as well , so i suppose it neutralizes each other .","297946":"considering she s against vaccinations and allegedly has connections with nazis from what i ve heard , or at least she doesn t discount nazi ideologies , then yeah . i m not a fan of kat von d , and unfortunately i still own a few of her makeup products because i bought them prior to these things being aired out .","297947":"yes , i read the great gatsby when i was in high school . i wasn t a fan of the book , it was pretty boring to me .","297948":"no , not at all . then again , i don t think i would be able to tell the difference between an electric car and other types of cars just by looking at it , haha .","297949":"the victorian era is one of my favorite time periods to both learn about and look at picture wise , at least . i like the aesthetic of the victorian time period , how everything is dark eerie , the gothic architecture and furnishings , the clothing style , etc etc .","297950":"i get jealous of a lot of different people , regardless of whether they re male or female , a man or woman , etc etc . i see certain people and envy them because i wish i looked like them due to my own issues with self esteem and confidence , and that s something that i m trying actively to improve .","297951":"i don t know who i used to be to you , so it would be impossible for me to know whether or not i ve changed . it also depends on when you previously knew me if it s been more than one year , then i most likely have changed . people have a tendency to change , adapt , and grow as they get older .","297952":"i have a terrible habit of biting my nails , ripping off my cuticles , etc etc . it gets to the point where i start bleeding don t realize it until it s everywhere . but what helps me usually is painting my nails i notice i don t bite or pick at my cuticles if my nails are painted because i don t want to ruin the polish . i don t know if that will help you personally , but it s something that helps me a lot .","297953":"bury a friend by billie eilish https www . youtube . com watch ? v huhc tyz ik","297954":"yes , i read lord of the flies when i was in high school i think i was either a sophomore or a junior . regardless , i thought it was an interesting read and the symbolism behind the book was intriguing .","297955":"i only know their song zombie , and i m not the biggest fan of the song at all . however , i really love the bad wolves cover of the song from last year .","297956":"i wasn t aware that it was an american thing , actually ! ! i just googled it and apparently it s quite common in the midwest and the west coast of the united states in particular .","297957":"lately , i haven t had time to do much besides watch some television shows at the end of the night and occasionally see a friend or two . however , my hobbies also include playing video games , photography , painting drawing , and listening to music .","297958":"no , i don t currently have any pets . i used to have a betta fish a corycat , but they both passed away . i haven t adopted any new fish since then .","297959":"i live on long island . most of the white male population could be classified as a guido although i m not entirely sure if that s still a derogatory nickname .","297960":"no , the following option is completely anonymous . you can t look up who s following you or who isn t following you .","297961":"yes ! ! i haven t watched the first episode of the new season yet , but i will be later tonight . on a related note when my boyfriend and i went out to dinner last night , nearly all of the waiters were talking about game of thrones , lol . we kept hearing people yell out , hodor ! hodor ! every few minutes . it was amusing .","297962":"lol , no . my graduating class had kids , and i was only ranked within the top students of that class .","297963":"i mean , i have store bought artificial happiness . and even then , i m not happy most of the time . so i m not the right person to ask this question to .","297964":"yes , i am in love . it s funny how some feelings don t change even after a decade has passed . he still gives me butterflies when he kisses me on the forehead or holds my hand when we re in the car together .","297965":"on rare occasions , we ve argued . however , that was mostly in the past going back years ago at least , and when we have a disagreement these days , it s more of a civil conversation than anything else . we don t get angry with each other , and we re trying to understand each other s perspectives more than anything .","297966":"no , we ve never cooked anything in the firepit before . it doesn t have anything on top of it that you could use as a grill or anything . it s just a round basin with vents that you put the wood inside , and then you light the fire . we re thinking about getting a new one , though . the one we have is years old and is pretty rusted .","297967":"why not both ? ? i love staying over my boyfriend s house and sitting on his couch with a fuzzy blanket and a cup of coffee in my hands .","297968":"animosity is a strong word , so no . i m disappointed more than anything else . marissa and i were never friends , so my feelings don t run deeply towards her or anything . however , i m still disappointed in her behavior .","297969":"i m actually doing well . i had a productive day at work i ve just been relaxing with iced coffee since i got home about an hour ago . i m going to catch up on game of thrones tonight , since my boyfriend and i didn t watch it last night . i heard it was fairly anticlimactic , though .","297970":"lol , no . i ve never been to hooters before . we went to texas roadhouse got two appetizers and a full course meal .","297971":"i don t think anyone is remaining friends with marissa after this incident . it s one thing to insult someone immaturely for their weight , but what she did today was beyond drama . she not only attempted to hurt one person through her behavior , but she also consciously attacked others through her narrow minded viewpoints regarding women and fertility .","297972":"i forgot to mention in my previous answer marissa implied in her answers that the only reason females populate the earth is to be impregnated and give birth , and therefore , those who cannot give birth are automatically weak . however , this ignores the fact that statistically , females cannot sustain a pregnancy , and females have miscarriages . you cannot rely on something you assume to be basic biology in order to undermine a person when the statistics are not in your favor . i m not going to go into the feminist argument regarding the purpose of women , because it s and everyone knows that women are more than just baby making machines , but you cannot deny scientific evidence that has been studied for decades . marissa s logic is null , and it only stems from her own internalized misogyny that she herself has to learn to cope with , instead of lashing out against other people who are complete strangers and don t fit into her small perspective of the world .","297973":"her answers have since been deleted unless my app screwed up , so i had to rely on receipts to find out that this was indeed true . i was hoping no one would go that low , but my mind is blown yet again . if y all want my opinion , it s this insulting a person for their looks , their weight , whatever . . . that s one thing , and that s petty drama . however , to go so far as to attack a person for losing something as intimate and personal as a pregnancy , that s one of the most vile things i ve ever heard discussed on askfm . everyone knows that marissa has always been one for dramatic effect , likely due to her own need for attention which isn t necessarily bad , everyone does need attention , but going down such a toxic and hurtful route is unhealthy and manipulative . this goes further than liberals v . conservatives , trans v . cis , gay v . straight , etc etc . this was a personal attack . i ve only ever associated with marissa once , and that was when she called me on the phone to tell me the truth about cas years ago . i appreciated her efforts , but that was a different time . people usually grow as they get older , but in this instance , her development has been hindered . i honestly hope she does mature and realize the implications of her words and actions , because calling everyone derogatory names and trying to take the moral high road won t help this time .","297974":"i normally don t care , but that doesn t mean i don t want to remain aware of what s happening and whats happening was enough for mariah to come back , so obviously it was big . please hold . i m being briefed rn .","297975":"my feed is filled with stupid polls , so it isn t showing me much . it s only going back an hour ago .","297976":"this doesn t tell me what happened , lmao . regardless of what you think my reaction would be , my inbox still blew up this afternoon and i have zero idea of what happened . so if someone could kindly inform me , that would be wonderful .","297977":"i just got home from work . did something happen ? ?","297978":"i m very content rn .","297979":"yes , i m fine . i just went out to dinner with my boyfriend and had so much food , i m stuffed . lmao .","297980":"in my boyfriend s backyard . he has a firepit .","297981":"i m all right . just waiting for my boyfriend to get home from work so i can see him tonight . we were supposed to have a fire tonight , but it just started raining . sorta bummed about that .","297982":"thanks , i appreciate it","297983":"probably ! ! my boyfriend and i might watch it tonight . if not , then tomorrow night .","297984":"it is drama there s no threatening behavior , no one is at risk of getting hurt , and its just petty words on a screen . if the situation called for disciplinary action , then perhaps i would have said something . but someone misgendering a friend of mine , when that friend is more than capable of speaking for himself , isn t a serious crime . it s simply drama .","297985":"i don t think you guys understand the words stop spreading drama . i don t care about other people s opinions because they don t affect my life . it isn t a thought that crosses my mind , and if i focused on other people s views then i wouldn t be able to progress forward with myself .","297986":"this is a good perspective ! ! i never thought about it that way .","297987":"the whole if you love something , set it free . if it comes back , it s yours . if it doesn t , it never was . if you love something , or someone in this instance , why would you willingly let them go without trying to make it work ? ? i don t believe that love never existed if the person never returns to you either . people grow , change , and adapt , and just because someone leaves you and moves on doesn t mean they never loved you . it could be as simple as someone outgrowing you because you don t provide them with what they need anymore .","297988":"definitely not , lmao . the only cardinal virtue i possess is perhaps fortitude because i ve persevered through hardship .","297989":"i don t have any live broadcast apps , so i can t help you .","297990":"i don t follow anyone who s transphobic , to my knowledge .","297991":"i don t care enough about other people s opinions to have an opinion of my own . stop trying to spread drama .","297992":"i follow haydn , so i ve been seeing his posts . no need to send me links to his page anonymously .","297993":"ashkenazi jewish is a race on it s own , i believe . again , i m not very educated on racial makeups , but my andme results identified me as a certain percentage of ashkenazi jewish , so i m assuming it s a separate race .","297994":"i don t really know much about race identities like this , but if i was native american , then i would consider myself to be both white and native american as well as jewish . most people these days are fairly mixed anyway , and percent is a large percentage and i would likely embrace my native american side .","297995":"that s only percent , lol . it depends on the other percentages .","297996":"as i just stated earlier , i just finished up the laundry and now i m relaxing and listening to music . i m also debating on either taking a nap or drinking another seltzer .","297997":"yes , i am white .","297998":"i m doing well . i just finished up the laundry now i m listening to billie eilish again .","297999":"uh , haydn is a dude . he s been a guy for as long as i can remember , and i ve known him for probably years at this point . regardless , who cares what someone else thinks . someone else s gender isn t anyone else s business , lol . he s going to be a man regardless of what people think of him .","298000":"any of the times i ve gone on vacation with my boyfriend were happy moments . it s nice to spend a weekend with someone you love where you have no real responsibilities and can do whatever your heart desires .","298001":"friendship cannot be forced it should happen naturally . i m not on askfm to make friends , either way . i m on askfm to answer questions and occasionally ask questions to the people i follow .","298002":"my weekend has been good . i didn t do much yesterday at all , but today i woke up early and did three loads of laundry the fourth is in the washer , as well as finished up my freelance work . i m planning on seeing my boyfriend later after he gets out of work , and if it doesn t rain , then we re going to have a fire in his backyard .","298003":"hello . do you have a question ? ?","298004":"no , i have no desire to do that .","298005":"there s nothing wrong with needing attention . it means that the person doesn t get adequate attention irl . and sh is done because it s an addiction , sometimes people don t need a reason to do it . it simply because an addictive habit .","298006":"i never watched jersey shore , but i ve heard the names before .","298007":"i don t really care what other people think about my current profile picture , lol .","298008":"uh , that s a bit weird and unnecessary . thank you , though .","298009":"no , that s quite common actually . people express grief in different ways , and sometimes people are numb to their emotions at first or feel as if they have to be strong for somebody else . when my boyfriend s dog died , i was the only person in the room who wasn t crying however , it did hit me about a week later , but i cried in private .","298010":"i like this profile picture for now . i don t need a poll to decide which one i want to use .","298011":"i think that s what the snapchat filter did . either way , i have lost weight recently .","298012":"haha , thank you ! !","298013":"lol . well , i hope you enjoy yourself then .","298014":"uh , this is a bit weird . but i use xtra laundry detergent with downy softener .","298015":"lol . well , no one said that you had to like it . i quite like it , and that s all that matters .","298016":"anyone have any questions ? ? i m done with my work just waiting on the laundry to finish .","298017":"aw , thank you . that s sweet .","298018":"rofl . perhaps that s why i like it so much .","298019":"no , i ve never gotten road rage before . i m far too nervous on the road to be angry , lol . i try to drive as safely as possible , even if other drivers are being reckless .","298020":"i was years old .","298021":"tbh i would probably tell them straightfoward that pictures that like make me uncomfortable and ask them why they felt compelled to send it to me . then i would ask them if they re okay , how they re feeling , etc etc . i would still care about them but wonder why they felt the need to send me that picture in the first place .","298022":"no , i don t listen to k pop .","298023":"gay rights advocacy isn t just reserved for people who have been to pride . a supporter of gay rights is simply a person who believes that people of the lgbtq community deserve equal rights . i don t need to attend a pride festival to support what i believe in .","298024":"yes , i met him once during a meet n greet event during one of the projekt revolution tours . i was so excited and nervous that i babbled over my words while trying to speak to him , lol .","298025":"thank you ! ! it makes me contemplate trying to grow my hair out to that length , haha . i ve never had it that long before . and thank you my sunday has been good so far . i woke up early to finish up my freelance work , and i ve been content with sitting on my laptop , drinking coffee , and listening to a lo fi playlist on spotify .","298026":"i disagree with you . people who are overweight are attractive to many different people , and just because they re overweight doesn t necessarily mean they re sloppy . you can be overweight and still love yourself and have a keen sense of style .","298027":"no . i ve never been in a position where i could be catfished . i ve never used any dating sites before .","298028":"yes . i was extremely upset when chester bennington passed away because he was a strong influence during my teenage years and i owe him and his music my life .","298029":"yeah , i m bisexual . i ve dated cis men and cis women .","298030":"i can t answer that question for you , lol . it would depend on whether you simply find me attractive or other non binary or trans people in general .","298031":"i don t think that s unusual , in the sense that you re not alone in your feelings , but it s definitely a concern . do you see a mental health professional ? ? if you do , i would suggest that you talk to them about these feelings because they re not healthy .","298032":"i m not getting into the gender argument again , lol . i can be attractive regardless of my gender identity , if you find me attractive with long hair then congratulations you find a non binary person attractive .","298033":"lol . it s actually a snapchat filter my hair doesn t actually look like that , but i do like it a lot . thanks ! !","298034":"yes , i actually have a vape that i use during my minute breaks at work instead of smoking cigarettes . however , if i m having a particularly stressful day , i do smoke a cigarette or two during the day .","298035":"no , not at all . pathological lying can be a symptom of a mental health condition , where the liars feel a compulsive urge to lie about both significant and insignificant matters , regardless of who they re talking to or what the situation is . not everyone is a pathological liar , to any extent . some people despise lying and try to live their best lives being honest and truthful .","298036":"it depends on my mood sometimes i get angry relatively easily , while other times i allow things to slide off my shoulders . however , i mainly keep it to myself i m good at suppressing it so that other people can t see it .","298037":"i have so many that it would be impossible to count them all . during the fall winter , i basically live in sweaters and hoodies . my favorite hoodie is a bright red one that my boyfriend got during his time as an ice hockey captain during his high school years . it s so comfortable .","298038":"i like earth tones mahogany , forest green , navy blue , royal purple , dark brown , grey , and black .","298039":"i understand how you feel . he probably swears up down now that he wouldn t , probably because you reacted unfavorably to him saying he would initially , but that doesn t erase the fact that he originally said he would date a year old . either way , do what s best for you personally . if you re unsure of the situation and of him right now , it may be better for you if you stopped talking to him even just temporarily in order for you to wrap your head around things .","298040":"personally , i wouldn t feel comfortable talking to someone as a potential partner if they confessed that they would date someone years younger than them and they re only years old . for someone who s an adult to say that they would willingly date a child is an extreme red flag , at least in my opinion . whether or not you should stop talking to him is ultimately up to you . but i believe the fact that you re questioning this in the first place may be an indication that you re also uncomfortable with the situation .","298041":"people should always be reliable , so it isn t so much a matter of when , but how . how a person demonstrates their reliability , what they do for others to prove that they can be relied upon , etc etc . being a reliable person is a positive trait because it shows friends loved ones that you care about them enough to stand up for them and be present during hardships .","298042":"borderline personality disorder is a chronic condition that may include mood instability , difficulty with interpersonal relationships , and high rates of self injury and svicidal behavior .","298043":"i would teach everyone compassion , i believe that would have the biggest and most positive impact on humanity . in short , everyone is struggling we re all fighting battles within ourselves that no one knows anything about , and if we had more compassion and recognized that other people were fighting to survive , perhaps there would be less conflict or toxic behaviors in the world . even the most intolerant people are fighting their own battles , and while it can be hard to have compassion for them , it s something we should keep in the back of our mind .","298044":"perhaps meeting my boyfriend ! ! i feel like we would have met , or at least gotten together , eventually had we not met at the time we did when we were sophomores in high school .","298045":"no , my family doesn t have any traditions like that . occasionally , my boyfriend s family will have a family dinner if everyone is available , and it s usually some sort of italian food eggplant parm or chicken francaise , usually . i honestly have no idea what i m having for lunch or dinner today , rofl . it s only am .","298046":"hello do you have a question ? ?","298047":"it s literally been years , haha .","298048":"drinking and drugs .","298049":"i haven t needed to study in over five years , lol .","298050":"i discuss my low libido every now and again because it isn t as if i m talking about my preferences or anything . it s important to acknowledge that low libido exists and not everyone wants to have sex . if a question is asking me a personal question about my sex life or my preferences , then yeah i usually delete them .","298051":"yes ! ! i ve never owned any before , but i think they re super cute .","298052":"i ve always looked much younger than my age , unfortunately .","298053":"no , i don t know if they re friendly or not .","298054":"look around for its owner . luckily the owner was always nearby .","298055":"yeah , on a few occasions .","298056":"this is true , but i don t know most people . these two people in particular are important to my life , which is why i admire them so much .","298057":"i admire my boyfriend my best friend . they re both incredibly strong people who have been through a lot of hardship during their lives , but they re nevertheless persevered through it all and have made great lives for themselves . they re also both intelligent , caring , funny , and creative .","298058":"loyalty makes someone gain my respect , whether that s loyalty to a friendship or their partner . it s a simple concept but it s not seen very often anymore , sadly . what makes me lose respect for someone is dishonesty . it s so easy to be truthful and straightforward , but a lot of people are also dishonest .","298059":"i ve always wanted to take a cross country road trip with my boyfriend and or best friend . i would want to visit yellowstone , the grand canyon , and redwood national park .","298060":"yeah , on quite a few occasions . needless to say , i don t talk to those people anymore .","298061":"depends on what kind of change i m facing . i easily adapt in time , but it does make me anxious when i m faced with significant change .","298062":"i generally vent to a friend who s willing to listen and chain smoke cigarettes , lol . i used to impulsively get drunk , either with a friend or by myself , but i ve been abstaining from alcohol recently . it s been difficult to cope with my range of emotions without relying on alcohol to numb them for me .","298063":"no , not myself personally . however , this past week my boyfriend and his father put together a gazebo for the backyard .","298064":"i ve reported one or two people to human resources because they were inappropriate , but i don t really consider that being a snitch . it was a necessary action for the dilemma at hand .","298065":"i don t personally know . you never know how a relationship is behind closed doors , and while some people may post on social media all of the good things about their relationship and make it seem magical , that doesn t necessarily mean that they don t have their own problems too .","298066":"i prefer burrito bowls . but i had a burrito from taco bell about two months ago and enjoyed it .","298067":"i haven t been feeling the greatest lately . i m undergoing a lot of changes in my life , which have been difficult to cope with at times . but it s an adjustment period . i know i ll be okay eventually .","298068":"when it comes to watching a movie , i wouldn t know that i didn t like it until i watched it , so i would of course give the movie a chance in the beginning . for other activities , i think it depends on the activity itself . if there was something i really didn t enjoy at all , i would simply tell him and he would do it by himself or with his friends .","298069":"i literally just said it s something that i don t feel comfortable discussing on askfm , lol .","298070":"lol . yes , i feel guilty because i used the rosebuds cheat code on the sims to give myself extra money , rofl .","298071":"it s something that i don t feel comfortable discussing on askfm . however , my behavior made me feel incredibly guilty after i did it and i still regret it .","298072":"i always try my best , yes . there will always be days where i don t feel up to doing my best , though , and that s perfectly okay . it s healthy to rest and give yourself time , as long as it isn t in excess .","298073":"depends on your definition of crazy . if you mean someone who s wild and out of control , one of my coworkers definitely fits that description , lol . she always invites me to go out with her , but i always turn her down because there s always drama surrounding her , she gets into fights both verbal and physical , she gets kicked out of bars , etc etc .","298074":"i believe so , yes . however , you have to be wary of people taking advantage of your kindness .","298075":"tomorrow night ! ! it s on hbo .","298076":"it s definitely a pain in the ass , lmao . but she s disabled mobility issues , so she requires help getting the supplies and food from the fridge . i ll often cook something in the microwave or in the oven while she s using her portable stove top , i ll get plates and utensils for the three of us , and i put everything away and load the dishwasher when we re done .","298077":"yes ! ! i haven t finished re watching season seven yet , though . i only have three episodes left .","298078":"i help my mother cook every night , but i haven t done any cooking by myself in a few weeks .","298079":"i personally wouldn t give him another chance . he probably only wants you back because he can t stand seeing you moving on and trying to live your best life . put the past to rest and move forward you deserve to give that to yourself .","298080":"probably go to a flea market and negotiate with the sales people there to get things for super cheap , lol .","298081":"i agree with urlsareshittbh on this one , who said crossbow ! ! i think it was danny , lol . good to use from afar , but you can also use it in close quarters as well .","298082":"i m definitely more introverted . i get exhausted when i see people every day , and i need time to myself every night to recharge .","298083":"i can t tell if you think i would too , or if you re referring to the anon who said i eould . either way , it s a ridiculous notion .","298084":"i have no idea what this means .","298085":"hello do you have a question ? ?","298086":"oh really ? ? i haven t seen it on anyone else s page . but yes , i definitely agree , lol . so many people have so much hate and resentment in their hearts that it becomes detrimental to their own wellbeing .","298087":"i figured , the writing style was much different from yours , and you ve remained somewhat calm during this discussion . meanwhile , the anon who sent me those gross messages was extremely agitated lol .","298088":"my message was clearly sarcasm , so obviously not . this is a very stupid thread .","298089":"lol what . yes , clearly the best way to cleanse yourself is to shower with clothes on your body .","298090":"showers . i dislike baths .","298091":"seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile , rainy days , the first cup of coffee in the morning , receiving positive affirmations or reinforcement in both my personal and professional lives , writing something that i m proud of , and listening to music .","298092":"it s in my bio so that people refer to me by my pronouns if they re talking about me . like i said yesterday i think ? , just because she her doesn t bother me doesn t mean my pronouns have changed .","298093":"hello do you have a question ? ?","298094":"it really amuses me how people get so bent out of shape over my gender . if someone s gender , or sexual orientation or anything else for that matter , doesn t personally affect you , then why be bothered by it ? ? you can try to negate my gender for the rest of my time spent on askfm , but it doesn t make a difference to me . you re wasting your breath sending me anonymous messages and exerting unnecessary time and energy over something out of your control . it s pointless .","298095":"no , it doesn t really bother me if people misgender me unless they know i m non binary and insist on calling me a woman out of spite . in general , other people s opinions have no affect on my gender and their opinions ultimately make no difference in the long run .","298096":"you can insist that i m a woman all you want , but your suggestions are ultimately futile and don t make a difference to me . regardless of your stance on gender identity , i m still non binary and that won t change .","298097":"no , i m clearly non binary . the medication i take has no correlation with my gender .","298098":"other people s gender have no affect on my own gender , lol . i m glad that those people discovered who they are , but that doesn t automatically mean i m not non binary .","298099":"i m assigned female at birth , so abortion is completely relevant to me personally . regardless , you don t have to be a woman to support abortion .","298100":"make abortion available nation wide and have it covered under health insurance .","298101":"i think it ultimately depends on the individual sometimes baby steps are warranted because it helps people ease into change , while other times people are more comfortable taking big steps because it would be the only thing that works for them . i . e . my boyfriend required big steps when he went sober , otherwise he never would have broken the cycle of addiction if he tried to take baby steps . he quit cold turkey and has been sober from drugs ever since it s been a few years now , and he rarely drinks alcohol except on special occasions every few months .","298102":"i reconnected with an old friend a few months ago i have an online friend whom i spoke to for years when i was a teenager , and she ended up becoming one of my closest friends . we grew apart when i entered college because that s what happens during life at times , but i messaged her recently to gain a deeper understanding of my past since i don t remember much about my early life at all . i last made a new friend back in november . there was a new woman who was hired at my job , and we clicked immediately .","298103":"no , i disagree with the quote . sometimes rumors can he harmful to a person s reputation , especially if the rumors are false , and it s valid for a person to complain about rumors spread about them . i also believe it s sometimes warranted for a person to clear the air and acknowledge the rumors by discussing the truth , otherwise people are going to believe whatever is being spread about them and give them the wrong impression .","298104":"i would have kept a diary from the time i was around years old i don t remember anything about my life from before the age of , and it would be interesting to read about my experiences from then so that i could get a better understanding of my childhood and why i developed into the person i am today .","298105":"weak by ajr https www . youtube . com watch ? v txccybmkdb","298106":"i believe this is only in american culture , because kissing your friends on the cheeks and generally showing physical forms of affection is commonplace in other cultures .","298107":"i might see my boyfriend this morning before he heads into work in the afternoon , but it depends on what time he wakes up . if he wakes up early enough , we may go to the diner for some breakfast .","298108":"i celebrate christmas , halloween , thanksgiving , and birthdays . i don t generally celebrate easter , valentine s day , or new years eve day . occasionally my boyfriend and i will buy small gifts of appreciation on valentine s day , but it depends on our availability that particular year and if we re even seeing each other to begin with . we don t place much importance in commercialized holidays like that .","298109":"they work for some people , but not for others . it takes a high level of dedication , trust , and commitment for two people to be in a successful long distance relationship , and it s sometimes more difficult to be long distance than if you were in a relationship where you saw one another often . personally speaking , i could never be in a long distance relationship . i need to be able to see my partner frequently for my own needs .","298110":"the rankings are pointless in my opinion , because they re basically telling other users that their friends are earning more coins than them , but we still don t know the purpose of these coins in the first place .","298111":"it has to do with consent when women wear bikinis , they re consenting to being seen in such attire as it s their own personal choice . being stumbled upon in your undergarments , however , does not include consent , which is why women make a huge deal out of being seen in them .","298112":"i use the hour clock .","298113":"no , i m not patriotic .","298114":"i just tried recording a video , but it doesn t work for me . idk my voice is sorta neutral , not high pitched but not really low either . i m also sorta monotone .","298115":"stayed awake with me , despite them needing to be asleep , because i was going through a mental health crisis and they wanted to ensure my safety . i don t talk to this person often anymore because we grew apart in recent years , but i ll always appreciate their dedication and compassion .","298116":"everyone has a different purpose or reason for existing . and often times , we go through life trying to find that purpose within ourselves . i ve always gone by the notion of the purpose of life is to create a life with purpose .","298117":"they them are my pronouns . just because it doesn t bother me if people refer to me as different pronouns doesn t mean that my actual pronouns are insignificant . i included them in my bio so that people who are new to my page are aware that that s how they should refer to me .","298118":"i think it s alarming that it just became law . i already explained my stance on abortion in a previous , similar answer i m pro choice , so i believe that the ohio law is incredibly radical and uninformed . most people do not know that they re even pregnant by six weeks time that s only two weeks after a missed period . and regardless of whether or not a heartbeat can be determined , six weeks is lightyears prior to when a fetus is actually viable .","298119":"the most difficult goodbye was seeing my boyfriend s mother s face for the very last time during the wake when she passed away in . i only knew her for less than a year at that point , but it was difficult because of the devastating impact her passing had on the rest of the family . her death was not deserved , and she still had so many fruitful years ahead of her .","298120":"i m not a parent . however , i would say that keeping their child safe and allowing them to flourish is perhaps the single most important duty of a parent . when you re a parent , your child s safety , happiness , and wellbeing come first and foremost .","298121":"my relationship . initially i was going to say my job , but jobs will always come and go the relationships you make with other people are so much more substantial and meaningful , and i value my current relationship so much . my job is obviously incredibly important to me and is a significant aspect of my life , but my relationship with my boyfriend is perhaps the single most important thing in my life right now .","298122":"i would choose to change my commute to and from work so that it isn t as much of a hassle every morning and evening . it takes me an hour each way , and it completely drains me mentally , especially since driving increases my anxiety to begin with .","298123":"if i had to choose just one material possession , i would likely pick a painting that my boyfriend commissioned someone to do last year for me the artist is actually a good friend of ours . the painting came out beautiful and it s a true testament to my boyfriend s love for me , because he had it made during a troubling time in my life .","298124":"i find that artist is more all encompassing , because writing isn t the only creative endeavor i have . i also draw , paint , and do photography .","298125":"not the same sort of god that s portrayed in other religions , no . buddhism doesn t have a belief in a personal god , in particular . i don t remember much about hinduism , though .","298126":"nicotine and caffeine . i also recently acknowledged that i have a problem with alcohol that i ve been trying to work hard on overcoming .","298127":"i don t really care about what other people do or what their beliefs are , personally speaking . if someone doesn t believe in gender identity and refuses to use a trans person s pronouns , then that s something they have to handle on their own . unfortunately , you cannot expect everyone to respect you solely for existing , and there will always be people who will disagree with you , whether that disagreement is regarding someone s opinions , gender identity , sexual orientation , etc etc . i m not bothered if people misgender me , for example , but i know plenty of other trans non binary people who are greatly troubled by it .","298128":"courtney is one of my closest friends i feel like i can tell her anything going on in my life , and she s always willing to listen to my troubles and give her input when necessary . she s nonjudgmental and is always willing to offer her help in any way she can , and i appreciate her so , so much .","298129":"artist , survivor , and addict .","298130":"my pillbox . lmao . guess i m fighting zombies with an arsenal of psychiatric medication .","298131":"unhinged , expressive , and sometimes vindictive .","298132":"one more light by linkin park https www . youtube . com watch ? v tm lgxtltqk","298133":"it depends on how hot humid it is on that particular day . if it s chilly or comfortable outside , then i prefer sunshine . however , if the temperature is over degrees fahrenheit , then i prefer cloudy weather .","298134":"i prefer rain over snow . although i do find both weather patterns to be very relaxing . i just get very nervous driving in the snow however , i can handle the rain just fine .","298135":"i don t really eat sandwiches often . however , i do enjoy going to subway and getting a blt with avocado spread and cheese usually on an italian herb cheese bread .","298136":"not really , no . everyone gossips to some extent , whether they realize it or not . i think it borderlines on bad behavior when you re gossiping about a person to the point where you re spreading harmful or toxic rhetoric about a person that simply isn t true , because that s slander at that point .","298137":"it isn t a law , it was just a proposed bill that doesn t seem like it s going to go anywhere whew ! . in short , the bill proposed that people should be charged with homicide if they get an abortion , which implies the death penalty in the state of texas . i m pro choice , so of course i disagree highly with the bill entirely . i believe that people have the right to get an abortion because a fetus is not viable outside of the womb until much , much later in pregnancy , and even people who have abortions after x amount of weeks only do so in dire medical emergencies . abortions should be covered , even if partially , under health insurance as well .","298138":"thank you , kittie ! ! i hope you have a great weekend too . i don t have any real plans , no . like every weekend , i am going to work on some freelance writing and do household chores , but those aren t exactly plans , lol .","298139":"i simply didn t believe in what i was being taught , so i told my parents that i wasn t going to attend religion classes or church anymore because i didn t believe in the existence of god .","298140":"gender non conforming , to my understanding , is just a synonym for people who are genderfluid , non binary , transgender , etc etc . at least that s the way i ve always personally seen it used . i don t think it has anything to do with social desires , otherwise someone would be labeled a transtrender or whatever the term is for someone who s pretending to be trans when really they re just not ascribing to gender stereotypes , lol .","298141":"i actually had a pretty good day . the ceo of the company took a look at the draft of the project i ve been working on alongside the graphic designer , and she s extremely pleased with the way it s coming out . that gave me a lot of relief because i was worried that she wasn t going to like it . i also received a bonus today because my supervisor received a favorable testimonial regarding one of the assignments i worked on months ago ! !","298142":"i m not religious , no . i was raised to believe in catholicism , but i denounced the religion when i was a teenager . i did go through stages where i experimented with other religions , particularly buddhism and hinduism , but i don t believe in organized religion in the present day .","298143":"no , i wouldn t do stand up comedy . i have social anxiety and i get extremely nervous and panicked when i m around groups of people , especially in settings where the spotlight is on me .","298144":"i actually just did a quick google search on gender dysphoria , and i was slightly wrong what they did remove upon the release of the dsm was gender identity disorder and replaced it with gender dysphoria , basically because they re portraying that being gender non conforming isn t a disorder in itself . however , gender dysphoria is described as feelings of significant distress associated with gender , and the distress someone feels is disordered .","298145":"i thought they took that out of the dsm , though ? ? i could be wrong , i haven t looked it up in a long time .","298146":"the entire purpose of askfm is to ask questions , so yeah . that doesn t guarantee i ll answer , though .","298147":"decided to check out billie eilish , i really dig this song . bury a friend https youtu . be huhc tyz ik","298148":"saying something as absolute as all x people are y is inherently wrong by default , lol . there are trans people with mental illness , just like there are cis people with mental illness . it isn t a prerequisite to being trans to be mentally ill .","298149":"i m open to answering most questions , as long as they re not sexual , trolling , inappropriate , or invasive .","298150":"i m all right . i ve been stressed recently , but the past two days haven t been terrible . i m finally getting a grasp on what i m doing at work and things are going smoothly .","298151":"it would be a fictional novel with themes regarding death , mental illness , addiction , interpersonal relationships , etc etc . it would probably also delve into things like gangs , drugs , trafficking , stuff like that .","298152":"i would probably punch a wall if my alarm suddenly turned into baby shark without my knowledge .","298153":"i have quite a few hobbies writing , playing video games , reading , painting , listening to music , and photography .","298154":"throwback to one of my favorite creatures .","298155":"yes , i have an instagram account . however , it s private .","298156":"i have quite a few pictures on my profile that you can view .","298157":"listening to music and answering questions .","298158":"i can always go for spam . i may not answer them right away , though . i still have a lot of questions in my inbox , but i always like having more in case i get bored over the weekend .","298159":"i sleep a lot actually , lol .","298160":"i haven t really been in much trouble . i had to appear in court for a summons because my friends and i were trespassing when we were much younger , but nothing came of the situation at all . i ve been fortunate in that although i ve done a lot of really dumb and sh tty things , i was never caught for those actions .","298161":"depression itself wouldn t cause anxiety attacks having an anxiety disorder , or traits of an anxiety disorder , would cause anxiety attacks . depression and anxiety are highly comorbid , though , and often the two are diagnosed together if the symptoms present themselves .","298162":"this doesn t make much sense to me because if someone didn t believe in a gender spectrum , then they probably wouldn t use a trans person s correct pronouns . if they did use a person s correct pronouns and was conscious that the trans person went by those pronouns , then that indicates a greater respect for that individual than previously thought . i think it is transphobic for people to think that being trans is a mental illness , though . there s no correlation between having a mental illness and being trans .","298163":"perhaps it doesn t matter to you personally , but you can t speak on behalf of everyone . gender is important to myriad different people .","298164":"if you scroll down a few hours , i explained what non binary meant already .","298165":"it could perhaps be a precursor to why the individual behaves the way they currently do , and it could also serve as a warning for the potential partner to look out for red flags .","298166":"depends on the individual in question . it s difficult to really group all people who cheat into one category because every situation is different and some people outgrow the tendency , while others don t .","298167":"there s no comparison between the two concepts , actually . but whatever helps you sleep at night .","298168":"i was fortunate in that i didn t really have to study in order to do well in my courses .","298169":"no , there s nothing appealing about it to me .","298170":"it s a crucial sense of a person s identity . if someone is more content with themselves or understands themselves more because they discovered a gender identity that speaks to them on an intimate level , then that s a good thing .","298171":"no , i wouldn t believe so . i ve never left the united states , and i think it would benefit me if i visited other countries and overall had a genuine vacation .","298172":"i d like to travel out of the country eventually .","298173":"gender isn t meaningless , no .","298174":"male female refers to sex , while man woman refers to gender .","298175":"technically your chromosomes determine your sex . but your sex is different from your gender . i m sure there s a lot you don t know , i don t know who you are .","298176":"the weather was a bit chilly today , but not cold enough to where i needed to put on another layer i was already wearing a thin hoodie . it s also been gray all day , which is one of my favorite types of weather .","298177":"oh , don t worry ! ! it s perfectly fine . i m trying to be more open about it either way while it s still something that s sensitive to me , i do want to talk about it more for my own sake , it helps me cope when i can discuss things .","298178":"i m not a vegan or a vegetarian , but i also don t really eat meat very much . the majority of my food intake is vegetables and starches , and i only eat a small serving of meat if i do have it .","298179":"i was in such a rush to get out the door this morning that i didn t have many thoughts when i looked in the mirror . i was mainly checking to see that everything looked fine before i went outside .","298180":"non binary means that the subject does not adhere to either of the two binaries in the case of gender , that means man or woman . to be non binary insinuates that your gender falls somewhere in between , and whether or not people want to further label their gender is entirely up to them .","298181":"no , there s nothing to fear about death . it s part of the natural cycle of life and there s no avoiding it .","298182":"if i had a dollar for every time someone told this to me , i would be quite wealthy .","298183":"no , my family never does anything for easter . it isn t an important holiday to us .","298184":"i think the recent photos are an amazin scientific breakthrough ,

town .","298191":"i like my eggs fried and on a croissant .","298192":"it s really funny because in your question , you described me exactly . prior to attempting this whole sobriety trip , i drank excessively , but at the same time , i also tried to eat healthy and maintained good skincare , lmao . it obviously doesn t outweigh the damage it did to my liver , but it did make me feel better .","298193":"i feel attacked right now . lmao . i don t really have any feelings towards people like that in general . like , i used to binge drink multiple nights per week but try to actively take care of other aspects of my health , so i m not really an authority of what people should do . as long as they have their best interests in mind and exhibit self control , then i see no issue .","298194":"i really love ariana grande s music i have no idea why because it s so different from what i normally listen to .","298195":"i don t watch or play sports .","298196":"i don t know what that term means . but i would allow my boyfriend to have sex with other people as long as we both agreed on who the other person was and he effectively communicated his feelings , yes .","298197":"greeting cards for birthdays , holidays , etc etc . they re always utterly useless because the recipient reads them for seconds , laughs , and then throws the card in the garbage . it s a waste of money .","298198":"misphire posted a selfie on social media recently i thought she was gorgeous in it . xxx","298199":"it s always been difficult for me to let go of old mindsets and toxic habits . i can move on from people easily enough , but my own personal dilemmas and routines have always been hard for me to move on from .","298200":"i m in a monogamous relationship , so cheating in my own personal opinion and based on my own ideologies would perhaps be if my partner went behind my back and developed a romantic or sexual relationship with another person without telling me , or asking me , about it first . i m at the stage of my life where i m comfortable and secure in my relationship , and if i wasn t satisfying my partner on a sexual level , for example , then i would be perfectly fine if he went out and sought that satisfaction elsewhere , as long as him and i communicated extensively about the excursion first and he still returned to me and respected me as his partner . every relationship is different though , there are open and polyamorous relationships as well as monogamous relationships . what constitutes as cheating depends entirely on the couple themselves , and some people may have more tolerance than others .","298201":"i wouldn t even know where to begin with this question . there are some things which are simple to us now , i . e . fire , the wheel , etc etc . and there are also things such as the internet which are more complex that have had a resounding influence on the way the world works too .","298202":"aw . i didn t know that !

.","298208":"no . i probably should back up my photographs and writing that i have saved on my laptop , but i haven t gotten around to it yet .","298209":"i m actually okay today which is a relief because the past week has been nothing but stressful . i had a meeting with my coworker and supervisor this morning regarding my responsibilities undertaking this new project , and i feel much better about the tasks at hand now that we cleared the air . for those who don t know , i got a promotion at work and have been taking on a new , big project as sole administrator . the person previously in charge of the project left for maternity leave , so i m filling in until she returns .","298210":"i gave my old laptop to my best friend s mother after i received my new laptop there wasn t much wrong

favorite movies .","298225":"stability , whether that s financial stability or emotional stability . i d take either at this point in my life .","298226":"that happened today , actually . i have this one coworker who keeps coming up to me with questions and suggestions regarding the project i m working on , and today he said to me , how has specific task been going along ? and i had to take a step back because i thought that task was actually his job , not mine . needless to say , i scheduled a meeting for tomorrow morning with him and my boss so that i can get a concise idea of what exactly my responsibilities are regarding this new project .","298227":"idk , probably in either vermont , new hampshire , west virginia , or south carolina . the cost of living isn t as expensive in those states compared to where i currently live , and i would very much enjoy the weather and scenery .","298228":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","298229":"your english is great ! ! and i m glad i made you feel this way .","298230":"i was just outside having a cigarette . i m currently sitting in my room on my laptop , just scrolling through social media .","298231":"lately i ve been listening to matt maeson . he s a wonderful singer songwriter . i just don t care that much https www . youtube . com watch ? v bahct hbgq","298232":"i think spanish and russian are a few of the most beautiful languages . the way they sound is mesmerizing .","298233":"i wish i knew more of the spanish language so that i could communicate better with my boyfriend s family at times . i really don t know why i didn t choose to take spanish classes when i was in high school . i also wish i knew how to speak russian . i think it s a beautiful language .","298234":"the only language i currently speak is english . however , i know a few words of spanish thanks to my boyfriend s family . in addition , i took four years of french courses while i was in high school .","298235":"my first language was english .","298236":"in the united states , i believe english is the most common first language with spanish coming in second .","298237":"i unfollowed someone the other day because they weren t very active anymore , and i simply wasn t interested in their answers . i followed someone else the other day so that i can see their responses to some boiling hot tea , but they wound up deactivating . oh well .","298238":"yes , i ve been heartbroken in the past . it would be difficult to find someone my age who hasn t experienced heartbreak at least once in their lives .","298239":"yes , i know someone in my life who fits this exact description . whenever they re behaving wrongly and is basically an assh le to everyone around them , no one calls them out which only further encourages their behavior . they re never held accountable for their words or actions and it s gotten to their head .","298240":"fireworks are too noisy for me , and they always make me incredibly jumpy , anxious , and paranoid .","298241":"leaving my last job . it was a difficult decision because i was promised compensation if i stuck around until the company s last day before closing , but i was also very unhappy there and quitting was ultimately for the best . i ended up finding a much better job my current job , and i m x happier here than i ever was at my last job .","298242":"the only dreams i can remember at this stage are nightmares . and they re too gruesome to really explain in detail .","298243":"i ve only ever heard of avicii , and even so , i don t even know any songs by them . lmao .","298244":"i wouldn t know , considering i don t know how creative other people may or may not be . creativity isn t a competition .","298245":"i m not the right resource to go to if you want to discuss furries . lmao .","298246":"yes , i ve always been a creative person . since i was a pre teen , i ve been writing , painting , drawing , delving into photography , etc etc .","298247":"no , i prefer psychological thrillers lol . my favorite movies are usually dark comedy or gritty action movies .","298248":"i show my love through expressing my feelings towards him on a regular basis , and i ll occasionally buy him something and make a cute little gift basket of his favorite things for him if i know he s having a particularly hard day .","298249":"aw , this is so sweet . thank you very much","298250":"yes , i m quite the romantic . i value small tokens of love from my boyfriend , things as seemingly insignificant as our daily phone conversations when he s driving home from work . i look forward to those talks more than anything .","298251":"furry , you say ? ? dovbts","298252":"if someone were to simply look at me , they probably wouldn t expect me to have multiple mental illnesses that make me struggle with daily life . i m pretty high functioning when it comes to my mental health , except when i m under great bouts of stress .","298253":"if you don t have anything productive to add to this conversation , i m just going to end up deleting these sorts of responses .","298254":"unfortunately , i haven t left the united states .","298255":"i don t have a formula to my life . honestly , i m just winging it and hoping for the best possible outcome each time .","298256":"uh , perhaps buy them the ap stylebook or strunk white s the elements of style .","298257":"yes , it did . it means that you cannot make me laugh .","298258":"i just find it amusing how i m presenting the anon with logic regarding beauty and opinions , but they still believe they re going somewhere with their you re ugly comments . lmao . but thank you , i appreciate it","298259":"i don t have an opinion on beyonce . i know nothing about her .","298260":"i haven t been in a laughing mood in a while . if i m not in a humorous mood , then nothing really has the capability of making me laugh .","298261":"yes , you ve stated this opinion several times now . lmfao .","298262":"no , it isn t the truth . realistically , there s no such thing as fact vs fiction when it comes to something as subjective as what a person finds beautiful or ugly . your opinion may be that my face is ugly , but that doesn t make it a definitive truth . it s simply an opinion .","298263":"this is actually the opposite of what i just said . lmao .","298264":"i started re watching season of game of thrones last night , if that counts for anything . the new , and final , season begins next sunday , so i want to catch myself up on what happened last year before starting season .","298265":"this perspective is actually contrary to the general consensus . regardless , your opinion doesn t matter much and you should perhaps be grateful that this face belongs to me , not you .","298266":"i ve watched p rn before in the past , if that s what you re referring to . i haven t had a need to watch it in several years , though , and these days i m not supportive of the p rn industry .","298267":"another selfie from this past weekend","298268":"thank you so much it feels nice to be understood like this , not gonna lie . i have the support of my boyfriend , and he s been incredible lately with his encouragement and words of affirmation , but i ve also been hesitant to talk about it because it s such a sensitive topic for me rn . i hope you have a nice night too","298269":"honestly , i m not doing too great rn . i had a really difficult day at work , and i feel completely stressed out and exhausted even though i m home now . i m not looking forward to the rest of the week , and all i want to do is see my boyfriend but i don t think i ll be seeing him until tomorrow or wednesday night .","298270":"aw , thank you","298271":"thank you . it s been a difficult few weeks , especially considering i was coming from a position where i was drinking most nights of the week . so to restrict myself to having virtually nothing i went out to a restaurant and ordered a cocktail on friday , but that s been it , it s been hard and only made me realize that it definitely was a borderline problem for me .","298272":"i definitely enjoy beer , but i started drinking too often and it wasn t good for my health . and the beer i used to drink has a lot of calories in it , so now when i allow myself to have a drink , i ll have a low calorie cocktail instead of a beer .","298273":"no , i wasn t online when you sent this to me . i was at work five hours ago .","298274":"aw , thank you ! !","298275":"thank you","298276":"lately i ve been having iced coffee with sugar free vanilla syrup and either half n half or soy milk . however , i had a horrible day at work so i just treated myself to a chocolate cherry cold brew from dunkin , and it s really good .","298277":"i used to drink beer , but i ve recently restricted myself from having it . i used to drink ipas .","298278":"no . like i ve stated on askfm on several occasions now , i don t watch or play any sports .","298279":"no , i don t follow you .","298280":"i don t follow too many people to begin with , and everyone i follow is at least over the age of . i have a few people whom i follow who are between , but most of them are in their early to mid s or older than me .","298281":"new selfie","298282":"no , having hardship or struggling with mental illness isn t an excuse to be cruel to others , especially if that person is willfully trolling other people . you don t get a pass for being a toxic person just because you have a mental illness , because you still know right from wrong behavior . and yes , if someone i was friends with had harmful or offensive opinions or views , then i would stop being their friend in light of that . i don t have room in my life for people who want to intentionally hurt others or aren t willing to see the error of their ways .","298283":"i don t use emojis very often , but i ll sometimes use ? at the end of sentences .","298284":"i m neither at the moment . i m just existing .","298285":"i haven t eaten anything yet today . it s only am , haha .","298286":"i m not really a snacker , but if i want to waste money on junk food , then i ll normally buy cheez its .","298287":"no , i m not a big fan of dancing .","298288":"the internet is an information library , where the people who use the internet don t utilize the abundance of resources at their fingertips in order to suit their own gains .","298289":"lol . ugh , i can t envision myself enduring another five days in a row of this stress . the only thing keeping me going is that when i see my boyfriend during the week , he said he ll buy some firewood and we can have a fire since it s supposed to be warm finally this week ! !","298290":"i m tired and i want to go to sleep . however , i don t want tomorrow to come so i m trying my hardest to stay awake longer , lmao . god why am i like this","298291":"if your parents control your finances and say you re not allowed to have a credit card , then you should listen to your parents considering they know you best of all . talk to them about why they don t want you to have one then take the necessary steps to earn their trust , whether that s by getting a job , taking on more responsibility for your bills , etc etc .","298292":"visit misphire and her family ! ! i m sure they would show me to a few quaint spots .","298293":"i m not in a good mood exactly , but i m not in a bad mood either . i m just existing .","298294":"yeah , weather patterns have become more severe in the past few years compared to a decade or so ago . blizzards are worse and the heat during the summer is also much hotter and more humid .","298295":"i don t feel positive or negative about the future because so much of it is uncertain . although i believe climate change is a bigger threat to us than ourselves . what we ve done to wreck havoc on the environment not only affects us , but also other ecosystems , and eventually its going to turn deadly .","298296":"certain people in my life , for the most part . i only speak to them on an as needed basis .","298297":"some people perhaps are , but not everyone .","298298":"war , slavery , genocide , etc etc . it s apparent in history since the dawn of time .","298299":"violence is ingrained in us . we were all born out of violence and raised seeing violence , through war and captivity and other atrocities .","298300":"i m all right not too great , but also not terrible . i m just passing the time by watching game of thrones to prepare for the season premiere next week .","298301":"considering i m a human being , yeah . we all belong to humanity .","298302":"no , i m not high .","298303":"there is no advantage to having the capability to express violence because it puts people s lives at stake .","298304":"humanity in general is violent . this is only exemplified more in american culture because people have more freedom to express their violence .","298305":"favorite tyrion lannister or arya stark . least favorite joffrey baratheon .","298306":"i haven t read the books yet , even though i own them . honestly , i m under the assumption that everyone is going to die . lmao .","298307":"thanks , i appreciate it","298308":"? ? ? courrtana is indeed a real friend of mine , especially considering we talk nearly every day . she s not an irl friend , though , because i consider irl friends to be people i ve met through school , work , etc etc .","298309":"me and courrtana only hung out twice , unfortunately . it would be wonderful to see her again , but i thought the previous anon was talking about my irl friends exclusively , not my friends whom i ve met online .","298310":"i don t watch any form of sports , which also includes wrestling .","298311":"no . i m content with the people in my life .","298312":"when i m depressed , what i need is support from close friends and my boyfriend . however , when i m in that state , i self isolate to the point where i don t even text anyone or really use social media because i don t want anyone to know that i m doing badly .","298313":"i don t care what you do .","298314":"lol . i can t record videos for askfm . either way , that is definitely not something i would be willing to do .","298315":"no , i ve never recorded my voice for any voicemail even for my own cell phone .","298316":"i ve never really fully understood the meaning of the term stan , but regardless , kain isn t an abusive person i ve been friends with him for years and he s been nothing but a wholesome , supportive friend . idk what sort of drama you re attempting to make out of him rn , but it s utterly pointless . if you genuinely cared about him , then you would message him privately instead of sending his to random people on the internet .","298317":"i only enjoy the brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts . i like them fresh out of the toaster , but room temperature is fine too .","298318":"i have my funny moments , sure .","298319":"no . if happiness was a choice , then people would simply choose to be happy instead of suffering with a range of negative emotions that comes alongside being human . happiness is a mindset , but it s also affected by your upbringing as well as your genetic makeup . some people cannot experience happiness unless they re treated with therapy or medication or have to take extra vitamins , etc etc . happiness is a much more complex emotion than it appears to be .","298320":"my advice to someone who wanted to date me would be to abandon their feelings because their efforts would ultimately be futile .","298321":"haha , thank you honestly , though , i feel super lucky to have him . i m an extremely difficult person to deal with handle , and i have an entire bundle of baggage that comes with not just dating me , but also being my friend . i m grateful that he knows how to handle my mental illnesses and still remains a reassuring and encouraging figure in my life , who also doesn t sugarcoat anything or bullsh t me regarding my behavior .","298322":"i use snapchat to talk to a few friends every day , but i wasn t aware that there were new updates .","298323":"i wouldn t really be able to put it on a scale . i love him more than i love myself at times , though , and i would be willing to sacrifice my own comfort and happiness if it meant that it made his life easier although i know he would strictly object to that .","298324":"i try my hardest to help my close friends boyfriend whenever i possibly can . often i ll put my own concerns on the back burner while i help them because i believe that their issues are more important than mine .","298325":"no , not on purpose at the very least . i can t say that it definitely hasn t happened because i wouldn t be surprised if something like that happened against my knowledge , but it isn t something i ve ever done intentionally to cause harm to a friendship .","298326":"yes , burning matches campfires are two of my favorite scents ! ! i absolutely cannot wait for the weather to get a little warmer so that i can start having fires in the backyard again .","298327":"not really , no . if i m incapable of doing something , then i have no problem with informing that person that i can t do whatever it is they want me to do . however , i do try my best to make the most of every situation and do what i can if someone needs help .","298328":"no , i m not a gullible person . i don t trust most people in general , so it s difficult for me to accept what other people say as true without doing my own research into it myself .","298329":"i do have a wishlist , but i don t post it publicly for anyone to see because i m afraid of people seeing my personal information on there . i mainly use it to keep track of things i want to eventually buy , though .","298330":"i use uber sometimes , but i ve never used lyft before .","298331":"according to multiple pottermore quizzes , i belong to slytherin house .","298332":"i don t use amazon often considering i don t shop very often , but when i do need something , i ll see if amazon has it for a cheaper price than other retailers .","298333":"lol . part of the reason why i made that photo poll is because i m often switching preferences between light dark aesthetics , and i was wondering how everyone else felt about them as well .","298334":"the worst feeling , in my personal experience , is despair . when you re in such disbelief that something terrible has happened that you re beyond the depths of sadness or depression , and for a while , you feel numb to it all until it hits you like a train when you least expect it .","298335":"no , i don t use the landline to make phone calls . i also don t answer the landline when it rings either .","298336":"i just made myself some lunch i m currently listening to music and going through my inbox .","298337":"i ve never seen it sold in stores , but apparently you can order it online .","298338":"yes ! ! it s actually called you re somebody else , though . https www . youtube . com watch ? v qvdph cbtn","298339":"i don t discuss things with my parents unless it s absolutely necessary , so i haven t had an argument with them in quite a while . i used to argue with my parents often when i was a teenager , though . my mother has always been quite combative and has never admitted guilt to anything , especially during times in which she s been wrong .","298340":"a charismatic person is normally quite charming in the way they speak and has a naturally mesmerizing persona upon meeting them . their stories could be compelling and inspire you to learn more about them , and they could also be particularly attractive both in appearance and in personality .","298341":"i don t play or watch any sort of sports .","298342":"i don t actively keep up with all of their music , but i do follow a few of my favorite artists on social media primarily twitter instagram so that i know when new music is coming out and if they re touring near me .","298343":"my boyfriend introduced me to a band called rainbow kitten surprise . their song devil like me is really good https www . youtube . com watch ? v shwaw vs","298344":"probably smoking cigarettes . i smoke probably cigarettes per day , and it would be beneficial to my health if i cut down on the number that i smoke .","298345":"depends entirely on the tattoo itself . you would have to see a tattoo artist for a consultation to decide what the best course of action is .","298346":"my city personally doesn t , but there are always big events happening either on the island or in new york city . recently , there was a tattoo convention in queens this past weekend that i wanted to attend , but didn t feel like commuting out there . there are also plenty of other conventions , such as new york comic con .","298347":"yes , we occasionally experience severe weather problems . most of the time , they re nor easters , blizzards , or hurricanes . we experienced hurricane sandy in , which was completely devastating to the entire island .","298348":"new york city is a tourist attraction in itself , but there isn t much on long island with respect to tourism besides wine country montauk point . there are also the hamptons , but i don t know any tourist who would want to willingly visit the hamptons unless they had a significant amount of money to spend .","298349":"the only professional sports in my area have to do with new york as a whole , not necessarily the island . you have the new york jets giants , new york rangers islanders , new york yankees mets , etc etc . i don t follow sports , so i don t have any preference . however , there are normally strong opinions around here regarding which new york team is best .","298350":"my region has issues with crime in general , and most of it has to do with ms and other gang related crimes . my town in particular has gone downhill in the past years with frequent armed robberies at banks , drug stores , s , etc etc .","298351":"lol , yes . the entire island is congested with people , so there s traffic literally everywhere . tie that into the fact that most people have road rage and believe they re entitled to the entire highway , and it makes for a wonderful commute .","298352":"i have two instances in , i took a road trip with my former roommate friend to burlington , vermont . we left massachusetts and drove for what i think was around hours through the mountains and greenery of vermont , which was absolutely beautiful . we also stopped at basically every scenic overpass to take photos . in or i don t remember , i took a road trip to upstate new york with my boyfriend and his best friend . it was a lot of fun being in the car with them because they re hilarious together , and the scenery was also beautiful going into the mountains as well .","298353":"i ve never driven any difficult vehicles the only cars i ve driven have been my own , and i m hesitant to drive anyone else s car because i wouldn t want to get into an accident . i don t believe i ve ever driven my boyfriend s car either because he has a truck , which is pretty much x the size of my own car , lol .","298354":"i suppose i exceed the speed limit every day , but it s mainly due to keeping up with traffic because everyone else speeds as well . i rarely speed if i m alone on the highway or on back roads because i m paranoid that a cop is around .","298355":"i think tailgating is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs . if you have to brake suddenly , the person tailgating you could slam into the back of your car because they weren t allowing enough space between the cars . it s one of the things that angers me on the road actually , lol . i ll see people tailgating me and it automatically makes me question their intentions , whether they re purposely trying to f ck with me or not . i usually switch over to another lane .","298356":"i drive everywhere i need to go , and i very rarely take public transportation . the only times i ll travel without my car is if i m going into new york city , during which time i ll just take the train . i ve also used uber on a few occasions as well .","298357":"no , i haven t gotten any weird ones in a while . the past few weeks , they ve all been relatively normal .","298358":"this thought crosses my mind fairly often , actually . it sometimes causes me to dissociate and question the reality and purpose of my life , as well as humanity as a whole . as a result , i try not to really think about things like this .","298359":"there isn t a defined age by which someone should get married . everyone s timeline is different , and some people are ready for marriage when they re young , while others aren t ready until they re older .","298360":"i don t care enough about disney princesses to have a favorite .","298361":"unstable . lmao .","298362":"yes , there s a landline at my house .","298363":"if you re asking this question , then you probably already have the idea in mind .","298364":"i m not a big fan of the beatles in general .","298365":"my boyfriend used to use that , actually .","298366":"i doubt it would have affected me either way .","298367":"chester and chris have played the guitar on myriad songs .","298368":"i m not currently eating anything . i m just listening to music drinking seltzer .","298369":"replace kurt cobain with scott weiland , and you ve got yourself a real supergroup

them before .","298373":"i don t use wax , lol . i m assuming that s primarily a marijuana thing .","298374":"it was good ! ! you can see a few similarities between them , but joe hill has his own unique style . the fireman wasn t exactly a thriller or horror , but it was more fantasy and dystopian .","298375":"i combined blueberry menthol vape juice in my novo tonight it tastes so yummy .","298376":"yes , i know someone like that . it used to anger me until i realized that my anger was hurting me more than it hurt them , and i learned to just deal with the situations rather than become too emotionally invested in them . granted , i still get angry sometimes but not nearly as bad as it used to be .","298377":"the last time i read a book was sometime in early , sadly . it was the fireman by joe hill stephen king s son .","298378":"either klaus hargreeves from the umbrella academy because i m obsessed with him at the moment , or lestat from the vampire chronicles .","298379":"affirmations don t necessarily help me exactly , but they re strong reminders that ground me and remind me of what i m working towards . i often find them on instagram , and i ll repost ones that i can relate to .","298380":"not on purpose , lmao .","298381":"yeah , i ve improved on my impulse control within the last few weeks , at the very least . i ve been resisting acting out on my impulses because lately they ve been detrimental to my interpersonal relationships , and i ve decreased my alcohol intake as a result because that s a major problem in my life .","298382":"klaus hargreeves , omg . i just want to protect him , my sweet lil baby . he s such a relatable , tragic character and i feel for him on so many levels .","298383":"lol . that s something i ve certainly never heard before . yes , i ve had short , blonde hair in the past .","298384":"i m not entirely sure . i find some people attractive , but not others . it depends on the way they look as a whole , as well as their personalities . i liked a variety of different people when i was in high school .","298385":"my friends aren t really my type , so it s hard to say whether they re attractive or not . i wouldn t date them if i was single because they re my friend i would want to keep that friendship .","298386":"i said in one of my previous answers that i was watching the umbrella academy .","298387":"i m not happy , but i m not upset either . i m simply content .","298388":"oh , rofl . no , i haven t watched cable in a very long time . i usually just watch whatever is on netflix although i ll have to try to remember my hbo password in a few weeks to watch game of thrones ! .","298389":"it isn t necessarily a terrible thing if you look older than years old , considering is still extremely young . i went out to dinner last night and the waitress didn t card me , so that meant she knew i was older than .","298390":"i don t even know the show you re talking about right now .","298391":"i haven t had an antennae television since i was a child , rofl .","298392":"no , i haven t been carded in a few months . then again , i go to the same two places if i want to buy alcohol so they recognize me at this point . i got carded for cigarettes the other night , but i realized it was a new cashier so he didn t recognize me obviously .","298393":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","298394":"i haven t watched mtv since the early s .","298395":"i haven t heard someone use the word cool in this context since i was in high school .","298396":"no , i don t feel the same way . i just don t believe i would be a good parent . i experience sensory overload as well , but i don t know if that would hinder my ability to be a parent or not . i also wake up between am every morning , lol .","298397":"haha , no . i rarely smoke marijuana .","298398":"no , i m just having some seltzer on ice .","298399":"anyone have any questions ? ? i m bored watching the umbrella academy","298400":"i don t foresee myself having children , at least not anytime in the distant future .","298401":"there s nothing wrong with children . i m just not the type of person who s interested in having or being around kids .","298402":"i like animals . i m not fond of children .","298403":"you don t have to , but if i m paying in cash then i ll give him a dollar or two

was . i ve had my current car since .","298406":"both , depending on my mood . there s a full service station really close to my house that i ll go to sometimes , but mostly i pump my own gas .","298407":"yes , i ve owned a car since i was years old .","298408":"i ve been in a relationship for nearly years , so yeah .","298409":"honestly , i usually just try to sleep the feelings away and hope for a better day . start fresh with a new perspective the following morning and go from there . i used to act out , engage in self destructive behavior , and generally be a reckless person , but i m trying not to be that way anymore . it isn t good for my health and it isn t fair to my friends .","298410":"do i seem like the wolf of wall street type to you ? ? rofl . i mean , i would care about the assassination , but i don t know what i would have even done to stop it either . it was out of everyone s control .","298411":"i suppose so ! ! i find her attractive .","298412":"no , if i hated it then i simply wouldn t give advice to people , lol . i enjoy helping people .","298413":"no problem ! ! i hope everything works out well","298414":"i don t know him , so i honestly can t say . everyone is different , so everyone will heal at different rates . sometimes , people feel as if they cannot heal at all . it s a conversation you would have to have with him at some point .","298415":"lately i ve been in the mood for tacos or sushi . i had tacos last night for dinner i might eat the leftovers i took home for dinner tonight , lol . i still had one taco and rice beans left over .","298416":"it s easy to get frustrated , but you have to remember that it s going to take him time to open up and allow himself to be vulnerable around you . just try to remain patient and understanding with him . the last thing he needs is a partner who s pushy for information and won t allow him to heal on his own terms .","298417":"she s conventionally attractive , but she personally isn t my type .","298418":"no , i don t own either of those . the only console i own is an xbox one .","298419":"no . i don t generally play horror games , so i have no reason to be jumpy .","298420":"it isn t summer where i live yet . summer begins in june .","298421":"no . i also stated this in my previous answer regarding this topic .","298422":"i don t believe i have , no . i m pretty sure i ve only seen the first purge movie .","298423":"i never owned one to begin with , as i stated in my previous answer regarding this topic .","298424":"ask me questions , friends ! ! i m bored af . ask me about controversial opinions mental illnesses my hobbies video games , reading , writing , photography , art education career endeavors cosmetics relationships","298425":"i have no intentions of meeting anyone from askfm anyway aside from a friend or two who rarely use this site anymore .","298426":"no , it isn t selfish . you cannot force yourself to love someone , and if you re having doubts about your relationship , you cannot ignore those signs . you shouldn t settle for someone because you feel obligated to be with them , and as much as ending things with him will hurt , you do deserve to be content in your relationships . understandably he puts his child first because that s how parenthood works . but if you re not emotionally ready or committed to accept that sort of thing , then there s nothing wrong with that at all .","298427":"no , i don t own either of those .","298428":"thank you very much","298429":"thank you . right now , it s blue you can see it in my other profile picture .","298430":"this should last me a while , lmao .","298431":"i think it depends on the severity of the message or photo , especially if the person sending the messages is threatening you in some form which often happens when you reject those messages . honestly , if it happened to me i would just report block the person sending those messages or photos .","298432":"hello do you have a question ? ?","298433":"my hair isn t like that anymore it s a picture from last year from when my hair was pink and much shorter than it is now .","298434":"thank you","298435":"the desire to better myself and obtain happiness motivates me . i want to be the best version of myself that i can be , and the only way i can accomplish that is by continuously working toward my goals and finding the self motivation to put in percent every day .","298436":"no , an abundance of unfairness doesn t mean that it s fair to those who experience hardship . regardless of how prevalent it is to see people with bad luck or experiencing struggle in their lives , it doesn t make the things that happen to them any more fair .","298437":"insanity is perhaps the wrong word to use in this context , because mental illness is particularly manifested as a result of both environmental factors and genetic predispositions , as well as the abundance or lack thereof of certain chemicals in the brain . anger rage is a natural human emotion which occurs moreso in some individuals than others , and i also believe that emotion is influenced by both a person s upbringing and their genetics . some people are more quick to anger than others .","298438":"i don t usually eat pizza , but i enjoy grandma pizza with vodka sauce , spinach broccoli white pizza , and margherita pizza fresh basil , sliced tomatoes , and fresh mozzarella .","298439":"i prefer cooler weather over the heat . i cannot stand the heat , especially considering it becomes so humid where i live .","298440":"i don t ask people questions generally , and if i do , then i only ask the people whom i follow . however , i m doing fine . i m currently working on some freelance assignments for work to get some extra cash and listening to music . i have the window open and there s a nice breeze it s putting me in a good mood .","298441":"i m currently watching myself type on my laptop screen . i don t have anything playing in the background aside from video game soundtracks from youtube .","298442":"i prefer beer over liquor . but if i drink which thankfully has been rare lately , i ve been sticking to liquor because there are less calories in liquor compared to the beer i used to drink .","298443":"i listen to the skyrim soundtrack while i m writing . i found this hour long video that layers the sound of rain over the soundtrack it s super relaxing . https www . youtube . com watch ? v wpg tnewmo t s","298444":"no . the length of your hair isn t correlated with your sexual orientation , lol .","298445":"it isn t something that crosses my mind , and i ve only purchased vodka maybe four or five times in my entire life .","298446":"i don t really know what tithe means , but whenever i go out , i always give a percent tip .","298447":"that seems a bit odd . unless your friend is strapped for money and desperately needs it , i don t really see a reason why she would ask you to pay back for the plate you broke unless it was a really expensive plate or something . do you know how much she s asking for ? ? depending on how much it is , i may pay her back just to keep the friendship amicable . however , if the plate is super expensive , i would question why she suddenly wants you to pay for it . especially if you re low on cash too .","298448":"this rarely happens to me . however , when it happened in the past , i would just ignore them .","298449":"somewhat . i did well in my science classes when i was in high school and college .","298450":"this picture is the epitome of me","298451":"it frustrates me when people talk over me when i m in the middle of speaking , or they respond to what i m saying with something that s completely irrelevant to the conversation showing that they probably weren t even listening . i find that a lot of people talk just to hear themselves speak or revert the conversation so that they can talk about themselves , instead of listening and responding to what s actually being discussed .","298452":"i used to play all of those games , yeah ! !","298453":"yes , i m currently experiencing this now at my job . the administrator of one of the programs my company offers went on maternity leave , so she elected me to take over her program while she s gone for three months . i received little training because it was on such short notice , so i was basically thrown into the program and suddenly found myself responsible for making major decisions that i was previously unaware of . i m slowly getting used to it , since it s been a week since i officially took over the program , but it s still overwhelming to me and i have to take it hour by hour in order to not stress myself out more .","298454":"for my birthday in , my boyfriend bought us tickets to a wine tasting event at the local aquarium , as well as booked us a room in a nearby hotel for the weekend . it was one of the most fun birthdays i ever had , and also one of the most relaxing . the wine tasting event was wonderful we got to look at all of the fish at night when the aquarium was closed , and there were at least different vineyard vendors offering free samples of wine . there was also live music and a big buffet upstairs of different crackers , cheese , and spreads .","298455":"i always enjoyed playing the mortal kombat games , if that s considered old school . the first game came out in .","298456":"i left work early this past wednesday , if that counts for anything . due to the importance of the projects i ve recently taken on , i ve been extremely stressed and overwhelmed , especially in light of the lack of training i received prior to becoming the sole administrator of these projects . i had an anxiety attack at work on wednesday and couldn t handle being there , so i left early to clear my head .","298457":"at my worst , i can be rather spiteful . however , it is something that i m continuously working on because toxic emotions such as spite do more harm to the person experiencing that emotion . it isn t healthy or productive to hold onto those feelings .","298458":"i don t believe that people are born on this earth with a purpose already ingrained into their being . on the other hand , we all create our own purposes through life experiences . we eventually come to realize what makes us feel the most fulfilled in our lives , and our purpose then is to move forward with those goals in an effort to help ourselves or someone else .","298459":"people with mental illness are not inherently manipulative , violent , or abvsive , and they deserve compassion and understanding . the lgbtq community deserves the same equal rights that cishet people experience . abortion should be available globally for everyone who wishes to terminate a pregnancy .","298460":"the ones that have stuck in my memory are the compliments where people have compared me to lady gaga ! ! i still honestly don t

spain , australia , and the caribbean","298463":"with respect to other people , no . however , i micromanage myself to extremes at times , which can both hinder and help me .","298464":"i m more of a realist than anything else . i recognize positive and negative attributes to things , but overall i try to keep realistic outcomes in mind to situations so that i don t become overwhelmed or blindsided .","298465":"yogurt , oatmeal , sandwiches , pasta , and chicken .","298466":"yes , quite often . i m at work for nearly hours per day , and even during that time , i don t feel as if i have enough time in the day to get done what i need to do throughout the day . because i m at work for so long , it also doesn t give me enough time to run potential errands at night .","298467":"the

with the current car i have .","298473":"if you talked to both women and men , you wouldn t have said that you use this site to talk to ladies with suggestive emojis see below . regardless , it doesn t matter . if you don t have a question , then i m not responding to your messages anymore .","298474":"lmao oh please . if you re using askfm to chat solely with women , then there s a clear reason behind it . there are plenty of people like you here .","298475":"whenever i go out to eat , me and my friend split it down the middle and pay with our own respective money . however , when i m out with my boyfriend , he always insists on paying for the entire bill because we don t go out often .","298476":"i would prefer not to name restaurants since the ones local to me are unique and aren t part of a chain . there s this one mexican place close to my house that serves great tacos and quesadillas , which i might actually go to tonight with a friend .","298477":"it depends on what i m eating , because sometimes alcoholic drinks can either make or break a meal . i m more apt to order just water with most meals , unless i m ordering something like tacos or quesadillas . i also learned not to order drinks with any sort of fish dinner because that irritates my stomach .","298478":"lately i ve been obsessed with sushi . i don t go to restaurants very often at all , but there s this one local sushi restaurant that s really cute and has the best food .","298479":"yes , crowded restaurants and other public places in general bother me a lot . i don t like being surrounded by people because it makes me extremely claustrophobic and paranoid .","298480":"my day was all right not great , but it wasn t horrible either . i m currently trying to make plans to go out to dinner with a friend because i really don t want to be stuck at home tonight .","298481":"i don t have conversations on askfm , especially with people who use askfm as a dating site considering that isn t the intended purpose of the site at all . however , i ve been using askfm since or so .","298482":"i don t ask questions usually , only when i m bored my feed is rather dead . i answer questions more than anything else on here .","298483":"hello do you have a question ? ?","298484":"i don t follow people upon request .","298485":"hello do you have a question ? ?","298486":"we don t have a concrete cell phone policy , but generally speaking , it s frowned down upon to use your cell phone at your desk . if you need to use your phone , then you should step outside of the office so that you re not a distraction to everyone else .","298487":"yes , i wholeheartedly believe in love .","298488":"it s much easier to forget , in my experience . forgiveness takes a particular understanding and acceptance , and it s much more difficult to forgive a person for their mistakes than to totally erase the memory of that person from your mind .","298489":"my idea of paradise is living in a small cabin in the forest with a giant fireplace and a rustic aesthetic . where there are candles , blankets , and ambient lights in every room . where there are dogs and cats abound , alongside myself and my boyfriend . we would go outside to collect wood for the fireplace , and snow would be gently falling . we wouldn t be too far away from civilization , but enough to where we can t hear cars at night and we can see the stars as clear as daylight .","298490":"i ve lived by the ocean for my entire life , so the sea doesn t phase me anymore i hardly go seaside to begin with . however , i ve always been entranced by the mountains . every time i go to upstate new york or somewhere else in new england , i m captivated by the scenery .","298491":"no , times does not heal all wounds . some wounds are so deeply placed that while time can lessen the severity of them , they cannot heal completely .","298492":"for the most part , yes . i always feel the need to be hyperaware of my environment and keep tabs on who s coming in and out of the office at all times .","298493":"oh , not at all . lmao . i mean . . . a few years ago , i was in the legal field and dealt with a lot of medical things because the firm i worked for dealt primarily with disability benefits . so through them , i learned a lot about various illnesses .","298494":"not at all . honestly , most women who are in that industry aren t there by choice . sometimes these women feel as if they have nowhere else to turn , and considering stripping is fast money , it becomes appealing to a lot of young women .","298495":"no , i don t watch any sports .","298496":"i ve never liked her music , no . i don t remember much about her acting skills because i only watched hannah montana maybe , like , twice in my entire life .","298497":"no , lol . unless that person is your family by blood , then i think it s generally a bad omen to get someone else s name tattooed on you .","298498":"yes , i was born in .","298499":"perhaps i would , yeah . i need structure and routine to my days in order for me to feel content and stable , so i would probably at least work a part time job to pass the time and give me a sense of fulfillment .","298500":"i would rather have a coworker i disliked staying silent and distant from me . i don t like being bothered when i m working , so it would irritate me if a coworker i liked was talking non stop . i require quietness and solitude while i work .","298501":"i don t know what i would choose , tbh . i would love to work a job that i genuinely enjoyed , but if i didn t earn any money from it , then i wouldn t be able to survive . however , at least if i worked a job that i disliked and earned millions of dollars from it , i would at least live comfortably .","298502":"my dream job is to be a stay at home freelance writer , ideally writing poetry and novels . my current job is good and everything , but traveling to and from work every day exhausts me .","298503":"thankfully , no . i ve been extremely tired at work and had to force my eyes open , but i ve never actually fallen asleep .","298504":"my first job was as a cashier at a drug store .","298505":"i ve been better , but i ve also been much worse . i m at a bizarre limbo in my life right now , and i ve been simply trying to take it day by day , hour by hour , minute by minute . however , i was called into a meeting today and received my performance review , as well as a salary raise . so that made me pretty happy .","298506":"i m left handed too , actually .","298507":"realistically , no . i m the furthest from well that i ve been in a fairly long time . there s no use in denying that to myself the most ideal way of surviving something is first acknowledging that the problem exists .","298508":"i haven t eaten their food in a very long time . however , their coffee is pretty good .","298509":"tyrion lannister .","298510":"two other people live with me my parents . however , when i was living with my boyfriend for a brief period of time , there were a total of six people in the house .","298511":"i had to google this term to find out what it meant because i ve never heard of queerbaiting before . for those who don t know , it basically means situations where producers of fictional stories hint at , but don t explicitly portray , a same sex relationship , normally in an effort to appeal to the lgbtq community without actually writing lgbtq characters . with that in mind , i think it s wrong . it s detrimental to the lgbtq community because they re basically regarded as an after thought , instead of a character being explicitly written as a lgbtq character from the very start . it reminds me of what jk rowling has been doing these past few years , stating that some characters are actually gay , even though she never wrote those characters like that to begin with .","298512":"drinking caffeinated beverages all day long , lol .","298513":"i looked zevia up on amazon , which led me to find izze sparkling water on sale a count of cans is only . however , i already have cans of seltzer at my house , so i don t think i need any more rn . lmao .","298514":"i don t like anyone . however , i m in love with my boyfriend .","298515":"i have a backup account in case my current account gets banned .","298516":"no , i work in the publishing field .","298517":"i don t have a preference my boyfriend has had a beard for years now , but when we first met , he didn t have a beard . if he shaved it again , it wouldn t bother me .","298518":"i haven t ! ! this is the first i ve heard of it , actually . the flavors sound good .","298519":"bold of you to assume that i m happy with my life .","298520":"my high school memories are mostly hazy , but i know that i enjoyed the prospect of learning new things in the classroom , taking notes during lectures , and writing essays . the social component of school , i didn t enjoy so much . i had few friends and i was bullied often when i was younger .","298521":"no , i don t usually write anything down because if something is badly distressing me , then it distresses me for the duration of when i haven t seen my therapist and it ll be the first thing on my mind when i enter her office .","298522":"yes , i highly recommend therapy as long as you find the right therapist counselor who has good chemistry with you . i tried a handful of therapists before settling on my current therapist , simply because they weren t a right fit for me . but once you find someone who understands you well , therapy can make a significant difference .","298523":"dbt dialectical behavioral therapy .","298524":"if i wanted to talk about it , i would have posted it in my previous answer .","298525":"i just got back from therapy , so i m thinking about everything we discussed tonight .","298526":"i have a samsung galaxy s .","298527":"i don t watch any sports .","298528":"i had tomato soup .","298529":"fruit favorite peaches . least favorite grapefruit . vegetables favorite broccoli or spinach . least favorite celery .","298530":"i don t have an aesthetic . i just wear whatever is comfortable , which is mostly ripped skinny jeans , tank tops , long cardigans , hoodies , etc etc .","298531":"i have an android .","298532":"i prefer shorter poems because often i feel like less is more , and when you re able to convey a point through a short poem , it has a greater impact than when someone tries to convey a message with more , and often unnecessary , words . i do have a specific style that i developed over the years , but i don t really know how to explain it . it s a combination of being straightforward with hints of metaphors and intense imagery . i write the best when i m in a neutral sort of mood , which i suppose is my version of happiness . i can t write when i m upset or sad because i don t have the motivation to do anything .","298533":"the first definition i thought of was when your body is tender and you experience pain when certain areas are touched . especially in terms of infections or when you have the flu , then your whole body becomes quite tender .","298534":"raspberries and bananas .","298535":"dunkin has a blueberry glazed donut that s really good . i don t eat it often at all , though .","298536":"the crow , the shining , queen of the damned , and i am not a serial killer .","298537":"no , i don t need a planner because i already do the same things every day , lol .","298538":"thank you so much","298539":"it s easier to pay for things in cash , but debit credit cards are much more common these days .","298540":"target has packs of la croix on sale for less than . per pack , guess where i m going tomorrow .","298541":"no , i wouldn t date someone who off the bat wouldn t want to stay committed . i m in a stage of my life where i want a long term relationship that i can grow , and dating for only five months with the knowledge that they wouldn t want to continue the relationship after they move wouldn t be worth it to me .","298542":"canines , felines , rodents , and internet .","298543":"i don t personally know anyone who carries that much cash on them . you re lucky if you catch me with in cash on me at any point .","298544":"that makes no sense that she wasn t called out by fans for pretending to be pregnant as a joke . she s at fault just as much as justin beiber is , and she shouldn t be exempt from criticism for any reason . i honestly have no idea why fans weren t critical of her like they were of justin beiber . i think in this case , it s a little different from when an individual pranks their partner by pretending they re pregnant , because their partner has an emotional connection to them and it could end up hurting them a lot more .","298545":"uh , yeah . although that sounds like a dangerous thing to do regardless of where you are . there s no reason to carry that amount of cash on you . it could easily get stolen .","298546":"april fools pregnancy jokes are utterly disgusting and an insult to not only people who have had miscarriages , but who also cannot have children for a variety of reasons . it s one of the most insensitive april fools pranks ever concocted , and he shouldn t have done that in the first place . his apology was completely warranted , although i m sure his apology also wasn t good enough either .","298547":"i think people are more afraid of the inability to perceive threats in the darkness . when you re wearing night vision eyewear , although you re technically in darkness , you can still see your surroundings and can correctly perceive disturbances around you . without that ability to see , you re basically traversing your surroundings completely blind and cannot be alert to what s around you .","298548":"it depends on what sort of emotion i m feeling , and what happened in my life to prompt that feeling . i generally express my feelings openly , particularly to my boyfriend , but there are some things i bottle up because they re too shameful or concerning for me to express them without him becoming alarmed or concerned for my well being .","298549":"i dislike most kinds of condiments on food , especially mustard and mayonnaise . generally they re a well liked item . however , i actually love ranch dressing dip and will use it on pretty much everything , rofl . it s a commonly disliked condiment from my understanding .","298550":"thank you so much ! !","298551":"atlantis the lost empire and treasure planet .","298552":"november th .","298553":"i m five feet tall .","298554":"yeah , this year is our year anniversary . we ve been dating since .","298555":"i want to watch the new season of santa clarita diet eventually , if that counts for anything . i watched the first two seasons last year .","298556":"i haven t been single since i was years old , lol . prior to entering my current relationship , i was single for three years . i liked certain people , but it never went anywhere because they didn t feel the same towards me .","298557":"i think i m falling back into a depressive episode , even though i m doing everything in my power to resist it , but i can t help but feel overwhelmed and defeated in everything i do . i started crying on the ride home from work tonight and i couldn t stop , and all i ve been doing since i ve been home is listen to rainy skyrim music . i have no clue why this happened . anyway , my inbox is empty . my followers should ask me some questions to distract me tonight .","298558":"when i was in high school , i had this one friend who swore that she attracted spirits wherever she went , and she visited a children s graveyard and ended up being followed by the spirit of a young child who wouldn t leave her side . it got to the point where my friend claimed that the spirit followed her to school , and on the bus ride home , my friend would be bouncing the spirit on her knee or rocking it in her arms . it was just bizarre .","298559":"no , not that i can recall . however , i frequented an old friend s house when i was younger we both swore her house was haunted . we stupidly brought out a ouija board one night and ended up seeing an apparition , and we never used the board again . there have also been instances at my boyfriend s house that were peculiar , after his mother passed away . things randomly flying off the counter , lights flickering even though the electrical was fine , the dogs howling at night , etc etc .","298560":"i always found the folklore behind ring a ring o roses to be incredibly dark . the song is meant to be sung by children and is often taught to children from a young age , but allegedly one of the supposed meanings of the song dates back to the time of the black plague . a rash was one of the symptoms of the plague , and posies were herbs were carried as protection or to ward off the smell . eventually they would all fall down , which means that they passed away .","298561":"i found the dark to be scarier when i was younger , and i slept with a nightlight when i was a teenager . it always terrified me when i couldn t see anything in my room .","298562":"i don t believe in miracles , so no .","298563":"no , not everyone deserves forgiveness , and you shouldn t feel obligated to forgive someone at any point in your life if they hurt you terribly . everyone has different experiences and levels of tolerance , and you shouldn t be shamed for not wanting to forgive someone who hurt you if other people have forgiven their abusers .","298564":"i want to revisit all of my memories of when i went on vacations with my boyfriend . we haven t gone on a vacation in a while since we ve been so busy , and i just remember feeling so relaxed and carefree .","298565":"i d like to be able to know how to sing well . music is something i ve always been passionate about and i wish i had musical ability .","298566":"when someone is in a position of power , they feel as if they have control over someone or something else .","298567":"whether or not i feel attractive depends entirely on my mood , lol . lately i ve been feeling ugly af .","298568":"i clearly answered your question . i said it depends on my mood .","298569":"it depends on my mood that day . some days i m more confident in myself than other days . lately i ve been feeling terrible about myself .","298570":"lmfao what . this is getting trollish ridiculous now .","298571":"my only talents are drinking copious amounts of coffee in a small amount of time and writing poetry prose .","298572":"i have no desire to see the new avengers movie . i don t have anything against those movies at all since the one i did see was rather good , but it isn t something i would go out of my way to watch .","298573":"it depends on their individual personalities . i like both cats and dogs however , if i had to choose which one i would like as a pet first , i would adopt a dog .","298574":"yes , i ve taken it on numerous occasions . my personality type is infj .","298575":"my boyfriend .","298576":"by gaslighting someone else , they believe it puts them in a position of power . because they may feel powerless in some aspects of their lives , they turn to manipulative tactics against others in an effort to exert control over them so that they feel powerful in one facet of their lives . most gaslighters don t actually believe that their behavior is wrong , though . it sometimes is an innate quality about them that they ve exhibited their entire lives .","298577":"i was always fascinated by the psychology behind the behavior of ed gein . when i was in high school , i studied him extensively and did a research project on the psychological components of his actions for a forensic science class .","298578":"obviously you have the capability to do so , but you realistically should take their behavior into consideration when liking the artist or endorsing their products music etc etc . by ignoring their behavior when you continue to buy their products or listen to their music , you re essentially implying that you care more about materialism than what they ve done to hurt someone else .","298579":"i m wearing a gray tank top and a coral and navy blue striped oversized cardigan .","298580":"even if you re playing a drinking game , you still have self control . if you feel as if you cannot have another drink without feeling uncomfortable , then you have the freedom to stop playing the game .","298581":"i have a tendency to hold grudges sometimes , yeah . someone really has to anger me or hurt me in order for me to actually hold a grudge against them , though . my behavior is nevertheless a lot better now than it was in the past . i ve learned to let things go for the most part .","298582":"that s a different scenario . i assumed you meant on askfm , since i ve seen dozens of people get asked that question by random , anonymous people . if you re dating someone and you re curious about their sexual past , then i believe that it s warranted to ask them when you re both comfortable enough to discuss that topic .","298583":"depends on my mood that particular day . i mostly prefer television series because it s easier for me to pay attention to short episodes as opposed to a longer movie . but there are some movies i can watch endlessly without a problem .","298584":"yes , i make terrible life choices when i m drinking alcohol . it increases my impulsive thoughts and leads me to think irrationally and do reckless things despite the fact that it could put me in danger .","298585":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","298586":"in general , no . i don t care what total strangers think of me at all because they have no influence on my life . the only opinions i genuinely care about are those of my boyfriend and close friends .","298587":"yes , i ve used uber quite a few times , although it was only when i was going out to a bar or restaurant at night when i knew i would be drinking .","298588":"yes , i believe that s an invasive and rude question . someone else s sex life isn t any of your business .","298589":"i had a diary when i was around years old , yes . my mother sneaked into my room and read my diary when i was at school one day . ever since then , i haven t kept any diary or written documentation of my thoughts besides social media , which i can control who sees .","298590":"when i do my makeup , i sometimes contour my face . i like emphasizing my cheekbones .","298591":"like most other behavioral traits , i m sure it s a combination of environmental influence and genetics .","298592":"i cannot get over how cute this damn dog is . she was literally hugging me all night and looked at me like this whenever i wasn t paying attention to her . i m crying .","298593":"showers . i don t take baths .","298594":"lol , no . i ve never gaslit anyone before and i have no intentions of doing so .","298595":"my name is leigh . as it clearly shows on my profile , lol .","298596":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","298597":"my monday went well . i had a pretty good day at work and had a good conversation with my boyfriend when i got home . i ve been hanging out with my best friend for a few hours and we ve been catching up since i haven t seen her in a few months .","298598":"for me personally , a broken arm would be more aggravating because that means i wouldn t be able to type on my computer at work .","298599":"no , i ve never heard her music before .","298600":"yes , i know one person who gaslights others .","298601":"i don t gauge my community . lmao .","298602":"i dislike the fact that students are taught solely for the purpose of taking exams instead of actually teaching them for the purpose of education in itself . in addition , the new method of teaching basic math skills is absolutely ridiculous .","298603":"i don t know enough about where i live to really know . i m not active in the community or anything .","298604":"i ve never donated blood before , no . i can barely handle getting blood work done , lol .","298605":"haha . well , thank you .","298606":"lol , was that second adjective supposed to be an insult ? ? i ve always been logical , but i ve never considered myself to be unimaginative or dull .","298607":"i don t know how much responsibility facebook currently takes , so i don t really have an opinion on this question . i do know there was a lot of controversy regarding a recent shooting , though , because it was streamed on facebook live .","298608":"my wallet , my cigarettes , my phone , my phone charger , and my medication .","298609":"no . it s just a social media website .","298610":"my work has been based on the computer for as long as i ve been doing my job .","298611":"no , lmao . i have no desire to do that .","298612":"i ve never tried it on purpose before .","298613":"my supervisor occasionally checks in with me and tells me how i m doing , especially now in light of me administrating two programs well , technically one but i can t help but maintain the other too . she recently sent me an email saying that i ve proven myself to be a capable , detail oriented and talented writer editor and administrator , and she wrote that in my performance review .","298614":"lol . well , that s certainly something i ve also never heard of before . thank you for your observation .","298615":"i do most of the household chores in my household , including cleaning the house dusting , vacuuming , washing , scrubbing , etc etc , doing my family s laundry , helping with the cooking , taking out the garbage , picking up my mother s medication from the pharmacy , and occasionally grocery shopping . it isn t hard , it s just necessary . when something is necessary , you simply do it regardless of how easy or hard it is .","298616":"no , i ve never had a reason to monitor my screen time . i m not on my phone for the majority of the day until i get home from work .","298617":"i normally just check social media or watch youtube videos until i think i m ready to try going to sleep again . which probably isn t good , considering screen time before bed is generally unhealthy . but i know if i picked up a book to read , i would get engrossed in it and spend an additional x amount of hours reading instead of sleeping .","298618":"no , especially if you re considering learning a language as an adult . it s much easier for children to learn languages because their brains are more malleable , and it becomes increasingly more difficult to learn a new language as someone gets older .","298619":"this is something i ve never heard before .","298620":"my high school senior prank wasn t a prank at all , because my class was composed of a bunch of really stupid people who couldn t distinguished the difference between a joke and legit criminal activity . they ended up spray painting the building on the sides and on the roof and slashed the security guards tires .","298621":"i don t believe i have any enemies , unless i do and they haven t made themselves known to me . i ve had conflicts with people in the past , but that was years ago and i doubt there s any resentment lingering at this point .","298622":"my current profile picture is an old photo , actually . this was the color of my hair last year before i colored it purple , and then blue . i don t have any photos from the back or straight on , no .","298623":"yeah , i ended up getting two of them today one in the morning when i woke up to check my inbox , and another when i cleared my notifications on my lunch break . i don t know why it showed up twice . it s probably an april fools joke , but it s a stupid one at that . lol .","298624":"i don t have a beauty routine , lol . occasionally i ll apply witch hazel , but there isn t anything i do on a regular basis besides wash my face with warm water x per day .","298625":"i live in new york , and the furthest from new york i ve been has been to austin , texas .","298626":"i actually had a really nice day at work today ! ! i wasn t overwhelmed like i anticipated i was going to be , and i spent most of the day proofreading and adding details to biographies of clients who are appearing in one of our annual features to fit spatial restrictions . also , my supervisor put on the skyrim soundtrack over the work radio , so that was pleasant . my best friend just came home , and she s staying here until wednesday , so i might go out and see her tonight .","298627":"not so much lately as i used to in previous years , no . attending therapy for the past two years has taught me that dwelling in the past only leads to further discontent and frustration , especially considering the past cannot be changed . it s better to be mindful of the present moment while also acknowledging what the past has done to change you into the person you currently are .","298628":"not really , no . i don t have anything exciting planned for the summer , and i m not looking forward to the sweltering heat .","298629":"no . the artist and their artwork are one in the same . you cannot acknowledge one without the other .","298630":"somewhat , yes . i ve never ridden any big roller coasters because they seemed intimidating to me , and the few smaller ones i went on frightened me a little bit . however , i love water rides for some reason .","298631":"i ordered sushi for dinner tonight . i m going to eat it in about minutes .","298632":"no ? ? as long as you re drinking responsibly , there isn t anything wrong with drinking games .","298633":"yes , i absolutely love harry potter ! ! i was a fanatic back in the s and early s , i read every book as soon as they were published , and i went to a few midnight premieres of the movies .","298634":"no , that s definitely not justified . just because you got hurt in the past doesn t mean it s acceptable to hurt a completely different person in the same way you were hurt .","298635":"my weekend was busy , but fulfilling . saturday was spent cleaning out the basement , bringing up old furniture to throw out , and moving the old fridge into the garage to sell . then on sunday , i cleaned out most of the spare room upstairs and did loads of laundry .","298636":"probably europe ! ! i ve always wanted to visit the uk and spain .","298637":"this is a really insensitive question to ask someone , just fyi .","298638":"yeah , this past week it s been in the s fahrenheit .","298639":"i need a distraction from something i m not willing to discuss on askfm .","298640":"anyone have any questions ? ? i need a distraction .","298641":"i don t know anyone named alex .","298642":"i think you mean sex . regardless , i notice their height , hair , and smile .","298643":"self compassion .","298644":"no . lmao . you re anonymous either way , and like i said , i m not interested in making new friends . i m content with the friends i currently have .","298645":"i m not interested in making new friends .","298646":"hello do you have a question ? ?","298647":"i m not really celebrating it , i m just raising awareness of it on social media by posting about it .","298648":"? happy trans day of visibility , everyone ! ! ?","298649":"i don t have a new phone . i have the samsung galaxy s .","298650":"not really . i just do what i have to do , like laundry or cleaning or cooking or running errands . if i m feeling particularly bad that day , then those are challenges in themselves .","298651":"? ? ? a dog is an animal , not a gender . lmao .","298652":"this is inherently incorrect . gender identity isn t correlated with mental illness , and non binary simply means that an individual does not adhere to either of the gender binaries .","298653":"you re anonymous and i m not interested in making new friends .","298654":"if you read my bio , you would see that i m non binary . however , just because i posted a picture with underarm hair years ago doesn t mean that i never shave it , lol . i shave when i feel like shaving because no one is under any obligation to shave . it should be a personal choice .","298655":"i don t even know who that is .","298656":"i like body hair in general , but what i find attractive ultimately depends on the individual .","298657":"i ve never researched into it , so i m not entirely sure .","298658":"i don t use either .","298659":"hello my name is leigh . do you have a question ? ?","298660":"yeah , i agree . i normally don t either , especially if they just randomly post their opinion in my inbox without something prompting it first . i normally just delete them . people aren t willing to have civil discussions about different perspectives , especially if they re convinced that they re right and everyone else is wrong .","298661":"lol . i don t even know why i bothered explaining when i already knew they were gonna be like lol you re wrong . oh well .","298662":"my day has been rather slow . i woke up around am and have been lazy around the house ever since . i m supposed to be cleaning one of the rooms of the house since it s basically a storage area right now , but i haven t felt motivated . i don t have an easter break .","298663":"yeah it s extremely slow . i only get a question every few days .","298664":"i have an account on tellonym the link is in my bio . it s essentially the same thing as askfm , except the only option is to be anonymous . you also can t reply to people s answers , you can only send new questions or statements .","298665":"lol i saw that coming from a mile away . you already said you were going to oppose my views .","298666":"racism is a form of oppression that s based upon historical evidence . it s geared toward people of color in general , and white people cannot be oppressed because they ve always been in a position of power . that s why white people don t experience racism . it s systemic oppression . however , white people do face individual instances of discrimination based on their race . discrimination isn t rooted in oppression . it s simply a mindset .","298667":"thank you ! !","298668":"i ve considered it , yes . if i get ever tired of the long hair , i might have to buzz it so that the two sides are even again .","298669":"if you re intent on proving me wrong before i even state the reasons , then there s no use trying to explain them to you . you re going to reject what i have to say anyway , so it would be a waste of my time to tell you .","298670":"no , people who are white don t experience racism . they experience discrimination .","298671":"pajamas .","298672":"no , i wasn t aware of that fact . if it s actually true , i don t care enough to research it either .","298673":"i honestly have no clue . it isn t something i ve ever thought about before .","298674":"i ve always enjoyed their music , and they used to be a guilty pleasure of mine , haha . also if you haven t heard it before , their song house of gold is probably my favorite .","298675":"thank you ! ! idk if you like top or not , but their song chlorine is pretty good .","298676":"lol . i can kinda see where you re coming from with that .","298677":"everyone has a different perception of love what a relationship should entail . likewise , marriage is not a necessity and people should not feel obligated to get married . these days , people are more likely to experiment and push off marriage until they re absolutely certain they want to marry their partner , and a lot of people are also emphasizing their careers instead of relationships , marriage , or starting a family .","298678":"no . i don t talk to people privately either .","298679":"i don t discuss that on askfm .","298680":"strangers talking to me randomly is creepy to me . when people get too close when they re talking to you , or even just in general . certain questions people ask or statements they ve made can be creepy . i also usually get vibes off of people at times which makes me wary of them .","298681":"ideally , friends should be loyal to your friendship , not sugarcoat the truth to you , and push you to be the best version of yourself you can be . i only have a handful of friends , but i prefer it that way . i would rather have a few close friends than a lot of acquaintances . i normally discontinue friendships if they re toxic to my well being or they irritate me more than they bring me joy .","298682":"no . i don t give my snapchat out publicly .","298683":"weak by ajr https www . youtube . com watch ? v lcoiwtcaze","298684":"no , not at the moment . i don t know if exercising would help that at all , but hopefully it does .","298685":"did you stick to your goals ? is the only question i can think of . i have a lot of goals that i m working towards right now and i m determined to see them through .","298686":"i agree with this statement . most tests are standardized and don t take into account students various methods of learning . some students are just inept at taking exams , and their understanding of the material is more hands on than anything else . someone can be intelligent without being good at a conventional school because there are multiple forms of intelligence as well .","298687":"i m emotionally strong , but that s because i spent the majority of my life living in not so ideal situations and i was forced to become accustomed to dealing with emotional pain . because of that , i can handle emotional pain far better than physical pain . that being said , i m extremely sensitive on a physical scale and i cannot handle much physical pain at all . sometimes my boyfriend holds me too tightly and it ends up hurting me for hours afterwards obviously that wasn t his intention . my body is just very sensitive to pain for some reason .","298688":"i would take my boyfriend with me in a heartbeat . we deserve some time away from the hustle and struggle of living on this earth , lol .","298689":"if i was allowed a third option , i would choose not to go through either door . it s useless to live in the past because you cannot change what has happened to you , and the most you can do is learn from your experiences and utilize them to make your present moments and future brighter . at the same time , however , living in the future takes away from the present moment because the future could change at any point . the future isn t guaranteed either . i would rather stay where i am now , because i ve come to terms with my past and i ll deal with the future as it comes to me .","298690":"i don t think there s any movie i can quote word for word at the moment , sadly . i don t watch movies very often at all . although when i was much younger , i used to be able to quote harry potter the sorcerer s stone word for word because i had seen it so often .","298691":"i m definitely more right brain i m much more creative artistic than analytical , and i always enjoyed the arts more than the sciences . i have a natural ability for writing and painting , and while i also used to understand mathematics and other technical concepts well , the arts just came easily to me .","298692":"my family sorta celebrates mother s day , in the aspect that we usually purchase flowers for my mother and have a special dinner that night . we don t do anything too extravagant , though .","298693":"yeah , on quite a few occasions .","298694":"not really , no . i simply haven t done anything that warrants being an inspiration to other people . i ve struggled in the past , but i haven t exactly risen above those challenges and i still very much struggle on a regular basis with various things .","298695":"no , i can t say that i do . i m not ashamed of anything that brings me pleasure .","298696":"i ve met people who had narcissistic traits , but they were never diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder .","298697":"no , lol . taking care of a dog is a responsibility , and you re very much in a way acting as their parent . the responsibilities aren t the same when it comes to children versus dogs , obviously , but i don t think it s insulting to mothers when people call themselves dog moms or dog parents .","298698":"my boyfriend telling me that he was proud of me last night .","298699":"unfortunately , no . the stuff i was moving around and cleaning were just things in the house that needed to get done there was a lot of old furniture in the basement that needed to be broken up and put out on the curb for garbage , among other things .","298700":"aw , thank you ! !","298701":"i don t think anyone is that type of person . people should make their own conclusions , not blindly follow the opinions of others .","298702":"there s no guaranteed way . just be yourself the right person will come along eventually . if someone doesn t like you for who you are , then they re not worth pursuing anyway .","298703":"i feel productive af , but i m still so bored . i literally spent the entire morning moving furniture cabinets from the basement out to the garage and cleaning the entire living room and master bedroom , and i m also on my third load of laundry for the day . despite all of this , i m bored as hell . i m still planning on going through boxes that are piled up in a different room and showering tonight too , lmao . someone ask me questions","298704":"it ultimately depends on who i m around , lol . if i m around people i don t know very well , then i hold in my temper quite well . you would never even know i m angry . however , if i m close with you , then you can clearly see my temper written all over my face and i also have no issue with venting about what s angering me .","298705":"i don t have an evil inner voice , but i do have a portion of me that s extremely self deprecating , toxic , and hurtful . regardless of how much mental health treatment i ve gone through , i think that side of myself will always somewhat exist it s just a matter of how i combat those thoughts and rise above my impulses . lately i haven t been dealing with them well at all , but i m trying to build myself from the ground up with the support of my boyfriend and therapist .","298706":"no , i don t believe in heaven or hell .","298707":"my best friend doesn t use askfm . but i tell her frequently how much i value our friendship , and she s well aware of how much she has aided my life and has been a source of comfort during times of crisis . she s been there for me through everything .","298708":"i don t think it s inherently right to make assumptions about a person s self esteem solely because they choose not to post photos of themselves on askfm . their unwillingness to post photos could mean a plethora of things , whether that s because they are self conscious , or because they simply want to maintain their own privacy . it doesn t make me suspicious of anyone , no . fake accounts are pretty easy to discover because usually they do post photos , except it s obviously not of themselves . that s a lot different than finding a person on askfm who simply is uncomfortable posting a selfie .","298709":"i don t believe so , no . it s a lot more common these days to see people splitting with their partner in pursuit of someone who suits them better , rather than couples who stay together even though they re unhappy . in general , there s a lot more conversation regarding what s a healthy versus unhealthy relationship , which i think is really good .","298710":"depends on my mood tbh ! ! it ranges from alternative rock to hip hop to lo fi chillhop , as well as classical music i . e . video game soundtracks .","298711":"i didn t shave my head when i was , haha . the first time i shaved my head , i was in my mid s . prior to that , i always had either long hair or a pixie cut .","298712":"i own red lipstick , yes .","298713":"i don t believe brave is the right word , haha . more like indecisive and impulsive . however , i ve been cutting coloring my hair since i was basically years old , so it doesn t phase me anymore . it s just hair and it grows back .","298714":"i m honestly not sure it probably stems back to my childhood has psychological connotations to it somewhere , and it s stuck with me through adulthood .","298715":"no , it was something i wanted done for a really long time . my initial intention was to shave the entire half of my head , but i started out with a small undercut just to ease into the idea . . . . then a few months later , i shaved the entire side of my head on impulse . lmao .","298716":"if it s cold outside or raining , then yeah .","298717":"i ve always enjoyed the autumn winter months more than the spring summer months , so i don t think i would want to hibernate for the winter . that s essentially me sleeping through my favorite seasons , haha . although i have to admit the weather today has been absolutely beautiful . it s the warmest it s been so far in around degrees fahrenheit , and it feels wonderful to go outside without a coat on .","298718":"i actually had orange hair at one point when i was in high school , lol . i unfortunately don t have the photos , though . that was probably years ago .","298719":"thank you ! ! i usually ask for a or a , depending on when i think i might get another shave . i like having a small bit of stubble there .","298720":"thank you , friend ! ! it s one of my favorites besides the purple pink . i might try emerald green next .","298721":"aw , thank you","298722":"it s blue . you can see it in my other photos .","298723":"if you re talking about my current profile picture , then it s an old photograph . lol . however , my hair is the same style now as it was back then , just longer a different color . thank you","298724":"i think they saw that i liked your response to them this morning , which is probably how they found me . regardless , i think it s hilarious . i haven t heard comments like these since i was years old .","298725":"i would say this was another poor attempt at an insult , but considering this is somewhat in basic english , i ll nevertheless applaud you on your effort . your grammar is , at the very least , better in this message compared to previous messages . however , i should point out that you don t need the a in front of very , and you misspelled pupils . kudos on using the right form of you re , though ! ! many people find that one tricky .","298726":"this literally makes zero sense . if you re attempting to insult dera or myself , you re doing a pretty poor job at it . i will provide you with one more attempt .","298727":"the clocks went forward a few weeks ago . regardless , i prefer the winter weather over summer weather .","298728":"we don t really have many friends , but we have our respective friends whom we ve both met and have become friends with as well , if that makes sense . his friends are also my friends and vice versa . i don t think there s anyone that he s friends with who i dislike , though . he only has a handful of people he considers a friend .","298729":"yes , i m in love with my boyfriend .","298730":"breaking news a stranger on the internet has different tastes than another stranger on the internet . fascinating .","298731":"absolutely obsessed with my new theme .","298732":"in most cases , no . there s no reason why you can t talk to your partner and let them know why you re unhappy , and either try to fix the relationship or break up . the only exception that i can think of would be if someone was in an abvsive relationship and started dating someone else in an attempt to escape from that situation .","298733":"no , i haven t tried yoga in years .","298734":"every relationship has boundaries that shouldn t be crossed , and it varies from couple to couple . everyone should ideally be able to do what they want within reason as long as it doesn t hurt the relationship or their partner . what s hurtful to others varies wildly , so it goes on an individualized basis .","298735":"it s been quite a few years since i ve actually gone to a store to exchange something , lol . i don t really go clothes shopping , and when i do it s online , so it s more of a matter of returning it to the retailer and getting a credit back as opposed to going to a physical store for an exchange . however , i ve been pretty lucky recently with the clothing i ve purchased . i just bought two pairs of jeans off of amazon , and they re so comfortable and fit beautifully .","298736":"i try to purchase items on sale all the time , but sometimes the items i need aren t on sale that week , or they re sold out so i have to resort to an alternative . in those cases , i ll pay full price for the item because it s absolutely necessary .","298737":"i think the past may be difficult to forgive because there isn t anything we can do to change it . we may wish that things were different , but nevertheless , the past is concrete and the most we can do is accept the past and move on in spite of it . some people have problems forgiving their past because they still feel regret over what they said or did .","298738":"i don t believe in god because there isn t any scientific evidence to prove that god actually exists . all religions are based upon a matter of faith having faith that something or someone exists , regardless of the lack of or abundance of evidence that says otherwise . i ve never believed in god , even as a child from what i can remember . i was raised in a religious household and attended religion classes , but after i was confirmed , i basically told my parents i didn t believe in god and wanted nothing to do with the church anymore .","298739":"i don t believe in the afterlife , no .","298740":"my friday was stressful , but overall good . i went through the last little bit of training that i had to do with the former administrator of the magazine program she left on maternity leave yesterday , so they elected me to take over the program . then after work , i ran some errands and came home and had a large cup of iced coffee . the rest of the evening wasn t too terrible i mainly relaxed , watched television , and caught up on some of the questions in my inbox . i went to bed around pm or so .","298741":"i took this photo with my dslr a few years ago . it s probably one of my favorite photos to date .","298742":"i haven t made any appointments , so no . i want my arms to heal from skin picking completely before i make any more appointments .","298743":"i don t know anything about him other than the fact that he has a makeup line . i own like two or three of his lipsticks .","298744":"my boyfriend . we talked about a variety of different , serious topics when i saw him on wednesday night .","298745":"life is much more multifaceted than money power . people can have all the money or power in the world , but if they don t have meaningful relationships , then their life could be quite empty .","298746":"linkin park the entire hybrid theory album . stone temple pilots the entire no . album . korn the entire issues album . matt maeson beggar s song , tribulations , and cringe . hozier almost sweet music and angel of small death the codeine scene . grandson bury me face down , thoughts prayers , and best friends .","298747":"only if they were nick valentine .","298748":"no , that s why i referred to her as an online friend .","298749":"no , i can t say that i have any quirks that would be detrimental to a relationship . in any case , those wouldn t be quirks , they would be red flags . i m in a relationship , either way . so if anyone is considering dating me , they re better off finding someone else .","298750":"yes , i m more of a listener than a talker .","298751":"i m honestly not sure , lol . she doesn t post where on social media either way , so even if i knew , i wouldn t advertise that .","298752":"you can t change people s points of view , unfortunately . the most you can do is sit them down and point out that their way of thinking is inherently wrong and hurtful , and it s ultimately up to them to take that into consideration and do critical thinking about their own thoughts and feelings . a lot of racism is rooted in family values , so when someone grows up in a racist home , they will likely grow up to be racist just like their family . it takes effort and freedom of thought for these people to understand that the way they were raised was wrong .","298753":"my friends aren t racist , no . if they were racist , then i wouldn t be friends with them . someone who is racist judges people negatively based on the fact that they re black , spanish , asian , native american , etc etc . they fall into false stereotypes and treat people of different races as inferior to them .","298754":"yeah , but obviously it goes on a case by case basis . some people are capable of realizing their faults and can work towards bettering themselves and reversing negative or harmful thought patterns . other people , unfortunately , cannot or they re too proud to ever admit that their modality of thinking is wrong .","298755":"my profile picture is just a photograph of me drinking a beer , lol . there isn t a story behind it at all .","298756":"the last trip i took was out to the eastern end of long island . my boyfriend , his family , and i went out there to enjoy the breweries and the weather for a weekend . this happened quite a few months ago , though .","298757":"relaxing with the first cup of coffee in the morning . talking to my boyfriend at night before we go to sleep . getting new tattoos . going out for lunch or dinner with a close friend . writing something that brings me joy . taking a photograph that i m particularly proud of . playing video games with friends especially ultimate chicken horse or fibbage . positive reinforcement . forehead kisses from my boyfriend .","298758":"tomato mozzarella salad .","298759":"besides my promotion , i haven t really received any good news . everything else in my life has basically been a sh tshow , lmao .","298760":"one of my closest online friends lives there .","298761":"not really , no . i m not ashamed of anything that i enjoy .","298762":"i can already access the internet any time that i want , so that would be pretty meaningless to me . it s also nice to disconnect from the internet every once in a while .","298763":"the internet has resulted in some of my closest friendships , so i think that s the most important contribution it has made towards my life .","298764":"it s not the entire reason why i like that movie , but it does contribute to my positive feelings towards it .","298765":"i m not engaged , but my boyfriend and i have been together for nearly years .","298766":"my weekend only started an hour ago , lol . if you re talking about last weekend , though , then it was fine . i mainly cleaned , did laundry , and ran errands , though . i also worked in the mornings .","298767":"the relationships you make with other people , as well as finding something you re genuinely passionate about .","298768":"i played in an volleyball league through a catholic youth organization for one summer , lol . it would be hard to believe because i m an athiest , and generally i hate playing sports . however , it was actually a lot of fun considering everyone on my team was a friend of mine .","298769":"hello i m all right , although i could be better . it s been an extremely long day , so i m glad that i m finally in pajamas and relaxing with some netflix .","298770":"american psycho , spirited away , and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind .","298771":"the things that i want to rant about and recently did privately to a friend , haha are too personal to talk about on askfm . i keep my personal life fairly private , and i only really tell perhaps or people what s going on in my life . i also tend to push people away when i m under stress because i feel guilty talking about certain things , and that s also a habit i need to break .","298772":"nothing at all . i don t have an interest in owning a drone .","298773":"perhaps around a or , haha . i do what i need to get done throughout the day , and i would rather get all of my errands done at once instead of spanning them out over the course of a few days or a week . however , once i m home , there s basically nothing anyone can do to get me out of my pajamas , especially considering i need significant time at the end of each day to unwind .","298774":"busy , hectic , and stressful . that goes for both high school and college , actually . i was in advanced classes in high school , so i was constantly studying , as well as dealing with all of my personal issues that i was dealing with at the time . in addition , when i attended college , i also took on a full courseload while working hours per week , so i was always busy with writing papers , studying , or working ."}}
