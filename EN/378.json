to fully support themselves, both emotionally and financially. especially if you throw in future plans, like building a future together, buying a home, and starting a family. if he has the ability to go out and get a decent job and live independently, he should ideally do just that.\n  \n  at the same time, however, money isn't *everything* even though it is a large part of who we are and how we define ourselves. there would hypothetically be nothing wrong with you working and him staying home and making commission off of his artwork, for example, as long as you both can afford to live that way and provide fully for your family.\n  \n  overall, i think it's something you have to talk about with him more deeply. he's not going to be the \"next davinci\" or whatever, and he has to understand that people still need to make a living in order to survive in this life. whether that's by him supporting you while you work and doing everything he can to make you comfortable, or by both

if the person is making fun of themselves for their physical appearance, or if someone is the butt of the joke in a group of friends but they're not bothered by the comments whatsoever. in those

we've progressed so far in our relationship and have been dating for so many years, it would be so detrimental to our relationship if one of us became unfaithful (and did everything else that comes with being unfaithful, i.e. lying and whatnot). it would signify that one of us is obviously not as invested in the relationship as the other, and that sort of one-sided relationship is unfair and

*much* it can change a person. some people may be changed mildly, while others more intensely.\n  ","405700":"\n  i don't believe in good v. evil, so i don't really have an opinion on the matter. if someone is a terrible person, though, and has committed atrocities like mass m*rder or r*pe, i don't believe they should be shown any mercy whatsoever.\n  ","405701":"\n  yes, i believe there's truth in that statement. our first love sets a foundation for how we view love, whether we're conscious of it or not. we're either comparing our subsequent loves to that love or we sometimes even feel as if our first love was \"the one that got away.\"\n  ","405702":"\n  most of the time, no. however, my job has been doing a great job at affirming my worth and establishing credit in my name for all of the hard work i've been putting into my projects. it's a nice change from what i'm used to regarding jobs, as all of the jobs i've had in the past took advantage of their workers and never gave positive reinforcement.\n  ","405703":"\n  last sunday, actually. after my friend and i completed the real estate application, we went out to lunch together and ordered delicious food and drinks. i felt like i was truly relaxed and living in the moment because we had just completed a monumental step in the renting process, and we deserved to have a good time afterwards.\n  ","405704":"\n  my best friend and i met in 6th grade. we sat at the same lunch table and we bonded over our shared interest in music.\n  ","405705":"\n  love at first sight doesn't exist, meanwhile lust *does* exist. many people confuse lust for love at first sight, because they feel an instant attraction to someone.\n  ","405706":"\n  yeah, when i was younger i had an episode of rage and ended up ripping the door off of my closet and smashing it with my fists.\n  ","405707":"\n  no, i've surprisingly never broken a bone before.\n  ","405708":"\n  watching my boyfriend do something he loves doing and is

addiction\/dilemma at the moment. i do desperately need to cut down on smoking, not only for my own health but also because of how much money i'm laying out on cigarettes each week. i would save a lot of money by quitting smoking.\n  ","405712":"\n  my boyfriend and i went on a date to a restaurant a month or so ago. we hardly have the time to go on legitimate dates these days because our schedules conflict so much, so it was really nice to be able to go out and indulge on good food and drinks together.\n  ","405713":"\n  i don't believe you can make a general, blanket statement like that regarding an entire demographic of people because it's inaccurate. someone's worth or value isn't determined by their physical looks, either.\n  ","405714":"\n  pros ;\n  \n  -- there are always things to do, whether in town or on the beach. most places don't close until super late, especially during the summer. you're extremely close to both manhattan and wine country.\n  \n  cons ;\n  \n  -- everything is super expensive. the cost of living is too high for most people to deal with, and as a result, most people end up moving to other states.\n  ","405715":"\n  my forensics teacher during high school had the most substantial impact on me. he was the most \"real\" teacher i had during those years, and he confessed his shady past and ability to persevere and overcome his personal demons in order to get to where he is today. i've always had a lot of respect for him, and i even contacted him later while i was in college when i had a personal problem that i couldn't solve on my own.\n  ","405716":"\n  yes, i love scary stories but they do make me super paranoid, lol. i have to be around people while hearing a scary story, especially if they're rumored to be true events.\n

entailed (i have to have my photo taken and write an editor's letter for the publication i'm in charge of). she got *so* happy for me and reaffirmed my value, and it made me smile knowing that someone believes in me like that.\n  ","405722":"\n  no, cheating is almost never justified unless someone is in a dangerous or ab*sive situation, and the only way for them to escape their partner is by being intimate with someone else (it normally goes much deeper than that, though).\n  \n  if your partner has a low libido and you're not satisfied with them on a s*xual level, then you need to talk to them one-on-one about how to treat the problem or overcome it in different ways. if it's something that you two cannot agree on, then the best thing to do is break up. cheating plays no role in this situation.\n  ","405723":"\n  uh, honestly -- politicians. politicians and other governmental officials have the ability to either make or break our society.\n  ","405724":"\n  let's not go there,

stereotype regarding men and their \"preference\" for shorter women. shorter women are generally seen as cute, quaint, and petite. taller women, on the other hand, are seen as \"intimidating\" for some reason.\n  ","405726":"\n  i've owned more converse shoes than vans shoes, so i suppose i'll choose converse. i haven't worn either of them in years, though.\n  ","405727":"\n  in the next 2.5

health; and furthering my relationship with my boyfriend.\n  ","405728":"\n  my boyfriend laughing or smiling; having a fresh cup of coffee in the morning while sitting outside on the patio; and waking up to freshly fallen snow on the ground.\n  ","405729":"\n  i don't remember the exact number, but it's in the 115-120 range (at least it was when i was a child). it's probably lower now, haha.\n  ","405730":"\n  my coworker referred to her boobs as \"chickee tee-tas\" out of nowhere today & i burst out laughing.\n  ","405731":"\n  i would be looking forward to a work-related cocktail party i'm going to this saturday, but i'm feeling pretty ambivalent towards it now. i *should* go given my new position, but i really don't want to go.\n  ","405732":"\n  ???\n  ","405733":"\n  my first job was a cashier at a drug store when i was 19 years old.\n  ","405734":"\n  i'm all right. i'm exhausted for some reason, though. i slept for ten hours last night and it still doesn't feel like enough.\n  ","405735":"\n  LOL, no. i have no reason to talk or sing.\n  ","405736":"\n  yeah, i believe so. sometimes when a person is too nice they accidentally allow other people to walk all over them.\n  ","405737":"\n  i prefer to use dark mode. it's easier on my eyes.\n  ","405738":"\n  i've never even heard of that term before.\n  ","405739":"\n  nowhere did i indicate that judging something was a good or bad thing. i simply answered the question.\n  ","405740":"\n  when you're judging something, you're essentially applying your opinion to that person, place, thing, etc etc.\n

rum-soaked cannoli cake.\n  ","405743":"\n  no, generally people who have big egos have little to no power in their actual lives. there would be no reason to feel intimidated by them.\n  ","405744":"\n  aw, thank you. :'))\n  ","405745":"\n  when you have a big ego, it means you have an inflated sense of self importance and have little regard for those around you -- primarily because you believe *your* feelings are much more important than those of others.\n  ","405746":"\n  i just got a promotion and a raise at work today. my friend and i also just submitted an application to rent a house.\n  ","405747":"\n  that's one facet of being trans, yeah. that's called body dysphoria. not every trans person experiences it, though. there are some people who are non-binary or genderfluid, for example, who are comfortable or have come to terms with their bodies.\n  ","405748":"\n  never, lol. whenever i send out questions, they're not anonymous.\n  ","405749":"\n  yes, i

","405754":"\n  verbally, no. i'm good at expressing my feelings via written word but definitely not through speaking. however, i'm lucky in that i have a therapist who understands me when i do try to talk about my feelings and makes them coherent enough so we can talk about them.\n  ","405755":"\n  i haven't asked questions in quite a long time.\n  ","405756":"\n  this isn't something i can give a general answer to because it ultimately depends on the relationship. for example, some people may find it better to move on entirely while others may benefit from waiting for their partner (well, ex).\n  \n  it's something you have to sit down with your partner and discuss beforehand so that you're both on the same page.\n  ","405757":"\n  i love bbq's, haha. it's relaxing to sit outside, grill some food, and have a few drinks with close friends or family.\n  ","405758":"\n  no, i'm not asexual. i just have a low or inexistent libido.\n  ","405759":"\n  i don't believe i'm latvian.\n

","405765":"\n  no need to be sorry, that wasn't what i was implying by any means. a \"lack of\" something simply means they don't have something, it's just my verbiage.\n  \n  especially coming from

music, writing, and sleeping.\n  ","405768":"\n  lol, i normally just jump into whatever it is i want to say instead of saying \"hi.\" however, i really only do that with my close friends since i know they won't be bothered by me doing that.\n  ","405769":"\n  no, i've never really watched anime outside of studio ghibli films.\n  ","405770":"\n  it doesn't bother or excite me either way. if they

earthy colors, i.e. mahogany, forest green, navy blue, dark purple, gray, and black.\n  ","405774":"\n  the only thing that bothers me about my boyfriend is the fact that he's a bit messy. he'll get home from work, throw his clothes off onto the floor, eat and leave the plate on the table, etc etc. he does a wonderful cleaning job when he *does* clean, but it isn't done as often as i would personally like.\n  ","405775":"\n  i'm absolutely terrible at public speaking because of my anxiety disorder. it always sends me into a bad panic.\n  ","405776":"\n  no. i don't care about wrinkles at all. i already have a few, and they don't bother me. it's just a natural part of getting older.\n  ","405777":"\n  i don't believe you need dysphoria to be trans, no. most people who *are* trans do have dysphoria, though, for various reasons that are personal to them. you definitely do not need to have surgery in order to be valid as trans, either.\n  \n  personally speaking, i have moderate dysphoria, especially when it comes to my chest. when i lose more weight and have less of a tummy, i want to buy another binder that fits me better. the one i have now is way too small.\n  ","405778":"\n  i've never had them before.\n  ","405779":"\n  hate is a very strong word -- if someone *hates* children, then i would assume that they feel quite strongly about the mere presence of children, regardless of who that child is. i think it's fairly unreasonable because you haven't gotten to know that child at all and not every child is the same.\n  \n  however, i do understand feeling weird about children because you don't know how to communicate or relate to them. that's very much the boat i'm always in.\n  ","405780":"\n  LOL, yes. i have a tendency to ramble at times, or to thoroughly explain myself when it isn't necessary.\n  ","405781":"\n  ???\n  \n  whoever told you that is completely wrong, lol. your preferred hairstyle has no correlation with your life experiences.\n  ","405782":"\n  everything is expensive on long island, lmaoo. buying property is extremely expensive, a regular house averages around $500,000.\n  ","405783":"\n  i think it's been a

becoming difficult.\n  ","405784":"\n  his father's new girlfriend and two daughters moved into the house. there simply wasn't enough room for me.\n  ","405785":"\n  twice, i believe. i had one television that lasted me quite a few years beginning when i was a sophomore in college. that television eventually broke (the back light was broken and it wouldn't have been worth it to fix it), so i purchased a new television a few years ago.\n  ","405786":"\n  i believe my family had the fox channel when i was growing up. i don't watch cable television, though. i haven't turned my cable box on in over a year.\n  ","405787":"\n  i've always been indecisive on this issue because i've heard viewpoints from both perspectives and see valid points from each. however, i think i more agree with the viewpoint that aromantic\/asexual people aren't necessarily part of the lgbtq+ community.\n  \n  being aromantic\/asexual means you simply do not feel attraction toward other people, whether romantically or sexually. it wouldn't really fall on the lgbtq+ scale because it's a lack of attraction, not an attraction that differs from the \"norm.\" however, i do also believe that there is discrimination and misunderstanding of people who are aromantic\/asexual because it's something that hasn't been studied or discussed often.\n  ","405788":"\n  according to past studies, finland is

plan happening rather than days or weeks.\n  \n  sometimes i don't know if i'm up to doing something until the day it's happening, which is why i'm so spontaneous with making plans with friends. i'll usually ask people if they're available the same day or night, and if they are, then we'll plan something then. if not, it isn't a big deal to me.\n  ","405796":"\n  one should *never* stop learning. there's an infinite amount of knowledge out there in the world, and even if you think you know a lot about a subject, there is always more to learn. education is not limited to the classroom, and we always have the opportunity to educate ourselves on new topics or ideas.\n  ","405797":"\n  yes, i have. i've been jealous of friends for reaching more milestones in their lives prior to me reaching the same milestones. things like graduating from college on time, attending graduate school, getting engaged or married, buying a house, having children, getting promotions at work, etc etc.\n  \n  eventually, i realized that jealousy is a useless and harmful emotion and that everyone goes through life at their own pace. instead of feeling jealous of my friends, i taught myself to be genuinely happy for them because of their achievements. just because they achieved something doesn't mean that my achievements thus far are worthless.\n  ","405798":"\n  yes, i have. when i was a teenager, i was messing around with a ouija board with a friend. we had it answer questions about the house we were in, and we later confirmed the answers with my friend's parents. during our session with the

traveling is other people who may make the experience terrible, haha. i also hate how much it costs to travel these days -- even going to upstate new york, it accrued a lot of money just in fees and

It's been going on for a while & it's only draining me & making things worse. I told him we may end up together again, we may not.

To which he replied he has a gf at home (we don't even live together) and she said oh she won't mind. And he goes yes she will, I love her & things aren't well rn but I'm only for her. And the girl says omg I wish I had a man like you you're an angel, see you around. The story sounds like bs to me.. What do you think? I feel like he made it up in another attempt to manipulate me into jumping back into his arms again in awe, even though he said it apparently happens everytime he goes out jogging & he's shared a story with me like that before. So yeah, I was angry & jealous so but I'm also questioning the validity of the story so it backfired on him. Now I just wanna cut him off tbh. I'm just annoyed with him but I'm worried I might miss him down the line. What do you think I should do? Thx sorry this was so long! Appreciate it\n  \n  --\n  \n  no worries about the story being long !! it helps me understand things more clearly. i just want to preface this by saying i don't know your boyfriend, so i don't know his personality or if he's the type of person to fabricate stories like that. however, upon reading this for the first time, it *did* sound to me like he made that jogging story up to sorta \"prove\" to you that he's a good, loyal boyfriend. i can't exactly imagine a woman randomly stopping her run to tell a stranger that he's attractive. most people i know take their exercising seriously and don't want anything to do with other people when they're jogging in public.\n  \n  however, i understand you feeling annoyed by this because i would most definitely feel the same way if i was in your circumstance. depending on how close you two currently are, would it be appropriate you think for you to \"call him out\" on his behavior? basically saying, \"did you make up that story in an attempt to prove your loyalty and win me back?\" depending on the person, it may not be a good idea but it's just ... something to think about.\n  \n  either way, there needs to be communication between you two. i know you said that you told him that you two might not get back together, which is good, but it doesn't seem like he really understands that. if you haven't tried already, perhaps try talking to him about these things again and if he tries pulling the same sh*t then maybe think about leaving. nobody should try to guilt you back into a relationship, that's wrong and manipulative.\n

favorite). if anything, i've been drinking spiked seltzer.\n  ","406271":"\n  that's my worst nightmare. lmaoo.\n  ","406272":"\n  definitely not. i appreciate the sentiment, though.\n  ","406273":"\n  i believe that everyone ultimately has their own definition of what bisexual entails, solely due to the \"controversy\" revolving around the difference between bi and pan. it depends on what a person is really most comfortable identifying as, in my opinion.\n  \n  i believe personally that bisexual means you like two of more genders, but not all (whereas, pan means all genders). i personally identify as bi because i don't believe i'm attracted to all genders, and it feels most comfortable to me. i'm also of a somewhat older generation as well, though.\n  ","406274":"\n  my good friend texted me a link to an apartment available for rent, and it meets all of our criteria of what we're looking for. he just put in an application for the apartment and included my email address as a reference, since i'll be moving in with him, so hopefully we hear back !!\n  \n  it isn't terrible at all, and it's within an amount i believe i can afford on a monthly basis. we just don't know if utilities are included in the price, so we're going to have to find that out before ultimately making a decision.\n  ","406275":"\n  exercising is perhaps the only way i push my body's limits, haha. i've been trying to push myself harder on the treadmill every week or so, which has been increasing my stamina greatly. the only thing i dislike is that it makes me feel so sore the following day.\n

i was home by like 9:30pm.\n  ","406278":"\n  i don't have an opinion on him. i don't know anything about him.\n  ","406279":"\n  considering i'm part of the lgbtq+ community, i'm 100 percent in support of gay relationships and marriage. there's no reason why a person should not be allowed to date or marry someone who's the same sex or gender as them -- thinking that being gay is \"wrong\" is an archaic form of thinking that has no place in 2019.\n  ","406280":"\n  my healthy daily habits include taking my medication, drinking water, and going to bed at a reasonable time (normally getting

abortion is all about the right to choose what occurs within someone's own body (bodily autonomy). veganism, on the other hand, is a lifestyle choice revolving around the desire to help the planet and animals by not consuming or using products that are animal-derived.\n  ","406283":"\n  i normally vent to my friends and\/or boyfriend about what's upsetting me, just so i can get their opinion and they can comfort me or rationalize my feelings. sometimes they validate what i'm feeling so that i feel less alone with my thoughts.\n  \n  i also have a few unhealthy coping mechanisms, but talking to people is perhaps my healthiest.\n  ","406284":"\n  that honestly sounds extremely unhealthy. using pain as a coping mechanism isn't good and can lead to further unhealthy coping mechanisms in the long run as well. it could possibly develop into self-injurious behavior because after a while, the initial pain won't be enough and the person will crave more.\n  ","406285":"\n  i'm doing fine, just

for an answer after the first time the woman says \"no,\" then i would consider that to be harassing. it's disgusting how some people won't accept no for an answer and think that by \"trying harder\" they can somehow win a person over. if someone says no to you the first time, then accept it for what it is and move on.\n  ","406294":"\n  depends on the type of tea. white and green tea, i take it

hugged her last night before i left her party.\n  ","406303":"\n  honestly, i'm at the point in my life where i just want to stay home, sleep, and relax. i would call out of work (with no

i.e. mahogany, dark blue, dark purple, forest green, black, and gray.\n  ","406306":"\n  i keep my appearance *very* low-key, lmaoo. i have nobody that i wish to impress, and i would rather be comfortable in what i'm wearing.\n  ","406307":"\n  either \"how old are you?\" or \"what is your job?\"\n  \n  both questions can easily be answered by looking at my bio, which people rarely do it

much about them, but i personally think the american health care system is flawed. a lot of people cannot afford to see doctors or buy medication, especially if they're of a low class status, which only exacerbates their conditions and puts them in greater debt when something terrible happens to their health. it's a backwards system.\n  \n  that's assuming insurance covers things, as well. insurance can choose not to cover something if they don't feel it's necessary, and most of the time they only cover a quarter of the actual cost.\n  ","406338":"\n  someone's ethnicity doesn't mean anything to me, as long as we have common interests, goals, and there isn't a culture clash. i wouldn't have any qualms with dating someone of a different ethnicity (i mean, my boyfriend is spanish

on askfm.\n  ","406344":"\n  i loved my first girlfriend, despite the fact that we were young, and i was heartbroken when we broke up. it took me a while to get over her, and we didn't speak for two to three years. eventually, i became interested in other people and that helped me overcome those feelings because it taught me that she wasn't the only person for me in my life.\n  ","406345":"\n  my day is going pretty well !! i woke up around 8:00am and made myself a cup of coffee, and i've been scrolling through social media and doing laundry every since.\n  \n  i have a birthday party to

year it's been getting worse steadily in terms of snowstorms.\n  \n  here's a photo of a snowstorm we had two years ago, haha it wasn't terrible but it was a pain in the ass.\n  ","406348":"\n  i feel much better than i did yesterday, thank you. \u2661 i vented to my coworker as well as my boyfriend, and they helped rationalize and validate my feelings.\n  ","406349":"\n  i respectfully disagree. sometimes our judgments are mild or happen unconsciously. it's innate, and as long as you're not discriminating against people, then there's nothing wrong with it.\n  ","406350":"\n  everyone judges others to some degree, i believe. it just depends on whether or not you allow your judgments to overrule your thinking.\n  ","406351":"\n  yeah, i have in the past !! these days, i keep it at a 1 or

i've had half my head shaved for over a year at this point. i don't remember exactly when i started doing the undercut on the opposite side, but it's been quite a few years now.\n  ","406354":"\n  honestly, i don't remember. lmaoo. i suppose it was within the first year, though. i was infatuated with him from the very beginning, but after enduring significant hardship together, we became much closer and i realized i was in love with him.\n  ","406355":"\n  i never really thought of it as a matter of bravery. it's just something i enjoy doing because i always hated having regular, brown-colored hair. i've been coloring my hair since i was 12 years old.\n  ","406356":"\n  i think that's a bit peculiar, yeah. that man is essentially an established adult with a career, and they're dating a woman who hasn't even graduated from college yet. i find that very uncomfortable.\n  ","406357":"\n  depends on how old they are and how young the women they're dating are. if they're a child, then obviously they're a predator.\n  ","406358":"\n  yes, i do !! her work is amazing, she's the one who also colored my hair pink, purple, and blue within the past year.\n  ","406359":"\n  i prefer wearing knee-high boots in the winter. i don't even own high heels because i can't walk in them and they're uncomfortable.\n  ","406360":"\n  perhaps because older men are likely more mature with their lives put more together. most women, from my understanding, aren't interested in younger men because they have a tendency to be immature and aren't ready to settle down.\n  ","406361":"\n  my original intention was orange, so it's all good. i'm in the process of growing my hair out, but keeping the sides shaved.\n  ","406362":"\n  thank you !! it's actually more orange at this point, the red has been washing out quickly.\n  ","406363":"\n  i was under the impression that it was always something that occurred, not just recently.\n  ","406364":"\n  my boyfriend and i once went on a date to a park on the north shore of long island. it's a long hiking trail that goes through various fields, woods, and eventually leads up to bluffs and a beautiful beach. we spent the day there, and it was absolutely gorgeous.\n  ","406365":"\n  i like books with darker themes, particularly revolving around crime, addiction, and death. my ideal book would be one that discusses the importance of mental health within its characters and deals with subject matters such as drug or alcohol addiction, mental illness, the importance of platonic and romantic relationships, underground crime rings, and vengeance.\n  ","406366":"\n  the first thing i would do is purchase a house for myself, my friends, and my boyfriend. afterwards, i would want to travel cross country and visit all of the national parks, particularly redwood national park. i also want to see the mountains and lakes of alaska because they look absolutely beautiful.\n  ","406367":"\n  i really enjoyed studying the history of world war ii when i was in high school & college. i find war history to be incredibly interesting.\n  ","406368":"\n  i don't go swimming and don't particularly like it, but if i had to choose between those options, i would likely choose a lake. the ocean is too chaotic for me, and i would be afraid to get pulled out to sea. i've never liked swimming pools and rivers aren't deep enough for me, lol.\n  ","406369":"\n  these days, i'm against the notion of seeking revenge. holding onto those kinds of negative emotions hurts you more than anyone else, and it's healthier to try to accept what happened, move on with your life, and try to make the best out of the bad situations.\n  \n  when i was younger, i was completely all for seeking revenge, but that was during a time when i had a lot of anger within me towards basically everyone and lashed out often. i didn't realize until later on that it was unhealthy for my mental health.\n  ","406370":"\n  when i was younger, even as a teenager, i was afraid of the dark. i always thought something was haunting me and would attack me in my sleep, and my imagination would go wild. i always needed some form of light in my bedroom at night.\n  \n  these days, i love sleeping in absolute darkness and the darkness doesn't frighten me anymore.\n  ","406371":"\n  -- publish a book.\n  \n  -- travel cross country to various national parks, particularly the redwoods.\n  \n  -- adopt a puppy.\n  ","406372":"\n  -- lately, i've learned that the only person you can genuinely rely on is yourself. if you need to do something, you have to do it yourself otherwise it will never get done, especially done the way you would like it to be done. most people are unreliable.\n  \n  -- since music is considered a form of art, i've been listening to a lot of video game soundtracks lately and came to the conclusion that my favorite video game soundtrack is from halo 2.\n  \n  -- i haven't really eaten any outstanding food lately

purchased a shirt off of amazon once, and it was coming from china. i was hesitant to buy it because i didn't know if it would be good quality or not. when i got the shirt in the mail, it was paper

ugh, that sounds aggravating. honestly though -- you can't take those kinds of opinions into consideration, especially since everyone has a different idea of what \"attractive\" is. if you think he's average-looking and not ugly, and you're also incredibly attracted to his personality, then *your* opinion is the only opinion that truly matters. everyone else in your life is going to have to simply accept that. ideally, they should have your happiness in mind.\n  ","406381":"\n  looks are somewhat important because that determines your *physical* chemistry with one another -- however, what it ultimately comes down to is the meshing of your personalities. if you're dating someone based solely on their appearance and you don't have mental chemistry between you, then the relationship is going to be shallow and short-lived.\n  \n  relationships work best when there's communication, understanding, the existence of similar interests or goals, and support\/encouragement. all of these things

","406385":"\n  personally speaking, no. i don't believe i would be able to be in a relationship with someone who isn't fully over their ex. when someone isn't over their ex and is dating someone new, they're likely going to compare their new relationship with their old one, instead of judging their current relationship as it is.\n  \n  it isn't fair to either person involved, and when you're still emotionally attached to an ex, you're not allowing yourself to put yourself fully into your new relationship. there's going to always be a part of you held back, questioning the validity of the relationship. it might not even be a healthy relationship after a while.\n  ","406386":"\n  walking the forest trails and seeing a group of trees leading down to the lake. this was taken in upstate

responses. i only follow people whose answers i genuinely enjoy (i only follow around 30 people), so everyone has unique answers to the occasional questions i send out.\n  ","406421":"\n  yeah, when i was younger i smoked pretty regularly. now i only smoke maybe once per month or so.\n  ","406422":"\n  i was in two relationships before dating my current partner.\n  ","406423":"\n  i normally lie about how i'm feeling so that no one worries or inquires about my health, like if i'm angry or not having a good mental health day. i'll just say that i'm fine and move on.\n  ","406424":"\n  i honestly have no clue. i was a child.\n  ","406425":"\n  around 8-9, most of the time. there are instances where i tell white lies, but overall, i see no reason to lie. it only hurts yourself in the long run.\n  ","406426":"\n  this is unfortunately true, although honestly i was under the assumption that it happened more with teenagers than adults.\n  ","406427":"\n  i agree. i'm used to it though, which i suppose is alarming in itself. i've gotten much worse questions than whether or not i was spanked as a child.\n  ","406428":"\n  i have no desire to talk about my private life with anyone other than my close friends, boyfriend, and therapist.\n  ","406429":"\n  honestly, the only type of people who would consider being naive to be cute are predators, because being naive makes a person vulnerable.\n  ","406430":"\n  my parents had ab*sive forms of \"discipline,\" and i'm not going to go any further than that.\n  ","406431":"\n  no, what's inappropriate to one person may be appropriate to someone else (which is what i said in my initial answer).\n  ","406432":"\n  nothing is 100 percent certain, so no. however, it's also unhealthy to focus on the future like that in terms of relationships as well. if you're with someone and all you can think about is that one day you'll eventually break up, you won't allow yourself room to enjoy the present day with that person.\n  ","406433":"\n  i don't know the nature of your relationship with him, but if there's an imbalance there (i.e. he still loves you but you don't return the feelings), going so far as to buy him a gift may give off the wrong impression. you don't want to do something that might suggest that you two are still an item, or give him false hope.\n  \n  however, you can care for someone while acknowledging that the relationship didn't work. you just have to be clear with him that you don't have any intention of dating him again, but you still wish him well.\n  ","406434":"\n  just because something is a question doesn't automatically mean it isn't inappropriate, lmaoo.\n  \n  questions can most definitely be inappropriate or intrusive. especially if someone is asking anonymously, it means that they're ashamed to show their face while asking that question since they wouldn't want people to know who they are otherwise. that's an indication that what they're asking is borderline inappropriate.\n  ","406435":"\n  no -- if that were to happen, it would have happened already. the few times a person would find someone who's \"better\" than their current partner would be if they're already unhappy in the relationship. if they were happy in the relationship, they simply wouldn't view other people in a dating context like that.\n  \n  you also have to keep in mind that relationships are built off of a foundation of trust. you have to trust that your partner won't run off with someone else, and if that's something you actively fear, it may be an indication that you don't trust your partner as much as you think you do.\n  ","406436":"\n  depends on who you're asking the questions to. some people are comfortable answering s*xual questions, while others aren't.\n  \n  i consider them to be inappropriate, personally speaking. i usually delete all forms of s*xual questions.\n  ","406437":"\n  when they're actively doing things to discriminate against other people, and they're well aware that their behavior is wrong but they simply don't care.\n  ","406438":"\n  i'm not a fan of either band.\n  ","406439":"\n  no, especially considering i'm in my mid-to-late 20s. at that point, it's simply ignorance.\n  ","406440":"\n  of course it's possible. there are some people in our lives that we may always have feelings for, regardless of how often we may see them. they may occupy a special place in our hearts in spite of the time that has passed.\n  ","406441":"\n  i don't have any specific location in mind. i would rather it happen naturally in a place we're both comfortable, or perhaps a place that's meaningful to us. i wouldn't want anyone else to be there, though. proposals are personal events between two people.\n  ","406442":"\n  no, most of the time my medication keeps me on a stable path, emotionally (granted i'm taking them everyday). if i'm feeling sad or borderline depressed, it's usually because of something circumstantial in my life.\n  ","406443":"\n  any of the dates i've gone on with my boyfriend where we visited a park or nature preserve.\n  ","406444":"\n  it's hard to tell in the photo, but it's fried eggs on a croissant with breakfast potatoes, lol.\n  ","406445":"\n  nobody has ever proposed to me before, lol.\n  ","406446":"\n  waking up in the morning, refreshed and ready to start the day. those mornings where you get enough sleep and feel invincible, like you can handle anything thrown at you that day.\n  ","406447":"\n  yeah, i'm also not subtle when i'm checking someone out so it becomes awkward sometimes, lmao.\n  ","406448":"\n  just by talking to someone without having the clear intention of becoming their friend. all of my friendships have happened with no ulterior motive behind them, we just began talking and it progressed from there.\n  \n  either way, i'm not looking to make new friends.\n  ","406449":"\n  ordered breakfast for my family this morning !! eating outside is so much lovelier than eating inside. ?\n  ","406450":"\n  i *almost* broke an ipad that my boyfriend purchased me quite a number of years ago, when i was still in college. i went to grab it out of his hands and i ended up smacking the ipad against the table, which somewhat shattered the glass screen. luckily it still worked, but there was a nasty crack in the screen.\n  ","406451":"\n  probably lady gaga, since apparently i look similar to her.\n  ","406452":"\n  LOL. yeah, and at that point the water is stale and gross, so i can definitely understand that.\n  \n  i used to do that a lot, but i've gotten much better at bringing back my empty or half-filled cups of water, simply because i hate clutter now.\n  ","406453":"\n  the more that i think about this question, the more that i realize that if i continue to wait, then nothing will get done. there are certain things in my life that i've been waiting on for the \"perfect moment,\" but in reality, we must do what's necessary regardless of the timing if we want to make any real progress. life doesn't wait for you, so we shouldn't wait for opportunities to present themselves. we must make those opportunities for ourselves.\n  ","406454":"\n  honestly, i can't envision myself reaching an old age.\n  \n  however, i also couldn't imagine myself reaching the age of 25, let alone live past it to see 27 (almost 28). life works in mysterious ways.\n  ","406455":"\n  i don't believe in the generic definition of soul mates, no. generally speaking, soul mates refer to two people who are romantically \"made\" for one another, their chemistry is unstoppable and there's nobody else in the world that meshes with you other than that person.\n  \n  i don't believe in that at all. i believe that there could be dozens of people who fit you, your needs, and are in the same stage of life as you are. in addition, soul mates don't necessarily have to be romantic partners -- they can be platonic friends, unwavering friendships that provide the utmost support and encouragement in your life.\n  ","406456":"\n  -- before i went to a local college my sophomore year, i attended a liberal arts college in massachusetts and majored in creative writing and fiction.\n  \n  -- my family used to have a german shepherd for around 10 years. we got her when i was a pre-teen and she passed away when i was in college. she was the most beautiful dog.\n  \n  -- i used to know how to play the guitar, ukulele, and keyboard when i was a teenager. my ultimate dream was to become a professional musician. my first tattoo when i turned 18 was a bass clef symbol turned into yin and yang symbols on each of my shoulder blades -- to represent the duality of music.\n  \n  -- when i was in high school, i was a prolific painter. i mainly painted in acrylics, but i also enjoyed oil painting and watercolor. i won awards for my art and my work was hung in a museum and at town hall.\n  ","406457":"\n  my first date with my boyfriend was to a restaurant, and then we saw a movie together. i normally wouldn't recommend seeing a movie as a first date because you can't talk and get to know the person you're dating, but the outing we had to the restaurant beforehand was incredible and we really got to talk. :'))\n  \n  on our second date, we went to the beach together. we found an area of the beach that used to be a dock for small boats, and it sorta became our \"spot.\" we layed on the beach and listened to music for the entire day, which is something that really drew our relationship closer because we're both so passionate about music.\n  ","406458":"\n  give up on my ultimate dream of being a published writer. even though i haven't written anything creatively in a few months, i still cannot envision myself completely giving up on those ambitions.\n  ","406459":"\n  ah, so many !! i would absolutely love to visit new zealand, though. it looks absolutely beautiful, and i really want to see the shire.\n  ","406460":"\n  \"girl interrupted\" by susanna kaysen.\n  \n  it was the first book that introduced me to mental health & mental illness, especially with respect to depression and borderline personality disorder. a lot of what kaysen wrote about resonated with me on an intimate level, and it was what first led me to question my own struggles with mental health. the book really opened my eyes to what i was dealing with and how what i was feeling wasn't \"normal\" or healthy.\n  ","406461":"\n  yes, love is one of the few things that i *do* believe in. love, whether it was among me and friends or me and my boyfriend, has inspired and motivated me to keep pushing forward even when i felt that there were too many obstacles stacked against me.\n  \n  because of my unwavering belief and faith in love, i actually have the phrase \"amor vincit omnia\" tattooed on my arm. it's latin for \"love conquers all.\"\n  ","406462":"\n  i believe the most pressing issue facing the world today is global warming\/climate change. weather patterns have become increasingly more erratic over the past 5-10 years, and our summers are significantly hotter and winters significantly colder. it's rising to extreme levels, which is alarming.\n  ","406463":"\n  lately, i've been the one to start conversations first. :\/\/ i've been having trouble seeing who my friends really are because i noticed that none of them seem to text me first or ask how i'm doing, and i'm *always* the one reaching out. it's gotten quite exhausting and i don't know what to think of the situation anymore.\n  ","406464":"\n  no, i don't believe i'll ever be happy with the information i know. there's *always* room for growth and endless opportunities for education, and there's no limit as to how much we know or are educated on. i believe education is so important, and even if someone isn't in school or university, they should find opportunities to expand their mind.\n  ","406465":"\n  i would probably eliminate tumblr. it can honestly be such a toxic social media site, especially for young and impressionable kids,\n  ","406466":"\n  cortana from the halo series !! i've always loved her.\n  ","406467":"\n  travel alone. i've always wanted to go somewhere by myself and just exist without relying on anyone else, but i'm also afraid of driving to new places alone because of my driving anxiety.\n  ","406468":"\n  i believe the body positivity movement started out as a great ideology -- the idea that we should all love our bodies regardless of societal standards, because most people have \"unconventional\" body shapes, scars, disabilities, etc etc., and we shouldn't be judged on those things.\n  \n  however, in recent times, i also believe the body positivity movement has become jaded because of a lot of rhetoric involving fat positivity. this ideology puts forth the notion that we should accept ourselves even if we're overweight\/obese, and essentially not do anything to help ourselves.\n  \n  being overweight\/obese is a major health concern -- it can cause problems with the skeletal system, it can affect our cardiovascular system, and it can wreck havoc on simply the way our bodies function. it's not healthy to be overweight\/obese, which is why physicians always recommend diet and exercise to those who do fall into the overweight\/obese scale.\n  \n  being overweight or obese isn't something that should be glorified, in my opinion. if you're putting your own health first, then you should acknowledge that there's a problem that needs addressing. the fat positivity movement seems to sweep all of that under the rug, from my understanding. you can certainly be body positive while also attempting to lose weight, but the problem with body and\/or fat positivity is that often those who promote it don't acknowledge that being overweight or obese is extremely risky and unhealthy.\n  ","406469":"\n  coffee and\/or alcohol. i can't say no to either.\n  ","406470":"\n  i enjoy dipping french fries in ice cream, if that counts !! i don't know if other people do or don't like that, though.\n  \n  i also enjoy putting potato chips inside my cheeseburgers and hot dogs, lmaoo.\n  ","406471":"\n  oh man, i feel quite the opposite. if i wake up and i'm extremely thirsty, water is the most delicious thing in the world to me, lol.\n

friendship isn't something that's forced between two people. it has to happen naturally.\n  ","406475":"\n  depends on the nature of the relationship and why\/how you broke up. it's going to be different case by case. there will be some exes you can remain friends with without a problem, but there will also be others with whom you cannot maintain a friendship -- whether it might be because of resurrection of old feelings or its just toxic to both of you.\n  \n  if this is a question you're pondering to begin with, perhaps its better if you keep your distance from your ex. at least in the beginning. i find that most people need time to move on and find themselves outside of their former relationship before they can feel confident enough to allow that person back into their lives.\n

my person.\n  ","406484":"\n  things that can be answered by looking at my bio, like my career or my age.\n  ","406485":"\n  well, i'm glad that i give off that impression, haha. i simply don't discuss my morals on here, or the experiences i've had which made me developed whatever twisted moral code i have.\n  ","406486":"\n  lmaoo, no. my set of morals is questionable at best.\n  ","406487":"\n  initially, it was to protect us from the outside elements. then as time progressed, it became socially standard to wear clothing around other people because seeing the human body nude was interpreted as a s*xual thing.\n  ","406488":"\n  no, nudity isn't embarrassing -- it's simply the human body in its natural state.\n  ","406489":"\n  ultimately, no. the earth will live on regardless of whether or not humans existed.\n  ","406490":"\n  climate change\/global warming. it's drastically changing the way the earth operates and we're seeing it every season, weather patterns are getting increasingly more erratic.\n  ","406491":"\n  i don't like the term \"insanity\" because it only increases the stigma against mental illness. people use it without a care and it harms those who struggle with their mental health.\n  ","406492":"\n  there have only been a rare few times that i felt \"insane,\" and that hasn't happened in years. so yes.\n  ","406493":"\n  this is

we've just woken up and are having a cup of coffee together on the backyard patio. :'))\n  ","406495":"\n  social stigma, i suppose. talking to yourself when there are other people to witness is makes someone seem \"crazy,\" even though talking to yourself is perfectly common and healthy.\n  ","406496":"\n  i didn't have dinner yet.\n  ","406497":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n

honestly the only reason why i like using \"high quality\" makeup products, they end up lasting for a very long time because you're not layering at all. i usually only have to put one layer on as a base, then a second layer if i want a smokey eye or more dimension.\n  ","406505":"\n  aw aw, thank you ~~\n  ","406506":"\n  he's a disgusting human being, in my opinion. lmaoo. there's more to

colors are very pigmented. i used to buy drug store makeup, but it simply isn't up to par with the other products i've used, like too faced (which as you can tell is my favorite brand, lol).\n  \n  i do suggest colourpop cosmetics as a cheap alternative, though !! their makeup is pretty great and they're very inexpensive.\n  ","406508":"\n  obviously not.\n  ","406509":"\n  there aren't any spots that i enjoy in my neighborhood\/town. i usually go to other cities in order to enjoy different things, whether they're state parks or beaches or bars and restaurants. there's this one park on the north shore of long island that's absolutely beautiful and i always enjoy going there.\n  ","406510":"\n  there's this one club in town that my coworker dragged me to one day a few months ago, and i had a horrible time. the drinks were overpriced and not that great, there were people everywhere to the point where i could barely walk around, and the music was so loud to the point where i couldn't hear people talk.\n  \n  the club scene is definitely *not* my scene, i would much rather go to a quiet bar or coffee house to see my friends.\n  ","406511":"\n  ultimately, happiness. happiness comes from within us, within our joys in life and ability to be grateful and content with who we are and who we surround ourselves with. although we can purchase things that lessen our worries and give the impression of happiness, it's artificial happiness that only lasts for a brief period of time.\n  ","406512":"\n  my one virtue is that i'm compassionate towards people in need and especially towards animals. my one vice is alcohol -- i have no self control when it comes to drinking.\n  ","406513":"\n  most romantic comedies are stupid and overrated.\n  ","406514":"\n  when it comes to tasks that i don't like doing, i normally try to do them first to get them out of the way in order for me to spend my time on the things i actually enjoy. if i put them off until the last minute, then i'm going to spend that time worrying about those tasks until i have no choice but to do them.\n  ","406515":"\n  yeah, i would say i'm rather creative. i like to write creatively, as well as paint and draw and take photography.\n  ","406516":"\n  i like dominos much better than pizza hut. although, i've never had pizza hut other than the mini personal pies that they have at the drive thru, lmao.\n

people have often told me that i look like lady gaga.\n  ","406525":"\n  looks are great and all, but any sort of relationship (romantic or platonic) are based on the meshing of people's personalities. you can like someone for what they look like, but if that's the only reason you're their friend or partner, then the relationship is going to turn sour quite quickly.\n  ","406526":"\n  if i'm feeling stressed out, i try to take a night for myself and relax in bed with ambient lights on, my himalayan rock salt lamp on, a candle lit, perhaps a cup of coffee in my hand, and something enjoyable on tv.\n  ","406527":"\n  honestly, i view the term as something said in jest or in an ironic manner. i don't believe i've ever heard someone use the phrase in a serious tone, lol. however,

know what they're talking about.\n  ","406528":"\n  my mother got upset with me because i told her that me and my friend have been looking to rent a house together with two or three other friends. she doesn't believe it would be good for me, for whatever reason, even though moving out of my parents' house is my number one concern right now due to my mental health.\n  \n  honestly, i think it's because she doesn't want me to move out since i'm essentially a caretaker to her, along with my father. she would be losing a person in the house to do things for her that she can't do for herself, and i think that's what upsets her.\n  ","406529":"\n  gasoline, freshly cut grass, the crisp smell of the first snowfall, rain, pina coladas, firewood, jasmine, patchouli, dragon's blood incense, and roses.\n  ","406530":"\n  i do the same, i don't like using outrageous colors because they don't suit my face very well so i stick to neutrals, like peaches and browns and occasionally black. lately

spray. it works really well.\n  ","406536":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n  \n  i don't wear eyeliner, and my mascara is waterproof. i also use a lot of setting spray so that my makeup doesn't budge, lmaoo.\n

in 5 years' time.\n  ","406540":"\n  i've checked the country leaderboards on askfm a few times, but it isn't of much interest to me at all. apparently, i'm #53 in the united states. i'm also #8 out

feeling completely sick and didn't have a good sleep despite laying down for 10 hours straight, so i ended up calling out of work.\n  \n  i feel a bit better now than i did this morning, but it wouldn't be worth it to go into work now considering it takes me about 45 minutes to drive there and it's near the end of the day. so i'm just on my laptop, listening to music, and drinking a sh*tload of water to flush out my system.\n  ","406542":"\n  i've been involved in the internet since i was a young child. when i was a pre-teen, i didn't have many IRL friends, so i resorted to the internet to find like-minded individuals who had similar interests, and as a result, i befriended a lot of people that way. i posted on public forums related to my interests, especially music and writing, and i still talk to many of the friends i made through those sites.\n  \n  social media and the internet as a whole has allowed people to expand their friend pool, finding acceptance and caring people if they're lacking that in their real life. i probably wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for the friends i made online when i was a teenager. they shaped me into who i am and instilled in me a sense of hope and confidence.\n  ","406543":"\n  this may sound cynical, but no. we as a human species are prone to greedy and selfish behavior, which unfortunately is what propels most leaders to the top of their field, particularly in politics. the general public also has a close-minded way of looking at things, especially in america, and believe that their way is the best way and won't accept anything other than what they think to be right.\n  ","406544":"\n  by this time next year, i would like to have better control over my mental health, particularly with respect to my impulsivity and addictive tendencies. i need to develop better self control when it comes to certain things in my life.\n  \n  in the same vein, i also want to establish more self-confidence and overall be a better person in my own eyes. i want to get my life in order and accept more opportunities, especially traveling.\n  ","406545":"\n  the only thing askfm has done with respect to spending coins is offer these stupid
