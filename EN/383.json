to be to you, so it would be impossible for me to know whether or not i've changed. it also depends on when you previously knew me -- if it's been more than one year, then i most likely have changed.

-- when my boyfriend and i went out to dinner last night, nearly all of the waiters were talking about game of thrones, lol. we kept hearing people yell out, \"hodor ! hodor !\" every few minutes. it was amusing.\n  ","410995":"\n  lol, no. my graduating class had 300+ kids, and i was only ranked within the top 20 students of that class.\n  ","410996":"\n  i mean, i have store-bought artificial

that was mostly in the past (going back 2-3 years ago at least), and when we have a disagreement these days, it's more of a civil conversation than anything else. we don't get angry with each other, and we're trying to understand each other's perspectives more than anything.\n  ","410999":"\n  no, we've never cooked anything in the firepit before. it doesn't have anything on top of it that you

 ","411001":"\n  animosity is a strong word, so no. i'm disappointed more than anything else. marissa and i were never friends, so my feelings don't run deeply towards her or anything. however, i'm still disappointed in her behavior.\n  ","411002":"\n  i'm actually doing well. i had a productive day at work & i've just been relaxing with iced coffee since i got home about an hour ago. :'))\n  \n  i'm going to catch up on game of thrones tonight, since my boyfriend and i didn't watch it last night. i heard it was fairly anticlimactic, though.\n  ","411003":"\n  LOL, no. i've never been to hooters before. we went to texas roadhouse & got two appetizers and a full course meal.\n  ","411004":"\n  i don't think anyone is remaining friends with marissa after this incident. it's one thing to insult someone immaturely for their weight, but what she did today was beyond \"drama.\" she not only attempted to hurt one person through her behavior, but she also consciously attacked others through her narrow-minded viewpoints regarding women and fertility.\n  ","411005":"\n  i forgot to mention in my previous answer --\n  \n  marissa implied in her answers that the only reason females populate the earth is to be impregnated and give birth, and therefore, those who cannot give birth are automatically \"weak.\" HOWEVER, this ignores the fact that statistically, 1\/10 females cannot sustain a pregnancy, and 1\/4 females have miscarriages.\n  \n  you cannot rely on something you assume to be basic biology in order to undermine a person when the statistics are not in your favor. i'm not going to go into the feminist argument regarding the purpose of women, because it's 2019 and everyone knows that women are more than just baby-making machines, but you cannot deny scientific evidence that has been studied for decades.\n  \n  marissa's logic is null, and it only stems from her own internalized misogyny that she herself has to learn to cope with, instead of lashing out against other people who are complete strangers and don't fit into her small perspective of the world.\n  ","411006":"\n  her answers have since been deleted (unless my app screwed up), so i had to rely on receipts to find out that this was indeed true. i was hoping no one would go *that* low, but my mind is blown yet again.\n  \n  if y'all want my opinion, it's this -- insulting a person for their looks, their weight, whatever ... that's one thing, and that's petty drama. however, to go so far as to attack a person for losing something as intimate and personal as a pregnancy, that's one of the most vile things i've ever heard discussed on askfm.\n  \n  everyone knows that marissa has always been one for dramatic effect, likely due to her own need for attention (which isn't necessarily bad, everyone does need attention), but going down such a toxic and hurtful route is unhealthy and manipulative. this goes further than liberals v. conservatives, trans v. cis, gay v. straight, etc etc. this was a personal attack.\n  \n  i've only ever associated with marissa once, and that was when she called me on the phone to tell me the truth about cas 2-3 years ago. i appreciated her efforts, but that was a different time. people usually grow as they get older, but in this instance, her development has been hindered. i honestly hope she does mature and realize the implications of her words and actions, because calling everyone derogatory names and trying to take the \"moral\" high road won't help this time.\n  ","411007":"\n  i normally don't care, but that doesn't mean i don't want to remain aware of what's happening -- and whats happening was enough for mariah to come back, so obviously it was big.\n  \n  please hold. i'm being briefed rn.\n  ","411008":"\n  my feed is filled with stupid polls, so it isn't showing me much. it's only going back an hour ago. :\/\/\n  ","411009":"\n  this doesn't tell me what happened, lmao. regardless of what you think my reaction would be, my inbox still blew up this afternoon and i have zero idea of what happened.\n  \n  so if someone could kindly inform me, that would be wonderful.\n

food, i'm stuffed. lmao.\n  ","411013":"\n  in my boyfriend's backyard. he has a firepit.\n  ","411014":"\n  i'm all right. just waiting for my boyfriend to get home from work so i can see him tonight.\n  \n  we were supposed to have a fire tonight, but it just started raining. :\/\/ sorta bummed about that.\n  ","411015":"\n  thanks, i appreciate it ~~\n  ","411016":"\n  probably !! my boyfriend and i might watch it tonight. if not, then tomorrow night.\n  ","411017":"\n  it is drama -- there's no threatening behavior, no one is at risk of getting hurt, and its just petty words on a screen. if the situation called for disciplinary action, then perhaps i would have said something. but someone misgendering a friend of mine, when that friend is more than capable of speaking for himself, isn't a serious crime. it's simply drama.\n  ","411018":"\n  i don't think you guys understand the words \"stop spreading drama.\"\n  \n  i don't care about other people's opinions because they don't affect my life. it isn't a thought that crosses my mind, and if i focused on other people's views then i wouldn't be able to progress forward with myself.\n  ","411019":"\n  this is a good perspective !! i never thought about it that way.\n  ","411020":"\n  the whole \"if you love something, set it free. if it comes back, it's yours. if it doesn't, it never was.\"\n  \n  if you love something, or someone in this instance, why would you willingly let them go without trying to make it work ?? i don't believe that love never existed if the person never returns to you either. people grow, change, and adapt, and just because someone leaves you and moves on doesn't mean they never loved you. it could be as simple as someone outgrowing you because you don't provide them with what they need anymore.\n  ","411021":"\n  definitely not, lmao. the only cardinal virtue i possess is perhaps fortitude because i've persevered through hardship.\n  ","411022":"\n  i don't have any live broadcast apps, so i can't help you.\n  ","411023":"\n  i don't follow anyone who's transphobic, to my knowledge.\n  ","411024":"\n  i don't care enough about other people's opinions to have an opinion of my own. stop trying to spread drama.\n  ","411025":"\n  i follow haydn, so i've been seeing his posts. no need to send me links to his page anonymously.\n  ","411026":"\n  ashkenazi jewish

race.\n  ","411027":"\n  i don't really know much about race identities like this, but if i was native american, then i would consider myself to be both white and native american (as well as jewish). most people these days are fairly mixed anyway, and 25 percent is a large percentage and i would likely embrace my native american side.\n  ","411028":"\n  that's only 50 percent, lol. it depends on the other percentages.\n  ","411029":"\n  as i just stated earlier, i just finished up the laundry and now i'm relaxing and listening to music. i'm also debating on either taking a nap or drinking another seltzer.\n  ","411030":"\n  yes, i am white.\n  ","411031":"\n  i'm doing well. i just finished up the laundry & now i'm listening to billie eilish again.\n  ","411032":"\n  uh, haydn is a

else's business, lol. he's going to be a man regardless of what people think of him.\n  ","411033":"\n  any of the times i've gone on vacation with my boyfriend were happy moments. it's nice to spend a weekend with someone you love where you have no real responsibilities and can do whatever your heart desires.\n  ","411034":"\n  friendship cannot be forced -- it should happen naturally. i'm not on askfm to make friends, either way. i'm on askfm to answer questions and occasionally ask questions to the people i follow.\n  ","411035":"\n  my weekend has been good. i didn't do much yesterday at all, but today i woke up early and did three loads of laundry (the fourth is in the washer), as well as finished up my freelance work. i'm planning on seeing my boyfriend later after he gets out of work, and if it doesn't rain, then we're going to have a fire in his backyard.\n  ","411036":"\n  hello. do you have a question ??\n  ","411037":"\n  no, i have no desire to do that.\n  ","411038":"\n

doesn't personally affect you, then why be bothered by it ??\n  \n  you can try to negate my gender for the rest of my time spent on askfm, but it doesn't make a difference to me. you're wasting your breath sending me anonymous messages and exerting unnecessary time and energy over something out of your control. it's pointless.\n  ","411129":"\n  no, it doesn't really bother me if people misgender me (unless they know i'm non-binary and insist on calling me a woman out of spite). in general, other people's opinions have no affect on my gender and their opinions ultimately make no difference in the long run.\n  ","411130":"\n  you can insist that i'm a woman all you want, but your suggestions are ultimately futile and don't make a difference to me. regardless of your stance on gender identity, i'm still non-binary and that won't change.\n  ","411131":"\n  no, i'm clearly non-binary. the medication i take has no correlation with my gender.\n  ","411132":"\n  other people's gender have no affect on my own gender, lol. i'm glad that those people discovered who they are, but that doesn't automatically mean i'm not non-binary.\n  ","411133":"\n  i'm assigned female at birth, so

health insurance.\n  ","411135":"\n  i think it ultimately depends on the individual -- sometimes baby steps are warranted because it helps people ease into change, while other times people are more comfortable taking big steps because it would be the only thing that works for them.\n  \n  i.e. my boyfriend required big steps when he went sober, otherwise he never would have broken the cycle of addiction if he tried to take baby steps. he quit cold turkey and has been sober from drugs ever since (it's been a few years now), and he rarely drinks alcohol except on special occasions every few months.\n  ","411136":"\n  i reconnected with an old friend a few months ago -- i have an online friend whom i spoke to for years when i was a teenager, and she ended up becoming one of my closest friends. we grew apart when i entered college because that's what happens during life at times, but i messaged her recently to gain a deeper understanding of my past since i don't remember much about my early life at all.\n  \n  i last made a new friend back in november. there was a new woman who was hired at my job, and we clicked immediately.\n  ","411137":"\n  no, i disagree with the quote. sometimes rumors can he harmful to a person's reputation, especially if the rumors are false, and it's valid for a person to complain about rumors spread about them.\n  \n  i also believe it's sometimes warranted for a person to clear the air and acknowledge the rumors by discussing the truth, otherwise people are going to believe whatever is being spread about them and give them the wrong impression.\n  ","411138":"\n  i would have kept a diary from the time i was around 7-10 years old -- i don't remember anything about my life from before the age of 11, and it would be interesting to

on what time he wakes up. if he wakes up early enough, we may go to the diner for some breakfast. :'))\n  ","411142":"\n  i celebrate christmas, halloween, thanksgiving, and birthdays.\n  \n  i don't generally celebrate easter, valentine's day, or new years eve\/day. occasionally my boyfriend and i will buy small gifts of appreciation on valentine's day, but it depends on our availability that particular year and if we're even seeing each other to begin with. we don't place much importance in commercialized holidays like that.\n  ","411143":"\n  they work for some people, but not for others. it takes a high level of dedication, trust, and commitment for two people to be in a successful long distance relationship, and it's sometimes more difficult to be long distance than if you were in a relationship where you saw one another often.\n  \n  personally speaking, i could never be in a long distance relationship. i need to be able to see my partner frequently for my own needs.\n

these coins in the first place.\n  ","411145":"\n  it has to do with consent -- when women wear bikinis, they're consenting to being seen in such attire as it's their own personal choice. being stumbled upon in your undergarments, however, does not include consent, which is why women \"make a huge deal\" out of being seen in them.\n  ","411146":"\n  i use the 12-hour clock.\n  ","411147":"\n  no, i'm not patriotic.\n  ","411148":"\n  i just tried recording a video, but it doesn't work for me. idk -- my voice is sorta neutral, not high-pitched but not really low either. i'm also sorta monotone.\n  ","411149":"\n  stayed awake with me, despite them needing to be asleep, because i was going through a mental health crisis and they wanted to ensure my safety. i don't talk to this person often anymore because we grew apart in recent years, but i'll always appreciate their dedication and compassion.\n  ","411150":"\n  everyone has a different purpose or reason for existing. and often times, we go through life trying to find that purpose within ourselves. i've always gone by the notion of \"the purpose of life is to create a life with purpose.\"\n  ","411151":"\n  they\/them are my pronouns. just because it doesn't bother me if people refer to me as different pronouns doesn't mean that my actual pronouns are insignificant. i included them in my bio so that people who are new to my page are aware that that's how they should refer to me.\n  ","411152":"\n  i think it's alarming that it just became law. i already explained my stance on abortion in a previous, similar answer (i'm pro-choice), so i believe that the ohio law is incredibly radical and uninformed. most people do not know that they're even pregnant by six weeks' time -- that's only two weeks after a missed period. and regardless of whether or not a heartbeat can be determined, six weeks is lightyears prior to when a fetus is actually viable.\n  ","411153":"\n  the most difficult goodbye was seeing my boyfriend's mother's face for the very last time during the wake when she passed away in 2010. i only knew her for less than a year at that point, but it was difficult because of the devastating impact her passing had on the rest of the family. her death was not deserved, and she still had so many fruitful years ahead of her.\n  ","411154":"\n  i'm not a parent. however, i would say that keeping their child safe and allowing them to flourish is perhaps the single most important duty of a parent. when you're a parent, your child's safety, happiness, and wellbeing come first and foremost.\n  ","411155":"\n  my relationship. initially i was going to say my job, but jobs will always come and go -- the relationships you make with other people are so much more substantial and meaningful, and i value my current relationship so much. my job is obviously incredibly important to me and is a significant aspect of my life, but my relationship with my boyfriend is perhaps the single most important thing in my life right now.\n  ","411156":"\n  i would choose to change my commute to and from work so that it isn't as much of a hassle every morning and evening. it takes me an hour each way, and it completely drains me mentally, especially since driving increases my anxiety to begin with.\n  ","411157":"\n  if i had to choose just one material possession, i would likely pick a painting that my boyfriend commissioned someone to do last year for me (the artist is actually a good friend of ours). the painting came out beautiful and it's a true testament to my boyfriend's love for me, because he had it made during a troubling time in my life.\n  ","411158":"\n  i find that \"artist\" is more all-encompassing, because writing isn't the only creative endeavor i have. i also draw, paint, and do photography.\n  ","411159":"\n  not the same sort of god that's portrayed in other religions, no. buddhism doesn't have a belief in a personal god, in particular. i don't remember much about hinduism, though.\n  ","411160":"\n  nicotine and caffeine. i also recently acknowledged that i have a problem with alcohol that i've been trying to work hard on overcoming.\n  ","411161":"\n  i don't really care about what other people do or what their beliefs are, personally speaking. if someone doesn't believe in gender identity and refuses to use a trans person's pronouns, then that's something they have to handle on their own.\n  \n  unfortunately, you cannot expect everyone to respect you solely for existing, and there will always be people who will disagree with you, whether that disagreement is regarding someone's opinions, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc etc. i'm not bothered if people misgender me, for example, but i know plenty of other trans & non-binary people who are greatly troubled by it.\n  ","411162":"\n  courtney is one of my closest friends -- i feel like i can tell her anything going on in my life, and she's always willing to listen to my troubles and give her input when necessary. she's nonjudgmental and is always willing to offer her help in any way she can, and i appreciate her so, so much.\n  ","411163":"\n

fine.\n  ","411169":"\n  i don't really eat sandwiches often. however, i do enjoy going to subway and getting a BLT with avocado spread and cheese (usually on an italian herb & cheese bread).\n  ","411170":"\n  not really, no. everyone gossips to some extent, whether they realize it or not. i think it borderlines on \"bad\" behavior when you're gossiping about a person to the point where you're spreading harmful or toxic rhetoric about a person that simply isn't true, because that's slander at that point.\n  ","411171":"\n  it isn't a law, it was just a proposed bill that doesn't seem like it's going to go anywhere (whew!). in short, the bill proposed that people should be charged with homicide if they get an abortion, which implies the death penalty in the state of texas.\n  \n  i'm pro-choice, so of course i disagree highly with the bill entirely. i believe that people have the right to get an abortion because a fetus is not viable outside of the womb until much, much later in pregnancy, and even people who have abortions after x amount of weeks only do so in dire medical emergencies. abortions should be covered, even if partially, under health insurance as well.\n  ","411172":"\n  thank you, kittie !! i hope you have a great weekend too.\n  \n  i don't have any real plans, no. like every weekend, i am going to work on some freelance writing and do household chores, but those aren't exactly \"plans,\" lol.\n  ","411173":"\n  i simply didn't believe in what i was being taught, so i told my parents that i wasn't going to attend religion classes or church anymore because i didn't believe in the existence of god.\n  ","411174":"\n  gender non-conforming, to my understanding, is just a synonym for people who are genderfluid, non-binary, transgender, etc etc. at least that's the way i've always personally seen it used.\n  \n  i don't think it has anything to do with social desires, otherwise someone would be labeled a \"transtrender\" -- or whatever the term is for someone who's pretending to be trans when really they're just not ascribing to gender stereotypes, lol.\n  ","411175":"\n  i actually had a pretty good day. :'))\n  \n  the CEO of the company took a look at the draft of the project i've been working on (alongside the graphic designer), and she's extremely pleased with the way it's coming out. that gave me a lot of relief because i was worried that she wasn't going to like it.\n  \n  i also received a $20 bonus today because my supervisor received a favorable testimonial regarding one of the assignments i worked on months ago !!\n  ","411176":"\n  i'm not religious, no. i was raised to believe in catholicism, but i denounced the religion when i was a teenager.\n  \n  i did go through stages where i experimented with other religions, particularly buddhism and hinduism, but i don't believe in organized religion in the present day.\n  ","411177":"\n  no, i wouldn't do stand up comedy. i have social anxiety and i get extremely nervous and panicked when i'm around groups of people, especially in settings where the spotlight is on me.\n  ","411178":"\n  i actually just did a quick google search on gender dysphoria, and i was slightly wrong -- what they *did* remove upon the release of the DSM-5 was \"gender identity disorder\" and replaced it with \"gender dysphoria,\" basically because they're portraying that being gender non-conforming isn't a disorder in itself. however, gender dysphoria is described as feelings of significant distress associated with gender, and the distress someone feels *is* disordered.\n  ","411179":"\n  i thought they took that out of the DSM, though ?? i could be wrong, i haven't looked it up in a long time.\n  ","411180":"\n  the entire purpose of askfm is to ask

sense to me because if someone didn't believe in a gender spectrum, then they probably wouldn't use a trans person's correct pronouns. if they did use a person's correct pronouns and was conscious that the trans person went by those pronouns, then that indicates a greater respect for that individual than previously thought.\n  \n  i think it is transphobic for people to think that being trans is a mental illness, though. there's no correlation between having a mental illness and being trans.\n  ","411197":"\n  perhaps it doesn't matter to you personally, but you can't speak on behalf of

regarding my behavior.\n  ","411356":"\n  i use snapchat to talk to a few friends every day, but i wasn't aware that there were new updates.\n  ","411357":"\n  i wouldn't really be able to put it on a

object to that).\n  ","411358":"\n  i try my hardest to help my close friends & boyfriend whenever i possibly can. often i'll put my own concerns on the back burner while i help them because i believe that their issues are more important than mine.\n  ","411359":"\n  no, not on purpose at the very least. i can't say that it definitely hasn't happened because i wouldn't be surprised if something

someone needs help.\n  ","411362":"\n  no, i'm not a gullible person. i don't trust most people in general, so it's difficult for me to accept what other people say as true without doing my own

lot of fun being in the car with them because they're hilarious together, and the scenery was also beautiful going into the mountains as well.\n  ","411388":"\n  i've never driven any difficult vehicles -- the only cars i've driven have been my own, and i'm hesitant to drive anyone else's car because i wouldn't want to get into an accident. i don't believe i've ever driven my boyfriend's car either because he has a truck, which is pretty much 2x the size of my own car, lol.\n  ","411389":"\n  i suppose i exceed the speed limit every day, but it's mainly due to keeping up with traffic because everyone else speeds as well. i rarely speed if i'm alone on the highway or on back roads because i'm paranoid that a cop is around.\n  ","411390":"\n  i think tailgating is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. if you have to brake suddenly, the person tailgating you could slam into the back of your car because they weren't allowing enough space between the cars.\n  \n  it's

isn't selfish. you cannot force yourself to love someone, and if you're having doubts about your relationship, you cannot ignore those signs. you shouldn't settle for someone because you feel obligated to be with them, and as much as ending things with him will hurt, you do deserve to be content in your relationships.\n  \n  understandably he puts his child first because that's how

see people with bad luck or experiencing struggle in their lives, it doesn't make the things that happen to them any more fair.\n  ","411473":"\n  \"insanity\" is perhaps the wrong word to use in this

fictional stories hint at, but don't explicitly portray, a same sex relationship, normally in an effort to appeal to the lgbtq+ community without actually writing lgbtq+ characters.\n  \n  with that in mind, i think it's wrong. it's detrimental to the lgbtq+ community because they're basically regarded as an after-thought, instead of a character being explicitly written as a lgbtq+ character from the very start. it reminds me of what jk rowling has been doing these past few years, stating that some characters are actually gay, even though she never wrote those characters like that to begin

darkness, you can still see your surroundings and can correctly perceive disturbances around you. without that ability to see, you're basically traversing your surroundings completely blind and cannot be alert to what's around you.\n  ","411585":"\n  it depends on what sort of emotion i'm feeling, and what happened in my life to prompt that feeling. i generally express my feelings openly,

including cleaning the house (dusting, vacuuming, washing, scrubbing, etc etc), doing my family's laundry, helping with the cooking, taking out the garbage, picking up my mother's medication from the pharmacy, and occasionally grocery shopping.\n  \n  it isn't hard, it's just necessary. when something is necessary, you simply do it regardless of how easy or hard it is.\n  ","411653":"\n  no, i've never had a reason to monitor my screen time. i'm not on my phone for the majority of the day until i get home from work.\n  ","411654":"\n  i normally just check social media or watch youtube videos until i think i'm ready to try going to sleep again. which probably isn't good, considering screen time before bed is generally unhealthy. but i know if i picked up a book to read, i would get engrossed in it and spend an additional x amount of hours reading instead of sleeping.\n  ","411655":"\n  no, especially if you're considering learning a language as an adult. it's much easier for children to learn languages because their brains are more malleable, and it becomes increasingly more difficult to learn a new language as someone gets older.\n  ","411656":"\n  this is something i've never heard before.\n  ","411657":"\n  my high school senior prank wasn't a prank at all, because my class was composed of a bunch of really stupid people who couldn't distinguished the difference between a joke and legit criminal activity. they ended up spray-painting the building on the sides and on the roof and slashed the security guards' tires.\n  ","411658":"\n  i don't believe i have any enemies, unless i do and they haven't made themselves known to me. i've had conflicts with people in the past, but that was years ago and i doubt there's any resentment lingering at this point.\n

straight on, no.\n  ","411660":"\n  yeah, i ended up getting two of them today -- one in the morning when i woke up to check my inbox, and another when i cleared my notifications on my lunch break. i don't know why it showed up twice.\n  \n  it's probably an april fools' joke, but it's a stupid one at that. lol.\n  ","411661":"\n  i don't have a beauty routine, lol. occasionally i'll apply witch hazel, but there isn't anything i do on a regular basis besides wash my face with warm water 2-3x per day.\n  ","411662":"\n  i live in new york, and the furthest from new york i've been has been to austin, texas.\n  ","411663":"\n  i actually had a really nice day at work today !! i wasn't overwhelmed like i anticipated i was going to be, and i spent most of the day proofreading and adding details to biographies of clients who are appearing in one of our annual features to fit spatial restrictions. also, my supervisor put on the skyrim soundtrack over the work radio, so that was pleasant.\n  \n  my best friend just came home, and she's staying here until wednesday, so i might go out and see her tonight.\n  ","411664":"\n  not so much lately as i used to in previous years, no. attending therapy for the past two years has taught me that dwelling in the past only leads to further discontent and frustration, especially considering the past cannot be changed. it's better to be mindful of the present moment while also acknowledging what the past has done to change you into the person you currently are.\n  ","411665":"\n  not really, no. i don't have anything exciting planned for the summer, and i'm not looking forward to the sweltering heat.\n  ","411666":"\n  no. the artist and their artwork are one in the same. you cannot acknowledge one without the other.\n  ","411667":"\n  somewhat, yes. i've never ridden any big roller coasters because they seemed intimidating to me, and the few smaller ones i went on frightened me a little bit. however, i love water rides for some reason.\n  ","411668":"\n  i ordered sushi for dinner tonight. i'm going to eat it in about 20 minutes.\n  ","411669":"\n  no ?? as long as you're drinking responsibly, there isn't anything wrong with drinking games.\n  ","411670":"\n  yes, i absolutely love harry potter !! i was a fanatic back in the 1990s and early 2000s, i read every book as soon as they were published, and i went to a few midnight premieres of the movies.\n  ","411671":"\n  no, that's definitely not justified. just because you got hurt in the past doesn't mean it's acceptable to hurt a completely different person in the same way you were hurt.\n  ","411672":"\n  my weekend was busy, but fulfilling. saturday was spent cleaning out the basement, bringing up old furniture to throw out, and moving the old fridge into the garage to sell. then on sunday, i cleaned out most of the spare room upstairs and did 3 loads of laundry.\n  ","411673":"\n  probably europe !! i've always wanted to visit the UK and spain.\n  ","411674":"\n  this is a really insensitive question to ask someone, just fyi.\n  ","411675":"\n  yeah, this past week it's been in the 50s (fahrenheit).\n  ","411676":"\n  i need a

??\n  ","411684":"\n  i'm not really \"celebrating\" it, i'm just raising awareness of it on social media by posting about it.\n  ","411685":"\n  ? happy trans day of visibility, everyone !! ?\n  ","411686":"\n  i don't have a new phone. i have the samsung galaxy s7.\n  ","411687":"\n  not really. i just do what i have to do, like laundry or cleaning or cooking or running errands. if i'm feeling particularly bad that day, then those are challenges in themselves.\n  ","411688":"\n  ???\n  \n  a dog is an animal, not a gender. lmao.\n  ","411689":"\n  this is inherently incorrect. gender identity isn't correlated with mental illness, and non-binary simply means that an individual does not adhere to either of the gender binaries.\n  ","411690":"\n  you're anonymous and i'm not interested in making new friends.\n  ","411691":"\n  if you read my bio, you would see that i'm non-binary.\n  \n  however, just because i posted a picture with underarm hair 3-4 years ago doesn't mean that i never shave it, lol. i shave when i feel like shaving because no one is under any obligation to shave. it should be a personal choice.\n  ","411692":"\n  i don't even know who that is.\n  ","411693":"\n  i like body hair in general, but what i find attractive ultimately depends on the individual.\n  ","411694":"\n  i've never researched into it, so i'm not entirely sure.\n

randomly post their opinion in my inbox without something prompting it first. i normally just delete them. people aren't willing to have civil discussions about different perspectives, especially if they're convinced that they're right and everyone else is wrong.\n  ","411698":"\n  LOL. i don't even know why i bothered explaining when i already knew they were gonna be like \"lol you're wrong.\" oh well.\n  ","411699":"\n  my day has been rather slow. i woke up around 8am and have been lazy around the house ever since. i'm supposed to be cleaning one of the rooms of the house since it's basically a storage area right now, but i haven't felt motivated.\n  \n  i don't have an easter break.\n  ","411700":"\n  yeah it's extremely slow. i only get a question every few days.\n  ","411701":"\n  i have an account on tellonym (the link is in my bio).\n  \n  it's essentially the same thing as askfm, except the only option is to be anonymous. you also can't \"reply\" to people's answers, you can only send new questions or statements.\n  ","411702":"\n  LOL i saw that coming from a mile away. you already said you were going to oppose my views.\n  ","411703":"\n  racism is a form of oppression that's based upon historical evidence. it's geared toward people of color in general, and white people cannot be oppressed because they've always been in a position of power. that's why white people don't experience racism. it's systemic oppression.\n  \n  however, white people do face individual instances of discrimination based on their race. discrimination isn't rooted in oppression. it's simply a mindset.\n  ","411704":"\n  thank you !!\n  ","411705":"\n  i've considered it, yes. if i get ever tired of the long hair, i might have to buzz it so that the two sides are even again.\n  ","411706":"\n  if you're intent on proving me wrong before i even state the reasons, then there's no use trying to explain them to you. you're going to reject what i have to say anyway, so it would be a waste of my time to tell you.\n  ","411707":"\n  no, people who are white don't experience racism. they experience discrimination.\n  ","411708":"\n  pajamas.\n  ","411709":"\n  no, i wasn't aware of that fact. if it's actually true, i don't care enough to research it either.\n  ","411710":"\n  i honestly have no clue. it isn't something i've ever thought about before.\n  ","411711":"\n  i've always enjoyed their music, and they used to be a guilty pleasure of mine, haha. also if you haven't heard it before, their song \"house of gold\" is probably my favorite.\n  ","411712":"\n  thank you !! idk if you like TOP or not, but their song \"chlorine\" is pretty good.\n  ","411713":"\n  LOL. i can kinda see where you're coming from with that.\n  ","411714":"\n  everyone has a different perception of love & what a relationship should entail. likewise, marriage is not a necessity and people should not feel obligated to get married. these days, people are more likely to experiment and push off marriage until they're absolutely certain they want to marry their partner, and a lot of people are also emphasizing their careers instead of relationships, marriage, or starting a family.\n  ","411715":"\n  no. i don't talk to people privately either.\n  ","411716":"\n  i don't discuss that on askfm.\n  ","411717":"\n  strangers talking to me randomly is creepy to me. when people get too close when they're talking to you, or even just in general. certain questions people ask or statements they've made can be creepy. i also usually get vibes off of people at times which makes me wary of them.\n  ","411718":"\n  ideally, friends should be loyal to your friendship, not sugarcoat the truth to you, and push you to be the best version of yourself you can be. i only have a handful of friends, but i prefer it that way. i would rather have a few close friends than a lot of acquaintances.\n  \n  i normally discontinue friendships if they're toxic to my well being or they irritate me more than they bring me joy.\n  ","411719":"\n  no. i don't give my snapchat out publicly.\n  ","411720":"\n  \"weak\" by AJR ;\n  \n\n

it does.\n  ","411722":"\n  \"did you stick to your goals?\" is the only question i can think of. i have a lot of goals that i'm working towards right now and i'm determined to see them through.\n  ","411723":"\n  i agree with this statement. most tests are standardized and don't take into account students' various methods of learning. some students are just inept at taking exams, and their understanding of the material is more hands-on than anything else. someone can be intelligent without being good at a conventional school because there are multiple forms of intelligence as well.\n  ","411724":"\n  i'm emotionally strong, but that's because i spent the majority of my life living in not so ideal situations and i was forced to become accustomed to dealing with emotional pain. because of that, i can handle emotional pain far better than physical pain.\n  \n  that being said, i'm extremely sensitive on a physical scale and i cannot handle much physical pain at all. sometimes my boyfriend holds me too tightly and it ends up hurting me for hours afterwards (obviously that wasn't his intention). my body is just very sensitive to pain for some reason.\n  ","411725":"\n  i would take my boyfriend with me in a heartbeat. we deserve some time away from the hustle and struggle of living on this earth, lol.\n  ","411726":"\n  if i was allowed a third option, i would choose not to go through either door. it's useless to live in the past because you cannot change what has happened to you, and the most you can do is learn from your experiences and utilize them to make your present moments and future brighter. at the same time, however, living in the future takes away from the present moment because the future could change at any point. the future isn't guaranteed either.\n  \n  i would rather stay where i am now, because i've come to terms with my past and i'll deal with the future as it comes to me.\n  ","411727":"\n  i don't think there's any movie i can quote word-for-word at the moment, sadly. i don't watch movies very often at all. although when i was much younger, i used to be able to quote harry potter & the sorcerer's stone word-for-word because i had seen it so often.\n  ","411728":"\n  i'm definitely more \"right brain\" -- i'm much more creative\/artistic than analytical, and i always enjoyed the arts more than the sciences. i have a natural ability for writing and painting, and while i also used to understand mathematics and other technical concepts well, the arts just came easily to me.\n  ","411729":"\n  my family sorta celebrates mother's day, in the aspect that we usually purchase flowers for my mother and have a special dinner that night. we don't do anything too extravagant, though.\n  ","411730":"\n  yeah, on quite a few occasions.\n  ","411731":"\n  not really, no. i simply haven't done anything that warrants being an inspiration to other people. i've struggled in the past, but i haven't exactly risen above those challenges and i still very much struggle on a regular basis with various things.\n  ","411732":"\n  no, i can't say that i do. i'm not ashamed of anything that brings me pleasure.\n  ","411733":"\n  i've met people who had narcissistic traits, but they were never diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder.\n  ","411734":"\n  no, lol. taking care of a dog is a responsibility, and you're very much in a way acting as their parent. the responsibilities aren't the same when it comes to children versus dogs, obviously, but i don't think it's insulting to mothers when people call themselves dog moms or dog parents.\n  ","411735":"\n  my boyfriend telling me that he was proud of me last night.\n  ","411736":"\n  unfortunately, no.  the stuff i was moving around and cleaning were just things in the house that needed to get done -- there was a lot of old furniture in the basement that needed to be broken up and put out on the curb for garbage, among other things.\n  ","411737":"\n  aw, thank you !!\n  ","411738":"\n  i don't think anyone is that type of person. people should make their own conclusions, not blindly follow the opinions of others.\n  ","411739":"\n  there's no guaranteed way. just be yourself & the right person will come along eventually. if someone doesn't like you for who you are, then they're not worth pursuing anyway.\n  ","411740":"\n  i feel productive af, but i'm still so bored. i literally spent the entire morning moving furniture & cabinets from the basement out to the garage and cleaning the entire living room and master bedroom, and i'm also on my third load of laundry for the day. despite all of this, i'm bored as hell. i'm still planning on going through boxes that are piled up in a different room and showering tonight too, lmao.\n  \n  someone ask me questions ~~\n  ","411741":"\n  it ultimately depends on who i'm around, lol. if i'm around people i don't know very well, then i hold in my temper quite well. you would never even know i'm angry.\n  \n  however, if i'm close with you, then you can clearly see my temper written all over my face and i also have no issue with venting about what's angering me.\n  ","411742":"\n  i don't have an \"evil\" inner voice, but i do have a portion of me that's extremely self-deprecating, toxic, and hurtful. regardless of how much mental health treatment i've gone through, i think that side of myself will always somewhat exist -- it's just a matter of how i combat those thoughts and rise above my impulses.\n  \n  lately i haven't been dealing with them well at all, but i'm trying to build myself from the ground up with the support of my boyfriend and therapist.\n  ","411743":"\n  no, i don't believe in heaven or hell.\n  ","411744":"\n  my best friend doesn't use askfm. but i tell her frequently how much i value our friendship, and she's well aware of how much she has aided my life and has been a source of comfort during times of crisis. she's been there for me through everything.\n  ","411745":"\n  i don't think it's inherently right to make assumptions about a person's self esteem solely because they choose not to post photos of themselves on askfm. their unwillingness to post photos could mean a plethora of things, whether that's because they *are* self conscious, or because they simply want to maintain their own privacy.\n  \n  it doesn't make me suspicious of anyone, no. fake accounts are pretty easy to discover because usually they *do* post photos, except it's obviously not of themselves. that's a lot different than finding a person on askfm who simply is uncomfortable posting a selfie.\n  ","411746":"\n  i don't believe so, no. it's a lot more common these days to see people splitting with their partner in pursuit of someone who suits them better, rather than couples who stay together even though they're unhappy. in general, there's a lot more conversation regarding what's a healthy versus unhealthy relationship, which i think is really good.\n  ","411747":"\n  depends on my mood tbh !! it ranges from alternative rock to hip hop to lo-fi\/chillhop, as well as classical music (i.e. video game soundtracks).\n  ","411748":"\n  i didn't shave my head when i was 12, haha. the first time i shaved my head, i was in my mid-20s. prior to that, i always had either long hair or a pixie cut.\n  ","411749":"\n  i own red lipstick, yes.\n  ","411750":"\n  i don't believe \"brave\" is the right word, haha. more like indecisive and impulsive. however, i've been cutting & coloring my hair since i was basically 12 years old, so it doesn't phase me anymore. it's just hair and it grows back.\n  ","411751":"\n  i'm honestly not sure -- it probably stems back to my childhood & has psychological connotations to it somewhere, and it's stuck with me through adulthood.\n  ","411752":"\n  no, it was something i wanted done for a really long time. my initial intention was to shave the entire half of my head, but i started out with a small undercut just to ease into the idea.\n  \n  ... then a few months later, i shaved the entire side of my head on impulse. lmao.\n  ","411753":"\n  if it's cold outside or raining, then yeah.\n  ","411754":"\n  i've always enjoyed the autumn & winter months more than the spring & summer months, so i don't think i would want to hibernate for the winter. that's essentially me sleeping through my favorite seasons, haha.\n  \n  although i have to admit -- the weather today has been absolutely beautiful. it's the warmest it's been so far in 2019 (around 60-65 degrees fahrenheit), and it feels wonderful to go outside without a coat on.\n  ","411755":"\n  i actually had orange hair at one point when i was in high school, lol. i unfortunately don't have the photos, though. that was probably 11-12 years ago.\n  ","411756":"\n  thank you !! i usually ask for a 1 or a 2, depending on when i think i might get another shave. i like having a small bit of stubble there.\n  ","411757":"\n  thank you, friend !! it's one of my favorites besides the purple\/pink. i might try emerald green next.\n  ","411758":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n  ","411759":"\n  it's blue. you can see it in my other photos.\n  ","411760":"\n  if you're talking about my current profile picture, then it's an old photograph. lol. however, my hair is the same style now as it was back then, just longer & a different color.\n  \n  thank you ~~\n  ","411761":"\n  i think they saw that i liked your response to them this morning, which is probably how they found me. regardless, i think it's hilarious. i haven't heard comments like these since i was 12 years old.\n  ","411762":"\n  i would say this was another poor attempt at an insult, but considering this is *somewhat* in basic english, i'll nevertheless applaud you on your effort. your grammar is, at the very least, better in this message compared to previous messages.\n  \n  however, i should point out that you don't need the \"a\" in front of very, and you misspelled \"pupils.\" kudos on using the right form of \"you're,\" though !! many people find that one tricky.\n  ","411763":"\n  this literally makes zero sense. if you're attempting to insult dera or myself, you're doing a pretty poor job at it.\n  \n  i will provide you with one (1) more attempt.\n  ","411764":"\n  the clocks went forward a few weeks ago. regardless, i prefer the winter weather over summer weather.\n  ","411765":"\n  we don't really have many friends, but we have our respective friends whom we've both met and have become friends with as well, if that makes sense. his friends are also my friends and vice versa.\n  \n  i don't think there's anyone that he's friends with who i dislike, though. he only has a handful of people he considers a friend.\n  ","411766":"\n  yes, i'm in love with my boyfriend.\n  ","411767":"\n  breaking news ; a stranger on the internet has different tastes than another stranger on the internet. fascinating.\n  ","411768":"\n  absolutely obsessed with my new theme.\n  ","411769":"\n  in most cases, no. there's no reason why you can't talk to your partner and let them know why you're unhappy, and either try to fix the relationship or break up. the only exception that i can think of would be if someone was in an abvsive relationship and started dating someone else in an attempt to escape from that situation.\n  ","411770":"\n  no, i haven't tried yoga in years.\n  ","411771":"\n  every relationship has boundaries that shouldn't be crossed, and it varies from couple to couple. everyone should ideally be able to do what they want -- within reason -- as long as it doesn't hurt the relationship or their partner. what's hurtful to others varies wildly, so it goes on an individualized basis.\n  ","411772":"\n  it's been quite a few years since i've actually gone to a store to exchange something, lol. i don't really go clothes shopping, and when i do it's online, so it's more of a matter of returning it to the retailer and getting a credit back as opposed to going to a physical store for an exchange.\n  \n  however, i've been pretty lucky recently with the clothing i've purchased. i just bought two pairs of jeans off of amazon, and they're so comfortable and fit beautifully.\n  ","411773":"\n  i try to purchase items on sale all the time, but sometimes the items i need aren't on sale that week, or they're sold out so i have to resort to an alternative. in those cases, i'll pay full price for the item because it's absolutely necessary.\n  ","411774":"\n  i think the past may be difficult to forgive because there isn't anything we can do to change it. we may wish that things were different, but nevertheless, the past is concrete and the most we can do is accept the past and move on in spite of it. some people have problems forgiving their past because they still feel regret over what they said or did.\n  ","411775":"\n  i don't believe in god because there isn't any scientific evidence to prove that god actually exists. all religions are based upon a matter of faith -- having faith that something or someone exists, regardless of the lack of or abundance of evidence that says otherwise.\n  \n  i've never believed in god, even as a child (from what i can remember). i was raised in a religious household and attended religion classes, but after i was confirmed, i basically told my parents i didn't believe in god and wanted nothing to do with the church anymore.\n  ","411776":"\n  i don't believe in the afterlife, no.\n  ","411777":"\n  my friday was stressful, but overall good. i went through the last little bit of training that i had to do with the former administrator of the magazine program (she left on maternity leave yesterday, so they elected me to take over the program). then after work, i ran some errands and came home and had a large cup of iced coffee.\n  \n  the rest of the evening wasn't too terrible -- i mainly relaxed, watched television, and caught up on some of the questions in my inbox. i went to bed around 11:30pm or so.\n  ","411778":"\n  i took this photo with my DSLR a few years ago. it's probably one of my favorite photos to date.\n  ","411779":"\n  i haven't made any appointments, so no. i want my arms to heal from skin-picking completely before i make any more appointments.\n  ","411780":"\n  i don't know anything about him other than the fact that he has a makeup line. i own like two or three of his lipsticks.\n  ","411781":"\n  my

change people's points of view, unfortunately. the most you can do is sit them down and point out that their way of thinking is inherently wrong and hurtful, and it's ultimately up to them to take that into consideration and do critical thinking about their own thoughts and feelings.\n  \n  a lot of racism is rooted in family values, so when someone grows up in a racist home, they will likely grow up to be racist just like their family. it takes effort and freedom of thought for these people to understand that the way they were raised was wrong.\n  ","411790":"\n  my friends aren't racist, no. if they were racist, then i wouldn't be friends with them.\n  \n  someone who is racist judges people negatively based on the fact that they're black, spanish, asian, native american, etc etc. they fall into false stereotypes and treat people of different races as inferior to them.\n  ","411791":"\n  yeah, but obviously it goes on a case-by-case basis. some people are capable of realizing their faults and can work towards bettering themselves and reversing negative or harmful thought patterns. other people, unfortunately, cannot -- or they're too proud to ever admit that their modality of thinking is wrong.\n  ","411792":"\n  my profile picture is just a photograph of me drinking a beer, lol. there isn't a story behind it at all.\n  ","411793":"\n  the last trip i took was out to the eastern end of long island. my boyfriend, his family, and i went out there to enjoy the breweries and the weather for a weekend. this happened quite a few months ago, though.\n  ","411794":"\n  -- relaxing with the first cup of coffee in the morning.\n  \n  -- talking to my boyfriend at night before we go to sleep.\n  \n  -- getting new tattoos.\n  \n  -- going out for lunch or dinner with a close friend.\n  \n  -- writing something that brings me joy.\n  \n  -- taking a photograph that i'm particularly proud of.\n  \n  -- playing video games with friends (especially ultimate chicken horse or fibbage).\n  \n  -- positive reinforcement.\n  \n  -- forehead kisses from my boyfriend.\n  ","411795":"\n  tomato mozzarella salad. :'))\n  ","411796":"\n  besides my promotion, i haven't really received any good news. everything else in my life has basically been a sh*tshow, lmao.\n  ","411797":"\n  one of my closest online friends lives there. :'))\n  ","411798":"\n  not really, no. i'm not ashamed of anything that i enjoy.\n  ","411799":"\n  i can already access the internet any time that i want, so that would be pretty meaningless to me. it's also nice to disconnect from the internet every once in a while.\n  ","411800":"\n  the internet has resulted in some of my closest friendships, so i think that's the most important contribution it has made towards my life.\n  ","411801":"\n  it's not the entire reason why i like that movie, but it does contribute to my positive feelings towards it.\n  ","411802":"\n  i'm not engaged, but my boyfriend and i have been together for nearly 10 years.\n  ","411803":"\n  my weekend only started an hour ago, lol.\n  \n  if you're talking about last weekend, though, then it was fine. i mainly cleaned, did laundry, and ran errands, though. i also worked in the mornings.\n  ","411804":"\n  the relationships you make with other people, as well as finding something you're genuinely passionate about.\n  ","411805":"\n  i played in an volleyball league through a catholic youth organization for one summer, lol.\n  \n  it would be hard to believe because i'm an athiest, and generally i hate playing sports. however, it was actually a lot of fun considering everyone on my team was a friend of mine.\n  ","411806":"\n  hello -- i'm all right, although i could be better. it's been an extremely long day, so i'm glad that i'm finally in pajamas and relaxing with some netflix.\n  ","411807":"\n  american psycho (2000), spirited away (2001), and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind (2004).\n  ","411808":"\n  the things that i want to rant about (and recently did privately to a friend, haha) are too personal to talk about on askfm. i keep my personal life fairly private, and i only really tell perhaps 2 or 3 people what's going on in my life. i also tend to push people away when i'm under stress because i feel guilty talking about certain things, and that's also a habit i need to break.\n  ","411809":"\n  nothing at all. i don't have an interest in owning a drone.\n  ","411810":"\n  perhaps around a 6 or 7, haha. i do what i need to get done throughout the day, and i would rather get all of my errands done at once instead of spanning them out over the course of a few days or a week. however, once i'm home, there's basically nothing anyone can do to get me out of my pajamas, especially considering i need significant time at the end of each day to unwind.\n  ","411811":"\n  busy, hectic, and stressful.\n  \n  that goes for both high school and college, actually. i was in advanced classes in high school, so i was constantly studying, as well as dealing with all of my personal issues that i was dealing with at the time. in addition, when i attended college, i also took on a full courseload while working 25+ hours per week, so i was always busy with writing papers, studying, or working.\n  ","411812":"\n  yes, this has happened to me on numerous occasions. lmao. thankfully, i've never had to go very far to get what i left behind, though.\n  \n  however, my boyfriend left his insulin at home once or twice and i had to drive it to his job for him because he was unable to leave work to grab it himself. that's probably one of the most important examples i can think of, lol.\n  ","411813":"\n  i try to keep it as organized as possible because it puts me in a better head space when my personal belongings are clean and in their place. sometimes it does get messy, but i usually try to do a small bit of cleaning every day, or at least every few days.\n  ","411814":"\n  i'm stressed beyond belief in every facet of my life, at the moment. i'm just so beyond done with myself and most people around me. this past week has been a week from hell.\n  ","411815":"\n  no. if i hated an app, then i wouldn't use it.\n  ","411816":"\n  it doesn't phase me, and i don't see it at all based on who i follow on twitter. if someone has a problem with nudity on their timeline, they can simply unfollow that person.\n  ","411817":"\n  i would have to wait for the weather to get nicer & daytime gets longer before i can run outside. by the time i get home from work, there's really only 30-45 minutes left before the sun starts setting.\n  ","411818":"\n  depends on what the thoughts are, as well as what context they're in -- whether you're thinking in a positive, negative, or neutral light. sometimes overthinking can be good in a sense because you're attacking a situation from all angles and coming to a logical conclusion. however, overthinking is generally bad when you're degrading yourself or other people and promoting negative thought patterns.\n  ","411819":"\n  not constantly, no. however, i am aware in a general sense because of the brushes with death i've experienced in the past.\n  ","411820":"\n  yeah, me and a few other users have been bombarded with questions related to p*dophilia over the past few weeks, it's been absolutely horrid and ridiculous.\n  ","411821":"\n  as always, it was regarding p*dophilia.\n  ","411822":"\n  i don't block anyone on askfm, actually. it's a waste of time because the blocking system is worthless, and if someone is bothering me, then i simply delete their messages.\n  ","411823":"\n  not so much lately, no. i've been communicating my feelings so that they're not constantly in my head, and it's better for my mental health when i express my feelings either verbally or in writing.\n  ","411824":"\n  no, it's basically one of my worst fears. standing in front of a crowd and doing anything makes me terribly anxious.\n  ","411825":"\n  when i was in high school, i was quiet and kept to myself mostly. i was an academic student, and i spent my free time doing art and listening to music. however, i was also extremely troubled as a high school student and was dealing with a lot of personal difficulties regarding mental illness. i only had a small circle of friends, and i only really ever saw them at school.\n  ","411826":"\n  in a way, yes -- however, similar to my last answer, i believe we should respect people until they give us a reason not to respect them anymore. this goes for elders too. i don't believe that we should respect our elders simply because they're older than us, though. respect goes much deeper than that.\n  ","411827":"\n  i believe in respecting people first and foremost until they give you a reason not to respect them anymore.\n  ","411828":"\n  no, i never have before.\n  ","411829":"\n  emotional stability. i'm a fuckin mess.\n  ","411830":"\n  askfm, facebook, and twitter.\n  ","411831":"\n  i try to keep my room as clean as possible because it helps a lot with my depression & anxiety -- a clean space leads to clear thoughts, and i personally feel a lot better mentally when my living areas are organized.\n  ","411832":"\n  neither -- i believe i'm a realist, more than anything. i'm not 100 percent positive, but i'm also not completely negative either. i try to look at situations from a realistic point of view & weigh out all of the options that could possibly happen so that i don't get blindsided.\n  ","411833":"\n  idk if it's a \"trend\" anymore or not, but i've always liked the look of slightly ripped jeans, lol. a few of my jeans have tears in them, and i prefer that look over regular jeans sometimes. i usually cuff the ankles and wear ankle boots.\n  ","411834":"\n  thanks for the follow. i don't follow people upon request though, sorry.\n  ","411835":"\n  i've experienced sleep paralysis on a few occasions, and it was honestly terrifying. i was sorta awake, but i couldn't move my body and i felt trapped. this was before i knew what sleep paralysis was, so i thought something was wrong with me.\n  \n  my boyfriend experiences night terrors on an almost nightly basis.\n  ","411836":"\n  i know that i have dreams, but i seldom remember my dreams. sometimes i'll remember them as soon as i wake up, but the memory disappears within 10 minutes or so. it also depends on how deep of a sleep i'm in and when i wake up during my sleep cycle.\n  \n  from what i remember, most of my dreams are rather surreal, but in the sense that they make sense while you're dreaming, but when you wake up they're absolutely ridiculous, lol.\n  ","411837":"\n  i always thought that the whole \"lizard people\" conspiracy theory was bizarre af, lmao. it makes absolutely no sense to me and it's difficult for me to believe that some people actually endorse that theory.\n  ","411838":"\n  it depends entirely on who the person is & my relationship to them, what they did to break or question my trust, and how many times they perhaps have done the same thing in the past. i can't really give an absolute answer to this question because it's circumstantial.\n  ","411839":"\n  intimacy is important to me, but i don't put a lot of emphasis on it at the same time. i like physical affection, i.e. holding hands, kissing, etc etc., and i think i would feel neglected if my partner wasn't physically affectionate at all. i also need verbal confirmations of love and affection as well.\n  ","411840":"\n  i watched the grudge when i was probably far too young to really see the movie, and it actually haunted me for months. i had nightmares of the horror character for weeks on end, and it was absolutely terrible.\n  ","411841":"\n  the best thing for me to do to alleviate a bad mood is to talk about my feelings with someone else and come to a general understanding of why i feel that way and decide on what to do in order to feel better. communication fosters healing, so i usually try to seek out private conversation with a close friend or my boyfriend when i'm not feeling so great mentally.\n  ","411842":"\n  back when i was a pre-teen and didn't know much better, i really enjoyed listening to eminem's music. however, as time progressed, i realized how truly terrible his lyrics were and how he was basically a misogynistic assh*le.\n  \n  i haven't heard anything from him in a really long time, unless it's happening without my knowledge. regardless, i have no interest in his music anymore.\n  ","411843":"\n  i've never gambled before in my life -- i've never even played lotto, lol. i never really saw the point in it because it seems like a waste of money imo.\n  ","411844":"\n  well you asked this yesterday, lol. my morning yesterday was absolutely terrible -- but this morning was rather good. i got to work early so that i could check my email and get my assignments in order before work actually started, and i was able to catch up on what i missed rather easily, so it was a pretty easy-going day.\n  \n  i'm currently relaxing at home, and when my boyfriend wakes up from a nap, i'll be heading over to his house since i haven't seen him since last week.\n  ","411845":"\n  i haven't watched the recent documentaries on michael jackson, but i wholeheartedly believe that his actions were wrong based on what i do know. the fact that he had children over for sleepovers and had them change in front of him, etc etc., is predatory behavior and makes me extremely uncomfortable.\n  ","411846":"\n  i don't wear sportswear brands, lol.\n  ","411847":"\n  the most irritating thing to me personally is when someone hovers and watches me while i work -- it really gets under my skin and i feel like they're just waiting for me to make a mistake, or they're otherwise judging me. it's too much pressure and i would rather be left alone to get my work done correctly.\n  ","411848":"\n  i'm strongly pro-choice and lgbtq+ rights. i'm also an advocate for mental health awareness and frequently talk about stigma and related disorders on my other social media accounts.\n  ","411849":"\n  i only got interested in music when i was a pre-teen, and at that point in time, my favorite musicians were linkin park, evanescence, eminem, avril lavigne, sum 41, green day, etc etc. then i started getting more into older alternative rock music, and i began listening to stone temple pilots, alice in chains, pearl jam, audioslave, soundgarden, and others.\n  \n  my taste today is basically the same, but a lot more diverse. i listen to the same alternative rock music from the 1990s and early 2000s, but i also like newer rock music, such as grandson. i also like poppier musicians, i.e. matt maeson and hozier. at the same time, i'm also really into hip hop (watsky and grieves, for example). when i'm writing, i additionally listen to classical soundtracks for video games.\n  ","411850":"\n  i believe the best cinema experience i've ever had was when i went to the midnight premiere of one of the harry potter movies back when i was a teenager !! everyone was there in cosplay, and the audience was so engaged when the actual movie was on. it was an experience in itself.\n  ","411851":"\n  i don't go out to eat very often, so i don't really have a favorite place. although there's a local sushi restaurant that's really good. i haven't been there in about a year, though.\n  ","411852":"\n  i enjoy watching ice hockey on occasion, but i wouldn't say i love it.\n  ","411853":"\n  i don't even own a bikini, haha.\n  ","411854":"\n  if you didn't care, then you wouldn't have bothered sending this message. lmao.\n  ","411855":"\n  i got my license when i was 19 years old, and my first car was a volkswagen cabrio.\n  ","411856":"\n  it's only about 10 minutes away, but it's a pain in the ass to get to.\n  ","411857":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","411858":"\n  most recent selfie.\n  ","411859":"\n  i use gmail and outlook.\n  ","411860":"\n  no, it wasn't because of my job -- i actually didn't go to work today because of something that happened in my life, so that's why i've been stressed. although going back to work tomorrow probably won't help since i've been stressed at work too, lol.\n  ","411861":"\n  i'd rather not explain it on askfm, it has a few personal details regarding my life that i don't talk about on here.\n  ","411862":"\n  i just woke up out of a sound sleep because of a nightmare, and now i can't fall back asleep. today has been stressful enough as it is, i just want to be at peace for a while.\n  ","411863":"\n  coffee, lol.\n  ","411864":"\n  i never felt compelled to watch shows like the walking dead or grey's anatomy, even though everyone i know loves them. i also was never able to get into the office.\n  ","411865":"\n  i don't do yoga, but i've thought about saving up my money to buy a cheap treadmill that i can use at home. that way, i don't have to deal with driving to the gym and possibly interacting with strangers.\n  \n  however, for now, going to the gym is the better option. it makes me feel better having someone else there with me too.\n  ","411866":"\n  i haven't been to the gym in quite a few months, but i'm planning on going back this week. my friend and i realized we have the same gym membership so we're going to start attending together.\n  ","411867":"\n  people compliment my hair the most, lately. when i first got it done back in december, i had random people in the office building coming up and telling me it looked great, lol.\n  ","411868":"\n  there really isn't a definitive means of magically becoming more mature. it happens through time and experience.\n  ","411869":"\n  i'm sorry that you're going through a rough patch. things haven't been so great for me either lately tbh.\n  \n  when i feel like giving up, i think about my support system and how grateful i am to have a small group of people who genuinely care about me. i think about the successes i've witnessed within myself already, and i remind myself that i've been through a lot of difficult times already and have nevertheless survived.\n  ","411870":"\n  no, giving someone the silent treatment is pretty immature. relationships, whether platonic or romantic, need open communication -- and ignoring a person when you're upset with them is only going to make matters worse, not better.\n  ","411871":"\n  i'm looking forward to seeing my boyfriend, either tonight or later on this week. i haven't seen him in about a week or so, and i miss him.\n  ","411872":"\n  recovering from self harm, and graduating from college.\n  ","411873":"\n  not really. i usually go to bed between 10pm and 1am, though.\n  ","411874":"\n  a handful -- i can't really put a number to it or anything. but i have a few people from askfm added to other social media, and i talk to some of them occasionally.\n  ","411875":"\n  no ?? i said it would make me vomit, lmao. that has nothing to do with thinking you're better or worse than someone else.\n  ","411876":"\n  \"go easy\" by matt maeson ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/NauXMcSDmJI\n

this is my old baby. \u2661 he died about a year or so ago, i've had two fish since him (who also both recently passed). however, i had him for almost two years which is pretty good for a betta fish.\n  ","411878":"\n  probably some sort of janitor service, like cleaning public bathrooms and stuff. i would vomit everywhere because people are absolutely disgusting when it comes to public bathrooms.\n  ","411879":"\n  the corpse bride & sweeney todd are my top two favorites.\n  ","411880":"\n  i haven't, actually. i only recently found out that there was a musical, lol. perhaps i'll watch it soon.\n  ","411881":"\n  on sunday, i finished up some freelance writing assignments for my job, moved some furniture around, cleaned and organized my room, helped cook dinner, and went to bed rather early.\n  ","411882":"\n  i write extremely well. all of my writing jobs have resulted in me being trusted with high levels of responsibility due to the fact that my writing is concise and flows well.\n  ","411883":"\n  my eyes are a greenish hazel.\n  ","411884":"\n  i don't eat candy, so no.\n  ","411885":"\n  i just got home from work and running errands, so i'm currently sitting in my backyard and smoking a cigarette.\n  ","411886":"\n  i've been in a relationship for almost 10 years now.\n  ","411887":"\n  i last watched heathers on netflix. it's one of those movies that i can watch over & over again, and it never gets old.\n  ","411888":"\n  chloe price from life is strange !!\n  ","411889":"\n  from my understanding, it's just a bunch of teenage girls lipsyncing songs and i have no interest in seeing that.\n  ","411890":"\n  lately i haven't been working out.\n  ","411891":"\n  this has nothing to do with debates, rofl.\n  \n  hypothetically speaking, i wouldn't enjoy having diabetes. although i would have a lot of support and teaching from my boyfriend, who's a type 1 diabetic.\n  ","411892":"\n  no, i have no desire to download tik tok.\n  ","411893":"\n  i'm watching the truman show. i love this movie.\n  ","411894":"\n  obviously they're misguided people.\n  ","411895":"\n  MY BOYFRIEND TOLD ME HE'S GOING TO START WATCHING GAME OF THRONES, YES I'M SO EXCITED.\n  ","411896":"\n  probably the fact that i enjoy drinking and smoking weed, lol. i present myself as a straightforward, reserved person IRL so it surprised my coworkers when i told them my vices.\n  ","411897":"\n  i was proud of myself for getting through last week without calling out of work or leaving early, especially considering how overwhelmed i was with learning new tasks in a short period of time. sometimes my anxiety gets the best of me and i panic, which causes me to not be able to focus on anything at all. however, despite being overwhelmed, i was able to control my anxiety for the most part and get through the day.\n  ","411898":"\n  i have to be in the mood for them. i also don't care so much about other people's opinions, if someone disagrees with me on something then i usually just accept it and move on.\n  ","411899":"\n  i really want an axolotl, but i know nothing about caring for them and i also have no clue where to even find one, rofl.\n  ","411900":"\n  i don't really put any effort into labeling my opinions these days.\n  ","411901":"\n  that's one step to lessening your imprint. not buying certain products and opting for better alternatives, such as vegan and cruelty free products.\n  ","411902":"\n  i don't generally hate mondays. i'm just not looking forward to tomorrow.\n  ","411903":"\n  it depends on the situation. because in that case, then most people would be seen as selfish since a lot of the things people do and buy negatively impact animals and the environment. but if you're taking the right steps to lessen your imprint, then that's not selfish at all.\n  ","411904":"\n  not really. i haven't been feeling the greatest mentally, and i'm worried that my job might overwhelm me this week.\n

to their own desires without any regard to how it may affect other people.\n  ","411908":"\n  it's a natural human emotion to feel sad when someone dies. you can try to rationalize it all you want, but that doesn't erase the impact it has on people.\n  ","411909":"\n  death brings about a whole host of emotions, and grieving is incredibly complicated. i'm sad for the person who passed who might not experience their children growing up, and i also feel sad for the family who have to handle the aftermath of losing someone close to them.\n  ","411910":"\n  linkin park, stone temple pilots,

and sociology.\n  \n  i've always disliked the math classes i've taken, especially calculus. statistics wasn't terrible, though.\n  ","411913":"\n  i'm not scottish, so i've never had it before.\n

-- people not using blinkers, cutting other people off, stopping completely at yellow lights, driving under the speed limit in the left lane, etc etc.\n  \n  otherwise, i also can't stand when people eat with their mouth open or make noises while they eat. i don't like when people try to talk over me either.\n  ","411916":"\n  i don't know much about my own personality considering it changes on a regular basis depending on who i'm around.\n  ","411917":"\n  it depends on how busy i am that day. i'm normally on & off on the weekends since i have free time, but i don't check askfm during the week until night time since i work throughout the day.\n  ","411918":"\n  my first job was a cashier at a drug store. i don't remember what i did with my first paycheck, though. it probably went to my

i'm not close to many people, so if one of my friends hurt me without really knowing that they did, i would let them know that their words\/actions were hurtful in a polite way and advise them not to do it again.\n  \n  it's kinda difficult to really determine whether something was done accidentally or on purpose, though. i have a small circle so i've never had any issues with my current friends, so i would hope that they wouldn't turn around and purposely hurt me.\n  ","411927":"\n  i usually have a large iced coffee in the morning, and then two cups of hot coffee when i get home from work.\n

everyone is judgmental to a certain degree, i believe. i try to remain unbiased until i know a person, though. it's difficult to break out of that habit of judging someone without knowing them, since

think western feminism, particularly this new wave of feminism that has emerged over the past few years, focuses on insignificant issues that doesn't implement real change in regards to women's rights. in addition, western feminism focuses solely on the issues that mainly affect white women instead of broadening their advocacy for other people of color, especially in war-torn and developing nations.\n  \n  i'm all for traditional feminism, and i respect the original individuals who advocated for feminism back in the 1960s and 1970s. but western feminism these days has largely been a joke and gives feminism overall a bad name.\n  ","411948":"\n  i planned on going to the women's protest march in new york city a few years ago, but something happened in my life that prevented me from

sent me this question, LOL. either way, i think it's silly. legislators should be focusing more on other means of reform regarding taxes, education, the prison system, etc etc., instead of worrying about people who wear saggy pants.\n  \n  the whole saggy pants trend originated in the prison system, where people would wear their pants low since belts were confiscated in the institution. since then, it's been associated with hip hop culture, although i'm not really sure where the transition occurred. i don't personally see the point in wearing pants that sag if you obviously own a belt, but

","411952":"\n  i believe most things fall under this category -- especially in terms of vices, i.e. drinking, drugs, gambling, etc etc. most things are fine to do in moderation, but when you feel

aquarium for a wine and beer tasting night, which was super fun (it's the second year we did this). there was also live music there, so we sat down and drank and listened to music while also looking

you could easily get involved in an issue with another driver if they're feeling road rage.\n  ","411994":"\n  it doesn't mean they lied, lol. if you're so concerned, then you should talk to them about this.\n  ","411995":"\n  there are ASMR videos on youtube.\n  ","411996":"\n  i don't think that someone would lie about something like that and then proceed to ignore you. i think what happened

videos that trigger an \"autonomous sensory meridian response\" (ASMR). sounds and images that trigger such a response gives you a tingling sensation that starts with your head and travels downward, and it's supposed to relax you.\n  ","411998":"\n  i don't know if we can -- if we're past the point of no return or not. regardless, we need to recycle more, use energy-efficient light bulbs, use

they want to reveal about themselves.\n  ","412007":"\n  i'm not sure if i want to have children or not. it's something i'm constantly going back and forth with, which is probably an indication that i *shouldn't* have children.\n  \n  i don't believe the world is overpopulated, and people in general are free to have as many children as they would like -- granted, of course, they provide their children with a loving and healthy environment. i also believe in the importance of adopting and fostering children because there are so many kids, especially teenagers, who are in the system and they also deserve loving homes.\n  ","412008":"\n  i was an academic student when i was younger, so i learned best through lectures, including physical representations of subjects such as powerpoint presentations. i learned best through both listening, reading, and writing, and i often copied over my own notes multiple times to better understand the material.\n  ","412009":"\n  i think the increase in the use of technology among children is detrimental to their development, and i'm not entirely sure but i also think there are studies conducted on this topic too which reached the same conclusion (don't quote me on that, though). i think limiting screen time is important because it teaches children from a young age to become dependent on technology, instead of doing things that encourage personal growth such as reading, playing outside, and practicing hobbies and sports.\n  ","412010":"\n  i believe that society in general is just more cognizant of mental health problems in general thanks to the decrease in stigma, as well as increase in mental health professionals and scientific studies pertaining to mental illnesses. in the past, people who exhibited mental illness symptoms were deemed \"crazy\" and were locked away at an institution, while today there are more options for treatment and a general understanding.\n  \n  a lot of the people i know IRL have some degree of mental illness due to how prevalent it is. not everyone, of course, but i would say most of the people i interact with have had experienced mental illness either first hand or through someone they also know.\n  ","412011":"\n  i think taxidermy is incredibly interesting !! as long as the animals died naturally and did not die for the sake of being hung in someone's house, at least. i don't know if i would hang them in my own house, but i definitely appreciate the skill it takes in preserving the animals and their general aesthetic.\n  ","412012":"\n  i'm very good at keeping secrets -- i don't spread around other people's business and i don't gossip, so generally secrets are safe with me. i know the importance of having someone you can trust and i want to ensure to my friends that they can trust me to keep their problems to myself.\n  ","412013":"\n  i would much rather be able to detect any lie i hear, just so that i know whether or not someone is bullsh*tting me. it would make life far easier, i believe, because then i would know who to keep around and who to stay away from.\n  ","412014":"\n  i googled \"least stressful jobs\" in response to this question & there were many jobs that came up that didn't seem least stressful at all, lol. one of them that i thought was amusing was pharmacy technician, which is a total lie because that job is actually very stressful depending on where you're working !!\n  \n  personally speaking, i would think something like a data entry clerk would be least stressful because you're not interacting with anyone else and the work seems rather mindless.\n  ","412015":"\n  i think it's a combination of both, haha. on the one hand, i wonder if they're okay and whether or not they're sick & then i wonder how they're actually feeling. on the other hand, i don't want to get sick myself, so i end up keeping my distance.\n  ","412016":"\n  i don't generally go to the movie theater, so there aren't any movies that i want to see. if there are, then i usually wait for them to come out on dvd or on some sort of streaming service (netflix, hulu, amazon prime, etc).\n  ","412017":"\n  i would spend the beginning of the time relaxing because it would be a nice change from the chaos of every day life, lol. but eventually i would have to hunt for food, build shelter, and eventually find a way off the island.\n  ","412018":"\n  no, i don't believe that at all. i think we sometimes think it happens because we have an unconscious idea of what the future might entail, and it plays out in our dreams. but i don't believe that our dreams predict the future like some sort of cosmic thing.\n  ","412019":"\n  i know i mentioned it on here once before, but i'm so sick of my psychiatrist not responding to me in a timely manner, and ultimately, making me skip days of my medication because she doesn't refill my prescriptions on time. last month, my anxiety medication was on back order & the pharmacy needed her permission to switch me to a different number of mgs, and i called my psychiatrist at least 4 times within 5 days before she put the authorization through. in that span of time, i ran out of medication and had a panic attack at work.\n  \n  after that got \"sorted out,\" here i am one month later and i need another refill on the same prescription. even though i only see my psychiatrist every 90 days, she only authorized a 30-day refill. last week, i called the pharmacy to refill the prescription, and the next day, i received a call that my psychiatrist did not authorize the refill. i called her office three times -- twice it went straight to voicemail, and the third time i spoke to someone, but not my psychiatrist. i explained to them that i needed a refill ASAP, but so far i haven't received any notification from my pharmacy. that was yesterday afternoon.\n  \n  if this script doesn't get refilled by tomorrow, i'm going to run out of medication AGAIN and deal with everything all over like i did last month. i'm so done with this doctor. after this gets sorted out, i'm calling the office and changing providers because this is ridiculous.\n  ","412020":"\n  it depends on the individual. obviously we should be mourning the loss of the person who passed away, but there will always be some people who act selfishly and are actually mourning their own personal loss as opposed to mourning the loss of another life.\n  ","412021":"\n  necessary medication, i.e. insulin. it's absolutely ridiculous how much money my boyfriend pays for his insulin every month when it's a medication that not only does he *need,* but he would also die without it.\n  ","412022":"\n  my favorite decade for music is probably 1990s alternative rock. bands like stone temple pilots, pearl jam, tool, soundgarden, nine inch nails, etc etc. STP was my all-time favorite band for an extremely long time, so naturally i was mortified when scott weiland passed away (as well as chris cornell from soundgarden, RIP).\n  \n  however, my taste in music is so vast that it's difficult to really narrow down my favorite songs or musicians throughout the past century. i listen to alternative rock, classic rock, metal, hip hop, r&b, blues, jazz, pop, classical music, etc etc. while linkin park and STP are probably two of my all-time favorite bands, it has more to do with the memories associated with them than anything else. their music has never defined my musical taste, if that makes sense.\n  ","412023":"\n  i'm not much of a risk-taker at all, but i *am* rather impulsive. i don't gamble or act on dares per say, but i do act spontaneously according to my mood at that very moment, which sometimes leads me to weird or destructive situations.\n  ","412024":"\n  i've only ever had two best friends, which includes my current best friend as well as my boyfriend. before i met them, there were other people in my life with whom i was close, but i don't really think i considered them to be my \"best friend.\"\n  \n  however, my favorite memories with them both have included going to concerts with them and going on vacations with them. my best friend and i used to see concerts when we were teenagers, and we saw linkin park together like 2-3 times. in addition, her wedding back in 2017 was absolutely beautiful, and everyone had an amazing time.\n  ","412025":"\n  neither. i don't believe i'm a very fun person to be around, and i'm definitely not immature, haha.\n  ","412026":"\n  yeah, when i was a teenager i tried learning how to play the guitar and the keyboard. i was dedicated to trying to learn those new skills for a long time, but it just never stuck with me. i haven't played either instrument in probably 10 years.\n  ","412027":"\n  it depends on the reason why he's ill -- is he mentally unwell, or does he have some sort of physical affliction that can be treated ?? i would treat him according to what his symptoms are, so i would probably go to the drug store and purchase OTC medication. and if his illnesses were more severe, then we would see his doctor and get prescription medication as well.\n  ","412028":"\n  neither. i don't really keep up to date with the news much anymore because it was always mentally exhausting for me to try to remain current with what's going on in the world. however, just because i don't pay much attention anymore doesn't mean that i think it's \"fake news\" either.\n  ","412029":"\n  thankfully, i haven't had a nightmare in a very long time !! although i don't remember my dreams, so at least i don't recall having a nightmare, lol.\n  \n  i think there are a lot of people who do remember most of their dreams, but i just happen to be in the fraction of people who don't remember nearly any of them.\n  ","412030":"\n  i listen to the radio every time i'm driving to and from work, so perhaps around 1.5-2 hours per day. there's a local \"alternative rock\" radio station that just started up about a year ago that has some really great music, so i've been listening to that.\n  ","412031":"\n  probably my laptop tbh. it has a lot of photos and documents on it, and i would be devastated if i lost everything.\n  "}}
