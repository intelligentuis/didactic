  not everyone has good relationships with their families, so family isn't *always* the first priority. it isn't unreasonable to be upset when your significant other bails on you to spend time with their family, which is why i said they should divide their time equally between their partner and their family.

  i honestly don't remember, i had a few weird tinder stories too but it was in the spring, so i don't recall much of them at this point. i'm like 90% sure it was the facebook guy, though. i remember asking him how he ""triggers"" his mania, and he basically said, ""i close my eyes and focus really hard and i can bring on mania.""
  
  i was like, ""uh... i don't think that's how that works."" lmao. he was super weird, though. he'd constantly send me photos of his cat and was very ""woe-is-me,"" which is just irritating to me.

  ","
  oh yes -- my roommate was dating a woman for a few years, and she was very jealous of all of his friends who spent time with him, especially other women. she felt threatened by them because she had low self esteem, even though my roommate is the nicest and most loyal person ever. she would talk sh*t about us, our entire friend group, all the time, and we barely saw my roommate during the time they were dating. she pretty much wouldn't let him go out and see us because she was jealous, and when she would come with him to see us, she never spoke and had a gross attitude.
  
  i didn't personally do anything, but eventually my roommate did break up with her because he finally had enough and listened to us when we told him that he deserved better.

  honestly, the people who understand these struggles the most are those who are my age and younger because we are the ones who have had to work in long term retail environments and deal with the public on an average basis. there are some older people who understand as well, but i found that most of the complaints came from middle aged to elderly customers.

  each person requires something different, but what's important is to make sure they're aware that you're there for them & they can always come to you if they need to vent, cry, etc etc. they're not alone in their feelings and you want to make yourself available to them should they need extra help.

   Does money matter to you when you're deciding on dating someone? if yes, to what extent
  ","
  it matters to a certain extent, although it isn't so much money itself as it is that person having the drive to be financially independent (if that makes sense).
  
  i'm at a stage of my life where i'd potentially want someone who is financially independent, has a job, and is basically working towards supporting themselves. if a person has no motivation to find a job and support themselves at my age, then that isn't something i'm interested in.

   Why cant you get those any other day? Why does it have to be “for christmas” specifically? Christmas has become just a capitalist consumerist symbol for the brainwashed to spend their money. It lost its true meaning decaaaades ago.
  ","

  that isn't a good therapist if they insist that you should continue seeing them against your own wishes. in that case, i'd honestly be stern with them and tell them flat out ""our sessions are done. i'm seeking someone else,"" and then don't return.
  
  likewise, if they're employed through an agency like a counseling center instead of privately, you can also call the agency and tell them you'd like to stop seeing that therapist.

  i understand this feeling all too well — it's normal to not feel depression as heavily when you're busy with something (such as work), because it keeps your mind distracted. when you have nothing to distract yourself with, that can be when the heaviness sets in. that's why i try to keep myself busy 24/7, tbh.

  just because i don't own a gun doesn't mean i oppose guns. i do believe there should be *much* stricter gun laws in the united states, but i'm also of the belief that civilians have the right to own a gun as well.
  "
382637,"
   Yeah. It must be quite a scary experience. But you New Yorkers must be quite used to storms. There is always a few days in winter that you get a lot of snow hahaha
  ","
  where i live, the towns/counties are never prepared enough for storms, which makes it dangerous to drive. if i lived upstate, it would probably be a different story because they expect the storms and can accommodate for them. but on long island, nobody has any idea what's going on so people go wild when there are storms, smh.

  ","
  some people aren't fortunate enough or able to sustain a job — just because you can and have a financial cushion doesn't mean it's wrong for other people to ask for help when they need it. in most cases, these people don't necessarily *want* to ask for help, but they have no other choice if they want to survive or provide for their families.

  unfortunately, xanax is a controlled narcotic so it *can* be addictive. i'm on such a low dose, however, that it doesn't affect me too badly if i don't take it as scheduled. there have been two or three times i've run out and started getting withdrawal symptoms, though.
  
  my other psychiatric medication that controls my depression and mood swings aren't addictive like that, and i'm not dependent on them at all. should i ever want to come off of medication, my psychiatrist and i would just slowly lower the dosage until i don't have to take it anymore.

  hey friends, my inbox is nearly empty so ask me some questions while my edible kicks in ~~
  "

   i am talking about allison
  ","
  why didn't you just tag her then? rofl.
  
  allison isn't old, though. when you get older, you'll have a different perception of what ""old"" and ""young"" is. i used to think people who are 40+ were old, but as i've gotten older, i've realized that 40 isn't old at all.

   your old friend thinks she’s better than everyone who’s young
  ","
  i'm not quite sure what this is referring to. can you be more specific?
  "
383192,"
   my point was that you are adding to the stereotypes with your “jokes”
  ","
  oh trust me, i understand, lol. i was just providing you with my thoughts (albeit not very helpful) on the matter.
  "
383193,"
   exactly, but why do “old” people get a free pass while the “young” are denigrated generation after generation?
  ","
  like i said, you've got me beat. i'm sure there's some sociological explanation behind it, but i'm not well versed in that discipline.
  "
383194,"
   why don’t you apologize for making a general comment about college students?
  ","
  well, then i apologize. i didn't realize my joke about young college kids was offensive.
  "
383195,"
   i was raised to be racist but i started to reject those ideas in college. someone in their 30’s/40’s can’t keep blaming how they were raised
  ","
  i'm just providing explanations, obviously not excuses. most of us were raised to act and behave in problematic ways, and it's ultimately up to us to unlearn those behaviors/thought processes and act mindfully.
  "
383196,"
   What product do you wish a company would make a “SMART” version of?
  ","
  i don't really have any smart appliances besides my phone and television, so i really have no idea, lol.
  "
383197,"
   What do you think makes someone a GREAT person? 🤔
  ","
  someone who goes out of their way for others without expecting anything in return, just to make that person feel safe, happy, and comfortable.
  "
383198,"
   but it is. all young people are lazy/trolls. migrants are taking the jobs of americans etc etc. the same things over and over and again. most college kids/young kids are trying to find their way, what excuse do people in their late 30’s/40’s have for being buttholes?
  ","
  i can't speak on behalf of people in their 30s and 40s, so you've got me beat. they're in my generation, but sometimes people who are older have more traditional views (one of my coworkers is an example of that, she's only 36 but has super traditional views regarding family).
  
  it really all depends on how a person has been raised, tbh. some people consider it to be acceptable while obviously others don't.
  "
383199,"
   What are some of the best feelings in life ??©
  ","
  waking up & having a cup of coffee outside on a chilly, yet reasonable day. feeling productive after a day of work. listening to new music that gets you in the groove. falling in love with a person with whom you have great chemistry.
  "
383200,"
   i’m 22 and I get harassed by old dude in the 30’s & 40’s more so than i do by “college kids” both on and off line. the same dudes who talk about how shitty the “young ones” of today are. but keep enforcing their tropes. they want you to
  ","
  harassment is wrong either way, regardless of a person's age. but from my experience as a former college kid in my early 20s, i was an as*hole (as were all of my friends) so the correlation simply made sense to me.
  
  either way — it was a joke, and obviously not all college kids act the same way. it isn't that deep.
  "
383201,"
   no, i sent the one after you blamed college kids
  ","
  well thank goodness, because i was gonna say, y'all have problems.
  "
383202,"

  you're the same anon who sent the message about the dead ex-wife? lmaoo. jesus christ dude, just stop.
  "
383203,"
   Which social media you liked then lost interest? Why? Would you reuse it?
  ","
  tumblr, haha. i used to use it regularly but then i just stopped using it because i realized how toxic the communities were.

  ","
  no, i think it's the complete opposite of that.
  "
383205,"
   Do you get tempted by Black Fridays deals online and offline?
  ","
  no, i don't even know of any black friday deals rn. i haven't looked at anything.
  "
383206,"
   i’m not “offended”. it’s convenient for adults to blame young kids/college kids when they are just as bad. its obvs a way of deflecting from the crap things they do, blame everyone else. the young ppl of today, hey?
  ","
  i agree with you in certain circumstances, but not in all. guaranteed the anon who was sending me those statements were just a young troll.
  "
383207,"
   Can you debate/discuss with someone without being bias?
  ","
  i believe i can, yes.
  "
383208,"
   Do you think we’re in need of a revolution?
  ","
  i think the revolution has already somewhat begun.
  "
383209,"
   there’s nothing wrong with judging, what if someone was wearing “i hate gays” on their t shirt?

  well that's a different story, rofl. i've never seen hate speech on a tee shirt before, though.

   Lyrics that resonate with you? 🎤
  ","
  ""whiskey was his friend, he didn't have another. vicodin his vice, his real and only lover. smoked a pack or two, it never was a problem. popped a pill or two, they really made him blossom.""
  
  -- ""everybody gets high"" by missio.
  "
383211,"
   Which part of a conflict do you believe is more important - the journey to solution or the solution itself?
  ","
  the journey to the solution is the most important, because it's during that journey where you learn about yourself and others.
  "
383212,"
   What about in real life?
  ","
  everyone does judge to an extent, but i've tried making over the years the conscious decision to re-think those judgments and remind myself that i simply don't know that person's life or what they've been through.
  "
383213,"
   On what topic do you and your parents most disagree?
  ","
  how my brother and i were raised. i've never vocalized my feelings about my childhood toward my parents, but my mother always insists that she was the best mother ever (even though she ab*sed me).
  "
383214,"
   Are you a ""food snob"" in anyway? For example, are there certain foods that you will only eat if it's prepared in a specific way or if it's made by a specific brand?
  ","
  the only way i'm a food snob is that i prefer velvetta mac n' cheese over kraft, lmaoo.
  "
383215,"
   What did you buy in the Black Friday sales?

  i haven't purchased anything yet. i'll probably go on my laptop tomorrow and look at some deals through the weekend, my eyes hurt too much rn.

  listening to early 2000s emo rock and pop punk music.

   Would you rather be a lonely genius, or a sociable idiot?
  ","
  i'd rather be a lonely genius. i'm already alone 99% of the time anyway.
  "
383220,"
   Is a life exclusive to pleasure (no suffering) worthwhile?
  ","
  we cannot know happiness or pleasure without suffering to some extent. we can't acknowledge our happiness or understand that happiness unless we've experienced suffering and struggles that can define that happiness for what it is.
  "
383221,"
   Are you a leader or a follower?
  ","
  depends on my mood, because i've done both.
  "
383222,"

  "
383224,"
   Do you think time is going by fast or slow? How’s about 2020?
  ","
  this year has been simultaneously fast & slow, if that makes any sense. the beginning of the year felt like so long ago, yet the past month has flown by so fast. it's hard to believe that next week is december already.
  "
383225,"
   If you like a girl/guy, what do you do to win her/him?
  ","
  people aren't prizes to be won, lol. if i end up liking someone, i'll talk to them and see if there's any chemistry. if not, then i move on.
  "
383226,"
   It's a compliment pointless.??
Alright

  happy belated thanksgiving to you as well ~~
  "
383235,"
   Do you think the weather affects your mood at all? If so, how?
  ","
  it definitely does — i tend to get more solemn and mildly depressed during the winter months when it gets darker earlier in the day. i enjoy the rain & it makes me content, but i also don't tend to feel well on days that are just dark and cloudy.
  "
383236,"
   Tell a joke you feel bad for finding funny.
  ","
  pretty much all of the jokes in both borat movies, lmao. they're so offensive and cringey, but they make me laugh so hard.

  idk, my parents probably sold it at a garage sale.

  ","
  yeah, there was a neighbor who lived next to my parents (he still lives there but mostly lives in another state now) and he was such a grouchy old man, lol.
  "
383246,"
   You think that it's a bad thing to tell someone: You're sexy? Lol
  ","
  if it's not prompted or expected and makes that person feel uncomfortable, especially if they're a stranger, then yes.
  "
383247,"
   Are there any rappers you feel like don’t get enough respect?

  idk, i just listen to music without really analyzing whether or not they're respected or popular (unless they've done something terrible that i become aware of).

   How do you behave when among new people? Do you try to find a common ground with them or do you keep your distance trying to figure out if these people are your type and only then start a conversation?

  i prefer keeping anonymous questions enabled because that's the large majority of where my questions come from.

  ","
  i mean, your sister is a grown adult, and as harmful as her decisions are, telling your mother to talk to her will probably result in an unfavorable outcome because of the fact that your sister is an adult. try talking to your sister yourself and saying you're concerned about not only the baby's health, but her health as well. smoking and drinking is extremely harmful to fetuses.

  uh, the idea that you're ""dealing with"" someone who struggles with bipolar disorder sounds a bit arrogant and ableist, not gonna lie. people with bipolar disorder aren't burdens, they require understanding.
  
  even still, everyone is different — a person is more than just their illness, and it's up to you to talk to them about how you can help with if they're experiencing an episode.

   Is it a valid reason to break up with someone if they don’t want to marry you? I’ve been in a relationship for almost 3 years and he says he never wants to marry me because it’s easier to end things if he cheated?? He said it as a joke
  ","
  what the f*ck — that's a really horrible ""joke"" and that was so rude a disrespectful for him to even say that in the first place.
  
  on another note, it is valid to break up with someone if you're even questioning it to begin with. everyone has their different goals and desires, and if you see marriage in your future and he doesn't, then that's going to cause problems later on when you definitely want to settle down. marriage is one of those things where both people would want to do it, otherwise it's one-sided.

   LEIGH, Its been awhile since ive asked for advice but things are dire. My gf is attractive and fun to be around sometimes but its like only 40% of the time, the other 60% shes bipolar and mentally ill. There is seriously nothing i can do when she goes darkside on me and can happen any second. Help?
  ","
  considering i've been on the opposite end of this, as the person struggling with mental illness, i can assume that your girlfriend is likely aware of this and feels bad about it already, and she's probably unsure of what to do herself.
  
  if you haven't tried already, have an open discussion with her about these feelings and see if you two can create a plan for when she's in a bad place, i.e. doing things for her that may make her life easier while she's in an episode or just being there for her and caring when she needs it most.
  
  also, if she isn't already doing this, suggest therapy/medication (if that's something she's able to do). the combination of having medication and going to therapy does wonders for a lot of people with mental illness, especially bipolar disorder.

  i can agree with this, yes. as you take on more responsibilities, you start to realize what's genuinely important in your life versus what is a bit insignificant in the long run, and you have to adjust accordingly.

   Is sex about constantly pushing the boundaries or playing by the rules?
  ","
  depends on your personal views toward sex. some people like pushing the boundaries & experimenting, while others play it simple.
  "
383545,"
   Is it really necessary to know everything from your partner’s previous relationships?
  ","
  no, it isn't necessary. most people, in my experience, don't feel the need to share every detail about their past relationships. it doesn't affect the current relationship.
  "
383546,"
   Will you say sorry to your partner even though it’s not your fault?
  ","
  if something isn't my fault, then there's no sense in me apologizing. i used to do that a lot when i was younger — i would apologize even when something wasn't my fault just to end the argument — but currently, i'm not willing to do that anymore.

  ","
  honesty. i expect my friends to be honest with me, whether it's something they're going through and they feel comfortable enough to speak to me about it, or they feel that i did something wrong or i'm being problematic. friendships where you can't be honest with each other are normally very superficial.

   what type of adult did you want to be, when you were a child and watching the adults around you
  ","
  i wanted to be the complete opposite from them. i can't remember my actual childhood, but i do remember most of my teenage years, and the adults in my life (mainly family members) were manipulative, ab*sive, and just overall very toxic people. one of my worst fears is that i would turn into my mother, and i still carry that fear to this day.
  "

   How should relationship problems be solved? 💔
  ","
  through honesty and communication -- those are the foundations of any relationship, and if you can't communicate effectively with your partner, then the relationship likely won't last. both partners also should keep an open mind when it comes to discussing problems in the relationship and place themselves in the other person's shoes, to see from their perspective.

   It's a huge theory. Most of the men look similar, he thought he killed someone who was never armed and alive at the end, the bodies disappeared. There YouTube vids on it and until I seen them, I thought things were a little off but didn't even consider that to be a possibility! 😯😂

  i haven't watched the movie in such a long time ever since they took it off of netflix here, but i've debated on buying the movie because i love it so much. it's strange to say, but it's one of my comfort films, ahah.
  
  the next time i watch, i'll have to keep a close eye on those things and see.

  "
383565,"
   is 18-25 a big age gap?
  ","
  i would consider that to be a big age gap, yeah. even though you're legally an adult at the age of 18, you're still very much a teenager and just graduating from high school. someone who's 25, on the other hand, is an established adult who in some cases has already graduated from college with a career.
  
  it comes down to where each person is in their life, and generally 18 versus 25, those two people are in very different stages.

   Would you ratherhear a 🤍comforting lie or an 🖤 uncomfortable truth?
  ","
  i would rather hear an uncomfortable truth. most lies eventually are revealed in the long run, and i would much rather hear the truth now as opposed to finding out later, especially if it's through someone else.
  "
383570,"
   if someone keeps throwing indirectly insults at you, deliberately saying things to attack you, but not directly, is that passive-aggressive behaviur?
  ","
  i think that would be passive aggressive, yeah, because they're not saying it directly to you. for example, if a person was insulting you to someone else with the intent that you will eventually hear/see it, then that is very passive aggressive.
  "
383571,"

   What do you think happens after death, if anything? ☠

  i believe our physical body perishes, but our souls/spirits (whatever you want to call it) are transferred to another medium into the universe. our spirits are composed of energy, and as energy cannot be destroyed, it must be transferred and embody something else.
  "
383573,"
   Would you rather be passive aggressive or just straight up aggressive

   not the same anon, but what's the difference between dysmorphia and dysphoria?
  ","
  there's body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria, from my understanding. gender dysphoria is the distressed feeling that trans people feel because their gender doesn't match their assigned gender at birth.
  
  body dysmorphia is when a person (regardless of their gender) is hyperfixated on a perceived problem or insecurity with their own body, which kinda ties into gender dysphoria.

383618,"
   what’s your opinion on the “we are the virus”/humans are bad narrative?
  ","
  the whole ""we are the virus"" thing is a bit misleading, in my opinion, and can be a dangerous thought process. i remember the memes going around a few months ago that pushed that narrative because ""nature was healing"" as a result of humans staying inside and quarantining because of COVID.
  
  but, the ""we are the virus"" takes away from the notion that millions of people have d*ed, especially in underserved communities, and we're still very much a part of nature and the ecosystem in itself. humans aren't inherently bad, and it's mainly major corporations and government entities that are inflicting harm upon the earth.
  
  a lot of people push the idea, when they say ""we are the virus,"" that we're almost *deserving* of a new plague, so to speak, and i think that's honestly terrible.

  i know what you're going through because the same thing happened between me and my ex (except he was the one whose feelings dwindled, not me). it's better to be upfront and honest about how you're feeling instead of faking sentiments, like you just said. it may hurt them, of course, but it would be doing a disservice to yourself and to your partner if you continued to pretend you're still in love with them. you both will become very unhappy.

  most of the time, bullies don't have self-confidence and are simply taking their own frustrations and insecurities out on other people — by giving them a ""taste of their own medicine,"" you're placing yourself in the same position as a bully, which is going to lead that bully to further harrass other people.
  
  there isn't such a thing as bullying people until they become humble. that's why you need to approach them with patience and maturity while educating them that their behavior is completely wrong & dangerous. and if they continue, then block/report their messages so they won't bother you further.

  like a few people have said before me, this is a potentially dangerous question that can lead to an exacerbation of symptoms in people who already struggle with dissociation, psychosis, paranoia, etc etc. i understand your intentions are good, but you also have to recognize your audience because many of the people you've sent this question to have mental illnesses and have difficulties perceiving reality.

   What's your opinion on self diagnosing; are you for or against it?
  ","
  mostly against — there's a big difference between suspecting you have an illness and claiming you do have that illness, though. it's extremely healthy and normal for people to have their suspicions that they *may* be struggling with a disorder (such as mental disorders), but then it becomes a bit problematic when that same person automatically tells others that they have that disorder without consulting a medical professional first.
  
  there's a reason why doctors go through years upon years of schooling and medical training — it's all about the cross-examination of symptoms because symptoms of numerous disorders can overlap, and it isn't the responsibility of the layperson to make that determination themselves.
  
  this is most prevalent in mental health communities online, i've noticed, where people think they have a disorder and just roll with it instead of considering outside possibilities. i understand that not everyone has access to medical care, but you can say that you suspect you have a disorder without downright claiming that you have that disorder 100%.

   i've been in therapy ever since i was 7. 1−2 sessions/week. my rule of thumb is that, unless something is REALLY wrong, i will wait through 3−4 sessions to see if my therapist is a right fit for me. if i'm still hesitant, i'll usually take that as my cue to find someone else. (1/2)
  ","
  (cont) ... another really big telltale is whether or not you've opened up at all. therapists are trained to help you feel comfortable to do this sooner or later. if i still feel like i'm in the ""breaking the ice"" stage, that's usually an in-my-face sign that this therapist isn't the right fit.
  
  --
  
  this this this this. thank you for putting it in words more eloquently than i ever could have at the moment, lol.
  
  you're definitely right about waiting the 3-4 sessions thing -- i did that with my previous therapists before deciding they weren't the right fit for me, because it's difficult to really determine if you fit well with a therapist on the first meeting alone, unless something is very wrong, like you said, or something makes me feel super uncomfortable.
  
  this is all good advice to heed, so i hope my other anon sees this.

  ","
  unless a person is writing in a formal context, such as for a job or for school, it doesn't really matter whether or not someone is grammatically correct. it's just the internet (and this is coming from someone who proofreads, writes, and copyedits written works for a living).
  "
383887,"
   What’s the meanest thing someone has ever said to you? 🤬

  light a few candles and either read or go on my phone until the power came back on.

  well i haven't written a book yet. most of my writing currently is creative non-fiction.

  i had one previous boyfriend and one previous girlfriend.

  there was a proper end. we broke up in august of 2019.
  "
383898,"
   How long do you want to be singe for?

  this isn't exactly something i can predict. i'm just going with the flow and living each day as they come.

383899,"
   When were you last properly single?
  ","
  besides now, it was 10 years ago.
  "
383900,"
   That is good.  You just knwe it wasn't going to work?
  ","
  in retrospect, i knew towards the end that it was ending, i just didn't know when until we both sat down and talked about it. i was a bit in denial about it because i was still so much in love with him, but his feelings weren't reciprocated anymore and i could tell just by the way he acted towards me within the last 6 months or so of the relationship.
  "
383901,"
   You not ready for another relationship yet?
  ","
  nah, i have no interest in relationships right now. i'm content with being single.
  "
383902,"
   Are you dating again
  ","
  no, i have no interest in dating at the moment.
  "
383903,"
   Do you think the 2 of you just became over familiar?
  ","
  no, that wasn't the reason for the breakup. we're still close friends even post-break up because we ended amicably.
  "
383904,"
   What is your favorite color?
  ","
  depends on my mood, usually dark red or purple though.
  "
383905,"
   How long did you live together?
  ","
  we didn't live together, at least not formally. there were a few years where i pretty much ""lived"" at his house casually and went home every few days to pack new clothing and bring it to his house, though.
  "
383906,"
   That’s good though at least You know the cats miss you lol
  ","
  i don't understand how they can miss me -- i'm home 24/7 and always leave my door open at night so they can come & go as they please, rofl.
  "
383907,"
   are schools closed?
  ","
  not completely no, at least not yet. there are so many school districts that have been closing temporarily because kids and faculty are getting sick, though.
  "
383908,"
   So how many?
  ","
  i'm not entertaining this because it sounds like a fetish considering how often it's asked to me and other people.

383909,"

  9 years.

  "
383913,"
   do you like scented candles? if so, what are your favs? 🕯️
  ","
  yes, i love scented candles !! i have a few from bath & body works which are amazing, like fresh balsam and one just called ""winter"" (not sure what the actual scent is). i also like jasmine, cinnamon and vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli, and peppermint.
  "
383914,"
   Something worth reading!!
  ","
  ""daily reminder that calls to forgive abusers, be the bigger person, set a positive example for people who have unapologetically hurt you, and bear the burden of reconciliation singlehandedly are all tactics of perpetuating said abuse. don't fall for it. seek justice.""

383915,"
   What did you have for lunch
  ","
  i haven't had lunch yet, it's only 7:30am.
  "
383916,"
   What life lesson did you learn the hard way?
  ","
  don't put effort into others if they won't reciprocate the same level of effort into you (i'm mostly talking in a friendship context, but the same goes for relationships).
  "
383917,"
   Physical pain like what?
  ","
  my back and neck hurt 24/7 as it is, and i wouldn't call any of my pain ""chronic pain"" because i feel like that takes away from people who *do* experience chronic pain to the point where it's disabling. i also feel like i'm developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  "
383918,"
   If you had to teach something what would you teach?
  ","
  i suppose creative writing, since i know the most about it, especially with respect to expressing yourself honestly.

  any sort of compliment on my writing is among the best compliments i've received.
  "
383920,"
   Is there a song that always makes you happy?
  ","
  not necessarily happy, but calmed and tranquil. i like listening to instrumental music from the lord of the rings movies and the skyrim soundtrack, because they put me at ease.
  "
383921,"
   oof, this one hurts so much. I'm sorry you went through that
  ","
  thank you -- it hurt a lot at the time obviously, but looking back on it, i've come to terms with it and i'm grateful that he was at least honest with me about his feelings instead of beating around the bush or making bullsh*t excuses.
  
  i mean ... he probably could have worded it a bit better, but he's also always been a very upfront sort of person, so it makes sense coming from him. he didn't mean it in a malicious way, but obviously it still broke me.
  "
383922,"
   Did your parents use timeouts or spankings?
  ","
  i don't remember much of my childhood besides the random flashbacks i've been experiencing lately, and they're not good memories.
  "
383923,"
   What's a phrase you wish you could NEVER hear again?
  ","
  ""i don't love you as much as you love me.""
  "
383924,"
   What would you do differently from your parents when raising up your children?
  ","
  i don't have children, and i don't think i even want children in the future (which works well for me, considering i think i'm infertile anyway).
  "
383925,"
   Would you rather be in constant pain or have a constant itch?
  ","
  i suppose constant pain, because i'm used to experiencing physical pain and i could probably adjust to it for the most part after experiencing it for a long time.
  
  itching, on the other hand, drives me up the wall.
  "
383926,"

  i don't have one, i think pickup lines are silly.

383928,"
   What have you done today to make your place in this crowded world?
  ","
  well, technically this wasn't today considering it's only 7:00am and i've only been awake for about an hour. but last night, i talked to my coworker via video chat on zoom, and it cheered her up a lot. she's been going through an extremely difficult time and it felt nice to see her laughing and smiling.
  "
383929,"
   What gets you excited about life?
  ","
  seeing my friends, whether that's virtually or in-person. i had a great zoom video session last night with one of my coworkers whom i haven't seen since march.
  "
383930,"
   I’m the opposite, any little wind and I get sick
  ","
  ah, i understand. i don't get sick or anything and i would much rather be cold than hot.
  
  for instance, i just got home from taking a quick dunkin trip and i wore a light hoodie & flip flops, rofl. it's only 38 degrees fahrenheit outside.
  "
383931,"
   Do you prefer to be overdressed and a bit sweaty or underdressed and a bit on the cold side?

  under dressed & cold.

  uh, i think you hit send before you completed the question. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  "
383933,"
   What's something that you've struggled with this year?

  hypomanic episodes and flashbacks, at least in the past 2-3 months. they've never been this bad before.

   Hey, Leigh. I hope it doesn't sound weird, but you somehow inspired me to follow a routine about my sleep. Now I wake up early every day and it feels so good, ahaaa, I got time for activities and I also feel good. When my sleeping schedule was chaotic, I felt unproductive and bad.
  ","
  aw, i'm happy to hear that !! once i switched over to a routine sleep schedule, i began feeling so much better throughout the day. even when i don't *have* to wake up early in the morning, i do so anyway just to get more out of the day, and it makes me feel more optimistic and more productive.

  honestly, it blew my mind when i found out that some people don't have that ""inner voice,"" lol. i thought it happened to everybody.
  "
383961,"
   How do you think? Do you think in words by hearing an inner voice? Do you think in colors? Describe the way in which you think!
  ","
  when i think to myself, i hear a distinct voice relaying those thoughts to me that's just above my subconscious. i don't necessarily think in colors or anything, but sometimes symbols do play a role.

   How much does the lyrics of a song matter to you? How good would you say you are at memorizing lyrics from songs you've listened to? 🎤🎶
  ","
  lyrics are somewhat important to me, but it really does depend on the song. i appreciate great lyricism, but at the same time, i also love instrumentals that also compose of a song, so if the lyrics are lacking and the instrumentals are great, then that's fine.
  
  i'm fairly good at memorizing lyrics, haha.

  LOL, well i'm not drunk -- im tipsy at best, and i had already completed 3 of the assignments prior to posting that video. i only had to proofread/copyedit 10 press releases this weekend, so it isn't as much brain-power compared to if i had to write them myself. i just had to make sure the grammar was fine and information was consistent.
  
  anyway, yay i'm done now & that's extra money in my pocket. :')) only took me maybe 90 minutes in total.
  "
383968,"
   Do you have to finish it tonight?

   It’s such a complicated situation... Half of students in multiple cities know LESS math than they did a year ago. & guess who's hurt the most? It’s not rich white kids. Unfortunately Latino and Black students lagged FAR behind their white peers. I wish I knew the answers!
  ","
  2020 has definitely had a lot of setbacks education-wise, particularly for children whose families don't have the resources or time to dedicate toward providing them an education that they would normally receive in in-person schooling. the more a child goes without continuous education, the less they're going to comprehend (sorta like when we had summer breaks in school, we forgot half of what we learned the previous year since we weren't actively practicing it).
  
  in underserved communities, this is definitely more prevalent. rich white children obviously have the benefit of having more resources to attain adequate education during this COVID year, such as home schooling and whatnot. this can't be said for a large majority of people, though.
  "
383971,"
   What is your idea of escapism?
  ","
  i normally escape through music, alcohol, marijuana, television shows/movies, and video games.

383972,"
   Do you think remote learning is an okay replacement to in person school for small children/elementary aged children?
  ","
  i'm not well-versed in child behavior or what may work best for children at that age in regards to schooling, so in a general sense, i honestly don't know. however, given the current climate of 2020, it's much safer for children to engage in remote learning than in-person learning for the safety of everyone involved -- children, faculty, family members, friends, etc etc.

   Don’t you miss being in a relationship?

  i don't think so, personally. it's always a plus if you have the same taste of music/movies as your partner, but i don't think it's really a make-or-break type of situation.
  
  also -- there are so many types of movies and television shows out there, it would be difficult for a couple to not agree on a single thing. chances are, there is a few shows or movies that both people enjoy, even if it isn't in line with what they generally like.

  i've sorta done it before, yes. when i went on a cruise last february, there was very little service since we were on the water most of the time, so i didn't use the internet for several days at a time (the cruises was 7-8 days long in total).
  
  it felt nice to disconnect and just live in that moment.

383983,"
   Most embarassing thing you've done when drunk?
  ","
  ah, probably falling asleep in the bathroom at the bar when i got way too drunk on one of my birthdays. :/
  
  it was a one-person bathroom where you could lock the door behind you, so after i used the toilet, i sat against the wall to gather my bearings and ended up drifting off to sleep just sitting there. i woke up (idk how long it even was) to the sounds of my friends banging on the bathroom door and calling out my name. lmao.
  "
383984,"

  "
383987,"
   Why are people totally different in person than they are on social media?
  ","
  it could be for a variety of reasons. some people are simply more comfortable expressing themselves online via text as opposed to in person, and more of their personality comes out online via social media compared to IRL.
  
  it isn't necessarily a bad thing. you are who you are regardless of whether your presence is online or IRL, and there's honestly more freedom of expression on the internet, which prompts others to be more expressive and honest with themselves.

  i can't really compare it to being trans because i've never felt 100% a woman or a man, but non-binary has always suited me best because of that reason. it is a bit of a pain, though, because while i present as feminine, people assume i'm cis and call me feminine descriptors/pronouns even after i've corrected them.

  i wouldn't go so far as to consider it a red flag, because every situation is different. however, ideally a person should leverage their family obligations with their relationship equally, and understand that there is a place and time for everything. if your family is important to you while you're in a relationship, you have to find a balance.

  ","
  i don't think i can give a definitive answer to this question, because it has to depend on a variety of factors -- what those opposites are, whether they complement each other or detract from one another, and how it affects the relationship as a whole.
  
  in certain times, i think it's healthy to be in a relationship with someone who may be somewhat opposite from you, because it can introduce new perspectives and make you see things in a different light -- but this might only work if both people are open to looking at new things. it can become a problem if either person in the relationship are too stubborn to look at things differently or try to understand from a different point of view.

  if you've already talked about this to him multiple times and he hasn't changed, then this seems like something he has to realize for himself. however, i would advise you to *not* apologize when things aren't your fault and stand your ground. perhaps that change of scenery might help him realize that he needs to take accountability.
  
  if this continues on and gets worse, though ... i would think hard about the integrity of the relationship as a whole and whether or not you want to continue with it. a person never apologizing for their wrong actions isn't really a good person to keep around (i'm saying this in general though, obviously i don't know the nature of your relationship).

  ","
  when you're paying for what you believe is high-end, quality cosmetics, you're primarily paying for the name brand itself. there are plenty of drug store makeup products that are just as high quality for much reasonable prices, and there's nothing wrong with people purchasing drug store makeup.
  
  nobody is ""cheap"" or most definitely a ""shame to society"" for being conscious about prices of items that are just as high quality as the other counterparts that are being sold primarily because of the name brand. it's the same thing as any other clothing item or accessory -- you're not purchasing it for quality, you're purchasing it for the name.

  it's no surprise that the united states has high rates of obesity, much more than most other countries, because there's this culture of ""bigger is better"" (meaning food). granted, i eat fast food perhaps *too* often because it's easier for me, but i'm always shocked at how large the burgers and drinks are. it's wild.

  this is going to sound gross, but i didn't want to step away from my computer while watching the speeches in case i might miss something so i ended up using the towel that i have to dry my hair to wipe my nose (not blow into it, though), lmfao.

  it has been a roller coaster of a day, my friend. i woke up this morning feeling a bit rough around the edges (i got too f*cked up last night), but ever since biden was deemed the president-elect, i've been feeling so elated, hopeful, inspired, and encouraged.
  
  in the middle of the afternoon, i started to feel *really* sh*tty physically -- i couldn't stop using the bathroom, i was very lightheaded and shaky, and i felt like i had a fever. but eventually it did subside, i was able to take a shower and eat dinner, and now i'm just reveling in the moment and having a few drinks.

  inspired, tbh. watching those speeches gave me renewed hope in this nation, and while i know what they're saying are just words for now, it makes a world of difference knowing that they're unified for a complete america -- not an america that's divided between red and blue.
  
  we have a lot of progress to do. there's so much left to undo and begin again, and so many issues left to tackle that were neglected under the trump administration, but i feel very hopeful right now.

384342,"

  i know exactly what you mean, dude. it's been four years of just ... nonsense, lies, insults, and narcissism. it got to the point where i couldn't watch trump's speeches because his voice just irritated me, so i'd read the transcripts afterwards.

  he most likely will, he'll try any attempt to save himself.

384415,"
   It doesn't matter. The law wasn't legally changed so the act still stands. They needed to be in by 8pm or technically they aren't legally cast ballots. And if I know this, I'm sure a legal expert on Trump's team knows this, which is why I think it'll be overturned.

  that does make sense. even if biden loses pennsylvania if that's the case, he'll lose 20 electoral college votes which will still put him at 270 exactly.

  "
384418,"
   Act 77 states all ballots must be received by 8pm on election night. So a lot of ballots will be thrown out after it goes to the courts because majority of them weren't delivered on time. The postmarked date is irrelevant under act 77.

   I have a feeling Pennsylvania will probably be over turned because they breached act 77.  Biden will probably still win the election without it though.
  ","
  i'm not aware of what act 77 is, but you're probably right. he won the popular vote and the electoral college, and i think a few states are still counting. i just re-checked and biden just won nevada, so now he's at 290 electoral college votes.

  the normalcy of binge-drinking to the point where it's considered alcoholism, but people are too blind (or in denial) to see it. this is especially prevalent in the united states -- and i'm sure other countries too, but since i live in the US, this is where i see it the most.
  
  i know i'm not exempt from this either, considering i do drink most nights out of the week. but the fact that it's considered normalized in society is the scary part, that people are drinking on a daily basis and think that it's ""normal"" is a detriment to how we view health and wellness.

   I've never heard of the one you mention haha I'm gonna check it out. Fahrenheit 451 is ok but I think his short stories are his best work. I thought you hadn't read the other 2 either since you asked, so yeah, I'd read the one you haven't read yet :p Did you read many books more than once?
  ","
  ""zen in the art of writing"" is more of a writing guide than anything else, much like stephen king's ""on writing"" book. i read those when i was a freshman in college during one of my writing classes.
  
  i haven't read any of his short stories, but i should definitely check them out if i enjoy ""fahrenheit 451."" as for books i've read multiple times, there have been several, haha. it's unfortunate now, but i did read the harry potter series on several occasions, and i also enjoy reading other various stephen king and anne rice books (i've read a few of king's short stories a few times and ""interview with the vampire"" twice).
  
  ""girl interrupted"" is another one of my favorites, by susanna kaysen. that has a lot to do with mental health and it was instrumental in me understanding mental illness when i was a teenager.

   Precisely because of the rules, Canada does not have many such cases. The USA and Sweden have many such cases. But in Sweden we have an extensive social safety net.

  this just furthers my belief that the US has absolutely no idea what it's doing, especially with the education system, and there continues to be so much societal divide about immigration that nothing is being done about it (regardless of what end of the political spectrum you're on).

   You can immigrate if you are admitted to a university education in Canada. But jobs without further education are few in Canada, so to prevent people from falling into financial misery, they have such rules.

   Canada, for example, requires that you have a vocational education or degree to immigrate. They are more selective. Otherwise, an ethnic underclass is built up with low wages that never become part of the majority population.

  contrary to popular belief, immigrants have actually created new job opportunities for americans because many immigrants start their own businesses and, in fact, pay taxes.
  
  as for the whole ""drug"" comment, even if someone *did* do drugs, that doesn't make them any less of a person because they're struggling with a substance use and mental health disorder. people who are drug users aren't ""inferior"" members of society, and we should erase the idea that they're not deserving of help.

   I very often hear the phrase ""you cant hate (or you cant hit) a woman because your mother is a woman"". Maybe it's just common in my country, usually men say it. I feel like if it depended on my mom alone I would be the opposite of a feminist
  ","
  feminism is about advocating for the equality (or equity) of women with the acknowledgment that men have reigned superior over women & ab*sed them for centuries. feminism is about taking back the power of control from men and fighting for women's rights.
  
  your personal disdain for your mother wouldn't detract from you being a potential feminist. just because someone is related to you by blood doesn't mean their negative actions against you are excusable.

  i'm not anti-white, rofl. i just recognize that white people have always been in positions of power and they experience white privilege (i'm white, so i experience white privilege as well).

384712,"
   white people are and have always been in a position of power so they don't care if they're disliked by a minority lol, it's not like that dislike can directly affect their lives. unlike their personal dislike of other groups which has historically been an absolute disaster as everyone knows.
  ","
  this this this.
  
  white people have always been the oppressors throughout history -- not the oppressed. therefore, if someone dislikes a white person, it isn't exactly a big deal (and it can be ""discrimination,"" not racism). some people don't understand that racism is a system of oppression that has existed throughout the centuries.
  "
384713,"

  the past few days have been fairly productive, so i'm happy about them. i've also been having a lot of fun playing halo at night with my friends.
  
  i got high last night and played a firefight with my friends, and one of my friends disguised himself as an elite and equipped himself with an energy sword and a sniper rifle, and his main mission was to k*ll us instead of the enemies. apparently one of my other friends was worried about me because i was 200% into the game and screaming my head off every time i was k*lled, lmfaoo.

  the rest of the details are fuzzy, but the weirdest thing was that i knew that i was dreaming, but there was nothing i could do to stop it. it felt like my eyes were glued shut and i couldn't move. eventually, i did finally open my eyes and wake up entirely, and the entire situation was just weird.

  ","
  i don't believe i can affect the entire world obviously, but for me, i do try to share knowledge about the things i know to people who are willing to listen by using a platform (i.e. social media). i talk primarily about mental health, because i believe it's important to open lines of discussion of mental illness.
  "
384979,"
   Let's normalize not having a mental illness or depression
  ","
  or, we should normalize the line of thinking that there are a significant number of people who do struggle with mental illness, and mental health as a whole should be spoken about *more* often to erase the stigma associated with it.

  this sounds like a complicated situation -- so basically, he asked you to marry him, and when you said you weren't ready yet, he broke up with you? that's honestly just ... bizarre.

   Should vegan/vegetarian diet be forcefully imposed on people?

  of course not. several people have dietary restrictions and food sensitivities, and it would be against their wellness to enforce a vegetarian or vegan diet onto those people.

   When it comes to information on the internet, do you fact check the stories you read or do you assume they are, by nature, factual?

What would cause you to fact check and what suggests a reliable source, in your opinion?
  ","
  i'm normally very wary of the news i see posted on social media, and i always check the source of the post before making a conclusion regarding the validity of the article. lately, i've been too busy and tired to cross-examine the news with different sources, but in general, i'm pretty vigilant.

  however, i felt much better by late afternoon and then my roommate grilled us some cheeseburgers and fries for dinner. now i'm listening to bring me the horizon and checking up on social media.
  "
385011,"
   When did you not speak up when you should have?

   Not wanting to date a trans person doesn't make you transphobic as you cannot control your sexuality. Do you agree?
  ","
  eh, not necessarily. trans men are men and trans women are women, so if you're a cis man who is heterosexual and you like a trans woman, you're still heterosexual because she's a woman.
  
  however, if you like someone and find out later on that they're trans and that dissuades you from pursuing that person further, that can be transphobic.

   Do you think for insecure people, compliments could be taken the wrong way? as in if you compliment someone who's struggling with self confidence, they could interpret it as if you're only saying those things to make em feel better and you aren't sincere?
  ","
  yes, that's quite common for people who are insecure (or honestly, people in general). i don't necessarily believe other people when they compliment me on certain things, and in my worst states of mind, it makes me feel as if they're doing it out of pity.
  "
385022,"

  i don't put in a lot of effort, because there are certain things i like regardless of whether or not they're on sale, but i do usually stick to items that are on sale that week.
  
  also, i'm actually kinda bad at sticking to my grocery list, LOL. i'll walk past something and grab it simply because i forgot that i enjoyed that particular food and felt like treating myself.

  oh, i definitely thought the initial question was platonic love, not necessarily romantic love. either way, i think the best way to tell people you have feelings for them is to simply be straightforward about it, and if they don't reciprocate those feelings, then at least you have the closure to accept it and move on.
  
  also ... ngl, the ""friend zone"" doesn't even exist, lol. if someone doesn't feel the same way towards you, it isn't some sort of insult to you or a ""woe is me"" situation. that's just how life is. people aren't obligated to like you.

  during this time, i've definitely become more independent and grown as a person, taken on more responsibilities, and learned how to be content while alone. i learned that i do really love household chores because i get to do them at my own pace and according to my own needs instead of at the whim of my parents, who were often very demanding and meticulous as to how i cleaned their house.

   How was your camping? And what does your beanie say?
  ","
  camping was *so* much fun, and i'm so ready to do it again whenever the opportunity arises. my friends picked me up friday afternoon, we got to the campgrounds around 10:00pm, and then we spent the next few hours setting up our tents, setting up the fire, grilling burgers, talking, drinking, etc.
  
  yesterday, i woke up pretty much before everyone else so i hung out for a bit around the fire. we had scrambled eggs and bacon, then just sat around and chilled for a bit. later in the afternoon when my other friends came in, we all went to the creek to go fishing (i didn't fish, though). we spent the night grilling and playing board games.
  
  then today, we left the campgrounds around 11:30am, and i just got home about two hours ago. i'm exhausted, lmaoo.

   Mewing helps with that. It's all about tongue posture. Your entire tongue should be resting along the roof of your mouth. Smile really wide and swallow, that's the posture you should keep. It takes a while but it really helps with facial structure and your jawline. Plus weight loss.

  this is a pretty controversial question from my understanding, because people argue for both sides of the coin. i don't believe you can be addicted to marijuana in itself, but you can most definitely be reliant on the feelings marijuana brings on.
  
  the main thing about addiction is that withdrawal has to happen, i believe. you don't withdraw from marijuana if you stop using it.

386076,"
   Yes it actually does. Most muslims believe everything the Quran says bc that's their holy book and a guide for righteous living. It doesn't mean you hate gay people or are afraid of them. You sound ignorant. The vast majority of Muslims have those beliefs, only a few don't.

  half of it depends on her individual views, like i stated earlier. however, i vehemently dislike trump because he is a known racist, among other terrible things, and if someone pretty much forgives trump for what he's said and done because they simply identify more with the republican party, then that's doing this country a disservice.

Idk why she wanted to be just friends and kept saying we should stop talking if we won't be something serious because she doesn't know the future. I told her I will never stop with the romantic and sxxual talk because I love her. And that was a couple days ago.

   If you could remove one season, what would it be and why? 🌱🏖🍂❄
  ","
  summer, ugh. i dislike the summer because it's always really humid and hot where i live & i can't handle the heat well.

   I need about two weeks off (if I dont tell them why they’ll probably think I have corona 😂). I moved for this job 2 years ago & just feel myself crashing. I don’t have a regular doctor here so going through that process is stressfull too
  ","
  rofl. maybe take a leave of absence, at least that way your job is protected (if you still want this job, of course). you probably would need medical documentation for that, though.
  
  i understand the frustration you're feeling. even though my job knows about my mental health problems, i do often lie and say things like i have a family emergency instead of telling them that i'm too depressed to function.
  "

   Tell me something..
  ","
  i only slept for like 4 hours but for some reason i'm wide awake rn.
  "
386175,"
   I also don’t trust that what I tell them will remain private. It’s a “gossipy” workplace, even by the managers
  ","
  ugh. can you ask for time off without specifying what it's for? idk what kind of laws surround this sort of thing, i know most places you're not obligated to tell your job why you want to take off, but there are some places that are really stingy about that type of thing.
  "
386176,"
   I’m worried about telling my employer. I really need time off due to MH issues
  ","
  i understand this all too well. :/ unfortunately it's a thin line to tread because a lot of jobs don't understand mental health needs. my job knows about my depression/anxiety, but that's only because i have a doctor's note on file saying that because of my illnesses i need to be excused for absences and whatnot.
  "
386177,"
   well, he wouldnt have had to circle back to you if you called him, said you had the wrong order and had eaten it would he? and stop using the “most ppl” wouldnt have called to excuse your own moral failures. its pathetic
  ","
  uh, how was i supposed to call him? the order was completed and the driver's information was gone. from my understanding, you can only contact the driver when they're assigned to your order, and that information disappears when the order is completed.
  "
386178,"
   Is it okay to admit if you have a mental illness? Who is it okay to tell and not tell? If you have one, are you ever afraid of how someone might react?
  ","
  in an ideal world, it would be perfectly okay and encouraged to be truthful about mental illnesses. i advocate for erasing the stigma against mental illness, because there's so much that exists that it's sometimes unsafe for people to reveal their illness.
  
  so it's obviously okay to tell someone you're mentally ill, as long as it doesn't put you in a position of harm.

   Because I cant get a gf should I change my personality and who I am so I can accually get a girlfriend. Pretend to be someone who I'm  not
  ","
  i mean, that seems like an awful lot of work to do in order to get a partner who doesn't even like the genuine you. you can't keep up the facade forever, which is why it's most important to simply be yourself.
  "
386182,"
   jfc. that was somebody’s order. what’s so hard to understand? it wouldnt have gone unnoticed. someone was waiting for it. you call
  ","
  the driver should have called doordash & said that he accidentally gave the order to someone else so that the restaurant can remake it. that way he would have picked it up fresh and delivered it to the other house faster instead of circling back around to me and asking me for the food back.
  "
386183,"
   Hello
  ","
  hello — do you have a question?
  "
386184,"
   lol. don’t claim to care about if he would lose his job or not now pls. you were all “lol. he made a mistake” like that should never happen. who knows how busy he was. the decent thing to do was still to let them know you had an incorrect order asap (contaminated or not)
  ","
  perhaps it would be the most decent thing a person can do, but i guarantee you that most people would not do that and would have just kept the food like i did.
  
  either way, him saying he should charge me for the food was wrong. that isn't even his decision to make.
  "
386185,"
   this is really awful. like wtf is wrong with you? he could have lost his job. everyone makes mistakes ffs. the decent thing to do was to call as soon as you found out
  ","
  he was going to take the bag back — that would have cost him his job because of cross contamination.
  "

   Non-binary or Pan?
  ","
  uh, one of those is a gender and the other is a sexual orientation.
  
  i'm non-binary and bisexual.
  "
386187,"
   Yeah, like what was he going to do with it anyway? Was he going to take it back and give it to someone else? You could have done something to it, how would he know?
  ","
  exactly. like listen dude it isn't my fault you gave me both bags, i didn't know any better — i thought my order was in two bags. get the fuck outta here.
  "
386188,"
   How was your day?
  ","
  i just ordered taco bell off of doordash.
  
  the dude gave me 2 bags and i didn't think anyone of it. after i went inside i realized he gave me not only my bag but someone else's bag. i shrugged and gave the second bag to my roommate.
  
  20 minutes later, the doordash driver rings me doorbell again. he asked if i had any food that wasn't ours and i said ""there was some stuff we didn't order but my roommate ate it and the rest is in the fridge."" and the doordash driver goes ""well i'mma have to charge you for that."" so i say ""listen it wasn't my fault you brought both bags to my front door."" and he immediately leaves.
  
  like... wtf. lmao.

   Someone called me an insecure loser for being single at 24 and being too shy to ask a girl out is that person right

  idk about the whole ""loser"" part, but sometimes the best option is just to go for it. the worst that can happen is that they reject you, and then you can move on with that closure.

  a person simply being friends with someone else & indicating that they just want to be friends isn't a bad thing and isn't ""oppressive"" towards people (usually men) who want something more.
