unless ive been a sleeper cell this whole time being control just to gather information ?","488262":"yes i have lol why ?","488263":"there s so many different ideas that people believe might be going on . we all perceive a different reality . . that might be because we all looking into a mirror or we are in a simulation together . its quite possible that theres realms within realms and we cant even tell , which would make some people perceptions vastly different . theres also a theory of multiverse and alternate realities . which means it s possible that you could have different realities . i pretty much cant even come close to an idea of what we all perceive and why .","488264":"just my name savannahamess but then i changed it too thesavannahames","488265":"super awkward conversations .","488266":"so there was a time where i was getting lost in the rabbit hole of youtube and i was watching real stories and one of them was about a polyamorous relationship . i was fascinated . they broke it down where they have a different relationship with a different person based their personality . example if jenna is married to jeff they have a wild fun relationship . but jenna likes to be a homebody sometimes but jeff doesn t , but that doesnt mean they still dont love each other . jenna found steve as someone she can snuggle by the fire with cause hes an introvert and enjoys a good book instead . jeff would meet stella who be young and wild . so all their needs would be equally met and then they could have a healthy relationship with each other . in my own personal life ive experienced this working really well in my group of friends . i was good at keeping the relationships cause i knew each strength of my friends and i would always be their partner in crime which made all the relationships in general healthier because they started doing the same amongst each other so why couldnt romantic relationships be the same ? i dont like sharing people though . i like being the center of attention . . so i probably would get really jealous .","488267":"omg yes . people lose my respect faster than i realize they lost my respect . . . respect is a huge deal to me . once you disrespect me i subconsciously start detaching myself from people which ends up ugly and then i always have to come back and apologize that its my fault for not talking to them about it and just getting petty . so now im trying to talk to people who disrespect me and just tell them how i feel and work through it .","488268":"im gonna be honest , i am so confused about what you re apologizing for ?","488269":"dope poppy plants milk of the poppy . i know you were just trying to be funny lol dopamine almonds , eggs , avocados , bananas , beans , fish , chicken .","488270":"yeah for the most part . or more like im just awake more often then im asleep so it just ended up timing perfectly ?","488271":"humans are great at destruction . nothing else would be the reason for the human race to be destroyed except ourselves .","488272":"nope lacking gamma aminobutyric acid , dopamine , and serotonin . . so unless you have something natural to give me for those things , i dont wanna hear it lol","488273":"am very lazy , tummy usually hurts cause of anxiety , im always cozy in bed , my mind is clearest but i dont have much energy . pm super energetic , i get the most done at night , i feel the most comfortable , my mind is open .","488274":"i feel like if we all just tripped on ayahuasca worldwide , i feel like we all connect in ways that s unimaginable . think about it . the controlling government isn t against mind altering drugs , think of big pharmaceuticals that make billions are passing out mind altering drugs . alcohol is a mind altering drug . they are against the ones that are reported by thousands of years of records of civilizations using these natural items from the earth to unify themselves . https youtu . be v epxpd https youtu . be n jq vjwrnw https youtu . be wdvsqzzpfe","488275":"i don t see any virtue in nationalism it is an accident of birth which nation you were born it it was nothing that you did for your own merit you didn t earn that you were born by accident in a particular nation why should we automatically feel the other people who were born by accident in that particular nation has something special in common with us and that we together are a group who are much more important than other groups of people ? this does not mean i m in favor of world government i detest government s that s another thing we need to grow out of we don t need governments anymore if we have them they should have a very minimal role in our society i think it s possible for the human race to relate as one family without leaders and governments who are exploiting the worst aspects of our character the lowest common denominator of our society deliberately encouraging fears and hatreds and suspicioned what responsible leaders should be doing is encouraging love and unity and failure to do that in my view disqualifies them from the leadership role entirely .","488276":"thank you so much ! hows your weekend ?","488277":"im doing okay . i woke up with an unsettled stomach though . i hope the rest of the weekend is better ! ?","488278":"i would try my best to make sure the guy understood that we are trapped together and that we should work together then i would get to know them obviously . i would kinda force myself to get along with them since im trapped on a fucking island","488279":"the earthquake in my heart from meeting you ?
