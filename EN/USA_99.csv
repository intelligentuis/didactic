  Maybe one guy but I don't think it really counts because I gave him a few days notice before the actual date. And he still got pissed off. Made me happy that I ended up canceling on him. I don't need anyone like that. He could easily find someone else in that time frame. He was very pushy to get the date to begin with. I didn't know him enough either. It seemed pretty one sided after all was said and done which gave me more concern. I was also moving a few days later so I didn't see the appeal of going on a date only to disappear soon ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

  These people were chasing us in their van. I forget what made them do that...
  
  Then the part that I was referring to was when we out drove them and were going over this bridge. Water down below. I remember seeing a car in the water.. some orange one. Then a few miles down there was another one in the water but it was a white pickup truck. And we kept on driving.. then i woke up.
  
  I was more curious about the driving, bridge and water meaning though. I don't really have dreams much about cars/driving so that was odd. Never dreamed of bridges. The water was a little strange. It was a really dark blue color and calm but looked like it could have had a current in parts too. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

  18 - I felt broken in June a bit. I was stressed, in my own head, researching a bunch of possibilities. I hate doctors so even that made it hard. It was one thing after the next. Then relieved when got the diagnosis of pcos. Was mad a bit at previous doctors who could have easily mentioned it?? I also had that savoo person be a d!ck so that didn't rub me the right way when dealing with everything else.
  
  25 - I wouldn't care that much if it was just a crush. Like oh ok, I know where I stand now. lol
  
  If I was in a relationship it would be harder that they would do that. I should be enough. I think it depends on how i found out too. Either try working on the trust there or dump him.

  Not everyone is going to like the same style. If you, the models and others liked it then good! Can only be a learning experience. Would you do it differently? Probably not! I would just focus on next time you make something. It should obviously please you first of all. If you aren't happy with the work then it would show. Just be positive and grow with the knowledge you have learned.
  
  Look at movies where the same kind of thing happened and the designer came out stronger and better than ever.
  
  You could even ask what the teacher would have liked better, more to gain knowledge instead of because you felt slighted by the lower grade.

  Motivation can be annoying like that. I feel like I've been going every other day but I do want to be more consistent with that! Swimming has been my main thing so it's nice to change it up as well.
  
  I know the gym has toning zumba but I haven't done those ones. I feel like the hours aren't that great for it though. I'd be half awake and probably injure myself. no thanks.

   How are you feeling after and before gym? How much it costs?
  ","
  Each gym is different. Paid $35 for the month. There's also different types of memberships.
  
  before -
  
  just want to get there. inspired. I usually listen to music before going to feel hyped. Or watch some fitness videos to get in the mindset too. I listened to a podcast about being happy, it was only 11 minutes but I feel like it was still good vibes. Also music. Answered a few questions here too while the podcast + music was on. I'm someone who looks at the big picture in the end so its good to be doing stuff to get to that ""end"".
  
  After-
  
  hungry lol. feeling like a badass. Knowing I'm doing good for myself. Sore. Going down 20+ steps to get out of the gym can feel liberating lol XD It's on the 2nd floor, including two studio rooms, and the indoor track overlooking the basketball court. Empowered and all that jazz. Sometimes tired. Doms are going to be real tonight, i typically do full body workouts.
  
  This guy who works there.. might be a personal trainer, I'm not sure? I remember reading that he had a military background was nice tonight. Basically complimented me so it's nice to get that kind of acknowledgement. XD

   What do you think about routine? I can never do some things the same every day. I do not think that's bad. I even think that I should try either to learn or to do exercises, whatever at the same time every day and then it will get into the routine, it will become something that is implied ...
  ","
  it can be boring at times. Nice to have structure and something to look forward to. Even small exercises (walking etc) will have more benefits than doing nothing. I don't know about the same time every time. I went a bit late tonight.. got there at 7:30 and got out around 9 something so basically before closing.
  
  I do start off on the stationary bike, I feel like that's the only routine i follow. Everything after that is different each time but still using the same equipment, just in different order. I listen to my body. Fun to change it up that way too.

I just remember that it was history based by the movies we'd always end up watching.

  No. It's normal stuff.
  
  I wouldn't want to be with someone who couldn't chill and have a good time. I'm funny so I like that banter too. If someone was serious 100% of the time, it would kill me.
  
  Everyone has a different idea on what that means. Looks aren't everything but the attraction needs to be there. Likewise other factors like personality could make the person seem more attractive.
  
  Good person is subjective again. But ya... should be!
  
  I understand the nonsmoking but it's not much of a deal breaker for me, personally. I don't smoke though.

   Have you ever interacted with someone who was deaf? How was that experience? Did you know sign language & could you interact back? :) I recently had a customer who was deaf & found it really cool how we interacted. I think a lot people give them a hard time. I think sign lang. us an awesome feature!
  ","
  My friend's sister is deaf. I learned a semester of ASL. It was cool since the teacher's son is deaf so basically had to teach herself and him it. She also wrote the books that we used - Irene Duke.
  
  There was a deaf girl at the 4th of July thing and I didn't know the words on how i would say what I was saying.. but I basically gave her the information. I could tell she was deaf since before I noticed she was signaling with her hands.

   Do you remember Yahoo chat... it censored most profanity the normal way by default, but when you typed the 'D' word, it actually replaced that with Richard. It was hilarious, but this was like two decades ago. Lyndsey must have been a few years too young for that maybe.

  Yes or a healthy balance.
  
  I didn't have all the fancy technology besides video games. But I was out with friends, riding bikes and all that. Came home when the street lights came on type childhood.
  
  My nephews only use tablets in long car rides. Sometimes at restaurants to make them behave. They go to a lot of fun places. Always surrounded by friends and family etc

  Some areas are better than others.
  
  The government is still sh!t
  
  the tv shows, Netflix üëç
  
  beauty standards are flawed
  
  diet culture can be awful. You can still be body positive while changing yourself to be better. Also other society standards can be f8cked
  
  black lives matter, of course they do but when you lash out on the smallest things to a different race - that doesn't help the movement. Stop putting people against each other, it's not beneficial. You lose focus on the real meaning.

   How do you deal with trolls on social media? Have you changed your methods? And finally, any tips?
  ","
  Sometimes they can get to me but ya.. they are bored with their own life so spreading kindness can be a fun way if you do answer them, reverse psychology, Even agreeing with them can make them back off more. They basically just want a reaction. Focus more on the good questions and that could be a big fu to the ones spreading hate still. I feel like most even want a debate at times. Just know that they aren't worth it. The words don't mean anything. They don't know everything about you. Accept that not everyone is going to like you. Continue doing the best you can.
  
  Take anon option off for a while. I feel like 99% of the time they won't keep saying stuff or they don't notice you took it off and continue to write with their name showing, block.

  I guess I'll go with never have coffee. I might have a rootbeer at restaurants or ginger ale when sick. Besides that, I never have soda. I stick to tea or water, even flavored ones at times.
  
  I also rarely drink coffee so I wouldn't miss it all that much. I need to be in the mood for it or a little treat kind of thing. Literally can't remember the last time I wanted some lol

  That could help. I feel like someone always comments that if I don't include it lol Like it's not really a go to for me when stressed. Could happen though.
  "
534120,"
   How do you get rid of stress and negative energy?
  ","
  I feel like these can be my go to's when stressed. Also if it's really bad, I get a song that always pops into my head lol so I'm like ohh man, I'm definitely stressed then.
  
  I'm a pretty calm laid back person. I do think more on the positive side. Crystals seem like a good idea. I don't have any, they can be pretty pricy for the ones id actually want. They have different  healing properties to them. Aromatherapy oils could help. I feel like I let in the bad feelings for a minute then train my mind to think of good things. Sometimes crying it out and moving on helps. Laughing. Focus on what makes you happy. Know that the energy won't always be there. It really depends on the situation as well. even breathing or yoga could help. Could even talk about it or write it all down to help get it out of your mind. doing creative things.

   Have you ever been in a relationship/friendship/whatever it may be, that wasn't right for you? In what ways was it incompatible? What do you typically look for in a relationship, as of now?
  ","
  Two come to mind. Basically a rebound for one, he went back to his ex. We didn't do anything but he shouldn't have asked me out when he wasn't emotionally available.
  
  The other lasted the longest but we just weren't right for eachother. He didn't give presents at holidays, my birthday. He was Jewish so that might be a big reason why? He was a few years younger. Wasn't really ""my type"". Didn't live that nearby but still in Massachusetts. Dumped him my senior year because it was literally going nowhere with us, wanted to be single. He was still immature as well.

  My last ex showed me how I really need to feel a connection with someone. It was way different than anything else. I just know more of what I want /need. Warning signs etc

   You have just found out for sure that your friend is cheating in their relationship..do you say something (to anyone including their significate other)...or be quiet?...
  ","
  I think stay quiet. You don't really have proof besides word of mouth. I wouldn't want to cause added drama. It's not really any of my business. If I felt more loyal to the guy, possibly. But everything still stands. If they haven't figured out then you clearly don't pay attention to your s/o.
  
  Also could get complicated if poly relationship.

   (1)Have any self help books helped you, helped you get a more positive outlook on life?  (2) Can a person who watches and reads about how to do/play a sport, actually learn how to play it, without having any previous experience in playing/doing the sport?

  Why would I wake them up so they could watch me go the bathroom? I'd understand if it was a baby but it would be weird with older kids. They don't need to see that. Or leave the door open if really worried. idk
  
  Probably. I wouldn't be naked though. Again, depends on the age too. You obviously need to keep track of babies more than older children.
  
  My babysitters were also best friends at the time and it didn't matter if naked or not.

  Talk to someone about it. Bottling it up isn't always the best option. It's also nice knowing that ""you aren't the only one"". Or a legit therapist.
  
  Analyze why you feel that way. Take steps to get out of that funk/mindset. Get rid of that toxic friend if it's caused by people. A show making you feel that way, stop watching. etc
  
  Do something you love every day
  
  Watch movies, shows, music. I feel like that helps.
  
  Even getting outside can do wonders. Don't feel like you always need to hide out? Just try feeling ""normal"" again. Go out with friends. Make plans, pushing yourself out of comfort zone can be good and helpful when down even though it might not feel like that.

  Yes, I can feel that way. I think it does depend more on the situation. I can be a peace maker and other times I just don't have it in me.

  When my brother-in-law's parents were here we all went out for dinner. On Facebook there was a picture of his mom when younger with an old babysitter and someone else. The mom wanted to get in touch with her old babysitter. There was a girl named Karen who was friends with the girl. My sister thought that she was the daughter of the girl.
  
  She sent a message saying how they would love to get together with her mom.
  
  IT WAS THE WRONG GIRL! HER MOM HAS BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS.
  
  so ya.. it was Aaron/Erin/Ellen.. not Karen. Oops. But that girl knew both of them so it was easy to play off that she meant the other girl.
  
  so awkward.

   Do you believe in love at first sight? Some people say that what they feel is love. How can you tell if it‚Äôs love or just a mere infatuation?
  ","
  Good question. I haven't really had that ""love at first sight"" moment. I did have a strong reaction to my ex but I wasn't at the love stage yet. I just wanted to know him more.
  
  To me, personally, I kind of like putting distance between the person. That way i can see if I'm just feeling good because of the attention or real feelings going on. Does that person try contacting me? Do I think of them a lot when not talking with them? Feelings last or its just the momentarily attention that I ""love"". Hope that makes sense XD

  The only good thing is his work ethic. He's done construction forever. He can wake up early and just go - even with being drunk the night before. He's also good with animals. He can be funny at times but not always.

  Ended up being a ""volunteer"" for the constable stuff. Had a magnetic badge with his name on and volunteer also on it.
  
  Basically handed out a flyer that explains what the constable is, his background in the army and whatever else was included on that. Also they ended up getting coupons for Yogurt Jungle so passed those out with the flyer. They had a tin for the waterbottles to keep iced so i kept refilling those. They had a candy basket too. Funny since the vendor next door was giving free Dentist Screenings üòÇ They made custom bags that were the real hit, along with the waters. Everyone wanted a bag XD Also they had pens where he put his information inside the cylinder. Also glowstick bracelets that the kids loved. He also got stickers for them in a star badge shape.
  
  We had a good view from where we were set up for the fireworks. Two people also had drones going nearby so I'm sure that looked cool. Fireworks were ok, not the best.
  
  My red glow-in-the-dark bracelet is hanging up on the door handle. Sometimes I have trouble finding it in the dark so figured why not put it there XD
