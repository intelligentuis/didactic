  Seeing mom drama. It can be funny about breastfeeding stuff. Like I know a mom who psychically couldn't because of her mental conditions so it just seems rude to me when it's this or that when it's not always so black and white.

  I'm not really sure. I don't really want someone the same age as my brother. Just seems creepy to me. I think it depends more on who i hit it off more with. What do they want out of life? Ready to ""settle down"" or not. Job/career? Are they still acting like pub crawlers or more responsible mind set?
  
  I guess the older because I don't really like younger guys all that much.

  I haven't stood anyone up.
  
  Maybe one guy but I don't think it really counts because I gave him a few days notice before the actual date. And he still got pissed off. Made me happy that I ended up canceling on him. I don't need anyone like that. He could easily find someone else in that time frame. He was very pushy to get the date to begin with. I didn't know him enough either. It seemed pretty one sided after all was said and done which gave me more concern. I was also moving a few days later so I didn't see the appeal of going on a date only to disappear soon ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

   How have you start building your credit? If you haven't started, when will you start? I'm just curious because my family sorta taught me fairly traditional/old school values and ways, of paying in cash. But, now I've come to realize that this world sort of depends on that credit score! :O

  I think my subconscious was telling me to go to the gym. I didn't go over the weekend. The first thing I do is go on the stationary bike. They have a course that goes through Paris and before the tower theres a bridge with water! I just had such a devu feeling XD In my dream the bridge was different but I definitely feel like it was supposed to be that bridge lol
  
  There was another dream where I was riding a bike.. don't remember everything about that one but it makes sense because the stationary bike and also the bike my sister got.

  These people were chasing us in their van. I forget what made them do that...
  
  Then the part that I was referring to was when we out drove them and were going over this bridge. Water down below. I remember seeing a car in the water.. some orange one. Then a few miles down there was another one in the water but it was a white pickup truck. And we kept on driving.. then i woke up.
  
  I was more curious about the driving, bridge and water meaning though. I don't really have dreams much about cars/driving so that was odd. Never dreamed of bridges. The water was a little strange. It was a really dark blue color and calm but looked like it could have had a current in parts too. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  Furniture moving when A) nobody was upstairs B) no furniture up there. Hearing someone go up and down the stairs when yet again nobody was there. My dad was remodeling his childhood house and spooky stuff like that and more occurred.
  
  Also one time my mom and I were driving down the road at night and I'm pretty sure these two people were ghosts. They basically jumped into the road and we swerved. It looked like they had a glow about them. Like they disappeared. There wasn't anyone still walking when I looked out the window. Like they magically appeared.

  18 - I felt broken in June a bit. I was stressed, in my own head, researching a bunch of possibilities. I hate doctors so even that made it hard. It was one thing after the next. Then relieved when got the diagnosis of pcos. Was mad a bit at previous doctors who could have easily mentioned it?? I also had that savoo person be a d!ck so that didn't rub me the right way when dealing with everything else.
  
  25 - I wouldn't care that much if it was just a crush. Like oh ok, I know where I stand now. lol
  
  If I was in a relationship it would be harder that they would do that. I should be enough. I think it depends on how i found out too. Either try working on the trust there or dump him.

  I know there's a free botanical garden event tomorrow. I haven't heard if we had plans to go but my SIL and step cousin both liked the event on FB. It would be fun to go to. Do something different.

  Not everyone is going to like the same style. If you, the models and others liked it then good! Can only be a learning experience. Would you do it differently? Probably not! I would just focus on next time you make something. It should obviously please you first of all. If you aren't happy with the work then it would show. Just be positive and grow with the knowledge you have learned.
  
  Look at movies where the same kind of thing happened and the designer came out stronger and better than ever.
  
  You could even ask what the teacher would have liked better, more to gain knowledge instead of because you felt slighted by the lower grade.

  Each gym is different. Paid $35 for the month. There's also different types of memberships.
  
  before -
  
  just want to get there. inspired. I usually listen to music before going to feel hyped. Or watch some fitness videos to get in the mindset too. I listened to a podcast about being happy, it was only 11 minutes but I feel like it was still good vibes. Also music. Answered a few questions here too while the podcast + music was on. I'm someone who looks at the big picture in the end so its good to be doing stuff to get to that ""end"".
  
  After-
  
  hungry lol. feeling like a badass. Knowing I'm doing good for myself. Sore. Going down 20+ steps to get out of the gym can feel liberating lol XD It's on the 2nd floor, including two studio rooms, and the indoor track overlooking the basketball court. Empowered and all that jazz. Sometimes tired. Doms are going to be real tonight, i typically do full body workouts.
  
  This guy who works there.. might be a personal trainer, I'm not sure? I remember reading that he had a military background was nice tonight. Basically complimented me so it's nice to get that kind of acknowledgement. XD

   What do you think about routine? I can never do some things the same every day. I do not think that's bad. I even think that I should try either to learn or to do exercises, whatever at the same time every day and then it will get into the routine, it will become something that is implied ...
  ","
  it can be boring at times. Nice to have structure and something to look forward to. Even small exercises (walking etc) will have more benefits than doing nothing. I don't know about the same time every time. I went a bit late tonight.. got there at 7:30 and got out around 9 something so basically before closing.
  
  I do start off on the stationary bike, I feel like that's the only routine i follow. Everything after that is different each time but still using the same equipment, just in different order. I listen to my body. Fun to change it up that way too.

  ","
  No. It's normal stuff.
  
  I wouldn't want to be with someone who couldn't chill and have a good time. I'm funny so I like that banter too. If someone was serious 100% of the time, it would kill me.
  
  Everyone has a different idea on what that means. Looks aren't everything but the attraction needs to be there. Likewise other factors like personality could make the person seem more attractive.
  
  Good person is subjective again. But ya... should be!
  
  I understand the nonsmoking but it's not much of a deal breaker for me, personally. I don't smoke though.

  My friend's sister is deaf. I learned a semester of ASL. It was cool since the teacher's son is deaf so basically had to teach herself and him it. She also wrote the books that we used - Irene Duke.
  
  There was a deaf girl at the 4th of July thing and I didn't know the words on how i would say what I was saying.. but I basically gave her the information. I could tell she was deaf since before I noticed she was signaling with her hands.

  What do you mean by start over? I'd rather not lose it all and regrain weight. That would just show that the current lifestyle at that time wasn't a good fit. I'd still be me but a better looking version, nothing else would change about me. I'd obviously still go to the gym to maintain everything. It's also a good stress relief at times and makes me feel way better about myself or things going on in my life.

  I ended up getting this one before. Was a dupe of the Triangle brand and Asian sized. The cups were right but there was literally no back to it and the bottoms ended up being tiny. It had a seatbelt type buckle in the back as well instead of the strap/string part.

  lol this one is all over the place.
  
  Some areas are better than others.

  the tv shows, Netflix 👍
  
  beauty standards are flawed
  
  diet culture can be awful. You can still be body positive while changing yourself to be better. Also other society standards can be f8cked
  
  black lives matter, of course they do but when you lash out on the smallest things to a different race - that doesn't help the movement. Stop putting people against each other, it's not beneficial. You lose focus on the real meaning.

   How do you deal with trolls on social media? Have you changed your methods? And finally, any tips?
  ","
  Sometimes they can get to me but ya.. they are bored with their own life so spreading kindness can be a fun way if you do answer them, reverse psychology, Even agreeing with them can make them back off more. They basically just want a reaction. Focus more on the good questions and that could be a big fu to the ones spreading hate still. I feel like most even want a debate at times. Just know that they aren't worth it. The words don't mean anything. They don't know everything about you. Accept that not everyone is going to like you. Continue doing the best you can.
  
  Take anon option off for a while. I feel like 99% of the time they won't keep saying stuff or they don't notice you took it off and continue to write with their name showing, block.

  ","
  I feel like these can be my go to's when stressed. Also if it's really bad, I get a song that always pops into my head lol so I'm like ohh man, I'm definitely stressed then.
  
  I'm a pretty calm laid back person. I do think more on the positive side. Crystals seem like a good idea. I don't have any, they can be pretty pricy for the ones id actually want. They have different  healing properties to them. Aromatherapy oils could help. I feel like I let in the bad feelings for a minute then train my mind to think of good things. Sometimes crying it out and moving on helps. Laughing. Focus on what makes you happy. Know that the energy won't always be there. It really depends on the situation as well. even breathing or yoga could help. Could even talk about it or write it all down to help get it out of your mind. doing creative things.

   Have you ever been in a relationship/friendship/whatever it may be, that wasn't right for you? In what ways was it incompatible? What do you typically look for in a relationship, as of now?
  ","
  Two come to mind. Basically a rebound for one, he went back to his ex. We didn't do anything but he shouldn't have asked me out when he wasn't emotionally available.
  
  The other lasted the longest but we just weren't right for eachother. He didn't give presents at holidays, my birthday. He was Jewish so that might be a big reason why? He was a few years younger. Wasn't really ""my type"". Didn't live that nearby but still in Massachusetts. Dumped him my senior year because it was literally going nowhere with us, wanted to be single. He was still immature as well.
  
  --------
  
  My last ex showed me how I really need to feel a connection with someone. It was way different than anything else. I just know more of what I want /need. Warning signs etc

  ok? That comment was mean first. Sorry I'm not photogenic. That i don't always like myself, especially in pictures. There's more to life than a new selfie. I tried and didn't like how they came out. I've had other people ask ""PAP"" over and over again before getting that question which was rude. I don't feel like sharing pictures from years ago when I was bigger. I'm still considered big. I now know it's due to pcos and that can also have different body image issues included. It's not the end of the world that I didn't share a picture. I'm not being a catfish etc so why do you guys always have problems with me not sharing?

  I think they can be more genuine. More about pleasing me but they still get off too. Some confidence instead of second guessing if saying /doing the wrong thing. like we can talk about nonsexual stuff too. Don't be overly creepy or too cocky.

  You can go whenever you want knowing it would be open.

  I think stay quiet. You don't really have proof besides word of mouth. I wouldn't want to cause added drama. It's not really any of my business. If I felt more loyal to the guy, possibly. But everything still stands. If they haven't figured out then you clearly don't pay attention to your s/o.
  
  Also could get complicated if poly relationship.

534817,"
   (1)Have any self help books helped you, helped you get a more positive outlook on life?  (2) Can a person who watches and reads about how to do/play a sport, actually learn how to play it, without having any previous experience in playing/doing the sport?

  Why would I wake them up so they could watch me go the bathroom? I'd understand if it was a baby but it would be weird with older kids. They don't need to see that. Or leave the door open if really worried. idk
  
  Probably. I wouldn't be naked though. Again, depends on the age too. You obviously need to keep track of babies more than older children.
  
  My babysitters were also best friends at the time and it didn't matter if naked or not.

They do it because people are too scared to talk back or share our real opinions about. Nobody ever told them no etc You could even say how it makes you uncomfortable or not want to be around them.

  About 4 times 😍 Love NYC
  
  Yes. I went to a votech hs and took Graphic Communications. We had our own press machine. Made negatives for it etc We also went on a field trip to a Newspaper Printing place. It was a little boring because we already knew a lot. Their equipment was a tad newer so that was nice...

  Talk to someone about it. Bottling it up isn't always the best option. It's also nice knowing that ""you aren't the only one"". Or a legit therapist.
  
  Analyze why you feel that way. Take steps to get out of that funk/mindset. Get rid of that toxic friend if it's caused by people. A show making you feel that way, stop watching. etc
  
  Do something you love every day
  
  Watch movies, shows, music. I feel like that helps.
  
  Even getting outside can do wonders. Don't feel like you always need to hide out? Just try feeling ""normal"" again. Go out with friends. Make plans, pushing yourself out of comfort zone can be good and helpful when down even though it might not feel like that.

  My sister dropped out. Ged. Did a bartending course. Went to community college. Got honors and also a scholarship to a real college.

  Yes, I can feel that way. I think it does depend more on the situation. I can be a peace maker and other times I just don't have it in me. Most people don't like when someone get in the middle if nobody asked for advice either hence not wanting to get involved. I'd just go with my gut, I guess. it could potentially turn someone's day around.

  When my brother-in-law's parents were here we all went out for dinner. On Facebook there was a picture of his mom when younger with an old babysitter and someone else. The mom wanted to get in touch with her old babysitter. There was a girl named Karen who was friends with the girl. My sister thought that she was the daughter of the girl.
  
  She sent a message saying how they would love to get together with her mom.
  
  IT WAS THE WRONG GIRL! HER MOM HAS BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS.
  
  so ya.. it was Aaron/Erin/Ellen.. not Karen. Oops. But that girl knew both of them so it was easy to play off that she meant the other girl.
  
  so awkward.

   Do you believe in love at first sight? Some people say that what they feel is love. How can you tell if it’s love or just a mere infatuation?
  ","
  Good question. I haven't really had that ""love at first sight"" moment. I did have a strong reaction to my ex but I wasn't at the love stage yet. I just wanted to know him more.
  
  To me, personally, I kind of like putting distance between the person. That way i can see if I'm just feeling good because of the attention or real feelings going on. Does that person try contacting me? Do I think of them a lot when not talking with them? Feelings last or its just the momentarily attention that I ""love"". Hope that makes sense XD

  What's to like about someone who can be mentally abusive? He's an alcoholic. Puts the dogs first before children. I lost respect for him when he did a domestic assault on my mom a couple years ago. We never really had a strong relationship even before that but it made me not even want to talk with him. Like do those things really scream out role model material?
  
  The only good thing is his work ethic. He's done construction forever. He can wake up early and just go - even with being drunk the night before. He's also good with animals. He can be funny at times but not always.

  Ended up being a ""volunteer"" for the constable stuff. Had a magnetic badge with his name on and volunteer also on it.
  
  Basically handed out a flyer that explains what the constable is, his background in the army and whatever else was included on that. Also they ended up getting coupons for Yogurt Jungle so passed those out with the flyer. They had a tin for the waterbottles to keep iced so i kept refilling those. They had a candy basket too. Funny since the vendor next door was giving free Dentist Screenings 😂 They made custom bags that were the real hit, along with the waters. Everyone wanted a bag XD Also they had pens where he put his information inside the cylinder. Also glowstick bracelets that the kids loved. He also got stickers for them in a star badge shape.
  
  We had a good view from where we were set up for the fireworks. Two people also had drones going nearby so I'm sure that looked cool. Fireworks were ok, not the best.
  
  My red glow-in-the-dark bracelet is hanging up on the door handle. Sometimes I have trouble finding it in the dark so figured why not put it there XD

   Is there much class consciousness where you live?
  ","
  I'd say so.
  
  Massachusetts was a mixture.
  
  Maine can be divided. Like on the other side of the lake from us is bigger houses, some guy has his own helicopter. Then on our side it can be 50/50.
  
  Arizona is weird. There's lots of nicer houses, then smaller ones. Ones that look hella ghetto in the Indian communities. There's definitely more mixture of races too.

536356,"

  something in the water
  
  food chemicals

  passed down?
  
  I think I've read that smoking can cause it too. Like our friends are on their 3rd dog and they smoke weed 24/7. I feel like they only make it maybe 5 years or so? Black labs usually last a long time? The last two both had cancer. They seemed healthy. Always swimming, running around. Happy dogs. Until they aren't....

   Would euthanatize your future husband  when he become old ?
  ","
  lol no. that would be creepy.
  
  you act like it was a real choice
  
  Reebok was literally on her death bed. Couldn't go up stairs. Was outside making god awful noises. covered in her own poop and stuff. She lived to be 18.
  
  Domino died this year. She had lumps on her, most likely cancer. She had arthritis. She was really getting bad fast. My mom and dad literally had to wrap something around her middle to go outside this winter. She also ended up peeing in the house which has never happened in her youth. Panting hard. Her stomach was also getting bloated looking. Her birthday was actually yesterday. Would have been 16 then.
  
  Bob must have been 18ish.

  not personally. I'm not a vet. Also I'd hate that job because of that.
