No...\n  \n  Ouija boards are literally just a portal to negative presences and negative energies.\n  \n  You have to really know how to use a Ouija board for you not to mess up and do it incorrectly.\n  \n  I personally know how to use a Ouija board.. but I don't use them...

I tried to educate people on Ouija boards and usually at the end of the lessons people don't even go near them anymore. These aren't just stories that I tell..

If you tell them what's going on around your house they will help you with so much and I'm serious. Play counselors can help you get out of your house if there's something going on.\n  \n  They will help you get driving lessons they will help you do all kinds of things.\n  \n  If you think that moving out and going with this other person that you're talking about is a good idea then go with it.

Don't just get up and go because then you can't get your things. And when you leave you need to explain to your parents the reason why you were going is not because you hate them it is because you were trying to grow up. It's time for you to grow up. Some parents tend to be a little overprotective because they want the best for you. They want to protect you because this world is crazy. But you should definitely be able to learn how to drive and get a job at this age. This is the age def to be doing that...

And they see that you aren't ready. Use living with your parents as an advantage. Get a job and save money. Finding a place to rent or put a down payment on house. Find you a room mate and rent.\n  \n  If your parents are really strict usually it's because they're trying to help you succeed.\n  \n  There is a small amount of parents that don't give a sh-t and are abusive and horrible to their kids. But this is not always the case.\n  \n  Respect your parents. Keep them on your side. Because when sh-t hits the fan you're going to need them. Your parents are who you want to be close to always. They're going to be the grandparents of your children. They raised you. They gave you so much.\n  \n  Though Idk your sistuation personally. This is what I hope they have done for you. Give them credit. If they even stay in your life and kept you under their roof they did enough for you.  Some kids growing up don't have parents and die for that type of affection and attention...\n  \n  You're going through some stuff in your life... try to let your parents know that you want to start over with them and try to make a relationship with them.\n  \n  And if you feel like you are able to take care of yourself then let them know that.  but if you are not sure that you can take care of yourself and why not just stay?\n  \n  Just wait... you have your whole life ahead of you.

It's not that much at all a visit..) and two.. because they can help you adjust your diet to where you want...and to... lose weight.\n  \n  Sometimes it's not always good idea for you to do it yourself, because you could be going at it wrong and that could be the reason why you're getting discouraged.\n  \n  You can ask your doctor for maybe either some weight loss pills? or to change your diet? At the same time you need to exercise a lot and a properly. You can also get you a personal trainer or maybe ask your doctor to give you recommendations if they have any?\n  \n  Three you have got to build your self-esteem and confidence and believe that you can do it.\n  \n  To lose weight you have to be positive and believe in yourself you cannot be negative.\n  \n  You also have to be patient. Losing weight does not take 2-3 weeks. I don't care what any of those ads online say... or any of those YouTube videos say... Losing weight can take them months, to years, but is possible for anyone.\n  \n  But do not procrastinate and not go to the doctor. This is the best way to start your dieting.\n  \n  Another thing is do not do it for just the first week and then give up stick at it. Make it a new lifestyle.\n  \n  Make it a challenge and give up a few things.\n  \n  One year I gave up for a couple months chocolate and soda and then after I just kept going with it. Now.. I don't really eat anymore sweets like I used to and I don't drink anymore soda.\n  \n  Soda is bad for you. It's okay to have a little bit every now and then but then you become addicted to it. Soda hurts your stomach and doesn't have a poistives to it... Cut is out for awhile... you will see that you will feel more energy in your life and that you won't want it anymore... Just by cutting soda out completely. Try homemade lemonade? Or tea maybe? Not huge portions.. No. Water needs to be your best friend. Try infused water. It is fun and delicious.\n  \n  But honestly I'm not a doctor. See your doctor and def.\n  ","54240":"\n  Say idk?\n  \n  Ask someone else.\n  \n  Google.\n  \n  Ummmm...

They should be appreciative of there significant other because they could had those types of things happen to them...\n  \n  Yes we chose those difficulties and we accepted the challenge... but see my point is... people take things for granted, they don't have nothing to show for anything? They aren't respectful of what they got. They aren't appreciative of what they've got. They think the wrong things that a relationship revolves around. People have lost hope and long-term relationships and marriage... loyalty... and being faithful to one another... People also think that you have to have someone else in your life to live. Everyone is so afraid of being alone that they settle for the lowest. You can live alone and by yourself and be independent and happy. You don't NEED somebody else.

I love being with my husband and I'm very appreciative of him and what I've got.\n  \n  People don't even simply just take a shower? there's no self-respect? they don't care for themselves so how can they care for somebody else? They don't go to the doctor? They don't care about having multiple kids on accident? They don't care if they catch a disease? They don't care if they wear nasty, revealing clothes?

I'm happy for every single event that has ever happened in my life, negative or positive, everything happens for a reason. And this all is as result. I am haloy and married.

I believe once at the beginning of the year and it wasn't that bad and I think it was just on my arms.\n  ","54597":"\n  Absolutely.\n  \n  And blizzard isn't even the level of how cold it gets out there. They called there Winters, dark Winter. There in that part of the world, it gets around 20 hours of dark and only a few hours a light and then it reverses depending on the times of the year and stuff and the world axis.\n  \n  So you may have to get used to that kind of stuff. Going to sleep with the sun still out but it's actually nighttime technically or in other words time to go to sleep and rest. It sometimes being longer days 20 something hours long of light and only a few of night.\n  \n  But when in the winter... I mean it gets negative -40, -50, -60 with wind chills making it even colder. I mean you have to wear like tons of clothing, masks, gloves, socks and socks, boots and you can't be out too long or you will catch hypothermia in minutes. And then the snow is so piled up in front of the doors and then it's hard to walk through it and then the wind hitting you? Omgosh...\n  \n  But the summers are so nice.\n  \n  You really have to learn to adapt when moving to Alaska. You have to learn nature tips and survival tips. How to start a fire. Learn how to hunt and keep tons, too much in your freezer just in case if you're not able to leave your home for weeks.\n  \n  You have to be careful because there are not many towns and cities and right next to each other. There are towns and cities but not as abundant as other parts of the world and other places.\n  \n  When going through the town and cities unless you live around the stores... sometimes they run out of items because there's not as many stores as other places outside of Alaska so you maybe limited on supplies.\n  \n  When living really far out in the bush, if you need a hospital, doctor attention you have to ride hours maybe even a plane to get to the nearest hospital or doctor.\n  \n  I'm not knocking Alaska. It's really a challenge living out there. It is totally worth it and is an absolutely beautiful place with its nature. I want to move myself.\n  ","54598":"\n  I would consider.

A lot of the land has been sitting there for hundreds of years, if not longer, and hasn't even been walked on before.\n  \n  It is absolutely an amazing place to go to in the summer. It's not too cold or hot it's just right. There's lots of natural, fun activities to do. You can also maybe get with family that's out there, maybe stay, and maybe have them show you some of the traditions of how they hunt\/catch and prepare their food. They will show you how they live out there. It is slightly different out there especially in the deep dark winters with temperatures very very very low such as -40 negative -50 s if not lower with wind chills even more colder.\n  \n  The only thing bad about the summer is just everything is so dry..  flicking a cigarette is almost a crime...\n  \n  But Alaska to me I feel like is amazing vacation spot. Lots of fishing and hunting. King Salmon as big out there. You can go bird shooting\/hunting and Egg nest catching (sounds horrible but there are millions of eggs out there layed in Alaska and it's actually an Alaskan tradition for some families to go out nest catching, not the exact name for it but is a type hunting\/collecting done out there) you can go moose hunting, there is fox, caribou I believe, polar bear, many different species of birds, wolves, lynx... And so much more.\n  \n  There's more to Alaska than just the hunting and fishing, there's tourist, riding in Planes, visiting the beauty of the land, mountains, plenty of snow! ...staying in a cabin, tent camping, there's Rivers, hotels...
