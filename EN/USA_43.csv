  That sucks dude. Sorry you’re feeling upset.

   What is a waste of money?

  Designer brands. You end up paying more money than things are worth just because it has a logo on it. Plus a lot of designer labels aren’t made very ethically and use sweatshops and child labor to produce products. Overall it’s all very silly and pointless to me

230712,"
   It worked for me actually, I was scared to death just by the idea of arguing with them lol my brother was different, he was always in trouble. You never got spanked?
  ","
  The idea of being afraid to voice your different opinions or arguments to your legal caretakers just baffles me. I’m sorry you had to fear the idea of voicing a different opinion or belief than they had...that just seems messed up. You obviously don’t seem screwed up about it and that’s good...that’s on you so good for you for not internalizing it too much. But from my point of view, having to normalize that kind of behavior from the people who you’re supposed to look up to is very toxic. That’s not a healthy relationship model to base your own beliefs about your future relationships on and that seems to show in your answers.
  
  I was spanked twice in my whole life and it did nothing to make me reconsider my actions and only served to spark the same fear in me as you described it did with you. My parents actually recently told me that they felt bad for losing their tempers and spanking me those times because they saw that it only made me pull away from them more and cause a rift in our relationship. I get that parents can’t be your friend all the time and they have to “lay down the law” sometimes but physical violence is never called for and only puts the idea in kids’ heads that that’s an acceptable reaction to  dealing with different opinions, making mistakes, or becoming overwhelmed.
  
  Still no offense or hate or anything. That’s just my objective, outsider’s opinion, as someone who knows nothing about you or your family.

230716,"

  ","
  Still doesn’t make sense to me...not to call anyone out or anything, no hate to you or your family, but as someone who doesn’t really agree with spanking in general, that seems abusive. Whatever worked for y’all, but that just doesn’t seem logical to me. Like I said though, different strokes for different folks.

   What is your attitude towards hunting?
  ","
  lots of people are ready to condemn hunting immediately because its killing wildlife for sport and that’s a controversial subject. I don’t condemn hunting though ‘cause it’s because of hunting that a lot of money has been raised to protect and conserve the environment. I myself don’t hunt bc killing makes me uncomfortable and feel bad, but it’s an important way to manage wildlife populations, raise money for the environment, and get people to genuinely care about the natural world around them

  It’s generally thought that even in ancient times, Egypt was racially diverse and couldn’t be exactly classified as either white or black. Actually, skin color seemed to be varied between the peoples of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Nubia, who in various eras rose to power in Ancient Egypt.

   What happens when two people ride a horse?
  ","
  The two people would first have to make sure they were in the correct position and not sitting too far forward or back on the horse’s back to make sure it was safe, but also it would greatly depend on the size/weight of both the horse and the combined weight of the people. All horses have weight limits for things they can carry that can’t be exceeded, otherwise they risk injury.
  
  A general rule I was taught is if you (or the weight of the 2 people) weigh more than 20% of your horse’s entire body, then you’re too heavy to ride that horse.
  
  For example: an average horse weighs ~1200 lbs, so the animal cannot safely carry a rider(s) + equipment of more than 240 lbs without risk of serious injury

   Does it hurt the horse to sit on it's back? To be in contact with the spine?
  ","
  Great question! If you’re a balanced rider who maintains proper body position while balancing your own weight over the horse’s 15th thoracic vertebra, allowing your weight to be supported on their latissimus dorsi by your thighs, dropping your weight down through your calves to your heels, you won’t hurt the horse at all! That’s because this position aligns the rider’s center of gravity with the horse’s center of gravity, therefore making it easier to carry you. It also puts the most weight on their supporting back muscles (the lats) which are very strong.
  
  When riding in a saddle, in order not to cause the horse discomfort, you should still maintain correct body position as well as having the saddle placed between T8 and T18, so as not to put any weight on the floating ribs or  hinder the shoulder blade movement.
  
  If you’re unbalanced and flop around on their back then no matter if you have a saddle or not you could potentially make them uncomfortable or eventually injure them after repeated rides.
  
  Here’s an infographic I created showcasing correct and incorrect rider position!

  True lol. You know, surprisingly I’m not a big fan of horse racing. There’s a lot of things that go on behind the scenes at racetracks that I don’t care for and find very cruel.
  
  I’m also not a particular fan of a lot of the physical ramifications that racing has on horses’ bodies, even if they’re actually treated fairly by their owners.
  
  There are also alot of people in the racing industry that are in it more for the money than for the love of the sport and, therefore, end up treating their animals only like numbers and money making machines and don’t care about their wellbeing. Lots of horses who aren’t considered winners are treated poorly and cast aside or sold off to kill pens to await slaughter to become dog food 😭

  Hah yeaaaah a bit tough to learn at first ngl, but SO worth it! And honestly ANYONE can learn to ride relatively quickly if you have good instruction and a calm, experienced, horse to learn on.
  
  Horses are basically like big tiptoe-y dogs 😂 Most are very sweet and willing to be calm and friendly to you and won’t get upset if you do something wrong while riding or handling them. Especially a lot of horses owned by riding schools. They’re usually pretty used to being used for teaching beginner riders the basics and are pretty slow and steady ☺️
  "
230824,"
   It looks difficult, I’m afraid of falling off
  ","
  Yeah it kinda sucks to fall off but it’s just another mental hurdle you gotta overcome. The tighter you are with your body and the more you squeeze and get nervous, the more likely you are to fall. It’s so weird but if you pretty much ignore every natural instinct your body tells you to do like leaning forward, or squeezing, or looking down, then you’ll actually have a much easier and safer experience 😂😂

   pros an cons about horses?
  ","
  Pros: gets you outside, keeps you in-shape and healthy, working with horses teaches you a lot about yourself and helps you grow, gives you a sense of responsibility, brings people together over a common interest, automatic fluffy friend and partner to hang out with, chilling with them is good to help you relax, horses are great listeners and awesome secret keepers, it’s super fun to ride, lots of different sub categories of equine sports so there’s something for everyone, they’re soft and gentle like big doggies if you’re friends with them, they’re so pretty and make great models 📸
  
  Cons: hard work and dedication to keep them in shape for riding (especially if you want to compete), health bills like farrier & dentist & vet & feed bills can be expensive, sucks up a lot of your free time (if you’re their only caretaker), they need to live with a friend like another horse or even a dog or goats so you have to have more than one animal otherwise they can legit die of loneliness, horses are high key accident prone and will find new and interesting ways to accidentally hurt themselves

  Not really sure why you’re so curious/persistent...but like I wasn’t allowed piercings or hair dye or anything, I wasn’t allowed to wear any clothing to school that wasn’t approved by my mom,I wasn’t allowed to eat certain foods my mom didn’t like, I couldn’t have my phone in my room after a certain time of night, couldn’t hang out with people my parents didn’t know and approve of, that sort of stuff.
  "
230976,"
   I thought you could wear thermals leggings or something like that. Is there any situation where you wear more layers than for riding?
  ","
  Yeah you could totally wear thermal leggings under your breeches if you wanted, I just don’t own any. Regular leggings have worked really well for me and they’re cheaper so I don’t see the need :P
  
  If you’re sitting around a lot, like if you’re on the sidelines at a show or something or in the warmup ring, then I usually have on pajama pants over my breeches too so I don’t get dirt on them and it’s also slightly warmer. If I’m just sitting there in the stands waiting my turn or cheering on my team then I tend to layer up in human blankets and quarter sheets...basically anything that’s on hand at the time. I like blankets better than more layers of clothes cause it’s honestly just way more convenient. They’re just easier to take on and off while wearing a riding helmet cause you don’t have to put them over your head like a hoodie or something.
  
  If you did want another jacket then things with zippers are your friend! 😂 Any extra jackets I’d consider wearing would NEED to have a zipper. Nothing more annoying than having to take off your helmet to remove or put on layers of clothes after you finally got all your hair to fit in it without making you look like a mushroom head 😅😂
  
  (Long hair probs lol)
  
  Even when I’m doing barn chores I don’t tend to layer up too too much unless it’s extremely cold. It’s pretty difficult to move around a lot in heavy layers of clothing when you don’t need them. Plus I always end up getting too hot and sweaty if I have too many layers. Farm chores can be tough physical work lol. As long as I keep moving I’m usually not cold.
  
  Just btw, why do you ask?
  "
230977,"
   so are zebras related to horses or nah
  ","
  Yeah they’re related pretty closely! Zebras are in the same family, Equidae, and are also part of the same genus: Equus. Even though they’re closely related they aren’t the same species though (ie zebras aren’t just stripey little horses, they’re their own separate thing) 🦓
  "
230978,"

  Move on and don’t think about your ex. Do things that make you happy and do them for no one but yourself. Don’t post all over social media about the breakup and don’t look at old pictures. Don’t hide your emotions from yourself and push them away. Process what happened, allow yourself to be sad, analyze the situation, and grow from it. Just try to be happy and focus on yourself, otherwise you’ll take a long time to heal and be bitter

  Yeah for sure! As the oldest child I was the guinea pig lol. My parents learned a lot from raising me for a while first, so a lot of things my parents did for me they did differently for my little sister.

   Ugh you are adorable and amazing. So I hears from a carriage driver that cobblestone roads were really good for the horses feet. Is that true? If so why?
  ","
  Not sure what your carriage driver was talking about. Walking is usually fine, but moving at a trot or canter on cobblestones (like running on any hard surface like pavement or cement) are tough on a horse’s hooves, ligaments, tendons, and joints because the surface isn’t as soft or forgiving as grass or dirt.
  
  You could compare it to human athletes running barefoot on a road or sidewalk. It’s doable, but pretty uncomfortable and if you do it a lot you’re going to eventually get foot, ankle, tendon, and knee injuries. Not to mention cobblestone can also get pretty slippery when it gets wet so it’s even more dangerous for horses to move quickly over it in inclement weather

   And I remember learning something about a muscle or cartiladge in the feet behind the hooves that help shoot blood back up the leg when they step. I think it's called the frog or something? Know what I'm talking about?
  ","
  Yeah that has nothing to do with sleeping but you’re mostly right about the function and placement on their body. You were right, it IS called the frog and it has less to do with shooting blood back up the leg and more to do with acting as a shock absorber when they bear weight on their hooves while in motion. Looks like this (in the yellow marked area)
  "
231113,"
   Do horses ever lay/sit? If so, when?
  ","
  Yeah they lay down every day for around 15 min at a time a few times a day to get deep REM sleep. The rest of their sleep cycle is spend standing up and locking their knees so they don’t fall over. They do this by using a special system of joints and ligaments in their legs called the stay apparatus

  "
231124,"
   Do you feed your horses with Apples ? 🍏 🍎 The seeds has arsenic and are poisonous ☠️!!!
  ","
  It would take an average sized horse eating over 400 apples at once for the level of arsenic to build up enough to be deadly. The horse would definitely be full way before that point lol.
  
  On a similar note though, feeding horses too many apples can cause them to colic which can lead to death. Apples are a good treat every once in a while but definitely not an every day thing

231126,"
   Do you think those poor horses in Central Park NY get Spooked by vehicle noises? 🐎

  If they receive proper training and are carefully and humanely desensitized to loud sounds then no they shouldn’t spook at traffic noises.

  Depends on their work load but usually they get grain one time a day and hay or grass to eat all throughout the day. They don’t really ever stop eating except to sleep or exercise. If they don’t eat for a long period of time it’s really bad for their digestive system

  While it’s technically legal to do so I don’t see the point.

  ","
  I despised PE with all my being. It was smelly, the gym was dirty and covered in layers of other kid’s sweat, the activities were pointless beyond belief (we had a whole “dance unit” where they made us learn the chicken dance and chacha slide and an entire bowling unit...), it was a huge source of stress having to change in the locker room in front of others, I hated smelling bad for the rest of the day, the PE clothes were unflattering and uncomfortable as hell, and the guys in the class always took the opportunity to harass the girls and try to show off. It was a nightmare and I’m not sure what the point of it all was. I wasn’t any healthier for it and I certainly wasn’t happier.

  I read one time that the whole reason people have middle names is that in the middle ages back when people hard-core believed in magic and witches and stuff, you gave your children a “secret” name (aka middle names) so that when they introduced themselves to strangers they wouldn’t be able to cast a spell on them if they were a witch since they didn’t know the children’s entire full name. Not sure if that’s fully true but it sounded like a cool story to me lol

  ","
  Not quite sure what you mean. You’re going to have to provide an example I think because I don’t quite understand your point.
  
  Also, neither gorillas nor chimpanzees are monkeys. They’re both classified as species of great apes. Species are different than breeds. For example, we have lots of breeds of domestic dogs, but all domestic dogs belong to the same species, canis lupus familiaris, just like we have many breeds of domestic horse but they all belong to the same species, equus caballus

  I can speak some German but not really any other language.
  
  I think I mostly want to visit countries in Asia because a lot of their traditional culture and food is so different from the western cultures I grew up in. I just find it really cool and fascinating and I want to learn more about them. Not sure what places I’d want to go specifically though
  "
231372,"
   how about asian horses then? is there any difference?
  ","
  Haha horses in Asia belong to the same genus, Equus caballus, as all other horses and ponies. There’s no difference between countries.

231373,"

  My family and I traveled all around when we lived in Germany. We went to France, Spain, the Czech Republic, Austria, Bavaria, and some others!

  "
231374,"

  Ponies are just short horses. Anything under 14.2 hands tall is considered a pony. They have the same exact anatomy and physiology

  It only took me a few times of babysitting children to discover that really really wasn’t about it. I’ve only really ever changed 0-1 year olds.
  
  I know that it can take some kids up to three years old to learn to use the toilet though so I’m sure changing a three-year-old would be perfectly fine and plausible
  "

  Idk, just see if their diaper is dirty. You can usually just tell by how it looks and smells...
  
  Dude I gotta tell you, I feel like you’re really barking up the wrong tree here, asking me of all people, a person who actively avoids and dislikes children and all aspects of child care, for advice on child care.
  
  I’m trying to give you the best advice I can, but I really don’t know that much about taking care of babies. I’ve done it, it’s not that difficult, I just hate it a lot.
  "
231381,"
   What was your first paying job?
  ","
  I worked at a pet daycare/kennel!
  "
231382,"
   I’ve never had to change one before.. that’s what I’m most worried about. Have you done it a lot?
  ","
  I’ve done it a few times. You really can’t mess it up, it’s not that big of a deal. Just make sure the baby is clean and dry before you put on a new diaper and try not to be too rough with them. They have sensitive skin so just treat them carefully and it’ll be alright.
  "
231383,"
   Do you ride often?
  ","
  As often as I can find time to get out and see the horse, yes
  "
231384,"
   Did you have to deal with naps, diapers, or feeding? Which is the worse?
  ","
  Naps are glorious and silent once you get them to go to sleep but ACTUALLY getting them to sleep can be a pain. Changing diapers and feeding really isn’t that bad
  "
231385,"
   Wow, if I have the chance like that I'll take it, I Love to learn a lot about animals mostly of their behavior and about horses, they're majestically classic and I Love it. its like you study them pretty well, you can even open up a ranch or a school for people who are really interested

  Pros: they think you’re waaaay older than you are so they believe anything you tell them, easily entertained, memory of a goldfish, easy to get along with
  
  Cons: loud and messy af, starting to become opinionated, will tell you “NO!” when asked to do things, that’s around the time when they start to ask “Why! Why! Why!” all the time until you go insane

  "
231389,"
   Haha I think he think of it as a catchy one calling him Chance and wow you really know a lot about them, is there any way to tell if the horse is healthy physically? I have no idea how to tell lol. how old is he?
  ","
  Yeaaaah haha in order to be an ethical and kind horsewoman you gotta know a lot about horses :P i’ve been around them for a lot of years, so I’ve just ended up seeing and hearing a lot about them.
  
  There are lots of physical indicators of horses health. Just like any animal you can look at their body to see if they have any visible signs of neglect or abuse like large lacerations or infected areas. That would probs be pretty obvious haha
  
  You can also look at their body condition relative to their age. Older horses can sometimes look a bit thinner and droopier just like elderly people, but young horses shouldn’t look that way. You shouldn’t be able to see a young healthy horse’s ribs, backbone, and hip bones too clearly. That would mean that they’re too skinny and don’t eat enough food. It’s also bad for them to be way too fat. You can also look at their hooves and see if they’re overgrown (indicating poor health and bad care from their person) or if they’re nicely maintained and help the horse bare weight evenly. You can look at their teeth, coat condition, eyes, lots of things can tell you if a horse is feeling well or not.
  
  Chance is currently 21 I believe. He’s getting a bit old but I wouldn’t consider him to be ancient or anything. Horses can easily live up into their 30s 😊
  "
231390,"
   Have you ever had to watch one? You seem like you would be good with them!!

  ","
  Don’t be impatient I was typing answers to other questions lol
  "
231393,"
   Why Chance? its kind of unique. do you play with him? or he's a race horse?
  ","
  Not sure, I didn’t name him. His full register name is Royal Fancy Chance. Horses get named after their parents, usually some sort of spinoff of their father’s names. It’s traditional I guess. I like calling him either Chancellor or Chance the Horse like Chance the Rapper haha.
  
  He’s an arabian cross and has never raced. He was bred for western pleasure I think but has been a trail horse for most of his life. We usually go on nice trail rides and do strength training up and down hills, practice flatwork and balance exercises with leads and diagonals, and work on bending. Just keeping him in shape and helping him keep entertained.
  
  I’d love to teach him to jump one day but I’m not sure if he’ll ever really be able to jump very high. He seems to enjoy doing it on his own when he’s out running around the pasture but he’s getting kind of old now to do too much difficult work with a rider on his back lol

  I myself don’t own any horses but have leased and ridden lots in the past.

  ","
  His name is Chance and he lives on pasture board so he’s always outside. He’s free to roam around, eat grass,  and run whenever he wants to 😊
  
  He also has 24/7 access to a natural freshwater spring so he’s never thirsty or too hot. He loves to splash in the water it’s adorable!

   What is your opinion on animal abuse? 🐶🐱🐵🐯🐷🦊🐻🐼
  ","
  Animal abusers should have to both pay fines and go to jail for a long time for their crimes. People convicted of animal abuse should never ever ever be allowed to have any more animals ever again as well. They should also be put on a watch list like pedophiles and monitored to make sure they can’t own or harm any living creature ever again.
  
  In severe cases, animal abuse is often a sign of someone who is more likely to take the next step and begin abusing or killing people too. In addition to jail time, fines, and a watch list, these offenders should have to take a medical assessment to see if they are likely to become dangerous to society.

  Being a park ranger was actually pretty cool. It could be stressful at times because people were pulling me in a bunch of different directions all at the same time and I had to be really knowledgeable about the park and the surrounding ecosystem, but after I got into the groove it was a pretty awesome gig. I was a wildlife interpreter ranger. Basically I taught people about nature like about the animals in the park and about fish and trees and stuff and I lead hikes and other programs outdoors! My favorite thing I had to do as a park ranger was leave the nature shows and handle the display animals that belonged to the park
  "

   I agree with that so much! Like when someone is nice to be at my job now, I try my best to help them, but when they are rude, I’m still nice, but they don’t get “as much” of help as I can give :) I appreciate even if they are rude if they apologize for it, that makes me much happier:)

  Completely agree. Some people obviously just don’t understand that the world doesn’t revolve around them and that being rude to people won’t make them want to help you lol. I try to be really friendly to any service job workers I see just for that reason and they always seem relieved and are really nice back.
  
  Apparently they thought that they would be able to afford to pay the people they hired $10 an hour but after hiring too many people bc of bad management and also after having their budget cut back by the president by 5% they took their promise back and could only afford to pay me that much. I used to be  a park ranger lol. The parks system has been taking a lot of budget cuts under the current administration unfortunately :/

  "
231612,"
   Well you and other pretty girls like you who are generally out his league?
  ","
  In general I’ve found that most pretty girls are really used to people treating them weirdly and being awkward or shy when talking with them. Be confident and kind! If people aren’t being shy I find a lot of times people can also come off WAY too forward and it’s often VERY creepy. NO cat calls or mentions of her body or anything sexual. I’m sure you’d never do that but some people still need to hear that for some reason. Everything is a balance, ya know?
  
  I’m sure I also don’t have to tell you this too haha but don’t stare at her inappropriately, try to find common interests, smile, be yourself, and ask her questions! Treat her like any other normal person! Don’t make her feel like you talking to her is for the purpose of some “end goal” if you know what I mean and don’t objectify her or come into it feeling as if your kindness makes her “owe you” anything.
  
  For real that’s all the advice I have for rn. Just be cool and casual and be you! 😌💕✨

   So if Ignorant Americans are requiring everyone incl. tourists to speak freakin’ English in America then should the French also require the arrogant and loud American tourists to speak French? Thoughts 💭....
  ","
  It’s not a requirement? Things are printed in both English and Spanish and sometimes also in French on most products in America and you won’t be hard pressed to find someone who can at least speak Spanish here in the us. Rude people give this country a bad name but it’s not all loud and rude. This opinion is abrasive.

   Thanks but my uncle is not a mechanic. That’s my point.
  ","
  Well, yeah of course not. Otherwise he wouldn’t have taken it to the shop lol.
  
  All I’m saying is that I believe what your mechanic was asking your uncle was NOT “please diagnose exactly what’s wrong with your vehicle for me” and was actually more along the lines of “does it make a funny sound, do anything abnormal when you drive it, have a check engine light on, a noticeable leak from the bottom, etc”.
  
  You don’t need to be a mechanic to realize your car’s brakes stopped working out or it screeches when you make turns and stuff like that haha. I think he probably just wanted a bit more information before he had to look at every single part of the car to see what worked and what didn’t.
  
  My mechanic asks the same questions of me when I bring my truck into the shop. Always thought it was a standard question. Like how the doctor says “what brings you in today?” when you visit. Like you don’t know exactly what’s wrong with you but you know what the symptoms are so they can figure it out for you. That kinda thing.
  "
231758,"
   So my uncle brought his car to the shop cause there’s something wrong with it...Mechanic: What’s wrong with your car sir? Uncle: Are u dumb, if i know what’s wrong with it then i could’ve diagnosed it myself! I thought you’re the mechanic idiot!...Does my uncle has a point?
  ","
  Your uncle sounds like he’s being rude for no reason...no point in being rude to someone who’s required to ask you that question as part of their job.
  
  Any info he would’ve provided to the mechanic would have been helpful and would’ve helped them do their job quicker and easier, therefore costing your uncle less money in labor costs since it would’ve helped them spend less time trying to figure out what to work on on the car...you asked my opinion and there it is.

  I try my best to dismiss them. The voice in my head can be pretty loud sometimes but over the years I’ve learned that I can help quiet the little negative voice by reminding myself of all the things that I am blessed for. A loving support system of family and friends, wonderful pets, a roof over my head, good food to eat, and cloths to wear 😊
  
  Doing things I enjoy also helps me to quell negative thoughts. Going outside for a walk (even just for a few minutes), doing art, playing with pets, singing, photography, etc.  Getting a hug from my boyfriend always really helps too. He’s really supportive

  If it came down to it and my husband really just wouldn’t work for the sole reason that he was lazy I would seek marriage counseling before just leaving him completely.  If he couldn’t work because he was injured or sick or something that would be a different story but not if he was just deciding to be lazy. If getting help for the problem didn’t work then I would probably try to divorce him. Relationships have to be 50-50, where each partner tries their best and helps support each other

   Your law argument is irrelevant because I asked about how things should be, not how they are. A lot of laws are unjust and imperfect, doesn't mean we should live with them. Also, how exactly would it breed KKK and white supremacists?

  Because that’s what hate groups like nazis and the kkk do...they exclude and ridicule and demonize people/groups they feel superior over and then spread those ideals and continue to raise children who are taught those racist and hateful things, thus breeding and creating more unnecessary hatred in the world. People who know nothing but hate have no place in a compassionate and forward-thinking society.

  US federal laws prohibit discrimination based on a person's national origin, race, color, religion, disability, sex, and familial status. Laws prohibiting national origin discrimination make it illegal to discriminate because of a person's birthplace, ancestry, culture or language. That includes laws prohibiting or excluding people from living in a specific town or city.

   Why do you love giving stupid unsolicited advice? That lady in Rural Kentucky is basically a white trailer trash. 😠👎

  A few things to say about this:
  
  1. It’s not unsolicited advice if someone asks for your advice... it must be very hard for you to live a normal everyday life being so ignorant 🤷🏽‍♀️I’m truly sorry the education system failed you so badly.
  
  2. Why do you love monitoring my account and commenting disparaging things? Especially when cowering behind anon? If you have something to say then say it with your name attached. The only reason you won’t come out and say rude things off anon is because you know you’re being rude and don’t want others knowing how hateful your opinions truly are.
  
  3.  The person mentioned never specified their gender so how would you know if they were a man or woman? I think that you sent me that question just to start discourse because you’re bored.
  
  4. Regardless of if it was you pretending to be someone else or not, putting others down based solely on on their socioeconomic status or family background is disgusting. You are a rude, overprivlaged, unaware person. I didn’t ask your opinion nor do I care to hear it. Keep it to yourself.

  I used to sip beer and wine with my parents lots when I was younger, probably from around 9-12 years old maybe?Thats when we lived in Europe. We did a bunch of wine and beer tastings in Germany and France cause my mom loves wine and my dad loves beer. I always took one sip and thought it tasted horrible every time lol.

   Why do a lot of you Americans are very uncomfortable when asked about your age, weight and sexual orientation?

  I’ve experienced that in multiple cultures. Lots of cultures put a lot of emphasis on outward appearance and put pressure put on people to look and feel beautiful and young like a 20-year-old for their entire lives..But that’s just obviously unattainable for most people. That’s why I think some people get uncomfortable with the idea that they’ve aged and no longer look like somebody who is 25 years old anymore. They feel pressure to be a certain way and feel abnormal when they can’t live up to that standard.
  
  As far as orientation goes, that just seems to be a very personal question. Lots of people aren’t keen to share such personal things. Maybe because they’re nervous that it will bring on some sort of judgment from others or maybe because they aren’t comfortable with it themselves yet

  Haha okay good luck. Profs are PhD’s usually, they are pretty objective and fair most of the time. If you have evidence that suggests one group member didn’t contribute then they’ll act accordingly in my experiences.
  
  I’d lay out exactly what expectations were given to you and then give the expectations that were placed on the other group members and myself. They would be an even and fair set of expectations that divided up the work between all members equally. I’d produce or demonstrate what we did and make clear what you did not complete. Then I’d let the prof decide the grades.
  
  Unfortunately I had to do stuff like this more than once in some of my classes.

  Request to the professor to either kick you out of the group after everyone else has completed it with me, or if that’s not possible then give you poor peer review scores so you receive an F grade to reflect the work effort you did.

   Why do people only condemn Hitler for killing 6 million Jews but not Mao Tse Tung who killed 30 Million Chinese by starving them to death? 🙄

  People definitely DO condemn Chairman Mao for the atrocities he enacted on Chinese people. He killed more people under his poor leadership than Joseph Stalin and Adolph Hitler. However it’s not a part of western history so it isn’t taught as rigorously in (at least in my experience) American schools. For some reason American education is much more centered on what historically happened in Europe and the US

  Hmmm, that’s a complicated subject to which I don’t have a straightforward answer.
  
  A lot of girls I know see these broken ass men with all these unresolved personal issues and sometimes weird toxically masculine personality crises and think that they can help them or “fix” them. That’s what a lot of women I know like to and want to do; lots of women have strong “helper” instincts, motherly instincts.
  
  But everyone knows that the only person who can change someone is themselves. It’s easy to get caught up in trying to “change” your man because you know that he could better himself and be happier. But a lot of times men don’t want help and only see it as confusing and annoying.
  
  That’s just from my personal experiences and that’s just my opinion, but still an angle to consider

  Poor people are happier because they can appreciate the simple things in life, they usually know the value of a dollar a lot better than rich people, and they have to work for what they have.

   Why do people will always blame the mistress instead of the wife who has her shortcomings?
  ","
  They should blame the man and the mistress because it was them who decided to cheat.
  
  The man could’ve spoken to the wife about the wife’s shortcomings with her in a non-accusatory and civil conversation and discussed his feelings instead of going behind her back with another woman. Then they could’ve made a positive change in their relationship or ended things if they were unhappy.
  
  And the mistress should feel ashamed if she knew she was helping the man cheat and should also share the blame because she chose to do that and that’s just slimy on both the man and mistress’s parts.

   You know what, we need to stop being politically correct in this country. Are we Americans getting insensitive all of a sudden? Give me a frickin’ break!
  ","
  It’s a balance just like everything in life. Americans haven’t “gone soft” or whatever, this is now the age of information! We know so much now and info can be disseminated to so many people a million times quicker than it used to. That can get out of control of course and be used to push extremist ideology but it also means we don’t have to stick to rigid social norms and structure anymore. A shift from traditional (sometimes racist and sexist) ideals has been bubbling up for hundreds of years and it’s finally surfacing now in the 2000’s.
  
  Should we kick out Asian-American citizens because they “started” coronavirus? Fuck no dude what is this the playground in elementary school?
  
  Plus we already tried stuff like that SEVERAL times in the past and it turned out horribly and nothing was accomplished except people’s lives were ruined or they died.
  
  For example that’s literally exactly what we did during WWII to Japanese Americans and it’s now considered a national tragedy to be embarrassed of. That’s exactly what happened to disabled, Jewish, Gypsy, and black people across Europe during WWI and look at the way the world now views Germany. That’s also exactly what Stalin did during The Great Purge (and several other smaller genocides) in Russia and we now view them as damn dirty commies.
  
  All that because of some ideal that leaders thought was “right” and would “cleanse” the nation of someone who was impure, dirty, sick, or immoral.
  
  Long story short everything is a balance. Subjugating and separating a group of people because of their ancestry and country of origin is beyond ridiculous. It won’t solve anything.  I could go on about the further detriments of randomly deporting people of Asian descent from the US but this reply would turn into more of an essay tbh so I’ll stop here.
  
  I just wanna say that this issue has nothing to do with being politically correct or not or being a “lib” or whatever and everything to do with knowledge, open-mindedness, compassion, and understanding of each other and the human condition. Why can’t we all use our brains and think together instead of squabbling prettily over whodunnit? All seems a bit silly to me.

232502,"
   Why do we need to kick out all the Asian and Asian-Americans from the United States? Corona virus 🦠 perhaps?

We need to test all our citizens and adhere to coronavirus social distancing guidelines because they’ve proven to work in reducing the spread. The whole world is already on board with that but the United States can’t seem to get its shit together

   People often say that men are told to be tough and not express feelings, but have you ever actually heard someone say that kind of thing to a guy?
  ","
  Yeah definitely. Growing up, I saw that girls were always taught to talk about and process emotions with others, that crying was okay, and that it’s okay to make mistakes; but when I saw boys cry or mess up or get frustrated it was always “toughen up”, “man-up”, “boys don’t cry”, “it’ll build character”, or “don’t be a sissy”.
  
  And now after spending a bunch of time casually hanging out with my boyfriend’s friends over the past year or so it’s even more apparent. Now we’re all in our mid 20’s  and I still hear them say that normal things like expressing any emotion like love, sadness, fear...anything other than anger... is somehow “gay” and “bad”. I’ve heard them call each other little bitches and gayboys and faggots etc. for liking to do activities like art or singing, for liking animals, flowers, certain colors, or certain music. Some of them I can honestly reallyyy tell that they’re putting up a front. Like they’re stifling their own personalities so they can conform to some made-up social norm that they think is the “right” way to be.
  
  My experience with toxic masculinity has been much worse in the Southern US than up north. I guess it’s because the people in the south like to teach and embrace more conservative values than people up north tend to

   How expensive is it to own a horse?

  There are a lot more up-front costs if you’re going right into buying a horse since you could stand to spend a few thousand for an animal that’s well trained and safe to ride. Then there’s vet, farrier, feed, and boarding bills (only if you don’t have your own place to keep them which I don’t)...not to mention if you don’t have equipment for riding and taking care of them you’ll have to get that stuff too so that’s a few more thousand right there. If you already have the stuff then it’s not too bad. Probably a few hundred a month in upkeep and care just lots of money to get everything you need in the first place

   Do you prefer tough guys or girly guys?
  ","
  Kinda a rant but long story short I’d have to say “girly”...but the whole thing is fucking stupid imo. Here’s why:
  
  The notion of “Tough” guys grosses me out.  Most “tough guys” are absolutely consumed in trying to live up to some toxic standard of masculinity that’s been forced down on them. Dudes get told that they have to appear, act, and speak a certain way in order to be a “real” man but that’s just dumb. People get so caught up in doing what a man “should” do that they become an absolute shell of a person who’s too afraid of looking “ gay” or girly that they don’t let themselves actually BE THEMSELVES. I see people around me end up trying so hard to look and act “tough” and to “man up” and “be a man” that they lose themselves. And guys who are considered “girly” are usually people who don’t care about that ideal of what a man “should” be and then they just be themselves and therefore that’s “girly”. It really sucks to see men out there who’ve never been complimented, or payed attention to, or expressed their feelings instead of bottling it up, for their whole lives so they have to act like nothing bothers them and they’re some sort of robot with no feelings...that shits a literal tragedy

232559,"
   nothing make you wild angry and violent ?
  ","
  No I don’t like violence or anger, it’s really not my thing. I’m usually a very even tempered person. It’s very hard for me to become angry tbh.
  
  Imo people who get angry or violent while drinking it’s because they have issues within themselves that they need to solve, not issues with alcohol. Alcohol itself doesn’t “make” them act that way, it’s their conscious choice to act badly and then blame it on the liquor and say it’s all because of drinking. That’s true evil in my eyes. When people behave like violent, loud, wild animals it’s disgraceful...humans are so much smarter than that! Everyone knows that the only person who can control your actions is yourself! People who act out that way have little self control and self discipline...in a way it seems to me like it’s a cry for help. Nobody who is a happy, kind, caring, person would act that way unless something was wrong or bothering them.
  
  If a person can’t stay calm and rational while drinking then it seems to me that they’re just using alcohol to vent their frustrations instead of dealing with them in a healthy way like talking about it, writing it down, or redirecting the negative energy the feel into something constructive or creative.

   Hi there! It's morning for me (just past 10am), and I just woke up a little bit ago realizing I don't dream much anymore. So my question for you is: How often would you say you dream?

  No not really I guess. I’ve been to other countries and people’s idea of a typical American is usually a fat, unintelligent, lazy, gun toting, environment-destroying, money hungry, idiot waving the American or confederate flag behind their pickup truck yelling YEE YEE 🤠 Ive seen the way people look at us and they’re right... American culture can be pretty gross :/ I just don’t feel like I fit that description after realizing what the world thinks of us. I try to be conscious!

  ","
  Almost never because most pickup lines just end up sounding really creepy imo. Just being a normal, nice person, and striking up a conversation is always much better. When men say pickup lines to me it’s usually in the context of some sort of cat call so it’s automatically gross 😷🙅🏼🙅🏽‍♀️🙎‍♀️

  I like that I’m very patient and that I don’t anger easily. I like that I’m forgiving and kind but I wish I could toughen up sometimes and not wear my heart on my sleeve so much. It’s gotten in the way for me making some tough (but still necessary) decisions before

  To be happy, acquire enough wealth to live comfortably, marry the love of my life, own a small scale horse boarding and training facility + 1 or 2 of my own horses, have a few dogs, and compete with the horses at high levels! I don’t feel like I’ll ever be super rich but I’m okay with that. I just want to strike out on my own :)
  "
232691,"
   What is your favorite word and why?

  Hmmm I dunno. I’d say maybe it’s more a favorite phrase. I find myself saying “good boy” a LOT since I’m always with my animals and they all happen to be males lol

232692,"
   Have you been injured from horseback riding?
  ","
  Unfortunately yes. When I was about 15 I broke my wrist after being thrown off when the horse tripped. The same year I was kicked in the kneecap by the same horse when he was afraid of a giant bug biting him. Put me on crutches for months. I’ve been stepped on countless times and jammed all my fingers at least a million times too. I’ve had lots and lots of bumps and bruises but (knock on wood) only one broken bone that I knew about and got treated

  ","
  I think I’d be similar to Beast Boy from the original animated series Teen Titans. I’d turn into a small animal when I needed to be stealthy or get away from something/someone and id turn into a big flashy animal for when I wanted to reach something high up or show off for friends or carry heavy things. I’d be something cool like a giraffe or an elephant or a cheetah or a horse or something. And maybe if o needed to be small I’d be a fly or a mouse

  I actually got into it by happenstance! My dad was in the US Navy so we had to move to Germany for his job and live there for around 3 years when I was 9.

My mom saw an ad for riding lessons at a local stable and decided to enroll me....and the rest is history! I’ve loved it ever since

  If you’re asking if that feeling is valid then sure. All feelings are valid. You’re the only one who can control how you feel about something.

   Tell me a fact about horses
  ","
  Humans have selectively bred race horses to be very fast....so fast, that their bodies can’t keep up. Racing Thoroughbreds often breathe so hard while running in races that their lungs beat harshly on their rib cages during breathing. This can cause internal bleeding of the lungs which can then come out of the nose. Since horses aren’t physically  capable of breathing from their mouths, they can choke and suffocate on their own blood. This is sometimes why you see trainers keeping horses noses way up in the air after particularly hard races (to not let the blood flow from their noses)

   what kind of horse breeds do you hv?
  ","
  I personally don’t own any horses at the moment but I’m currently working with the sweetest little Anglo-Arab gelding named Chance!
  
  I’ve previously worked with a bunch of different breeds but namely lots of OTTB’s, a few warmbloods and warmblood x’s, and some quarter horses and appendixes.
  
  I’ve been documenting my horse adventures on my YT channel since about 2012 if you were interested in seeing any of them! (I was so young back then 😅)

   Should animal hunting be banned?
  ","
  In some cases YES but in some cases NO! Hunting endangered or threatened species (aka poaching) is a cruel disservice to the the animal, the species, and the world! That should and already IS obviously banned. However, hunting plentiful and sometimes overpopulated animal species like white-tailed deer, pheasants, or bear for the purposes of wildlife management and for food is actually beneficial to the environment, to the species, and to humans! My degree is in this field of study so if anyone wants to open a discussion hmu 💁🏽‍♀️

  And horses can sense that fear which in turn can them tense!
  
  They’re here animals so when you’re scared too they automatically think: “Why are we afraid? Is there a predator around? Should I run away?”
  
  I’ve always been enamored with horses’ beauty and strength and size so I guess I can’t relate :/ Maybe you need to start interacting will smaller horses first so you can get to know their behaviors and body language? Maybe try hanging out with a pony for a while first!

  I don’t think so. Horses are so big and powerful that if they don’t want to do something we’re asking they won’t do it! If a horse didn’t like what we were doing or what we were asking they have ways of letting us know. Paying attention to your animal’s body language is key!

   Have you ever been knocked out?

  Okay so actually yeah but not from a person (of course). One time when I was 9 we were living in Germany and my German horse trainer had taken me along with her to show her Shire mare at a local competition. I was given a lot of free rein around the show grounds and didn’t have a lot of supervision. I kind of didn’t understand a lot of what was going on around me since I couldn’t understand that much German at the time so I just did what I wanted. I decided I wanted to brush off the horse in the stall she was in and when I was picking one of her back hooves she kicked out and smacked me right in the middle of the forehead with her dinner plate sized hoof and knocked me out cold. That’s when I learned not to stand behind the horse when you pick out its feet!! Not sure how long I was laying there in the straw but I woke up and just decided not to tell anybody and just carried on with what I was doing 😂
  "

   How to tell when my horse is angry?
  ","
  Horses will explicitly tell us when they’re angry. You just have to know how to listen. Watch their body language. Since horses cannot talk like people can, we need to look for signs like pinning their ears back, having tense muscles, stomping and pawing, kicking, tail swishing, biting, and showing the whites of their eyes
  "

  Lunging a horse is not aggressive. You must be thinking about lunging like the action of springing forward at somebody aggressively like a dog attacking something. Lunging is a term for a type of exercise for the horse that involves building muscle by keeping a bend on a circle around a trainer holding a long line attached to the horses bridle.

  ","
  Learning to ride involves a lot of muscles in our bodies that were not used to using and has a lot of moving parts. It can be challenging to keep track of all of the things you need to do and even can be challenging just a learn how to relax on a horse. If you decide it is some thing you want to do and you’re dedicated enough and have lots of support and help from your trainer and your family anybody can learn to ride a horse!

  ","
  A horse with chrome is a horse with white leg markings and face markings
  "
232997,"
   Can a horse throw up or no
  ","
  No! Unlike most other mammals horses lack the ability to throw up. This is because there is a valve in their stomach that is only one way and does not allow food to come back up there esophagus. Their esophagus is so long that it would take too long to come out and they would choke on their vomit before it came out of their mouth. Horses are also unable to breathe out of their mouths so if they were to vomit they would probably choke from not being able to breathe as well.
  "
232998,"
   Horse is mammal?

  Yes, horses are mammals. They give birth to live young, have hair, have warm blood and are able to thermal regulate, and produce milk for their offspring.
  "
232999,"
   Riding horses is abuse. Horses are meant to be wild and free and your forcing them to do what you want and its cruel. Everything abo equestrian sports is so disgusting
  ","
  That’s a very interesting opinion. I’m glad you feel so passionate about the equestrian world. Keep in mind that horses are no longer wild animals and humans have made them what they are today. If humans were to disappear from the earth then most horse breeds and individual horses would die without our care. “Wild” horses of today are actually a misnomer. The term should be “feral” horses, as they are domesticated animals that are considered free range livestock. I’m sorry you feel the equestrian world is so bad :(
  "
233000,"
   Do you think horses are smart like smarter than a dog?
  ","
  Horses are most definitely smart! It’s hard to really gauge how “smart” an animal is since we can’t know for sure what’s going on in their heads but horses are known to be able to read human emotions, remember places, objects, smells, and words, and be able to bond with humans socially. We tend to think dogs are “smarter” because they’re pack animals with similar social needs and are much better at distinguishing between positive and negative reinforcement and human emotions, however, this is probably a product of their breeding. Humans selectively bred dogs to be better companions, but we selectively bred horses for their athletic and physical prowess, not as companion animals. That’s probably why most people would consider dogs to be smarter. However, horses consistently score better on the “smartness scale” than other domestic animals like cows and house cats!

  Are you seriously asking me if I’ve ever in my whole life had to fart....?
  "
233430,"
   Question is why are females shy to say they fart? I mean are you personally tbh?
  ","
  Because generations and generations of people have told females specifically that it’s “unladylike” and that they shouldn’t do it because it’s “improper” or that it’s disgusting or that “women just don’t do that” while when men fart it’s looked at as funny or manly or a joke. I do think it’s rude to do it on purpose in a closed space like in a car or somewhere else cramped where you can’t get away but everyone has to sometimes. It’s just a side effect of digesting food

  Donald Trump and Mike Pence suddenly both stepped down from office and neither they nor any racist, homophobic, or misogynistic individual were ever heard from again. All wars and senseless killing ceased and humans learned to live together in peace with both each other and all other organisms on earth. Climate change slowed as humans ceased burning too many fossil fuels and the earth returned to its normal glacial-interglacial cycle as CO2 levels dropped to pre-industrial levels. Over harvesting was no longer an issue because the human population decreased to well below carrying capacity and reached equilibrium.Everyone was happy and lived out their days with enough resources to go around and were all free of disease until they died of old age.

   What do you think about vegans who feed their dogs vegan dog food? Do they have the right to force their diet on their carnivorous pets? BQ: I've seen vegans say they don't trust meat eaters to look after their pets but would you trust a vegan to look after your dog properly, in terms of feeding??
  ","
  I didn’t even know there was such a thing as vegan dog food? That seems silly...Dogs aren’t meant to eat anything other than meat, they’re obligate carnivores.That’s why it’s so bad to feed your dog human food. Their digestive systems aren’t meant to handle plant material. That’s why they eat grass when they feel sick to make themselves throw up. Humans aren’t like that, we are omnivores so we have the capability to digest plant material as well as meat. I think it’s a wonderful thing for a human to choose to be vegan but a very cruel act to force a dog or any other animal that is an obligate carnivore to conform to that diet

   Would you rather have an electrical car or a regular one?
  ","
  Regular. Electric cars seem like a good idea but the electricity they run on is still created by burning coal in many cases. It also takes the same amount of metal to be mined from the earth to make the other parts of the car, not to mention a whole lot of lithium for the large battery it needs. It still takes the same amount of gasoline in ocean liners and air planes to ship the raw materials to where the car is made and then the same amount of gasoline to ship the built car to a dealership to be sold. It’s a good thought but I don’t see how it’s going to make a difference unless lots of other factors can be also made greener

  ","
  While we’re dating we don’t argue too much and we don’t fight. There’s no point in that, it’s a waste of energy. People I date are kind, caring, and open minded. I like hanging out with their friends and when they hang out with mine. We spend time together and enjoy the little things like waking up near each other, holding hands, eating together, and going on fun little dates. Sometimes it doesn’t work out even if we were in love though. In the past they have ended because one of us wanted something different in life, one person had to move away, or we lost interest in each other. My longest relationship was about a year

234464,"
   Why did you stop riding
  ","
  I didn't really mean to. It's been about 6 months since I've sat on a horse and I feel like part of me is missing :( it was a combination of losing my confidence due to a difficult situation with a former coach, me quitting the collegiate team I was on for the same reason, and me injuring myself from a fall that caught me off guard. I feel like I need to start over and go back to basics. I'm frustrated at myself and the situation because in my head I know exactly what to do, but I now get nervous at things that didn't use to phase me and I can't ride at the same level I was previously at before starting college.

  One time, I broke into this abandoned house in the woods with a few friends at night. The owner had obviously just got up and left one day, because everything was just as he'd left it. There was even food in the fridge and dishes in the sink, and they looked as if they'd been there for years. He was an art collector/artist so there were lots of weird giant paintings everywhere on the walls...very freaky. We even found some really old photos that looked like they had to have been from the 60,s or 70's of the guy and his wife while they'd been living in the house. That's how we knew the owner had been an elderly guy. I wonder if he'd died in the house?!
